# HAAG Repo Requirements
The code base requirements are the following:

- The instructor has to clearly be able to see the code you wrote each week.
- Each project needs to have its own repo that is (1) public and (2) part of this organization.
- Code contributions need to be tracked for publication attributions.
- Code needs to be marked as either: in-progress, tested and documented, or abandoned.
