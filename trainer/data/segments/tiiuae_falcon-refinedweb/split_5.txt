Increased truck transportation in Europe and its accompanying environmental problems, particularly along the north-south route through the Alps in western Europe, has prompted the expansion of railways in that region. These railways will need to tunnel through the Alps, requiring deeper and longer tunnels than any in existence.
Professor Herbert Einstein of civil and environmental engineering discussed three of these tunnels and issues of exploration and construction, mostly with regard to the difficult geologic conditions, in his Feb. 18 AAAS talk on "New Transalpine Transportation Tunnels."
Einstein focused on three tunnels: the 57km Gotthard Tunnel and the 36km Loetschberg Tunnel, which are both under construction in Switzerland, and the 53km Maurienne-Ambin Tunnel between France and Italy, which is in the advanced planning stage. All three will accommodate both high-speed passenger and freight trains.
"In a nutshell, the difficulties arise because these tunnels are going to be deeper than present tunnels, they will also be longer and the overburden (or pressure from rock and water above) will be greater," said Einstein.
"In addition, as you go deeper into the Earth, it gets hotter, so you have temperatures in the 50 degree C. range, which makes for difficult working conditions. We'll have to cool the work area; otherwise people will die. They have the same problem in the South African mines; it's difficult but not impossible," he said.
Tunnel builders will encounter a major geologic problem in areas where the geology is soil-like, rather than rock. Soil or weak rocks are unable to withstand high pressures from above; unlike solid rock, which can handle a high overburden, weak material will be prone to collapse. They will have to make special considerations for construction in these "bad zones," Einstein said.
"Imagine when you were a child playing in a sandbox. If you wanted to dig a small tunnel, you couldn't because the sand would collapse. That's what could happen in one of these tunnels, if appropriate measures are not taken," he said.
Einstein has developed a modeling tool that takes into consideration the factors and uncertainties involved to help managers estimate the costs and time for building the tunnels.
"As you know from local large construction projects," said Einstein, referring to Boston's Big Dig, "it's very difficult to estimate what these will cost."
A version of this article appeared in MIT Tech Talk on February 27, 2002.

Superfund-sponsored clean-ups of hazardous waste sites should improve the housing market in nearby neighborhoods, right? Not so says Michael Greenstone, the 3M Professor of Environmental Economics at MIT.
In a paper to be published in the August issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Greenstone and a colleague compared housing markets surrounding hazardous waste sites chosen for Superfund clean-ups to those surrounding sites that narrowly missed qualifying for Superfund remediation. Greenstone's hypothesis was that people living nearby value the clean-ups. He tested whether neighborhoods adjacent to Superfund sites became more desirable after clean-ups.
Superfund, a federal government program that cleans up the largest and most dangerous hazardous waste sites in the US, was signed into law in 1980. Almost 1600 sites have been identified and made eligible for federally led cleanups. Clean-up activities have been concluded at approximately two-thirds of these sites. The average cost of a completed cleanup is estimated at more than $55 million. The expected cost to clean-up the remaining sites is an additional $30 billion.
Greenstone finds that the clean-ups failed to cause increases in house prices or rental rates. Indeed, the changes in prices and rental rates are equal to the changes in the neighborhoods surrounding the hazardous waste sites where clean-ups did not take place. In addition, the populations of the neighborhoods and rate of new home construction remained at their pre clean-up levels.
The paper also finds that the average clean-up takes 12-13 years to complete and costs around $55 million. "The lengthy interventions are disruptive and very expensive," said Greenstone. "The housing market's clear message is that the clean-ups are not worth it to the people living near these sites."
Greenstone is now investigating whether there are health benefits from these clean-ups.
"We are facing a wide range of environmental problems, including the severe threats to our well being posed by climate change and water and air pollution," Greenstone said. "The findings suggest that less ambitious clean-ups like the erection of fences, posting of warning signs around the sites, and simple containment of toxics would free up resources to address environmental problems that have a higher payoff."
This work was funded in part by the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at MIT. Greenstone's co-author, Justin Gallagher, is a graduate student at UC Berkeley.

Kevin Blackwell brushed off calls for his head from sections of the home support after Bury went down 2-1 to Colchester at Gigg Lane.
The Shakers remain rooted to the foot of npower League One despite taking the lead through Craig Fagan and playing against 10 men for the majority of the contest following George Porter's fourth-minute sending-off.
"I'm full of praise for the players, they were terrific," said Blackwell. "It just didn't fall for us.
"There seemed to be a force field around their goal. We've had 51 crosses, 16 shots on target and 15 off.
"When you're at the bottom, you've missed chances and the fans are frustrated it's easier to hang the manager out to dry.
"But I don't know what else I could have done other than gone on and scored myself.
"If we'd scored six or seven you'd have been eulogising, but we lost and suddenly the whole thing changes.
"Other than deal with two or three chances a bit better, what more can you ask the players to do?
"I've got no complaints with them. I feel for them but that's the way it is, when you're down there you get kicked in the teeth."

Hi Jessica, et al.
You should be aware that in the functional area - there is a proposal to
say that conformance to the technical provisions would mean automatic
fulfillment of the FPC. There is a statement in a government FAQ and in
preamble that supports this point of view at least for software aspect.
Thus - if "support for AT" but not "compatibility with actual AT" is all
that is required in the technical requirements - then working with actual AT
would not be required anywhere.
The questions therefore are:
- when the AT industry agreed on the technical provisions did they
understand them to say that "support for AT" (e.g. an API) was sufficient to
meet the technical provision or did they understand the wording to mean that
the software had to work with actual AT. That is, do they require companies
to work with AT industry to make sure their products work - or could
industry just build to an API and say the rest of the problem belongs to the
AT companies.
- this is not to say that the companies here don't work with AT companies
today. The question is simply - do the new 508 regs REQUIRE that companies'
products work with AT? Or do the regs only require that products have an AT
interface - and it is up to AT to work with what is there?
There was also a statement on the list that this was just a problem between
AT and IT and it was only their concern. I believe that there is a
substantial issue for people who have disabilities too.
- With the "products need to work with AT" approach - products purchased
would have AT and could be used by employees with disabilities.
- With the "support for AT" approach - products could pass 508 if they had
an AT interface even if there was not AT that worked with them. That would
mean that there is no requirement that products that passed 508 would in
fact be usable by employees with disabilities.
So I think people with disabilities also have a concern or interest
in this distinction. So I don't think it is purely an AT-IT industry
concern.
Since we have the final Software Call today at 1 EST before the lock down
this is important.
This is not a new or last minute issue. It has been brought up repeatedly
but the language is now solidifying -- and there appears to be a problem
with different people interpreting the same language in different ways.
The current wording can be read either of the two ways discussed above.
We need to at least add a note that clearly states which interpretation is
intended by the language - so that we can determine if consensus exists for
the language or not. And if so - does it mean "provides and interface that
AT can use?" or does it mean "Works with AT that exists".
PS
Suggestion
1) that we say that conformance with 508 means that it works with AT.
2) that if there are no products that work with AT then the agency should
purchase the product that has an API for AT as a fallback to leave best
opportunity for access in the future.
But to purchase a product with an API but no AT instead of a product that
works with real AT should not be "ok" or what the 508 regs allow.

HOUSE.
VIGO COUNTY COURTS.
The Committee on Organization of Courts, to which was referred the bill [H. R. 17] in relation to the establishment of a Superior Court in Vigo County, reported the same back with a recommendation that the bill pass.
A minority report was also submitted recommending that the bill do lie upon the table.
Mr. MORGAN said, as a Representative from Vigo County, he wanted to see the minority report voted down and the majority report concurred in. Ten years ago, there was a bill passed the Legislature providing for a Criminal Court to be established in Vigo County. At that time the population of Terre Haute was about 17,000 and the County, perhaps, 35,000. Since then the population of Terre Hute has increased about 10,000, having now nearly 27,000 inhabitants. There has been a difference of opinion among the people as to whether Vigo County needs another County Court of civil jurisdiction, We all agree upon one point, that is, that the Circuit there is very much behind in its business, and it, perhaps, will never catch up until the County is given another Court of jurisdiction. Men of all parties and members of the Bar insist emphatically on the passage of a bill to establish a Superior Court in that County, and abolish the Criminal Court. In accordance with that wish this bill was drafted and submitted to various lawyers of all political parties, and was brought here thinking it was merely carrying out the wish of the people of that County.
By Mr GIBSON--There is a bill on the calendar to extend to the Criminal Court now in existence, civil jurisdiction concurrent with the Vigo Circuit Court. This bill [H. R. 17] is a bill to abolish the Criminal Court and create a Superior Court. It is my desire in considering these two bills to get at the merits of the provisions. It appears to me that the bill [H. R. 80] extending to the Criminal Court of Vigo County civil jurisdiction, had all the evidences of economy in it, and I verily believe that if every Member of this House could understand these two bill, that the report of the minori ty in this case would prevail. For instance, $800 salary is paid by the State of Indiana to the Judge of the Superior Court. We are here, or ought to be, as watch-dogs of the Treasury. Now, the salary of the Judge and Prosecuting Attorney of the Criminal Court is paid by the County of Vigo. The State of Indiana does not pay $1 for running that Court. If you abolish the Criminal Court and create a Superior Court, the State of Indiana has to pay $800 for the salary of the Judge. I hope the report of the minority will prevail.
By Mr. KENNER: To hitch civil jurisdiction on the Criminal Court, never ought to be done, but we propose by special action to give them civil jurisdiction. By this bill a Circuit Court is created with entire civil jurisdiction, having no criminal jurisdiction whatever, and the criminal jurisdiction is to be transferred to where it belongs and where the statute places it-in the hands of the Circuit Court. He favored the majority report.
Mr. SINCLAIR, being one of the members of that Committee, said: We acted with a view of carrying out a policy, one that I think should be carried out, and that is, not to pass any laws or repeal any, without strong reasons. At the time we acted we had just two bills before us. One was to prevent, as my colleague says, the extension of the jurisdiction, and the other was for the purpose of establishing a new office or new Court and abolishing the other one. At the time we acted, we had before us a petition from some of the best lawyers in the County of Vigo, asking to extend the Criminal Court jurisdiction. Among the number was our present United States Senator. The names of Mr. Voorhees, Mr. Carleton and some sixteen Republicans were on that petition. After that, inasmuch as the people of Vigo County, two years ago, by their choice elected two men to fill the offices of that Court, respect ought to be given to the voice of the people.
The gentleman from Vigo, who advocates the abolition of the Criminal Court and the establishment of a Superior Court, was elected to the place he holds here by that same people. Now, what I want to know is, do the majority of the people of Vigo County demand this? For my part, I do not favor the abolishment of a Court without strong reasons, Where there is an opportunity given to the citizens of the County to be relieved in any be other way, I think it is not the policy of the law to legislate men out of office and legislate others in. My friend across the way always mixes up politics, and sometimes talks about the Democratic party being legislated into Heaven; but that is no reason why Democratic officers of Vigo County should be legislated out of office and Republicans legislated in. I do not think that is our purpose here, and these are the reasons which actuated the minority of that Committee.
Mr. MORGAN--These fact are well known: That the salary of the Judge will be $800, and that amount will be paid out of the State Treasury; but you must bear in mind also that the Prosecutor whom we abolish will not receive his salary, and there is $500 in our favor, so that will only be $300 out of the State Treasury. I want to know gentlemen, if the citizens of Vigo County need this Court In the interest of justice, I want to know if it is economy to prevent the people of that County from hav- page: 122[View Page 122] ing judgment speedily and without delay on account of $300, when other Counties in this State have Superior Courts? I have not made this a party question, but ask every one here to put aside politics and vote for the majority report.
The yeas and nays were demanded by Messrs. Cauthorne and Cole, and the vote on the adoption of the minority report was--yeas, 33; nays, 54. So the minority report was rejected.
The majority report was concurred in, and the bill was ordered engrossed.
Mr. LINDLEY submitted a report from the majority of the Committee on the Organization of Courts on the bill [H. R. 80] in relation to civil jurisdiction of the Criminal Court of Vigo County, and recommended that it do lie on the table.
Mr. GIBSON submitted a report from the minority of the same Committee, recommending the passage of the bill.
The minority report was laid on the tably by--yeas, 55; nays, 30.
The majority report was concurred in.
Mr. GIBSON, from the Committee on Organization of Courts, submitted a report on the bill [H. R. 107] establishing a Superior Court in the County of Vanderburgh, with a recommendation that the bill pass.
The report was concurred in, the bill read the second time and ordered engrossed.
The bill [H. R. 66] to legalize the incorporation, etc., and ordinance for issuing bonds of the town of Chauncey, was read the third time, and passed by yeas, 83; nays, 2.
The bill [H. R. 199] to amend an act prescribing who may make a will, the effect thereof, what may be devised, regulating the admission to probate, revocation and contest, etc., was read the second time.
Mr. SINCLAIR--Inasmuch as the House took a recess of ten minutes to shake hands with Senator Voorhees a short time ago, I move that we take a recess of ten minutes now to shake hands with Ben Harrison, United States Senator-elect.
The motion was agreed to.
When the SPEAKER had commanded order--
Mr. McDowell filed a motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday on the resolution to appoint a Committee to investigate the propriety and expediency of establishing a new State Educational Institution.
The bill [H. R. 141] regulating the sale of brass, iron or other worn or scrap metal by railroad officials was read the second time.
Mr. KENNER said this was to remedy a wrong so prevalent at our large railroad shops. After night there are poor children running loose, picking up iron scraps, which they sell to junk dealers. You can not arrest these little children and confine them in Jail. This provision strike directly at the dealers to whom these commodities are sold. Prohibiting the sale of those articles puts an end to the stealing.
The House adjourned till to-morrow morning at 9 a.m.

Americans with high blood pressure, cholesterol go untreated
Nearly a third of all adults have high blood pressure and another third have high cholesterol, but most aren't being treated, leaving them at risk for developing heart attacks, strokes and related vascular diseases, according to new data out from the CDC.
Half of American adults with high blood pressure and two thirds of those with high cholesterol aren't getting adequate treatment, the agency reports.
And it's not lack of health insurance keeping people from the doctor. Some 80 percent of people with uncontrolled hypertension or high cholesterol have some form of coverage, the CDC reports.
So what's the problem? Well, while patients may have insurance, they may not have regular access to medical care, or the counseling and support needed to care for these chronic conditions. Others don't go to the doctor for follow-up visits and about half just stop taking their medicine all together.
Heart attack, stroke and other vascular diseases kill more 800,000 Americans a year and cost the nation about $300 billion a year in medical costs. Thing is, medications can control high blood pressure and high cholesterol before they become serious, the CDC urges.
The full report analyzed government data from 11,100 patients from 2005 to 2008 and found 68 million people with high blood pressure and 71 million with high cholesterol.
What exactly does it mean to have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, you ask? For blood pressure, a reading of 120 over 80 is considered normal and 140 over 90 indicates it needs to be managed. For cholesterol, the LDL or "bad cholesterol" is the key figure. It should be less than 160 for people without heart disease or diabetes, no more than 130 for people with two or more other risk factors for heart disease and below 100 for people with heart disease or diabetes.

With more than ever prepared and frozen foods sales, the labelling and declaration for health in weight and in percentages is necessary. Also they must conform to acceptable cholestoral levels, salt and sodium levels, sugar levels etc. They cannot and should not have excessive quantities. How can some of the labels have no food expiry dates? Is the FDA put a snooze button on, or are they lethargic to public health issues and concerns?

should contain the goals statement from the planning phase, as well as the structural details of the site.
These are big questions, and the broad conceptual issues are too often dismissed as committees push toward starting the "real work" of designing and building a Web site. However, if you cannot confidently answer all of these questions, then no amount of design or production effort can guarantee a useful result.
The site specification defines the scope of your project that is, what and how much you need to do, the budget, and the development schedule. "Scope creep" is the most prevalent cause of Web project failures. In badly planned projects, scope creep is the gradual but inexorable process by which previously unplanned "features" are added, content and features are padded to mollify each stakeholder group, major changes in content or site structure during site construction are made, and more content or interactive functionality than you originally agreed to create is stuffed in. No single overcommitment is fatal, but the slow, steady accumulation of additions and changes is often enough to blow budgets, ruin schedules, and bury what might have been an elegant original plan under megabytes of muddle. Although a page count is hardly infallible as a guide (after all, Web pages can be arbitrarily long), it serves as a constant reminder to everyone involved of the project's intended scope. If the page count goes up, make it a rule to revisit the budget implications automatically the cold realities of budgets and schedules will often cool the enthusiasm to stuff in "just one more page." A good way to keep a lid on scope creep is to treat the page count as a "zero sum game." If someone wants to add pages, it's up to them to nominate other pages to remove or to obtain a corresponding increase in the budget and schedule to account for the increased work involved.
Changes and refinements can be a good thing, as long as everyone is realistic about the impact of potential changes on the budget and schedule of a project. Any substantial change to the planned content, design, or technical aspects of a site must be tightly coupled with a revision of the budget and schedule of the project. People are often reluctant to discuss budgets or deadlines frankly and will often agree to substantial changes or additions to a development plan rather than face an awkward conversation with a client or fellow team member. But this acquiescence merely postpones the inevitable damage of not dealing with scope changes rationally.
The firm integration of schedule, budget, and scope is the only way to keep a Web project from becoming unhinged from the real constraints of time, money, and the ultimate quality of the result. A little bravery and honesty up front can save you much grief later. Make the plan carefully, and then stick to it.

ViewVC is a WWW interface for CVS and Subversion
repositories. It allows you to browse the files and directories in a
repository while showing you metadata from the repository history: log
messages, modification dates, author names, revision numbers, copy
history, and so on. It provides several different views of repository
data to help you find the information you are looking for:
A single installation of ViewVC is often used to provide access to
more than one repository. In these installations, ViewVC shows a
Project Root drop down box in the top right corner of every
generated page to allow for quick access to any repository.
By default, ViewVC will show the files and directories and revisions
that currently exist in the repository. But it's also possible to browse
the contents of a repository at a point in its past history by choosing
a "sticky tag" (in CVS) or a "sticky revision" (in Subversion) from the
forms at the top of directory and log pages. They're called sticky
because once they're chosen, they stick around when you navigate to
other pages, until you reset them. When they're set, directory and log
pages only show revisions preceding the specified point in history. In
CVS, when a tag refers to a branch or a revision on a branch, only
revisions from the branch history are shown, including branch points and
their preceding revisions.
In CVS directory listings, ViewVC can optionally display dead files.
Dead files are files which used to be in a directory but are currently
deleted, or files which just don't exist in the currently selected
sticky tag. Dead files cannot be
shown in Subversion repositories. The only way to see a deleted file in
a Subversion directory is to navigate to a sticky revision where the
file previously existed.
In CVS Repositories, ViewVC adds artificial tags HEAD and
MAIN to tag listings and accepts them in place of revision
numbers and real tag names in all URLs. MAIN acts like a branch
tag pointing at the default branch, while HEAD acts like a
revision tag pointing to the latest revision on the default branch. The
default branch is usually just the trunk, but may be set to other
branches inside individual repository files. CVS will always check out
revisions from a file's default branch when no other branch is specified
on the command line.
More information about ViewVC is available from
viewvc.org.

I can't seem to find white wedding shoes that I like anywhere, and I need to settle on a pair soon so I can have my final wedding dress fittings done while wearing the right heels. Is it way too tacky to wear wedding shoes that aren't white?
A.
Though brides traditionally wear shoes to match their wedding gowns (which are almost always some shade of white), you don't absolutely have to. In fact, many brides -- having gone conventional with the white dress -- choose to have a little more fun with their wedding footwear. You could have your shoes be your "something blue," or pick a metallic pair that matches with your jewelry or the embellishment on your gown. Or you can go really crazy with footwear that matches your interests -- we've seen brides walk down the aisle in everything from biker boots to custom-made cowboy boots (with the bride and groom's initials on them, naturally). Get out there and find a wedding shoe -- any shoe -- that you love. No matter what it's color, you're sure to put your best foot forward.

We have just returned from four days in our old neck of the woods visiting my wife’s relatives and celebrating Finnish Independence Day. On Dec. 6th, 1917, Finland adopted the Finnish Declaration of Independence and withdrew from Soviet Russia (very shortly after the USSR’s creation). This holiday holds special meaning for Finns, as I’m sure you can believe. Had they not declared their independence during this hectic period in Russia’s history, they could have been part of the Soviet Union until the 1990s like so many countries bordering Russia.
Each morning of our visit to Eastern Finland, we were greeted by a fresh blanket of snow (on top of the other blankets of snow) and temperatures ranging from -8 to -15*C (17.5 to 5*F). The sun didn’t shine much, but other than that it was pleasant to be outside. Part of our visit was spent at my wife’s grandparents’ farm, where we took the pictures below. They provide a glimpse of the early stage of winter we are in, as well as a look at some elements of a typical old Finnish farm.
Proudly flying the Finnish colors for Independence Day:
The old farm mill, which is no longer in use:
The smoke sauna can be seen here at the bottom left. Just beyond that is the creek which separates the farm from the neighboring property, which fills the rest of the picture:
The big old barn:
Hay field and woods:
Bunny tracks in the yard:
Berry bushes, asleep for the winter:
Here are the Woodswife and Woodsboy opening part of the barn so we can peek inside:
Inside that part of the barn is just some of the firewood they have stockpiled:
Before we headed inside, the Woodsboy took a tractor ride with great-grandpa:
Here’s an old photo showing great-grandpa when he himself was just a Woodsboy:
Four generations of proud Finns, going back well beyond the first Finnish independence day (my wife is generation 5, and the Woodsboy is generation 6):
The icing on the cake of a nice visit to the country was leaving with these:
Hand-knit wool over-socks, made by my wife’s grandmother. I can’t have enough pairs of these. Socks like these accompany me on every winter outing, and now I have a new favorite pair.
Thanks go out to the Woodswife for taking most of the pictures for this post. Fortunately, she has recently expressed interest in writing full articles about things like berry and mushroom picking, making preserves and juices, family/farm history etc., so you can expect to see them (eventually) here.
Let freedom ring!
Good stuff WW, digging the pics, man they’ve got some wood put back! Wow!
Thanks.
They certainly do have a lot of wood in the barn. Plenty more, too. I guess that’s what happens when you’ve got lots of trees, cold winters and lots of time.
Beautiful spot- heat with oil?
Yep, all that oil stacked in the barn.
They have a large wood stove/oven in the kitchen/living room and also have a few wall-mounted electric heaters for extra heat if needed.
Nice socks, I´m jealous!
It’s funny how people change over the course of their lives. When I was a kid, I never thought I’d be excited about getting a pair of socks. Today, different story.
Now THAT is a pile of firewood! Fascinating history and very cool that the farm has remained in the family.
On the other side of my wife’s family, there has been one house after another on the same site for a few hundred years (well, in any case they found the remains of 3 to 5 old foundations in the same spot).
Well, you sure did spend your time in a good way!
Guess the family will not have to worry about freezing this winter. Love the socks and I am looking forward to seeing your wife’s writings… as does my Mss.!
Thanks!

Thanks for the comments, I'm pretty unflappable when it comes to critiques being a graphic designer I'm used to both the positive and negative and in the end it is all good.
I took this image 19 years ago at 5am in Montreal - I pretty much used Tri-X 400 at that time. I believe this shot was 30 seconds but I also did several other exposures, I chose this one because of the light a passing bus left. I think that some of the lack of detail is due in part to film processing because I always had some difficulty when processing my own film even though I was diligent about the chemicals and temp, I eventually gave up doing them myself.
psychodudu said 2383 days ago:
This is a wonderful shot, the starlight effect from the streetlights is fantastic. I'm a little concerned that the strength of the light maybe took somehting away from the reflections in the water on the road, which couls have made it even more dramatic. You could conceivably have gone darker.
You could comment on this photo if you were logged in.
I like the mood here. The wet streets are great, and the shot works with the long light streak, though it could have worked just as well without. It seems like the image is slightly overexposed, so that a lot detail gets lost in the dark. How long was this, about 30 seconds? 20 might have done the trick, too. This is no criticism, I've been doing a lot shots like this, so I'm just trying to learn. I love working with a low ISO and tiny aperture so that I get lovely stars around street-lights, but I have found that it is quite easy to actually overexpose. Would love to know your settings on this one.
Anyway, high marks from me.

These shoes are so cute! I love making sock animals for my little boy.
efraz53(at)yahoo(dot)com
I've received these kind of shoes as gifts and thought they looked way to hard to make on my own. Perhaps I should actually try before throwing myself out of the rink.

I have been watching Microsoft transform slowly over a number of years, going through many transformations in the name of progress. However, my question is, how does this all fit together?
Although I am a true Microsoft user, I feel that at the moment, the delivery of Microsoft's services are getting very convoluted and confused. I think this is due in part to Microsoft's size, diversity and methodology.
The other day I set about trying to understand what has happened with Microsoft and why everything seems to have slowed down since the release of Phone7.
The main biting point I could find in the current slowdown of MS is the tablet form factor. Apple have re-invented the wheel once again with the iPad, convincing everyone that they need such a pointless device. This has now created an expectation in the market for an equivalent Microsoft device. The issue with this is that currently, Microsoft have no operating system available for such a form factor and from what I can find, no actual vision of what such a device should look like, work like or 'do'. Windows doesn't natively support touch and Microsoft don't think the Phone7 OS would suit a device of that size. I agree with them.

Bomb Explodes Outside U.S. Embassy In Turkey
Originally published on Fri February 1, 2013 1:09 pm
Transcript
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep.
RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:
And I'm Renee Montagne. An explosion described by the State Department as a terrorist attack shook the U.S. embassy in the capital of Turkey, Ankara. The American ambassador says a Turkish security guard was killed and at least one other person was seriously wounded. Turkish investigators are exploring the possibility that it was a suicide bombing. Joining us now from Istanbul is NPR's Peter Kenyon. And Peter, what do you know? What is the latest information about this explosion?
PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Well, the blast occurred, Renee, earlier in the afternoon local time at a security checkpoint just outside the embassy proper. Turkey's interior minister says it was a suicide attacker. If that is confirmed, the death toll would then rise to two, including the bomber. U.S. Ambassador Frank Ricciardone pushed his way through a swarm of police and journalists not long after the blast. He confirmed that one Turkish security guard had been killed and a woman seriously wounded, also a Turkish citizen. The State Department says it's cooperating fully with Turkish officials who launched an investigation.
MONTAGNE: Peter, many U.S. diplomatic missions around the world are heavily fortified and for very good reason, because there have been these attacks. What about the embassy there in Ankara?
KENYON: Yes. That is well-fortified, although unlike, for example, the U.S. consulate here in Istanbul, the embassy is on a busy main thoroughfare in Ankara. The entrance, however, is off the main street, on a side street, which has much less traffic. I was just in the embassy a week ago. The visitors entrance is a stand-alone security checkpoint that is not connected to the building itself. The blast ripped a hole in the outer wall of that checkpoint. But based on what can be seen from the outside, I think you'd have to say the security of the embassy proper was not compromised.
MONTAGNE: And what are people there in Turkey saying about who or what group may have been behind this attack?
KENYON: Well, it's very early, of course. But the interior minister here in Turkey is already pointing at a little-known left-wing splinter group. It's called the People's Revolutionary Front. He's offering no evidence for that so far. There have been explosions at diplomatic missions here in Turkey in the past, most dramatically in 2003. There were a series of bombs in Istanbul that year, including synagogues, a bank and the British consulate. And some 67 people died, including the British consul general that year. In this case, in addition to this left-wing group that's under suspicion, Turks are always on guard for Kurdish militant attacks. Some wonder if this isn't another effort to derail nascent peace talks underway between Turkey and the Kurds, a la the shooting of three Kurdish activists in Paris recently.
There's also concerns about Syria-related violence spilling over into Turkey, and always worries that Islamist militants linked to al-Qaida or some other group might refocus on targets in Turkey at some point. Again, the investigators are just beginning to sort through the evidence, and this is speculation at this point.
MONTAGNE: And quite a range of groups there, though.
KENYON: Yes, there's no question about it. Turkey lives in a volatile, tense neighborhood, and although it likes to say it has zero problems with the neighbors, there's plenty of problems in the neighborhood.
MONTAGNE: Well, just briefly, could this bombing have repercussions for the Turkish-U.S. relationship?
KENYON: Well, there have been a few rough spots in the U.S.-Turkey ties. Turkey, for instance, imports quite a bit of oil and gas from Iran, which is under sanctions. But on the question of terrorism and on many of the major geopolitical issues, the two countries are very tight. The ambassador's statement reflected that today. He was talking about Turkish-American friendship. So unless there's some very unusual development, such as Turkish nationalists somehow showing up as suspects - and there's been no evidence of that, I should add - I think, if anything, this will bring the two countries a bit closer together.
MONTAGNE: Peter, thanks very much.
KENYON: You're welcome.

Author Interviews
Gwyneth Paltrow On Tradition, Family And Duck Ragu
Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have to cook. She's a movie star. Her mother, Blythe Danner — a formidable actress herself — much preferred the stage to the kitchen. But Paltrow's father thrived there.
Bruce Paltrow was producer and director, mostly of TV hits, like St. Elsewhere. he was also a father who doted on his daughter — until he died, suddenly, nine years ago when he was just 58.
Now, Gwyneth Paltrow is out with a cookbook called My Father's Daughter, celebrating family and togetherness, as the subtitle puts it. Paltrow's passion for cooking began when she was a very young aspiring actress and found herself joining her father in the kitchen.
"I started to learn how to cook with him," she tells Morning Edition's Renee Montagne. "And it was something that we did together. We were so often side by side in the kitchen, just quietly chopping or whisking. It's a very physical memory that I get of him when I'm in the kitchen, it's almost like I can feel him standing behind me."
Paltrow explains that her father came from a big family, and meal-time was an important part of communication.
"He came from a house where the family dinner was very, very important," Paltrow says. "Every night my grandfather would have the whole family at the table at 6 to eat dinner all together, and my grandmother would cook, and they would all chat and it was their family time. He didn't grow up with a lot of money, so when he could afford to go out to restaurants and take us, he was so excited, and I think that's where I got the idea that food is very special and exciting."
My Father's Daughter features several recipes inspired by Bruce's kitchen experiments, including that for "Bruce's World-Famous Pancakes." Though the recipe is quite traditional — flour, buttermilk — Paltrow says that her father's version was always just a bit better than others she tried.
"They are honestly the best pancakes," she laughs. "They are thin, they're tangy. They're not these giant fluffy things. I think what made them world-famous is, well, everyone loved the taste of the pancakes, but it became such a thing that he would cook for all of us and our extended family. It was almost about the experience as much as the pancakes themselves."
In the cookbook, Paltrow offers some healthier alternatives to her family recipes. For example, she provides an alternative to her mother's blueberry muffin recipe that includes soy milk instead of whole milk, and vegetable oil in place of butter.When asked if her version tastes better, however, she demurs.
"No, no it doesn't," she admits. " Nothing tastes as good as my mother's super-fattening, sugary, blueberry muffins. [Mine] taste pretty good. But you can't beat the butter and sugar, let's face it."
Some of the recipes in My Father's Daughter feature foods that Paltrow herself does not eat — she doesn't eat red meat, for example, but she decided to include her family's brisket, as she has such fond memories of the dish from childhood.
"Basically, we grew up having brisket," she says. "It's the pride of the Jewish mother, to have her version of brisket. So even though I don't eat red meat anymore, I loved brisket, and I thought, we have to include it in the book. So I started doing research and asking all the women in my family...and it seemed that the secret ingredient was rubbing it with Lipton onion soup mix. I thought, lets do it a little more homemade than that."
Though the cookbook is already a bestseller, the public perception of Paltrow has not always been that of a culinary queen. In fact, she was famous for her limited macrobiotic diet around the time she won an Academy Award for Shakespeare in Love in 1998. She says that she was dieting this way as a response to her father's throat cancer diagnosis:
"When he was diagnosed with cancer, it was my absolute worst nightmare. And I thought, gosh, he's got to eat healthy. So I started doing all this research into how people allegedly cure themselves through macrobiotics and very healthy diets. I was hoping he would adapt some of these principles in the hopes that it would help his health, but he was pretty resistant. I think he equated sugar and caffeine with being healthy. So by proxy, I thought, I'll get really healthy, and somehow that will make him healthier. It didn't work, but I tried."
Paltrow says that every recipe in the book has a personal connection to her past, but none so poignant as that for duck ragu. The dish brings up the memory of the last great conversation she had with her father before his death.
"We were in Italy," she muses. "We had gone to Italy for my 30th birthday, and my present from my dad was that we were going to have a road trip through Tuscany and Umbria, and on the first night we went to this little town called Cortona, and he wasn't feeling well. I didn't know how unwell he actually was feeling, but we took a walk up the little cobblestone streets and we went to this little trattoria and we had duck ragu, and we had this incredible night where he really opened up. We had a heart to heart. It was our last ... our last conversation in a way, because it became about doctors and all of that after that night."
She continues: "If you could write your perfect last conversation with the person that you love most in the world, it would have been that night." Copyright 2011 National Public Radio. To see more, visit.

Dr. Pauline Chen on medical care.
Doctor and Patient
Dr. Pauline Chen on medical care. over a generation now, efforts to make health care more patient-friendly have focused on getting patients and doctors to work together to make decisions about care and treatment. Numerous research papers, conferences and advocacy organizations have been devoted to this topic of “shared decision-making,” and even politicians have clambered aboard the train, devoting several provisions in the Affordable Care Act to “preference-sensitive care.”
But one thing has been missing in nearly all of these earnest efforts to encourage doctors to share the decision-making process. That is, ironically, the patient’s perspective. researchers conducted several focus groups with 48 patients from five primary care physicians in the San Francisco Bay area. First, they showed the patient participants a short video on several equally effective but very different treatment approaches for a heart ailment. Then, they asked them questions about what they did with their own doctors when faced with a choice among several treatment options that might be equally effective but could differ in lifestyle effects, cost or range of complications. Finally, the researchers asked the participants if they were comfortable asking doctors about different treatments, discussing their values and preferences or disagreeing with their doctors’ recommendations. and an associate investigator in the Department of Health Services Research at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute in California. “But patients still aren’t perceiving the relationship as a partnership.”
Interestingly, most participants in this study were over 50, lived in affluent areas and had either attended or completed graduate school. “It’s hard to think that people from more disadvantaged backgrounds would find it any easier to question doctors,” Dr. Frosch said.
While understanding health care issues and making themselves heard in discussions were not difficult in general for the participants in the study, the skills and confidence they had in other settings appeared to have little relevance once they were in their doctors’ offices. They could not speak as easily as they normally did. “People experience a different sense of self in the doctor-patient interaction,” Dr. Frosch observed. “The clinical context creates a reluctance to be more assertive.”
Dr. Frosch and his colleagues are working on a larger study examining the extent to which patients feel constrained. And they have plans to study whether there are better ways to encourage patient engagement.
Systemic changes to increase shared decision-making must be addressed as well. Care organizations and doctors’ practices must be restructured to allow more in-depth conversations; clinicians need to be reimbursed for the time required for more meaningful conversations; and health care systems must adopt rigorous quality standards that measure and value real patient engagement in decisions.
“We urgently need support of shared decision-making that is more than just rhetoric,” Dr. Frosch said. “It may take a little longer to talk through decisions and disagreements; but if we empower patients to make informed choices, we will all do much better in the long run.”
Do you feel you need to act differently with doctors? Join in the discussion below.

Butts Brow is part of the South Downs and overlooks Willingdon Eastbourne it is a popular spot with walkers dog owners cyclists and car owners who just sit in the car park with a flask and snack.
It`s elevated position gives fine 180` panoramic views of the surrounding area.
We visited today for a walk and a chance for some fresh air, the weather was cold and windy with a watery sun so I took a few photographs while the sun was in the right position.
I was sad to see there is now a charge to park a car and I didn`t like the barbed wire that was obvious in several places.
It looks pretty soggy, even up there on the downs. That last picture is a great composition. The gate really attracts the eye: a sort of focal point.
I agree most pictures need a focal point Mark I am also of the opinion that if the sky has nothing to add to a picture leave it out
That looks to be an ideal, and welcome, walk for this time of year in the sunshine. Cheers.
And thanks for making commenting a lot easier!
Pleased it is easier now Mike
I'm glad you managed to get out and enjoy some fresh air. I learns o much looking at your images,I love the atmosphere of the last one.

2 this trial is an attempt to silence him — and them.
Arrest Sends Political Message
Even his youngest fans come to the courthouse in Casablanca, Morocco, to support him.
Rihab Alame, an 11-year-old girl, knows the words to all his protest songs. She shows up for every court appearance, despite four postponements of Belrhou fact, officially, the rapper's songs have nothing to do with his arrest. He was jailed on an assault charge after a brawl outside his house. Supporters say it was a setup. They add it is unusual that the attorney general of Casablanca is heading up the prosecution team for a simple assault charge. Belrhou.
That's why there is so much interest in the case, says Karim Tazi, a businessman and political activist.
"This case is a high-profile case. It's a symbolic case. He's only an artist – and they want to silence him," Tazi says.
In a way, this trial is also a test of the power of a protest movement that won concessions from the king after mass demonstrations last year. Morocco has a new constitution. Elections in November made moderate Islamists the leading party in the government.
That party has promised to reform Morocco's justice system. Human rights groups urged the new ministers to investigate the charges against a political rap star.
Tazi says that it's a loss for the regime either way.
"If they free him, he is going to come back and sing again. If they keep him in jail, they are adding fuel to the anger of the movement and bringing the movement back to life, so they are losing anyway," Tazi says.

A Look at 2012 Vin Scully Award Winner
.
Whether Al was broadcasting the greatest game, and eventually the greatest moment, in American sports history during the 1980 winter Olympics, calling any of eight Super Bowls, or hanging on for dear life in the broadcast booth at Candlestick Park, he carried out his work on the strength of an underlying axiom: get the facts right.
From a journalistic standpoint, it is the portion of this documentary that emerges as the headline. In a business that is built upon delivering accurate information, the facts are often muddled for the sake of speed, style, or personal interest of the journalist.
Michaels understands the reason for his presence. He does not burden the listener/viewer with superfluous information and he does not jam stories into a telecast. Michaels lets the game play out and he simply provides the proper eloquence when necessary.
From a small boy raised in Brooklyn, NY to an industry giant, perhaps the most impressive part about Al Michaels is the way he approaches his work. Always prepared, always factual, and, when the moment calls for it, always great.
Listen below to Al Michaels: Seizing the Moment and my appearance on One on One to discuss how the piece was made.

Some‘s Steve Caporizzo a big thank you for that.All the performers did a great job. Our friends from the Back 40 Band did a good job at getting the crowd warmed up. I think most of us on the air staff took pictures, which you’ll see on the WGNA website, as everyone slowly recovers from a long, enjoyable day. (Please check back often)
In my gallery, I also took a few photos while I was on stage of some of the performers, and a few of the audience, which some of you even posed for. My wife, Linda, walked with me through the fest goers, and took some more pictures. Maybe you’ll see yourself or some of your friends.

I used to have a guilty pleasure. Red Robin serves a Chicken Caesar wrap that is sooooo good. I am sure horrible for me and loaded with a lot of stuff my body doesn't need, including gluten. Since I don't really eat out anymore, I had to re-create this dish so I can still have it. This dish was 100% a success. It tastes the same! If you love Caesar Salad, then you are really going to love this wrap!
For this recipe you are going to need gluten free flour tortillas. I use the rice flour tortillas from Trader Joe's, or I make my own.Gluten Free Chicken Caesar Wrap
adapted from Six Sisters Stuff
2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts
2 cups water
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp salt

On Monday, Ford’s motorsports division announced it would not field a factory team in the 2013 World Rally Championship, becoming the second manufacturer to abandon the series in the last week.
The withdrawals of Ford and BMW Group’s Mini brand are yet another manifestation of the dual crises of overcapacity and low sales in Europe, and a reminder that motorsports programs are among the first to go when budgets are reined in.
Though Ford and Mini said they would withdraw financial support for factory teams, both manufacturers have pledged continued support for privateers. M-Sport, which has won 52 races in 225 starts since partnering with Ford Racing in 1997, said it would continue to campaign the Fiesta W.R.C. in 2013, and Ford said it would aid in the continued development of the racecar. BMW Group, meanwhile, said it would refine the 1.6-liter engine of its Countryman-based W.R.C. car and supply Prodrive, its initial partner when it joined the W.R.C. in 2011, with parts. Prodrive has reaffirmed its commitment to the Countryman W.R.C. platform for 2013 and beyond.
The W.R.C., in which the success of the driver and co-pilot is contingent on final time, not wheel-to-wheel racing, is facing a broader crisis. Nokia, the Finland-based telecommunications manufacturer, abandoned a multiyear, multiplatform sponsorship deal in May, citing its shifting financial priorities. And for motorsports enthusiasts fond of power slides and skids, who previously looked to the W.R.C., there are young series like Formula Drift and Global RallyCross to hold their attention.
W.R.C. has historically not been as personality-driven as Formula One, Nascar or IndyCar, but the series may nevertheless feel a star-power vacuum in 2013. Sébastien Loeb, who secured his ninth W.R.C. title this month, the most of any driver, said he would run an abbreviated race schedule after 2012 to focus on his second career in the World Touring Car Championship.
Jari-Matti Latvala, a Ford works driver for five years who is ranked third in the 2012 championship, signed this week with Volkswagen for the 2013 season.

I thought carefully before writing this, but this is a post that I feel I have to write.
A terrible thing happened on Saturday: a loving mother & father lost their little baby girl. Just 9 months old, she had just learnt to crawl & she died in her cot during the night.
I’ve never met Jennie nor her family but I feel as if I know them; I & hundreds of people all around the world who know her through social media & from her wonderful blog are grieving for her.
Like us she has boy-girl twins; they were born just a few months after ours. Hers was one of the first blogs I followed when I became a Dad, mostly because her family was similar to ours. Her twins were very premature, much earlier than Jake & Ellie, & had a terrible struggle in their first few months. They are now happy, healthy, adorable 2-year-olds. I’ve been able to learn from her, compare notes, share experiences.
It was more than that though. Jennie has a rare gift in her writing: she is wonderfully expressive, & always writes straight from the heart. I couldn’t help but be moved when reading her posts, to share in her struggles, her triumphs, her joys & her sorrows.
There has always been one thing that shone through more than anything else in her writing: Love. Her great love for her children; how she struggled to do all she could for them when they were in NICU for the first weeks of their lives, her joy at their coming home, her devotion to their well-being ever since.
Love oozes out of every word, shines from every photo, drips off every page.
Then in May last year – despite believing she was unable to conceive naturally- she gave birth to a baby girl, Matilda Mae.
On Sunday afternoon I read the saddest tweet I have ever seen: “Our beautiful daughter Matilda Mae was taken from us last night to join the angels in the sky x RIP Beautiful angel daughter x We love you x”
My initial reaction was one of utter disbelief. I’d not read of any health difficulties, she seemed a healthy, happy child: how could this be?!
But tragically it was true.
Yes, children die. Far too many. There are some wonderful representatives of the UK parent blogging community in Ghana right now trying to do something about that, a cause Jennie herself has championed. But when it’s someone you have come to know, to have shared in their life with its struggles & its triumphs, someone you feel has been a part of your life & that of your own family – it’s different. It hits home, hits hard.
We grieve for her & for her husband & children. I can’t imagine what they must be going through.
You feel so helpless. You just want to snap your fingers & make everything better, but you can’t. You want to do something that can make a difference, so you send inadequate words, warm thoughts, virtual hugs, positive vibes, prayers. Many of us have.
She still writes; in sharing her pain & remembering her beautiful daughter in some way I hope it is helping her through this. Her tweets since have been some of the most heart-breaking things I have ever seen.
“I cannot rest. I cannot make Esther and William understand and I wish someone would please tell me what I am supposed to do without MM. Am so full of milk. Just want to hold my baby and feed her. I will never forgive myself but somehow I have to make life good for the twins. No one I know understands why I would be online right now but where else is there to go? MM shared our room so we cannot go back in there. Her cot is still there with all her things. I keep expecting her to be here. Esther and William do not understand. When we tried to explain at breakfast they just asked for more shreddies. How do you tell 2.5 year olds that their baby sister is dead? We can’t remember how to be a family of 4. My breast are aching. I have to have medicine to stop my milk. I have frozen some to make a keepsake x”
Yet even in such grief she is still thinking of her young twins & being a loving Mother to them:
“I need to try and rest if not sleep. For Esther and William. I am so grateful for Twitter tonight. I am in a quiet dark house x…I have made lunch for everyone today and we made blue play dough to put fish in.”
And still she thinks of others & not herself!
“If you have just half a thought of doing something with your little one, do it today! All week I wanted to get in Matilda’s bath with her x…Please pls hold your children and kiss them all you can. Tell them you love them many times a day. You will never get a single second back”.
I & many others have been very moved by this, moved to greater closeness, love & appreciation for our own children & family. Even out of her darkness shines light, light from the love of Matilda Mae, ‘star of the sea’.
Although I’ve never met her & probably never will, Jennie seems to be the most loving, caring mother & just a lovely person. She doesn’t deserve this; let’s do what we can to help her & her family through this.
Send her some love, say a prayer, whatever you feel moved to do.
Rest in peace, Matilda Mae: may your star continue to shine.

UPDATE: I thought carefully about including this in my most viewed posts list. This was never about me or this blog, but about Jennie & Matilda Mae & family. The response to it however has been – by my standards at least – phenomenal. This is purely down to how Matilda Mae & her loving mother have touched the hearts of people all over the world and so I think it should be shown.
That is just beautiful x
It’s rare that a ‘news’ story affects me, you acknowledge that it’s tragic but that’s it. This however has really got to me, reading what had happened and her tweets has me in tears every time. It’s just so awful. I think the fact that she was the same age as Henry makes it really hit home.
What a beautiful post. I’ve had to read it several times through my tears,
xxx
A really thoughtful, beautiful and moving post. I was also very upset for her and her family when I read the tweets …. utterly devastating and shocking.
I’ve felt completely affected by this too, I’ve found it hard to focus on anything since hearing the news. Another family suffering intolerable torment – its just too hard to comprehend
Beautifully put and you have summed up how we as a community and as parents feel x
A beautiful post that brings tears to my eyes, if only we could turn back the clock
Just beautiful.
I too have never actually met jennie yet we chatted often. So often that i feel I know her. There are no words. It is not far. Xx
A beautifully written post that sums up the way a lot if us are feeling at the moment. My thoughts have constantly been with Jennie and her family since this heartbreaking news and, like many others, I really wish we could take the pain away for them.
RIP Matilda Mae xxxxx
There are no words. It is not fair.
My heart is with jennie, david and their family xxv
I know jennie from when the twins. We’re born as they were in the nicu like my son was xx
My heart goes out to Jennie. I pray she and her family find the strength that will get them through this. Life changes irrevocably after such a loss and I truly hope the love of her family and friends sees her through. You are a wonderful friend.
What a very special post, I have been reading Jennie’s blog this morning and I can’t get the horror of it from my mind. The tweets are even more harrowing. Every parent’s worst nightmare. Sometimes life is so unfair – words fail me.

This is absolutely beautifully written and so true. Jennie is being so strong and finding comfort from blogging and tweeting.
I cannot comprehend what on earth Jennie and her husband are going through right now. This is a truly beautiful tribute, thank you for writing it and sharing it with us x
This post is so so from the heart, and really shows the empathy that bloggers provoke in one another, in our very shared lives.
I hadn’t read any of what you quoted (apart from the original blog post on which I didn’t feel strong enough to comment on till tonight).
Thank you for the strength it must have taken to write this beautiful post which has moved me to tears.
I hope we can all help Jennie in some way, even if it is to only show her that she is not alone.
Liska xx

John Cardiel Interview - Roots WL90
Published in Whitelines Magazine Issue 90, Spring ’10
Words: Chris Moran
It’s fitting that this months’ roots interviewee should be the legendary skate/snow pro John Cardiel. Cardiel has had one of the longest and most respected board-riding careers ever. His attitude and vision marked him out from a super early age, joining the likes of Tony Hawk and Danny Way when he won Thrasher Magazine’s coveted ‘Skater of the Year’ contest before his twentieth birthday. As his childhood friend Toad claimed in a recent retrospective on John, “he was just instantly good on a board. He had more natural talent than he could contain.”
John ‘Card’ Cardiel was born in 1973 and raised in Half Moon Bay, California, right where the giant wave Mavericks breaks. “I never really got into surfing,” he says now. “I was just into skateboarding and skimboarding or riding BMX bikes. The surfer guys were all kind of dicks, they had this attitude that was so above it all, and I never got that crazy surfer attitude. I was like ‘fuck surfing’.”
Instead, John skated full time, going as far as to invent his own tricks and spending all his pent-up energy on local curbs and ramps. Then a chance meeting with the snow occurred. “My parents had gotten a job up at Grass Valley, kinda halfway between San Fransisco and Tahoe,” he says, “I was only the skater kid up there, but I met some older guys like [former Burton pro] Mike Jacobi, and they started to take me up snowboarding. It was basic, you know? I had Sorell boots and duct tape and it was just as the boards had gotten p-tex. So Mike had seen me do a backflip my first day – because from skating I was naturally there with the board – so he really flipped out on me and got me a Burton snowboard sent out. I was so stoked, and I entered some competitions and yeah, I got hooked up with Avalanche snowboards.”
John quickly caught the eye of another brand – Santa Cruz – and got a reputation as one to watch. Between 1992 and 1994 his star was on the rise, and his shared part with Steve Graham in 1994′s Riders on the Storm was a revelation. In just under two minutes he showed the world two tricks that became the most fashionable things to try in the mid 90s – the late backside 180 (there was no grab, but he boned his front leg out and stalled the spin until the last moment), and an incredible backflip 360 that was one of the most talked about moves of the year (my own VHS copy went all sketchy at that point because me and my friends had paused and rewound the tape so many times).
Strangely, at the time the snowboard world was mesmerized by this young kid with a baseball cap on backwards, Cardiel himself was getting disillusioned with snowboarding. In a recent documentary series on VBS.tv, he spelled it out: “Skateboarding was better. You think about it, [with snowboarding ] you’ve got to buy the boots, buy the snowboard, buy the clothes, buy the lift ticket. That’s two hundred bucks just to fucking go up to the snow. You’ve got to be semi ‘of means’ to even kick start the sport. Now you’re around all these dudes who are professional at it; like grew up in Aspen, whatever. Snowboarders. They don’t fucking know hard times. We don’t really vibe. With skateboarders, these are my people; I just fucking vibe with them.”
He’s not a confrontational person, but these are harsh words. I ask him if that’s why he gave up on the pro snowboard scene? “Snowboarding came fairly easy to me, [but] I found that some of the kids that were sponsored and other people in the industry, they were taking their snowboarding like it was like a skilled thing, and that they were on top of the world or something. And I was thinking, ‘But you can’t do these tricks on a skateboard. You’re doing them on snow and it’s soft, dude’. I mean I just thought skating was difficult, you know? And it wasn’t until I started seeing people like Craig Kelly riding, or people taking lines in Alaska, that I was like, ‘OK that’s the real shit’, but as far as tricks went, I just thought you guys had nothing on skaters.”
Snowboarding came fairly easy to me. As far as tricks went, I just thought you guys had nothing on skaters
Cardiel was hanging out with some of the original bad boys of the sport, whose hotel-destroying and state eviction antics were documented in the early films, so I’m surprised at this. I ask him if there were any snowboarders he did like hanging with. “Oh yeah,” he says. “I mean [Mike] Ranquet was a really good snowboarder and so was Chris Roach, Monty Roach and Tucker Fransen. These guys were all good, but they were a little bit older than I was, buying beers and so on, and they were just on a different level. I wasn’t really meshed in, I would only really see them out snowboarding, so it was more like when I saw the kids coming through at some of the sponsor competitions in my age group. I just didn’t get them. Now I’m older I see that it was just that I was young and I didn’t fit in. And my thought was: ‘If the people I like – if skateboarders could tap into this – it would be over.’ They were so much more talented.”
John quietly backed out of the competition scene, and then the media scene, appearing less in magazines and films, though he did turn up in the odd road movie such as 1996′s RPM made by Fall Line Films, which featured a section of John skating and snowboarding, blurring the tricks he could do on both boards. By 1996 his skate career was absorbing all his time. He literally changed skating, trying all his tricks out switch, or landing fakie, or putting late reverts on everything. And he did it all with what looked like an effortless style. Before Cardiel came around, skating had been getting super technical, with small wheels and cut down boards all the rage. After John, it looked pretty much as it does today; his influence can never be understated. I ask him whether throughout that time he ever went back to snowboarding. “Oh yeah, all the time,” he says. “I totally had my eye on the weather storms, I always had a four wheel drive car, and I always made the effort to go whenever I was home. I used to go riding with [former pro skater-turned snowboarder] Noah Salasnek, we would get up super early and go riding and get first tracks and just lap the chairlifts you know. I loved snowboarding, I loved the ride and the thrill of snowboarding, so I never gave it up.”
In 2003 John was in Australia filming for the skate movie Tent City when disaster struck. As he ran alongside a van, chatting to the guys inside, he was run over by its trailer, crushing his spine. “Next thing I know, I wake up in the hospital and can’t feel my legs,” he recalled in a recent interview. “I was tripping. I was trying to move them but couldn’t do it. I was thinking that maybe I had a spinal tap or something, like maybe they did something to me that made me unable to feel my legs. But then I see Matt Rodriguez and my dad and Julien Stranger, and they’re like, “Dude, you’re fucked up.” I was like, “Oh, shit. I really can’t feel my legs. This is real.”
The doctors told John he’d damaged his spinal cord so badly he’d never be able to walk again. But John didn’t believe the prognosis, and with super-human determination, he vowed to beat the paralysis. When he started to feel the odd sensation in a toe or two after six months of hospital, he knew there was hope. “Every day I’m trying,” he says. “It feels good to be able to walk to the bathroom, just to walk and stuff. It’s taken a hell of a struggle to get where I’m at. I haven’t noticed this one point, like, “I can walk now!” It’s just all part of it. Even now it’s such a struggle. I still can’t call it walking, necessarily.”
I watch the X-Games and that, and the pipes have gotten so much bigger it’s just unreal. I would just love to see one run where they just busted out a big mute, a big method, and some super-styled airs.
The VBS documentary shows John’s new passion – fixed gear bikes, and he races them around his home city of Sacramento, even getting air off a concrete bank at one point. I’d read in one interview that he had tried being back on a skateboard again, and I ask him if he’s thought about getting on a snowboard?
“I would love to give it a try,” he says, “but the frustration of not being able to do what you know you can do – that’s pretty difficult for me. I wanna bust you know? I wanna go hard, and if I can’t I’m gonna be really hurting. You know when you see bumps and jumps out of the corner of your eye, and if you can’t go and hit them you’re like, ‘what am I doing here?’ But saying that I will probably give it a try.”
I ask if he’s kept up with the snowboard scene in the interim? “Oh yeah,” says John. “I pick up the magazines, and I see what’s happening.” I wonder what he makes of the Olympics and the halfpipe scene, especially Shaun White’s recent double McTwist. “Well I watch the X-Games and that, and the pipes have gotten so much bigger it’s just unreal. I watch that shit and I’m like, ‘Wow!’ The thing that irritates me is that it’s all these flips and twists. You know, I would just love to see one run where they just busted out a big mute, a big method, and some super-styled airs. That’d be a trip.”
I’m with him on that one. It’s fitting that someone who’s remembered for being one of the most stylish riders to have ever stood on a board is even today looking at snowboarding with that aesthetic eye. We could do a lot worse than listen to John Cardiel, a true living legend.

The Global Vaccine Safety Initiative (GVSI)
Background
.
The Blueprint was developed through a worldwide consultation of experts who defined its mission, vision and goals.
The Global Vaccine Safety Initiative, or GVSI, was set up to implement the Blueprint strategy. This comprises a framework of eight strategic objectives aimed at enhancing global vaccine safety activities. The strategic objectives focus on building and supporting a systemic approach to vaccine pharmacovigilance in all low- and middle-income countries.
Blueprint objectives 1-4 relate directly to the components of vaccine pharmacovigilance. Blueprint objectives 5-8 cover supporting elements that must be in place for the vaccine safety system to function effectively. The GVSI was set up to provide WHO and partners with a sound framework to strengthen vaccine pharmacovigilance worldwide.

NoProRogue: Signs
Signs of Democracy
No Prorogue Rally: Guelph, Ontario
We held grassroots rallies and marches across this great land in heartfelt protest against Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s shameless premature prorogation which he effected solely to avoid government accountability to Canadian citizens.
On the 23rd day of January, 2010 Canadians of all ages and political affiliations (or none) took to the streets in peaceful assembly.
Coming from the earlier Waterloo Rally, I was late arriving in Downtown Guelph, but I got there in time to see the Rally transform into a March.
These are some of the signs I saw on the Guelph NoProrogue march that day.
The gods smiled on our just cause: it was a mild day, although winter in Canada. Canadians of all ages turned out to give voice to our concerns through peaceful assembly.
Is it any wonder that a great deal of the outrage centers around the fact that the premature prorogation means that our hundreds of members of Parliament will not be at work due to the premature proragation… yet they continue to receive their paychecks courtesy of Canadian tax dollars paid by ordinary Canadians. That’s us.
For most Canadians no work means no pay. So this sounds rather like a prorogation vacation to many Canadians.
It took me a minute to “get” the sign (right) until the lightbulb lit and I realized it was picturing a perogie. I don’t know about you but I can always use a good laugh. Leave it to Canadians, not only are we polite, but we’ve long been world leaders in the field of humour. I rather like perogie-prorogue pun.
But the point is that the Canadian tipping point was the attack on democracy.
Who says Canadians don’t wrap themselves in the flag? We may be flawlessly polite, comparatively quiet and incredibly law abiding, but we love our country. It was inspiring to see all the people wearing Canadian flags in one way or another that day.
And heartening to see so many hand made signs. A great deal of passion — and effort — went into this day.
With government like we’ve got, we can all surely use a smile
Is it any wonder that this song was running through my head while putting this collection together?
So although this hasn’t got anything to do with the grassroots NoProrogue movement, or Canada as far as I can tell, this video has some of the funniest signs I’ve seen in a long time… accompanied by the Tesla song “Signs”.

Yoga to strengthen & flatten abdominals, tone back, legs, hips, and more.
Posted by: Julie Lusk
This yoga sequence helps with abdominal core strength and tones the back while also lengthening the psoas muscles.
The psoas, deep and large, runs from the lumbar spine, stretches over the hip joint and under the abs, and attaches to inner thigh bone.
Traditional leg lifts, “crunches” and sit-ups are often done to strengthen and flatten the abdominal muscles. The problem is that they also tighten and shorten the psoas tipping the pelvis forward, pushing your belly out (yuk) and misalignment of the back.
A tight psoas contributes to back, hip and knee problems, indigestion, dysfunctional breathing, instability, and other problems.
This particular yoga sequence activates the psoas muscle in a progressive manner: first facing forward, to the side, and then turning.
Other beneficial yoga postures are the forearm plank and side plank (creates core stability and strength with a neutral psoas) and pigeon (stretches and releases the psoas).
Consult a qualified yoga professional for instructions and contraindications. As with all exercise, practice for your own benefits and at your own risk.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chemical maker DuPont
The company, which has the largest market value among U.S. chemical makers, plans to keep capital spending at around $1.8 billion in 2013 and is delaying some projects until it is clear what U.S. tax policy will be, Kullman said.
The company had planned to hike spending in the new year.
"We're not going to spend as much as we thought next year," she said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday.
"We've looked at every program and asked, 'Can we spend less money now and delay some programs six months?'"
Agriculture and nutrition projects may get more funding due to their growth potential, but there's some uncertainty in the automotive sector, where DuPont sells paints and plastics, she said.
"Consumers will hold back until the fiscal cliff is resolved," said Kullman, who has run the Wilmington, Delaware-based company since 2009.
"It's not about politics anymore," she said. "It's about the country. It's about reducing our debt. It's about making a viable economy long into the future."
Kullman said she personally is willing to pay higher U.S. federal income taxes to help avert the fiscal cliff, a package of spending cuts and tax hikes due to take effect in January unless Washington lawmakers agree on a budget deal.
Kullman's 2011 compensation package was worth $12.2 million.
"We understand there has to be a balanced equation. There has to be increased revenues and there has to be decreased spending," she said.
If there is only a partial deal, one that doesn't address spending and the U.S. federal debt, Kullman said it could reduce U.S. GDP growth by as much as one percentage point.
"The biggest concern is not that they don't avert the cliff, but that they put forward a plan and never execute, or don't execute in a way that addresses the debt," she said. "Because otherwise you're just going to run up against that debt ceiling constantly."
BUYBACK VS. DIVIDENDS
Late Tuesday, DuPont announced a $1 billion stock buyback and said 2012 profit should hit the high end of its forecast.
DuPont decided a buyback, rather than a one-time dividend, would be better for shareholders, Kullman said. The company pays a 32-cent quarterly dividend currently, one of the better yields available to investors.
Due to the "fiscal cliff" uncertainty, Wal-Mart
DuPont considered that approach, but decided against it, Kullman said.
"With the uncertainty that's out there, and with the tax law changes, we believe it better serves our shareholders to reduce our share count," she said. "Many of our shareholders are tax-exempt funds, so they don't pay tax on dividends."
NATURAL GAS EXPORTS
Kullman said
Asked if DuPont would support exports of natural gas, Kullman said, "I do think as a country we need to first and foremost make sure we have energy security ... If we have great excess reserves that we can monetize, that should be part of a consideration."
DuPont shares closed up 1.4 percent at $44.30 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

From WENN.com
The two actors were famed for their musclebound roles during their 1980s heyday but they were left mortified during their latest joint project when each pulled a calf muscle performing routine manoeuvres.
Stallone got the injury jumping off a ladder so he warned his pal to take care, prompting Schwarzenegger to decide to warm up first - but he then suffered the same ailment doing his stretching exercises.
The Terminator star tells British magazine Live, ""Sly pulled his calf. He said to me, 'Be careful jumping down from that ladder, Arnold.' I said, 'Thanks for telling me; I'm going to warm up first.' So the next morning I'm warming up and I pull my calf muscle.
""So now we're both injured and the doctor comes and has to give us both cortisone shots. It would never have happened 20 years ago. We were like two idiots standing there. It was pitiful.""
The incident was not the pair's first health woes - they underwent joint shoulder surgery last year (12) before starting work on The Tomb.

Washinton Examiner: Just before 6:00 Monday night, Occupy D.C. protesters at McPherson Square gathered for their nightly general assembly… The protesters have agreed upon 16 guidelines. Guideline number 10 reads, “Don’t assume gender. When possible, go with gender-neutral pronouns.” To keep the noise level down, protesters use hand signals instead of vocal commands to demonstrate opinion. “Twinkle fingers,” performed by wiggling fingers at ear level, shows approval. Protesters agreed that the de-escalation committee would seek non-violent methods to protest. They requested that the committee be diverse and specifically discouraged too much participation by white heterosexual males. During the final session reserved for comments, discussions became somewhat heated when a man stood and said through the “human mic,” “We are all God’s children. We should not label each other.” Another man responded, “Issues of inequality should be at the center of discussions.” A woman added, “Don’t mention God. It makes me feel like I have to hide my agnostic beliefs.”
By 7:00 p.m. the meeting was adjourned, and protesters slowly dispersed. (LOL) (Emphasis & laughter mine)
Took these dipsh1ts an hour to wrap it up? What’s so complicated? For 99% of us (see what I just did?), if you have a c0ck and b@lls, you’re male. Vag and flume? You’re female. If you’re Chas Bono, you’re off Dancing With The Stars, because you’re horrible at dancing with stars. Boom, labeling done, meeting adjourned. Go. Home.

After the success of his album "Believe", Canadian singer Justin Bieber is now producing a new track for the upcoming album of his girlfriend singer Selena Gomez.
Justin wrote the lyrics of the song, whose title is not yet revealed, and he will produce it too.
The track will be featured in Selena's upcoming album set for release on 2013, in addition to other tracks by Toby Gad and Rock Mafia.
Its noteworthy that some critics suggested that the album may contain confessions about Selena's relation with Bieber like her previous single "Love You Like A Love Song".
Do you think Robert Pattinson should forgive Kristen Stewart for cheating on him?

If you're running Apache 1.3 (or an httpd based on Apache 1.3, such as OpenBSD's httpd), it's still possible to get MoinMoin working under WSGI. It will take some additional steps. These instructions assume you have root (superuser) privileges on the wiki server, and a dedicated virtual host name that you will use for your wiki (e.g. mywiki.your.domain).
Before we start, you should take note of your wiki directory (something like /var/www/moin/mywiki) and your wiki user (something like www or www-data -- whatever account owns the wiki directory and its content).
Install CherryPy on the wiki server.
Copy moin.wsgi from the wiki/server/ subdirectory of the source tree into your wiki directory. Edit it:
1 #!/usr/bin/env python 2 # -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*- 3 """ 4 MoinMoin - mod_wsgi driver script 5 ... 6 """ 7 8 from MoinMoin.server.server_wsgi import WsgiConfig, moinmoinApp 9 from cherrypy.wsgiserver import CherryPyWSGIServer, WSGIPathInfoDispatcher 10 11 class Config(WsgiConfig): 12 pass 13 14 config = Config() 15 16 application = moinmoinApp 17 18 def run_cherrypy(app, address='', port=8080): 19 from cherrypy import wsgiserver 20 d = WSGIPathInfoDispatcher({'/': app}) 21 server = CherryPyWSGIServer((address, port), d, 22 server_name='mywiki.your.domain') 23 try: 24 server.start() 25 except KeyboardInterrupt: 26 server.stop() 27 28 run_cherrypy(application, '0.0.0.0', 8080)
Change the server_name= part and the port number, if you want. You may use any port number greater than 1023 that's not already being used by something else. (We'll be running this program as an unprivileged user, so we can't use ports under 1024.) Give it execute permissions with a chmod 755 moin.wsgi command.
Arrange for the moin.wsgi program to be run as your wiki user, inside the wiki directory, according to whatever techniques you use on your system for boot scripts or the like. Start it running now. You should see it listening on port 8080 (or whatever you set in the moin.wsgi file).
Edit your Apache configuration (httpd.conf or whatever filename is correct for your system):
... Alias /moin_static183/ "/usr/local/share/moin/htdocs/" ... NameVirtualHost *:80 ... <VirtualHost *:80> ServerName mywiki.your.domain ServerAdmin your@email.address RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/moin_static.../ RewriteRule ^/(.*) [P] ProxyRequests Off ProxyPassReverse / ErrorLog /var/www/logs/mywiki.your.domain-error.log CustomLog /var/www/logs/mywiki.your.domain-access.log combined </VirtualHost>
Obviously, you should change the htdocs location, the port number, and the logfile locations as necessary.
The moin_static183 in the Alias should be changed for each version of MoinMoin. The moin_static... part in the RewriteCond is a regular expression, so it will match every version, and doesn't need adjustment. The purpose of the rewriting code here is to allow the Alias to work for the static content URLs, and rewrite (proxy) everything else to the CherryPy service. Reload or restart your Apache so that it picks up the changes.
That's basically all. Your wiki should be visible at now. Test everything and make sure it seems correct.

- p1. Laminin is a protein that bonds living cells together.

- p3. The cross is the symbol of Christianity.
- c1. Laminin's shape is the signature or hallmark of an intelligent designer
- c2. That designer is the Christian god.
Counter arguments.
Cherry picking
Laminin is not the only protein or cell found in animal connective tissues. None of the others (nor their structural illustrations) can be said to be shaped like a cross.
As noted above, laminin is only found in animals. Is it being suggested that another entity designed the plants?
Graven image
A common criticism of Christianity is that it breaks the second commandment (of the Biblical Ten Commandments) by the use of the cross or crucifix as a symbol of worship. If this is an accurate criticism, then the Christian god is encouraging the breaking of its own commandments. and photo of laminin as found in nature
- [2] - Youtube clip of Giglio making the laminin argument
- A lame argument about laminin A good rebuttal
- Many other molecules have shapes that can be seen or imagined as special in many different religions.

He was educated in catholic schools, being the most important the Instituto Miguel León Prado which awaken his curiousity about religion and beliefs.
During his childhood, he got involved in a Catholic church, getting even to do as an acolyte. Later, he joined a Krishna community for several years, becoming a vegetarian for over 5 years.
Later at University, his curiosity about religions and beliefs continue to growing bigger. At that time, considering his better capabilities for using reason and to question matters (you don't grow old in vane), he realized he didn't need any religions in his life, in particular after the 11S events occured, so he defined himself as an agnostic, later when he discovers The Atheist Experience show, he adds to his questions the belief in God, eventually becoming an atheist.
He's an Informatic and Computer Engineer from the Universidad de Santiago de Chile currently working as a Software Developer at a middle size IT company in Santiago de Chile.

VTOL Pad
From Mechwarrior Living Legends Wiki
The VTOL pad is the place where VTOLs can be bought, repaired and rearmed.
They consist of 2 landing pads where newly built VTOLs will spawn and where VTOLs can be repaired and rearmed, and a tower between those, where Battle Armor Weapons and VTOLs can be purchased.
They are often combined with a ASF Hangar to form a single big airfield.

If you think your freeform project might be somehow misconfigured - for example, IDE functions such as code completion or Find Usages are not working - one diagnostic tool you can use is the NetBeans Project Metadata Inspector module, available on the Plugin Portal update center. After installing, right-click a project node and select Inspect Project Metadata. You will see a dump in the Output Window of all kinds of relevant information. Pay attention to classpaths and associated sources in particular. You can also make a similar regular Java project, inspect its metadata, and compare the results.
If you believe there is a problem in the IDE and you need to file a bug report, the output of this module can be helpful, but there is no substitute for a complete, self-contained, reproducible test case; see DevFaqFileBug.

Fort Edmonton Park is Canada's largest living historic park, and one of Edmonton's premier tourist attractions. Located in the middle of Edmonton, this reconstructed fort lies five kilometers upstream from its original location, representing it as it stood in 1846.
The Fort Edmonton Park represents four distinct time periods, exploring Edmonton's development from a fur trade post in the vast Northwest, to a booming metropolitan center after the First World War.
The park features over 75 structures, many of which are the originals. Costumed interpreters operate the site and live the way of the past. Visitors enjoy exploring each building and each room, and talking to the role-playing interpreters.
The price of admission includes free steam engine train and streetcar rides, and period rides such as wagon, stagecoach, pony and buggy are also available with a small charge.
Enjoy special events at this venue on occasion like Canada Day (July 1, Canada's independence celebrations) that compare to none across

[edit] Location
The geohash is located directly in Berne.
[edit] Participants
[edit] The Expedition
[edit] TheOneRing
The geohash was only 5.9km from my flat, as the bird flies, so I decided that is was the perfect opportunity to get the Walk geohash. The total distance was just a bit more (6.5km).
I was not expecting what I saw when I arrived at the geohash: a wonderful marker drawn on the street. Thanks the other team for that. Unfortunately they left before I arrived and we didn't met.
While I waited 4pm to come, Crox arrived by bike. We haven't met each other before and it was great because of the Saturday meetup. Together we waited talking until 4 o'clock, but the other team didn't show up again. After a while we said goodbye and I walked back home. On the way it drizzled from time to time, but way too less to complain about. In contrary, it was quite convenient in the hot and humid conditions.
[edit] Arches, Swissbite, Fredy, Kei, Nemeova, Rahel
Our geohashing trip was planned long ago. Well, not much regarding any details, but we all made sure to keep the day free for a geohashing adventure. The day before our trip, in the evening, when the hash points were known, we got together for a phone conference to discuss and plan the details of our trip.
During our phone conference, we saw that the hash of the Bern graticule fell right into the city of Bern. Now for some of us, this was way too easy to reach, leading to the (in hindsight, unfortunate - more on that later) consensus do a multihash, going to Bern in the morning, and from there head off to the hash in the graticule of Basel in an attempt to reach at/before the designated hour for meet-ups.
So on 2011-08-06, all of us (well, except those fortunate ones living in Bern) took a train to Bern, meeting there at 11 o'clock. Obviously, as it always is when you plan something, this did not work out, because Nemeova and Arches were arriving later. Nemeova's excuse was that her a public transport subscription that was beyond its validity date (and because it was not her but the conductor noticing this, she was also handed a hefty fine) and the renewal took what seemed like an eternity, making her miss her train, whereas Arches was just late so that Nemeova didn’t have to travel to Bern all alone.
After waiting ages for the tardy ones to arrive, we were off to buy some chalk. This was crucial, as we wanted to leave a great non-permanent mark at the hash. From Google-Maps and our local insiders, we already knew that the hash was on a road in a residential quarter, so we agreed that chalk was perfect. While shopping for chalk, a cute yellow ball with a StupidGrin™ printed on caught Nemeova's attention, which she obviously had to buy, thereby providing us with a hashscot.
After our shopping spree, Swissbite, Rahel and Fredy, our local hashers, started arguing about which bus we should take to get closest to the hash, nearly leading to a breakup in its course. Flurry, Nemeova and Kei used this time to buy their bus tickets, and after the argument was over, we all boarded a bus (the same one, even) which brought us pretty close to the hash, with only about 5 minutes of walking at a slow pace left.
Once we arrived, we quibbled over who’d get which color of chalk, and then started drawing a marvellous piece of art on the street. We were observed by some resident children, but they were too shy to approach us or do more than peeking at what we were doing from behind the hedge separating the road from their house. They did ask their parents what "those big guys are doing with the chalk on the road". It was quite cute, actually :-) We heard no response from the parents, though, and we continued our drawing, which was going to cause marvel and wonder later on, and neither a police patrol nor private cars could stop us (well, they caused a short break, as we had to clear the road for them, but that doesn’t count, does it?).
After finishing our marker and taking the mandatory StupidGrin™ pictures, we were off for lunch in Bern. Unfortunately we couldn't wait for Crox and TheOneRing to arrive because we had to get to our second hash in France.

Paul McNultyTalk0
this wiki
Paul McNulty was the Deputy Attorney General for the Greatest Attorney General Ever, and a loyal supporter of The Greatest President Ever.
In May, 2007, he quit working for The Greatest Administration Ever to spend more time with his family.
During a press conference to explain his feelings about Mr. McNulty leaving to spend more time with his family, Mr. Gonzales admitted that McNulty was single-handedly responsible for the U.S. attorney firings scandal. And his resignation completely removes any cloud which may have been hanging over the head of Alberto Gonzales.
In factiness, during testimony before Congress, Mr. Gonzales wished that Mr. McNulty was more involved, which in no way means that Mr. Gonzales lied either time, but that both instances were true.
Mr. Gonzales wished Mr. McNulty was more involved in the firings and Mr. McNulty was single-handedly responsible for the U.S. attorney firings.

On the Heels of the RSA SecurID Recall
Posted by jcasaretto in Security, Wikibon on June 13, 2011
A recently announced recall of RSA’s SecurID product is causing waves across the industry. Navigating these events and considering the implications, we review some of the aspects and analyze where the industry stands in relation to these conditions.
Breaches
The details on the various federal contractor breaches have continued to emerge in recent news. Anofficial recent announcement from RSA acknowledged the previously rumored link between the initial RSA incident to the Lockheed Martin intrusion. L-3 and Northrop Grumman are likely to have been attacked through the same vector. This alarming series of breaches has caught the attention of media and customers alike. Among other sources, China has been mentioned as a possible source for these attacks. Meanwhile, reports of major defense contractors replacing RSA SecurID tokens with other token technology have been seen.
Conclusions from Federal, RSA hacks
Posted by jcasaretto in Security on June 2, 2011
The recent eruption of reporting on federal contractor organizations and recent compromises has certainly been alarming. As a result of this there have been a number of theories and conspiracies coming forward. At the root of these theories is a commonality derived from the RSA compromise where it is believed that the cryptographic keys for SecurID may have been taken. What these events mean to the enterprise however remains to be seen. With absolute certainty, federal institutions and their affiliates will be on watch for continued attacks, and if indeed RSA related, we can be sure that they are addressing deficiencies by all technological means possible.

Emulex’s strategic direction is to help IT shops provide additional data protection and privacy by encrypting data at the source – in the host server. There has been plenty of news about data breaches and literally millions of data records at risk, and some of the laws requiring public disclosure of data breaches. More recently, some states within the USA have passed laws requiring encryption for transmission or storage of personally identifiable information outside of a secure system. CIOs can no longer debate about whether to encrypt. Encryption is no longer an option, but a requirement.

THE near-total destruction of Baghdad's city zoo over the course of the 2003 invasion of Iraq was, in retrospect, a grim portent of the poor planning and disastrous mismanagement that would characterize the early years of the Iraq war. The zoo had been the largest in the Middle East before the invasion, with more than 650 animals; eight days after coalition troops arrived in the city, however, all but 35 were dead. "All the Americans would've had to do is drop off 50 men, with a few vets and a truckload of food, and they wouldn't have lost any of the animals," Lawrence Anthony, a South Africa conservationist who salvaged what was left of the zoo after the invasion, told me last year.
So it's heartening to read a February 2008 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, signed by embassy staffer Greg D'Elia and released by WikiLeaks over the weekend, detailing the Baghdad zoo's resurgence as "reportedly … the most popular destination for family outings in Baghdad." As of late 2007, security in the city was still dicey enough that most of the zoo's visitors came from the immediately surrounding neighborhoods. But as the worst of the brutal sectarian violence of the preceding years ebbed, some 8,000 Baghdadis were visiting each weekend, and the zookeepers could boast of some one-of-a-kind acquisitions:
[T]he Baghdad Zoo staff took particular pleasure in reclaiming for the Iraqi public the exotic animals formerly possessed by Saddam Hussein and his family. Uday's pampered cheetah is now tame enough for visitors to pet. Two of Saddam's three lions gave birth last year to three cubs each; now the Zoo has nine lions on display. The Zoo also has in its possession Saddam Hussein's former stallion, Al Abor -- "the most famous horse in Iraq," according to Mousa. Saddam Hussein rode Al Abor in countless parades and public ceremonies.
The best part of the cable is its account of the zoo's "highlights and lowlights":
The Baghdad Zoo also featured some primitive practices, including the daily slaughter of two donkeys to feed the lions, and some modern flourishes, such as exotic fish with an image of the Iraqi flag lasered permanently into their scales. (NOTE: These fish sport the old Iraqi flag. Zoo staff could not predict whether they will employ laser surgery to amend these now-outlawed, swimming flags. END NOTE.)
Then there are the alcoholic bears:
To ease the trauma of the brown bears' move from Saddam Hussein's possession into the Zoo, staff reportedly plied them with copious amounts of Arak; visitors repeated rumors that the disheveled bears continue to imbibe this powerful drink.

WikiLeaks seems to have rediscovered the news cycle, releasing seven cables from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo as the Egyptian government crackdown on protesters and journalists turned ugly Thursday. There's not much in them that you didn't know if you've ever read a Human Rights Watch report on Egypt, though a 2009 scene-setter for a visit by FBI Director Robert Mueller does effectively sum up the sorry state of human rights and civil liberties in Hosni Mubarak's country:
Egypt's police and domestic security services continue to be dogged by persistent, credible allegations of abuse of detainees. Police brutality in Egypt against common criminals is routine and pervasive, resulting from poor training and understaff. The GOE [government of Egypt] has not yet made a serious effort to transform the police from an instrument of regime power into a public service institution, but there are indications that the government is allowing the courts increased independence to adjudicate some police brutality cases.

It's been a while since WikiLeaked checked in on Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's newly embattled president and a reliably interesting character in the WikiLeaks oeuvre. Most of what we've seen from Saleh in the leaked U.S. State Department cables has followed a pattern in which U.S. diplomats try to coax more counterterrorism cooperation out of the veteran strongman, while Saleh -- whose government received $155 million in military aid from the United States in 2010, twice the previous year's amount -- tries to finagle more cash and materiel out of the Americans. A newly released December 2004 State Department cable recounting a meeting between Saleh and U.S. Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski (pictured above with Saleh in a 2007 photo) is no exception.
The meeting takes place a little more than a month after U.S. President George W. Bush's reelection; Saleh badly wants to meet with Bush in Washington to congratulate him personally, he tells Krajeski, and also talk about "important new developments in the region 'that can only be discussed face to face,'" according to the cable. Krajeski hems and haws a bit about this, at which point, the cable notes, "True to form, Saleh launched into a list of what he believes the U.S. owes him. 'Where is the money for the Army, and what about my spare (F-5) parts?' Saleh demanded." (The cable notes, a little acidly, that there have been reported problems with getting the Yemeni Ministry of Defense "to follow through with the necessary paperwork on parts and equipment in order to spend the 17 million USD in Yemen's [foreign military financing] account.")
There's also the matter of smaller weapons, specifically the massive number of small arms being bought and sold in Yemen:
Pointing out that any meetings with senior U.S. officials would quickly turn to the subject of Yemen's huge grey market in SA/LW [small arms/light weapons], insisting that he was already "cracking down" on the SA/LWs market.
The conversation soon turns, inevitably, to counterterrorism, in which Saleh has been a longstanding if not unproblematic partner to the United States. Pressed on the subject of Hadi Dulqum, an arms dealer with alleged links to Al Qaeda, the cable reports [U.S. government] agrees with the Saudis, said Ambassador, adding that Dulqum's connections with AQ are too extensive for him to be simply another Yemeni arms dealer.
Months later, Saleh does manage to swing a White House invite, prompting a June 2005 cable from the Sanaa embassy titled PRIORITIES FOR WASHINGTON VISIT: SALEH NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. The cable characterizes relations with Saleh's government as "frustrating and difficult," noting that "Saleh has indicated to top advisors in the past that he believes he can pull the wool over the eyes of the [U.S. government.]" On the political front, "Saleh touts Yemen as a leader in regional reform and has committed to democratization," the cable says. "Domestically, however, he has run-out of reforms he can implement at no political cost to himself."
The cable proposes "a public show of support via a greater role in public fora such as the G-8" as a possible inducement to greater democratization, but it seems that half a decade later, the upheavals in Tunisia and Egypt may have done the job more effectively.

On Thursday, Julian Assange told reporters that WikiLeaks would be releasing State Department cables concerning the assassination of Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January, and he has made good on the promise with a couple of short dispatches from the U.S. embassy in Abu Dhabi. They don't offer any more insight into the still-unsolved killing, but they do paint a picture of the diplomatic conundrum the incident posed for the United Emirates and the United States..
The story was first reported 10 days later by Reuters, and as it happened, U.S. Ambassador Richard Olson was at a social event with UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed when it broke, according to one of the two embassy cables, signed by Olson. An unnamed UAE media advisor, Olson reports in the Jan. 31 cable, ."
The UAE was no friend of Hamas -- the emirate's discontent with Hamas patron Iran is a recurring theme in the WikiLeaks corpus -- but its government was, of course, not exactly eager to be seen as enabling an Israeli incursion on the sovereignty of an Arab state, either. The cable describes the UAE officials' reasoning, and decision:.
American officials had their own decision to make about where their loyalties were -- one documented in the second cable, signed by Olson deputy Doug Greene, several weeks later. Greene reports that UAE officials requested the embassy's help in acquiring account data for credit cards, issued by a bank in Iowa, that investigators had linked to suspects in the assassination. The request was apparently turned down, and as Haaretz reports, the State Department denied at the time that any requests had been made. "By not accepting the request," Haaretz's Yossi Melman writes, "the Obama administration harmed the Dubai investigation efforts and assisted Israel instead." The U.S. government did eventually assist in the investigation, however, identifying American companies that may have been used to finance the operation.

That's the backstory to a series of U.S. State Department cables the Guardian is reporting on (but hasn't released) this morning, which allege that Queen Sirikit, Bhumibol's wife, had a hand in the 2006 coup. Samak Sundaravej, who briefly served as prime minister during the chaotic post-coup years, tells U.S. diplomats that Sirikit
was indirectly "responsible for the 2006 coup d'état." ....
The Guardian adds that "there is no mention in the cables of any coup involvement by King Bhumibol himself," but that they do report that shortly after the coup, "Bhumibol called the leaders of the coup to his palace for a meeting the evening after Thaksin was ousted and was 'happy, smiling throughout.'"
Speculation that North Korea is aiding the Burmese junta in its aspiring nuclear program have been around for years, at least since the Far Eastern Economic Review first published an investigation on the subject in November 2003. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton publicly fretted about North Korean involvement in July 2009, and the U.N. security council accused the Hermit Kingdom of shipping centrifuge components to the Burmese junta via a series of shell companies in a report last month.
These reports range from speculation to informed speculation, and the cables from the U.S. embassy in Rangoon released by WikiLeaks yesterday aren't qualitatively different, though they add a few new intriguing data points.
In January 2004, an "expatriate businessman" told the embassy that he had heard rumors of a nuclear facility under construction in Magway Division along the Irawaddy River, and reported other suspicious goings-on: barges traveling up the river with building materials of a size too large for any of the industrial development projects in the area, a new airport with a landing strip so wide, the informant said, that "you could land the space shuttle on it."
The following August, an informant told the embassy that "some 300 North Koreans" were in the same area, assembling missiles and building an underground facility at a secret construction site. The author of the State Department cable seems skeptical, both about the storyteller and the story ("the number of North Koreans supposedly working at this site strikes us as improbably high"), but notes that this "second-hand account of North Korean involvement with missile assembly and military construction in Magway Division generally tracks with other information Embassy Rangoon and others hve reported in various channels."
North Korea has generally been suspected of helping Burma with its ballistic missile efforts, but not necessarily the actual nuclear program. So it's notable that this August 2009 cable reports a conversation with Australian Ambassador to Burma Michelle Chan, who told the U.S. embassy that her contact in the Burmese government
told her the Burma-DPRK connection is not just about conventional weapons. There is a peaceful nuclear component intended to address Burma's chronic lack of electrical power generation. When Chan cited reports of a Burma-Russia agreement for development of a peaceful nuclear reactor, XXXXXXXXXXXX responded that the agreement with Russia is currently just for "software, training." The DPRK agreement is for "hardware." XXXXXXXXXXXX confirmed reports Burma's Army Chief of Staff (third highest ranking) General Thura Shwe Mann visited the DPRK last November. Asked why Thura Shwe Mann, XXXXXXXXXXXX responded, "Because he is in charge of all military activities." XXXXXXXXXXXX reportedly seemed surprised that the West might be concerned by a Burma-DPRK "peaceful" nuclear relationship. XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested that, after all, given sanctions, Burma really has "no other options" but to develop the relationship with North Korea.
A couple other somewhat less conclusive cables about Burma's nuclear activities are here and here. Speculation about what exactly the Burmese junta is up to has increased since a former army major went to a Burmese pro-democracy group with a mountain of inside information on the country's nuclear agenda. Democratic Voice of Burma's thorough debriefing of the major, Sai Thein Win, is still the most authoritative account of what's going on in the isolated country. For now, most of the rest -- including these new cables -- is difficult to definitively parse one way or the other.

One of the latest WikiLeaks scoops is that Royal Dutch/Shell managed to infiltrate employees into every important Nigerian ministry, and obtain regular inside intelligence on government doings, as my colleague Beth Dickinson wrote late last night. My question is, if Shell is so capable and has Nigeria so well wired, why does it continue to be the main target of attack by local militants?
This is a company that three weeks ago yet again declared force majeure to protect itself against lawsuits for non-delivery of some 125,000 barrels a day of oil because of militant attacks on its pipeline network in the country. It could take until next month to repair the Escravos-Warri pipeline, the company says.
All in all, Shell produced 629,000 barrels of oil a day last year, which sounds like a lot until you consider that its facilities are capable of producing more than 1 million barrels a day. Much of that difference is accounted for by massive attacks on its installations. In 2008, Shell also had a bad year, with militants attacking and shutting down its flagship 200,000-barrel-a day Bonga oil platform. Two years before that, Shell threatened to pull out of the Niger Delta entirely after a spate of attacks on its installations resulted in numerous deaths and kidnappings.
This is not meant to be snarky. But is the Nigerian government all that important in this case? Given the stakes, one does wonder if Shell is putting as much effort into infiltrating the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, the group responsible for much of the mayhem. A five-year-old story by Michael Peel, the Financial Times' former Nigeria correspondent, reported that militants and others were stealing somewhere between 275,000 barrels a day and 685,000 barrels a day of oil from Shell and other pipelines, at the time worth between $1.5 billion and $4 billion a year. They were spending much of that money on weapons -- which in their business counts as reinvestment into future attacks.

WikiLeaks hasn't posted the cables yet, but the New York Times's Scott Shane has a piece out drawing from a forthcoming batch of Yemen dispatches, focusing on the United States' relationship with the wily Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's president of three decades.
Nothing in it is terribly surprising if you've read much about Saleh, whose attempts to capitalize on the American government's sudden interest in his country following last year's foiled Christmas Day bomb plot, which was hatched in Yemen, are notorious enough to have inspired a Saturday Night Live skit. Still, some of the best character studies in the cables thus far have been of the United States' inconvenient allies in the Middle East and the former Soviet Union -- rulers like Saleh, Azerbaijan's Ilham Aliyev, and Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev -- so the piece is definitely worth a read.
The WikiLeaks cables do add some interesting details to the story of Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, Saudi Arabia's intelligence chief, who has emerged since last year as an important player in counterterrorism efforts in Yemen. After al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula botched an assassination attempt on Nayef in August 2009, the Saudis, who share a sprawling border with Yemen, stepped up their cooperation with American intelligence agencies, and were instrumental in foiling AQAP's attempt to blow up two cargo planes over the United States last month. A May 2009 cable released earlier this week captures Nayef's growing sense of alarm even before the assassination attempt, in an account of a meeting between the prince and U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
Nayef tells Holbrooke, "We have a problem called Yemen." He says that Saleh's "vision of Yemen has shrunk to Sana'a," the capital city in the north, and the Yemeni president has lost what connections he had once had with the tribes that form the de facto government of Yemen's once independent and now tenuously controlled south. The Saudis, Nayef claims, have better relations with the southern tribes, and have taken matters into their own hands, financing development projects in the tribal regions that host AQAP in an effort to win Yemeni hearts and minds. I wonder how that's working out...

The latest dump of classified information stolen from the U.S. government is extraordinarily damaging to U.S. national security, but not in the way that WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, apparently intended. (If the summer leak was a gusher what does that make this latest round, a tsunami?)
Assange is a garden-variety anti-American who believes that the United States is a malevolent actor which engages in all sorts of shameful secret activities that, if revealed, would discredit all aspects of American power. Prior to earlier dumps of classified material, Assange claimed that the secret files would document massive war crimes by the United States. They did not.
Based on the depictions of the cables in the media (the New York Times coverage begins here, the Guardian coverage begins here, and Der Spiegel's coverage begins here, it appears the same thing is true for this latest batch. The media apparently found no instances of shameful behavior -- I am assuming that if they had done so, they would have led with those stories. Instead, the cables document that American diplomats have been doing what they are supposed to be doing: collecting information, reporting their opinions and insights back to headquarters, and trying to build international cooperation in pursuit of core American foreign-policy goals.
The cables document that diplomats often relay information that would be, well, undiplomatic to say publicly. Diplomats often get foreign interlocutors to be more candid when they believe their discussions will remain confidential. Diplomats also opine on a range of topics -- the limitations of current lines of U.S. policy or the weaknesses of allies -- that would compromise an administration's effectiveness if shared with a general audience, but not because the views were dishonorable, or indicated that the United States was engaged in reprehensible behavior.
Assange's damage to the United States is not in what he discovered about the past, but rather in the peril he has placed our diplomats, our friends and partners, and our policies in the future. The massive security breach has made every bilateral relationship more difficult and likely lowered the quality of diplomatic reporting. Will our interlocutors be as candid now that they have seen what happens? Ironically, Assange's attack on our diplomats has meant that our statecraft may be more dependent on cruder instruments of state power, especially brute force. (Elsewhere on FP, Dan Drezner reads the situation just as I do and notes one further likely result: an uptick in intelligence failures as the bureaucracy responds by stove piping information to prevent future espionage of this sort.)
If WikiLeaks had uncovered evidence of gross misdeeds, I suppose reasonable people could debate the balance of interests the dump might have served. Outlandish claims to the contrary notwithstanding, the leaks have done nothing of the sort. Instead, they have damaged the United States and in doing so achieved no higher purpose than the damage they have done. To fervent anti-Americans, weakening the United States is an end unto itself.
In wartime, we should expect enemies to seek to damage us in this way. How will President Obama respond to an enemy attack of this sort?

The new WikiLeaks documents show that Iran has been hunting for missile technology all over the world, seeking to buy gyroscopes, jet vanes and metals, and perhaps whole missiles from North Korea. But Iran also has experienced great difficulty building longer range missiles. Why? Some clues can be found in one of the most interesting documents just released, a briefing that Russian officials gave their American counterparts on Iran's progress, or lack of it.
A summary of the Dec. 22, 2009 meeting was marked "secret" but tumbled out on Sunday in the reams of memos released by WikiLeaks and major news organizations. Fourteen Russian and 15 U.S. government officials compared notes that day about missile threats from Iran and North Korea.
Judging by the summary, it was a lively back and forth, during which the Russians claimed the threat from Iran's missiles is not as great as some have predicted in the United States. The size and nature of the threat is important because it undergirds the U.S. plans for a multi-billion dollar ballistic missile defense system.
The Russians were prepared to talk "seriously" with the U.S. group, the summary says. Their message was Iran is struggling to lengthen the range of missiles that could carry heavy loads, such as a one-ton nuclear warhead, that might threaten the region or beyond. The Russians said their basic conclusion is that "Iran's ballistic missile program continues to be directed toward developing combat ready missiles to address regional concerns," not targets like the United States.
This was also the assessment made in May by the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
In the December meeting, there was a sharp disagreement about the U.S. claim that North Korea sold to Iran a batch of 19 missiles, known as the BM-25. The transfer was first reported publicly in 2006; the BM-25 missile is supposedly based on a Soviet naval ballistic missile design, the R-27, known in the West as the SS-N-6. This missile was first developed in the 1960s and later modernized; it was in service in the Soviet Union until 1988. Iran has not tested any of the missiles it imported. The U.S. officials speculated that Iran may have purchased it to reverse-engineer the technology (although North Korea has been known to ship parts, expertise and manufacturing facilities as well as the missiles themselves.) The U.S. officials said photos of the Iranian space launch rocket, the Safir, show an engine which looks like the one on the R-27, as well as fuel tanks and welds that resemble it. The U.S. officials said they had received "direct evidence" of the missile transfer from North Korea to Iran.
But the Russians strongly dismissed the BM-25 as a mirage, according to the summary. They said Iran would not have purchased an untested missile, and they doubted whether it even existed. "For Russia, the BM-25 is a mysterious missile," the summary says. "Russia does not think the BM-25 exists." They asked why North Korea would sell an untested missile; the Americans responded: for cash.
Both the Russians and Americans acknowledged the limitations of Iran's older, liquid-fueled missiles, based on the Soviet Scud and its modifications, including the Shahab-1, Shahab-2 and Shahab-3. Both sides also seemed to agree that the Safir is not a military threat because of the small size of the payload.
The key issue is Iran's pursuit of more modern and powerful solid-fuel missiles that could hit medium-range targets, such as those in the Middle East or Europe. Iran has been working on such a missile, called the Sajjil-2, which it has flight tested. (See my earlier post about it.) In the meeting, U.S. officials were more worried about this than the Russians, who said Iran continues to stumble with solid fuel technology. "In Russia's view, Iran appears to be having very serious problems with engine development," the summary says. U.S. officials countered that Iran has a decade of experience with short-range missiles using solid fuel, importing equipment from China, and could now extend it to larger missiles.
The Russians said Iran was a long way from building intercontinental ballistic missiles that could hit the United States. "Russia said its bottom line is that Iran lacks appropriate structural materials for long-range systems, such as high quality aluminum," the summary says. ."
At another point, the Russians said they think the North Koreans are working on a new, 100-ton capacity rocket engine using older technology, clustering the motors or stacking them. But Russia said the technology hasn't been actually spotted.

Ivory Coast toxic dumping report behind secret Guardian gag
From WikiLeaks
Tuesday October 13, 2009
Julian Assange (WikiLeaks investigations editor)
A confidential report releaed by WikiLeaks into the dumping of toxic waste along the Ivory Coast, has seen an extraordinary gag order served on the UK media. The order gags the press from reporting a parliamentry question and answer.
Here's the Guardian's David Leigh in an article first published on Monday night before hitting the front page on Tuesday:
-.
In effect, the communication between parliament and the people has been muzzled.
Here is the parliamentry question the Guardian can't tell you about (the Commons' member concerned, Paul Farrelly MP, was a former editor for the Guardian's sister newspaper the Observer):
- Ivory Coast dumping mentioned, by multi-national oil and commodities trader Trafigura, is possibly the most culpable environmental disaster since thousands were killed in the Bhopal chemical spill.
What this gags order aims at is preventing the mention of Trafigura and Minton in the same context. The Minton report was released by WikiLeaks on September 14, 2009. Despite this and some rock solid work by Guardian investigations editor David Leigh and other journalists on the boader Trafigura contamination, the Minton report released by WikiLeaks was not named in the UK press, nor were its contents report. Why? Because of the earlier secret 11 September 2009 media injuction against the report, as referred to by Paul Farrelly MP. To-date the UK public has been kept in the dark about the Minton report and its contents. Paul Farrelly's question is an attempt to take on the suppression issue. In the process it connected the Minton report on WikiLeaks to Trafigura, something the UK media has been secretly ordered not to do.
Statements made in parliament, including those of Paul Farrelly MP, traditionally enjoy an absolute exemption from molestation by the regular judiciary. Parliament does not, insomuch as it believes itself to be an expression of the national will, subordinate itself to any other court.
Knowing this, lawyers for Trafigura, Carter-Ruck, told the Guardian that the order covered reporting of Paul Farrelly MP's questions. That Carter Ruck felt this claim was makable is a bold and dangerous move towards the total privatization of censorship. Is a multi-billion pound commodities trader a truer expression of the national will than the House of Commons? The question is no longer rhetorical.
The Commons' gag and the September 11 gag are not the only issues. The London Independent has removed from its site, without explanation, its September 17 investigative article on the issue "Toxic shame: Thousands injured in African city". As for other papers, no one has any idea, because it is the habit now in the UK to secretly remove articles from newspaper archives and their indexes.

17 year old was arrested in Riviera Beach, Florida, for exposing 4 inches of boxer shorts, due to wearing loose fitting jeans, and spent the night in jail.
Now, I was raised at a time when, as a kid, I had to wear a collar and tie if we went to visit relatives, especially on a Sunday. I can clearly remember my father complaining when someone came into our local community club on a Sunday wearing jeans. However, having to dress up when going out with family members or having a club dress code is completely different to telling a citizen going about their business how they can and can’t dress.
Personally, I think the saggy jeans look untidy, slovenly, and well, crap. I also think that baseball caps worn backwards look stupid too. However, it should be everyone’s right to dress however they darn well please, as long as they are not exposing themselves.
Talking of which, it seems it’s OK for upskirt photographs of celebrities wearing NO underwear to be flashed (pun intended) around the world, but not OK to show underwear itself.
Oh, it’s not only the backwaters that are looking at such silly ideas either. Dallas, TX, and Atlanta, GA, are also considering similar proposals.
What’s next? No sunglasses after dark? No shirts carrying logos of foreign companies? Where does it end?

Keeping your kids safer online can be complicated, but Windows Live Family Safety helps make it easier for you. Family Safety provides a website
and a free program
that you install on the PCs your kids use, so you can give them some independence but still keep tabs on their computer activities.
Here are some of the ways Family Safety helps you keep your kids safer:
Web filtering—Control the categories of websites your kids can view, or specify individual sites they may or may not access. SafeSearch is turned on for popular search sites such as Bing, Yahoo!, and Google.
Activity reports—Get reports on your kids' computer use: the websites your kids have visited or tried to visit, time spent on computers, and the games and programs they've used.
Time restrictions—Limit the amount of time your kids use the computer, and specify the times of day they can use it.
Game restrictions—Limit the games your kids can play.
Program restrictions—Limit the programs your kids can run.
The different players in Family Safety and Windows make up a team that works together:
The Family Safety Filter. Software you install and set up on each computer your kids use. It monitors your kids using safety settings you select.
The Family Safety website. A central online location where you choose and manage all the settings for each family member and view their activity reports. You create settings on the website once and they apply to every computer you installed the Family Safety Filter on.
Windows Parental Controls. A feature in Windows that's turned on when you use Family Safety. You can use Windows Parental Controls to set up more safety settings for your kids' computers. For more information on setting up Windows Parental Controls and Family Safety, watch the
video about using Parental Controls.
When you set up Family Safety for the first time, you'll be asked to sign in with a parent or guardian's Microsoft account. This person will be the primary parent in Family Safety, and is the only family member who can remove the family from Family Safety. Be sure to use the Microsoft account of the parent or guardian you want to be the primary parent because you won't be able to change it later.
Here's how to set up the Family Safety Filter:
-or-
Go to the Family Safety download page, and then click Download. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install Family Safety.
Enter the Microsoft account email address and password of the parent you want to be the primary parent, and then click Sign in.
To set up the Family Safety Filter and to use the Family Safety website, you'll need a Microsoft account. If you don't have a Microsoft account, you can create one when you set up the Family Safety Filter. (A Microsoft account is an email address you use, along with your password, to sign in to Microsoft services such as Outlook.com, SkyDrive, and Xbox LIVE).
Select the check box next to the Windows account of each family member you want to monitor on that computer, and then click Next or Save.
If you want to monitor someone who doesn't have a Windows account, click Create a new Windows account, enter the person's name, and then click Create account.
Each member of your family should have their own Windows account and safety settings. If everyone in your family uses the same Windows account, you'll all use the same Family Safety settings. You won't be able to get reports of which website each child's looking at.
If you haven't used Family Safety before, you can skip this step. If you already use Family Safety, you'll see a screen where you need to match each Windows account to a name on the Family Safety members list. but be listed in the Family Safety members list as Ben Miller. By matching the accounts, you tell Family Safety that this is the same person.
If there's a Windows account on the computer for someone who hasn't used Family Safety before, you'll see them at the bottom of the list. When you click Add (person's name), Family Safety creates a new Family Safety membership for them with their Windows account name.
It's important that all of your Windows accounts have passwords. If you have an account without a password, your kids could log on to that account and bypass their Family Safety settings.
If the Windows accounts you're setting up to monitor don't have passwords, click Add passwords.
If you have guest accounts on your computer, you should turn them off because kids can also use them to bypass safety settings.
Click Next and you'll see the Windows accounts that Family Safety is now monitoring on the computer.
By setting up the Family Safety Filter, you've got a good start on protecting your kids. Going to the Family Safety website to tweak their settings gives you more control over web filtering and other settings. With the Family Safety Filter set up for the first time, your children will be monitored with Basic web filtering. This means that Family Safety only blocks adult content and anonymizer websites (websites that let kids view other websites anonymously so that Family Safety doesn't see their activity).
To make it harder for your kids to see the things you don't want them to see, you can go to the Family Safety website and change their settings, starting with the web filtering level. For younger kids, we recommend setting the web filtering level to Strict so that little ones can only see websites that are child-friendly.
On any computer, sign in to the Family Safety website with a parent's Microsoft account email address and password.
Under the name of the child you want to adjust settings for, click Edit settings.
On your child's settings page, you can see an overview of their current settings and choose what you want to adjust.
Busy parents don't always have time to surf the web and check out all the websites their kids might see. To make things easier, the Family Safety team reviews thousands of websites and assigns them to categories. The web filtering level you choose for your kids determines which of these categories they can view.
If you want to pick your own categories instead of using the preset levels, choose Custom. You'll see a list of all the categories, and then you can choose what's right for your kids. Under Web filtering, you can also make a list of blocked websites or allowed websites that will override the categories and filtering levels.
Click Web filtering, select Turn on web filtering, and then select a web filtering level:
Select Strict to block all websites that aren't child-friendly or on the Allow list (the list of websites that you've specifically allowed).
Select Custom to allow and block website categories manually. To allow a website category, select its check box. To block a website category, clear its check box.
Click Save.
If you want your child to use the Strict filtering level so they only see child-friendly websites, but you'd like to let them see a certain website that's blocked, you can add the website to their Allow list. Or, if you want to block a website that's allowed by their web filtering level, you can add it to their Block list.
Under Allow or block a website, type or paste the web address of the website that you want to allow or block.
Select an option from the list, and then click Add.
“The website I want to see is blocked!"
After you've set up Family Safety, when your child logs on to their Windows account to use the computer, and they try to go to a website that's blocked, they'll see a page like this:
If you're not available when your child is blocked from viewing a website, they can email you a request to see the blocked site. You can open the Family Safety website right from the email to approve or deny the request right away. Once you're done, let your child know if the website they wanted to see is now unblocked.
On any computer, sign in to the Family Safety website with your Microsoft account email address and password.
On the Family summary page, under Requests, click (number) requests.
To show any comments your child added, click the arrow next to the web address.
Click the arrow next to Select a response, and then click Approve for this account only, Approve for all accounts, or Deny.
When you're done responding to requests, click Save.
"What websites can I see?"
The Family Safety Kids' Sites website is a great place for young children to start on the web. The website has links to the most popular of the more than 8,000 websites Microsoft has categorized as child-friendly. There's also a Search these sites box where kids can search only those websites that are child-friendly instead of the whole Internet. To make it easier for your kids to find child-friendly websites, you can set your web browser's home page to the Family Safety Kids' Sites website..
To monitor what your kids are doing on their computers, turn on activity reporting. The Family Safety Filter will then keep track of what your kids do and save the information on the Family Safety website for you to look at.
On the Family summary page, click View activity report next to the name of the child you want to turn activity reporting on for.
Select Turn on activity monitoring.
After you've been using Family Safety for a while, Windows-update.
For more information about how to help protect yourself and your family online, see Online safety information for parents and kids. Check out the various links on that page, and share Internet safety tips and habits with your kids.

Wine Recommendation
Osprey's Dominion Vineyards2005 Vin Gris Rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon
(North Fork of Long Island)
My love of local rosé – especially this time of year – isn't news. I'm always ready to introduce non-believers to the delicious versatility that is dry rosé.
But, as with many wines in many regions, there is a seemingly endless array of styles of local rosé on Long Island. You've got your sweet, flabby versions that taste more like Koolaid than anything made with wine grapes. You've got fresh, clean, crisp wines that are just awesome on a hot summer day or with a picnic lunch. And of course there's everything in between too.
This rosé, made with Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, is a nice example of a drier style but I don't think it's bone dry. There might be some residual sugar here.
Ripe berry flavors come through on the nose, including sweet strawberries, raspberries and just a little bit of cherries. There is an almost-buttery note too that is really interesting – maybe the result of some malolactic fermentation. Fruity and a little more round on the mid-palate than many local bottlings, this rosé is medium bodied and has a similar flavor profile – with the addition of some watermelon and a minty note on the finish.
People have been telling me lately that good, fuller-bodied rosé can stand up to steak. I'm not sure about that, but if any rosé could, this might be the one. For me, it seems best served with spicy-sweet barbecued chicken.

As the newest print in our home suggests, we are so happy to be back in our home sweet sunshine state! In the two months since I have posted last, we have busy little bees: a cross country move, traveling, visiting with family, and tackling our first round of many makeover sessions for Miss Shania. In the next few days, I'll give you a virtual tour of the progress we've made on our home, so stick with me, I promise I'll finally get to it! All I can say is that we are loving being home owners and loving being in Jacksonville even more.
Since I'm not quite ready to take you on the tour yet, I thought I'd introduce you to the newest addition to our family and a related craft project!
First things first: We rescued another dog! His name is Rigby, and he's a chihuahua/ terrier mix. He's a year and a half old and weighs in at only 13 pounds. After a short two weeks, he's already part of the family and loves his new home. Rigby gets along great with Lucy, our four year old Australian cattle dog (Rigby and Lucy. Yep, we like The Beatles. Who doesn't?). He adores and protects Everett. He's quite the mama's boy. He's house trained, potty trained, and well behaved. And I'm happy on all accounts!
Here's a picture of Lucy and Rigby snuggling. They love to find sunny spots on the carpet together. I swear, this isn't posed. They're already best friends!
I have to say though, our home was already very well balanced before bringing home another dog, and I'd be lying if we said we weren't skeptical. Lucky for us, he's fantastic. I can't tell you how relieved we are that he's doing so well! Although, since he is already very protective of us and his new home, he is having some issues with the heavy foot traffic in our neighborhood. He's getting better, but his occasional discontempt for dog walkers and school children is nothing compared to how he feels, and sounds, when someone comes to the door. When Lucy joins in, it's definitely a nap and bed time ruiner for poor Everett (and poor mama). The other night when the UPS man rang the doorbell after bed time AGAIN, I thought maybe I could get crafty and help our new little fella out.
Here's where the new puppy related craft comes in! I decided that with all this barking, I wanted a message for our door. I wanted it to be cute and clever, but most importantly I wanted it to ward of unwelcome guests while Everett is sleeping. I also wanted it to be a subtle hint for the UPS and FedEx guys with their incredibly persistent knocking. So I came up with this: "Please don't knock or ring the doorbell. The dogs will bark and mama will bite." What do you think? Did I find a happy medium between: "beware of dog," and, "this house is protected by the good Lord and a gun?" I realize this officially makes us the least neighborly folks on the block, but heck, I don't care... I just hope it works!
Just right click, save, and print away. Of course, just don't pass it off as your own and we're alllllll goooood. =)
***UPDATE***
So I feel like the worlds biggest dummy. Not everyone in my boat has multiple dogs. Here's a new printable to correct that for all of you one-dog people! Enjoy!
If you have a cat that barks and wakes up your baby, I think you may have bigger problems, my friend...
Thanks for sticking with me. I'm so glad to be back and we really do have so much to catch up on! Stay tuned and I'll have all kinds of home updates, how to redecorate on the cheap, and even some carpentry projects. Get excited!
I'm excited! I think you and Andrew could teach Bo and I a few things...you guys are A.M.A.Z.I.N.G homemakers!
Awww, Thanks Ally!!!
Can't wait to see your house!
It took me a minute to realize it was you, Lauren!!! I'm excited to finally reveal our hard work!

Hello, My name is Mary. I find that when I feel very frustrated with others and that they are not “living up to the standards of Christ” God gently says to me…”I don’t want to talk about them, I want to talk about you…..you and me.” He asks me if I am sinnless so that I can cast stones. With bitter tears and anquish I cried out to God saying ” Men have cheatted on me, given me diseases that are incurable, beaten me, choked me, mentally abused me, held me hostage in cars, taken my only son from me, raped me, abandoned me in the street with nothing but the clothes on my back; after they coerced me into quiting my job to help raise their daughters that i loved as my own flesh and blood. They never even said they were sorry!!! They never cared for me at all…I was just a tool.” God’s response to me was “read 1Corinthians 13. Have you truely been loving by my standards. Have you been kind? Have you had no record of wrongs….” As I read the scripture I truely began to weep, for I saw the depth of my sin against God and man. I realized the issue was never what men were or weren’t doing for me. My real problem….was in fact always me.” Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your mind. this is the first and greatest commandment. The second is like unto it. Love your neighbor as yourself. This sums up the Law and the prophets.” I’ve stopped asking where all of the Christian men are. I just hope that God will help me be the woman I should be. I figure when God finds me loving enough he will send me the person he has for me. I’m just not ready yet…:)
many blessings to you in your walk with Christ.
I think it is fine to try and steer your kids in to these fields, but there is no guarantee they are going to have that bent. Also, there is no guarantee you will have 4 kids or any kids. I think it is fine to aspire to these kinds of plans, but ultimately God will direct your life and your kids’ lives.
My husband and I are both in math/technical fields. We have six children. Two show aptitude for math, two are disabled, two show aptitude in other things. Life doesn’t always turn out the way you plan/expect.
Just an little opinion — I don’t know a woman (godly or otherwise –especially one who has never had kids) who wouldn’t be intimidated by your whole ‘plan’. It sounds like micro-managing, and not a “we’re building this together”, more of a “this is what *I* want to do, are you on board” type of thing. Hardly welcoming words to a potential wife. From reading your posts, you seem to have good, Godly intentions, but perhaps need to soften your expectations to James 4:13-15. It’s good to have a big picture idea of how you want your life to go, but realize you may need to be flexible when God changes the details. Prov. 16:9
Keep up the good posts. I read this blog pretty often.
Good words.
“The reason why men work is so that they are the sole or primary breadwinners – so that they have the authority to make decisions and lead in the home.”
I would disagree that men have the authority to make decisions for the family BECAUSE they are the primary bread-winners. That would suggest that if a woman happens to make more money than her husband, she is therefore the head of the household. Yet a man can make less than his wife and still lead the family. Further, God has set up the family such that the man is to be the spiritual and moral leader, regardless of his paycheck.
So I would say that the man is to be the spiritual head of the household per God’s design. I believe a man should also, ideally, be the primary breadwinner. However, he need not think that if he makes less money he must therefore give up control to his wife. Making money does not make one a spiritual leader. However, a man who is leading his family will also be providing for them financially.
Hi Lindsey – thank you for the rather insightful reply.
Mind if I ask what OT/NT scripture do you have to support what you have written ?
Btw, you might want to take give the story of David & Abigail as well as the Levitical law of what the role of a husband is as well as a wife. Please feel free to reference NT as well.
Allow me to suggest that if a man is the spiritual leader – then the provider is G_D no matter what where the income / provision comes from.
In addition, the head/strength of Christ is the Father, the head/strength of the man is Christ, the head/strength of the woman is man, and the head/strengt of the children is the woman.
It is not about power nor inferiority nor inequality but about role, function, and order.

I agree that it’s about role and responsibilities, not power or inequality. I believe the Bible has given the role of the man as being the spiritual leader of the home. Thus, that is a role that God has set up, not simply a consequence of making the most money. If “money makes right,” then whoever makes the most money is the boss, whether that’s the man, the woman, or one of the kids. But that isn’t what God says about the family. God says that the woman is to submit to her husband, that husbands are to love their wives and lead their families, and that children are to obey their parents (Ephesians 5 & 6, Titus 2, etc). I see no caveat for when someone makes more money than the father.
One thing from Scripture that can shed some light on this topic is the Proverbs 31 Woman. She buys a field, plants a vineyard, and sells merchandise. Yet she does all this from home while running the household and so that her husband can become a leader in the community (he sits at the gate with the elders). We aren’t told who brings more income into the family…because it doesn’t matter. The roles wouldn’t change.
The point is that women can contribute to the family income, but the husband is still the leader of the home. The dollar amount that each brings in is irrelevant. It is the man’s responsibility to see that the family is provided for. Even if he currently makes less money, he should realize that if circumstances change and she can’t work, he must make ends meet because that is his duty. It just isn’t the woman’s reposibility to earn the income like it is for the man. It is the woman’s job to see to the running of the house and care for the children (especially young children). It’s not that a man can never do dishes or sweep the floors, but it isn’t his responsibility to make sure it gets done like it is the woman’s. If a woman can earn some money while still fulfilling her role, good for her. But her primary responsibility of running the house and caring for the children must come first.
One thing that often causes conflict in marriages is when the woman earns an income and believes that it therefore entitles her to usurp the role of her husband as leader. Realizing that money does not confer a right to lead is the first step to avoiding that problem. It is also useful to realize that husband and wife become one when they marry, meaning that there can be no “yours” and “mine” with their possessions. Whoever makes the money, it becomes both of theirs equally.
I think you have to add that you cannot marry Democrat women. It’s not enough that they are Christian. That really means nothing, since that could mean anything. As this election showed, they are incapable of thinking about their family, or the perspective of men. They overwhelmingly chose to back candidates that are statists. To marry one would be to undermine your family and everything you work for.
Wait till you see tomorrow’s 10 AM post. My meanest post yet against single women, based on exit polling data and what we know about Obama’s policies.
I’m intrigued. With your help, I’ll be able to alienate all my liberal friends.
It works for me! I have lots more free time to play Combat Mission: Battle for Normandy and Memoir 44.
Against all single women, or just those who think that their sex life is more important than the health of the nation?
Just the ones that think that their sex lives are more important than the nation AND the children.
You, sir, seem to have a knack for attracting the wrong type of women.
Like attracts like, wouldn’t you agree? The content in this post is throuroughly disgraceful to women, and puts Christian men to shame. Thank you for emphasizing the gospel of Christ, by the way. Since there was no mention of that, I assume that that is not a criteria for you: to have a Christian woman who has been washed and restored by the good news of Jesus. I promise you, you will know a God-fearing woman by her love and obedience to the Savior who died for her.
Also, God is glorified just as beautifully through dance, painting, writing, and working in a top law firm. It is not a matter of money and separation from a culture that is in desparate need of the gospel and Jesus, it is a matter of the saints’ hearts as they further God’s Kingdom via the gifts and abilities and talents that God has endowed to all His children.
THAT is what those women are most likely trying to articulate. It does not matter WHAT my children pursue, as long as they seek to glorify God, and run hard after Him with all of their hearts, minds, and strengths NO MATTER what those strengths may be.
Think on that.
Sincerely,
A Christian woman
I think that for many women, happiness and ease are more important than serving God effectively. My courting practices are designed to detect women who put their own happiness and ease above serving God effectively. I detect women who are informed and who want to do what works. The others I leave behind.
Your goals for your kids are wrong-headed. Simply pray and fast every day that you kids follow God’s path. Nothing more, nothing less.
What if God called one of your kids to be a missionary somewhere far away, who gets no name recognition, slaves with his family serving people far away and dies there to no publicity?
What if God wanted one of your children to be a prodigal? To serve as an example to his/her siblings? Only to find the true taste of grace later in life? And here is the rub … to serve as a rebuke to your “lawful” other children who haven’t tasted grace yet?
Yes, my courtship process is designed to detect people who hold your view so that I can reject them. I would not sacrifice $250,000 per child so that someone who wants to float aimlessly through life can play house using my money. That’s not what marriage is for. Marriage is to serve God, not the woman’s feelings.

This paragraph is strongly exaggerated. Women who tell you they don’t mind your daughter being a ballet dancer are simply saying that God can use all people in whatever profession they choose. They are not *denying* you anything except the right to make all the rules without their input. If you reread that paragraph through a woman’s eyes, you should see why it upsets my friends.
You come across as regarding any sort of differing opinion on your decisions as denying you the right to make those decisions. You seem to want to run a dictatorship. I don’t know any woman who would go for that. It’s scary.
I’ve only responded to the parts of the post that I’ve read.
“Women who tell you they don’t mind your daughter being a ballet dancer are simply saying that God can use all people in whatever profession they choose. ”
I think that this is a very popular view among Christian women – they are taught things like this by pastors and in Christian literature. And what I am saying is that I am not going to sacrifice half a million dollars on two kids who will be influenced by this viewpoint. My objective in courting women is to detect this view and then reject the person who holds it. And I do this because I want to serve God more, not less.
Anyone who says “God can use people equally no matter what they do” is immediately disqualified as a wife and mother, in much the same way as I would disqualify someone who supported abortion or gay marriage. They are unfit for the roles of wife and mother. They aren’t serious about making the marriage count for God, but instead are thinking of escaping from obligations and feeling happy. They want the marriage to serve the woman, and not God.
Watch your qualifiers, WK. I didn’t say that God can use all people *equally* regardless of their profession. I simply said that He can use them. So a child who is a ballet dancer is not automatically a waste. She might not lead as many people to Christ as Craig, but not every body can be the hands. She will be useful nonetheless.
I wouldn’t recommend the profession, but it is not the worst thing in the world if your daughter wants it.
The most important problem with your words is not your view of dancing, but the tone in whoch it is said. Remember, being a leader requires you to understand the views of the other person and care enough to allow them input in the decision making process.
I added that to be contrary, but I do apologize for doing so. I knew I was being mean when I did it, but I thought “it’s fun to be mean to Tracy, this will teach her a lesson”.
Anyway, here’s the deal. I am male. Being male means that you have a goal of making sure that your children can make their way in the world when you are gone and in the ground. I am looking for a wife who understands what men want for their children. Most Christian women are very impractical and emotional, and they do not recognize or respect this need/goal that men have. It is important for me, given the massive tax rates, government regulations on families and parenting, cost of raising a child, etc., that at least my wife thinks that my needs and values and leadership are important. Am I making sense here?
You’re making a lot of sense but I need one thing to be clarified. By “It is important for me… that at least my wife thinks that my needs and values and leadership are important.” do you mean that she accept unconditionally your plans for her and her children? What exactly would you accept as evidence of her regard for you?
Also, perhaps you should consider being less assertive about your plans. Like I said before, they’re not just intimidating. They’re right out scary. Instead of saying “My wife must do this, this and that and my children must do that or else…” Try being more suggestive. Say “Would it not be better for our children if they had a better income than ballet provides?” or “Why are you opposed to leading our children towards cosmology”.
That’s kinder and gentler – things you need as a leader.
Meh. I offer a lot. If women want to settle for less, let them. We just had an election where 67% of unmarried women voted for free birth control pills and free abortions and gay marriage. I realize most single women don’t want to be led by a man, even if they choose him. They don’t want to respect a man. That’s fine – I can just avoid marrying women who don’t want to be led. I am understanding a lot about single women from these elections. They don’t want to be led by a man, they want men to pay for their birth control pills and abortions and they want children to be raised by single mothers and gay couples. When I meet a single woman, I assume that she holds those views, even if she denies it. And I won’t believe that she doesn’t hold those views until I see the evidence of it in her record and actions. There is a two-thirds chance that a single woman thinks that it is OK to abort a child because it is the wrong sex – and that I should have to pay for it. That’s what most single women are really like. That’s what they want. That’s what they believe. And if I am going to get married, I have to make sure that I don’t marry that.
I think it is interesting that almost no women hold other women accountable for these sorts of views. Instead, I am told by everyone that I need to change, and lower my standards. I am the one who has to change. I am the one who has to just go ahead and get married to make a woman who has no respect for me happy.
Right. With that attitude, you’re going to drive away the good women along with the bad ones. You do know why gentleness is important, right?
Wintery,
I agree with much of your assessment of single women these days. However, I would like to point out a few things about good women which I hope you know, and if you don’t sit up and pay attention.
While you no doubt would bring much to the marriage table (espcially financially, if I understand you correctly), there are things a women looks for (yes, good women too) besides money and Christian character and knowledge. A woman needs to feel safe with the man she marries. Safe from outsiders who would hurt her, yes. But more importantly, she needs to feel that her heart is safe, that it will be treasured and protected. She needs a man to listen to her and still love her, even if he disagrees with her. It is one of the deepest needs for a woman to feel cherished by her man. It’s like respect is to men. Men need to feel respected in order to feel love. Women need to feel safe and protected emotionally in order to feel loved. We women do have more fragile emotions and that’s a design that God planned for us. It makes us better nurturers. Not all women are slaves to their emotions, but all of us have more sensitive emotions than the average man and we need to know that our opinions, fears, and insecurities will be listened to, taken seriously, and that none of this will cause our husband to reject, belittle, or look down on us. Until that deepest need of our hearts is met, we care little for money or other assets that a man may have. Just as you would never marry a woman who had all the right attributes, but failed to respect you, no good woman will marry a man who has all the right attributes, but fails to make her feel cherished.
With that in mind, consider developing (and demonstrating to potential wives) the trait of gentleness. There may be a lot of bad women, but there are also many women out there who would be thrilled to find a strong Christian man capable of leading and providing for a family. But they will fear to submit to a man whose idea of leadership is to become a mini-dictator (or who they think may tend in that direction). A real leader inspires confidence by proving himself capable to make good decisions AND by proving the ability to properly care for those who follow him. Proving the latter (with regard to marriage) includes demonstrating gentleness and the ability to protect a woman’s more fragile emotions.
The thing is, a person doesn’t have to do amazing things for God with their job. They can always do amazing things in their private life. As just one example, I am pretty sure that Wintery Knight doesn’t make much money off this blog. But Wintery, if you don’t want your money spent on unproductive pursuits then just set it aside in an account separate from all marriage funds, and tell your wife and kids that they can only have it under the conditions you set. If they want poetry, fine, but they just can’t have any of your stash.
Drew, I think that is a very good compromise. The thing is that there are competent Christians who need help now to achieve rally good goals, and so I don’t want to get involved in a marriage that is going to take away from being able to help with that.
I think it’s hard enough for any given Christian man to find a woman who believes in Jesus, is reasonably good-looking, is sexually undefiled, and does not vote for abortion or socialism. I personally think that it is unwise to pile a bunch of extra conditions on top of all that. Regardless of what you or your potential wife want, you can’t really force a child to take your precise path. Generally, I think it’s hard enough just to make sure they get high grades, stay off drugs, don’t delve into any dumb ideas like Calvinism or socialism, etc.
You can always set standards for your children and lead them to obey God, but at the end of the day, their steps are ordered by the Lord, and not their earthly father. Teaching children to obey God in all things is paramount; setting up specific paths that you’ve determined are best for them (before they’re even born! and before you know whether they have the aptitude for them) is not.
Also, it’s for God to determine how best someone glorifies Him; and it’s not for us to decide that a person in one vocation is more important than a person in another. That is certainly not a godly or Scriptural perspective, and I’m not trying to be harsh, but such an idea certainly did not come from God. This is why Jesus said that the last will be first and the first will be last. If someone becomes a gardener and lives a truly holy life, sharing the Gospel, and serving others, no one is to come behind and say that their life has not been as significant as someone who is a banker or a lawyer.
Many parents who decide to order every aspect of their children’s lives discover that it can often create rebellion and actually denigrate the children’s respect for them rather than grow it. Moreover, if you disparage what is a passion of your children’s (say, creative writing), it will only breed resentment. So, that’s a gentle caution.
I would have to ask, What do you think a woman as such brings to the table? You’ve said that you have a lot to offer. But certainly the Lord created women with unique gifts that you as a man do not have. Is it possible that you might have something to learn from women who question your stances on certain things? Leadership is about taking the initiative, not assuming that you’re always 100% correct.
I would imagine that for a thinking woman, you might easily insult her intelligence by assuming that if she doesn’t see things your way, that she must be unlearned. Just as an occasional passerby, I can guarantee that I’m very familiar with pretty much all of the subjects you mention; but that doesn’t mean that I agree with every conclusion that you draw. Clearly individuals who marry have to be compatible values-wise, but if what you want is a thinking, reflective woman, then you’ll have to be prepared for the possibility that she is not going to see it your way all the time, and not lose respect for her because of it, or feel like simply by exercising independent thought that she’s threatening your leadership.
All your comment shows is how some women express their desire to not respect husbands or submit to husbands in mystical religious language. What you really mean is this “I don’t want to do what a man says no matter how much more he knows, because my emotions are more important than truth or knowledge.” What you mean by saying that “God only knows X” is that I don’t know. And because I don’t know, I shouldn’t be able to set goals or have any authority to lead. Nor should I be allowed to prefer a woman who accepts my authority to lead above one who refuses to accept my authority to lead. That’s the bottom line.
It’s not that you have a better plan to produce influential children that you want to convince me of, and arguments and evidence to persuade me that your goals are more influential. It’s that you want to deny my plan and substitute NO PLAN, and then invoke God in order to establish that. You want children to do whatever they want and say that whatever they want to do is as influential and effective as what I want them to do. Because you think that I don’t know anything about what the church needs, what the university needs, and what the public square needs, and that I have no right to lead my children to be influential in those areas for the Lord’s sake. And you think that a child who focuses on creative writing (writing fiction!) will be as influential and prosperous as one who focuses on petroleum engineering or economics or experimental science. And you dress up your desire to substitute your agenda for mine in religious language by saying that your view is God’s will and mine isn’t.
Regarding your comment that you know about the things that I would ask about. In my experience, people who say that have not been able to answer the most basic questions that I ask about. So we are at a stalemate. You think that you could answer me, and I think you couldn’t. The only way to find out is for me to ask you specific questions in a situation where you have to answer without looking anything up online or in your library. But I assert that that in my experience, the vast majority of Christian women I have met are reading Harry Potter and C.S. Lewis and Stephanie Meyer and not Stephen Meyer and Thomas Sowell and William Lane Craig. And I mean 99.99% of Christian women.
Wintery! Your whole response caricatures her arguments. Are you being deliberately uncharitable or is something else wrong?
Her point about causing children to rebel I definitely agree with. I doubt that your style would cause them all to rebel, but probably a percentage of them. So you would need to have at least one extra kid, to take into account that at least one of them is going to start smoking pot and get into ballet dancing or something.
LOL! Don’t worry, if I am really trying to influence someone, I am good at getting results. Setting up boundaries has to be tough, and then when you are doing 1-to-1 mentoring, it’s soft and gentle.
Sorry for the late interruption, I was just wondering, because this is what I perceive from the sentence “the vast majority of Christian women I have met are reading … C.S. Lewis …and not Stephen Meyer and Thomas Sowell and William Lane Craig.”, but do you believe that C.S. Lewis was not an effective/serious apologist/philosopher/academic?
It depends which book you’re reading. A lot of his stuff like Narnia and Mere Christianity is good for teens – to get them thinking. Miracles, The Abolition of Man, and the like are good for grown-ups.
Wintery, having read most of your replies on this comment thread, I keep noticing something. You are emphasizing over and over how these women won’t submit or respect you, etc., etc. I think you are also missing the other half of the picture — husbands are supposed to love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for it. Has it occurred to you that you may have to make some sacrifices? Or is it all about your plans for your and your kids’ future?
By no means am I suggesting marrying some woman who doesn’t respect you or share your goals — but in all this you seem to de-emphasize the nature of sacrificial love. It involves more than providing for your family financially. By all means have plans, but realize God may have different, better ones than you. If a woman objects to your ‘plan’ it doesn’t mean she is being emotional and not using her brain. Jesus used all kinds of people to glorify Himself: scribes, tentmakers, fisherman, tax collectors, writers, philosophers, bakers, kings, slaves, etc. Colossians 3:17 comes to mind.
I think I’d be more interested in a woman reading her BIble faithfully than reading William Lane Craig *or* CS Lewis (or any any of the others) Clearly, you are frustrated by not meeting (yet) the woman you have in mind. Be sure you are taking time to examine yourself as well — being a good Godly husband involves more than being a good provider or a good planner. You also need to be cultivating the fruit of the Spirit in your life, not just accumulating knowledge for good theological arguments. Gentleness is just as important as self-control. Good luck, and I will be praying for you.
What I’ve learned is that life can mess up one’s best-laid plans. I live with a number of shattered hopes and dreams, despite much prayer.
About careers: We encouraged our sons to follow study and career paths that matched their abilities and their interests, so they wouldn’t be stuck in a career they’d find they hate. One son is ADHD and non-academic, so he pursued a technical qualification. Not everyone is geared to be an academic and a professional.
Since I came to know the Lord after our sons were born, and my husband is an atheist, I ended up being the moral and spiritual leader and trainer in the home. Once our sons reached their teens, they were not so receptive, so I prayed for them and trusted also that the foundations I’d sown into their lives would remain firm. I used to play Focus on the Family, apologetics and sermon/ Bible-teaching tapes in the car, so they still got some input in addition to church. They are now in their mid- to late 20s. Despite all my moral and spiritual input and prayer, one turned away from the Lord when he left home and is now an anti-theist, one is lukewarm, and one, an introvert, has what one might call a quiet faith. The spiritually tepid ADHD one blames me, rather than their atheist father, for the apostasy of his brother, saying that I “pushed him too hard” (I happen to know there was a moral issue) and uses this against me when I try to encourage him to participate in e.g. a Bible study, since he’s never even read the Bible.
Therefore I continually pray for the Lord to work in my sons lives, to enable them to become the men they need to be in order to be godly husbands and fathers, and I am praying for the Lord to prepare a wife for each of them, a woman who knows and loves the Lord, who will be a good, loving wife and mother. Why do I have such “low” standards, you would say? I grew up with a manipulative, bitter and controlling mother who loved me conditionally, so my home background was toxic. My dream was to have a loving, happy family, which I’d never had, but this plan unravelled seriously when I started a family and my own long-buried issues manifested. I also learned I was not in control of my life, and (although I didn’t realise it at the time) the Lord used this situation to draw me to himself. The Lord had to deal with a lot of issues in my life after I came to know him. I also had an additional new desire, namely for my husband and sons to come to know and love the Lord wholeheartedly, but over 20 years down the line, this hasn’t happened. Let me tell you again, life does not turn out the way one would like it to.
One thing I would caution on, is to watch out for a spirit of domination and control, the “lord and master” syndrome. A good leader is not a controller, but rather inspires people to follow him, which is what Jesus did. I know enough women who’ve been married to domineering men who abused them emotionally. Because the Gospel often impacts the lives of those who have been hurt, the church is full of damaged people, especially men, from toxic backgrounds who have never faced, dealt with and found healing for their deep issues (which is why one also encounters the problem of spiritual abuse by some church leaders). It takes two emotionally and psychologically whole people to build a stable, loving marriage and family.
Just some food for thought…
Hi Wintry
Well, I don’t know where to start! Firstly I think your enthusiasm for following the Lord needs to be totally commended and I really do think that the passion and commitment you demonstrate towards Him should be and doubtless is demonstrated in every detail of your day to day life following Him in closeness and obedience, delighting in Him and submitting to His every nuance and wish, to the nth degree. I would really encourage you to do this, more and even more, as I know He will draw you closer and closer. I think this degree of closeness is even part of your calling from Him and I suggest you are not only called but also chosen. If you read John’s gospel chapters 14-17 carefully you will learn to find a deep communion with Him that is rarely found. I think you have the personality type to go really deep with God.
Secondly I can tell you that out there in your future will be the woman for you. Maybe not right now, but God will bring her along in His good time and you can rest in that assurance of His love for you. She is and will be your perfect mate, partner, helpmeet and friend and the only criteria I would dare to offer would be to try to marry someone who is closer to the Lord than you are, in your view.
Thirdly and slightly more controversially, don’t diss all women because you’ve chatted with a few. I don’t dismiss all men because I’ve met a few who I don’t agree with! I have been a Christian for 25 years or more, I have also got a 2.1 degree from Cambridge, England in Physics and Theoretical Physics and I have done a year in Kenya as a missionary. I could argue particle physics with you or help you run an Alpha course or debate the details of Daniel’s dreams or Paul’s prayers. I can speak in tongues or prophesy, I can calm down children or teach school physics, math or chemistry. I can get on with Americans, Chinese and Brits. I can get by in French, German and Swahili. I can listen to your dreams and then challenge you with the depths of His love for me, and incidentally also His immense love for you. I can show you the man Jesus in His brown skin, black hair and sparkling eyes, the man who wouldn’t be apparent in a crowd because there was nothing in Him to make us desire Him by His appearance. I can show you Him in His glory on the sea of ice above the four wheels within wheels and the living creatures of ox, eagle, lion and man. I can paint these for you or I can relate them to the Four Gospels and link this to your personality type.
Most of this I could have done before I was married (sorry I’m not available). The only question I asked about getting married was ‘who is the name in my heart, Lord?’, and I didn’t ask that of the man who was raising the questiony And I actually saw marriage in a rather uncomplimentary way at that time, as a type of dying to self because I would no longer be independent but part of some new whole and never a single one but only a half…leading to a lack of choice over my life…as I said, a kind of death, worked out daily. In the same way as I die daily in my life in Christ, so that I no longer live but Christ lives in me, so also I die that the new We might live together in oneness, in unity. I see it now as walking together in the Lord. If we disagree, we talk and pray until we are in agreement. If one of us pushes the other into something, it generally doesn’t work.
As I said, you have a gift of passion in your heart for The Lord, use that to walk His ways as closely as you can, waiting for the girl who is right for you and don’t assume anything except that it will be a fabulous adventure needing tons and tons of faith, love, mercy and grace! Enjoy the ride!
Blessings
Ambling Saint
Every woman in my church complains that there are no Christian men in the church. I attend a small church with under 100 people.
There are about twenty five of us guys who are single, and about twenty of us who have never been married. Most of us fall between the ages of 29-40.
Most of us have given up asking in church….first of all it makes us look like creeps, secondly….some of these women are not models of youth themselves, and lastly….we want a woman who puts God first.
None of us have seen that

… so I can’t nitpick the Arsenal Christmas video too much, but I barely believe anything they’re saying. Watching a stone faced guy say “merry christmas” before removing a Santa hat that says “Merry Christmas” across the front is all well and good, as is making grown men who don’t speak a hell of a lot of English wear Rudolph noses and antlers and speak English, but I can’t shake the feeling that as soon as the cameras stopped rolling they tossed off their Christmas sweaters and started plotting its downfall. Maybe movies have taught me to be too judgmental of athletic Europeans.
Writing your own Arsenal Christmas wishes is pretty fun, though, you have to take a really simple sentences or phrases like “Merry Christmas” and say them in the most roundabout way possible. “I believe, that if possible, I will have, a merry Christmas.”
Also, pretty sure Abou Diaby is where Garfield keeps trying to ship Nermal.

So far, 620 Americans have developed serious infections related to the outbreak, including 367 cases of deadly meningitis, and 39 people have died. Of the 19 U.S. states affected, Michigan has been worst hit, handling more than one third of the total cases in the outbreak.
St Joseph Mercy - a 537-bed Catholic hospital located in Ypsilanti, on the doorstep of the University of Michigan - has treated 169 of the state's 223 cases of infections that can cause meningitis, including 7 people who died.
At one point it was so overrun that 87 of its 537 beds, which are usually occupied by patients with cancer or heart ailments and the like, were occupied by patients with fungal meningitis and related infections.
Dr Tom Chiller, the fungal disease expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who has been overseeing the outbreak, praised the work of the hospital in helping to limit deaths from the outbreak.
"They have been incredibly creative in dealing with these complicated patients," he said.
In all, almost 14,000 people seeking relief from back and joint pain received injections from moldy steroid shots made at the now-bankrupt New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts before they were recalled in late September.
CDC experts initially feared death rates in the 40 to 50 percent range; instead, only about 6 percent of those infected have died, and the CDC credits the creative and dogged efforts of state and local health officials for keeping the death rates so low.
The first wave of the outbreak involved the most severe cases of meningitis - an inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. But starting in mid-October, patients who had been recovering from meningitis were developing potentially fatal localized infections near the site where contaminated drug was injected to treat back or neck pain.
As they started seeing more cases of these local, secondary infections, the staff at St Joseph's devised a bold plan to screen all patients in their database looking for potential new infections that might have been missed in the first wave.
On December 20, the CDC issued an alert to doctors incorporating some of lessons learned by the efforts of doctors at St Joseph's and other hospitals, calling for increased screening of patients who may be harboring localized infections.
A BEWILDERING FUNGI
Among the patients who developed secondary infections was Bonita Robbins, a 72-year-old retired nurse from Pinckney, Michigan, who received doses of the tainted drug at the Michigan Pain Specialists clinic in the nearby town of Brighton while seeking relief for lower-back pain.
The first shot brought some relief, the second did little to ease her aches, and the third was contaminated. In October, Robbins went to St Joseph's with a severe headache, back pain and pain in her thighs.
She spent 37 days in the hospital taking two kinds of antifungal drugs.
Dr Anurag Malani, an infectious disease specialist treating Robbins, said the challenge with the outbreak was that there was no medical literature to fall back on.
"No one has ever seen anything of this magnitude related to fungal infections, ever," he said.
Chiller said U.S. doctors had never treated meningitis caused by Exserohilum rostratum, the environmental mold causing most of the infections.
"It's just a rare, rare cause of infection." Seeing that mold in the meninges - membranes covering the brain and spinal cord - is "completely new."
Initially, St Joseph's Fungal Outbreak Clinic was started in order to coordinate the care of patients after their discharge, which included overseeing the administration of a complex regime of anti-fungal drugs.
It morphed into something bigger when some of its 53 patients with meningitis started returning with infections near the site in their back or neck where the contaminated drug was injected.
Then came a wave of patients like Robbins, who had been ruled out for meningitis with a spinal tap, but were still complaining of pain near their injection site.
GETTING THE 'BIGGER BOAT'
"When it became obvious that the number of patients would be a much higher percentage than anticipated by the CDC, we expanded our clinic and started enlisting the help of several other hospitals," Vandenberg said.
Many of the patients had spinal abscesses, an infection in the space between the outside covering of the spinal cord and the bones of the spine. Others developed arachnoiditis, an infection of nerves within the spinal canal.
The decision to screen all patients in the hospital database who might have received tainted injections was not taken at the recommendation of the CDC.
"That was our own decision," said Vandenberg, a specialist in internal medicine overseeing the screening effort.
He admitted that the strategy was aggressive, but said that, especially early on, doctors feared the local infections might be precursors to meningitis, making catching them early a potentially life-saving move.
Excluding patients who had already been screened and those who had injections in areas other than the spine, the hospital targeted about 500 patients for MRI scans.
Most so far have had private insurance that covers the screening. For the uninsured, the hospital's Patient Financial Services department has been helping them to apply for financial support.
"We did over 400 MRIs in about a 4-week period," Vandenberg said. The hospital screened so many patients, in fact, that the state of Michigan sent in an emergency mobile MRI unit to help.
Vandenberg got the task of reading stacks of MRI reports, sometimes as many as 30 a day.
So far, about 20 percent of the MRIs have shown up as abnormal, meaning that patients have to come back for surgery and treatment.
Vandenberg makes all of those calls personally. Not all of them go smoothly. He likens the gravity of the conversation - learning you have a potentially deadly new disease that requires months of treatment with risky drugs - to telling someone they have cancer.
After one especially tough call, in which a heart patient feared he would not survive the surgery he would need to clear his infection, Vandenberg cracked.
"I started crying. I probably haven't cried for 15 years."
SIGNS OUTBREAK IS EASING
But at last, after months of onslaught, there are signs the outbreak is easing.
Attendance at the hospital's daily support group has begun to taper off. And since the beginning of December, more than 50 patients with fungal infections have been discharged, while only 20 have been admitted, bringing the total number of fungus-related inpatient to 30.
Vandenberg nevertheless cautions that the outbreak is still far from over.
"Every single day of this screening program, we're finding one or two cases that are abnormal and need to be admitted," he said.
Vandenberg gave the CDC access to the clinic's database so the agency could see how the effort turned out, and this month, the CDC issued the alert to doctors incorporating some of the results of the MRI screening program.
The alert warned that some patients who got tainted injections but did not develop meningitis may still be at risk of localized infections.
And it urged doctors to consider ordering an MRI for all patients who still have pain, even if the pain is similar to what sent them in for treatment in the first place.
Chiller said the United States had not yet reached the end of the outbreak.
"Unfortunately, with fungi, the incubation periods are so long and they can remain indolent. I'm definitely concerned that we're going to continue to see more cases."

BARROW-IN-FURNESS, England (Reuters) - told Reuters in her modest home in Barrow-in-Furness, a shipyard town once at the heart of Britain's industrial revolution. "It's a surprise really. Quite a surprise. Big surprise."
Iveson's link to Romney came to light when her inquisitive grandson-in-law began tracing back their family history by delving into archives in their home county of Lancashire.
Records show.
"(My brother) looks quite like him. He had dark hair like him. It's all grey now. He (Romney) looks like our Mike. Same sort of face and everything."
She offers a shrug and a smile when asked about Romney's wealth and privileged status in the United States, where he is sometimes accused by critics of being out of touch with poor people. "I wish him luck and everything else," she said.
ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST
Romney is one of the wealthiest Americans ever to run for the White House. He has estimated his fortune at between $190 million and $250 million.
But for Romney, his faith and English roots remain a sensitive issue, partly because his Mormon religion is still regarded with suspicion by some American voters.
When he came to Britain in July this year, Romney did not visit the area where his family have their roots - unusual since emphasizing a European heritage is often seen as an electoral plus in U.S. politics.
Barack Obama, who faces Romney in the November 6 presidential election, went down well last year when he toured an Irish village where one of his forebears once lived.
Romney's campaign spokeswoman made no comment when asked how the Republican challenger felt about his English origins.
In Lancashire, the county the candidate's ancestors left behind, Romney enthusiasts offered their own explanation.
"He is Mormon and this is Mormon central," said Christopher Nelson, a local vicar with an interest in Romney's heritage. "Perhaps he would perceive (coming here) as highlighting his Mormonism more than highlighting his roots."
His known relatives in England are genealogically so far removed that many of them were not even aware of the link until recently when the U.S. election campaign began to gather pace.
Amateur genealogist Simon Nash was astonished to discover while digging into regional records that his wife Maria was Mitt Romney's fourth cousin twice removed.
Poring over archival material and photos on his laptop in his home in the industrial city of Preston, Nash said it was a matter of tracing people back to a common ancestor - a fairly easy task since most records are available publicly in Britain.
The quest has certainly made Nash, whose day job involves dressing in a duck outfit and posing as a mascot for a local football team, more interested in U.S. politics.
"If he got in, America would be a completely different place in three years time to what it is now," he said. "I don't know if it will be for the better."
Nash's wife Maria, 32, was equally astounded by his researches.
"I was very much shocked ... It still feels like ... it's not quite happening to (me)," said Maria, who is Jennie Iveson's granddaughter. "It's quite an unreal feeling."
Would she like to meet Romney in the White House? "I think it would be very surreal," she said with a shy giggle. "I would like to go there for a brew (cup of tea) if he ever got in there."
WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
The village of Dalton-in-Furness, a picturesque scattering of mediaeval cottages, is where the Romney clan began. Its men are still remembered there as hard-working carpenters.
One of them was William Romney, who gained notoriety for making his own coffin and putting it on display in his workshop before he died in 1915.
"I get the impression that quite a few Romneys were carpenters. It seems to be a family trait," Jim Walton, a Dalton historian, said outside a canary-yellow cottage where William Romney used to live and work.
"Should Mitt Romney succeed and become the next president of the United States, he would be able to look around in pride and say: 'My great great granddad came from Dalton-in-Furness'. Well, I hope he can say that in pride."
Dalton has plenty of Romney-related history. Its most famous son was George Romney, who went to London and became one of the most celebrated portrait painters of the 18th century.
Two streets and a park are named after the artist, who is said to have had a secret affair with the mistress of Lord Nelson, the naval hero who defeated the French at Trafalgar.
George was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's parish church - where Mitt Romney's great-great grandparents, Elizabeth and Miles, were baptized and married before converting to the Mormon faith in 1837 and moving to the United States.
Their daughter Sarah's baptism record from the year before is still in the archives in Preston, with her father's vocation - joiner - scribbled in an old parish book.
"It's a fascinating story that Dalton holds," said Rev. Alan Mitchell, gazing over the town's skyline from the top of a church tower - a view that has changed little since Romneys lived here. Pointing at a couple of old communion cups, he added: "The Romneys could have touched these."
At the time, Lancashire was a tough, polluted and chaotic place to live, and disease and drunkenness were rife. Mormon promises of a better and more orderly life fell on fertile ground.
"It was a grimy, mucky hell on earth," said Nelson, the vicar. "Why on earth you would want to stay here, if somebody tells you there is milk and honey elsewhere? It was a horrible place."
FREE TICKET
Early Mormon missionaries offered not only salvation but a free ticket to the United States.
They also gave Miles Romney a position of authority aboard a ship called the Sheffield, making the arrangement all the more attractive for a young and ambitious man with a large family.
But many other Romneys never converted and stayed behind in England, and the relatives who live here today know little about Mormonism.
In his autobiography, Mitt Romney said the family left England for New Orleans and travelled by steamer up the Mississippi to Nauvoo, Illinois, where they joined other Mormons. Later they followed Mormons in a trek across the plains to Utah. "Romneys are, by nature, an adventurous breed," he wrote.
The Mormon fascination with the souls of their ancestors means they have one of the world's biggest family history archives. The Mormon temple near Preston still contains records detailing the lives of British Romneys.
One document, describing the state of Miles Romney's family after emigration, listed his job as a joiner and said: "In 1850 Miles had a household of ten, and a real wealth of £200."
The area is still very much the heartland of British Mormonism. The Ribble, a local river, is known as the River Jordan of European Mormonism. This is where England's early Mormons were baptized.
A memorial near its muddy bank commemorates those early conversions. Europe's biggest Mormon temple is nearby, its spire towering high above the misty, rain-washed hills. Neatly dressed missionaries in dark suits and ties are frequent visitors.
"The missionaries that we see coming from America will have roots that originated here in England," said Bishop Michael Turner, leader of a local Mormon congregation. "It's an exciting time ... to have a candidate who is a member of the church."
But for some, Romney is an unpopular figure, particularly after he suggested during his visit this year that Britain was not ready to host the Olympic Games.
"I think Mitt Romney is rather careless in his choice of words sometimes," said Walton, the Dalton historian. "But there you are. Can't have everything, can you?"

Damascus Dragged Into Syrian War With Latest Wave Of Bombings
Originally published on Fri February 22, 2013 6:47 pm

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:
This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block.
We're going to step back now and look at the military balance in Syria. It's one day after the capital, Damascus, was hit with the deadliest bombings since the revolt began nearly two years ago. More than 80 people were killed, over 200 were wounded. The attacks were the most sustained challenge yet to the home base of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Also, rebels have scored a string of victories in the northern part of Syria. NPR's Deborah Amos has this story on how the conflict is evolving.
DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: As ambulances raced through Damascus, the residents of the capital felt the force of a conflict that's been fought everywhere else but downtown Damascus. And civilians are bearing the brunt of the battle as rebels and the regime dial up the brutality. Syrian state media calls car bombs terror weapons. But the Syrian army fires ballistic missiles that level apartment blocks, targeting civilians in rebel-held towns, says military analyst Jeffrey White.
JEFFREY WHITE: We see a couple of launches almost every day. And these are just basic terror weapons. They have, you know, no practical military value in this war against the rebel forces.
AMOS: The fighting has become more intense, says White, as heavier weapons are introduced. The new firepower for the rebels comes from sophisticated weapons seized from Syrian army bases. But recently, the more intriguing additions, says White, are portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons not found in the Syrian arsenal, Chinese and European made. These weapons have recently shown up in rebel battle videos and make a qualitative difference, says White.
WHITE: It's not the silver bullet or the magic gun or whatever that's going to bring down the regime, but these weapons are ideal for the rebel forces. They're light. And it gives them additional means, let's say, to attack the regime's armor and to attack the regime's strong points.
AMOS: He is convinced momentum is with the rebels, especially in the north, where he expects the besieged city of Aleppo to fall soon. But even so, says Yezid Sayigh at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, Aleppo in rebel hands is not the end of the war. The city will not become Syria's Benghazi, he says, referring to the rebel capital that launched Libya's successful revolution. Syria's rebels remain disorganized, lacking command and control. And he says the regime can continue to pound Aleppo's population with ballistic missiles and artillery.
YEZID SAYIGH: So the fall of Aleppo will be significant in morale terms. But in operational military terms, what it will do, I think, is cement a very broad stalemate between those northern regions and the rest of the country held by the government.
AMOS: A long-term stalemate is dangerous for Syria's neighbors. There's already a dramatic rise in refugees. This week, a battle captured on a rebel video added new tensions with neighboring Lebanon. The rebels and Syrian opposition leaders charged that members of Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese militia, crossed into Syria to fight alongside the army and is now all-in to ensure President Assad's survival.
RANDA SLIM: I think all-in is an appropriate description. Hezbollah's role has evolved over the course of the conflict.
AMOS: That's Randa Slim, a Middle East fellow at the New America Foundation, just back from a research trip to Lebanon. She says Hezbollah stepped up its military role after its patron, Iran, said the fall of the Assad is unacceptable.
SLIM: Then we have seen Hezbollah up the ante on its involvement in Syria and now, according - again, to many credible reports, is engaged in the fighting in the ranks of the regime forces.
AMOS: Many military analysts say that Bashar al-Assad can't win the war, but he's a long way from losing it. Joe Holliday at the Institute for the Study of War has been watching videos of Assad's army, often shown on Russian TV.
JOSEPH HOLLIDAY: And these videos show Republican Guard troops in uniforms, all buttoned up with helmets. When you look at all these rebel gains, while they are important, it's important not to underestimate the staying power that the regime does have.
AMOS: And most analysts agree that the longer the war goes on, the more fractured Syria becomes. The war is tearing the country apart. But no side seems to be tired of the fight. Deborah Amos, NPR News, Antakya. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

Study: Illness More Likely in Eastern Kentucky Coal County Than Non-Coal Counties
A new health study in Eastern Kentucky has found that residents in a county where surface mining is prevalent have a higher instance of illness than residents in two control counties.
West Virginia University professor Michael Hendryx analyzed information from 952 adults in Eastern Kentucky. Some of the subjects were from Floyd County, where about two-thirds of the coal mined comes from surface mines. The rest were in Rowan and Elliott counties, where there’s no coal mining but comparable socioeconomic factors. The surveys were done by a Christian group called Restoring Eden, which advocates for environmental stewardship.
Hendryx controlled for factors like age, obesity and cigarette smoking. Even so, he found that people who lived in Floyd County were at significantly elevated risk for a variety of health problems, like hypertension, COPD and asthma, as well as general poor health.
Previous studies have shown higher instances of air pollution in coal counties, as well as higher rates of cancer and birth defects. A lot of the air issues in these counties have been linked to silica dust, which can come from blasting away rocky overburden at mountaintop removal sites.
This study only looked at health data, and can only conclude that the Floyd County residents surveyed were more likely to suffer from poor health than those surveyed from Rowan and Elliott counties. Hendryx says it’s nearly impossible to link one environmental problem with a specific health effect, but he thinks enough evidence exists to suggest policymakers should act.
“The environmental contribution is not the only thing going on,” he said. “These communities have populations that are in poor health for a number of reasons. But I think there is an environmental contribution. I can’t prove it, but just based on everything I’ve seen, I believe that there is.”
He says based on the precautionary principle, there’s enough evidence that links coal mining and health problems that it’s prudent and ethical to address the problem.
Hendryx has conducted numerous studies on coal mining’s effect on health, and the coal industry pointed to this body of work to discredit the most recent study. Another criticism involved the inclusion of Rowan County as a control county; though it’s in Eastern Kentucky, the county is home to Morehead State University and close to Lexington. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that the higher education levels and per capita income in Rowan County mean that it’s not a reasonable comparison. Hendryx acknowledged the potential problem, but says it was important to choose a nearby county where there’s no coal mining, and he thinks the comparison is a fair one.

Rumor has it Taylor Swift already has a new boyfriend. (Expect a new song about him in three to four business days.) Just a few weeks after her reported split with Connor Kennedy, Swift is supposedly taking up with Harry Styles of One Direction.
The chatter was ignited by Mario Lopez, who went on his radio show and claimed that Swift and Styles were ""hand in hand"" backstage at The X Factor, whatever that's worth. But if Swifty and Styles are looking to keep their supposed romance under wraps, they're doing a pretty awful job of it: they were spotted over, and over, and over again taking in the sights of New York's Central Park over the weekend as they ramp up to the 2012 Jingle Ball. The duo are looking mighty cozy, no?
And in this particular shot, the lovebirds have added another piece of intrigue to their recent romance: uh, whose baby is that? Now, you're probably making the same shocked Swift face she has down to an art form, but you can lock your jaw back up in its rightful location. The teeny toddler is the daughter of Styles' friend Lou Teasdale and his fiance, who were out strolling through the park with the pop star duo.

Malaria Drug Subsidies: Good Idea Or Wrong Path?
A month ago we wrote about results from an experiment in getting the most effective malaria drugs to more people who need them in Africa.
The idea was to subsidize the cost of drugs, sometimes to a price point below their wholesale cost, and make them more widely available.
Now the findings, presented publicly at a meeting in Washington, have been published in The Lancet.
In most of the countries where the subsidies were tried, the share of the market for artemisinin-combination therapies, or ACTs, went up a lot. In Zanzibar (part of Tanzania) and Nigeria, the ACT drugs helped drive down sales of one-drug treatments. Those so-called monotherapies, which are cheaper, are a problem because they can spur drug-resistant malaria.
The Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria program, or AMFm, brought more than 100 million doses of malaria drugs to clinics and pharmacies in 2011.
"The programme has been highly controversial," the authors of the study acknowledge. A big worry: Middlemen would pocket the subsidies and consumers, especially the poorest ones, wouldn't benefit.
Others say the program, a pilot test of the concept, hasn't been able to show it saves lives or made a dent in resistance. The aid group Oxfam blasted the approach, saying it's risky and a distraction:
The Affordable Medicine Facility–malaria has shown no evidence that it has saved the lives of the most vulnerable or delayed drug resistance. Rather, this global subsidy has incentivised medicine sales without diagnosis and shown no evidence that it has served poor people. It poses a risk to public health and could skew investment away from effective solutions.
Oxfam recommends that the board of the Global Fund pull the plug on it next month.
But supporters of the idea, writing an accompanying editorial in The Lancet, disagree, saying a board vote against the program would be a mistake:
Most importantly, it will kill a programme that, when fully implemented, rapidly met its benchmarks despite the many constraints, expectations and unrealistic timelines imposed on it. We must acknowledge that an efficient approach to subsidising antimalarial drugs has worked, making them available in the private sector where people go to buy them.

White House Unveils New Fracking Regulations
Originally published on Fri May 4, 2012 6:04 pm
Transcript
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
The Obama administration today released a new set of rules for oil and gas drilling on public land. As NPR's Elizabeth Shogren reports, the rules are meant to keep companies from polluting water when they use the engineering technique known as fracking.
ELIZABETH SHOGREN, BYLINE: Hydraulic fracturing is what made the current drilling booms possible. Companies force hundreds of thousands of gallons of water, sand, and chemicals deep underground to open up cracks in the rock and make the oil or natural gas flow faster..

Fourth-quarter sales fell 16 percent to $7.28 billion, generating core earnings, which exclude certain items, down 3 percent at $1.56 per share. The slower decline in earnings reflected lower costs and a favorable tax adjustment.
Analysts had, on average, forecast sales of $7.20 billion and earnings of $1.35 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Stripping out the tax effect, EPS was broadly in line.

Here are some of my thrift store finds from the last two weeks. Last week, my finds fell under a tidy theme, "Think Pink."
This week, not so much. It's all good. My favourite find was this little owl. Not sure what my deal is with owls, but I just love 'em.
I like the shape of this brass thingy. That's the technical name right? Thingy.
I got this tiny green vase.
And this pretty standing mirror. I was excited when I saw it from a distance. Up close, it's actually plastic. But still cute.
I like the pattern on the frame.
I also bought six of these melamine bowls. They were from a dollar store originally. They cost me 29 cents each. I don't really need them, but they remind me that there will be summer one day.
I got matching plates as well.
Have you been to the thrift store lately? Score any great deals?
Yes, I went to two this morning [Savers and Plato's Closet] I found my stuff at Plato's this time. Perhaps they will be appearing this week in some new posts of mine? hint hint.
We don't have those stores here. Makes me want to travel. ;) Can't wait to see your finds. :)
thingy is an official name. in my home it is also referred to as 'the-you-know'. (he usually does *not* know.) ;)
i also really like that mirror.
Thanks for supporting me on that Chrissy! ;) You are funny - he does "not" know. I totally get that. :)
Whoot! I love the owl! You always find the coolest thingies!
Thanks Miss Tabetha! :)
I like those bowls. I can't believe they're melamine - the palm trees really look like something painted on china. Nice haul!
Visiting from The Weekly Thrift at Young Heart.
Thanks Val! I'm glad you like the bowls. I felt a bit funny about including dollar store plastic in my thrift finds post. :)
yes definitely a brass thingy or possibly a brassy thing! great to stop by via the linkup x
"Brassy thing" is good too. ;) Thanks for visiting. Jo
I love that little wooden owl. Beautiful finds and photos, the blue backdrop makes them pop!
Thanks so much! :)
That owl is so adorable! He makes me giggle. Great Finds!
New follower stopping by from the GFC blog hop!

Thanks! And thanks for visiting and following! :)
Such great pieces again, loving your taste darling.

Bex
Thanks. That's very sweet of you to say. :)
Your owl is too cute - looks so wise!
Kate x
Thanks Kate! :)
Great finds! Love that cute owl. I haven't been thrifting in a couple of weeks, and I think my husband is afraid to let me go since I keep bringing back furniture...
I would love to find furniture. I never see anything good! You have been lucky. :)
Great finds - I'm always looking for little bottles. I put feathers in them that we find when birds have lost them - and tiny bouquets.
Oh, I love tiny bouquets of wildflowers. None to pick here right now with the snow. Can't wait until spring.
Serious mirror envy! Thanks for linking up!
Thanks Lucy!
I haven't been thrifting in a while, unfortunately. I love thrifting vicariously through you!
You gotta get back out there Laurie. Just to ease my guilt. :)
I also cant resist owls! Very cute
So funny, huh? I CANNOT resist. :)
I like owls, too. :) That mirror is great, I don't think anyone would know that it's plastic unless they got very close. Nice plates/bowls, too... Ya, summer will be here all right. All 98 humid degrees of it. Yayyyyy (not). ;)
I sure didn't know. ;)
I really feel for you...not. Just kidding, I hate intense heat too. Something in between would be appreciated!
I can't believe that mirror is plastic! So pretty. I love the "brass thingy," too.
I was counting on you to have a better description for it Heather. ;)
Love the owl, it's a gorgeous shape! and the tiny green vase is just wonderful.
I'm new to your blog, I'm excited to find a thrifty and vegan blog - I'm a lazy vegan with mild food intolerances so really needing the inspiration!
So will be following along :)
Greetings from Finland!
Aniko from idleneedle.blogspot.com
Thanks very much! I like that - thrifty and vegan. I hope I can provide some inspiration. ;)

Women Liberal Democrats welcome the re-election of President Barack Obama.
We are especially pleased to see the importance of the women's vote in the election. Their views were not only seen as relevant, but as essential parts of the campaign. It was clear that the Republicans failed to address many American women's concerns - and not just those about reproductive rights, but jobs and taxes too.
There have also been record numbers of women elected to the House (81) and Senate (20) - and a disproportionate number of these women are Democrats (we wonder what happened to Mitt Romney's 'binders of women'…)
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand celebrated the women who ran for office, and lost - an inspiration for women on this side of the Atlantic too:

2013, you’re getting your mojo on. Today, you’re making plans.
So let’s get right to it.
Here are your 5 Steps To Get Off The Fence in 2013. It’s time to make a plan to get happy and thriving:
Step 1 – Determine Where You’re Stuck IN 2013, and the other list is called the OFF THE FENCE / HAPPINESS ACTION PLAN. So, for example, if you want to start your own business in 2013, page in a visible spot. It holds you both accountable, and keeps your eye on the prize.
Step 2 – Commit to Doing the Work
Know that nothing will work unless you do. My grandfather used to say, “Nobody ever drowned in their own sweat.” It was a borrowed expression, but it always stuck with me. Happiness doesn’t come without a commitment to happiness. Without work. Your happiness is a choice. You getting what you want out of life is YOUR DECISION. And the same holds true for your unhappiness. So, commit to doing the work. Whatever your goals are, commit to hustling to make them happen.
Everyday I’m shufflin’… (Don’t you love quoting LMFAO?)
Step 3 – Expand Your Skills
Yes. Expand your skills and commit to learning something new. Often we stay stuck and on the fence because we don’t have the necessary skills and knowledge needed to move forward. So acquire that knowledge and expand your skills. This could mean taking up a new hobby, enrolling in an accounting course, volunteering, or simply giving away your expertise for free. What I mean here is, if you want to become a PAID speaker in 2013.
Step 4 – Get Out There and Meet NEW People
Commit to taking up a new hobby, volunteering, getting more involved in your kids’ school, or joining a networking group – for the purpose of meeting NEW people. What happens is, we often meet the people we need through the law of attraction. For example, I am thinking of finally getting off the fence and creating teleclasses and an app in 2013. I started to ask people if they know anyone who develops apps, and I put it out into the universe. Simply because I reached out to new people and asked them for help, I now have acquired more knowledge, helping me off the fence, moving me closer to my goals.
If you allow yourself to be open, and join places like your local Chamber of Commerce, BNI, writing groups, or just traveling alone, or finding a mentor, I promise, you will attract the people you need who will help propel you closer to your goals.
Step 5 – Make More Time for the Things You Love To Do good, quality decisions. For me, I love spending time with my girlfriends – we laugh, I mean gut-busting laughter, and it does my mind and body good. I also love spending time alone in a bookstore, perusing the aisles with a coffee. It calms me and regroups me. What is it for you?
When you do what you love, you are being good to yourself. You are spoiling yourself. And spoiling yourself is your right. Feeling good allows you to make clear decisions. Do it, guilt-free.
So I wish for all of you, to jump the fence in 2013. I hope you’ll join me.
Are you currently on the fence, or do you have any questions or comments about fence jumping? I know the territory well.
Happy Friday beautiful ladies.

Thank you for visiting.
Sooo love this… i will write down the steps and try something different,
Thankyou soo much for your wise words…
Cheers
Caress..
Caress, glad you enjoyed it. I wish you great happiness in 2013.
Love this post! I just did a very similar one on How to Make 2013 better than 2012. Great minds!
Great post as always Erica! I would love to have your thoughts on this conundrum:
What if you are someone who is on multiple fences? I have a small business that is up and running and I am literally working on 4 other business ideas. They are all like children to me so I can’t imagine ditching any one of them. How can you decide what to focus on and what to put on the backburner?
Thanks, I love reading your tips and tricks.
Jesse, you are burning the candle at both ends, and in the end, chances are, none of the businesses will be successful. You simply won’t have the time, energy or money to give them ALL the attention they need to thrive. I would grow your most viable idea, and put all my resources into that. I can barely run one businesses, let alone multiple. Obviously I would have to hear more, but that is my answer based on your brief explanation.
Happy fence jumping! But FOCUS.

I love fireworks.
We think they’re really cool to watch, too, Samantha! Thanks for visiting Wonderopolis today!
Dear Wonderopolis,
Cool wonder! I think fireworks are so pretty and I love watching them every 4th of July. I actually don’t know how fireworks are made. I think tomorrow’s wonder is about stars.
XOXOXOXOXO,
Paige
Hi, Paige! If you’re not sure how fireworks are made, we encourage you to explore this Wonder of the Day® about them…there are many fun facts to learn! Thanks for being a GREAT Wonder Friend!
Hi! The way fireworks are manufactured is amazing.
Oh, and I have a cold.
We’re super sorry you’ve got a cold, Rahul!
Thanks for letting us know you liked this Wonder…we hope you feel better very soon!
Fireworks are pretty cool. How did they do that display of fireworks?
That display was really awesome, we agree, Sydney! There are special people called “pyrotechnic professionals” who are hired by cities and large events to plan, place and produce those big fireworks shows! They can even make it so the fireworks explode to the beat of music in a song!
I learnd a lot about the fireworks. I learned how they make the pattens and all that. I think it is so, so cool. When it is 4th of July? I always let the fireworks off with my grandpa.
We’re sure glad you learned cool new facts about fireworks by exploring this Wonder, McKenzie! The 4th of July is still a few months away, but it falls on a Wednesday this year! How fun that you and your grandpa share such a special fireworks memory!
Dear Wonderopiles,
Hey, I love all your articles. I liked the one with the llama that spit on the kid.
XOXO,
Lilly
Hi, Lilly! Thank you SO MUCH for letting us know you enjoy visiting Wonderopolis and learning new things from each Wonder of the Day®!
Fire works rock. One time, I almost got hit by a bottle rocket. It was close.
We’re glad you didn’t get hit by that bottle rocket, Hunter! Fireworks are really awesome, but they are SUPER dangerous, too! Please be careful and always have an adult around when you are celebrating with fireworks…we care about all of our Wonder Friends and we don’t want anyone to get hurt!
We really liked it. It was soooooooo interesting, wonderoplis is.
We loved the video, all the bright colors, and we both like fireworks. I like to see them at Disney World!
The fireworks at Disney World are GREAT, we agree, AH and KW! Thank you BOTH for checking out today’s Wonder and for sharing your comment with us!
What a cool 4th of July fireworks. Me and KW loved that wonderoplis is this.
I love it.
We really appreciate your comment, AH and KW! Thank you for being AWESOME Wonder Friends!
Wow, that video was awesome! We hope we can visit Sydney someday. How big is the city of Sydney? We have a guess for tomorrow’s wonder. Is it about Ireland or Scotland, because we think they wear plaid skirts. Have a great day and we’re excited for tomorrow’s.
We’re really excited for tomorrow’s Wonder, too, Mr. Draper’s Class! You guys are GREAT guessers, so we can’t wait to see if your guess for tomorrow is correct! Thanks for hanging out in Wonderopolis with us today!
cool wonder
Could you do a wonder on:
“Does size affect a dog’s age?”
Pleaeaeaeaese
Hello, Kidlego 101! We think your idea for a future Wonder about the size of a dog affecting its age is a GREAT one! We appreciate you letting us know what kind of Wonder you’d like to explore here in Wonderopolis!
Fireworks are so cool! I loved today’s wonder! I wonder what the next wonder will be.
Hi there, Jordan! We’re glad you think fireworks are cool and that you got to learn a little bit more about them by exploring today’s Wonder!
I know how fireworks are made when they are launched by a firecracker!
Thanks for sharing what you know about fireworks, Landon! We’re really happy that you stopped by this Wonder today!
That video was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! I was wondering how those cars didn’t get damaged from the fireworks on the bridge.
Hi, Firebolt 101! That’s a really great question! We think the places where the fireworks were actually set off was protected from people and cars. It might just look like the fireworks are exploding over the cars. We think some more WONDERing is in order to find out for sure, though!
Hi, I was wondering what the song was because I like it. I mean LIKE it.
That’s a GREAT question, Matthew! We’re not sure what the name of the song in the video is, but we like it a lot, too! Thanks for hanging out in Wonderopolis with us today!
Awesome.
We think today’s Wonder was AWESOME, too, Eric! Thanks for letting us know you liked it!
I think tomorrow’s wonder is about the Scottish and the plaid skirts are kilts. I know this cause I am Irish myself.
That’s really cool, Cassidy! Thanks for sharing something about yourself with your friends in Wonderopolis today!
Well, I think that they are made by people having something that you push and it makes fireworks.
Hello, Ashley! Thanks for telling us how you think fireworks are made! You’re an AMAZING Wonder Friend!
I wonder if tomorow wonder is hockey. I loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove hockey.
Hello, Husnain! Thanks for visiting Wonderopolis today! We think a future Wonder about hockey is a GREAT idea! Have you visited these past Wonders that have a little something to do with hockey yet?
Wonder #109 – What Is a Zamboni®?
Wonder #67 – When Were Ice Skates Invented?
Happy WONDERing!
I just want to ask how do they make fireworks in a lot of shapes and colors.
That’s a SUPER question, Saad! The people who make fireworks know exactly which type of container shape, fuse, bursting charge and stars to use to make any shape or color fireworks they want! We really enjoy watching fireworks shows…thanks for visiting this Wonder today!
I love to go and watch the fireworks on 4th of July.
We do, too, Lily! We like celebrating with family and friends and watching the fireworks together!
The song is “If You Believe” by Blues Saraceno if anyone was wondering.
Thanks so much for sharing the name and artist of the song in the video for this Wonder, Matthew! That was super awesome of you to do!
Hello! Today my wonder topic was “How are fireworks made?” Two vocabulary words that I found were aerial and barium. I found lots of new facts like China is the largest manufacturer of fireworks in the world. One fact that I thought was interesting is fireworks are made from gunpowder. I wonder who came up with the idea of fireworks. I enjoyed learning about fireworks!
Hi, Team Unger 20! We think it’s AWESOME that you enjoyed learning about fireworks! We did, too! Thanks so much for stopping by this Wonder of the Day®!
Hi, Wonderopolis. The video was really fun to watch. I never knew zinc was chemistry. A ductile, bluish-white metallic element: used in making Galvanized iron, brass, and other alloys, and as an element in voltaic cells. Symbol: Zn; atomic weight: 65.37; atomic number: 30; specific gravity: 7.14 at 20°C. And that magnesium. I never knew that fireworks had special shells to set them off. And I also never knew that there were so many chemicals in one little firework. How many manufacturing companies make fireworks? Thanks for helping me learn lots about fireworks.
We’re glad you had fun learning about fireworks, Team McNeil 5! Thanks so much for letting us know all the FUN facts you discovered about them!
That was a cool video about fireworks.
Thanks for letting us know you liked this Wonder, buglover…and THANKS for hanging out in Wonderopolis today!
On every Fourth of July, me and my family let fireworks off or we go to the High School to see them and they are very pretty! One year, we let off this one firework and it was the American flag and it said I’m glad to be free that was so COOL!
WOW! That does sound like a really COOL firework, Katlyn! Thank you for sharing some of your family’s 4th of July fireworks traditions with us today!
THIS SUMMER, I’M GOING TO MISSOURI TO GET LOTS OF FIREWORKS SO WE CAN HAVE ONE VERY NICE DAY. WONDEROPOLIS, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO JULY 4TH?
Thanks for sharing what you’ve got planned for the 4th of July, Jon! We’ll be stopping by Wonderopolis first of all (to start the day by celebrating learning something cool), then we will spend the day having fun with family and friends! We will probably sing, “Happy Birthday” to America, too!
I really liked this Wonder of the Day. Fireworks are really cool and awesome, mainly their colors. I also like their sounds.I learned that fireworks were made in China 1,000 years ago. Whoever made fireworks is a huge genius. I learned that the fireworks are made of paper and gunpowder. I learned two new vocabulary words, zinc and aerial. I still have one question after reading this article. Has there been any accidents with fireworks? Thank you for this wonderful topic.
Hi, Team Unger 3! Yes, unfortunately, there have been accidents with fireworks. Please make sure there are always adults around when any fireworks are used, OK? We care about all of our Wonder Friends and don’t want anyone to get hurt!
I like how fast the boats go.
That is called “time lapse” video, Claire! It’s video that’s shot over a long period of time and “sped up” to show that long period of time in a short period of time! We think it’s fun to see the boats go fast, too!
Fireworks are awesome. I wish I had some. Also didn’t know that they can have gunpowder in it. NICE
We think fireworks shows are awesome to watch, too, David! Thanks for letting us know a cool fact you learned about fireworks by exploring this Wonder today!
This is the best.
We think you’re pretty SUPER, Ahmad! Thanks for letting us know you enjoyed our fireworks Wonder!
Fireworks are awesome to see. They appeal nicely.
What a great comment you left for us today, Steven! Thanks for hanging out in Wonderopolis with us today and learning about fireworks!
Hey, wonderopolis. I was wondering how you get a song without the lyrics in a video. Thanks. I love you, wonderopolis. Bye, Matthew Lake.
Hi, Matthew! That’s a GREAT question! There are lots of ways to record music without lyrics and add the song as a background to a video project you are working on! We suggest asking a teacher or parent to help you look for some special music composition programs and video editing software for your computer. It takes a little bit of work to learn the software programs, but we know if you try your best, you can make WONDERful music for your videos!
Thanks, wonderopolis. I love you this the best website ever.
You’re very welcome, Matthew! We’re glad you like hanging out in Wonderopolis and learning new things with us! Let us know how your videos turn out with their AWESOME background music (created by YOU), OK?
Hey, I made a video and it’s great.
We think that ROCKS, Matthew! Thanks so much for letting us know your video-making progress! We knew you could do it if you tried your best! Way to go…we’re SUPER proud of you!
You just made my day 9,99999 PERCENT HAPPIER. THANK YOU.
That’s GREAT, Matthew! Thanks for letting us know you liked this Wonder about fireworks. We think your comment is 100% AWESOME!
Hi wonderopolis, can you make a wonder about puberty and changes? Thank you, this wonder is for my cousin, thanks.
Hello, Matthew! Thanks so much for suggesting a future Wonder about puberty! We appreciate hearing from our Wonder Friends (like you and your cousin) about the things they’d like to WONDER more about here in Wonderopolis!
Hi wonderopolis. Thanks for being so nice, I appreciate it. Your friend, Matthew.
P.S CAN U MAKE A WONDER ABOUT WHY KIDS HAVE BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS AND WHY THEY KISS I WANT TO SHARE THIS WITH MY CLASS PLUS OUR TEACHER SHOWS US WONDEROPOLIS EVERY DAY HER NAME IS Kelly Croy. Your friend, Matthew
:)
Hello there, Matthew! Thanks so much for sharing this SUPER comment with us today and for letting us know what kind of future Wonder of the Day® you’d like to visit in Wonderopolis! Please make sure you tell Ms. Croy that we said THANK YOU for introducing you and your classmates to Wonderopolis, too…we think that ROCKS!
I really do love the firework, exploding in mid-air, colors everywhere, the bigger they get, the more cool it looks. The big fireworks I love the most.
We sure do appreciate this AWESOME comment you left for us, Carlos! Your creative, descriptive words help us see fireworks in our mind’s eye! We’re glad you visited this Wonder, too! Have a WONDERful weekend!
I like fireworks, they look cool, they pop cool, and their colors are cool.
We are “oohhhhh”ing and “ahhhh”ing over your comment today, Jalen! Thanks for sharing your passion for fireworks– they are such a cool component of a big celebration! We love WONDERing about the different senses that are affected by fireworks– sight (cool colors), sound (popping) and sometimes touch (lots of clapping)! Thanks for joining us at Wonderopolis today!
I really love the video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HOORAY, we’re so excited to hear it, ViviAnne! We can’t wait until we see some fireworks this summer!

I’m ashamed to admit I was turned on by this post at the time. Who am I kidding… I still kinda am.

Photo Friday
I want to pay a tribute to my dad today.
Monday would have been his birthday.
He passed away over four years ago, but it's really still too raw for me to get into depth about. I cope through numbness.
We were very close. He called me "Bopper" or "Boppy Annie" (for awhile, my car license plate was BOPIANI).
He was kind and gentle and loving.
This photo appeared in the family Christmas card the year I was born.
I was an April baby. The only girl after three boys and an eleven year gap.
When I was a kid, he would get on his knees and serenade my friends with his beautiful voice.
I am so thankful to have had the fortune to have had him for my dad.
I miss him dearly.

That's a sweet picture and lovely post about your Dad. I had done a similar thing last week in honor of my Dad's birthday that was a sad day for me.
So sweet. What a loving tribute. I'm glad you felt up to sharing some memories of him; it means that more of us get to share your special dad.
XX' & OO's
Barb,
I, too, am an April baby. Isn't it great to be loved that much by your daddy! I, too, was a daddy's girl. He used to call me Piggy. I collect little piggies in honor of that.
Thanks for sharing about your dad. It sounds like you were very special to him.
I'm late on this, but that is certainly no excuse.
You offer just a few beautiful details, but they sum everything up; your feelings, your gratitude, your grief.

Hey there,
maybe this question is a bit obscure, but this is the third time it would be useful - might you implement the possibility to use PHP in the title?
Example: I am using the qTranslate Plugin for a Multilanguage blog - with putting
<?php if(qtrans_getLanguage()=="de") { ?> Das deutsche Widget. <?php } else { ?> The english Widget. <?php } ?>
inside the content it is possible to create multilingual widgets without even touching the theme. But with
<?php if(qtrans_getLanguage()=="de") { ?> Der deutsche Titel <?php } else { ?> The english title <?php } ?>
in the title-field it would be possible to fully internationalize Widgets without touching the theme.

all-natural, appetizers, bacon, holiday menu, holiday parties, Mushroom, party menu, Recipe, stuffed mushrooms, vegetables
I love mushrooms. But I don’t love most stuffed mushrooms. I have a problem with the consistency of the “classic version” (a paste), and if they aren’t right out of the oven, the consistency is even more troubling on its way toward cold. So I made a “unclassic”–not to be confused with unclassy–version of stuffed mushrooms. Un-blended, un-mushed, and un-pasty. Your taste buds won’t will be un-happy.
Because I originally made this appetizer for a party, and there’s quite a bit of prep work, I made more than you would need on a normal night. If you’re only serving a few people–or just yourself–you can still do the prep but only bake what you need and store the rest in the fridge. Two days later, my leftover prepped mushrooms were still just as delicious as the first day.
For serving at a party, only bake as many as will be eaten right away, then bake as needed. Note: If you use a pre-heated toaster oven, you may only need to bake them for 10 minutes…they’re done when you see sizzling juice around the mushrooms and the cheese is melted/golden. While the mushrooms are cooling, transfer them to paper towels or other material to soak up excess liquid to prevent mushiness from setting in (or juices squirting out when you take a bite!). You could also line a basket or tray with a napkin or waxed paper and serve them that way. Note for party planning: The bigger the mushrooms, the harder it is to eat in one bite, which is what you want for a finger food menu.
If you or your guests don’t eat pork, make sure you use quality thyme and add any other spices if needed to boost flavor.
Recipe for “Not Your Classic” Stuffed Mushrooms
- Yields approximately 35 stuffed mushrooms
- Prep time: 45 minutes
- Bake time: 20-25 minutes
Ingredients:
- 3 packages (8 ounces each) mushrooms – I used the button/white variety, but cremini mushrooms work too
- 2 pieces bacon, nitrate/nitrite-free
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup minced shallots (about 1 large)
- 1 heaping tablespoon minced garlic (about 2 large cloves)
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- sea salt, to taste
- freshly ground pepper, to taste
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- shaved/shredded parmesan cheese, enough for a pinch on top of each mushroom
Directions:
Fry bacon in large pan until crispy, then remove and let cool. While bacon is cooking, clean mushrooms with damp cloth. Separate mushroom stems from caps, being careful not to tear the caps. Finely chop stems. Preheat oven to 350°F. Add olive oil to bacon fat left behind from cooking and saute stems and shallots over medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring often. Add garlic, a couple pinches of salt, a few twists of pepper, and thyme, cooking for 2 more minutes. Turn off heat and stir in parsley and finely chopped bacon. Taste and add spices if necessary. Toss mushroom caps with olive oil. Use small spoon to stuff stem mixture into mushroom caps. Press curved outside of spoon down into mixture to pack in. Don’t overstuff. Top each cap with a pinch of parmesan. Bake 20-25 minutes on baking sheet. Transfer mushrooms to paper towels or cloth while cooling to soak up excess liquid.

I have not been visited by the ghosts of dead heroes, pets nor family members. The spirits apparently prefer to spend time with more interesting -- or receptive -- human beings. Therefore, adhering to this month's spooky theme has been a challenge.
My husband suggested writing about our Lhasa Apso (seen here in the most mysterious and ghostly photo I could manage) because legend has it these dogs were bred to guard Tibetan temples against evil spirits.
My dog does have an annoying habit of barking at the wind, but not strangers who come to the house. Perhaps I should give more credence to the possibility that he is preventing ghosts from calling on us. However, I have a difficult time viewing our happy-go-lucky Buddy as a ferocious guardian against otherworldly beings.
Next, I considered writing about what terrifies me, which would be things that could harm the people I love. Fellow New Hampshire author Jodi Picoult readily admits the themes of her best-selling books center around subjects that most frighten her and her hope that by addressing them in fiction, she can prevent these horrible things from happening. I do the same.
Then I gave a great deal of thought to what might frighten others and concluded the unusual thinking processes of people who enjoy writing about crime and murder might very well qualify as spine-chilling.
For example, Buddy and I sometimes take early morning walks through a wooded area and I often wonder if something, or someone, other than the usual forest creatures is watching and waiting to pounce. When the hair rises on the back of my neck, I become very aware that it would be easy for someone to attack, kill me and escape. (At just 18 pounds, Buddy isn't much protection -- remember, he only barks at the wind.) What's more, there are several locations that offer excellent opportunities to conceal a corpse. Believe me, I've looked.
I think that if other people knew how much time mystery writers spend thinking like this, they might find it ... well, unsettling, to say the least.
I can't even engage in recreational activities, such as attempting to climb a mountain with my spouse, without thoughts of murder and mayhem. As I complained to a National Forest Service official recently in an entry on my personal blog, "Because we're mystery writers, we also know that mountain trails provide optimum opportunities for serial killers and other wackos. If we could figure out that someone hiking without ski poles to defend themselves – and no emergency button to push – easily could be dragged off into the woods and murdered, so can they."
It is impossible for me to drive by an overgrown highway median, enjoy the view of a large body of water or even visit a historic fort surrounded by vegetation without thinking: "That would be a good place to hide a body." My husband and I often discuss ways to commit murder -- and not get caught. Reading the ingredients on household products can prompt musings about new opportunities to dispose of people and evidence. An intriguing news story can trigger imaginative and macabre discussions of "what if....?"
Normal people might find these traits peculiar at best -- and possibly even horrifying. But I consider them just part of "getting in the spirit." How about you?
10 comments:
You're right, Pat. You are scary.
I find myself speculating along the same lines. My non-writer friends ask, "Why would you even think of such a thing!" when I describe some clever plan for homicide.
If thoughts could manifest themselves, I suspect we'd all be dead - killed in intriguing ways, of course, with all the evidence wisely concealed.
I'm so happy we all (crime fiction writers, that is) think the same way!
My hubby told me once that I'm a very sick person. I said, "thank you." After 30 years of marriage, though, he's starting to think like me. Last year we visited a company that manufacturers log homes, and as soon as they showed us the kiln where they dry the logs, we looked at each other. A perfect place for a murder.
I think being a writer is something of a curse, because you are always thinking like a writer.
My walking partner reads a lot but she's not a writer; she's a pediatrics ICU nurse. She's patiently listened to me yammer away about writing for years. The other day, she slapped me on the arm and told me I had ruined her reading pleasure, because she was on her break at work, reading "a trashy novel" (meaning, sexy), and she realized there was no character development, which is not something she'd ever cared about before, but listening to me made her notice that and it ruined the (sexy) book for her. So now I'm in the dog house.
I was just talking to a friend the other day about someone who was annoying the heck out of us and I pointed out that I knew of many ways to kill someone and hide the body. Not that I'd ever use that knowledge for anything other than my writing, but it's somehow a comfort to know I possess such power. Heh heh. Also, it's fun to know I could make anyone who annoys me into a character in my next book and kill them off that way. Heh heh.
Ah yes. The head of a mystery writer is a scary place, indeed. We're all wired that way. And it's quite a lot of fun to go out to dinner with the Sisters in Crime and watch the faces of the other diners when someone says, "I need to get rid of this guy; you know, Susan's brother; how do you think I should do it?" and the discussion turns to committing the perfect murder, and then someone else says, "Oooh! Oooh! I just saw this great place to hide a body! Dump him there when you've killed him!" and before you know it, the police arrive.
(On another note, it's equally entertaining to go somewhere with the romance writers and watch people squirm as the discussion turns technical. The police don't get called in, although people sure do blush a lot and sometimes they leave in a hurry, too.)
Buddy looks like Zoe, my dog. I thought she was a Shih-tzu/Chihuahua mix, but maybe she's a Lhasa instead. We got her gently used, from a second owner, so no one really knows.
I enjoyed your post, Pat. I'm glad to read that I'm not alone with my thoughts.
For me, I think that a lot of it comes from my being the daughter, niece and sister of law enforcement officers and then myself being a retired agent. And add in mystery writing and reading...
We are a sick bunch, but I bet we are the sanest because we vent all this horror with like minded friends. I've lived in my moorage for almost 17 years now and I'm always staring into the water expecting to see a body. And coming home at night??? Well, it's no wonder I live with the a constant case of the chills.
A dog that barks at the wind, wow, I instantly thought of two possible paranormal stories. One would have a demon hunter moving in next door to you Pat. You are walking in the woods and you spot a great place to hide a body. Buddy starts barking and what you feel is a scary moment is in reality a time freeze--check your watch after one of these moments to see how much time has passed--because behind you a demon hunter is fighting and killing a demon and using that great place to store the demon's remains. You continue your walk believing you just had a great mystery idea. But it fades.
Patg
News stories about bodies being found always get me going. I can't help but come up with scenarios of how, who, when & why.
If I keep contemplating it, I come up with evidence left behind & who would find it & how. Next thing I know, I have a story brewing (no pun intended there - with Halloween witchery & all).
Patg - I love your thoughts on Buddy's barking at the wind.
Jennie -
If you think romance writers make folks blush, try being a lawyer in a paternity case some time! I've turned opposing counsel all shades just trying to explain in detail why their client's method of birth control doesn't really work.
It's quite a relief to have you all publicly proclaiming you've got the sickness from this genre, too. And PatG, great story idea. Thanks!!

RETHYMNO — World Indoor champion Lolo Jones, who missed out at winning a place on the American World Championships team in Berlin next month, blasted to a world-leading 12.47seconds to win the women’s 100m Hurdles at the 25th Vardinoyiannia athletics meeting in Rethymno on Monday.
Lolo Jones battling to keep her virginity
Jones’ time improved the previous 2009 world best performance of 12.52secs, achieved by Canadian Olympic bronze medallist Priscilla Lopes-Schliep.
However, she just missed the 12.43secs personal best, clocked in Beijing last summer.
Finishing behind the American was her fellow countrywoman Damu Cherry, who posted a year best of 12.53 with Jamaica’s Delloreen Ennis-London taking third, at 12.60.
On the men’s side, Olympic champion and world record holder Dayron Robles of Cuba stopped the clock at 13.17 to defeat American Dexter Faulk, who was just a step behind in 13.18.
There were some fast 100m races as well with Americans, Carmelita Jeter sizzling to an impressive 10.97 to win the women’s race and Ivory Williams improving his personal best to 9.93 to take the men’s race.
World champion over 200m, Allyson Felix finished second to Jeter in 11.08, with Stephanie Durst taking third in 11.14.
In the men’s event, American Mark Jelks was second in 10.04 with Great Britain’s Tyrone Edgar finishing third in 10.09.
Both these runners were clocking seasonal bests on the evening.
Elsewhere in the sprints, Panama’s star sprinter Alonso Edward and Jamaica’s Steve Mullings featured in an exciting men’s 200m, which just went to the Panamanian.
Edward ran a career and stadium best of 20.00seconds dead to edged Mullings, who also came home in a personal best of 20.01sec. Olympic 400m champion LaShawn Merritt finished third in 20.29. Edward time was also a national record
Bahamian veteran Debbbie Ferguson lowered the world-leading time in the women’s 200m when winning in 22.32secs.
The meeting also saw championship records from Puerto Rico’s Javier Culson and American Lashinda Demus in the men’s and women’s 400m hurdles, respectively.
Demus, highlighted as one of the athletes to beat at the world championships, raced home to 54.29 to win the women’s event over teammate and fellow Berlin bound Tiffany Williams (54.60) and Romania’s Angela Morosanu (55.32).
Culson got back to his familiar winning form with a 48.46 victory over former Olympic and world champion Felix Sanchez of Dominican Republic, who finished second in 48.96.
In the second of the two races, former world champion Bershawn Jackson clocked 48.55 to finish in front of Jamaican 2004 Athens Olympic silver medallist Danny McFarlane (48.77). Two-time Olympic champion Angelo Taylor finished down the track at position number five in a disappointing 50.72.
The field event competitions also offered some impressive standards.
Cuban world-leader Yargelis Savigne leaped 14.80m to win the women’s triple jump competition, as she continues her march towards the gold medal in Berlin.
Savigne now owns the top eight best jumps for 2009.
Her fellow teammate Mabel Gay recorded 14.44m for second place with Jamaica’s 2005 world champion Trecia Smith chalking out a last round 14.26m for third.
Cameroon’s Olympic champion Francoise Mbango continues to struggle for consistent form this season, as she finished sixth with 13.83m.
Mitchell Watt of Australia landed a new personal best of 8.43m to take the men’s long jump, improving the 8.34m he recorded earlier this season in Madrid.
Saudi Arabia’s former Asian Championships champion Hussein Taher Al-Sabee was second with 8.13m, while American Brian Johnson took third with a fourth round attempt of 8.04m.
Krisztian Pars won the men’s Hammer Throw with a last round 78.81m effort, while Gerd Kanter captured the men’s Discus with a throw of 69.10m, Barbora Spotakova won the women’s Javelin with a 62.93m mark over German rival Christina Obergfoll (61.78m) and Russian Tatyana Polnova won the women’s pole vault with a clearance of 4.56m.

This system was a disaster. No one new what questions to ask. It turned
out that the act of reading the raw data created a mental model of the
world necessary to have intelligent conversations about the data. The
system was saved by adding filters that users controlled, so they could
select a subset of the incoming traffic to read. Most selected about 10%
of the raw data. This allowed them to build the necessary mental picture
and use the system effectively.
The moral of this story is that managers who read summaries of data
prepared by those below them may need to find a way to read a subset of
the "raw" data in their organization. If they do not, they run the risk of
constructing a ever more abstract, possibly fantasy model of the world in
their mind.
Access to the raw data allows them to manage how their subordinates filter
data (filters amplify, distort, or block data) so their needs are met.
Access to raw data may allow them to recognize patterns in the world that
their filtered, summarized data would not, a cause them to change the
filters their subordinates use for them.
That is one reason I don't want a on-line newspaper tailored to my
interests. I want to see what else is there, and I want to be able to
build a model of what other people are reading so I can understand them.

> quoted quantified results. Could we have an overview of the toolset, Joan?
The tools are what a manager/executive must do to turn ordinary
people into highly motivated, committed, creative team players who
love to come to work. These tools are based on three common human
characteristics which are relevant to managing people -
1- Belief in the same good values and that their opposites are bad,
but with differing standards for each value based on experience.
Values are used to judge what occurs around us and reside in our Gut,
our good-bad compass. Values give us much the same hopes and fears,
cares and woes, and wanting to be the best at what we do. Our values
dictate our responses to others - Excusing our own poor performance
when others act in violation of our values, causing us to feel
indebted when someone treat us better than our value standards. Our
values also dictate our view of consequences, both positive and
negative.
2- Over 90% of us are closer to being externally directed conformists
(followers) than to being internally directed non-conformists. What
we follow are the value standards implied in what we experience in
the workplace. Followers waste about 60% of their productive effort
in following as compared to a non-follower who does what they believe
they should do in accordance with their own value standards.
3- Each of us has an innate ability to choose - how we act, what we
think, what we say and how we react to others and events. This power
cannot be removed by anyone although we can (as conformists have) be
almost coerced into not using this power.
These characteristics dictate that the only way to manage people is
to lead them to use high standards for all values and to become
internally directed, their natural at birth state, the way we know we
must be in our private life.
Leadership is communicating value standards to subordinates through
what they do and do not experience. Causing these experiences to lead
them to high motivation, committment, creativity, teamwork and
reliance on internal vice external direction is the best management
of human resouces. To do this, a boss must understand the values
involved and how to communicate them in the process of a normal work
day.
There are 23 values of particular concern -
- honesty, confidence and industriousness are "must have".
- positive attitude, smiles, cheers and praise, perseverance, success
and winners are the "fire in the boiler".
- compassion, humility, admission of error, fairness, forthrightness,
forgiveness, trust and courtesy are "does the boss care".
- grit and heroism are necessary to success.
- knowledge, integrity, loyalty, quality and selflessness have
special applicability to managing people.
The tools include specific actions by which to communicate these
values individually.
There are also tools and guidelines by which to reflect high
standards of all values in every aspect of support which any boss
must provide to juniors so that juniors can be successful - training,
discipline, rewards, tools, parts and material, technical advice,
planning, information, documentation, procedures, rules, coaching,
peace of mind and direction. To enhance a boss's coaching abilities,
information is included to prepare any person to cope with common
workplace conditions (bosses, peers, comradeship, bureaucracy,
change, unions, customers, priorities, competition inside,
communication, committees and discrimination) and personal behaviors
(personality, likes and dislikes, ego and prestige, assumptions, bad
morale, bad attitudes, stress and emotionalism) including a change
procedure based on how the concious brain can reprogram the
sub-concious brain's behavior.
For instance, giving orders is presented as one of the weakest and
most destructive actions a boss can take. No one likes to take orders
and too many destroys our creativity and our ability to independently
think, makes us into robots who think we are just numbers. An
Anti-Robot procedure for supervisors and higher bosses is given so as
to respect people and lead them to commitment and creativity.
The quality and standards of the support which the boss provides to
people, whether it is done directly or indirectly, are the standards
they will use in the performance of their work. Juniors are therefore
twice customers of the boss, once for the actual tool or training or
discipline and once for the standards which they reflect. This
relationship is what must dictate the boss' attitude toward other
team players. Besides, customers are always the best judges of
whether the support is good enough, timely enough or whatever.
In order to be able to find out one's leadership deficiencies as a
boss, one must be a very skillful listener. Listening is, in fact,
the door to any subordinate's commitment since a boss who listens and
provides reasonable, timely answers and actions by way of response
convinces us that we are valued members of the team. The "Don't Shoot
theMessenger" procedure and guidelines provide exactly how to
accomplish this aspect of respecting fellow members of the team.
Getting out of the office to listen to your people is important to
managing people and business and warrants specific rules and
guidelines. This is one of only two ways a boss can discover what is
wrong with support and thereby demonstrate real caring for people,
the extent of which is how much they will care about their work and
their customers.
The second way to find and correct leadership deficiencies is to hold
Group Meetings. They are five times more effective in changing
culture than one-on-one sessions as long as they are conducted for
the purpose of receiving and answering complaints, suggestions and
questions. Listening is the boss' key skill herein as he/she causes
juniors to participate in problem solving through applying common
values. This is the primary mechanism for releasing juniors from the
bondage of following to internal direction through values. There are
eleven valuable culture changing orders which become very credible in
front of a group such as "Act in accordance with your own values and
not by what you think the boss wants - be your own person and don't
waste time trying to detect my value standards or anyone else's."
There are many guidelines and rules for conducting meetings and
developing corrective actions which involve and don't deny people
team membership and reflect high standards of respect, forthrightness
and caring.
This tool set is a coherent whole wherein values are the glue. If
anyone want a little more understanding, I will email them the
article "Leadership is a Science not an- <>

What to expect:
- Beta version of the WebKit2GTK+ API
- Support for Accelerated Compositing
- WebGL enabled by default
- Support for HTML5 Fullscreen and WebAudio
- Multimedia layer ported to GStreamer 0.11
- Support for the Low-Level Interpreter in JavaScriptCore
The new Web 3.6 (Epiphany) will be using WebKit2 beta which won’t be the default choice as some functionality is still missing. Still you will be able to build Web with WebKit2 beta support and experience increased responsiveness and stability, Flash support without having to rely on nspluginwrapper and increased security.
This will work as the base to hopefully get us to version 3.8 where the Web will be using WebKit2 by default, providing the ability to render visually stunning web content in your browser, as well as enjoy more subtle improvements such as smoother animations or increased responsivenes while browsing.

Book: In the Shadow of the Banyan
Victor Frankl, as a concentration camp prisoner himself, came to understand why some people survived, others didn't, no matter their conditions. It was their will to live, their sense of purpose and self.
Vaddey Ratner, in her book "In the Shadow of the Banyan," she tells the story of the horrific Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, 1975-79. While fictional, it is in fact, Ratner's own story. Through the voice of a seven year old girl we learn of the death and destruction of people, culture, and the land itself. Her will to live, her strength in the face of starvation, deprivation extreme and loss of family bears witness to Frankl's belief.
Ratner also tells us how the regime came to power and what their objectives were through the progess of her story, which is instructive as it is the way of conflict and power worldwide. It is difficult to read of such horror, yet this book is a story of hope and it is also a piece of fine literature worthy of the praise it has received. "In the Shadow of the Banyan" is powerful, well written, and a lesson to us all.

Genre: Puzzle
Publisher: Ubisoft
Developer: Hudson
Release Date: June 21, 2005
I would love to sound like your regular “in the know” gamer and cite the titling of the new Bomberman game -- simply “Bomberman” -- as the sign of a new path for the series, a release that sets a new bar for the games that follow it, a la Resident Evil 4. Bomberman for the DS is not that game. With reality backing me up just slightly this time around, I would love to tell you that this new Bomberman game is a back to basics look at the series, a game that removes the fluff surrounding the gameplay and brings fans back to a bomb-’n-run experience. But Bomberman for the DS is not that game, either.
So what is it, then? The short answer: It’s just another Bomberman game. It does not compete with the likes of classics like Mega and Saturn Bomberman, yet it distances itself from series duds Bomberman 64 and Bomberman Generations. It brings new ideas to the table, such as the new touch screen-based revenge game, yet it leaves out many of the fun new modes introduced in Bomberman Online and Bomberman Jetters. It is Bomberman DS, not an evolution and definitely not a revolution, right along with every Bomberman game that has seen release within the past decade. It’s the same bomb-dropping concept, the same grid-based setting (barring Bomberman 64), the same mundane single player mode and the same sublime multiplayer experience.
So, to get the negative side of Bomberman out of the way, let’s hop right into the single player portion of the game. In a word: Boring. These are the portions of every game in this series that have earned the genre title “puzzle,” although only in the most loose application. The “thinking” part (which is where the puzzle genre comes in, although that is to say little of the thousands of games in existence which require the user to “think”) is in timing the bomb explosions -- which, for the uninitiated, occur moments after the bomb is placed -- with the approach of various types of enemies. Simple enough, yes?
There’s a little more to it. Each enemy type has a different raison d’etre. Some approach in specific patterns and velocities. Others float continuously through even the most solid obstacles. Still others are powerful enough to absorb strings of hits. Different approaches, often involving a hefty amount of pre-planning, are required to take down each enemy.
The problems with the single player mode all tie in to the fact that there just isn’t much to do. Nothing on the basic grid is altered adequately throughout the near one hundred levels of gameplay. While more action-packed games can easily get away with ignoring diversity for the most part, Bomberman’s slow-paced nature makes the repitition far too obvious.
But make no mistake: Bomberman only carries snail-like pace when the DS download play features aren’t being taken advantage of. Single player is tedious, but multiplayer gamers are anything but.
The action moves with blinstering speed. The name of the game is straight-up deathmatch -- blow up every enemy bomber in your path and be the last man standing, Highlander style. While the inhibiting blocks that initially surround every combatant keep the initial moments of each match fairly tame, don’t be fooled; things are about to get crazy.
Most times, it is only seconds before the literal heat is on. Hordes of items throughout each stage lend impressive item upgrades -- and, for the crafty player, downgrades -- to specific aspects of the bombermen: Bomb type (bouncy, landmine, power), bomb strength (long, longer, and even freakin’ longer), running speed, and abilities (punch, kick, throw). During eight player matches, despite the added room thanks to two full screens of action, flames undoubtedly end up hosing down the majority of the breakable obstacles on any given map in no time at all.
Added bells and whistles tie up the essence of Bomberman DS neatly: Voice-activated shields and bomb-detonations add a surprising about of charm to the experience, as long as enough players are present for the fun. The manual instructs players to yell specific silly phrases like “ka-BOOM!!!” to activate voice functions, but in reality, just about any loud noise close to the microphone works like a charm. Best of all, voice modes, like Donkey Konga’s clap-sensing microphone, are protected by variable sensitivity options. My playtest: Loud blasts from those annoying party trumpet/noisemaker trinkets. If it worked for us, it can work for you, too! When they ask, tell your friends you heard of this idea on WorthPlaying.com! (Wink.)
While not as exciting as gleefully screaming your personal choice for hottest young actor of the year, the DS’s native touch screen also adds a dose of gimmick-y joy. Instead of the traditional “lobbin’ carts” of ye olde Bomberman, players must gauge the frequency and length of touch screen flicks in order to propell bombs across one or both screens. While this mode is strategically lacking, as the flick speed is very shaky, it is a welcome change to the traditional revenge mode. Even after all these years, there still isn’t a better gaming moment in the world than taking out another player during revenge, being ressurrected because of it, and subsequently winning the game.
Most of what makes up Bomberman DS’s multiplayer mode is nearly perfect, part by part. The problem is what’s missing. As per the How To Make A Bomberman Game Official Rule Book, this newest Bomberman must completely ignore any steps forward made by any Bomberman game prior to or after the release of the former said game. That means no submarine bomber, Chu Chu Rocket-style modes, rideable animals, online play (though, to be fair, this is because the game is releasing months before Nintendo plans to unveil the DS’s online infastructure), almost nothing. Eight player Bomberman almost graces Saturn Bomberman levels of fun (10-player widescreen mode!), but without the added extras that made that game so close to complete genre perfection (if you consider Bomberman games to be a genre unto themselves), this DS rendition is nowhere near being the classic that that game was.
Every Bomberman review -- even the one I would have written for Saturn Bomberman, had I been given the chance to review it upon release -- has felt dated. The difference is, while the luster of Saturn Bomberman has only grown when compared to the titles following it, no game in the series has managed to maintain the same image, with the Dreamcast’s Bomberman Online being the strongest challenger..
Score: 6.7/10

How long should I wait after logging out before I hit the Back and Quit buttons? I have a lot of addons and sometimes 3-4 minutes later the hard drive is still going nuts writing. I'm asking because, sometimes, if I'm in a hurry, it completely locks up if I don't wait long enough.

I always just hit the X or Alt+F4 for a quick log off. The game will still stay open for a few seconds while it does what it needs too. I've never lost any addon data doing that, that I know of. It's never 3-4 minutes though.

Given so much of Warcraft lore is about corruption (orcs, illidan, death wing, arthas [by the runeblade] etc.) it's fitting that the Old Gods were a source of what is frankly mental illness. It's also fitting that this problem endures. Like happiness and liberty, these problems will continue to plague humanity (azerothity?) for eons.
Even without the Old Gods, there would be the problems of the Old Gods

Fast BuddyPress Development
Working with BuddyPress on top of WordPress is a super exciting thing, it adds a whole new dimension to the platform and really demonstrates huge potential.
BuddyPress like other plugins expands on the core functionality WordPress offers. Although it is important as a freelancer or company to recognise that BuddyPress unlike other plugins adds functionality of epic proportions.
This tutorial aims to show you how to demonstrate a proof of concept quickly and functionally without making any best practice cardinal sins.
Introduction
Over the course of this tutorial we will use a combination of PHP, jQuery and WordPress functions to extend BuddyPress far enough to demonstrate a concept.
Working on member profiles we will without any recourse add a link that allows users to visit a member bookmarks area.
The bookmarks area will be populated with a list of bookmarks a member has decided to save whilst browsing any BuddyPress enabled site.
The scope of bookmarks which can be saved will only be applied to WordPress posts for now, however you may look to build on this further and apply it to other areas of a WordPress powered web site that produces a permalink.
Step 1 The Essentials
We will be building upon the bp-default theme today and creating our own child theme. Below is the structure you should have created.
- style.css – Some additional styles for icons, buttons and lists (this will not be discussed).
- sidebar.php – We will call our widget from here.
- header.php – One modification required.
- functions.php – Register scripts and a apply a filter.
- _inc/img/ – A number of image files to be used.
- _inc/js/bookmarks.js – jQuery and AJAX.
- members/single/home.php – Some PHP logic to enable the template loader.
- members/single/bookmarks/ajax.php – Used for our AJAX calls.
- members/single/bookmarks/loop.php – Retrieval of bookmarks via member profiles.
- members/single/bookmarks/remove.php – Deletion of bookmarks via my member profile.
- members/single/bookmarks/save.php – Storage of bookmarks via my member profile.
- members/single/bookmarks/view.php – Hacky bookmark template loader.
- members/single/bookmarks/widget.php – Called into site sidebar.php.
style.css – Within style.css we need a bare minimum amount of code to allow for theme selection via wp-admin. Let’s do that now.
/* Theme Name: Bookmark theme Description: Child theme from bp-default with added support for member bookmarks. Version: 1.0 Author: WPTuts Author URI: Tags: buddypress Template: bp-default */
Tags: buddypress will notify BuddyPress that we are using a BP enabled theme.
Template: bp-default will instruct BuddyPress that when this theme is active to inherit its functionality from the bp-default theme unless a theme file has been modified.
Within sidebar.php we need to load the widget.php.
locate_template(array('members/single/bookmarks/widget.php'), true);
Step 2 functions.php – Register Script
Let’s go ahead and register the bookmarks.js file, it will be required on every page from here on out. In functions.php add the following.
function px_bookmark_scripts() if(!is_admin()) wp_enqueue_script( 'px-scripts-functions', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/_inc/js/bookmarks.js', array('jquery'), '1.0', true ); } add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts','px_bookmark_scripts');
wp_enqueue_script accepts 5 parameters.
- Handle – Give your script a name.
- Source – Path to your script.
- Dependencies – Which scripts will your script need to function.
- Version – Version number of your script.
- In footer – If false your script will be loaded with
wp_head. If set to true it will load with
wp_footer.
Browsers of our site will be able to add or remove a WordPress post to their bookmarks by clicking an anchor which reads “Add to bookmarks” or “Remove from bookmarks” located to the bottom of each post.
When either anchor is clicked we will use AJAX and make a request to a PHP script. Once executed we will update the sidebar widget.
Should the browser be logged in as a member of the site they can then save any “Lists of bookmarks” which are currently stored within the session and displayed in the widget.
functions.php…
function px_bookmark_link() global $post; if(@in_array($post->ID, $_SESSION['bookmarks'])) : $content .= 'Remove from bookmarks'; else : $content .= 'Add to bookmarks'; endif; return $content; add_filter('the_tags', 'px_bookmark_link');
This function is called at each iteration of “the loop” by utilising
add_filter and
the_tags as our hook.
We let WordPress know that within this function we want access to items within
$wp_query and consequently
$post. This will allow us to retrieve
the_id,
the_title and
the_permalink.
Some logic is applied when this code executes to determine which link to show. If the user already has the item within their current session we will show a “Remove from bookmarks” anchor and vice versa.
in_array() allows us to check this.
in_array() will flag notices if
error_reporting has that directive, we use the
@ symbol to suppress these notices (hacky).
Using the data returned in
$post we form two anchors for adding and removing bookmarks (all
data attributes important here) to be later used with our AJAX calls in bookmarks.js.
For a full reference of available filters visit the codex.
Step 3 Widget – Proof of Concept
Now we have our link in place let’s create the widget which will appear in the sidebar at all times and will be populated or emptied on demand.
The image above reflects the final states of the widget in 3 scenarios.
- No bookmarks whilst being logged in or logged out.
- Bookmarks currently saved in session whilst not logged in.
- Bookmarks currently saved in session whilst being logged in.
The next block of code is placed within widget.php and nested within HTML markup.
if($_SESSION['bookmarks']) : foreach($_SESSION['bookmarks'] as $key => $value) : $keys[] = $key; $start_count = min($keys); endforeach; endif; for($i = $start_count; $i < $start_count + count($_SESSION['bookmarks']); $i++) : if($_SESSION['bookmarks'][$i]) : $bookmark = get_post($_SESSION['bookmarks'][$i]); echo '
When building this project there was a problem with session data that kept cropping up upon output. Some values were being removed but the key was persisting. Setting a
$start_count later to be used when printing the session data solved this problem.
The important thing to note here is how to retrieve items from
$_SESSION['bookmarks'] which will be created in the next stage.
At each iteration we use
get_post() to query the WordPress database with the stored integer values in
$_SESSION['bookmarks']. Which will return all the human readable data we need.
if(is_user_logged_in()) : // Show SAVE button else : // Show "LOGIN TO SAVE" message. endif; if($_SESSION['bookmarks']) : // Show CLEAR button endif;
This final piece of logic within widget.php determines which buttons and text to show alongside the widget depending on the state of the current session and
also if the user is logged in or out.
Step 4 Adding Bookmarks via AJAX
jQuery is awesome, here we’ll use the
delegate method and listen for clicks on our important anchors. We’ll check for the following items being clicked.
- Anchors with a class of
add-bookmark
- Anchors with a class of
delete-bookmark
- Anchors with a class of
clear-bookmarks
Using
hasClass we can test which item has been clicked within the delegate method and serve the desired
AJAX call.
Should you be building this into a larger project please consider using a pubsub pattern.
var $bookmark_widget = $('#px-bookmarks'), $bookmark_form = $('#px-bookmarks form'), $bookmark_widget_list = $('#px-bookmarks .current-bookmarks'), $empty_widget = $('#px-bookmarks p'), $widget_buttons = $('#px-bookmarks .widget-buttons'), $login_notify = $('#px-bookmarks .login-notify'), // This should be changed to reflect your domain. $ajax_path = '';
First log some variables so we are not “splashing around in the DOM” too much. All DOM selectors above are located within widget.php.
$(".add-bookmark, .delete-bookmark, .clear-bookmarks").delegate(this, 'click', function(e) e.preventDefault(); );
We tell jQuery to listen for click on all of the listed classes and via the callback function we will then tell it what to do. The next portions of code to be added will be placed directly after
e.preventDefault().
Using
preventDefault() is a smarter way of nullifying the default action when JavaScript is present. Here is some discussion surrounding
preventDefault() on Stack Overflow.
The next portions of code to be added will be placed directly after
e.preventDefault().
var $post_id = $(this).data('post-id'), $post_name = $(this).data('post-name'), $post_href = $(this).attr('href'), $that = $(this);
Once a user has clicked any of the “important anchors” we need to store the data attribute values which were attached to anchors in Step 2. This will allow us to send and retrieve the data we want.
The next code can become a little verbose as we will be showing and hiding elements based on which item has been clicked, with that pre-cursor the code below is the
bare minimum which will function without aesthetics in mind. However please do download the source and look to these lines.
if($that.hasClass('add-bookmark')) $.ajax( url: $ajax_path + '?method=add', type: 'GET', data: 'post_id=' + $post_id, success: function(returndata) if($bookmark_widget_list.children().length === 0) // Show / hide $bookmark_widget_list.prepend('
Here we use
hasClass to distinguish which item was clicked by using jQuery to search against our clicked item.
Based on the outcome we setup our
AJAX call a little bit differently each time. With the
url and
data being requested and sent each time changing slightly.
Notice
?method=add appended to
$ajax_path. This is the equivalent of.
When adding a bookmark to the current session the only item we need to pass to our PHP code is the id of that post which was stored into the
$post_id variable.
When jQuery receives a successful response we then append that item to the current bookmark list within the widget area as a list item. Using
$post_id,
$post_name and
$post_href here.
When the page is refreshed the code added to widget.php in step 3 will kick in.
On line 7 of the last snippet there is a small subroutine within the
success method which determines if there are any list items present within the widget area. This is the previously-mentioned-slightly-verbose code which does nothing more than show and hide some DOM elements. It has been removed for readability here on Wptuts+. Moving on…
if($that.hasClass('delete-bookmark')) $.ajax( url: $ajax_path + '?method=delete', type: 'GET', data: 'post_id=' + $post_id, success: function(returndata) if($bookmark_widget_list.children().length <= 1) // Show / hide $('#bookmark-'+ $post_id).remove(); } }); }
Much like
if($that.hasClass('add-bookmark')) here we check for items clicked that have the class of
delete-bookmark.
Once this subroutine has been entered the
url in the AJAX call is altered slightly by sending over a different query string. Namely
?method=delete.
When a successful response is returned we remove that list item from the current bookmarks stored within the widget.
Applying some logic in the same fashion as the
add-bookmark subroutine to determine if the item removed is going to be the final item. Based on this outcome here DOM elements are again shown or hidden.
if($that.hasClass('clear-bookmarks')) $.ajax( url: $ajax_path + '?method=clear', success: function(returndata) // Show / hide $('.postmetadata .delete-bookmark').each(function(index) // Bookmark list cleared, set anchors attached to posts to default. $(this).removeClass().addClass('add-bookmark').html('Add to bookmarks'); ); } }); }
The final code snippet here is used to clear all bookmarks within the widget by setting the
url query string to a different method and resetting any anchors on the page to the default "Add to bookmarks" to reflect an empty
$_SESSION. This is done by utilising jQuery's
each method to find all occurrences of the class
delete-bookmark (anchor attached to posts using
add_filter) and switching it back to the default
add-bookmark.
Step 5 PHP Requested via AJAX
Now we will create the PHP code referenced in the AJAX calls above which will be used to add, delete and clear all bookmarks from the session.
Within ajax.php we will create the following 3 functions.
add_bookmark()
delete_bookmark()
clear_bookmarks()
Let's first create
add_bookmark()
function add_bookmark() $post_id = $_GET['post_id']; if(@!in_array($post_id, $_SESSION['bookmarks'])) : $_SESSION['bookmarks'][] = $post_id; endif;
First we store the
$post_id previously passed over in bookmarks.js via
data: 'post_id=' + $post_id.
Next we use the
in_array function again to determine if this item should be added to the bookmarks session.
function delete_bookmark() $post_id = $_GET['post_id']; foreach($_SESSION['bookmarks'] as $key => $value) : $keys[] = $key; endforeach; $start_count = min($keys); if(@in_array($post_id, $_SESSION['bookmarks'])) : for($i = $start_count; $i < $start_count + count($_SESSION['bookmarks']); $i++) : if($_SESSION['bookmarks'][$i] === $post_id) : unset($_SESSION['bookmarks'][$i]); endif; endfor; endif;
Within the
delete_bookmark() function we again store the
$post_id.
Using the same technique to output our bookmarks in widget.php a
$start_count is established.
Next we determine if the item passed (
$post_id) exists within the bookmarks session via
in_array, and unset any values that are matched.
function clear_bookmark() session_start(); session_unset(); session_destroy();
Finally the
clear_bookmark() function destroys all session data.
We will need one more piece of code for this file to be complete. Head to the top of the file and add the following.
session_start(); $method = $_GET['method']; switch($method) case "add" : add_bookmark(); break; case "delete" : delete_bookmark(); break; case "clear" : clear_bookmark(); break;
We use
session_start() to resume the current session. This is crucial here.
Next we store the method which is sent over with
url in our
$.ajax calls.
Based on the current value of
$method we call the appropriate function.
Step 6 Bookmarks on Members Profiles
The files we will be dealing with for the remainder of this tutorial are listed below.
- members/single/home.php – This file is a modified version of bp-default/members/single/home.php.
- members/single/bookmarks/loop.php – Used to retrieve any previously saved member bookmark lists.
- members/single/bookmarks/remove.php – Used to delete any saved bookmark lists.
- members/single/bookmarks/save.php – Used to save any bookmark lists stored within the current session.
- members/single/bookmarks/view.php – Used as a makeshift template loader.
Inside home.php we will add a list item to the unordered list within the div with an id of
item-nav.
Using the
$bp global we can quickly form the URL required.
global $bp; echo '
This is one of smaller sins we make along the road to demonstrate proof of concept. However to re-iterate proof-of-concept and speedy development is the important factor here.
Should we decide to expand this feature more we would look to using BuddyPress hooks.
if($_GET['component'] == 'bookmarks') : locate_template(array('members/single/bookmarks/view.php'), true);
Still within home.php we check against the query string which will allow us to serve custom templates.
if(!$_GET['action']) : locate_template(array( 'members/single/bookmarks/loop.php'), true); elseif($_GET['action'] == 'save' && is_user_logged_in() && bp_is_home()) : locate_template(array( 'members/single/bookmarks/save.php'), true); elseif($_GET['action'] == 'remove' && is_user_logged_in() && bp_is_home()) : locate_template(array( 'members/single/bookmarks/remove.php' ), true); endif;
Within view.php (our make-shift template loader) we check for 2 actions and if none has been defined we show the list of saved bookmarks.
Back in step 3 some logic was added to determine which anchors to show within the widget based on the current state of
$_SESSION['bookmarks'] and whether or not the user was logged in.
Let's create a small table in the database which will be used to store a list of bookmarks which correspond to each member.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `bookmarks`; CREATE TABLE `bookmarks` ( `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL, `created` date NOT NULL, `post_ids` text NOT NULL, `list_name` text NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) )
The MySQL above will create a new table with 5 fields for us to store bookmark data.
Once created it's time to move into save.php.
Whilst the user is accessing save.php we will present a form with a text input, here the user will be required to give a label to the list of bookmarks he or she would like to save.
Once a label has been provided we will store each bookmark list as a row within the database (for later retrieval) and clear the current session.
if(!$_POST['px-bookmark-list-name']) : // Present form asking to give list a name // Stage 1 elseif($_POST['px-bookmark-list-name']) : // Label supplied store to database. // Stage 2 endif;
Now within stage 1 of save.php...
// If form submitted but no label supplied present error. if($_POST['submit'] && !isset($_POST['px-bookmark-list-name'])) : echo '
A label is required.'; endif; // Establish the start counter if($_SESSION['bookmarks']) : foreach($_SESSION['bookmarks'] as $key => $value) : $keys[] = $key; endforeach; $start_count = min($keys); endif; // Loop over items and store in hidden form fields. for($i = $start_count; $i < $start_count + count($_SESSION['bookmarks']); $i++) : if($_SESSION['bookmarks'][$i] !== NULL) : $bookmark = get_post($_SESSION['bookmarks'][$i]); echo ''; echo ''; echo ''; echo ''; endif; endfor;
First we display an error if no label has been supplied.
Next we use the same technique from widget.php and ajax.php to establish a start counter and iterate over the session data.
Finally we output some form fields with the help of
get_post.
global $bp; foreach($_POST['px-post-id'] as $value) : $posts_to_save[] = $value; endforeach; $posts = serialize($posts_to_save);
During stage 2 of save.php we gain access to the
$bp global.
We loop over the
$_POST data and store posts to be saved as an array. This is then serialized and stored into the
$posts variable.
$list_name = $_POST['px-bookmark-list-name']; $query = $wpdb->insert( 'bookmarks', array( 'user_id' => $bp->loggedin_user->id, 'created' => current_time('mysql'), 'post_ids' => $posts, 'list_name' => $list_name ), array( '%d', // user_id '%s', // created '%s', // post_ids '%s' // list_name ) );
Next we store the label supplied by the user for this bookmark list into a variable and utilise
WPDB to insert the row to the database.
if($query) : echo ''; echo ''; session_start(); session_unset(); session_destroy(); else : echo '
List saved.'; echo ''; echo ''; endif;
There was an error.'; echo '
Finally we check if the query was successful and unset session data, otherwise display an error.
Step 7 Retrieving and Deleting Bookmarks
Remember, in view.php when no particular
action is set we will load loop.php. In this file
$wpdb will be used to retrieve and output any bookmarks lists.
global $bp; $displayed_user = $bp->displayed_user->id; $bookmark_lists = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM bookmarks WHERE user_id = $displayed_user ORDER BY id DESC");
Using the
$bp global the id of the profile being displayed is stored into the
$displayed_user variable.
Next we perform a query against the bookmarks table with the stored
$displayed_user as a where condition.
if($bookmark_lists) : foreach($bookmark_lists as $bookmark_list) : echo $bookmark_list->list_name; $post_ids = unserialize($bookmark_list->post_ids); foreach($post_ids as $post_id) : $bookmark = get_post($post_id); echo ''.$bookmark->post_title.''; endforeach; endforeach; endif;
When results are returned they are displayed by looping over the data and outputting accordingly. Here we make use of
unserialize to reverse the effects of
serialize which was used to store bookmarks previously.
We can make one more addition to the previous block of code.
if(is_user_logged_in() && bp_is_home()) : echo 'Delete list'; endif;
This will add an anchor to the title of each list which when clicked will pass a new action of
remove along with the bookmark list id.
Which leads us to our final stage... Deleting a bookmark list. Open up remove.php and let's finish this off.
if(isset($_GET['action']) == 'remove' && isset($_GET['id'])) : $list_id = $_GET['id']; global $bp; $user_id = $bp->loggedin_user->id; $query = $wpdb->query("DELETE FROM bookmarks WHERE id = $list_id AND user_id = $user_id"); if($query) : echo ''; echo ''; else : echo '
List deleted.'; echo ''; echo ''; endif; endif;
There was an error.'; echo '
First we make sure the action is set to remove and there is an id to build a small query with.
Next we store some user data and run the query. Users should only be able to delete lists that belong to them, using
$bp->loggedin_user->id helps us achieve this.
Finally we serve a message depending on the outcome.
Conclusion
Over the course of this tutorial a number of techniques have been applied. Using jQuery, raw PHP, WordPress conventions and BuddyPress we have been able to illustrate a nice feature to be added to your social network site powered by WordPress and BuddyPress.
Out of the box BuddyPress does not come with a bookmarks manager attached to member profiles and there isn't a plugin out there that functions exactly like this.
A bookmarks manager is one example but this could be anything.
The main goal of this tutorial was to illustrate how quickly and effectively you can hi-jack BuddyPress to demonstrate proof of concept.
With some know-how this could be put together in an evening with little trouble at all. The time commitment is tangible and could be factored into a monthly maintenance contract.
However if a client desired more features from the bookmarks manager such as a dashboard widget and more in-depth features you would be stepping into the realms of a plugin.
Data has not been sanitised in this tutorial so please make sure if you are to place this into a "real world" environment, go through a little bit of validation before-hand.
I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial and any discrepancies you may find please do leave a comment and will do my best to help you through it.

by Samantha GellarValtrex For Sale, I’m known for my mistakes, but this one is definitely one of the worst. It was a mistake. There was no malicious intent. Valtrex paypal, In fact, if it had been during a Christmas party, everyone would have written it off as drunken hijinks. Let it go, Valtrex us.
But it was mid-February, and everyone knows he hates those Christmas parties anyways…makes himself too busy during that season, Valtrex For Sale. No, it was about the twelfth, Valtrex ebay, nearing the day when all hell breaks loose and accompanies chocolate in a winding spiral of love, hate and disappointment and I managed to really screw up.
I’d come by that afternoon just to catch up. He’d wrapped up his yearly December overload, 10mg Valtrex, I was gearing up for my next big project, and we had a habit of sharing some coffee, Valtrex craiglist, sitting by the fire and trading war stories about the market, the customers, the constant grind.
He’d been fighting with the wife again, Valtrex usa, complaints about the cold climate. Valtrex For Sale, She’d been pushing for a move for decades. I should have known better than to match the two of them up…cold and warm. 500mg Valtrex, She said she ached, that old age was making her bones hurt, that the marrow froze on the bad nights and one day she might up and die and where would he be without the cook, maid and nurse she’d become over the years, Valtrex australia. I could see the bickering was getting to him. The deep laugh lines that crow-footed the corners of his eyes were rapidly being matched with a furrow on the upper brow, 100mg Valtrex, a valley that appeared when he discussed her. Not to mention the dark circles now complementing his generally cheery eyes, Valtrex For Sale. He seemed to be fading, darkening, as if someone was sapping away what he once had, Valtrex japan.
I can’t blame her. It seems they met eons ago, Valtrex coupon, the two of them never knowing anyone else. Never having anyone but each other. Valtrex For Sale, Aside from his work, they lead an isolated life. The house was miles away from others, the estate massive but barren, 150mg Valtrex. The animals and staff there small solace for people so grand, so generally full of life. Valtrex mexico, “Chris, you gotta pull this together,” I said to him, “You’re not playing around with a bunch of self-centered adults here like I do, Valtrex india, you’ve got tons of kids depending on you.” Back when we’d started our careers, I’d made sure that I got one that dealt solely with those over legal age. 30mg Valtrex, I hated the responsibility of children, even though I was the youngest of the bunch of us, I couldn’t stand that overbearing weight, that need to constantly remain positive, Valtrex canada. I like playing mean tricks on my clientele, Valtrex For Sale. I like that I rarely feel guilty when I make them cry. I’ve never shed a tear when someone lost it and offed themselves thanks to an unexpected twist of my handiwork. 200mg Valtrex, Perhaps it was that mean nature of mine that got the best of me, maybe it was just wanting to see him happier, maybe it was just impulsivity, but when that employee, 750mg Valtrex, that short sweet thing of his came in with those rounded hips and a damned cute uniform on, I just thought Maybe I’ll give Chris a break. 40mg Valtrex, I don’t know why, I just did. Valtrex For Sale, I encouraged it. Hell, I made it happen, Valtrex uk. Lined the two of them up, aimed and shot them straight through. Valtrex overseas, One of my best point blank shots in my life.
There’s some things you can’t fight, and my arrows, they’re just one of them, 50mg Valtrex. Look at the disasters I’ve created: Antony and Cleopatra, Romeo and Juliet, Kennedy and Monroe, Valtrex For Sale. Giant messes. Every last one. 1000mg Valtrex, I swear, I’m the only one of us allowed a less than 50% success rate. See Bunny screw up one out of every two times and her candy ass is fired. Valtrex For Sale, Me, I’ve never even been reprimanded until now. Brought up in front of the entire panel, 20mg Valtrex, charged with reckless endangerment…wasn’t my fault that Ms. Klaus gets home just as Chris Kringle’s climbing offa his newfound love elf. 250mg Valtrex, Shit, I tried to separate them, but that arrow. Straight through.
She grabs the rifle they keep for protection, Valtrex For Sale. Now there’s a dead elf from accounting and Chris is in ICU and it’s mid-July and they say if he isn’t better by the Christmas rush I’m getting dressed in a fat suit. It was a mistake. Honest. They just shouldn’t give the job of Cupid to a kid with no impulse control.

The Illinois Fighting Illini will play Wake Forest in the women’s ACC/Big Ten Challenge. Last season, the Illini defeated the Clemson Tigers 61-50 in the women’s ACC/Big Ten Challenge.
According to fightingillini.com, “Illinois head coach Matt Bollant is 3-0 against the ACC with all three meetings coming as the head coach of Green Bay.”
Wake Forest had an ACC conference record of 7-9 last season. Their overall record was 20-14.
Mar 2, 2012; Greensboro, NC, USA; Wake Forest Demon Deacons players including guard Millesa Calicott (15) and forward Dearica Hamby (25) celebrate after beating the Miami Hurricanes 81-74 in their quarterfinal game of the 2012 Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament at the Greensboro Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Mark Dolejs-US PRESSWIRE
This season, the Demon Deacons are led on offense by senior guard Lakevia Boykin and junior guard Chelsea Douglas. Both Boykin and Douglas are averaging double-digit points. Douglas is averaging 13.0 points per game while Boykin is averaging 11.7 points per game. As a team, the Demon Deacons are averaging 58.8 points per game.
Just like the men’s basketball team experienced in their ACC/Big Ten challenge game, Wake Forest looks to be a “rebound by committee” kind of team. They have four players averaging five or more rebounds per game.
These four players are senior forward Mykala Walker (5.5), sophomore forward Dearica Hamby (5.7), senior center Sandra Garcia (5.2), and senior guard Asia Williams (5.0). Expect all of these players to get after the broads for Wake Forest in this game.
This will be the second meeting between the Fighting Illini and the Demon Deacons. Illinois currently leads the series 1-0.
Illinois last met Wake Forest on December 2nd, 2009. The Illini overcame a 17-point second-half deficit and won 65-50.
If Illinois wants to win this game, their offense will need to stay hot. They are averaging 75.2 points per game this season and are ranked 33rd in the country. The Illini will need to get big offensive output from junior guard Amber Moore (14.0 points per game), sophomore guard Ivory Crawford (15.6 points per game), and senior forward Karisma Penn (18.4 points per game).

Wow! What a tough life at boot camp! Getting yelled at while eating! Good grief!!! I wish your son all the best!!!!.
Take care
x
I wouldn't really want to be going through that sort of camp! Shouted at while eating . . . I knew Marines went through a lot, but geez!
There's just something about letters that's different from an electronic message. It's more personal, and they're not stored in the cloud somewhere.
I'm here as a part of Theresa's Halloween Haunting! :)
I have heard about boot camp. But, Wow! That is tough. I send best wishes to your son.
Many, Many years ago, I used to write letters, too bad it is a dying art, it is so personal and I always felt closer to the person when I read them.
I'm hear as a part of Theresa's Halloween Haunting!
oh the poor dear, Is mom allowed to send him a batch of homemade cookies?.
Your poor son! I am shocked that the recruits get shouted at while eating. How you must treasure his letters!
Christine, That is awesome that you still write letters.
Joanna, No packages allowed! But he said he's getting lots of pudding, so he likes that.
Choices, I used to write them too, which is why I guess the idea is nostalgic. Then years later, the friends or family members would give them back to me so I'd have a record, which is really a wonderful gift.
The Golden Eagle, Welcome! "stored in the cloud somewhere" LOL.
Kitty, how wonderful that you have those letters from the past!
Boo! I came over from Theresa's Haunting Halloween post. I look forward to reading more of your blog...I am big on memoirs too!
All my best wishes to your son. Praying for him. Boot camp is AWFUL! :)
I am following from Theresa's Halloween Haunting. Love your blog. :)
I'm following you from Theresa's haunting too.
I like your blog and as a mail delivery man I lament the demise of personal letters too.
My delivery bags are now filled with magazines and junk mail which nobody wants,letter writing is becoming a dying art so its good to find people keeping it alive :)
I love writing letters, too! My Mom and I wrote to each other, every week of the 20 years that I lived in Maryland. I still have all of them, hers and mine, and treasure them, as they are a record of our lives, during that time.
These letters from your son are priceless! I must say that boot camp doesn't sound like much fun, though. Wishing him all the best in a difficult situation!

Here we go again! One of my favorite (and by favorite I mean least-favorite) things the big ole Hollywood machine can do: sequelize and franchise everything. And since The Weinstein Company and Miramax penned a deal allowing them to do such a thing back in 2010, no movie is safe. You might've thought ""eh, we're nearly three years out from that deal: [insert favorite movie here] is probably safe."" And well, we hate to break it to you, but you might've thought wrong.
Because here comes the sequel you maybe forgot you wanted (or possibly don't!): Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The acclaimed 2000 Chinese film picked up a bevy of awards (I believe the technical term is ""all of the awards, ever, jeez"") when the Ang Lee made its way into the hearts and theaters of critics everywhere. So it's no surprise that Harvey and friends would want to capitalize on that sort of success, but, ugh, do we have to? Whatever happend to leaving well enough alone?
It seems as though Weinstein and Sony don't particularly care either way, as Deadline is reporting that filming is already slated to begin in May. The film, based on a series of books by the author Du Lu Wang more commonly known as the Crane-Iron Series (of which there are five), will continue to be set in Asia. As for the story? Well, the project already has a script from John Fusco and is courting director Ronny Yu to helm the production, said to be based on the series' fifth book Iron Knight, Silver Vase. It will continue to revolve around the character Yu Shu Lien (originated by Michelle Yeoh), and while it's not clear which actors will reprise roles, some are expected to do just that. ""This introduces a new generation of star-crossed lovers, and a new series of antagonists in a battle of good and evil. ... I found characters from the second and third books in the series to create a most interesting stew while being as true to the source material as I could be,"" explained Fusco.
No word on if the sequel will be titled Pouncing Tiger, Visible Dragon, but there's always hope.
What do you think of the sequel news? Excited or over it? Sound off in the comments below!

WASHINGTON - Few movies jack me up like "Alien" (1979), combining the best tagline in movie history -- "In space, no one can hear you scream" -- with a classic monster in the house design for cinema's most terrifying monster. What's scarier than an alien life form that straps itself to your face, inserts its genitalia down your throat and impregnates you with offspring that hatches out of your chest?
"It solves the ultimate problem of the haunted house," said movie critic Maitland McDonagh. "Why don't the people just get out of the house? In 'Alien,' there's no where to go."
Ridley Scott's space shocker reinvented science fiction as much as his dystopian urban follow up "Blade Runner" (1982). Ironically, Scott abandoned the genre for the last three decades to dabble in others: the buddy flick ("Thelma and Louise"), the sword-and-sandal epic ("Gladiator"), the action war flick ("Black Hawk Down") and the gangster picture ("American Gangster"). Now 30 years later, he returns to his genre wheelhouse, and the result is well worth the wait.
"Prometheus" is less a prequel about the origins of "Alien" as it is a quasi- related meditation on the origins of mankind. You won't find Ellen Ripley, the starship Nostromo or H.R. Giger's iconic alien creature (or will you?).
"The alien had its run, but you can't see that guy again," Scott told USA TODAY. "He's no longer frightening. Iconic, but too familiar."
Instead, we get a new team of explorers in the year 2089. Infertile archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Naomi Rapace, the original "Girl with the Dragon Tattoo") and her lover Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover an earthly clue to the origins of mankind and embark on a mission to find who or what planted it there. They board the spaceship Prometheus, led by strict mission manager Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), a smooth pilot with a Stephen Stills accordion (Idris Elba) and the multi-lingual android Dave, played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender, who looks like "Lawrence of Arabia" and talks like HAL 9000.
Like the best science fiction, the conflict is sparked by mankind's overreach. As Dr. Frankenstein said, "As God as my witness, now I know what it's like to be God." Hence the name "Prometheus," which was the name of the Greek God who paid a price for trying to bring mortals up to the level of the gods.
Just as these humans are trying to meet their maker, Dave the android yearns to outsmart his. This conversation unfolds between Dave and Charlie over a billiard table where Dave asks, "Why do you think your people made me?" Charlie responds, "We made you 'cause we could," to which Dave responds, "Can you imagine how disappointing it would be for you to hear the same thing?"
"Prometheus" tries to answer this age old question with a commentary on faith. We see Shaw's cryogenic dreams of her Christian childhood, then we see Dave remove her crucifix necklace, only for her to later replace it. When Charlie says the discovery of alien DNA disproves her beliefs, she simply responds, "But who made them?" Dave is dumbfounded: "After all this, you still believe?"
Ultimately, Scott says none of us truly knows the answer, and we choose to believe what we want to believe. We choose to make a leap of faith. All the while, he purposefully places a Christmas tree blinking in the background, moments before a "supernatural" birth.
Such symbolic mise-en-scene (the placement of all elements in the frame) highlights why Scott is a respected director. The franchise has been blessed with some very talented filmmakers -- James Cameron ("Titanic") in "Aliens" (1986), David Fincher ("Fight Club") in "Alien 3" (1992) and Jean-Pierre Jeunet ("Amelie) in "Alien: Resurrection" (1997). But after the abominations of "Alien vs. Predator" (2004) and "Alien vs. Predator: Requiem" (2007), it's great having the original visionary back in the director's chair.
Scott knows how to create gorgeous compositions, and the carefully composed set pieces remind me of Kubrick's best futuristic designs. Dare I say "Prometheus" is the most visually stunning movie Scott has yet done? Such rich cinematic spaces become all the more impressive when they eventually become covered in blood. Scott takes his time in getting here, handling the gore eloquently. While Spielberg kept "Jaws" hidden from view for logistical reasons -- the mechanical shark simply didn't work -- Scott famously fought studio execs to keep his alien hidden from view.
In "Prometheus," his approach is more like Cameron's in "Aliens," favoring special effects action over the unseen corners of darkness of "Alien." This is most successful in an awesomely grotesque "surgical chamber" scene that had me squirming in my seat, mixing claustrophobia with tokophobia (fear of childbirth) - - the exact fears that made the original "Alien" so effective.
These effects-heavy choices could keep Scott from winning his Oscar yet again, but he is long overdue. His films (i.e. "Gladiator") have swept the Oscars, but he himself has never won, having been nominated for best director three times and losing to Jonathan Demme for "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991), Steven Soderbergh for "Traffic" (2000) and Ron Howard for "A Beautiful Mind" (2001).
In "Prometheus," we can see the knack for storytelling that makes him one of the elites working today. He happily eats up screen time, building tension before any blood is shed, but keeping us gripped the entire way. I had that same sense of dread in my stomach that I had watching "Deliverance" (1972), as the director draws out the dread before whacking you with horror.
The dread comes with a fear of the unknown, rallied by Scott's showmanship. Like DeMille or Spielberg, he has a sort of P.T. Barnum quality, building buzz like Alfred Hitchcock, who forbid moviegoers from entering the theater after the start of "Psycho" (1960) and held faux casting sessions for the role of Mrs. Bates. Scott has used online buzz and talk show appearances to create intrigue over the film's secrets, including Theron joking with Stephen Colbert that studio snipers would probably shoot her if she spilled any secrets.
After all, this is a franchise built on surprises. When shooting the famous "chest bursting" scene in the original "Alien," Scott did not tell his actors it was about to happen. Suddenly, John Hurt began convulsing and blood shoot into the air. Those are real screams on the faces of the actors, and thus BRAVO voted it the #2 Scariest Movie Moment of All Time:
"Prometheus" certainly has its own surprises, like a throwback "Easter egg" just before the end credits, but other unveilings could have used more attention. I wish the script had explored Theron's character more, and I didn't understand the casting of Guy Pearce as the elderly founder of the expedition. Why not just cast an old man? Instead, it looks like a young guy caked in makeup.
Overall, I felt like the build up was much stronger than the payoff, with an ending that doesn't quite satisfy the reason for mankind's existence. Perhaps to leave room for another sequel? Even so, it's one hell of a ride, and you have to admire Scott's ambition as he tries to match Kubrick's "2001: A Spacey Odyssey" (1968) and Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life" (2011).
The epic tale had me gripped from start to finish, with enough allusions to satisfy fans of the original (i.e. Jerry Goldsmith's eerie score), and enough of a standalone journey to thrill the newbies. Scott's first sci-fi effort since "Blade Runner" is a replicant worth seeing. That is, if you can stomach it.)

WASHINGTON - Homeowners may not have cause for concern in some areas, but north and west of D.C. heavy, wet snow could throw out the backs of snow shovelers.
It's not unusual for such snow to produce patients for physical therapists like Ira Silverstein, who operates a practice within 10 blocks of the White House.
"We call them seasonal injuries and we see them," Silverstein says.
"Usually the most common injuries are back injuries or shoulder injuries," he says.
Snow shovelers tend to hurt themselves when they bend at the waist instead of the knees then twist their bodies, throwing the snow to the side.
"I recommend keeping your feet flat and that's usually going to force you to bend your knees as you're going to bend forward to lift the snow," Silverstein says.
It's also wise to face the direction where you'll throw the snow, he says.
"[Throw it] straight out in front of you," Silverstein says.
"So you eliminate the rotary component liable to create the injury," he says.
Silverstein also urges shovelers to do just a little at a time.
"Moderation is the key, and just remember to throw the snow right in front of you and bend your knees," he says.
Feeling stiff and achy after shoveling heavy, wet snow is one thing, but Silverstein warns that having troubling straightening your back a couple of hours after the job is a tell tale sign of.

Happy Birthday, Phil Collins…… But What’s That on His Head?
It never fails that every day, a random thought will come to mind. Usually, if I’m near a computer, phone, notebook, etc., I’ll go online to research whatever it is; and of course, I’m somewhat partial to using Google.
Well, this morning, when I logged on to, I was met with what turned out to be a pleasant surprise. At first, I was a bit confused as all I saw was the profile view of a man. I looked at my address window to make sure I was on the right page and then realized that this must be a special day in some aspect and that Google must’ve been honoring something.
So, I put my mouse over the man to see what would happen. Go ahead and check it out for yourself. Then, tell me what you think is on his head.

Meet Gary Grant
By Amber Nimocks and Frank Stasio
Gary Grant's family has owned land in eastern North Carolina since just after the Civil War when his great-grandfather, a former slave, bought a farm. That is one reason Grant has made his life's work defending the rights of African-American land owners in rural North Carolina. Grant is the executive director of the Concerned Citizens of Tillery and founding president of the National Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Association. Both groups have fought the federal Department of Agriculture to undo the wrongs of racial discrimination that have cost black farmers their land.

Lewis-Gale NICU plans generate opposition
Carilion and a state panel say a new neonatal intensive care unit is not needed.
Related
MedBeat blog
An effort by Lewis-Gale Medical Center to add a neonatal intensive care unit faces two hurdles, including opposition from Carilion Clinic and a state government report recommending against allowing the new service.
The Salem hospital, which is owned by the national for-profit company HCA Inc., is seeking approval from the Virginia health commissioner to add an NICU with eight specialty bassinets to treat babies born with complications, such as those who are premature or have low birth weight.
The government report, which was completed by staff working for the Virginia Department of Health, says the $3.4 million Lewis-Gale project does not appear to be economically viable and would be a duplication of services already available at Carilion. Lewis-Gale had projected that the NICU would lose $91,290 in the first year and $60,678 in the second year.
But the staff report suggests that the loss is "significantly understated."
Lewis-Gale spokeswoman Nancy May said the project is not intended to be a profitmaker for the hospital system.
"Over the long term, it may break even, or there might be a modest profit," she said.
Instead Lewis-Gale officials have been consistent in saying they are interested in establishing an NICU to help keep mothers and babies together in the same hospital.
"We want to provide the very best service for our moms and babies," May said. "The bottom line when you have a baby who needs NICU services, it is in the best interest of the mom, the baby, and the family to be able to keep that mom and baby together."
Carilion did not oppose the project during a public hearing in September, but the health system's head of pediatrics, Dr. Alice Ackerman, wrote a letter Oct. 1 detailing her concerns with Lewis-Gale's proposed NICU.
"The addition of NICU beds proposed in Lewis-Gale's application will increase the number of beds in an already oversupplied market during a time when both the region and nation are experiencing a decrease in birth and prematurity rates, diminishing the overall need for NICU care," Ackerman wrote.
Specifically, the 60-bed NICU at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital operates at 71 percent capacity and has not exceeded 80 percent this year. The state recommends that NICUs operate at a capacity threshold of 85 percent.
Ackerman said that any new services at Lewis-Gale would diminish the NICU numbers at Carilion.
The health department staff report also suggests that Lewis-Gale's projections for the number of patients it would serve is "overly ambitious" and furthermore says any new admissions would "only come at the expense of existing providers."
May said she couldn't comment on the capacity level at Carilion or the state's recommended threshold.
While the government report recommends denying Lewis-Gale's application for an NICU, it offers an alternative suggestion that Lewis-Gale seek to establish an intermediate level nursery for babies who need extra care but do not need the specialized care of an NICU.
Lewis-Gale's application for an NICU comes as the hospital made several changes as it vies for a larger slice of the maternity market in the region. In April, Lewis-Gale announced a $2.5 million renovation to its maternity wing shortly after adding three doctors who specialize in obstetrics and gynecology to the hospital staff.
The next step for Lewis-Gale's application will come when the Virginia Department of Health holds a fact-finding conference in early November in Richmond to discuss the application. State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Remley then will make the final determination.

Aurélie Filippetti and Valentino
Photo By Thibaut Chapotot/MCC
FRENCH ACCOLADES: The French love Valentino, a fact certified on Wednesday evening when the designer received the Commandeur de l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal, given by Aurélie Filippetti, France’s minister of culture and communications.
“You have never left the front stage, as you were recently honored by the New York City Ballet for the costumes you created…,” said Filippetti, perched on black Valentino stilettos.
Given by France’s culture ministry, the distinction recognizes significant contributions to the arts, literature or the propagation of these fields.
It is the third time the designer, who owns Château de Wideville on the outskirts of Paris, is being honored in the French capital. In 2006, he was presented with the Légion d’Honneur. “The ceremony was in the same reception room [a gilded reception room overlooking the Palais-Royal],” Valentino told WWD, his new medal pinned on his gray flannel suit.
In 2008, the mayor of Paris awarded him with the Grand Médaille de Vermeil de la Ville de Paris, the equivalent of making him an honorary citizen of the French capital.
Close friends of the couturier — Giancarlo Giammetti, Georgina Brandolini, Doris Brynner and French actress Nathalie Baye — were among guests at the reception, where singer Benjamin Biolay and Serge Toubiana, general director of the Cinématèque Française, were also being honored.

BROOKLYN BASHES: “Chuck, no cutting in line,” said a partygoer, to Ed Westwick of “Gossip Girl” as he tried to bypass the crowd and head into a Glamour magazine party on Wednesday night. Inside the courtyard at Williamsburg’s Wythe Hotel, girls in colorful rompers and cutoff jean shorts were drinking rose, eating greasy french fries and snapping pictures that were promptly displayed on a giant brick wall. The images will soon appear in a new print and digital campaign for Glamour.
Perhaps the photos will also land on Tumblr? The microblogging platform held its own party a few blocks away, at Hotel Williamsburg on North 12th Street. The event also had a photo booth, but revelers were more interested in the Luke’s Lobster food truck and the plentiful bottles of Stella Artois. A genuine pool party, many guests ended up swimming, water wings and all. Tumblr’s founder David Karp, meanwhile, was found outside at the Mexicue truck.

Amazon mammals
Up in the trees and under the water
What mammals will you find in the region?
Jaguar (Panthera onca)2Revered and feared, the jaguar is the biggest cat of the American continent. Despite a wide distribution in rainforests, flooded swamp areas, grasslands, thorn scrub woodlands and dry deciduous forests, it is scattered in these places and generally decreasing in numbers outside of the Amazon rainforest, its main stronghold.
The jaguar's shape and agility makes it particularly well adapted to swimming, climbing and crawling, not to mention sprinting at incredible speeds.
Its strength allows it to capture a variety of species. Large-sized ungulates such as deer are preferred, but peccaries and caimans also can be part of the menu. Its jaws and teeth are so powerful, that it can literally bite through the shell of a turtle.
When the Mayan and Inca civilizations ruled, the jaguar was revered as a divine creature. Aztecs even fed the hearts of sacrificed victims to them. In the Amazon, it was believed that the jaguar’s eyes have a connection to the spirit world.3
Today, things have changed. Persecution, degradation of the jaguar's habitat, and decrease in its prey are thought to have reduced the species population to less than 50,000 mature breeding individuals in the wild.
While commercial hunting and trapping of jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970's through public information campaigns and trade controls, the species is still a victim of ranchers, who kill it because it preys on cattle.
The jaguar is classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
Tapir (Tapirus terrestris)4Another great swimming mammal, the tapir is found in lowland tropical and subtropical moist forests, with a preference for moist, wet or seasonally inundated areas. The combined impacts of deforestation, hunting and competition from domestic livestock have led to a reduction of its population.
In addition to its swimming abilities, the tapir can reach fairly quick speeds on land. Like many tropical mammals, tapirs are mostly active at night. Adults can reach about 2 m and over 227 kg. Tapirs eat leaves, fruit, grass and aquatic plants.
Deforestation is an ongoing threat in several places where the species is found. Hunting may also reduce the population even further.
The tapir is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
Giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis)The world's largest otter is found throughout the Amazon River Basin, where the combined impacts of habitat loss and pollution pose risks to the long-term survival of the species.
The giant otter is almost 1.5 m long, with an additional metre provided by its tail. Its webbed feet, semi-flattened tail and reddish-brown, water-repellent fur make it particularly well-suited to swimming. It is found in groups of 3 to 9 individuals, foraging in tributaries (especially around oxbow lakes), and in slow-moving rivers, lakes and swamps. The giant otter feeds on fish, mammals, birds and other vertebrates.
While otter fur trade has decreased, illegal hunting is still an ongoing problem. In addition, habitat loss and pollution from mining activities are a concern. Otters may also be victims of fishing nets in rivers.
Giant otters are classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species5, and are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

A Passion To Bear Witness: Why War Correspondents Take The Risk
Originally published on Wed May 23, 2012 10:01 am
Journalists don't talk about the danger. They don't usually recount the moments of agonizing terror that come after a bad decision to continue on down the road as the faint sound of mortar shells grows louder.
For war correspondents, it is a choice, after all. No one asked the civilians caught up in the bloody mayhem if they want to be there. There is no sign-up sheet when war breaks out, or a state's army is ordered to shell civilian neighborhoods, or snipers take deadly aim. Reporting in harm's way is part of the job; to bear witness to the suffering is part of the calling; to force to the surface the meaning in the violence is the goal. You have to get close for that kind of reporting.
The death of a young, gifted reporter, Anthony Shadid, has raised the question: Why take the risk? Every reporter who has ever packed a flak jacket and helmet along with a pair of running shoes knows the answer. Shadid took his share of risk, but no more than many of his colleagues. Those who work in dangerous places are devastated by the loss but understand his passion to bear witness. They have all done the same.
He was often asked to account for what "outsiders" saw as a certain recklessness. He'd already had some hair-raising close calls including a gunshot wound and a kidnapping along with his New York Times colleagues in Libya. An interviewer for Mother Jones magazine put the question directly. How did Shadid determine which stories were worth risking his life? Is there a story worth dying for?
"I've struggled with that question a lot," he said. "I don't think there's any story worth dying for, but I do think there are stories worth taking risks for."
For Shadid, the Syrian revolt was one of those stories. Most correspondents covering the conflict do so from Lebanon. For almost 10 months the Syrian government has kept tight rein on visas, and even those allowed to enter are heavily monitored. But in recent weeks, as the government's grip on the country has loosened, many reporters have crossed illegally into Syria to bear witness to one of the bloodiest chapters in Arab uprisings.
CNN's Arwa Damon made it all the way into Homs, a city under brutal siege for months. While citizen journalists have taken a lead role in supplying real-time videos of the shelling of civilian neighborhoods, Damon's presence gives an international platform and a voice to the suffering. It is no longer possible to look away. She is taking an incredible risk and I thought of her when I heard the news of Shadid's death. I wondered how she would answer this question: Is a story worth dying for? I am sure it is a question she hasn't considered. Anthony Shadid's death reminds reporters in the field that the worst can happen. I doubt it will stop any of them.

Technote (troubleshooting)
Problem(Abstract)
ACN5935W The mailbox restore operation has only partially completed is reported during a individual mailbox restore attempt
Symptom
Restore will appear to function and when data is being moved into the mailbox the ACN5935W is reported
Cause
A large number of mailbox items has resulted in a MAPI overflow. Due to this, only a partial number of messages were copied to the mailbox.
Diagnosing the problem
The restore will show the following behavior:
VSS Restore operation completed with rc = 0
Files Examined : <Number of files>
Files Completed : <Number of files>
Files Failed : 0
Total Bytes : <Bytes>
Total LanFree Bytes : 0
Recovery being run. Please wait. This may take a while...
Querying Exchange Recovery Database...
Checking Active Directory entries...
Recovering deleted items for mailbox '<mailbox name>'. This
process may take several minutes...
Restoring mailbox '<Mailbox name>' to original location...
Mailbox restore failed.
ACN5935W The mailbox restore operation has only partially completed.
Removing Exchange Recovery Database...
Total mailboxes requested for restore: 1
Total mailboxes restored: 0
ACN0151E Errors occurred while processing the request.
A trace of the restore attempt can show:
mapihandler.cpp (2537): Exit MAPIHandler::logoff(), hr = 0x00000000
mapihandler.cpp (1339): Exit MAPIHandler::restoreMessages(), hr = MAPI_W_PARTIAL_COMPLETION
MAPIBackEnd.cpp (1800): restoreMessages failed
MAPIBackEnd.cpp (1856): Exit restoreMailbox, rc = 2110
MAPIBackEnd.cpp (1558): Exit handleMessage, rc = 2110
Resolving the problem
There are two possible solutions to the behavior. The first is to use the mailbox filters with the restore. The filters can limit the number of messages which are processed at one time for the restoration, but will require the full restore of the mailbox to be done in stages. For example:
tdpexcc.exe restoremailbox "mailbox name" /MAILBOXFILTER=STARTDATETIME,07/01/2012
/MAILBOXFILTER=ENDDATETIME,08/01/2012
The second solution is to restore the entire database to a Recovery Database. Once the database has been restored, then use the Exchange Restore-Mailbox cmdlet to recover the database. This cmdlet will use the Exchange Management Shell to extract the entire mailbox and does not utilize the MAPI interface. Refer to the Data Protection documentation for information on a full database recovery.

WordPress SEO Guide: Things to be Careful With
WordPress is the most popular website management platform out there (something you’re surely aware of), and also quite an SEO-optimized platform right from the get-go.
There are, however, some issues and things to be careful with when working with your WordPress site’s SEO. This post describes a handful of them and how not to fall into trouble.
Extensive sidebar and menu links
The problem is not when you link to many subpages of your blog. It’s when you link multiple times to the same sub page.
For instance, you might have a certain page that has links pointing to it in the top menu, the sidebar, and then the footer, and who knows where else.
This isn’t good for SEO. The problem is that every page has a certain amount of SEO juice to share. Linking to a given page just once is enough, you don’t have to do it multiple times.
Linking a key-phrase every time you can
Here’s the problem. If you have a sub page about “learning guitar chords,” for example, then there’s a big chance that every time you use “learning guitar chords” on your site you will link it to that sub page.
Having site-wide anchor texts is not a good practice, and many SEOs advise against it. Sending your visitors over to another page every time you use a given phrase is just too aggressive and too pitchy.
Instead, link to the content of your site only when it makes sense – when the visitor can benefit from additional info in that specific moment. Don’t link just for the sake of it.
Duplicate content
Hold on. Right now you’re probably thinking that this problems doesn’t concern you, right?
It does. It concerns every WordPress blog.
Let’s use our “learning guitar chords” example again. If you create a new post on the topic, put it in a category of “guitar chords” and also add a tag “guitar chords” then you end up with at least three pages of duplicate content.
From now on your post can be seen at:
- domain.com/your-post
- domain.com/categories/guitar-chords
- domain.com/tag/guitar-chords
To protect against this you need to tell Google not to index some of these pages. The best way of doing this is to use some of the popular SEO plugins, like All in One SEO Pack or WordPress SEO by Yoast.
SEO titles and descriptions that are too long
By default, WordPress lets you set titles of your posts and pages, and then uses them as the SEO titles as well. The descriptions, however, are created from the first couple of sentences of your post’s/page’s content.
This isn’t optimal for SEO. First of all, post titles are rarely SEO-optimized. When you are in the middle of crafting a title for your post you want to speak to your audience first, and then think about other things like SEO. Secondly, these titles are usually longer than what Google says is okay.
When it comes to descriptions the situation is even worse because it always ends with three dots (“…”) indicating that the description is not complete, and there’s really little chance that any relevant keywords are present there.
Thankfully, you can use most SEO plugins to do this job for you too (the two aforementioned ones).
The best practice for this is to set your titles and descriptions by hand. Keep your titles below 70 characters, and your descriptions below 155 characters. Include relevant keywords and make the message interesting and inviting.
Using too many “nofollow” links
Many SEOs agree that nofollow links shouldn’t be used too extensively within a single website. The main idea behind nofollow links is that you use them to guide the link juice of your site in a certain direction … to improve some sites and disregard others. This makes sense, but only in a small range of cases.
Try not to link to the same page one time with a nofollow link and then with a do-follow link (normal link). If you’ve decided to link to one page with a nofollow link then simply don’t change your mind.
Nofollow links make sense when dealing with some “meta content” pages like, for example: privacy policy, terms of use, disclaimers, disclosures, and others similar.
This closes the list. What other SEO practices do you know of that can work against you if not done properly? Feel free to share.

Video: “Road to Brooklyn,” An Inspiring Recap on the Team that Revived the Borough
This article was posted by ColaP 3 months, 2 weeks, 2 days, 23 hours, 41 minutes ago.
Now that the Barclays Center is up and running, and the Brooklyn Nets are midway through their season, it’s time to take a look back on the remarkable impact this development has had on the Brooklyn community.
In this video, “Road to Brooklyn: A Final Look Back,” you’ll hear commentary from an array of people: franchise managers, Nets dancers and players, Brooklyn residents, and Barclays center construction workers. All of them share in the excitement and pride that surrounds what has become an iconic moment for Brooklyn – the development and creation of an identity, a logo, and a team that is theirs.
Members of the community comment on how the Brooklyn Nets logo is “everywhere right now,” and how this may be the “biggest, most powerful, global, iconic change in sports.” Another person notes that “the Brooklyn Nets probably have more pressure on them than any team in the NBA because of the city they’re in.”
Check out this latest Life+Times video, an inspiring follow-up on Hova’s earlier Brooklyn-based documentary, “Where I’m From,” which focused on the construction and creation of the Barclays Center.

South Bend, IN (Sports Network) - A Top-25 showdown is on tap in the Big East Conference on Saturday, as the 11th-ranked Louisville Cardinals take on the 25th-ranked Notre Dame Fighting Irish at Purcell Pavilion.
Rick Pitino's Cardinals are in the thick of the conference race. Louisville has won three straight games, putting some distance between itself and an ugly three-game slide. The Cardinals began a two-game road trip on Wednesday with a 68-48 rout of Rutgers to move to 19-4 overall and 7-3 in league play, a half game behind both Syracuse and Marquette.
Mike Brey's Irish aren't far off the mark with a 6-4 league ledger. Notre Dame dropped a 63-47 decision at league-leading Syracuse on Monday, ending a three- game win streak. The Fighting Irish are 13-2 at home this season.
Louisville holds an 18-11 series advantage. These two teams split a pair of meetings a year ago, with the Cardinals getting revenge for a regular-season loss to the Irish with a 64-50 victory in the semifinals of the Big East Tournament.
Louisville held the Scarlet Knights to a mere 32-percent shooting effort in a 20-point win in Piscataway. Sophomore Wayne Blackshear led the way for the Cardinals off the bench with 19 points in just 14 minutes of work. Junior Russ Smith added 14 points to the cause, while senior point guard Peyton Siva finished with nine points and seven assists.
The Cardinals have been solid at both ends of the floor this season and as a result, enjoy a +16.4 scoring margin. The team is shooting a solid .450 from the field and averaging 73.6 ppg. The defensive effort has been far more consistent, holding opponents to a mere 57.2 ppg and under 40 percent shooting (.396). Smith is a dynamic scorer, averaging 18.2 ppg to rank fourth in the Big East. Siva can score as well (10.6 ppg) but may be more valuable as a distributor (fourth in the conference at 6.1 apg). Chane Behanan (10.4 ppg, 7.2 rpg) and Gorgui Dieng (8.9 ppg, 9.8 rpg) give the team balance in the frontcourt.
Trailing by six points at the half, Notre Dame never allowed itself to get back into the game against Syracuse, going ice-cold in the second half, converting just 27.9 percent from the floor over the final 20 minutes, including a mere 2-of-11 from behind the arc. Jerian Grant led the way in defeat with 15 points. Jack Cooley posted another double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds.
The Irish have been much more efficient at the offensive end this season, ranking ninth nationally in field-goal percentage (.487), while leading the nation in assists/turnover ratio (1.74). Cooley has been the driving force with his dominance in the paint. The 6-foot-9 senior is converting 58.4 percent of his shots and is averaging a double-double with 14.2 points and 11.2 rebounds per outing. His rebounding efforts rank fifth nationally. Grant and Eric Atkins provide perimeter scoring with 13.4 and 12.8 ppg, respectively. Both are top-tier distributors, with Grant doling out 5.9 apg and Atkins coming in at 4.8 apg.

360 Panorama may not produce the most professional looking panoramic photos, but it is far and away the most fun panoramic photo app out there.
iPhone Integration Rating:
User Interface Rating:
Re-use / Replay Value Rating:
Overall Rating: stitching photos to make a nice picture, this app seems to use video to put them together. All you have to do is aim the camera at a space and then move the camera around the original image. The app, all on its own, takes the resulting image and makes is a panoramic shot. Best of all, if you want to get really wacky you can make your 360 degree image a stereographic panorama, making the picture seem to loop around in a circle.
The only downside of the app is that the resulting images don’t come together as professionally as other panorama apps. They tend to have wobbly and lumpy borders, even with the most still of hands. I set my iPhone on a desk and slowly spun it around and I still got the jitters in my picture.
Still, though, even with the not so perfect images, the app was a joy to use. I found myself making picture after picture (with my pictures heavily weighted towards the stereographic variety), not caring if the resulting pictures were perfect or not.
Maybe 360 Panorama isn’t the most perfect panoramic photo app, but it’s by far the most fun to use. I have a feeling that by the end of 2010, most of the other apps of this kind will have been deleted from my camera and forgotten about, but 360 Panorama may just find a permanent spot in my little photo folder.
A number of former (and current) Xbox Indie developers share their experiences and reasoning behind moving or expanding to iOS.

Bringing on Big Island's best- from tropical property to hosting real estate, agent Molly Harris of Live Here, Buy That - HGTV hits romantic market target.
Kamuela, Hawaii (PRWEB) January 19, 2013
Another 2013 Hawaii real estate star ascends with agent Molly Harris of MacArthur & Company/Sotheby’s International Realty going before cameras January 19 shooting HGTV viewers on an 8 episode fantasy island tour of hot-listed properties matching the wish lists of "Live Here, Buy This" guests.
After a 2010 stint on HGTV’s House Hunters International while living in Costa Rica, Harris was asked to showcase the best of the Big Island’s tropical properties for HGTV’s latest hit. “I’m excited to show what the Big Island of Hawaii has to offer. Above romantic beachfront properties, the real value of the alluring investments we represent has kept our clients happy and our company locally and internationally competitive for decades.”
Harris returned home to Hawaii a year ago with a huge appreciation for the Big Island and the people who live there. “After running my own luxury real estate business in Costa Rica for years with the competition (Christie’s), the only company I could possibly have joined next was MacArthur & Company/Sotheby’s International Realty. While "Live Here, Buy This" will be great for all the real estate agencies in Hawaii, I’m glad to have the support of our global realty team, as well as working with strong, smart women like Dodie (MacArthur, CEO.) I’m also a HGTV junkie with a four-year old, so I can totally relate to the viewers needing to indulge fantasy options.” After screening hundreds of properties, Harris can’t wait to show how far dollars will stretch here on the Big Island over Hawaiian properties elsewhere.
When choosing the hosting real estate agent and agency for this initial run of their new season’s eight episodes, "Live Here, Buy This," Rebecca Tyo of JV Productions, shared she sought out MacArthur and Company/Sotheby’s International Realty because the brand is famed for beautiful listings and top professional agents - components trusted to show and sell properties which Hawaii home seekers and viewers alike crave.
Rebecca_Keliihoomalu , Senior VP, R(B), recently showcased a single room of Shangri-La for HGTV's show, "Million Dollar Rooms," highlighting again the company's commitment in partnering for success. Three out of the top ten top producers on Hawaii (H.I.S, 2012) are agents of MacArthur and Company/Sotheby's International Realty - a testament to the company's steadfast striving for dreams to come true for both clients and associates.
"Live Here, Buy This" ranks often among HGTV's number one shows in the 18-49 year old bracket -- a great match for the brand reputation of Sotheby's International Realty's wider reach. With Molly’s ease sharing real estate in front of global cameras, lining up with a great fantasy-fulfilling concept, a longstanding brokerage with an abundance of listings of all types, plus guests primed to explore options “... we’re eager to show anyone can afford to live in paradise!” enthused Tyo.
Harris said she’s as comfortable in her thigh-high snake boots shopping raw land and real estate in the jungle as she is slipping into heels for their firm’s most upscale clients and HGTV viewers so stay tuned to see where the show steps out with Molly for Hawaiian dreams fulfilled on "Live Here, Buy This."

Hello friends, I hope you had a great weekend. Things went well over here. Saturday was my birthday and I celebrated it with my family. My gal and I spent most of the weekend beating Epic Mickey 2. I'll be working on a review soon. I hope you've gotten a chance to play through some of it. What are your impressions so far? I did want to highlight game publisher Taito this week. We'll start with the people that put the music to the games.
The internal music team Zuntata celebrates 25 years. I had previously talked about the studio and a free album they published in Arcadia. Many game companies have come and gone in the past 25 years, it is rare to find a group that has not only survived the generations but has also maintained quality in their productions. To celebrate Taito is publishing the Cozmo album which is a collection of the best from Zuntata.
Arcade classics, console and handheld releases all appear on the album. From Battle Gear to Darius Burst, all of the catchy melodies are on the album. Check the track listing on the website and if there is a Japanese bookstore near you be sure to order a copy for yourself!

Aliens RPG Is Officially Dead
Sega and Obsidian confirm that the project is no more.
Work on Aliens: Colonial Marines continues in earnest over at Gearbox. Obsidian's Aliens RPG, however, is not so lucky. According to Giant Bomb, Obsidian has confirmed that development on the game has officially ceased.
"Rumors have circled around a bit regarding the fate of the Aliens role playing game that Obsidian and SEGA had been working on," an Obsidian representative said on the developer's official forums.
."
Asked for independent confirmation, Sega responded with a short statement, saying, "Sega has no plans to move forward with the Aliens RPG." They then went on to say they were very "excited and focused" on Aliens vs. Predator.
Rumors initially hit back in February that the Aliens RPG had been canceled, only a day after Aliens vs. Predator had been officially announced. While Aliens: Colonial Marines was confirmed to still be in development, the Aliens RPG is 100 percent dead.
Obsidian is now focusing on Fallout: New Vegas and Alpha Protocol, the latter of which is due out this fall.

i agree that Let them take the time and focus on whatPosted: Jun 28, 2009 12:00AM PST by cnshiying
Let them take the time and focus on what they're doing instead of trying to spread themselves too thin because then (theoretically) it should make for a more polished game instead of a half-assed attempt that would only serve to taint the franchise and lingerie wholesale cause people to bitch and moan about how shitty it turned out.
Whatever...Posted: Jun 27, 2009 12:00AM PST by king_mob
It's hard to imagine an Aliens RPG really being a compelling game. There's not a whole lot of interction you can have with those creatures. They either kill you on sight or take you back to the hive and stuff you with one of their young. Not many options there. Colonial Marines sounds like the Aliens game fans of the movie are really waiting for. I'll definitely check it out, at least as a rental...
that sucks....Posted: Jun 27, 2009 12:00AM PST by Damiannnn4
I have to say that I really enjoyed the Aliens movies. An Aliens RPG by Obsidian would have been awesome. I loved KOTOR so it really sucks to see that they won't be making an Alien RPG it could have been a very great game. lol at the Danny Glover comment. Alien is much better than Predator.

They announced this about a month ago in OXM in the article about Aliens vs. Predator. An Alien RPG sounds pretty lame anyway. Clumsy battles + H.R. Giger's Alien = worthless. And if Mass Effect can't pull of non clumsy RPG gun battles then Alien RPG def. wouldn't have. Sorry but if Bioware can't do it then almost no one can.

So we were surprised to hear Ubisoft's Ben Mattes note his preference for Prince of Persia on Wii about a month ago, when he said in a 1UP interview, "I've spent a lot of time playing [Prince of Persia] games over the last few years, and Rival Swords for the Wii is by far my favorite."
Now that we've had a chance to spend a few hours with the game, we've found controls that are in some ways better and some ways worse than what we're accustomed to from the series -- and in some ways exactly the same. The movement controls, for instance -- for things like running around, climbing, jumping, and wall running -- use the Wii's analog stick and A, B, C and Z buttons, and all that works just like it does in other versions of the game.
The "better" comes with triggering context specific maneuvers. When you sneak up behind someone to perform a stealth kill, it feels fantastic to flick your wrist and perform each of the individual hits that make up that kill. Similarly, when you have to do things like stick your knife into a point on the wall to hold yourself there, it's simply more fun to flick the Wii Remote than it is to push a button..
Combat is where things start to falter. Like Zelda, you flick your wrist in any direction with the Remote to attack, and repeated flicks (along with combination movements with the Nunchuck) allow you to perform combos, throws, and all your fancy attacks. As it has been throughout the series, combat in the game is a bit clumsy, so when you combine the lack of precision in the combat engine with the downgrade in precision you get by moving the Wii Remote to trigger your attack animations, it all feels a bit loose. That noted, in our time with the game, not once did we die as a result of poor combat execution, so it doesn't seem like the change is a major flaw -- at least early in the game -- but it definitely presents a significant change.
The rest of the game, of course, does not, as this is a feature-for-feature port of Two Thrones with the same graphics and same everything, simply retiled Rival Swords for Wii. And that more than anything else is the trickiest selling point for the game. Since you can now pick up the GameCube version of Two Thrones cheap and play it on Wii, Rival Swords is a very tough sell at full price.
Whether this version is better than the GameCube game -- apart from the price -- is a difficult call at this point. It's close, which we had our doubts about before playing it, and at least we can say with certainty that the game is still worth playing. This isn't the kind of game you bought your Wii for, but if you missed out on Two Thrones back in 2005 and want to try it now in a way that feels new, Rival Swords seems like a decent option. It's just a question of if what was worth $50 in 2005 is still worth that now.

An Interesting ExperimentPosted: Mar 06, 2007 12:00AM PST by Nintendoll
I think it's an interesting idea to port from an older to a next-gen, however if that's the case I dont' think it should have the same selling price as say, Legend of Zelda, Rayman, Red Steel, etc.I personally haven't played the 'Cube version so I'll probably be getting it. Used, and with my employee discount.
PricePosted: Mar 05, 2007 12:00AM PST by m3ds
I was actually thinking of buying this game. I had never had a chance to play it on the cube, and this looked like a good way to do it, but as this interview pointed out the price is scaring me off. I might just go pick it up cheap for gamecube.

played the original so I don't really care if it is a remake. But I think they just did this to see if the controls could work on wii and if they can they will probably have the next POP simultaneously released with the other versions or a built from the ground up version just for the wii.

IT'S NOT WORTH IT! Wii owners unite! Don't buy recycled crap. Anything that is also coming to PS2/PSP = garbage. Wii want games like No More Heroes, and um, Dragon Quest Swords? Wii'll get some good games eventually. Lest we forget, Smash Bros! So who cares!
sounds cool but bewarePosted: Mar 01, 2007 12:00AM PST by extremegamer22
Prince of Persia is an amazing game and the wii controlls will probaly make it better more difficult and interesting but Farcry vengence looked like an amazing game but made the player want to kill him self because of the peice of crap port it made and the game felt dumbed down hopefuly ubisoft does not do the same for prnce of persia just because it looks kiddy dont dumb down the games

As much as I'd like to hat a port like this, I'll have to admit that it does show how games can be adapted for the Wii...maybe some better 3rd party support will follow. i'm def. getting this game.
Who wants to bet....Posted: Mar 01, 2007 12:00AM PST by smuj
That when 1up reviews this game they will say the camera control is broken while they say that part of the game is great in this preview. Also who wants to bet whoever reviews the game will probably suck at it. I don't care about PoP and won't buy it but am just ranting about 1up pointless fluff previews, if it's gonna suck say it now not 2 days after the game comes out. Say it to your audience and the developers so maybe some games won't suck. 1up just like all other game sites and magazines with their shining previews then reviews that say the exact opposite are one of the biggest problems with the game industry. They get gamers all hyped up about a game saying it's so great then when they review a game after you bought it on their hype they do a 180. FUCKING UNETHICAL!
as for rival swordsPosted: Mar 01, 2007 12:00AM PST by coldplaysux19
i think it's kinda sneaky that UBI gave a new title to an old game. some customers who aren't in the know might be fooled by this. This game should be sold at a discount price of $30. I think that would be a lot more fair.
NogarPosted: Mar 01, 2007 12:00AM PST by coldplaysux19
I think you've got it backwards. Sony promised that the "next gen" WOULD NOT begin until the ps3 arrived on the scene. It promised better graphics than the 360 and a FULLY backwards compatible console. Nintendo, on the other hand, delivered exactly what they promised...a new way to play that would appeal to a broader audience...and sure as hell...they delivered...and then some.
If it wasn't a remake of Two Thrones...Posted: Mar 01, 2007 12:00AM PST by jaredgood1
I'd be excited. The abomination that was Warrior Within killed the franchise for me for that system generation. I don't care how good Two Thrones was (and Rival Swords might be), UBI screwed things up with WW and that generation of POP titles is done for me. I'll pop in Sands of Time and wait for a new POP.

Now now now, lets settle this dispute. Your BOTH retarded. Sony fan- get out of your ivory tower and see that the wii simply appeals to more people with its "new way to play". Nintendo Fan- You must accept that not everyone likes the wii. Some people simply find beautiful graphics more appealing than weird controls.

Well, even if both systems sold out, the Wii would have won by the fact that they had more systems! Let's not act like you don't know this. The Wii is not kicking the 360's butt. Also, I keep thinking that you Nintendo people used to say that you are not competing with MS or Sony, so why do you keep talking about them? Nintendo had their time and now they hate Sony ONLY because they were #1. Nintendo needs to give the people what they want, not what THEY want you to have.

360s suck PS3s rock I Have prove find some reviews for fight night round 3 for PS3. In the review i read it said "Visually smokes every other version of the game" i know they made this game for 360 cause its at my local video store.And 360s are just the same crap as the original. They're exactly the same no new stuff. Wiis rock compared to 360s cause they have new stuff and nintendo is supposed to be getting more games.And the game sounds fun. Ive only played demos of old ones but they were fairly fun games.
LOLPosted: Jan 25, 2007 12:00AM PST by Ridl3y
Are you serious? You bring down the wii because of its graphics? I like the 360, but I have seen a ps3, my friend has one. not only were the graphics nowhere near what they hyped it up to be, infact they were terrible. but the games are retarded too. =)

I played the Wii in the store. It was ok, but got boring fast. The bullshit graphics hooked up to an HDTV revealed it's Wiikness. This system sucks. Only a woman, child, new jack or gay person would buy a Wii. Real players buy a 360 or even a PS3(overpriced).
RE: Poutineman (Poutine is nasty)Posted: Jan 24, 2007 12:00AM PST by n0gar
My point for all of those Nintendo paid hype men, was that an offering like this and mostly all Wii games shows that publishers just put whatever out on the Wii because the system is a bullshit system that must have because it can only produce bullshit games. When a publisher does this, they are saying "fuck a Wii." If I were a publisher, I would put out a Wii game just to say that I did it and see what happens. I know that I would be more into systems that can allow me to do more as opposed to doing what was done last time around. Also, 1up, when are you going to put the 360 in the first slot for your platforms at the top of the page? The PS2 reign is last generation. The 360 reign is now. Let's show the world that you are not on the take.

repackaged system? The wiimote is a pretty fundamental difference. If you ask me, sony is repackaging the same old system, but with better graphics (which are inevitable in the gaming industry).

Whats up with that??Posted: Jan 24, 2007 12:00AM PST by marksquires78
I'd rather wait a year or so for an original Prince of Persia for the Wii instead of a port from the last gen consoles. I'm sure the Wii-mote will add some thrills to the experience, but I really didn't want to see Dark Prince again in my PoP experience. That bloody depleting health crap needs to go. But it is an exciting time for the Wii it seems. Third party support is starting to come into effect and I have a feeling that this Nintendo console will have many more games to play than the old Gamecube. Woo hoo!!
anyone who buys this deserves to be shotPosted: Jan 24, 2007 12:00AM PST by Bullet_Math
The GC version is dirt cheap right now and isn't a port of a GC game with less content. Ubisoft need to step their game up or stop developing for the Wii. So far we've seen nothing but crap
Interested, yes, but sad tooPosted: Jan 24, 2007 12:00AM PST by Ultima9999
I never played a 3D PoP. I hear they are all good, and really wanted to play them, but never got a chance. The jury is still out on this for me but if the controls pan out I can see myself picking this up. The sad part is that I love Ubisoft and while I am glad they are showing Wii support, I am a little concerned with the lack of original IPs for it. I mean is Ray Man really the best Ubisoft game to grace this new console? Red Steel was rank with a rushed production, buggy control, unpolished graphics and horrid AI, but at least it was something new and intriuging. PoP series sold a bunch of copies for the last gen consoles, I don't see this being a super hit. But it doesn't mean it wont be good....if they nail the controls. It seems that Ubisoft is still feeling out the Wii, but I don't know how long gamers can take these rehased ports until they abandon ship.
ehh. . .remake for wii?Posted: Jan 24, 2007 12:00AM PST by ghanja_spawnX
im sure the new Wii based controls are intuitive and add a nice new layer of depth to the game. And its nice to see a game like PoP get a little attention and retooling and get a port to a great system like Wii. But considering I've already played it, I'd really rather play a new game. Especially on Wii. I rather pitty the team that worked on this one. Like I said, I'm sure the new controls are great, but they have to realize that the gaming community is an unforgiving lot and will not care how nice the controls are. It's still the same game. Surely a small percentage will get the game on that basis, as well as a new install base that never played it. But bottom line is its a game most of us already played. Most of us will pass this one over, we want Assassins Creed.

Seems like a good way to revisit the Two Thrones.Posted: Jan 23, 2007 12:00AM PST by Keefman -X-
But I would prefer a true follow-up. On a completely unrelated note, I find that interviews with Ubisoft people usually aren't that exciting - they tend to read like the back of a game box. Just a personal observation.
mehPosted: Jan 23, 2007 12:00AM PST by coldplaysux19
it looks kinda cool. I've never really gotten into PoP but this could be a good rental. Bust-a-Move Bash is where it's at though. can't wait
Too much POP and too late to the partyPosted: Jan 23, 2007 12:00AM PST by Hexpane
POP has been a sales flop since it hit the PS2/XBOX Not a bad game its just that no one cares. not sure what it is for everyone else but for me the Puffy pants persian just isnt a character I care about or want to play as. Then again the disney movie aladin was a huge hit, although I hated that as well)

Filing an Auto Insurance Claim
You've just had an auto accident. Perhaps the other driver was clearly to blame, or you were responsible. It may be a minor fender bender or a more serious accident resulting in injuries or extensive damage. Regardless of the severity of the accident or who was at fault, there are a number of basic steps you'll need to follow once the commotion subsides. This can all be a complicated and stressful process. But the more you know, the smoother the process will be and the greater your chances of obtaining a satisfactory outcome.
Report the accident immediately
The first step you should take is to promptly notify your insurance company or agent that you've been in an accident. Do this as soon as possible, even if you're far from home. When you call your insurance company, you'll be asked for specific information regarding the accident. The more information you have collected at the scene, the faster your claim will likely be processed and the better your insurance company can judge how to proceed.
If the accident was minor, you may be tempted to avoid making a report because you don't want your insurance premiums to rise. However, consider the consequences of failing to report the accident. If you don't report it, the other driver may still report the incident separately to the police or to his or her insurance company, and you may be held liable. An unscrupulous driver might even claim that you left the scene of the accident and, since there is no record reflecting your side of the story, he or she might be able to make a case.
Keep in mind that your rates probably won't increase unless you caused the accident. If you live in a no-fault state, expenses related to bodily injury, including lost wages, will be paid exclusively by each party's own insurer, unless the state's threshold for filing lawsuits is equaled or exceeded.
Fill out the appropriate forms
Ask your insurance agent or the company representative about the forms or documents you need to complete in order to support your claim. Your company may require a proof-of-loss form, as well as medical and auto repair bills, a copy of the police report, and other documents relating to your claim. Supply all the materials and information your insurer requests, and do it in a timely manner.
Read your policy
No one really wants to read an auto insurance policy filled with fine print and insurance jargon. But you'll need to be aware of the specifics of your policy in the days following an accident. Knowing what your policy covers can prevent unpleasant surprises. Ideally, though, the best time to look over your policy is before you're feeling stressed in the immediate aftermath of an accident.
Keep records of your expenses and other paperwork
In some cases, your insurance company will pay the hospital, car mechanic, or other service provider directly. In other cases, you are expected to pay these expenses out of your own pocket, and the company will reimburse you for covered expenses. Keep a record of all related expenses. Potential out-of-pocket costs might include medical and hospital bills, car repair bills, rental car charges, and lost wages. Since you will no doubt need receipts in order to be reimbursed, it's wise to keep copies of these and all other documents in a safe location. In fact, you may find it very useful to keep a record or journal of all your dealings relating to the accident.
Understand the role of the insurance adjuster
Your insurance company will assign an adjuster to your case who will be in charge of investigating and making recommendations regarding the settlement of your claim. An appraiser will likely look at and photograph the damage to your car, and you may have to contact a repair shop to get a written estimate (sometimes the adjuster does this). You may receive money right away (after satisfying your deductible) or the claim may be held up, depending on how complicated the situation is. If you feel that the settlement offer is too low, you can appeal it to the insurance company. You'll have to support your case, but you may be able to get a larger settlement.
Don't forget your other insurance
Finally, don't forget that other types of insurance (e.g., health, homeowners) may cover certain losses resulting from an auto accident that are not covered by your auto insurance, depending on the type of loss and other circumstances.

55. Star Power – Mr. Kind Of A Big Deal
There are two types of men in the world: men who try to impress women and men who do not.
Fortunately for me, Mr. Kind Of A Big Deal was the type who tried! And it worked like a charm.
Just like Mr. VIP, he showed up in a suit and invited me to a hot restaurant, Monkey Bar, which is known to attract A-list celebrities. In fact, Ben Stiller was at the table next to us!
He was also about the same age as Mr. VIP, 42, and super successful. But, unlike Mr. VIP, he is divorced. It was too early to tell if his age or marital status will be a good or bad thing.
Right now, it is all good.
We had instant chemistry. Before we even ordered, he said: “Well, if you marry me, you’ll have to live in the West Village.”
“Oh, that would be no problem at all.”
It is only my favorite neighborhood in Manhattan.
I liked his willingness to show affection – from asking me to sit closer to him to complimenting me for being “amazing”.
And I thought it was romantic that he took a cab totally out of his way to spend just five more minutes with me.
I love a funny, romantic man, and when he also has the power, money, status, and good looks of Mr. Kind Of A Big Deal…
Well, he could easily sweep me off my feet!
I can see some of you have already raised an eyebrow to caution me to like him for the “right” reasons. If so, I’d like to say: “Jealousy is a sickness; get well soon”.
Maybe these are my right reasons. What if this is the type of man I am destined to be with? You can hate me now.
I see no problem in being attracted to someone like him, a person with self-discipline and smarts, because he has many of the traits that I already possess!
Okay, his pockets go a little deeper, but I am a work in progress!
It should not be a crime to get excited over someone who can help me co-create the “good life” I live and aspire to have.
I am not going to pretend to be modest. People who know me know I have always been a diva.
Should not a star be with a star?

Preview: Canucks at Blackhawks
An already-fierce rivalry will take on added intrigue when the Chicago Blackhawks host the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night with a chance to make history. Chicago, which is the only team that has yet to lose in regulation, can extend its season-opening points streak to 16 games and tie the NHL record held by the 2006-07 Anaheim Ducks (12-0-4). The Blackhawks are on the verge of matching Anaheim's mark despite playing only five (4-0-1) of their first 15 games at home. One of their three losses came in a shootout at Vancouver on Feb. 1.
The Canucks had won six in a row before dropping their last two games, including a 4-3 shootout loss at home against the St. Louis Blues on Sunday night. Vancouver surrendered only six goals during the six-game winning streak prior to squandering a two-goal lead in a 4-3 loss to Dallas on Saturday. The opportunity to derail Chicago could help get the Canucks back on track. "They are the unbeaten team in regular time, they are the benchmark right now," coach Alain Vigneault said. "We're going to focus on that."
TV: 8:30 p.m. ET, Rogers Sportsnet Pacific (Vancouver), CSN (Chicago)
ABOUT THE CANUCKS (8-3-3): The tandem of Cory Schneider and Roberto Luongo had been brilliant until each goaltender struggled in the last two games. Vigneault has yet to name a starter but Schneider was the first player off the ice following the morning skate - a strong indication he'll play Tuesday. One positive for Vancouver in its loss to St. Louis was scoring a pair of power-play goals in four chances following a 4-for-39 slump. Ryan Kesler had one of them and has a goal and assist in his first two games back from a shoulder injury.
ABOUT THE BLACKHAWKS (12-0-3): Corey Crawford has not skated since Thursday so Ray Emery is expected to make his third straight start in net. Emery will put his perfect record (5-0-0) on the line against a team he has not faced in more than six years. After allowing four goals in his season debut, Emery has permitted seven in his last four games. The game-winning goal in Sunday's win over reigning Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles came courtesy of Patrick Sharp, who snapped a 10-game goalless drought with his third tally.
OVERTIME
1. Chicago is tied with the 1984-85 Edmonton Oilers for the second-longest point streak to open the season. Both Anaheim and Edmonton won the Stanley Cup after their torrid starts.
2. Canucks C Henrik Sedin, who scored his first goal Sunday, has 39 points in 43 games against the Blackhawks.
3. Emery last faced Vancouver on Jan. 18, 2007, as a member of Ottawa. The Senators lost a 2-1 decision to Luongo and the Canucks.
PREDICTION: Canucks 3, Blackhawks 2

…so we were towed by another, similar boat!
We actually spent a good portion of the day out on the water before that happened, though, so I got a nice tour of the countryside from the river…lots of net-fishermen, cattle-herding, and manual farming operations – throwbacks to a simpler time.
This photo was taken on on my first trip to Bangladesh – I was 20 years old at the time. The people around me were friends/penpals, and the fellow sort-of behind me was my primary translator!

Denver Hotels Get Facelifts
The former Cherry Creek Hotel, a "very tired" destination at the corner of Colorado Boulevard and Cherry Creek Drive South, will get a $32 million refurbishing. The eight-story, 210-room building will open by the end of the year as the Hilton Garden Inn and include 11,000 square feet of retail space that includes a Panera Bread and Mediterranean grill, according to the Denver Business Journal. While that project and others are expected to help revitalize Colorado Boulevard, Jesse Morreale, a Denver restaurateur, hotelier, and nightclub owner, is recycling the name of his defunct Cherry Creek fine dining restaurant, Sketch, the name attached to 1,000 square feet of wine, cheese, and chocolate indulgences inside the historic First Avenue Hotel at First Avenue and Broadway, which opened this weekend, writesÂ The Denver Post. The 40-seat, European-style wine bar is the first step in a $5 million renovation to return the 1905 hotel to "its former splendor."

Ryan Call: The New Leader of the State GOP
State Senator Ted Harvey would have embraced Tea Party activists had he been elected chairman of Colorado's Republican Party, but he lost his bid to youthful Ryan Call, the party's legal counsel, over the weekend (Denver Post). Call, who says the GOP should do more to reach out to unaffiliated voters and Latinos, will usher in the post-Dick Wadhams era, as the party is divided over how to win more seats in 2012, a presidential election year. The state GOP kicked off the big weekend with a dinner and keynote by New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, the nation's first Latina head of state (Denver Post).
Harvey and another candidate for the job, Matt Arnold of Clear the Bench Colorado, are surprised Call won so decisively. "There are a lot of very deep, underlying divisions in the party," Arnold said before the vote, "and it's troubling—we're kind of at a point where we're battling for the soul of the Republican Party" (Colorado Statesman). The divisions split those who want to expand the party by encouraging the more conservative, Tea Party base and those who want to bring in more moderate

Tour de Force
Former UVM professor Bill Averyt gives visitors a historical POV
Bill Averyt at Billings Student Center
I have a confession to make. It’s likely that by admitting this, I risk destroying what little street cred I have. But what the heck, here goes: I have always wanted to be a tour guide. That’s right. One of those people who walk backward and hold an umbrella and tell you all sorts of stuff that you never knew you cared about.
I can trace my ambition back to the umpteen college tours I took as a brace-faced high schooler. If I had to guess, I’d say my father and I went on at least two dozen. I loved listening to the student tour guides rattle off obscure facts about each institution: This building is where Spam was invented; this lab is where cold fusion was discovered; this cornerstone is made from rare marble that was a gift from an Indian Maharaja.
Those plucky college kids seemed to know so much trivia, and that trivia made them seem smart. I too wanted to have a cache of factoids in my brain that I could sprinkle into conversation and give the appearance of being learned.
Too bad there weren’t a lot of solid job opportunities in the tour-guiding field, unless I wanted to work at Colonial Williamsburg or drive a tour bus around Washington, D.C. But I’ve found that reporting is nearly the same thing, only without the walking. You absorb a lot of knowledge tidbits, pass them on to people and feel semi-smart until the next story comes along, and you promptly forget everything you learned the week before.
Since moving to Vermont four years ago, the only tour I have taken is the wagon one at Shelburne Farms, three times. So when the opportunity arose to take a historic tour of the University of Vermont, and write about it, I offered myself up.
The UVM historic tour, which has run for slightly more than a year, was the university’s response to a call for more interpretive history offerings from Vermont’s Department of Tourism. It’s distinct from the standard campus tours for prospective students; you’re not going to learn about the food in the dining hall, the atmosphere of the dorms or the university’s “extracurricular offerings.” Like the Queen City Ghostwalk in downtown Burlington and farm tours around the state, it’s seasonal. But, unlike the self-guided walking tours of the heritage districts of Vermont cities such as Montpelier and Barre, UVM’s historical jaunts are led by a tour guide with extensive knowledge of the university.
Despite the reporting I’ve done on UVM, all I knew about the school before the historical tour was that marauding Ira Allen founded it some years back. On a recent drizzly Saturday morning, Professor Emeritus Bill Averyt changed that. Thanks to his expert tour guiding, I now know what a Syrian Arch is and where the term “Richardsonian Romanesque” came from. I know why many of the UVM buildings have multiple dates engraved in their bases and that there is an underground spring on the campus green. I know so much about UVM that I could fool someone into thinking not only that I went to school there, but that I designed the campus myself.
Averyt, a former professor in the School of Business Administration, isn’t cruising around campus to earn work-study cash. The 65-year-old Fulbright Fellow, Woodrow Wilson Fellow and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Grantee says he gets a kick out of being a tour guide. It’s a hobby and a labor of love. He also leads tours at Shelburne Museum and in Key West, where he lives for most of the year.
It took “many, many practices” to get the tour whittled down to a presentation that would make sense to campus visitors, Averyt says. Judging from his performance, he’s got it pretty well massaged. The tour begins at 9 a.m. at the statue of Ira Allen on the campus green. Averyt, his voice equal parts soothing and excited, explains that Allen offered the state legislature 50 acres and 4000 pounds sterling to start a college in this new settlement of Burlington. In 1791, a new institution called Universitas Viridis Montis, or University of the Green Mountains, was born. (The abbreviation UVM comes from the school’s original Latin name — better than UGM, for sure.)
The 10 people taking the hour-and-a-half tour on this particular Saturday range from out-of-state parents dropping off their student children to local history buffs. Averyt, wearing khaki trousers, a plaid collared shirt and a lightweight raincoat, sets the scene by asking participants to imagine what the area looked like when the university was founded 218 years ago. Much of the site was a dense white pine forest. Between the hilltop and the lake lay two villages that had sprung up over the years, with a combined population of about 200 people.
The campus doesn’t offer much to distract us from Averyt’s colorful description. At this “early” hour, few cars drive down University Place, and only a handful of students pass the group.
Averyt asks us to turn our attention to the buildings that make up University Row, formerly known as High Street. Along with the campus green, these structures — Old Mill, Billings Library and the Royall Tyler Theatre most prominent among them — form a designated Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.
The walking tour doesn’t take us beyond the central quad, but Averyt also offers insight on some of the earliest surviving structures in Burlington. Pearl House, Pomeroy Hall, Moses Catlin-John Johnson House and others stand near the green or within pointing distance. Conspicuously absent from Averyt’s dissertation is any substantive mention of the Davis Center, the university’s newest and most controversial building.
Averyt’s retention of even the most obscure details is impressive. Sure, he’s been doing the tours for a year, but this guy knows what a hammerhead beam is. He knows the environmentalist movement was pioneered by UVM alumnus George Perkins Marsh in his book Man and Nature, and that the first comedic play in the U.S., The Contrast, was written by Royall Tyler, a Vermont Supreme Court judge and university law professor. Perhaps the best trivia-quiz fodder Averyt gives us is the definition of a gnomonologist and where on campus such a person’s handiwork might be found. Hint: It tells time.
I wasn’t the only one enlivened by Averyt’s encyclopedic mind. Mary Wallack, from Washington, D.C., has come to drop off her daughter, Alexis Smith, for her junior year at UVM; she decided to take the tour after reading about it on a website for parents. “This is so much more detailed than other tours,” Wallack says.
Rocel Kingman, of Orono, Minn., has just moved her son, Ted, into the dorms and wants to give him time to get adjusted. The tour seemed like a good idea. “I didn’t want to hang around him. I wanted to do my own thing,” Kingman says. She declares herself impressed with the volume of information Averyt presents, especially the details about Billings Library and its namesake and patron Frederick Billings, a railroad developer and UVM alumnus for whom Billings, Mont., and Billings, N.D., were named. Kingman’s family has connections to Montana, so that part of the tour was particularly interesting, she says.
Averyt’s was an impressive display of tour-guidery. By the end of an hour and a half, my brain was bursting with nuggets of info. I now know where the Bittersweet got its name, who is buried behind Ira Allen Chapel and what the Boulder Honor Society was — at least until the next story assignment prompts me to forget.

Getting Published in Science:
First-Time Authors Share Their Stories
Matthew Lamanna was a 25-year-old graduate student, eating lunch outside in Spring 2001 when his research partner, Joshua Smith, shouted from a nearby window: "It's in! We're in Science!" Lamanna shouted back: "Oh man, wow!"
Their Science odyssey had begun when Smith was 29, and his head was hanging from a different window¾a Land Cruiser lost in Egypt's Bahariya Oasis, where he was collaborating with researcher Attia Yousry of the Egyptian Geological Museum. "Hey," Smith recalls saying, after spotting something in the sand, "that looks like a bone." It was a fossilized bone, in fact, from one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered.
Like Lamanna and Smith, Frank Heppner¾now four years from retirement at the University of Rhode Island¾also recalls being elated when, as a 27-year-old graduate student in 1967, his first paper was accepted by Science. "Are you kiddin' me?" he jokes, when asked if the publication helped propel his career. "A grad student with a paper in Science? It was worth gold. My memory isn't that good, but I imagine I did handsprings, screams of joy, whatever we did before high-fives."
First-time Science author, Cindy Van Dover, an assistant professor at the College of William & Mary, recalls watching the outline for two companion manuscripts emerge on a ship's blackboard, while she was completing field research in the Indian Ocean. "We knew we wanted to try for a Science type of manuscript¾a discovery paper," Van Dover says of her research on hydrothermal vent organisms. Her manuscript was ultimately delivered by satellite e-mail to the journal's online submission system, on 19 July 2001. It was accepted 30 working days later, on 31 August, and published online Science Express two weeks later, appearing in print on 26 October (vol. 294, issue 5543, pp. 818-823).
Van Dover considered other journals, but selected Science after talking with an editor about the journal's readership (more than one million people worldwide); illustration options; and print and online article word-counts. At about 4,400 words, including some 65 references and notes, her manuscript was submitted as a research article, which can include up to 4,500 words¾rather than a report, which puts the cap at 2,500 words, or a Brevia of fewer than 1,000 words.
Manuscript preparation meant a long stretch of all-nighters for Lamanna, Smith, and co-authors-supervised by veteran paleontologist Peter Dodson at the University of Pennsylvania. Because they were in Egypt, the two young scientists had a friend submit their work online, through the web submissions site, the method most preferred by Science editors, on 9 March 2001. Their paper was submitted in the category for research reports, running about 1,500 words, with 47 references and notes.
One of more than 7,000 manuscripts submitted to Science each year¾with 52 percent from countries beyond the United States¾the dinosaur paper was first evaluated by R. Brooks Hanson, Deputy Managing Editor in charge of physical sciences, who had talked with Smith by phone. Like about a third of all submissions, it got a preliminary pass from a manuscript editor¾in this case, Hanson, who felt it met Science's key conditions of acceptance, by revealing "a novel concept of broad importance to the scientific community," which had never previously been disclosed to the public. "We look initially for editorial and scientific integrity," Hanson explains. "We're looking for solid research that says something new."
Katrina Kelner, Deputy Managing Editor in charge of biological sciences, notes that many of the journal's finest papers have been "clever, elegant, basic biology," such as recent investigations of the structure of ribosome, the cellular protein factory. Roughly 60 percent of all published papers have historically fallen into the biological realm, she adds. "Not every paper makes it onto the front page of a major newspaper," she says. "But, they all must meet our criteria for originality, presenting a novel idea that's likely to stimulate further investigation or debate, maybe even a whole new way of thinking about an important question."
After determining that the sauropod paper met this standard, Hanson routed it to a Board of Reviewing Editors, assigned to assess the potential significance, quality and interest of submissions. One of about 100 leading, active scientists on the reviewing board again gave the paper a pass, noting that it revealed crucial new information about dinosaurs and where they lived in Africa.
Finally, the manuscript was assessed by anonymous peer reviewers, selected for their expertise in the field, who returned more good news.
On Friday, 1 June 2001, a report on Smith's discovery appeared in Science (vol. 292, issue 5522, pp. 1704-06), placing it among the 10 percent of all submissions annually accepted for publication. "I was really surprised with how fast the thing got turned around," Smith says of his experience, adding that "it was pretty bug-free, overall."
To ensure accurate news coverage, AAAS shared the research one week in advance with pre-registered journalists, but asked them to hold or "embargo" their stories until 2:00 pm Eastern Time on Thursday, 31 May. Thus, thousands of reporters worldwide had a week to understand the research and prepare their stories. Smith soon found himself wryly explaining to CNN correspondent Ann Kellan that Paralititan stromeri, the "tidal giant" he found fossilized in Egypt, was "a big boy."
As soon as the Science embargo lifted, news of Smith's find rapidly spread around the world. "I was completely stunned at the level of attention we got, and indeed, are continuing to get," he says. "We made something like 175 newspapers worldwide within the first 24 hours. I dealt with 30 to 35 calls a day for the week preceding the release of the story, and much of the week after. Matt and I were getting calls from every TV station in the country, it seemed. We learned very quickly how to deal with the media."
Because of the embargo system, most of the coverage was accurate, Smith says, although in hindsight, he wishes that his Egyptian collaborators had been featured more extensively in news reports.
Not all Science papers generate such broad news coverage. But, the AAAS provides journalists with a lay-language summary of every forthcoming research article¾not just the most easily accessible topics. And, information is disseminated to some 3,900 journalists registered to use the AAAS science news site, EurekAlert!
In keeping with the association's mission to enhance public understanding and appreciation of research, recent Science Press Packages have included, for example, a description of Marc Tatar's study of insulin-like receptors in fruit flies and their impacts on lifespan. For lay people, Tatar's research was complex, showing that flies with mutant receptors could live up to 85 percent longer. The work was covered by a half-dozen ambitious journalists, including one at The Financial Times of London, who reported on Tatar's "evidence of an ageing system that may promote long life."
Cindy Van Dover was preparing for the start of Fall classes when she got word of her paper's acceptance, following a review process that she describes as "extraordinarily professional." She was unprepared for the journal's new "just-in-time" rapid publishing schedule: "Who would expect to submit a major revision on a Friday afternoon, and learn on a Sunday morning that the manuscript was accepted!" she says. "Definitely a surprise."
Science Express, a new feature of Science and Science Online, permits rapid electronic publication of selected research papers and Perspectives, editor Katrina Kelner notes.
Why are some papers published first on Science Express, appearing a few weeks later in print? Editors evaluate the work's importance and timeliness, Kelner says. The online venue makes it possible to publish, for example, hot papers likely to turn a long-standing theory on its head, or findings with immediate public-health impacts, such as recent articles on the hoof-and-mouth epidemic in Great Britain. When such issues exist, Kelner notes, papers can be reviewed within days, and certain papers are published within 10 days of acceptance¾though most appear about 4 to 6 weeks after getting the green light.
Like Van Dover, author Marc Tatar also reports a good review experience in publishing his study: "The review process was very timely and efficient," he says. "The reviewers helped clarify some of the conceptual places that were muddy and identified places that needed strengthening."
Tatar chose Science because, he says, "the paper crossed a lot of different disciplines, from aging research to insect physiology, and we wanted to reach a broad audience." He also appreciated the journal's editorially independent status within the nonprofit AAAS, founded in 1848.
Science's long-standing reputation, as a journal established in 1880 by Thomas A. Edison, was the key for veteran Frank Heppner, too, who says he went with AAAS some 34 years ago for "the prestige, snob value, and career enhancement!"

Bravos for Social Media Bootcamp
Tons of transformational ideas, tools and Twitter tips highlighted the AAJA Seattle Spring Training Social Media and Self-Branding Bootcamp on March 28. Sona Patel, Lauren Rabaino and Brian Rosenthal of the Seattle Times did a dynamite job dishing out info and inspiration (plus a tour of the newly consolidated Times newsroom).
The talented trio asked us to blog about our five top takeaways. My list:
Interact. Subscribe to blogs. Follow people who are doing what you want to do.Â Comment on their posts. Lauren shared an anecdote from her student days how she posted on a Big-Shot Journalistâ€™s blog and he responded, much to her delighted astonishment. It marks you as someone who contributes to the discourse and helps establish you as a credible source of information.
Use your name or a consistent alias across all platforms. To build the brand, you need a unified naming convention on Twitter, your website, Facebook, LinkedIn.
Tweet where youâ€™re at. Beaming out that youâ€™re at a school board meeting, tech conference (or AAJA event!) builds credibility that youâ€™re covering whatâ€™s important, doing the footwork.
Donâ€™t sweat the SEO. People will find you if you write well about what matters to you, said Lauren. Brilliant strategy.
Always have visuals â€“ makes posts more shareable. To wit: Fueling up for the drive home to Bellingham, I stopped afterward at Molly Moonâ€™s Homemade Ice Cream for a triple hot fudge sundae (salted caramel, Scout mint and vegan coconut chunk!). Noticed they had a map showing their ingredientsâ€™ origin. Noticed their milk and cream come from the Edaleen Dairy in Lynden. Realized this would make a fun post on my Blue Ribbon blog about local food, farming and fairs. Also, realized, with regret, that a photo of the little thumbtack on â€œLyndenâ€ wouldâ€™ve made the post 10 times cooler. Hit home that I need to take my camera everywhere — even the malt shop.Posted in Members, Multimedia, Programs, Uncategorized | Tagged AAJA, AAJA Seattle, Edaleen Dairy, Molly Moon Ice Cream, Multimedia, socialmedia, training | Comments Off

Residents in Queensland's 73 councils go to the polls on Saturday, but many have already cast postal votes.
The Local Government Association of Queensland (LGAQ) says several shires will operate under a full postal system as there will be no polling booths.
The LGAQ says that means in close contests, it may take several days for the final outcome to be known.
LGAQ spokesman Greg Hallam says it will be up to the Electoral Commission of Queensland (ECQ) to declare winners.
"We are hoping that a lot of those results can be known," he said.
"Clearly though in a situation where the gap between the first and second candidates is in fact smaller than the outstanding postals, then the ECQ cannot declare that result.
"They have to wait the full 10 days or until such time as the gap between the candidates is greater than the outstanding postals."
Mr Hallam says the LGAQ wants councils to have the right to run its own elections in the future, not the ECQ.
He says councils want the ability to administer the elections themselves or employ a contractor.
"What we've seen in the two elections now, the costs have gone up ... [sometimes] 250 per cent increases and there's relatively high level of dissatisfaction," he said.
"From where we sit, I think they've certainly improved their game, but there are always going to be some inherent difficulties when they have dual responsibilities to the State Government and to local government."
Mr Hallam says there are also other problems with the current system.
"There's always going to be a concern when you have a body as big as the ECQ - and they have to do 73 elections - that there is some cross-contamination of the ballot," he said.
"There've been some stories already that have suggested that's happened.
"We strongly believe that councils should have the option of doing it themselves, using the ECQ or another contractor."

All of us who own stocks or stock funds are moaning and groaning about the 3-year-old bear market. But there's another group of sufferers: fixed-income investors, many of them elderly.
True, falling interest rates did push bond prices up last year. But many investors who owned bonds that matured or were called early saw their incomes plummet after they reinvested.
Today, you're lucky to make 2 or 3 percent on bank savings. If you're replacing a 10-year Treasury bond that just matured, your yield is dropping from 6.3 percent to 3.7 percent.
Is there a way a senior can make up the income gap?
One alternative: a reverse mortgage, a way to pull money out of your home without saddling yourself with monthly payments, as you would with a home equity loan.
While reverse mortgages are not suitable for everyone, low interest rates and rising home prices make them particularly attractive right now for those who can stomach the high up-front fees and compounding interest charges.
A 75-year-old who owns a $150,000 home could get a reverse-mortgage loan for nearly $98,000 today, compared to $84,000 when rates were 1 percentage point higher a year ago, for example.
Like, since the money is a loan rather than income.
The longer you have the loan, the more interest you would owe. But federal regulations limit the total amount owed to the value of the property. If the property value falls or if the homeowner lives to be very old, interest charges or money received on the monthly payment plan can exceed the property's value.
That, of course, is a risk that worries lenders. To reduce this prospect, they limit the initial loan amount, considering factors such as interest rates and the homeowner's life expectancy. (If you have a previous loan on the property, a portion of the reverse mortgage must be used to pay that off.)
Hence, the older you are, the more money you can get. A 62-year-old with a $150,000 home might get $83,000, while an 85-year-old could get $113,000.
In the same way, lower interest rates allow homeowners to lock in much larger loan amounts than they can get when rates are high. Once this loan amount is set, it is permanent, even if interest rates rise later. So it might pay to lock in now, while rates are low.
The interest charges applied to the loan float, changing either once a month or once a year. Typically, they are based on the rate paid by one-year Treasury notes, plus a "margin" of 1.5 percent or 2.1 percent, depending on whether the borrower chooses the monthly or annual adjustment. Currently, the combined rate on monthly adjustments, chosen by most borrowers, is 2.8 percent.
Although the homeowner doesn't make payments on the loan, low interest rates mean interest charges don't build up as much, so there's more money left for the homeowner or heirs after the loan is paid off.
What's the downside?
The biggest one is fees, which can run to thousands more than you might pay on an ordinary mortgage.
These include a fee of several hundred dollars to appraise the property, a loan origination fee of up to $2,000, an insurance premium paid at closing equal to 2 percent of the property's value, a monthly insurance premium that adds 0.5 percent to the loan rate and a monthly servicing fee of up to $35.
Another major drawback: Since the borrower doesn't pay interest each month, interest charges compound - you pay interest on interest. Hence, you might pay much more in interest than you would on an ordinary mortgage or home equity loan.
Hence, it often makes better financial sense to sell a home, buy a cheaper one and live off the difference. Or you might do better with an ordinary mortgage or home equity loan, assuming you have the income to qualify.
But a reverse mortgage can work well for an elderly homeowner who wants to stay in a home, can't borrow elsewhere, really needs the money and isn't concerned that compounding interest charges will chew away at the equity that can be left to heirs.
Be sure to do plenty of shopping around. The AARP has a good brochure that can be ordered at 1-800-424-3410 or viewed at. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which backs most reverse mortgages, has materials that can be ordered at 1-800-217-6970 or viewed at.
Also try the Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association at. Materials can be ordered at 1-866-264-4466.

BALTIMORE (WMAR) - Robert Gladden, the teen charged in Monday’s shooting at Perry Hall High School, has yet to appear before a bond court judge.
Court officials say Gladden is still undergoing psychiatric evaluation and will not appear in bond court until evaluations have been completed.
Many expected Gladden to appear before a judge Wednesday after attempted murder and assault charges against him were announced by officials Tuesday .
Investigators say Gladden brought a broken down shotgun to school on Monday, assembled it in a bathroom and then walked into the school’s cafeteria. A special needs student was shot and has been in critical condition at a local hospital since the incident.
The only court date currently on the books for Gladden is a preliminary hearing scheduled for September 7 at 8:30 a.m.
Students on Monday told ABC2 News reporters Gladden was bullied. They say he also provided what may have been a preview to the incident on his Facebook page. While investigators and school officials say they have not found any proof he was bullied, they admit social media is a part of their investigation.
Be sure to check back with ABC2 News as we continue to follow this story.

Cycling's governing body is removing
Lance Armstrong's name from the record books.
Armstrong, once considered to be the greatest cyclist in Tour de France
history, has been formally stripped of his seven titles and banned for life for
his alleged role in what is considered by U.S. authorities to be a massive
doping program.
In a news conference, Pat
McQuaid, president of the International Cycling Federation, said that "Lance Armstrong has no
place in cycling, and he deserves to be forgotten in cycling."
Evangelist Franklin Graham prayed on a sidewalk outside the Pentagon Thursday after his invitation to a prayer service inside was withdrawn because of comments that insulted people of other religions. More>>

The first names of those that will be speaking at the Republican National Convention have been officially announced, and with the announcement comes some raised eyebrows.
But it appears that not having your name on the list, doesn't necessarily mean you won't be speaking.
In fact, Alec Poitevint, Chairman of the Committee on Arrangements, says in the next few weeks we can expect more names to be added. He says the selection of the speakers is an arduous process filled with input from hundreds from various agencies, even general public opinion is considered.
Jim Davis, former Florida and United States Representative says history shows that if a name doesn't appear on the speaker list, there is a good chance they are still in the running to fill that Vice President candidate slot.
Either way, one thing is for sure, the GOP knows exactly what they are doing.
"This is all going to be very carefully calculated," says Davis.
Davis says the Republicans have a distinct plan as they strategically roll our the names of those that will be speaking at the RNC.
"I think that the Republican Party did two things today, both were wise. I think they touted out some of their best and brightest and they mixed into that some of the people that they have to ask to speak.
He adds he's not just looking at the names that have been introduced, but he says just as important, if not more, is when these people will take the podium. He says the prime time speakers will be the ones to watch, the ones the Republican party really want to showcase. As for those that have yet to be named?
"Many of these people that are being touted as Vice Presidential candidates are leaders in their own right. I think they will all be speaking in some way at the convention."
He says people like former Secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice will have a lot to bring to the table on hot-button issues like foreign policy.
People like Governor Rick Scott and Senator John McCain are more formalities, he says. Those two are more like a tradition because they won't help to swing the votes in his opinion.
Speakers like South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez will get the attention of the women voters as they both made history by becoming the first female governors in their respective states.
While we expect to hear more announcements on those who will be slated to speak, the question still remains, who will get the nod for Vice President?
Despite much conversation, Davis doesn't seem to think it will be Florida Senator Marco Rubio. He says he thinks the battleground state of Ohio will get the green light.
"Today, I put my money on Rob Portman," predicts Davis.
Portman, the junior state Senator from Ohio, has been really impressing people in the past couple of months, according to Davis..

Dotti Disposable Camera is the latest application from Sincerely Inc.’s developer team which is already a name that has created its mark among smartphone users with some wonderful apps like Postagram Postcards and Holiday Cards for Android and iOS. The base concept behind those previous two apps is simple, just personalize a postcard on your smartphone (with a photograph, style and message of your choice), print and sent it directly where you want it to be by postal code. Now the latest app, Dotti Disposable Camera converts your device into a classic disposable camera, complete with sound effects and animations, and allows you to fill its camera roll with almost 12 captured photos. While filling the roll with snaps, you'll be able to place its delivery order to an address as you like to get it. Every photo gets printed on 6x4 in. full quality fine paper and therefore the entire compilation gets delivered in an exceedingly solidly designed envelope to stay your snaps protected. Relying upon the target location, cargo charges and delivery time could vary.
The printed picture is standard size of 15x10 cm (6x4 inches). The set of 12 pictures will cost about $ 4.99 for delivery in the United States and $ 5.99 for the rest of the world - with an expected arrival within one week. To get double prints, you will need to pay a further $3.
With Dotti, you can create multiple albums. Click to photograph and observe the number of pictures remaining in the upper right corner of the screen. After the capture of each image you can choose whether to keep or discard the photo. When the film is ready, you can proceed to the registration information, address and payment.
Dotti Disposable Camera has a very unique software based on it’s concept. It leverages the high quality digital cameras of the iPhone and Android to produce printed albums. The app is very easy to use for delivery and the price is cheap for anywhere.
Although it has some drawbacks which should be added in future. Like Dotti does not store any of the images created through the app. Also, you can not choose different sizes of photos or send more than 12 images. Another thing to note that the application is a bit slow at the time of capturing images and do not have any options of editing, allowing only the user to enable or disable the camera flash. It would be even cooler to insert effects, cuts and changing colors in your photographs before sending the print request.
Dotti Disposable Camera is available for free in the iTunes App Store and Android Market. It needs Android 2.1 or higher and iOS 4.3 or later to run.

BY LARRY LAGE, AP Sports Writer
3:30 AM CST, January 3, 2011
DETROIT - Brett Favre lingered on the sideline during what was likely the last game of his 20-season career, often looking like he'd rather be lounging on a couch back home in Mississippi.
Now, he can.
The three-time MVP quarterback was inactive with a concussion, but walked onto the field briefly as his Minnesota Vikings teammates desperately tossed laterals to each other before running out of time and hope as the Detroit Lions won 20-13 Sunday.
When the game ended, the 41-year-old Favre jogged diagonally across the turf - waving once toward Detroit's sideline - with the only burst of energy he showed all afternoon and went up a ramp toward the locker room.
So long, Brett.
''I would have liked to have played,'' he said. ''The wise choice was not to play. I was OK with it.''
Favre said he passed a post-concussion test a couple days before the game, but getting knocked out for what he said was 10 or 15 seconds two weeks ago when Chicago's Corey Wootton slammed his helmet to the frozen turf seemed to scare him away from risking another head injury.
''It's been a wonderful ride for me,'' he said. ''One game, one season does not define me. There will be people saying, 'It's a shame he went out that way.'
The Lions (6-10), meanwhile, closed the season with a four-game winning streak, and tripled last season's win total. Shaun Hill threw for 258 yards and a touchdown, and Maurice Morris scored on a 4-yard run with 9:29 left to give the Lions a 10-point lead before the Vikings' Ryan Longwell kicked a 48-yard field goal with 1:55 left.
''We wanted to be remembered for the way we finished this season,'' second-year coach Jim Schwartz said. ''We beat three teams that were in the playoff mix, two of them on the road.''
The Vikings (6-10) ended a lost season by putting Favre on the inactive list, and with rookie Joe Webb making his second start.
They opened the season with Super Bowl hopes, but week after week of team turmoil took its toll, especially on Favre.
He sustained a series of injuries and wound up sitting out three of the Vikings' final four games. Adding to his misery, Favre was fined $50,000 on Tuesday for failing to cooperate with an NFL investigation into allegations of tawdry interactions with a game-day hostess when both worked for the New York Jets in 2008.
After his postgame news conference Sunday, Favre didn't answer a reporter who asked for his reaction to NFL's ruling.
The Vikings also fired Brad Childress during the tumultuous season, finishing with Leslie Frazier as interim coach, had a failed reunion with Randy Moss and two home game were moved because snow collapsed the Metrodome's roof and a blizzard pushed another game to a Tuesday night.
Team owner Zygi Wilf wouldn't discuss Frazier's future with the team after the finale.
Frazier said he planned to talk with ownership Sunday night or today.
''Nothing has been solidified,'' Frazier said.
Favre walked onto the Ford Field turf about 40 minutes before kickoff, looking much like he did Dec. 13 in the same stadium where his NFL-record, 297-game starting streak ended because of a banged-up right shoulder and numb right hand in a game against the New York Giants in the first of two relocated games.
He was wearing a purple knit hat, short-sleeved black shirt with a long-sleeved white shirt underneath and black warmup pants and was willing to talk to anyone who crossed his path. He later put on a baseball cap with a '4' on it, but covered all of it other than the bill - perhaps to avoid another fine from the league for wearing gear it hadn't approved.
During the game, Favre sometimes stood by himself and simply looked bored as a witness to a sport he played with so much joy and success since 1992 - his first season with Green Bay after being drafted by Atlanta.
Favre couldn't wait to get off the sideline for the final time.
Down by a touchdown, the Vikings got the ball back with 10 seconds left and made several laterals in an attempt to score.
Favre, who inched onto the field and had to be nudged back to the sideline when time ran out but the final play was still ongoing, dashed for the exit in what wasn't the way he wanted to go out.
He acknowledged some will doubt he's truly done after coming back from two retirements earlier in his career, but insisted this is it.
''It's time,'' Favre said.
Notes: Detroit avoided finishing alone in last for the first time in three years and put Minnesota in a last-place tie for first time since 1990. ... Lions Pro Bowl receiver Calvin Johnson was active, but didn't play because of his injured right ankle. ... Minnesota RB Adrian Peterson had 14 carries for 31 yards, falling 2 yards short of joining Earl Campbell as only players with at least 1,300 yards rushing and 10 touchdowns in their first four seasons. ... Lions RB Jahvid Best set a team rookie with 58 receptions and Brandon Pettigrew broke a franchise record for tight ends with 71 catches.

Ravens 33, Giants 14Ravens 33, Giants 14
Strategy: Offensive coordinator Jim Caldwell finally put his creative stamp on the offense, orchestrating season highs with 533 yards of total offense and 224 rushing yards. That included an option pitchout from Joe Flacco, getting Ray Rice isolated against slower linebackers to good effect, and selectively targeting suspect cornerback Corey Webster. Getting wide receiver Torrey Smith in single coverage against Webster was an effective gambit to gain separation. They used faster-developing plays. The Ravens used no-huddle 21 times and a shotgun formation 22 times out of 81 snaps. Of the Ravens' 10 longest plays, seven came out of no-huddle or shotgun looks. Defensive coordinator Dean Pees deployed his safeties as edge pass rushers to get a speed mismatch, lining up Courtney Upshaw at nose tackle to allow him to shoot gaps. Pees brought fire blitzes inside with linebackers Dannell Ellerbe and Brendon Ayanbadejo to disrupt Eli Manning.
Personnel: Ellerbe's return provided a boost to the defense. Ma'ake Kemoeatu started at nose tackle, but Terrence Cody played slightly better as Kemoeatu had little impact. James Ihedigbo started at strong safety with Bernard Pollard out again with damaged ribs. Ihedigbo had two quarterback hits. Chykie Brown proved capable in nickel duties, replacing Jimmy Smith. Right guard Marshal Yanda's presence upgraded the blocking, taking pressure off rookie Kelechi Osemele. Tight end Ed Dickson's return bolstered the offense.
What went right: Flacco was decisive and accurate, delivering the football with confidence and timing. He was 7-for-7 throwing to Anquan Boldin, 6-for-7 targeting Rice, 5-for-11 to Smith for 88 yards and a score and 4-for-5 to tight end Dennis Pitta. Flacco's quarterback sneak went for a touchdown this time instead of a fumble. The pass blockers improved, allowing no sacks and just two quarterback hits. Terrell Suggs' torn right biceps wasn't as problematic this game. Manning was sacked three times, and the Ravens had a season-high nine quarterback hits. Rice and rookie Bernard Pierce ran roughshod, each eclipsing 100 yards. Pierce displayed his speed on a career-long 78-yard run. Justin Tucker kicked four field goals.
What went wrong: Cary Williams had some coverage lapses, misplaying the ball. Ed Reed's high shoulder hit on Victor Cruz could be costly through a fine or even a suspension as the NFL regards him as a repeat offender. Upshaw and Josh Bynes were driven several yards backward on a touchdown run. Michael Oher managed to commit three penalties in one drive: a false start, holding and a personal foul.
Turning point: Rice sprinted away from overmatched linebacker Michael Boley, accelerating for a 27-yard touchdown reception that staked the Ravens to a commanding 24-7 lead before halftime.
X-factor: Torrey Smith's speed sets him apart, but his improved body control and hands are what allowed him to break out of a mini-slump. He had a slick one-handed sideline catch. Defenses will have to account for the former Maryland standout during the playoffs.
Strategy: Bengals offensive coordinator Jay Gruden loves to have Andy Dalton throw deep to ultra-talented wide receiver A.J. Green. Green was targeted 18 times and made 10 receptions for 116 yards, with one of those catches setting up the game-winning field goal. Green is one of the most gifted young players around, the prototypical go-to guy. Wide receivers Marvin Jones and Andrew Hawkins and big tight end Jermaine Gresham are complementary options for Dalton, who's willing to take chances and paid the consequences with two interceptions and six sacks while launching 41 passes Sunday. Cincinnati had to abandon an unproductive running game. The Bengals have a formidable defensive front, and Mike Zimmer doesn't need to call blitzes constantly. He can rely on the considerable talents of star defensive tackle Geno Atkins — one of the best young defensive linemen in the NFL — and athletic, rangy defensive ends Michael Johnson and Carlos Dunlap. Zimmer is regarded as somewhat unpredictable and will bring safety and cornerback blitzes on occasion.
Personnel: Gritty left tackle Andrew Whitworth isn't that quick, but he has a strong hand punch and a good track record of stonewalling Terrell Suggs. Kevin Zeitler is a stout rookie guard, a powerful drive blocker. Gresham is a difficult assignment because he resembles a power forward. Atkins is a relentless combination run-stopper and pass-rusher with 13 sacks and four forced fumbles. He gave Matt Birk fits in September, and the ravens will need to build an effective game plan to prevent him from creating penetration. Linebacker Rey Maualuga has dropped 20 pounds to upgrade his mobility. Linebacker Vontaze Burfict has matured. He's operating with a serious, no-nonsense approach nowadays, and it shows in his play.
What went right: Green and Dalton built a good rhythm. Jones provided a shifty change of pace downfield. The defensive line got a lot of push, shooting gaps. The secondary prevented Ben Roethlisberger from striking deep. Leon Hall read his keys to pick off Roethlisberger for an interception that he returned for a touchdown. Roethlisberger completed only half his throws for one touchdown with two interceptions, resulting in 10 points and a low 58.6 quarterback rating.
What went wrong: Dalton held the football too long, resulting in some coverage sacks. He didn't always make good decisions on when to give up on a play. He was intercepted twice by Cortez Allen, who's usually an easy mark. The running game got obliterated, as "The Law Firm," BenJarvus Green-Ellis was handcuffed for 14 rushing yards on 15 carries for a 0.9 average. Dick LeBeau's run blitzes were effective. A holding penalty negated Jones' long punt return.
Turning point: Josh Brown kicked a 43-yard field goal with four seconds remaining to seal a 13-10 win and the sixth seed in the AFC playoffs for the Bengals. It was set up by Reggie Nelson's picking off an overthrown pass intended for Mike Wallace and Dalton's 21-yard sideline completion to Green to position Brown for the game-winner.
X-factor: Dalton performed some of his best work in clutch moments. Shaky earlier in the game, Dalton completed nine of 13 passes for 107 yards in the fourth quarter with one interception. He connected with Green for five completions for 78 yards in the final quarter.

I had adventures today!
First – I went to this clothing swap. You bring in some old clothes and you get to leave with new old clothes. I am, admittedly, a horrible packrat. I’m so bad at throwing things away. With clothes, I’m basically saving things for three reasons:
1. Nostalgia. The t-shirt Ian bought for me that says “Abortion Tickles” (romantic!), the my “Senior Women” tshirt from high school with the nickname on the back that no one ever really called me, etc.
2. In case Lauren has stylish kids. This is, in other words, the “in case it comes back into style” excuse, but that never actually happens. By the time a style comes back into style, it’s just slightly different enough that the genuine old stuff looks weird and ugly. Unless! You’re super-stylish. So in case Lauren’s daughters are super-stylish, or I guess Jen and Vivid Boobie’s, or whoever else wants to have daughters that they allow me to hang out with, I’m saving my furry red polyester tank top, and my pleather pants, and my black pleather-snakeskin cowboy hat. (Why all the pleather? I had frankly not noticed that before.)
One thing I need save no longer, for any reason: My hot-pink tube top.
Oh – I’m sorry. Is hot pink a little too much for you? Well, good thing this baby is reversible!
We got us some soft pink, too, for that innocent look. In fact, the straps are even removable, in case it’s too conservative for you as-is.
True story: the last time time (the only time, I swear to god, really, I promise, if it helps) I wore this shirt (“shirt”) was to the Granada with my sister and one of her douchebag boyfriends. If you’re not from Kansas, you might not realize all that saying “I wore a hot pink tube top to the Granada with my older sister” means, but trust me, it’s not good news. If it helps you to understand the situation a little better, let me add: I wore it with the pleather snakeskin cowboy hat.
I took a picture of myself with the hat, too, but I just cannot bring myself to post it.
Jesus christ – I’m sitting here remembering that I admitted to a student a week or two ago that I have a blog. Dear Student, PLEASE DO NOT FIND MY BLOG PLEASE. Love, Jessica’s Tube Top. Screw the shot of me ferociously sucking Nutella off the blade of a knife; screw the shot of me with a giant beet stuck in my front teeth. These two pictures are officially tied for Most Embarrassing Photo of Jessica, Ever. Why on earth do I keep putting this shit on the internet? I don’t have to do this. Why did I do this? Even as I type this I am realizing I could, theoretically, not post this. And yet.
Anyway – got rid of the tube top today at the swap. Traded it in for various other things I will likely never wear, either, including some kind of wacky Brit Pop military jacket that’s two sizes too big, and a ratty Kurt Cobain sweater with a hole in it that I bought imagining I would throw it on in case I’m like, out at the beach for a picnic or a clam bake or a bonfire party or something and it starts to get chilly at night. …You know. For all of the picnics and clam bakes and bonfire beach parties that I go to all the time. Also this dress, which I can’t tell if it’s like Twiggy-cute, or 15-year-old-at-the-mall-not-cute. My face looks like this because Erwin has just jumped up onto the table and is about to rub his face against my barely-balanced camera and knock it over:
I hosted two big swaps every year at home. I don’t think i’ll ever get new clothes again ever, now that i can’t get them for free.

One of the most winning and storied bikes in modern racing, the Pinarello Prince has more Grand Tour wins to its name than any other model of bicycle we can think of (True that Lance and Contador have won all their Tours on a Trek, but there have been a few different models in there.)
The third generation of a frame that was originally developed in the mid-1990’s, the 2008 Prince frame has a weight of well under a kilo, but maintains stiffness and razor sharp handling thanks to near magical CAD work by Pinarello’s engineering team and its Torayca Japanese 50K composite material. If you’re reading this though, you probably already know how incredible the Prince is; Bicycling magazine has gushed over this beauty a number of times.
We’d love to see this 55cm Prince find a new kingdom so we can make room for a new project bike. Built with Shimano Dura-Ace 7900 group including Dura-Ace 7850 tubeless road wheels, this yellow Prince also features the company’s stand-out M.O.st Talon Compact integrated carbon handlebar and stem and M.O.st carbon seatpost as well as a Fizik Arione CX saddle.
The first $8700 takes it and, as with all of our project bikes, we’re happy to swap a part or two if it’ll make the bike work better for you.If you're interested give us a call @ 415.389.5461, email or come by the shop.
By the way, these and many of our incredible photos are by local lensmen Dean Bentley. Soon enough we'll do a feature on Dean and his work. Stay tuned.

a couple more points, you're forgetting that she first said the light wasn't a lampost and the lampost was behind her, maybe....maybe not has already proven there was no lampost behind her until the roundabout. after this was pointed out and the orange light was also shown to be a lampost she then spoke privately to a member and told him/her that yes it could have been, but when people picked up on this she came back on here defending herself that it wasn't a lampost. that is not consistent....
and as far as the reflection goes, i really dont think anyone now needs an expert to show that those reflections are almost identical in those pictures that someone posted, anyone can see it with their own eyes, and because those two things have been pretty much proven, the whole story has tumbled like a house of cards.
thanks

Please don't elude to what I might or might not be forgetting. You're starting to act arrogant..
The lamp post to her, was irrelevant. But it turns out (due to her photos) it's become a focal point. It's really crappy luck to her but.......it's happened.
There is a chance, she took the photo of this lamp post (that wasn't in the forefront of her mind that evening) at the SAME time, this second object appeared.
She didn't notice it because her mind (and what she thought her camera was doing) was fixed to this flying (not a dead bug) object.
It COULD have happened that way.

Have you not ever wondered if maybe you are to blame for being here? Why would you be here in this awful world.. at this time? Something you may have done to trap you here for one lifetime, maybe many?
Is anyone to blame?
Did you come here to experience creating in the material because you chose to? As in.... your choice before you were formed in this material world? A lot of ancient texts say we did, including Genesis.
Jesus is our collective story.. the sum of man's story. He is the first and last Adam.

What a weekend! Fredericksburg is a great get-away and this wonderful experience we had was so much more enjoyable because of your special attention to detail. This amazing cottage that has your special touch, along with its indulgent pleasures, was a place we'll never forget. Thank you for making lifetime memories for our anniversary! We had a wonderful time and will recommend you to everyone to share this romantic place. We'll definitely come back! To sum up our stay in a few words...Ooh La La!
Kristi and Kirby
We had a wonderful time staying in your beautiful cottage. The food and complimentary wine were fantastic. The quiche was terrific. Every detail was perfect and more than we could have asked for. We will recommend your place to all of our friends and family.
Corey and Sherry
I just wanted to let you know that our visit totally exceeded our expectations.
The Hot Tub is an outdoor room that is totally built out with walls, a door, pictures on the website do not match what loveliness and roominess we found when we visited the Hot Tub Room.
The accommodations exceeded our expectation tremendously as well as the service provided by Laura. She was so lovely and so helpful giving us hints maps and expertise in where to go in the area.
During our stay we opted to have a lovely Brunch instead of the full breakfast we were offered (since we sleep in) that consisted of a gorgeous Cobb Salad with Mimosa's and Shrimp Cocktail. That was aside from the first day of fresh muffins, fruit, and quiche that was already in our room.
Our stay was so relaxing we were not ready to leave. Laura's attention to detail delighted us both each little surprise she left us, each bottle of wine made the trip a complete delight. Laura's decorating skills were marvelous and the beautiful French cottage could not have been more comfortable. We cannot wait to go again.

Ooh La La!!!! That's what guests say when they step into Ooh La La's romantic Paris Cottage! The first thing you may notice is the stunning, romantic decor centered around a beautiful tiled gas fireplace. The comfortable den is just perfect for putting your feet up, enjoying a glass of wine and catching up on everything you've been missing in today's busy world. Downstairs you will also find a kitchenette with all the conveniences and a fabulous Paris-themed bath.
The center-piece of this bath is the oversized whirlpool tub for two! Slip into the hot soothing bubbles and let the cares of the world melt away. Upstairs in the romantic open loft you will find a gorgeous king size bed. Vintage European touches pull together the high-end feel of this spectacular cottage.
Be sure and save time to enjoy a long soak in the screen-porched hot tub, while at the same time watching, get this, a 50" Flat Screen TV right there on the porch! Are you kidding me? A good hot tub is just the ticket after hitting the shops and sights of town, and you don't have to miss the ball game either! (Do remember you're on vacation, though. There are more important things than TV!)
Outside you will enjoy the beautifully landscaped garden with fountain and your own porch with two rockers, just perfect for solving the world's problems. Make Ooh La La - Paris Cottage your little love-nest the next time you head to the Hill Country!

I have had no issues with this product, I believe it doesn't get better than this other than being powered by its own water instead of electricity. I have had this product once before and returned it from another store thinking I didnt need it in my new home. I was wrong and had mold issues in my basement. I looked all over for this product and most places carry the hier brand which most people rate very low and have issues. ABT carries this this higher quality dehumidifier in which I was also glad to find it on sale when I bought it. This is a well designed product for the money..

The most important thing for me (and most) is a front intake and a top exahust. A 65 pint unit has to pull air from a large space, or multiple rooms. It is important it pulls from the front. As for exauhst, blowing out the sides or rear could potentially blow into a wall, or onto someone that is seated near by. Exhausting upwards never creates a problem. I had a 65 pint Fedders/Maytag before this. The only other model I have seen with front intake and top exhaust. It had two digital displays, one for your humidity setting, one for the actual humidity. The GE unit only has one display that toggles. The Maytag unit also had a one hour shut off or pause feature. The GE does not. I am trying to dehumidify a finished 900sqrft basement, that gets between 50-70% humid in the summer. The Maytag's lowest setting was 35%. The Maytag was 65pt as well, and at the most humidy could bring the space's humidity level down to 35% and shut off. The GE at the most humidy time a year in the basement can only get to 39 or 40% dry when running continuously in the same space. Both are 65pt/day capacity, but the Maytag had a bit more drying power. I can live with 40-45% humidity though in the basement, so I guess the GE still does ok for my application, I would have liked it to be able to take the 900sqrft to 35% humidity though during humid months, it validates it is enough dehumidifier for the space. The downside to the Maytag/Fedders is that it broke after a year (as many others have as well). Fedders got out of this business, as has Maytag, and they are not repairing or honoring the warranty on broken units that still should be covered. The GE is the only 65 pint front in take top exhaust unit I have seen that is still on the market. If its reliability holds up it will be the best unit out there. Apparently dehumidifiers must be tough to make reliable. Almost all brands out there seem to have repair issues. If this one holds up it will be well worth the money. The GE also heats a big space, taking my 68 degree basement to 77 degrees over the entire 900sqrft. The Maytag took the basement temp up to only 74 degrees. The GE does have a larger tank capacity 21 pints vs 17 pints, less trips to the sink. It also has an indicator on the bucket that shows you how close to full you are, pretty handy. I would give it 3 1/2 stars, but the rating only allows for 3 or 4 stars.ABT had the best price, excellent customer service, and shipped it to me right away. Their return policy is also top notch, they take the risk out of buying online. I would highly recommend them.

Comments about GE AHM65LK Light Gray 65 Pints Energy Star Dehumidifier:
I owned one and went to buy a second one but the local store no longer carried GE. WHAT A MISTAKE! I am glad I found a GE dealer through the web site and I bought my second unit. The competitor's model is sitting in the garage. I'm sticking with GE.
Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

GE Dehumidifier (AHM65LK, 65 pt.)
By Rich
from De Queen, AR
This model works great for my humid garage. Living in the South, humidity is a problem and it makes my garage floor condensate. GE's dehumifier works great to control the problem. It's relatively quiet and quickly takes moisture out of the air.
You should get one.

Reviews of this GE model and ABT reputation brought me to this purchase. [...] and the product has to be THE best on the market. Quiet, adjustable fan speed, not much heat generated, and the controls are easy to operate. Get one. It's been the so quiet I almost forgot that it came.
Works well

65 pint GE Dehumidifier
By Joe
from Cleveland, OH
I have to agree with the other reviewer. I also had a Maytag dehumidifier which worked well but only last 3 yrs. I was unable to get the product repaired. This unit is similar to the Maytag 65 pint unit but does not dry as much as the Maytag did. Mind you, it does work well but has to be set to 40% humidity for the unit to shut off automaticly. AT 35% it will run continuously. It works, and keeps the basement dry but less powerful than the Maytag. [...] Good Luck.
so far so good

I haven't owned it that long and I have set it up to drain into a drain. It seems to do the job and I know that consumer reports rated it high.
Exactly what I was looking for!!
By denise
from staten island, ny
I purchased this dehumidifier for my unfinished basement. This product works great at getting rid of that musty cellar smell. I put it on continous for one day and it dropped the humidity reading from 60 to 30 in 24 hrs. It works great for use in a cellar. It isn't too noisy, in fact it is quieter than the one had previously owned, but I wouldn't recommend it for an area you are actually in all the time. I would definitly recommend this to a friend.

Terrific product[...]
By Carol the do-it-your-selfer
from Marcellus, NY
It does an excellent job removing basement dampness. Managing the water bucket is a little awkward, since even slow emptying allows water to spill over the top from a separate compartment. It also gets quite heavy, but removing it when it's not full allows water to continue collecting without the pan there to catch it. All things considered, I'd buy it again.
exactly what I needed
By crossword addict
from Chicago, IL
I have basement that sometimes leaks. I need an automatic drying machine, and I just set this one in the middle of the floor and turned it on. I could not get the plastic bypass tube on far enough that the hose fitting would lie flush against the side of the unit, so I just left the hose coupling unmounted. No problem so far; drains fine.

Ryan Lochte Talks Dating, Marriage Plans & His Mom’s ‘One-Night Stand’ Comment
First Published: August 3, 2012 4:59 PM EDT Credit: Getty Images
LONDON, England --
Caption Ryan Lochte of the United States after winning Gold in the Final of the Men’s 400m Individual Medley on Day 1 of the London 2012 Olympic Games at the Aquatics Centre on July 28, 2012Ryan Lochte’s dating life might be prompting more headlines than his medal count (an impressive two gold medals, two silvers and a bronze), and Access Hollywood’s Billy Bush chatted with the Olympic star in London where he dished on his love life.
“I love ladies, yeah, of course,” Ryan, who celebrates his 28th birthday on Friday, said when asked about his reputation as a ladies’ man.
He might be single now, but Ryan is looking ahead to a life with a wife and children.
“Now that the games are all said and done, I definitely want to get married and have kids and start a family of my own,” he said. “Not right this second.”
So what kind of woman catches the swimmer’s eye?
“They have to be able to make me happy. Make me happy, keep a smile on my face and I got to be able to trust them,” he explained. “That’s who I’m going to settle down with and start a family with.”
Ryan also cleared up comments his mom made on Thursday, where she said he’s been known to have “one-night stands.”
“She meant that I go on dates… not… one night stands, not that,” he told Billy. “I’ve been in long-term commitment relationships before. And, you know what? I really wanted to give these four years to push… I wasn’t really committed into a relationship. I just kind of went on dates.”
And the Olympian couldn’t be prouder of the commitment he made.
“I’m at the Olympics. I’m representing my country. That’s something I’m really proud of,” he told Billy. “And I’m coming home with five Olympic medals, so I’m thrilled about that.”

Improving Executive Team Performance
Team negotiating - A horse of a different color - Six steps to improving your team's performance
One of the most important, yet underdeveloped, responsibilities of an executive team is negotiation. It is surprising how much time is actually spent persuading and influencing each other and others on major executive decisions. While the individual team members are generally highly knowledgeable about the company's technical issues, and individuals may be good intuitive negotiators, as a team they often fall short. By following the six recommendations below, an executive team can go from an average negotiation team one to a well-oiled machine.
1. Get the team trained in the fundamentals. Many of you may have learned first to negotiate in a haggling fashion -- you start high, I start low and we meet in the middle. Later, you may have been exposed to some form of a "win-win" approach. Unfortunately, individuals on a team may have totally different definitions of negotiating well. Have the team briefed on negotiation fundamentals. Having a common language will increase efficiency and effectiveness. Make sure that whatever system you utilize emphasizes interests: the needs, desires, wants and fears of the various parties. When many levels are involved, focusing on specific demands is a trap that leads to confrontation rather than collaboration. Emphasizing interests will help parties move towards mutually satisfactoryagreements.
2. Standardize preparation. Related to the training is creating a template and mindset for preparing and reviewing negotiations. Before a major negotiation, the individuals involved should present the major interests as stated above. Next, start generating creative options to meet those interests. Rather than focusing on the single right answer, brainstorm broadly to come up with solutions that meet a variety of needs. Third, think about the walk-away alternatives. If there is no agreement, what will the parties do?
3. Create clear goals and parameters. Every team member has a duty to push hard on these issues. The only way any individual or any team will be successful is if they know what the bottom line objectives are. Checking your assumptions of what success will look like in negotiation is critical. Also, the individuals heading off to a negotiation need to know the level of authority and parameters they can operate within. The biggest nightmare is when you've made an agreement that your executive team members criticize as something you weren't supposed to do.
4. Increase the learning curve. After major negotiations, spend time as a team making enhancements. For more minor situations, review on your own or with a colleague or friend. See your team members as coaches. Ask yourselves these two basic questions: a. What worked well? b. What might we have done differently? The purpose is to continually learn and get better. Negotiation provides a wonderful opportunity. Because you negotiate all the time, you have lots of real-time data to reflect upon to continually improve. But improvement doesn't happen automatically. It requires discipline, a team culture and individual mindsets for doing so.
5. Enhance the comfort level within the team. The more relaxed a team is the better it will perform. Before a major negotiation, give the negotiators a chance to kick back and rest as much as possible. Doing "dry-runs" can simulate the real thing so the negotiators will be ready for anything. Role-play your counterparts so your team will be better prepared to respond to the other side. Ask the negotiators what they need to be comfortable and confident going into a negotiation.
6. Negotiate inside out. The bottom line is that an executive team that does not negotiate well internally will run into huge problems with external negotiations. For example, if the executive team cannot agree on its growth strategy, the organization may grind to a halt or play out different individual's strategies rather than a consensus. The more your own house is in order, the better you can deal with outsiders. Conflict here is a chance to work them through to gain the hidden opportunities and values that exist. Too often executive teams avoid conflict for the sake of superficial harmony.

Q&A with Simon Wright of Dio Disciples on ‘The Very Beast of Dio Vol. 2,’ AC/DC
Taken from Examiner.com by Simon Wright - read the full article HERE
A drummer since age 13, Simon Wright grew up on legends like Cozy Powell, John Bonham and Tommy Aldridge. He had barely entered his twenties when he joined AC/DC for the rest of the ’80s, then shifted over to Dio, the massive metal band formed by the late Ronnie James Dio, who previously lent his soaring voice and pen to bands like Black Sabbath and Rainbow (and popularized the “metal horns” gesture along the way).
Wright is currently a member of Dio Disciples, a celebration of the music and legacy of the eponymous frontman, who passed away from stomach cancer in 2010. Featuring distinguished Dio alumni (Craig Goldy and Scott Warren) along with Tim “Ripper” Owens (Judas Priest, Iced Earth), Oni Logan (Lynch Mob) and Bjorn Englen (Yngwie Malmsteen), the band kicks off their US tour Oct. 20 at the House of Blues Anaheim in support of the new Dio release The Very Beast of Dio Vol. 2, which picks up where the original gold-selling release leaves off and includes Dio’s final studio recordings.
In this exclusive interview, I spoke with the Manchester native about his introduction to Dio while touring in Italy, a surprising AC/DC reunion that happened a few years back, and his eloquent account of the man known as Ronnie James Dio.
What kind of involvement did you have with the release of The Very Beast of Dio Vol. 2?
The main body of involvement was done by Wendy [Dio] and her office manager Dean Schachtel. It’s a retrospective of the years between 1996 through the 2000s, [representing] the albums Angry Machines, Magica, Killing the Dragon and Master of the Moon. I saw the list and I thought, that’s a pretty strong list. There’s some really great songs on there that stand the test of time, you know?
What were some of your highlights of being a member of Dio?
Oh, there were so many - I was in his band 13 years. Working with him in the studio was great, just being around and seeing how it works and seeing how things developed and evolved, that was really cool. He had a great sense of which direction he was going to go in. And I guess live, we did a show in Germany= - I do refer to this quite a lot, but it was such a brilliant outing. I forget the year, you must forgive me, but it was in Wacken, in Germany, a festival we headlined, and at the end they presented Ronnie with a longevity award contribution to heavy metal, and it was just incredible - 40,000 people are chanting “Dio.” He was very proud, and we all were very proud of him. Hell of a night, fantastic show.
What was your personal introduction to Ronnie James Dio?
I first met him in 1985 when I was in AC/DC. There was a festival called Monsters of Rock, and up until then it had only been in England. And this particular one they decided to put it on in Italy and Greece, I think. Ronnie and Dio were on the Italian show [which was held in 1987—ed.], and I got to hang out with him afterwards and we sat down and I was talking and chatting with him, and I just found him to be a real gentleman, a really smart guy. A great sense of humour, too. And I met him a couple of times after that at parties, social gatherings and stuff, and the opportunity came around at the end of ’89. I got to move on from AC/DC and actually join his band, and I was very proud of that fact. It was a great time.
I read you joined AC/DC at age 20, is that right?
I was actually towards the end of being 19. But yeah, I was pretty young (laughs).
What was that experience like, and what was it they liked about you when they really could have picked anyone in the world at that point to be their drummer?
I don’t know what they liked about me; they never said (laughs). I heard a lot of drummers auditioned for that. They didn’t say who they were in the advertisement in the paper. I don’t know; something clicked. Maybe it was my height, you know? (Laughs) I’m not the tallest guy in the world, and neither are they. I really, really, don’t know. I just went in and played to three tracks, and they weren’t there—the drum tech was doing all the auditions because I think there were so many of them, and I ended up getting the job and just took it from there. They’re such down to earth people; it was great. I’ll never forget the ride they took me on.
How was your drum style implemented in AC/DC?
Before I got the job, I didn’t really change much from the way that I’d been playing. I’d mainly been playing in cover bands, only doing a couple of originals like most bands start out. But I knew their songs, and it’s just so apparent that you can’t go in there and try to change them and do drum fills everywhere, because that’s not the style of the way the band was, so I was very aware of that, even though I didn’t know who the band was when I was auditioning. I just did what I did—I went in there and they saw something and I got the job, you know? It’s a mystery, but I’m glad it happened, obviously.
In 1998 you played on Thunderbolt, an AC/DC tribute album. What kind of style did you bring to the session for that one?
If I remember right, I think I did “Hell Ain’t a Bad Place to Be” and “Night Prowler.” [It was] no different than what I’d already do…I think it would be blasphemy to play all over those songs, because I think Phil Rudd [Wright’s predecessor in AC/DC] did such a good job, you know? He’s as solid as solid can be. I just looked at it from that point of playing: you know, just be solid and just keep it pretty straightforward, really.
I don’t suppose you’d like to talk a little bit about the Flick of the Switch tour? I personally love that album, though you didn’t play on the record.
It was my first tour; that was my first tour that I did with them. I just remember the first show—it was in Vancouver, a place called Saddledome. It was so low-key, apart from the part there was like 22,000 people there. That’s just the way they worked things; they kind of made it really comfortable before I played and all. And I was under a little bit of pressure there for a show—I’d never heard that kind of noise come out of people before; it was like a jet engine. I wouldn’t say it was easy, but it was more comfortable than I thought it would be, because they just treated it like was a rehearsal, but with 20,000 people there. They’d give me a pat on the back and off we’d go, you know?
Is it true that AC/DC always plays “The Jack” at every show?
Pretty much every show that I did with them, if I remember right, yeah. It’s such a great song and you get the crowd involved with it, too. Back in the days they’d all pull out their lighters. It was a sight, and it was amazing. Great song.
Is there any official reason why the ’74 Jailbreak EP was released?
I’m not really sure. I wasn’t really a part of any decisions with regards to record releases. That was the record company and the original guys who were in the band.
Your first album with the band was 1985’s Fly on the Wall. With all due respect to singer Brian Johnson, his voice never sounded the same again since then. Can you comment on this?
I guess his voice did change a little bit. I think it’s still strong, but strong in a different kind of raspier way. I did notice that myself, but I don’t know what it is. It must be, just, this is what happens when you grow up and your voice matures, you know? That’s the only thing I can say, and I’m trying to be polite about this. But I still think his voice is strong, even today (laughs). He’s a good lad.
All that screaming and shouting that he did over the years has got to be murder on the vocal cords.
Justin, two and a half hours every single night, I mean, wow. You can’t knock the guy (laughs).
I thought he sounded great on the last record they put out, Black Ice. From what I read, he was doing a lot of vocal training with the producer, Brendan O’Brien, and he sounded great live.
Yeah. I saw him on that last tour, too. He sounded really strong.
I met him at his book signing in New York; he’s a great guy. I hope he does it for 100 more years.
Me, too. You’re right; he is a good guy. One of the good ones.
I’ll close the book here on Acca Dacca. Do you still keep in touch with any of the members at this point?
Not directly, no. They’ve got their thing to do and I kind of do mine. I did see them; I got coerced into going to see them on their Black Ice tour. Their first leg when they came through Los Angeles, they played at the Forum, and I went down and I was speaking with Mal[colm] and Angus [Young] and Cliff [Williams] and met Phil Rudd again; I’d only met him once before briefly, but that was cool. Chris Slade [Wright’s successor in AC/DC] was actually there, as well, so that was cool.
Would you be open to performing with them again for a special occasion if asked?
I don’t know about that. If they asked me, I probably would give it a go, yeah. That would be great; I’d give that a shot. I mean, If Phil couldn’t do it for some reason or if they asked me, I’d give it a shot.
What made you decide to leave AC/DC to join Dio?
I’d been in DC eight years, and I just needed to further my drumming a little bit. I’m not taking anything from AC/DC—they’re a brilliant and awesome rock and roll band, but drumming-wise it was a little bit straightforward, four on the floor, and I needed to kind of spread my drumming wings a little bit, just branch out a little bit. And luckily, I ended up being in Ronnie’s band, and he just was kind of like, go for it, try this, try that. He gave me a lot more free rein to experiment a little bit, which was what I really felt I needed, you know? I’d become a little complacent in [AC/DC], and there was absolutely no room for that.
As a member of Dio, you had two separate tenures in the band, both times replacing Vinny Appice. What was it like having that unique experience?
It was fantastic. The first time was a little more hectic because when I first joined Dio, the whole band was new. He had a brand new band—Rowan Robertson on guitar, Teddy Cook on bass and Jens Johansson on keyboards, and I think there was a little bit of pressure and a little bit of small worry. We sounded great, we were doing okay, but it was like a brand new band for him. The songs were still his songs, still his stuff for the new album and all, but that was the difference. When I rejoined again in ’98 after just leaving UFO—I was in UFO for three years before that, that kind of fell apart—rejoining Ronnie was like putting some old shoes on again that were really comfortable, that’s what that was like. And I went in and I knew the songs—a couple of new things I had to learn; they had created some new endings to songs and new beginnings and stuff like that, but it was just great to get back. I stayed in his band for 13 years after that. I was real happy being in Dio.
What made it such an enjoyable experience for you?
There was always kind of work to do. There was always thought behind what we were doing. There was always creativeness going on. Even when we were playing a set, at the end of the set at the end of the show, Ronnie would come in with ideas for different endings and stuff that we’d have to do the next night, so it was constantly changing and stuff, and there were new little pieces. It was very challenging, but at the same time it was very enjoyable, because you were kind of involved in the music constantly, you know, which I thought was really cool, I really enjoyed that part of it, you know? As well as all the camaraderie and stuff like that. All the people that have been involved with Dio were all cool people, so it was a great time.
A lot has been said about the theatricality of Dio’s stage performances and videos. Did you have any favorite moments among these?
Not one; I couldn’t pin down one. Ronnie was just a really great showman. We had a huge set when I first joined the band for Lock Up the Wolves. We had the bones and the 14-foot drum riser with a keyboard riser, too. That looked pretty awesome. But I think it’s just something about the way Ronnie would handle an audience that was really important—the effects were there, but he had a great way of communicating with the audience and bringing people into the show and making them feel like they’re part of it; he had a great way of doing that. That really always inspired me. He was a constant showman, you know? He was just great at it.
A lot of Dio’s lyrics were all about “we.” How did they help connect with the audience?
That was his specialty; that was his forefront. I’m sure other people will attest to this. If you ever met him, he brought you in. He had a way about him, and he was such a good listener, and he had this incredible memory. And I think all of these attributes that he had just brought out these amazing lyrics he would write, because he had feelings for other people. He thought about other people and their situations and stuff, and I think this was all a big combination that he would come up with songs like “The Last in Line” or “Invisible,” all these brilliant songs he’s done. He just has a way of bringing people in and making people feel a part of his songs, because his songs were so relatable—they could be about you or a group of people thinking about somebody else. It was just a great way of penmanship he had; just amazing. That’s not bad for a drummer, is it? (Laughs)
It’s been more than two years since he left us. If you could take us back to 2010, when was the last time you spoke with Ronnie?
(Pause) I was at the hospital. I don’t want to talk about that.
That’s fine.
Thanks.
What do you remember the most about him, summing it all up?
He was just an amazing man. I mean, he was a gentleman; he was a scholar and a poet. Everybody who’s met him is just so in awe of him. He was such a humble man as well—he really understood people’s feelings, and on top of that he was just a brilliant songwriter and an amazing voice. I can’t say enough about him, it’s just brilliant. I really miss him.
What can fans expect from the U.S. Dio Disciples tour?
We’re going to be playing songs off this Dio release, The Very Beast of Dio Vol. 2, so we’re looking forward to playing some of those songs, and we’re going to be playing the classic stuff as well—that’s going to be your “Heaven and Hell,” “We Rock,” “Rainbow in the Dark.” There’ll be some Sab stuff in there, too, and also some Rainbow songs. We try to fit as many of Ronnie’s songs in there as we can. There are no drum solos and there are no long guitar solos, because we feel that this whole project is about Ronnie, so we just stick to his songs. So it should be a good thing, you know? It’s a celebration to keep the songs alive.
By the way, are you still currently doing things with Rhino Bucket?
I do things on and off. If they get stuck for a drummer, I’ll go in there. We’re really good friends, we’re good mates, so we’re always in touch with one another, especially me and George [Dolivo], the singer, because he’s a crazy Manchester United fan like me…if something comes down and they need my help, or I’ve got something going on and need their help, then it works.
Any other messages to your fans and the other Dio disciples out there around the world?
Come check out Dio Disciples. So far the audiences seem to like what we’re doing, and it’s just total respect for Ronnie and it’s a total celebration of his music. We’re not trying to fool anybody here, so come and check it out.

- Personal Thoughts:
- Another costume filled with firsts. First pleather jacket, first time making functional pockets with zippers and hidden inside the lining no less. It just feels so good!! The costume wasn't extremely hard but working around the zipper definitely proved to be the most challenging aspect.

Oh great, another lovely Monday morning and I can't even think of a comic. There are a few ideas going through my mind, but none of these seem to be the ticklish sort of fun I'm looking for. Maybe I need to drink beer or wine in the morning instead of coffee to get me going...

ChiRunning,.
ChiRunning is not only for your running form, but also helps you train your mind to be more quiet, focused and concentrated. By putting your attention on lifting your legs ChiRunning.
Meditation isn't easy but it's a great practice to train your mind. If you've ever tried to meditate you've noticed that your mind wanders all over the place. two minutes at a time. It could be leaning, picking up your feet, your foot-strike or anything. As you attempt to hold the focus, you'll notice how much your mind wanders. If you're focusing on leaning, gently return your mind and your body to the focus of leaning. The key word here is gently. This is part of the practice--don't beat yourself up and say, "I can't do this!" Simply return to the focus and try again.
Eventually your mind will focus and your body will naturally take on the new way of moving without your mind telling it what to do. After training your mind and your body in this way, you'll find you can learn anything more easily.
ChiRunning is good for your running and for your body. The more you practice focusing in this way, the greater chances you'll have of running longer, faster and both your body and spirit to run free.

The objective is to build your endurance so that on race day you can survive the 26.2 miles of the marathon.
Begin by increasing your long run by only one mile each week. Continue to build this way until your long run is up to 12 miles at a slow and even pace. This pace should be one-and-a-half to two minutes a mile slower than your 10K race pace. Finish feeling that even though you're tired, you could have gone further if you had to.
If the foundation of your program is to develop a long run, what should you do during the rest of the week? The best answer to this question is to run only as much as leaves you comfortable.
The main goal is to recover completely so that you are eager to begin the next long run. It is quite adequate to run only three or four days a week. None of your mid-week runs need exceed five miles.
During this first phase of marathon training, if your weekly mileage starts in the range of 10 to 20 miles, and stays in this range as you push the long run up to 12 miles, that will do fine.
If it grows to about 30 miles a week that will be good too, but it should not exceed this figure during the early growth period. Too much or too fast will lead to an injury.
If you have trained only for 10K's you may not have worried about keeping hydrated during your runs. When you're marathon training you must drink regularly, especially since fall marathons involve training through the heat and, in many areas, humidity of summer.
During your marathon there will be water at about three-mile intervals. Learn to drink at least as frequently during training.
It doesn't matter how you manage the logistics, but it must be built into your training plan. Use water fountains, cache water along the route, carry money and stop at soda machines or stores, or make a deal with someone on your route.
(A Maryland club uses the water cooler at a riding stable and donates a case of bathroom tissue to help support the facility.) As a last resort, carry water during your run. You can buy a waistbelt that carries plastic bottles or carry your supply by hand.
It is important to eat plenty of complex carbohydrates during marathon training. Your endurance is only as good as your glycogen supply.
During the adaptation to distance training your body learns to supplement glycogen by burning fats. In spite of this the body can't function on fats alone, and shortly before your glycogen is used up you'll become exhausted.
The only way to avoid this is to load your muscles with glycogen throughout your training. This means eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain cereals.
You can also reduce your rate of glycogen use by slowing your pace. You see, fats are a higher-calorie fuel than glycogen, nine calories per gram compared to four. This means it takes more oxygen to burn fats compared with carbohydrates.
The way to make sure you maximize your oxygen intake is to slow down. If you run too fast you don't have time to breathe enough oxygen to use a high proportion of fats, so your body has to draw on more glycogen to compensate.
For your first marathon train at a slow pace. This will pay handsome dividends in the last few miles of the long runs.
It is easier to train with other runners. For mutual support run with a club or a group of friends. Hold each other back to the target pace. Don't let the weekend run become competitive. For the first-time marathoner, speed kills!
Out and back training on the same route can become boring. Change the route from time to time. Another way to make things more interesting is to run point to point.
You can car pool back in a car parked before the start of the run. In some areas you can run to a pre-arranged spot and ride back in public transportation. Variety can spice up your training.

Nutrition and Health Book Cover Designs
Nutrition and health books are gaining popularity these days. Designing a cover for a book meant to inspire someone to live a healthier life is not an easy task. Below are some good examples of nutrition books with great covers.
Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All – American Meal
Let’s face it: fast food is convenient and tasty. The downside is it can be extremely unhealthy. This book has been meticulously researched, and shows how the fast food industry is transforming our diet, hastening our landscape, and fueling obesity. From the title, a reader can easily discern the intent of this book. Looking closely at the cover, readers see the United States drawn on the box of french fries. The cover is fitting for the title and is a great depiction of what the readers can expect from this book.
Good Calories, Bad Calories
“Good Calories, Bad Calories” is written by scientific journalist Gary Taubes. This book claims that we have been misled to believe that fat is bad for us, carbohydrates are better, and that the real cause for us gaining weight is taking in the wrong types of calories. The front cover depicts bread a carbohydrate and butter a fat. The title is cleverly placed; and instantly depicts “Good Calories” and “Bad Calories”. This minimalistic cover, keeps the focus on the subject matter of the book.
In “Why We Get Fat” Gary Taubes explains some of the reasons we get fat and what we can do to change it. This cover is minimalistic with contrasting colors to focus on the core thesis of the book. The font weight used on the title varies, and starts thin then gets bold on the word “Fat” for emphasis. The cover is simple and straight to the point and fitting for both the title and contents.
Clean: The Revolutionary Program To Restore the Body’s Natural Ability To Heal Itself
We live in a world where almost everything we consume contain toxic chemicals. “Clean” is a book that offers medically proven ways to help our bodies eliminate and neutralize toxins. The cover’s blue and white hues make the cover feel clean and sanitized. The glass of water serves duel purposes as it ads calm to the cover but is also one of the mediums for eliminating toxins from the body.

@ Baron, Good observation, Colin 1 person, the bike 3 people.
I agree with Peter that it was all a bit surreal. I rounded the corner a little while after hit had happened and saw a rider on the floor in the recovery position and assumed it was someone climbing the hill who had a heart attack. After stopping and turning around it took me a while to recognise Baron and Colin despite having ridden behind them all morning.
The injuries could have been so much worse, the response from everyone was great, warning oncoming cars, first aid, getting Colin back on his feet and home again. One of the benefits of riding in a group I suppose, you always have someone watching out for you.
Colin's an experienced rider (bikes and motorbikes), conditions were perfect, and things like this can still happen. With winter on it's way just try and stay safe out there.
I was just behind Colin as he went round a bend, not even 10 sec back. By the time I rounded it he was already lying under the guard-rail, bike a few meters up. It took a second or 2 to actually register what I was seeing - but not wanting to believe. Then I had to sort my own affairs out, brake sharply on the bend and get back to him without becoming a casualty myself.
Anyway, he was more badly winded than anything else when I got to him, a quick check to see there were no other injuries. From what we can work out, as Colin can't remember, is that somehow the back wheel slid, bit, then kicked him over and onto his back onto the road where he then hit the guard rail post, helmet 1st.
Having had time now to think about it, the injuries could have been so much more serious, Colin thank your helmet, mount it on a pedestal, whatever, it saved your bacon today!!!
Thanks to Pat for taking care of Colin & bike... and to the rest of us, no matter how well you think you know a road, it can allways bite.
You were like a spring chicken Clive.
Colin's been checked out and is all OK.
Further to the discussion with Maz re p*******s, he just phoned and had two on the way home. I'me NEVER discussing them again, EVER.
Sorry that I couldn't make it - ended up doing that track try out last last with AC and quick spin with Tailwind mob this morning, now I am truly spent !

As there is a fairly clear pattern emerging I think that I may close the voting at midnight this Sunday 28 April. If you haven't already voted then please do so by then. I will post reminders over the coming week so that nobody feels left out or uncounted.
Next week I will chase up manufacturing options. Manufacturer and price will depend entirely on order numbers. I may have to make a leap of faith and hope that votes will turn into orders. I will post an order page and size chart next week.
Thank you all for your support to date. Thanks again to Michelle, Gus, Gary Mills and everyone involved in the previous logo graphics manipulation for getting us this far.

$A hits one-week low after jobs figures
- From: AAP
- January 17, 2013
THE Australian dollar has fallen to its lowest point in a week on news the national unemployment rate rose to 5.4 per cent in December.
At 1700 AEDT on Thursday, the local unit was trading at 105.10 US cents, down from 105.53 US cents on Wednesday afternoon.
The currency fell as low as 104.94 US cents, its lowest point in a week, during the afternoon session.
Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Joseph Capurso said the Australian dollar moved lower following the release of December employment figures, which showed the unemployment rate rose to 5.4 per cent in December, from 5.3 per cent the previous month.
"It dropped immediately following the data then rebounded, and then continued moving lower," Mr Capurso said.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed total employment fell 5,500 in December.
Mr Capurso said it had also been a weak session for risk assets like the Australian dollar across the globe.
He said the release of Chinese gross domestic product figures on Friday should provide a boost for the Australian dollar.
"I think it will be a better day and that should see us move back towards that 105.50 US cent level," Mr Capurso said.
At 1700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was at 93.23 Japanese yen, up from 93.03 yen on Wednesday, and at 79.12 euro cents, down from 79.41 euro cents.
Meanwhile, Australian bond futures prices have rallied in the wake of the jobs figures and falls on Asian stock markets.
"We started the day off quite strongly and we haven't really looked back from there," RBC capital markets fixed interest strategist Michael Turner said..

-.3 out of 5Â by 4 reviewers.
Rated 4 out of 5Â by Elite Sport Not too bad, not too good For a shoe in the Adizero series, what you expect from it is being very light. You get that. But you also get shoes that are not durable, and don't fit so well. They are nice and tight from the heel until you get to the toe box. Adidas seems to think people have really fat toes, so they always make toe boxes really big. And on top of that, the leather in the toe box stretches quite a bit. But I like how tight the rest of the shoe os, and I like the asymmetrical lacing; it makes shooting feel more raw. The leather version only comes with a comfort insole, and it is nice and soft, without adding too much weight to the cleats. February 20, 2013
Rated 4 out of 5Â by Premier Sport Awesome cleats I bought these cleats for my high school season hoping they would last my career in high school. So far these cleats havn't let me down. i have used them in two state cup games with my travel team and they worked great, i had a better touch and strike on the ball. i would suggest buying half a size to small becouse the toe cap is on the biger size and made of leather so it will stretch to your foot. the only problem with mine is that they didnt come with the comfort insole and i didnt want to pay for shipping back to adidas.

State to Improve Safety on Alaska Highways
(JUNEAU, Alaska) – Governor Sean Parnell, Transportation and Public Facilities (DOT&PF) Commissioner Pat Kemp and Public Safety Commissioner Joe Masters today announced the State will take significant steps to improve Alaska’s highway safety corridors.
There are presently four designated safety corridors in Alaska: Seward Highway, Potter Marsh to Girdwood; Parks Highway, Wasilla to Houston; Sterling Highway, Sterling to Soldotna; and Knik-Goose Bay Road, Palmer-Wasilla Highway to Pt. MacKenzie. Statewide, serious crashes are down 53 percent within these safety corridors through education, enforcement, engineering and emergency services.
“Our mission is to reduce the accident and injury rates to zero,” Governor Parnell said. “This initiative is a step toward making Alaska’s highway system safer.”
The initiative establishes an Intelligent Transportation System which includes a centralized highway safety operations center, integrates real-time speed sensors, weather sensors, message boards and avalanche detection systems, adds call boxes, and improves cell coverage.
Drivers can expect to see safety improvements made along the Seward Highway this summer. Five additional slow-vehicle turnouts will be constructed at Mileposts 75, 76, 108, 111 and 115. Modification and guardrail work at Milepost 88, which is a high accident location two miles south of Girdwood, is also scheduled for this summer.
The Department of Public Safety will procure two 3-D laser measuring and mapping instruments to reduce highway closure times during accident investigations.
The State of Alaska will receive approximately $150 million in federal highway funds over three years specifically designated for safety improvements.
“Safety has been and will continue to be a primary objective for the Department of Transportation,” said Commissioner Kemp. “This is another intermediate step in safety as we incrementally build new projects to mitigate dangerous areas.”
An audio link providing more details on the initiative is available at:
The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities oversees 255 airports, 11 ferries serving 35 communities, 5,619 miles of highway and 720 public facilities throughout the state of Alaska. The mission of the department is to Get Alaska Movingthrough service and infrastructure.

Communication is the gateway to a successful adoption experience. We want you to know your options within an adoption plan.

Payroll professionals faced with the headaches of administering third-party payments have the option of using an electronic program that simplifies the process and is now available in most Canadian jurisdictions. The program, called the Third Party Remittance Program, is a service created by ADP Canada, a provider of integrated business solutions including traditional and web-based services for payroll and human resources. The electronic program was initially introduced on a limited basis nearly 10 years ago in response to a growing realization of the burden of multiple third party remittances, said Janice MacLellan, ADP’s director of industry relations.
Third party payments
take a lot of effort and paperwork-
Each third-party remittance, such
as garnished child support payments,
RRSP deductions and insurance payments,
requires a significant amount
of effort and paperwork from payroll.
Certain remittances require multiple
forms to be filled out and once that is
done, a cheque must be requisitioned
from a company’s finance department,
creating a package of paperwork and
several carriers for every employee’s
paycheque that has this type of deduction.
The Third Party Remittance
Program streamlined this process,
enabling information on remittances
to be input electronically for each
employee. Once the information was
input for each employee, all remittances
were automatically deducted
and transferred to the appropriate
party each payday. Electronic records
of the transactions were readily available
for review and the paperwork
and time spent on them by payroll
could be significantly reduced.
First banks and insurance companies
then family support agencies -
When ADP Canada developed its
electronic business data transfer solution,
it approached other partners and
the Bank of Canada signed on for
Canada Savings Bond deductions.
Other early partners included the
Royal Bank of Canada, Standard Life,
and the Ontario Family Support
Office. When the latter signed on, the
program began to be used more for
garnishment-types of remittances in
addition to voluntary deductions.
MacLellan said other provincial
family support agencies began
more became technically able to
handle the electronic remittance
program. Recently, New Brunswick’s
Family Support Orders Service signed
on, meaning family support payments
can be made and reported on electronically
in most Canadian jurisdictions
except Yukon and Nunavut.
Advantages for all parties -
The system benefits employers,
employees and the beneficiaries of the
remittances, said MacLellan. Companies
and governments are becoming
more environmentally conscious and
electronic remittance of third party
payments falls into line with paperwork
reduction initiatives that many
governments are working on.
“Governments are implementing
online reporting and payment solutions,”
said MacLellan. “It’s a good fit
for government agencies and aligns
with their strategic plans to reduce
paperwork.”
In addition to reducing administration
work for payroll, electronic third
party remittance also enables a faster
timeline for payments. RRSP payments
are invested faster and interest
costs and late payment penalties for
garnishments can be reduced. But
perhaps most importantly, said
MacLellan, social support payments
can get to the recipients faster.
“There’s a positive social impact
for beneficiaries of family support
payments,” said MacLellan. “Kids
don’t get support payments until
agencies receive funds. With electronic
remittance, there’s a quicker
turnaround and the money is sent
more quickly.”
Another consideration is that benefits
and conveniences such as group
insurance are becoming more
popular for employers to offer, which
adds the potential for even more
deductions that will have to be made
from employee paycheques and more
payments to be sent to a variety of
recipients. Utilizing an electronic
process for the increasing number of
third-party remittances would save
payroll a lot of headaches, MacLellan
said.
“We’re hoping to support a trend
for employers to automate, reduce
tasks and improve efficiency,” said
MacLellan. “We want to reduce the
number of manual handoffs and take
advantage of the technology available.”

Plastic Recycling Process. You can:
- 1st option :
Choose from our extensive range of existing profiles; or
- 2nd option :.
The process
The process of creating our wood plastic composite products from household, commercial and industrial post consumer waste is as follows:
We gather post industrial waste, post consumer polyolefin plastics and process them into pellets.
The pellets are converted to resin, which is then compounded with 100% recycled waste wood.
The compounded material is then continuously extruded through a die-cut profile into almost any required shape and form factor.
The material, now wood plastic composite, is cooled with water – which is continuously reused.
The finished product is automatically machine cut to length up to 6m and above by request.
The resulting product is strong, attractive, versatile, resistant to pests and corrosion and, of course, good for the environment.
The key points in our processes:
- Efficient
- Effective
- OHS compliant
- Fully recycled water
- Continuous extrusion
- Fully automated process
- Automated cutting

What Keeps CIOs Awake At Night
Cloud computing challenges, compliance headaches and retaining fickle young talent in a world of shrinking bonuses were some of the topics discussed at yesterday's MarketTech 2012. Sponsored by Tabb Group, a bevy of capital markets technologists from sell-side and buy-side firms shared their thoughts -- and fears -- about what needs to be done in the arena of financial IT. The following is a sample of the quotes that caught our attention.
1. Dust Off Those Cobol Skills
With the financial services industry spending 73% of IT funds on maintenance, why would an up and coming developer come to financial services? How can that compare to building the next iPhone?
— Steven J. Sadoff, executive vice president, global head of operations, services & technology, Knight Equity Markets, on the challenge of retaining young IT talent.

Green screen problem: "You spend more time lighting a screen that won't exist than lighting the people that do!" - Dariusz Wolski
About Me & AdvanceHDTV
how did i get here?
Well... The road has been long, with many, many projects and many, many people. And I would be remiss if I didn't say: very interesting! I've been able to meet such a wide range of people from heads of state to actors and musicians to people who 'make the news' - and that can vary from the criminal to the victim to heads of state and actors 'n' musicians 'n' blah blah blah!
To say 'I've done it all' feels right even though it is far from the truth. It would probably be easier for me to tell you about what I haven't done or been involved in than it would be to tell what I've done. Of course I'm speaking generally from a film and video perspective.
Yes, I've worked on feature films, commercials, music videos, corporate video, news, live TV, sports, Olympics, web video. I've worked on Broadway productions, my commercials air all over North America on a regular basis, got to meet some amazing people over the years. I worked in News, then Corporate video, then went on my own where I did all of the above and more.
I am a Producer, DOP, videographer/cinematographer, an editor, a sound mixer/recordist, musician and audio editor, a graphics artist (okay I do some stuff in PhotoShop and Illustrator... maybe not really an 'artist' as it were...), a writer, director. I'm a lighting designer, a compositor, a grip and a props manager, line producer, production manager and lest we forget, an accountant, janitor and chief bottle washer.
I am a Jack of All, but I've also had to be a Master of All. Okay, maybe Master is a strong word but suffice to say that I had to be very good at all of it. I had to do all of it so good that no one would be wiser. Am I rich? Ha! Far from it. I make a decent living, pay the bills and am still raising a family. I also still create video.
I love it and hate it at the same time. I'm jaded yet love the new directions and trends. I love new gear and how it works (or the promise of how it should work... more on that later). I love how some refer to their setup and equipment as the 'only' way, when in fact there are so many ways it'll make your head spin. Let's step back for a minute... I got into this game when there was one format/standard. It was easy, everyone knew what to do and how it worked. You had one standard to worry about. Even shooting and editing were straight up (in terms of the basics). Now though, we've got so many different formats and codecs and distribution methods from web video to DVD and Blu-Ray to good old fashioned broadcast TV.
This is one of the many reasons I started this blog. I want to be able to help others understand and achieve their goals in this murky, muddy universe. From what gear I like to use and how it gets used. Where you can find some 'secret' or maybe not so secret places on the web that'll help you deliver an outstanding product. So that's me in a nut-shell. Check out my gear page as well you'll find some cool (or at least useful) stuff there.
Onward!
Some fun facts about me and my career (ok I think they're fun!)
- Played guitar live on stage with Jerry Doucette doing his big hit Mama Let Him Play
- My duo played in a wrap party that was attended by Bradley Whitford and Neve Campbell, and they both really enjoyed us
- Interviewed a relatively unknown singer by the name of Celine Dion
- Interviewed Billy Ray Cyrus when he was at the top of his game
- Worked with Captain Kirk aka William Shatner
- Worked with Jason Bonham, the son of legendary drummer John Bonham
- Met Sid Bernstein, the man responsible for bringing the Beatles to the US in 1964
- Attended a taping of Friends where I drooled on Jennifer Aniston (well, not really on her, but about 5 feet away... at least she smiled at me!)

In the car with Gray.
I saw a bird! Mommy I saw a bird I saw a bird a bird! a bird!
You did? What do you think its name is?
BIRDS DON'T HAVE NAMES.
Then what do they call each other?
They don't talk. They are birds.
But what about all those tweet tweets we hear? Isn't that how they communicate? In their birdy language?
ELEPHANTS MOONICAKE. With their trunks.
But they don't have names either. They are elephants, Mom.
Twitter me- I'm babysteph
Safari Planet with Brian Fellows ;)
Too cute!
'Moonicake' just may be my new favourite word. Awesome, and sweet as can be!

--Sara Sophia

Love this!
You don't even post pictures and they are so cute - he has definitely coined a new word there!!! Hope you all have a fabulous weekend!!!
so funny! i love that age :)
There are some pronouciations that are too cute to correct.
Like our caweem cheese eating.
J is just now getting to the age where he says at least three priceless things a day. So far, today's standout was at lunch (I ordered delivery, yikes!) and he was requesting that I make him scrambled eggs instead:
"C'mon, mama! You be the guy who cooks and I'll be the guy who eats!"
I was slayed.
And I made the eggs ;)
It's hard to argue with that isn't it?
Moonicake. ROTFL Fab-o. Thanks for that!
I'm going to start telling my husband he has to MOONICAKE himself more clearly :)
I love kidspeak, LOL!
I'm going to start saying "moonicake" from now on. Too cute! I still use all those quirky little names that my kids made up for stuff. ;)
I love conversations with little ones! I wish I had a recording all the time, as I always seem to miss the good stuff!
Love this.

Ohh, her camera straps are darling! So fresh and feminine, I love them! The chocolate truffle caught my eye, and so did the mint julep. I love them all!
I like the Sweet Cherry Pie apron. It looks like it could make housework fun!
Lovely is exactly the right word for these. Her aprons made my day.
Gorgeous! I love the Pink Lady - Ruffle camera strap!

I LOVE the poppy apron, because I don't have a dslr camera... They are gorgeous, though!!

I like "paint the town red"
I love the Sweet Cherry Pie ruffled half apron too. I would feel like a queen cooking with that apron ;)
Her work is amazing! It is really hard to pick a favorite... but if I had to it would be some cherry pie. Life would just be better with some cherry pie in it :)

I went to her shop and this captured my attention.
Nell

I love the camera straps, especially the paint the town red and gobstopper choices. Too cute!
I love the Poppy Seed apron, I would love to win this for Erica my lovely roommate from Evo. I don't have a dslr but she does and was talking about how she wanted a fun camera strap.
These camera straps are awesome! We purchased a new dslr camera before the holidays and it was supposed to me mine, but my husband has taken it over. I think one of these straps would help me reclaim it! The Lemon Drop would be great because the colors are still neutral.
I like the french roast ruffled camera strap cover! Everyting is PRECIOUS!
isn't she great? i love her straps.
Oh, I love them all! I've been eyeing fancy camera straps for a long time but I haven't found the money to splurge on myself just yet. The lemon drop is my favorite followed by seabreeze and orange blossom. Too beautiful.
Oh I love the Poppy Seed - Ruffled Half-Apron, but I could I wear it as a skirt? So cute!
The poppy seed apron is darling. She sells gorgeous things! Bookmarking her!
Oh, I love everything, she is amazing! And so are you, thank you! (If I have to pick one, then it'll be the Watermelon Sorbet Ruffled Camera Strap Cover)
The sweet cherry pie apron is to die for! I'm also loving the idea of jazzing up my camera strap. Maybe it will give me the books to make my pictures look better!
I love the Watermelon Sorbet camera strap- so fun and fresh for the summer!!
Love the colors in the lemon drop...but if I had to pick a different one, it would be the Mint Julep.
The I (heart) cupcakes apron needs to be mice.

I love the poppyseed apron. I have an etsy mei tai in the middle floral fabric.
Bri
Ohhh I am in LOVE with that Chocolate truffle! But really, you can't go wrong, they are all adorable.
Loving the Sweet Cherry Pie - Ruffled Half-Apron. I love the camera strap covers but I have lost my camera strap so it is hard to love a cover without a strap to put it on. I would sooo find one if I won though.
I LOVE the French Roast strap... WOW!
I LOVE the French Roast strap... WOW!
I was JUST looking on Etsy for cute camera straps! I'm so glad you featured your beautiful strap and where I can get one. And by the way, that picture is truly one of my favorites....although I know I've said that a lot.
I just wanted to say hi. Happy summer to you and yours, my friend.
Oh Oh!! I LOVE all of her camera straps. My favorites are the Lemon Drop and Watermelon Sorbet. I am a photographer, and I am always looking for cute straps. I think these are some of the cutest I have ever found! Thanks for posting this!
So very nice of you, blue and yellow are my favorite color combos....I'll keep my fingers crossed. I love the poppy ruffled apron as well, ahh...to have that talent!
:)
That is so hard! Maybe the Lemon Drop. Or the Truffle. Or even the French Roast. Cute, cute, cute.
Love the watermelon sorbet strap! :) Awesome! That blue/yellow one is so cute too!
I love a ruffled tote bag she had on there a couple of weeks ago. All of her stuff is so sweet!
~Jenny
I just love her Cue The Music Half Apron! The colors are gorgeous!
ooohhhh so pretty! I love the Seabreeze - Ruffled, dSLR Camera Strap Cover...I'm a sucker for anything turquoise! But I gotta say I think I love the lemon drop one maybe just a teensy bit better!
I automatically went for the french roast camera strap- but then decided to go out of my comfort level, cause the whole ruffle thing is way out of it anyway, so think the chocolate truffle would be fun.
Love the chocolate truffle camera strap. LOVE LOVE LOVE.
Those ruffled camera straps are adorable! I really like the Lemon Drop one and the French Roast one! :)
the sweet cherry pie apron is really cute! Thanks!
Very pretty! I like the Gobstopper and Orange Blossom styles.
I LOVE the 'Mint Julep', however I would actually need to get a dSLR camera first.
Oh, and seeing as how I'm a horrific cook, and avoid the kitchen whenever possible, I probably won't be needing an apron any time soon ;) Do people really wear aprons?!?!
Lisa,
I wear an apron!!! :) I have a few, but you can see my favorite one here.
Steph
I have tried twice to post a comment and it doesn't seem to be working so I apologize If a few duplicates pop up in an hour. I honestly love the lemon drop strap. So fun and pretty. If I buy one for myself I'll have to add the lens cap pocket, I am constantly losing that thing!
Would be super cute to tote around at BlogHer... but I'd use it on my video camera, not photo camera ;)
definitely the Poppy Seed Ruffled Half-Apron. fav-o-rite. the camera strap is super adorbs too.
Such great camera straps! The French Roast is one of my favs :)
i love ruffles. and polka dots. and my camera. <3
I do so love that camera strap and would hold on to it in hopes of soon getting a camera fit to wear it. But if I had to say something else... that cupcake apron is adorable and would be so fun to bake in!
love all the aprons! I also love this camera strap... def my favorite of all!
I love the lemon drop camera strap. I know the perfect friend who would love it...
Love love the sweet cherry pie ruffled apron! Would probably get the most use from the camera strap- how lovely!
Hey, now you're just like Oprah giving away your favorite things!
LOVE the chocolate truffle camera strap!
I love the Sweet Cherry Pie apron. :) It's beautiful.
I'd have a hard time choosing between the Lemon Drop camera strap, and the Watermelon Sorbet camera strap... LOVE.
LOve them all but I would have to say french roast is my favorite!
I like the chocolate truffle!!
Ooh la la -- I love the French Roast strap cover. What a pretty little thing!
Best of luck to everyone!
And thanks, Steph, for this chance to win! <3
These are lovely! I love the French Toast and Chocolate Truffle camera straps!
I love French Roast, but I might have to go with Rustic Charm (for the hubs)if I were to buy one!
I have a Nikon D90 and I'd love to cover the strap w/ this pretty pop of lemon color.
I also like the Poppy Seed apron (cheery!) and the Pink Lady camera strap (girly!).

And every time I order Tiny Prints I always use the live chat feature- I ask lots of questions- even silly stuff like, I like this card but I want it for a horizontal photo, what do you suggest... etc, and I have gotten immediate assistance every single time.
Lulu says "that's me!"

Oh, I would totally get a Christmas Card for our family - my new DSLR just arrived on Tuesday, so I'm super excited about this year's picture!
I LOVE your card. I love holiday cards...seems like a lot of people don't send them anymore, but I always do. I like receiving them and watching my little card holder fill up too!
I follow you on twitter, I'm @posielove
And I follow you on Twitter. When I get on :)
Last year - for the first time, I was too overwhelmed to do Christmas cards. And I would like to do them again this year....would totally use this for Christmas cards.
I follow you through my google reader. And email. Which is probably redundant, but oh well... ;)
Oh gosh, I love Tiny Prints. Since I'm a design student I am constantly drooling over their cards. I'd love to win so I can drool over them in person. :) I love that DwellStudio has partnered with TinyPrints, too. :)
Your Christmas card is beautiful Steph! I would love to get Christmas photo cards this year. Last year we did a newsletter through Publisher and just sent them out through email to save money.
Holiday Cards...any one of about 37 designs that I love. Love love love.
I was so happy to help you out. I just loved that photo so much! Not as much as I love you, though.
I love all of the folded holiday photo cards. I can't decide which to use but I would probably swoon if I won a gift certificate.
I just ordered my birth announcements from them! I can't wait to order our christmas cards from them. They have so many cute ones that I can't decide which one I would choose.
I would love Xmas cards!
I follow you on twitter!

Your card's are beautiful - I'll take 50 (though I suppose it would seem funny to send out cards with someone elses' picture on them.)
Or maybe baby announcements this spring?
No, definitely Christmas cards. The Be Blessed is beautiful but I suppose it would depend on what photo I chose first...
jennifer @ beautifulcalling.ca
I chose that exact card last year! Loved it!
i'd order more Christmas cards with that $50!

I love your family photo. :) This post has been a great reminder for me to get started on my Christmas cards and I just sent an e-mail to my favorite photographer to schedule our photo shoot.

Baby announcement all the way!
I was SO overwhelmed with a colic baby the 1st time that announcements never even entered my mind.
Because I could hear her.
Quite.
Clearly.
Then a seizure for her on day 5.
Here's to hoping there's less drama with baby #2!
(And some serious coffee/wine reserves!)
I would get holiday cards made. The only problem would be picking which design!

I would love a Tiny Prints gift certificate! We just made a huge move and it would be great to send out Christmas/Change of Address cards (something, that with such a major life change, we won't be able to afford this year!)
Thank you!
I already got my Christmas card so I would probably make little Valentines in February. :) I love Tiny Prints!
I love what you chose, Steph! Your photos are gorgeous. And I love carefully writing out each address with a fine tip Sharpie too!
I've never ordered from Tiny Prints, but I do love their cards. I think I'd choose Christmas cards. Or maybe announcements . . . you know, for sometime in the future ;)

It turned out perfect! Love it. I've used them for birth announcements but never for Christmas. I need to check them out.
So far Tiny Prints is the only place I have found that has a card in the style I want. See, I want a card with 8 photos on it, in the style of the Brady Bunch, because we have six kids--three boys and three girls and it would just be so cute. But I can't afford to buy them because of how many we send out. So I really hope I win.
Love your cards.
too cute!
I'd definitely go for Christmas cards. Maybe the blessed on (haven't picked a picture yet).

I keep creating and saving different designs for my Christmas cards. How would I ever choose which ones to actually get if I win?
You have amazing taste.... that is the same style I used last year. Loved it! Hoping to get a good picture for this year over the weekend so I can make this year's cards using Tiny Prints again.
How does one choose?!? I love the checkerboard chic Christmas card. I'm always looking for a card where I can use multiple photos, since it's so rare to get one that showcases all 6 of us well.
Whether I win or not, that site is bookmarked for shopping. (I wish my Christmas cards were ready. That's a great tradition you have there.)
I also follow you on Twitter. :-)

i never do christmas cards because i am too disorganized. it's kind of sad. your cards are beautiful. and i love that you call ivy lulu. my mom used to call me that. and lee-lee.

Oh boy, lots of comments here already, but why not give it a shot!
I spent some time today on the Tiny Print web site (before reading this) and wished I could justify spending over a $1 a card. Such beautiful things!
I settled on their Joy card in black because it is exactly what I intend to feel this holiday season. No stress, just joy. Of course, winning this little contest might add to that joy a little ;)
I just love Christmas card time. It makes my heart happy to send them and receive them.
And sharpies? Well, don't tell anyone, but they are my secret addiction. When school sales happen, I buy buckets of them. All different colors, I'm not biased. :)

A Tale of Two BRICs — India Surges While China Struggles

Growing Pains in the BRICs
Tuesday, September 25th, 2012
September 2012
by Neuberger Berman Investment Strategy Group
The “BRIC” countries have been a focal point of investor interest since the early 2000s. Brazil, Russia, India and China account for about half of the world’s population, boast vast natural resources and are among the fastest-growing economies in the world. That said, progress at times has been uneven. Since 2010, the MSCI BRIC Index has largely underperformed the S&P 500 as economic growth flagged. In this edition of Strategic Spotlight, we discuss current conditions and the outlook for these markets.
Separate Paths
Following the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the BRIC countries enjoyed a strong economic rebound as forceful policy measures reignited growth. However, a surge in capital inflows stoked inflation and led to tightening measures in 2010 and 2011. Currently, the BRICs are experiencing varying stages of easing as growth and inflation decline. Unlike the synchronous rebound we saw in 2009, progress in the BRIC countries is diverging due in part to idiosyncratic policy initiatives aimed at managing structural changes within their specific economies.
BRIC GROWTH RATES HAVE SLOWED
Source: FactSet
Brazil: Reaccelerating?
Brazil’s real GDP growth declined from 9.3% in the first quarter of 2010 to 0.5% in the second quarter of 2012—a number that disappointed investors looking for 3.5% GDP growth for all of 2012. The slowdown is partly a function of so-called macro-prudential measures—meant to fight inflation and control the appreciation of the real currency due to capital inflows—as well as a slowdown in exports. The tightening measures have had the desired impact of reducing inflation from 7.2% from last September to 4.1% in August 2012, but have also caused investment spending to plummet as the outlook for commodities (a key sector for Brazil) deteriorated. Domestic consumption, which accounts for about 60% of Brazilian GDP, has held up surprisingly well, supported by the country’s still-low unemployment rate.
Since the end of 2011, the Brazilian central bank has reduced interest rates, complementing the government’s recent accommodative fiscal measures such as payroll tax cuts. The OECD expects growth to pick up gradually in the third quarter as these measures work through the system.
Russia: The Limitations of Oil
The Russian economy has held up reasonably well in the past few years despite turmoil in Europe. Since the end of June 2012, real GDP has grown at around 4% annually, which is close to the post-crisis peak of around 5% in 2010. This good fortune is mainly due to relatively high oil prices and, most recently, fiscal spending ahead of the presidential elections in March 2012. Unlike Brazil, Russia is grappling with rising inflation as record-low unemployment has supported wage growth. In September, the country’s central bank surprised investors by hiking interest rates as inflation had come in above the bank’s target range of 5%–6%.
For the most part, Russia’s domestic consumption has been strong but the impact of declining oil demands from key trading partners such as Europe and China could have spillover effects—weakening the outlook for budget and current account balances. Concerns about an overheating economy have led to predictions that further tightening measures could be introduced, marginally reducing growth in 2013.
PERFORMANCE AND VALUATIONS
Source: FactSet as of Sept 17, 2012.
India 2.0
Despite a year-to-date equity market return of about 20% (see display), India’s real GDP growth continuously slowed to about 4% in the second quarter—a level last seen during the crisis of 2008–2009. Declining global growth, reductions in foreign investments and monetary tightening measures have contributed to a slowdown in manufacturing and services. In June, government agencies reported that foreign direct investments had decreased by as much as 67% from a year ago, as economic reforms stalled and business conditions were increasingly viewed as being biased against foreigners.
In addition, India is dealing with rising consumer price inflation, as recent cuts in government fuel subsidies and the effects of the monsoon season feed through the system. Consumer price inflation ramped up to 10% in August, reducing the scope for further rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India. Moreover, warnings of a downgrade have been issued by rating agencies, given that India’s government finances are weaker than other BRIC countries. Investors are closely watching reform measures designed to promote competition and improve market efficiency following the decision last week to expand foreign companies’ access to the retail and airline industries.
China: Political Transitions
Recent data indicate that China continues to slow from tightening measures enacted in 2010–2011 and a decline in exports. Investors have been somewhat surprised by the government’s passivity toward this slowdown. Following small cuts in interest rates and reserve requirement ratios earlier in the year, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has not done more despite inflation dipping below its 3%–4% target. And while most analysts did not expect a repeat of the 2008–2009 RMB 4.0T fiscal stimulus, the government has acted less forcefully than expected.
The failure to act could be a result of widely reported complications in the current once-in-a-decade change to the country’s political leadership. Moreover, the PBoC could be concerned about magnifying the inflationary impact of loose monetary policy in developed countries. The political transition is expected to conclude by March 2013, potentially paving the way for better policy engagement. Regardless, the IMF expects China’s growth to reaccelerate next year.
A More Nuanced Progression
In the past decade, the BRIC countries have experienced rapid growth, but are now showing signs of slowing down as cheap labor and abundant resources are beginning to yield a diminishing impact on their economies. As such, investors should consider looking towards the rising middle class to lead the charge in driving growth.
Before we reach that point, however, we believe some structural reforms will need to be made. Investors should remain vigilant of the various policy prescriptions during this period to avoid potential speed bumps. Not every policy change will be successful, but if imbalances are adequately addressed, the BRIC countries should continue to offer investment opportunity.

Emerging Markets Radar (September 24, 2012)
Monday, September 24th, 2012
Emerging Markets Radar (September 24, 2012)
Strengths
- China needs more subways, highways and sewage plants, and construction of those infrastructures will help the economy, Xu Lin, the head of the planning department at National Development and Reform Commission said this week.
- Malaysia’s CPI stayed flat at 1.4 percent in August as in July.
- The Federation of Thai Industries reported solid August auto production of 210,333 units (up 37 percent year-over-year), driven by strong domestic sales.
Weaknesses
- HSBC September Flash China PMI was 47.8 versus estimate 47.6 for August, which, though improved on a month-over-month basis, indicates that the economic activities still are contracting. However, new orders overall increased to 47.6 from 46.1.
- Taiwan August export orders fell 1.5 percent year-over-year, improving from the contraction of 4.4 percent in July. The market expects export orders in tech products to revive going forward due to iPhone 5 and Windows 8 ODM plays.
- Turkey GDP growth, which was 8.5 percent in 2011 and 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 2012, slowed down to 2.9 in the second quarter.
Opportunities
- Foreign investors have consistently put more money in Asia equity markets, such as the Philippines as shown in the graph above. Particularly, Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries are on the rise in consumer spending and infrastructure investments helped by an increasing middle class and growing government balance sheet.
- India opened retail and aviation sectors for foreign investment, cut the fuel subsidy by 12 percent and cut the withholding tax on local corporate bonds held by foreigners 20 percent to 5 percent.
- In a separate move, India’s central bank cut its reserve ratio requirement for the banks by 25 basis points, setting the stage for a rally in financials.
Threats
- The tension between Japan and China over disputed islands in East China and North Taiwan is escalating with some possibility of trade and military clashes.
- Credit Suisse remains cautious on the Polish banking sector, and cut 2012 earnings forecast by 13 percent due to cyclical pressures from lower loan growth and higher provisioning charges.
- President Putin was critical of the proposed budget for not incorporating provisions for several of his election promises. This higher expenditure will have to be financed through borrowing and/or higher taxes.

Could Earnings Growth Go Negative This Quarter?
Tuesday, September 18th, 2012
The last two quarters we have seen quite a deceleration in S&P 500 earnings – in fact the S&P 499 has been flatlining. But Apple has a massive out sized effect on earnings (and hence supporting S&P 500 earnings growth). The NYT has a piece out this morning where they extrapolate a potential negative growth rate on said earnings, even with Apple. With export revenues hurt by Europe and to a lesser degree “emerging markets” (China, India, Brazil, et al) and profit margins falling from record highs, this is definitely an issue. That said stock prices are part earnings and part multiples – multiples are always an unknown; we saw how high they could get in 1999 when Uncle Alan flooded the world with liquidity ahead of Y2K.

Gold Gains on Poor Jobs Report, QE Hopes, and Declining USD
Saturday, September 8th, 2012
Gold Market Radar (September 10, 2012)
For the week, spot gold closed at $1735.65, up $43.64 per ounce, or 2.58 percent. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, rose 5.16 percent. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar Index lost 1.29 percent for the week.
Strengths
- Gold surged on Friday to close at $1,735.65—up 2.58 percent for the week—primarily on the heels of a poor jobs report and the accompanying expectation of quantitative easing and the debasement of the U.S. dollar. Technically, gold extended its recent rally above the 200-day moving average, and is now within striking distance of its February highs. The dollar, on the other hand, plummeted below its 200-day moving average on Friday. If the price action is allowed to speak for itself, the question is not whether there will be QE, but when.
- Significantly, a number of analysts raised their year-end forecasts for gold prices. A quick survey: J.P.MorganChase called for gold to close the year at $1,800; Goldman Sachs said $1,840; Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggested $2,000 in the event of QE, and one Citigroup analyst called for gold to reach $2,500 by the end of the first quarter 2013, and even higher in the event of geopolitical conflict.
- The fall seasonality trade looks to be in full swing. This historically strong period of the year for gold prices is supported by a weakening dollar, a strengthening euro, and seasonally strong demand.
Weaknesses
- AuRico Gold decreased its production guidance substantially at its Ocampo project: 2012 guidance was essentially halved, 2013 guidance cut by 25 percent, and the stock finished down for the holiday-shortened week, off about 14 percent.
- Continued strikes in South Africa are problematic. While the unions were said to be close to a deal this week, sending troubled Lonmin up midweek, the deals fell through, and strikes are ongoing with very few workers returning to work.
Opportunities
- Global accommodative monetary policies remain very much in play. The Fed meeting next week—on the heels of a poor jobs report—offers the possibility for further easing and may be an additional catalyst for gold prices.
- Gold, as priced in euros, is rapidly approaching its all-time highs.
- We mentioned last week that the dollar’s 200-day moving average might be defended from a technical standpoint. A decisive break below that average, as occurred on Friday, likely signals further weakness in the dollar to come and possible gains in gold.
Threats
- India—the world’s largest importer of gold—may raise the import duty on gold for the third time this year, potentially curtailing some Indian demand. Bloomberg reported that, “The government may look at increasing the duty to 7.5 percent,” according to the president of the Bombay Bullion Association. The time frame on this potential policy change remains unclear at this point.
- There remains the risk that an inflation premium is cooked into the gold price, which, in the event of no quantitative easing, would cause prices to react negatively. The Fed’s next meeting is September 12-13.
- A rapid move upward in gold and gold equities which does not successfully trigger meaningful short-covering might invite resistance, or additional short positions. The ultimate identifiable catalyst for short-covering remains government policy a la quantitative easing in the near term.

After a long four-year wait, trading of call and put options on the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) has finally come to pass. The regulatory hurdles faced by both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been resolved.
Since gold is regulated by the CFTC whereas securities are regulated by the SEC, GLD's hybrid nature complicated matters, which slowed the process of listing options. Even though the trust's gold is held in a secured vault in the form of London Good Delivery Bars, GLD is still governed under the Securities Act of 1933.
Judging by the initial volume, trading in GLD options has been brisk. Call options with a strike price of $90 for the September expiration already had over 6,000 outstanding option contracts.

As the end of the year approaches, pretty much every advisor out there is starting to worry about those dreaded annual client reviews. During a financial year that is being referred to as the worst since the Great Depression, one can only imagine how horrified clients will be when they realize just how much longer they'll have to keep digging ditches and frying fries.
It's in years like this one that financial advisors earn their money and their grand award trips. If you can hang on to your clients through this mess, you can rest assured that they are yours for life. With that being said, what exactly can you say to ease your clients' pain?
When the going gets rough, I always find it helpful to blame someone or something. One suggestion you may want to consider is to blame George Bush. With a presidential approval rating of -32 percent, he is as good a target as any. While you're throwing Mr. President under the bus, try to work in the phrases The Iraq War, Osama Bin Laden and Dick Cheney as often as you can. My guess is many of your clients will agree with your assessment.
If blaming the commander-in-chief doesn't work, try blaming all those formerly ultra-rich Wall Street executives and hedge fund managers for manipulating the markets into oblivion. And for those New Age clients in your book, my suggestion is to simply say, "This has been a bad karma year." (Then bow your head and meditate: "Oooohhhmmmmmmm.")
If you're uncomfortable with the blame game, another tack you might take is to try to convince your clients that this disastrous year has actually been a good thing. Remind them that when the share price of their mutual fund goes down, their re-invested dividends are actually buying them more shares! Some clients will understand this concept, while others will reach across your desk and slap you.
Overwhelming clients with statistics is another tactic that can help prove to them that this year has been a blessing in disguise. You can tell them that -- in addition to all the food stamps and government cheese they are able to get -- there's a good chance the stock market will be up substantially in 2009. Inform them that, in years when the market has had a major decline, the stock market has rebounded the following year. You might even try the old line, "Now is a great time to buy; the stock market is having a major sale!" For safety's sake, step back out of arms' reach when you say this.
You may also tell your clients that they are being tested right now. Years ago, when they still had money, you both came up with a rock-solid investment strategy. You both knew there would be up markets and there would be down markets. This just happens to be one of those down markets. Try saying something like, "In times like these, our strategies are tested. Do you want to cut and run now, or do you want to pass the test?" This might convince them to hang tough -- after all, who the heck wants to flunk a test (besides my kid)?
If none of the above seems to be right for you, go with the ambiguous. Say something along the lines of, "The market didn't perform as well as we had hoped this year." Or, "We had a few hiccups in our economy that no one saw coming." Or, simply say anything with "subprime" in it at least three times.
Will any of these techniques actually make your clients feel better about this year of economic Armageddon? Probably not. But if you have to go down, you might as well go down swinging.

American women may think they’re good at penny-pinching, but it turns out that they’ll need to save even more if they want to feel secure in retirement.
Women, especially widows and those age 80 and over, depend on Social Security benefits more than men, the latest U.S. government study on women in retirement shows, but they’re also doing a better job of contributing to their employer-sponsored retirement plans.
In 2010, 16% of women age 65 and over depended solely on Social Security for income compared with 12% of men, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s July 25 report to the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging. At the same time, the share of household income women received from earnings increased over the period, but it was consistently lower than for men.
Worse, women’s median income was approximately 25% lower than men’s over the last decade, and the poverty rate for women in this age group was nearly two times higher than men’s in 2010.
“Moreover, divorce and widowhood had more pronounced effects for women than for men,” the GAO reported. “For example, women’s household income, on average, fell by 41% with divorce, almost twice the size of the decline that men experienced. For widowhood, women’s household income fell by 37% — while men’s declined by only 22%.”
A Bright Spot: 401(k)s
But a bright spot in the report is the finding that working women’s participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans such as 401(k)s has improved relative to men.
“Indeed, from 1998 to 2009, women surpassed men in their likelihood of working for an employer that offered a pension plan, largely because the proportion of men covered by a plan declined,” the GAO said.
Women’s participation rates in defined-contribution plans increased slightly over that period as men’s participation fell, thus narrowing the participation difference between men and women to just one percentage point. At the same time, however, women contributed to their DC plans at lower levels than men.
“Specifically, the participation rate for women in any type of plan, defined benefit or defined contribution, declined slightly from 87% in 1998 to 86% in 2009, while the participation rate for men declined from 91% to 87%,” according to the full GAO report.
The study’s findings were brought before the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging on July 25, according to Bloomberg. The hearing’s discussion focused on improving the Social Security Administration’s efforts to tell retirees about the advantages of waiting longer before claiming benefits.
“SSA has a responsibility to educate people about their options, and it needs to make sure people understand just how much money they are losing when they take their benefits sooner rather than later,” Bloomberg reported Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., as saying. Kohl led the hearing.
“All of these options have advantages and disadvantages that would need to be evaluated prior to implementation,” the GAO said. “For example, increasing Social Security benefits for widows could provide additional income for women who have few options to increase their retirement savings. However, increasing benefits would also increase costs to the Social Security program and have implications for its long-term solvency.”

Susan Colpitts
When Susan Colpitts co-founded Signature in 1994, there was something missing from the financial services landscape: the multi-family office. So she and her partner created one.
“When we started, they didn’t exist—anywhere,” says Colpitts, a CPA. “It was novel at the time for a firm like ours to be owned by principals as opposed to being owned by a family. And we liked being fireable because it kept us good every day.”
By any measure, Norfolk-based Signature has gone from good to great.
The fee-only firm that started out with three employees and no clients now has 32 employees, offices in three cities, and $2.5 billion in assets under management. Colpitts herself manages $560 million in assets for 18 wealthy families.
Why a multi-family office? Back in the 1990s, Colpitts was working as a CPA inside a boutique law firm run by Signature co-founder Anne Shumadine. The firm served a couple of very wealthy families. The problem: The complexity of managing different aspects of that level of wealth—investments, philanthropy, income taxes and estate planning—couldn’t be addressed within the framework of a law firm.
“Most RIAs start out with investments and add services,” says Colpitts, 55. “We started backwards. We didn’t come at this with a preexisting notion of what investments should look like. We addressed it almost like a research project: If you could build any investment solution, how would you build it?”
The partners settled on an endowment-like model with the additional requirement that it had to be tax-efficient. After the 2001-2002 downturn, they realized they needed to have access to alternative investments so they built a hedge fund solution—pooling clients’ assets to get the best managers at the best price point. In 2008, they made another adjustment by instituting a long-only equity fund.
The business plan from the start was to develop Signature as a one-stop shop for, as Colpitts puts it, “the working rich.” The plan worked. Unlike many family offices, 85% of Signature’s asset base represents first-generation earned wealth. The firm’s minimum for new clients is $5 million in investable assets but Colpitts spends the majority of her time on family-office clients with more than $20 million in investable assets and complex problems. A liquidity event often brings the client to Signature’s door.
“In the last several years, we’ve realized we are really good at working with the individual who has had his head down, building the business day in and day out and running that business,” says Colpitts, who holds the Personal Financial Specialist designation and started her accounting career with Price Waterhouse. “They’re not thinking about wealth. Suddenly, they sell the business and they have incredible opportunities—and a lot of decisions to make. Every client is different in that moment.”
When she begins a conversation with a new family, she starts with a series of questions, including: How do you wish to be involved in philanthropy? How do you replace the paycheck? How do you make sense of the lifestyle? Notably, everyone in the firm trains with a psychologist so that they can help clients express feelings that might otherwise remain unspoken.
“We’re trying to figure out what their investment personality is. They might say: ‘I don’t want to take any risk with my investments.’ If you don’t know how to open that up, it could be a door-shutting comment,” says Colpitts, whose firm also has offices in Charlottesville and Richmond.
“We want to get at the root cause without putting them on a couch—keeping them in a conversation in a vein that’s comfortable but exploratory. They may have had advisory relationships before but it’s never mattered so much,” she adds. “They’ve taken the baby they birthed and grew for 20 or 25 years and converted it into a pile of money. Some can’t stand the notion of making a mistake with it because it’s so precious.”
Colpitts, the go-to person at Signature for complex corporate and personal income tax structures, also frames the client’s personal balance sheet within a business context—in other words, in language that is instantly understood. “It’s a little less squishy,” she notes. As well, she helps families with other issues that might affect their lives: private aviation, personal security, public relations and household staff management. “Generally there’s a financial piece to it,” says Colpitts. “If you run a business, you would have your CFO or COO do this work. Again, there’s a business parallel.”
Colpitts, who leads Signature’s client services team, is Signature’s brand builder. As the firm’s CEO Randy Webb observes: “What Susan does is challenge, engage and energize this team around the idea: If every Signature client were in a room no matter what level of wealth, they could compare their experience and the picture they paint would be the same. That’s huge. And it’s working.”
Why Signature? Having been a CPA, Colpitts watched a lot of people sign a lot of things with their own unique signature. Signature clients, signature solutions, a signature firm.
“It’s not that our clients have to fit into our boxes. We construct what they need and what they want and we do so in an environment of excellent planning and execution. We try to spend a lot of time just thinking in behalf of our clients,” says Colpitts. “We’re aiming before we shoot.”
Lynn Faust
Talk about a career of “firsts.” Not only was Lynn Faust the first female branch manager at Raymond James & Associates, she was also the first woman to serve on its executive council. With $350 million in assets under management, she is—no surprise here—one of the firm’s most successful advisors.
No wonder Dennis Zank, COO of Raymond James Financial, says of Faust: “Because of her enthusiasm, professionalism, dedication and willingness to give back, we wish we had many more Lynn Fausts in our firm.”
Faust, who describes herself as “driven” and “motivated,” does do things in an outsize manner. As an example, she has excelled at not just one career—but two of them. Faust, who grew up in a family of educators, taught elementary and middle school children for 12 years. After redesigning a university-level financial planning course, she decided to stick with teaching—only this time as a financial advisor.
“Education is a passion of mine. It’s how I got into the business; it’s why I got into the business,” says Faust, 64. “Teaching is my natural talent. It’s taken me wherever I’ve gone.”
Faust joined Waddell & Reed as a planner in 1979, then jumped to Paine Webber in 1981. A Raymond James & Associates advisor since 1988, Faust today serves 103 households with a typical account size of $2 million to $5 million. She also specializes in executive financial planning, working with senior executives in corporate settings.
While she has made history at Raymond James, Faust treats her groundbreaking performance strictly as a matter of fact. As she puts it: “I wanted to be a branch manager. It was something I was qualified to do, I was asked to do, and I did it like anyone else. I don’t carry a banner. I never felt like I needed to.”
As a producing branch manager, Faust for six years ran a Raymond James & Associates office in Greenville, S.C., that at its peak had 29 employees, including 16 advisors. Her chief challenge at that time: teaching employees to be organized.
“I think the biggest problem in this business is putting organization into your day. There are so many multi-tasking things you have to do. Some of those things you’re going to love, some you’re not going to like doing at all. The tendency is to do only what you like to do. Eventually, you need to hire to your weakness,” says Faust, who ranked as the largest producer in her office and region while running the branch. “You’re not going to be successful without putting organization into your practice and learning to do what you like least to do first. That’s what I brought to the table.”
In 2001, Faust gave up the branch to focus on her own practice with her son and business partner, Michael Faust. Ever the teacher, Faust helps clients create what she calls their “financial masterpieces of life.” When she first meets with a client, Faust starts out with a visual cue: a paper copy of a painting by Van Gogh or Matisse or another great artist that she then cuts into pieces.
“The cut up pieces represent the different phases of life, different goals and objectives: education, retirement, estate planning. It’s one way I help people understand there is more to money than just paying your bills and balancing your checkbook,” says Faust, whose Greer, S.C.-based team includes four advisors and three assistants. “I never throw the pieces away. They all go into a client folder.”
Faust also believes in keeping client conversations short.
“Advisors frequently do not realize that adults have an attention span of 15 to 20 minutes. You need to learn that when you present a financial plan, there is no way you are going to present everything at once,” Faust says. “Before a meeting, I determine what I can accommodate in 15 minutes that will hold your attention. That’s why teaching skills are the real essence to the success I’ve had in business. Clients feel I’m connected to their needs.”
“I also help clients understand how to achieve their goals. I don’t leave them out. And I use very simple explanations. Advisors as a rule tend to justify themselves by being very technical,” adds Faust, whose gold service standard includes a visit each year to all of her clients’ accountants. “I don’t think that wins the day.”
Faust is nothing if not nimble, an attribute she believes that, along with teaching, underlies her success.
“I’m never not energized. It’s true of anything I’ve ever done. I was not a burned out teacher. I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve ever done,” says Faust. “And I’m not afraid of change. If you’re not flexible, you will not be successful in this business. You can’t learn how to do it one day and do it that way for the rest of your life. That’s good for me. I’m Type A. It’s energizing. If this business is a passion for you, the way it is for me, you won’t ever want to leave it.”
Lorayne Fiorillo
A lot of elite advisors like to say they offer white-glove Ritz-Carlton-style service. Lorayne Fiorillo isn’t one of them.
“We take the gloves off and get down and dirty,” says Fiorillo. “Need a CPA who practices before the IRS to help with an audit—on a Saturday during a blizzard? Give us a call. Buying a car and need someone to negotiate with the dealership? Give us a call. If it’s beyond our professional capabilities, we’ll find someone in our professional network that can get the job done. We’re the cavalry who brings in the big guns or brings over the chicken soup. Whatever it is, the job gets done.”
Fiorillo, who heads Fiorillo Financial Strategies Group, recently marked her 25th year as an advisor, and yet she approaches each day with
exuberance. It’s not unusual for her to schedule 13 client appointments in a day. “A lot can change in somebody’s life,” says Fiorillo, 55, who likes to check in with clients as often as once a month. “It’s why we talk to people constantly. Plus, it’s so enjoyable.”
Clients, she says, are like snowflakes—each one different from the next. “Just because someone is 55 with two kids, you can’t put them in a box,” says Fiorillo, who manages $235 million in assets for 300 households. “It’s not one size fits all.”
And neither is Fiorillo’s approach to money management.
While she was one of the first to embrace professional outside money managers, she brought portfolio management in-house 10 years ago after the Internet bubble tanked. “I bought into the idea that all they do all day long is manage money; they’re better than I was,” says Fiorillo. “You know, they weren’t.” Today, she and her partner, Frank Pranio, use fundamental and technical analysis to build portfolios that include individual stocks, bonds, options and a broad array of ETFs. They also do a lot of covered call writing.
“The two of us manage it. It’s like playing the piano with four hands,” says Fiorillo. “Investing with us is like hiring a custom tailor. Everything is fitted to your exact measurements and then adjusted frequently to accommodate for life’s inevitable changes. We make sure that your investments suit you perfectly.”
Fiorillo originally set out to become a doctor but switched to finance because she considers it, too, a helping profession. She got her start with Prudential Securities in Charlotte, N.C., where she still has many clients.
“The first time I went with Lorayne to Charlotte to meet her clientele at an event we hosted, it was like they revered her like a rock star,” says Pranio. “At the end, people came up to me and said: ‘What’s it like working with Lorayne?’ as if I was in the presence of a celebrity.”
Admittedly, Fiorillo does have an outsize personality. “She’s found prospects riding the Metro North and at the opera. The fact is she loves what she does. She has that passion,” Pranio adds. “I sometimes sit here and look over at her and hear that exuberance and hear her ‘Yippees!’ She just enjoys what she does. It’s genuine.”
Not surprisingly, given her energy, Fiorillo fits a lot into her life. There’s her husband, a vet, and her 15-year-old son Max. At the moment, she is working on a charity event she is sponsoring for the Mecklenburg Medical Alliance and Endowment in North Carolina. “I’m ADHD when it comes to philanthropy,” she notes. Fiorillo also hosts a cooking show, Everyone Can Cook, for her local cable TV station. And she’s working on several writing projects.
One thing’s for sure, she is a communicator—and across platforms. She’s written a book, Financial Fitness in 45 Days: The Complete Guide to Shaping up Your Personal Finances. Until a few years ago, she was a personal finance columnist for Entrepreneur magazine. And when she still lived in Charlotte, she served as an on-air financial expert for a local TV station.
But, clearly, her big passion is for her clients.
The size of Fiorillo’s accounts are all over the place but, as she puts it: “I believe in dancing with the one that brung you. I have clients with $400,000 with me and $15 million to $20 million with me. People ask me, ‘What’s your minimum?’ It depends on how much I like you. Sometimes people really need help and they’re a nice person. I want to help them.” In addition to individuals, Fiorillo has two specialties. One is working with medical and veterinary practices, the other managing guardianships for people who have been declared incompetent.
Twenty-five years out, Fiorillo says her most important achievement is “how my clients feel about me.”
“One client, when she talked about working with me, said that when her CPA first introduced us, she thought I was a little weird. Now, that she has known me for 25 years, she is sure I’m weird, but I have also become her family’s most trusted advisor,” Fiorillo says. “Whenever anything goes wrong, she told me, no matter what it is, everyone says: ‘Call Lorayne.’”
Victor Hazard
Back in the mid-1980s, an entrepreneur named Herb D. Vest kept phoning Victor Hazard, inviting him to join a radical new start-up: a nationwide network of tax professionals who also offer investment advice.
“He called several times and I said we weren’t interested. Finally, one day, I listened to him for half an hour and it seemed to make so much sense,” says Hazard, a CPA who heads Hazard Financial in Lomita, Calif. “Why not offer full financial planning? It allows you to do such a better job for your client. Why not take it to the next step?”
Hazard, 69, was one of the early adopters of the pioneering business model and his practice today looks a lot like what Herb Vest envisioned 25 years ago.
As H.D. Vest president and COO Roger Ochs puts it: “He’s the stereotype of the successful CPA and financial advisor who not only prepares tax returns but, more importantly, helps clients with all their financial needs. That was the vision 25 years ago, and that’s the vision today. Victor just does it better than most of us.”
Hazard got his start in financial services in 1968 when he joined Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., then the world’s largest accounting firm. In 1982, he established his own CPA firm preparing taxes, audits, financial plans and financial statements for individuals and businesses. The H.D. Vest he joined in 1987 was, as he says, “hokey,” a much leaner version of today’s 4,800-advisor network.
At their first meetings with Hazard, for example, Barbara and Herb Vest would make a homemade lunch in their hotel room to share in the conference venue. Potato salad was often on the menu. And when he signed up to take his first securities exam, the Vests sent a grainy video—Barbara shot it, Herb was the presenter—advising him how to pass the Series 7 test. The firm assigned Hazard the number 868 when he hooked up with Vest; that is still the number that appears on most client statements today.
That, however, is about the only thing that has remained static at Hazard Financial, a full-service firm with $103 million in assets under management and an eight-person team that delivers multiple layers of service. At the top of the service tier: retirement and financial planning, tax advice and investment management. The Hazard team also offers advice in specialties such as insurance, estate planning, trust management, tax compliance, charitable giving, debt management and business planning. The firm’s tax compliance arm prepares over 1,000 corporate, fiduciary and personal income taxes each year.
The firm’s growth trajectory has been strong and steady, and perhaps more importantly, it has been intentional.
Hazard, for instance, heads the effort to plan for 20 high net worth families, representing 60 to 70 households. Does he want to grow that? No. “You can’t get too thin,” says Hazard, whose wife, Mary Jo, and daughters Jennifer and Jackie, work with him. “We don’t want to hire a lot more people and lose control of the personal relationship. To us, the personal relationship is everything. We decided to keep it at eight people—and that works perfectly for 20 families.”
Hazard Financial clients also include families that are juggling college savings with other financial goals. Many are multi-generational clients. Notably, the Hazard family itself recently became the first to have five generations with investment accounts.
Looking forward, Hazard says: “Markets are going to be more complex, no one knows the tax picture for next year, regulations require an extraordinary amount of effort, risk is everywhere and circumstances change daily. Our responsibility is to address all of the issues that managing wealth presents.”
Just this past year, Hazard received the premier designation of Personal Financial Specialist from the American Institute of CPAs and daughter Jennifer recently got her mortgage loan originator’s license—part of an ongoing strategy to enhance the firm’s service quotient. Hazard’s own personal growth trajectory—applying for Medicare and Social Security—has also helped deepen the bench.
“Five years ago, I applied for Medicare and found out, as most people do, that you can read up on it but you just don’t have a grasp unless you do it yourself. There’s so much that can fall through the cracks,” he says. “And there are so many different ways to deal with Social Security. There are hundreds of different options. Going through it yourself gives you a much different perspective. It’s made me a better advisor.”
There is one thing that has not changed—and that is Hazard’s fundamental belief in the first credential he got: the CPA.
“The one thing we focus on is having a written financial plan, and that’s what a CPA is trained to put together as opposed to someone who is more product-oriented. And here, you have someone who is trained in accounting as well as finance,” he says.
“If you look at most people we compete with, they send out fliers with their 1099s saying: ‘We take no responsibility for taxes. See a tax professional.’ From Ameritrade to Merrill Lynch to Schwab, there’s always this fine print that says you’re on your own for tax,” he adds. “You won’t get that from us. You’re assured of having someone who is looking at both sides of the equation: tax advice as well as financial advice. Herb Vest got it right.”
Howard Safer
When some clients began to turn bearish earlier this year, Howard Safer seized the moment—launching a dialogue he calls “cliff conversations.” A lame duck Congress and the unknowns involving tax law, capital gains, income rules and estate planning—he put it all on the table in seminars and one-on-one talks.
“Our role is to be the designated worrier for our clients,” says Safer, CEO of Argent Trust Company of Tennessee. “We take that to heart.”
The 69-year-old Safer, well known in trust company circles, also used the opportunity to showcase two words he tends to use a lot: safety and security.
“We believe trust companies are the peak of safety and security. It’s a good story to tell,” says Safer, a CPA who opened Argent Trust’s Nashville office in April. “We can do what everyone else can do, only better.”
Safer has had a storied career. Early on, he served as a controller for a New York Stock Exchange public company, as chief financial officer of a substantial private company and as managing partner of a 90-person CPA and consulting firm.
He went high profile, however, years, offering investment, estate and family office services. In an echo of his move from Bradford to Regions, he joined Argent when it was announced that the Morgan Keegan investment division was to be purchased by Raymond James Financial.
“Our clients enjoy it most in smaller environments like Bradford. It’s where you can be the most responsive,” says Safer, whose credentials include the Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) designation. “Many of our clients wanted us to be in something smaller. Here, we can do it all and we can do it better. And what we know we absolutely can do is save millions of dollars in taxes through trusts.”
Safer and daughter Mindy Hirt, vice president, oversee about $250 million in assets for 60 households. Senior investment strategist Frank Hosse rounds out the team. Hosse most recently served as chief investment officer for Regions Morgan Keegan Trust, a position he held with J.C. Bradford Trust before that.
Most of the team’s clients are business owners in operations as diverse as bottle manufacturing, real estate and skating rinks. All are millionaires. Notably, most of the accounts Safer and Hirt manage are what’s known as agency accounts—not trust accounts.
“There is a lot that’s misunderstood about trust companies. For one, you don’t have to have a trust to deal with a trust company. It’s a well-kept secret and that’s too bad,” says Safer. “The fact is this is a more extensive business to operate because we have more rules, regulations and auditors and, to me, that gives a high level of comfort to the investing public.”
Many of Safer’s clients are multi-generational. Often, parents will ask Safer to intervene in family conflicts.
“We’re the bad cop if we need to be with the next generation. They’ll tell the 28-year-old who wants to start up a business to ‘Go see Howard.’ I’ll ask for a business plan and there won’t be one. So I suggest taking a course or getting a job in that type of business,” Safer says. “It works well in protecting family assets. It doesn’t work well in terms of them liking us particularly. We get fired by the next generation half the time because we have done what we believe is best. As a trustee, that’s my judgment call. It’s what it’s all about.”
Safer and Hirt have worked together for 10 years—a family dynamic that both say adds an extra dimension to the family office they operate..”
Hirt adds that part of the pleasure of partnering with her father is designing creative solutions for clients.
“There’s a level of excitement in terms of being able to come up with an idea that can save a thousand dollars a month by refinancing a loan or save a million dollars by creating a family limited partnership,” she notes. “Howard also taught me early on to go to a client with three bullet points. Keep it simple. A lot of things we’re dealing with are not simple concepts and it helps to present them in a digestible form.”
Most firm mission statements gather dust. Not so here. Safer often quotes from Argent’s.
“Argent’s mission statement involves our clients, associates and investors. We are passionate advocates for them, their heirs and their charities,” says Safer. “We’re energized when they are happier in achieving their goals. We’re fulfilled when their families live in harmony with positive values. When it’s all said and done, that’s what we’re about.”

One of many moving stories of Hurricane Sandy involved a family in an affluent area of New York awakened by the rush of water into their home.
As the floodwaters rose, the father led his family up to their attic, whence they were rescued several hours later. A neighbor, who saw the father the next day carrying what few belongings he was able to salvage in a gym bag, asked him how he was doing. The fellow, who had just lost his house to Sandy, smiled and said “Thank God. Everything is great!” Seeing the neighbor’s jaw drop, he quickly added “I have my wife and kids. That’s all I need.”
Sandy destroyed this man’s home, his possessions and his net worth, but it could not defeat his spirit. Indeed, it brought out his greatness. Let’s face it—losses can be psychologically devastating. Behavioral finance research has shown that people experience the pain of loss with something like two and a half times the intensity of the joy of gain. Indeed, there are people who spend their lives wallowing in misery over some past loss—the deal that fell apart, the cushy gig that seemingly slipped away, the relationship that just didn’t work out.
And while many are stuck in the past, there are probably just as many who fantasize about a future that will likely never occur. If only I had this job, this relationship, or this whatever … I’d be happy.
But the future cannot be acquired any more than the past recovered. The only reality is in the present, where an unfalsifiable accounting of your true spiritual and material resources resides. Troubled by your past? Then build yourself up—starting from those resources. Have a vision for a certain kind of future? Then build that future, realistically, using those resources at your disposal.
It is an intrinsic part of our natures, and a necessary one too, to want things. Without powerful material drives, we’d never build, create or sustain anything. But it takes greatness to match your wants to your needs, as this storm-tossed man did.
Hurricane Sandy confronted a large number of Americans with losses of things they might have taken for granted—like power, running water, a clean, safe home, and perhaps even their loved ones. How many people turn on a light switch, or bite into a fresh fruit, and express gratitude for that small miracle?
In Sandy’s wake, and with the knowledge that life will inevitably bring fresh disturbances to our peace, we’d all do well to renew our appreciation for our own bountiful inventory of personal resources, which is probably greater than we might at first think. As Americans bathe in the glow of Chanukah and Christmas lights soon upon us, can we express our gratitude for having what we need?

An industry rule of thumb is that ETFs with less than $50 million in assets don’t long survive. But those between $50 million and $100 million? They may be just what your clients are looking for.
Todd Rosenbluth, S&P Capital IQ’s director of ETF research, points to a number of ETFs with asset bases below $100 million that are ranked favorably by S&P Capital IQ. However, when looking at these ETFs, he cautions that it is important to understand the cost factor implications, as some of the smaller ETFs incur high costs.
“There is a repeatedly shown wireless phone commercial about one company's 4G data services that claims, 'It's not complicated. Bigger is better,'" Rosenbluth begins in newsletter commentary. “For exchange-traded funds (ETFs), this is not always the case.”
He explains that while some investors may look for the ETF with the most assets within a given style, others that have long focused on mutual funds may be drawn in by an ETF's strong performance record.
“[We] believe both approaches miss out on a number of factors, including that ETFs with limited asset bases tend to have higher expense ratios, less liquidity due to limited trading activity, and trade above or below their net asset value, thus costing more.”
Less frequent trading, he adds, can lead to wide bid/ask spreads, which is the gap between the price buyers are willing to pay for shares of an ETF and the price sellers are asking. The wider the spread, the bigger the bite taken out of investors' returns every time they buy or sell. A lack of liquidity also may cause the ETF to trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value of the fund's underlying holdings.
“That means an investor buying the fund may overpay for that portfolio or the seller may get less than assets are worth,” he argues. “Ideally, you can find an ETF with a style you favor that has a tight bid/ask spread and trades in line with its NAV because you need to not only get in but also get at a later date. S&P Capital IQ uses these two cost factors, along with analysis of an ETF's expense ratio, to support our ranking process of 750 equity ETFs. According to BlackRock, over $47 billion was added to equity exchange traded products in the first two months of 2013.”
He points to the small-cap ETF space as on such example these high costs, and specifically PowerShares.
While PowerShares has gathered assets for a number of its fundamentally driven ETFs, PowerShares Fundamental Pure Small Core Portfolio (PXSC) is not one of them. PXSC has just $15 million in assets, and just over 800 shares trade hands each day. As a result, this ETF has a relatively wide bid/ask spread and a high 1.22% gross expense ratio, though PowerShares has agreed to waive 0.83% of these costs until at least August 2013, in an attempt, we think, to make PXSC more competitive. So while PXSC's market price total return of 9.7% year to date through March 4 is encouraging, the ETF has unfavorable cost factors to S&P Capital IQ.
A larger and better alternative, according to Rosenbluth, is the iShares Russell 2000 Index (IWM). IWM rose 8.1% year to date, narrowly lagging PXSC. While this ETF is a more traditional index ETF that is not tied to a benchmark that uses dividends or cash flow analysis, it is a lower-cost, more actively traded option. IWM has $19 billion in assets, and more than 30 million shares change hands daily.
“The bid/ask spread is tight and the gross expense ratio is just 0.23%,” Rosenbluth writes.
Lastly, he points to RevenueShares Navellier Overall A-100 Fund (RWV) as an example of “where bigger is not better." RWV's NAV is up 13% year to date through March 4, putting it among the 50 top-performing equity ETFs this year. The ETF is tied to an index that aims to identify the 100 highest quality stocks in the U.S. using factors such as earnings growth, free cash flow and return on equity.
However, he concludes, there is “only $7 million in assets in this ETF and the average daily volume is just 500 shares. Based on this, it is should be no surprise that the bid/ask spread is relatively wide and the gross expense ratio of 1.42% (net of 0.60% after fee waiving) is above average.”

Variety reports that Strangers on a Train, the thriller by lesbian author Patricia Highsmith memorably brought to the screen in 1951 by Alfred Hitchcock, is gearing up for another foray into the movies. Producers Arnold and Anne Kopelson are developing a new Strangers at Warner Bros., and writer David Seltzer (Dragonfly, The Omen) has delivered a script. The novel tells the twisted tale of a tennis pro awaiting a divorce from his wife who, on board a train, meets a mother-dominated eccentric who proposes the two swap murders. The tennis pro assumes the other man is kidding until the pro's wife turns up dead and the eccentric expects payback. Hitchcock kept the homoerotic undertones of the novel in his film version.
Other recent Highsmith adaptations include The Talented Mr. Ripley and the upcoming Ripley's Game.

Man Headbutts Wife in Horrible Ad for Social-Event Website Play on site's name gets lost in translation
Here's your daily dose of horrible violence against women in advertising—a Portuguese commercial for a social-events website in which a husband gives his wife a nasty headbutt. Lovely. Adweek's resident Portuguese expert, Nick Mrozowski, who sent us this link about the spot, tells us the attack is supposed to be a play on the site's name: "Vai Bater can translate literally to 'go hit,' but the name of the site is more likely a reference to a heartbeat, as in 'a sua coração vai bater,' or 'your heart will beat,' as in, these events are exciting … and maybe you'll find a better girlfriend there. So, the ad is a play on the double meaning." Needless to say, bashing a woman in the head in service to a pun is a questionable tactic. The tagline is: "Vai Bater! Events close to you. Choose the event. Live the moment!" The woman in the ad is Monica Sofia, a singer and Playboy model. The man is apparently her real-life husband.

Looks like there's a new vacancy at the Bates Motel. A&E has green-lit the Psycho prequel, announced as a development slate line-item last year. The network will broadcast 10 episodes of the series with no initial pilot order—the showrunner on the project is Carlton Cuse, of Lost fame. The series is set to premiere in 2013..
<|endofexample|>
In October when Yahoo launched a slate of original Web videos [1], the company announced that it wanted to be the “broadcast network of the digital age.” It was an ambitious goal for a company whose competition included Google’s YouTube and its $100 million original content project and Hulu, which is backed by some of the biggest actual TV networks..
Among the additions are a fashion series with designer Rebecca Minkoff and a show with entertainment news reporter Michael Yo. Returning shows include Judy Greer’s Reluctantly Healthy, Niecy Nash’s Let’s Talk About Love and Ultimate Surprise, an expansion of Ultimate Proposal hosted by Cameron Mathison.
For the shows’ producers, the challenge is adapting TV-quality content to Web viewers’ shorter attention spans. But Bruce Gersh, CEO, and David Beebe, vp and gm, of FishBowl Worldwide Media, which produces Ultimate Surprise, said they’ve found the answer with emotional, relatable stories that get audiences to watch and share content online. “It all goes back to great storytelling,” said Beebe. “We just have to cut it down to five minutes.”
Nash said the Web also offers something TV doesn’t: time to grow. On TV, Let’s Talk About Love would have been under pressure to hit certain numbers on day one. But online shows can grow organically and incorporate advertising as the audience expands, Nash argued.
Advertisers seem happy. “Yahoo’s women’s slate significantly outperformed the other video programs supporting the 2012 Toyota Camry launch campaign,” said Dionne Colvin, national marketing media manager for Toyota. “Online video tends to be more engaging and offers higher conversion rates than other mediums.” But the space is getting crowded.
“Yahoo’s done a great job with developing new content and the way they’ve marketed and positioned it,” said Adam Kasper, evp of digital investments at Havas Digital. “But they’re only going to be facing increased competition in this area.”

Okay I think this sweater would have been better if it had a little more stretch to it. It was a little tighter than my normal size.. which disappointed me a bit. Nevertheless, I kept it because I loved the color. The strings are cute as well! July 8, 2012
Cheap, Strechted Out and Fraying I bought this sweater in Dashing Teal in size XL. The material at first was cheap and thin, but fine for a lounge hoodie in warm weather. After I washed it, the sweater stretched out compleatly and it shed blue cotton in all the other clothes I washed it with and continued to shed when I wore it. The ends of the fabric statred to fray aswell. If you are intent on buying this hoodie, SIZE DOWN. because it stretches, and be informed that the colours appear differently than the picture. June 26, 2012
Was More of a Hot Pink, Not Red Was excited for this to arrive, had been looking for a cute red hoodie. However the pic online looks red, the sweatshirt arrived and was definitely more pink than red. Also, material is flimsy and cheap. The sweatshirt also runs short. The seaming on the arms by the shoulder makes your torso look wide. It had so much potential from the pic online but will be returning this one. May 12, 2012
Great fit and very comfortable I'm 5'4'', 34B, average build. This hoodie fits perfectly, fitted in all the right places. I also love that the sleeves aren't too short. The material is so comfortable, thin but still warm. I would have given it five stars if the color wasn't so off. This sweatshirt isn't anywhere near the teal depicted in the picture. It is more of a neon green. I'm not in love with the color at all, but I couldn't send it back after loving the fit. May 4, 2012

The Eurozone Crisis and the US Economy: What Has Gone Wrong?
Download PDF The United States and Europe are currently embroiled in interconnected economic crises that represent a threat not only to their own citizens but also to the world economy as a whole. Although previous US stimulus attempts have failed, a new stimulus package has been proposed that is likely to have a similar result. In the midst of this economic uncertainty, investors have increasingly turned to low-risk, but low-return, investment options such as money market accounts. These investments serve as lenders to European governments that are currently sharing the large amounts of sovereign debt of southern European countries such as Greece, making them less stable investment options for US investors. There is no easy way to reverse these crises.
Key Points in this Outlook
Simultaneous economic crises in the United States and Europe have created a serious threat to the world economy.
Recent US stimulus efforts have failed to boost the economy, and this pattern is likely to continue with future proposed stimulus plans.
Many of Europe's problems stem from its adoption of a monetary union, which has increased shared risk from southern European sovereign debt.
No easy solutions to these crises exist; one crucial, but inadequate, step is for central banks and the United States to work together to preempt deflation.
The first paragraph of an article on how to save the euro in a recent issue of the Economist captures a significant part of what has gone wrong with the European economy..[1]
As we enter the fall of 2011, three years after the Lehman Brothers crisis, Europe and the United States are teetering on the brink of another, potentially more serious, systemic crisis. It is surely fair to ask how we got to this point just a few months after the US recovery had been declared well-established and European leaders had created a fund with resources that were supposed to be sufficient to ensure that Greece, the fulcrum of Europe's debt crisis, would not default on its debt. Figure 1 shows the sharp rise in interest rates on some European governments' debt--especially Greece, Ireland, and Portugal--and a recent jump in Spanish and Italian yields that is emblematic of Europe's intensifying debt crisis.
The crisis in Europe is somewhat mirrored and amplified by a parallel sharp growth slowdown in the United States. After last year's second round of quantitative easing (QE2) and extra fiscal stimulus spawned expectations of 3.5 percent growth, actual US first-half growth of only 0.7 percent has changed everything. During the spring, the Federal Reserve began talking about detailed strategy for exiting high levels of monetary accommodation, while during July's debt-ceiling fiasco, US policymakers wrestled with the need to reduce deficits and debt accumulation. In the end, they left the heavy lifting to a congressional "super committee" that is to report back to President Obama by Thanksgiving. But before the super committee could even meet, the president reversed course in the face of the threat of a double-dip recession and proposed nearly a half trillion dollars in additional fiscal stimulus for 2012 that repeated and expanded measures the last Congress passed in December 2010.
Americans who follow deliberations in Washington, especially about taxes and government spending, can be forgiven some confusion. During much of the second quarter in the lead-up to the July debt-ceiling debate, which was punctuated by threats of America's default on its debt, politicians loudly touted the benefits of living within our means, which meant cutting the deficit, which in turn meant cutting government spending, raising taxes, or both. As Congress returned from vacation, the president offered up a jobs program costing nearly half a trillion dollars that involves cutting taxes and increasing government spending.
Of course, the president followed up his jobs plan with proposals for future tax increases and spending cuts he claimed would provide more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the ten years after 2013 "as the economy grows stronger."[2] It seems unlikely, though, that the tax cuts and higher spending that are supposed to make the economy stronger in 2012 will, when reversed in 2013, somehow not cause it to grow weaker.
We, and many in Europe, are left to wonder whether it is deficit reduction that is good for the economy or euphemistically named things like "jobs programs" that increase the deficit. It is important to ask how, at the time of this writing in September 2011, Europe has reached an acute sovereign-debt crisis while the US economy simultaneously threatens to contract, exacerbating both its own budgetary problems and Europe's sovereign-debt crisis.
What Happened in Europe?
Europe's problems, which are probably more acute than America's, spring from a simple cause: an attempt to forge and maintain an impossible currency union. The European Monetary Union, which includes such disparate economies as Germany on the strong side and Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy on the weak side, requires the assumption that monetary policy that is appropriate for Germany is also appropriate for Greece. Europe's adoption of monetary union enabled less credit-worthy countries such as Greece to borrow on virtually the same terms as Germany because both were issuing debt denominated in euros and the European Central Bank (ECB) was treating those debts as being of identical quality.
The European Monetary Union was, at first, attractive for all of its members, including Germany. European banks were happy to make euro-denominated loans to government and private borrowers in southern Europe who could suddenly borrow for less, given that the loans were denominated in euros. If a bank lent money to, for example, the Greek government, it acquired a claim on Greece that it could take to the ECB and use as collateral for further borrowing. The terms for that transaction were virtually identical to the terms available if claims on the German government were used as collateral. Easy credit accelerated European growth, not to mention German exports. As inflation and growth surged in southern Europe, so too did borrowing in those countries.
Adoption of the euro by countries like Greece and Spain meant that they got a German credit rating that enabled them to purchase more Mercedes--on credit. At first, German exporters were pleased. But now, Germans are being asked to help borrowers in these southern European countries repay these loans.
By 2009, some lenders began to notice that Greek budget deficits and government debt were rising rapidly. When Greece revealed late in 2009 that its deficits and debt were substantially larger than previously reported, the first phase of the European debt crisis began. However, the ECB continued to allow banks to use Greek, Italian, Spanish, and any other sovereign debt from the European Monetary Union as collateral for loans. Banks were also not required to hold reserves against their sovereign-debt loans because it was effectively assumed that sovereigns do not default.
The solution to the Greek crisis that emerged in the spring of 2010 was essentially perverse. In exchange for additional loans so that Greece could roll over its debts and pay its debt service, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union imposed strict conditions on Greece in the form of higher taxes and sharply contractionary cuts in government spending that caused the economy to slow further, undercutting its ability to service outstanding debt and additional debt.
By the second quarter of 2011, it was clear that Greece would require additional funding to meet its debt service obligations, while similar problems arose for Portugal, Spain, and Italy. Ten years of pretending that loans to southern European governments carried as little risk as loans to the German government left Europe's banks with nearly $2 trillion worth of claims on those riskier borrowers. For the purpose of "stress tests," it was assumed that these claims were worth 100 cents on the dollar when the marketplace implies substantially lower values. The large sovereign-debt holdings by European banks pose a threat to the solvency of many of those banks that rises in proportion to doubts about governments' ability to service those loans. Given these conditions, if Greece, for example, defaults on its debts, the possibility of defaults by other sovereign governments in Europe may rise, triggering solvency problems for most of Europe's private banks.
Many hope to preempt this disaster scenario by recommending aggressive steps to prevent a Greek default. The problem is that Germany, the country that would have to foot most of the bill, is insisting that Greece adopt additional austerity conditions in exchange for the loan. The austerity conditions, in turn, imply that Greece will be less able to service its debts a year from now, given that the economy is expected to contract at a 5 percent rate if these austerity conditions are imposed.
Impact of Europe's Debt Crisis on the United States
Americans are exposed to the European debt crisis through money market funds, among other channels. The rapid slowdown of US economic growth, along with the elevated uncertainty tied to July's debt-ceiling fiasco, caused many households to sell stocks during August. Typically, investors move such funds into "cash equivalents" or money market funds, which pay virtually no interest but are meant to be highly liquid should households need to reinvest the funds or to purchase goods and services. As Europe's debt crisis intensified during the summer, US money market funds were, in effect, lending heavily to European banks that in turn were significantly exposed to shaky sovereign-debt issuers like Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. The result was that Americans who wanted to avoid more risk by exiting stocks and entering money market funds were effectively lending to Greece and Portugal. This discovery led money market funds to sharply reduce their exposure to European sovereign debt as depositors began to exit for fear that the funds would be vulnerable to a Greek default and other European sovereign-debt problems.
The search for safety outside money market funds drove risk-averse American investors into US Treasury bills, bonds, and notes. As a result, the yield on four-week and three-month Treasury bills was driven to zero or below by late August, while the yield on one-year Treasury bills was driven to an incredibly low six basis points. So desperate were American households, and undoubtedly some firms, for a risk-free cash repository that in some cases they were willing to pay the US government one or two basis points for the privilege of lending to the government for a short period. Those who wanted more yield bought ten-year notes and thirty-year bonds, pushing yields on ten-year notes below 2 percent, even lower than they had been after the Lehman crisis, and yields on thirty-year bonds down to 3.25 percent or below. Other investors seeking safety and expecting higher inflation bought gold, pushing its price over $1,900 per ounce at some points.
It is worth commenting on the simultaneous increase in the price of gold and the drop in interest rates on thirty-year bonds. Because gold pays no return, buyers are essentially betting on an increasing price of gold to reward them. If inflation continues to rise, as gold buyers expect, purchasers of thirty-year bonds will be at risk since they will be paid back in dollars with less purchasing power. As a result, the most popular fixed-income instrument, whose returns rival that of gold during 2011, have been US Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). So eager are investors for a safe haven that the real yield on TIPS has been driven well below -1 percent. That means buyers of TIPS are willing to pay the US government more than a percentage point for the privilege of owning a long-term, inflation-protected asset.
But why are some investors betting on inflation by purchasing gold while others are willing to bid up prices on long-term Treasuries that would be harmed by higher inflation? The answer may be that the extremely high level of uncertainty in financial markets implies a wide range of possible outcomes, including both higher inflation and deflation. Gold is a somewhat illiquid way to play the inflation scenario, while longer-term Treasuries are a bet on the deflation outcome. Investors who remember Japan's deflationary experience after 1998 and the resulting drop in long-term interest rates to below 1 percent may buy Treasury bonds, while those who fear debasement of paper money may buy gold. Gold buyers are also concentrated in countries like China and India where local-currency, long-term government securities are not available and gold is the preferred safe-haven asset.
No Place to Hide
The systemic mess the United States and Europe--and eventually, the rest of the world--are facing in the fall of 2011 is greater than the sum of its parts. The US economy slowed down even after substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus had been applied. The slowdown was surprising and also disconcerting to policymakers who had to entertain the notion that the policy levers they were pulling were no longer effective. Just as these disquieting realizations were arising in the United States, the European debt crisis reintensified as Greece teetered on the edge of default and the crisis environment spread to the rest of southern Europe. These conditions raise some serious questions.
Why Isn't the US Stimulus Working?
The short answer is this: monetary policy is not stimulating the economy because the United States is in a liquidity trap. At first, the Fed's QE2 was followed by higher interest rates as markets expected further growth. But as growth failed to materialize, interest rates came back down, stock markets weakened, and funds went back into cash. Viewed another way, the Fed's QE2 initially induced investors to put more money into riskier assets like stocks, but when growth failed to materialize, the funds left those riskier assets for cash. It was additionally disconcerting that one of the first cash destinations, money market funds turned out to be essentially lending to European borrowers who were even riskier than US borrowers. As a result, funds flowed into the Treasury markets, pushing short-term Treasury yields to zero or below. Those fearing eventual currency debasement and inflation bought gold.
The Fed's latest attempt to offer additional stimulusis somewhat bizarre. After its August meeting, the Fed indicated strongly that it would hold short-term interest rates at zero for another two years. That amounts to promising that the economy will not recover for two years because if it did, short-term interest rates would rise as cash balances sought higher returns on investments in the equity markets, which would improve as the economy improves. Those seeking a positive return on investments must bet either on higher inflation and buy gold or on higher growth and buy stocks.
The Fed has sought to push down immediate and longer-term interest rates with Operation Twist, whereby it is concentrating its purchases in the Treasury market on ten-year notes and thirty-year bonds at the expense of shorter-term bills and notes for which interest rates are already virtually zero. Lower interest rates--even lower longer-term ones--are not likely to produce much growth in an economy with virtually no demand for credit from qualified borrowers.
Fiscal stimulus is not working because the constraints of rising deficits and resulting debt mean that it is by definition temporary and must be reversed after implementation. Last December, the Obama administration announced tempor-ary tax cuts. Enactment boosted incomes, but termination a year later will slow their growth. Obama's early-September 2011 proposal for a $450 billion stimulus package for 2012 was followed in mid-September by another package proposal that promised more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction--nearly ten times the stimulus proposal--over the next decade. The impetus for Obama's 2012 stimulus was the end of the 2011 stimulus, which not only did not work to boost the economy but also will cause a slower economy once it ends. In other words, because the 2011 stimulus did not work, the president is claiming that we need another one in 2012 that will be reversed in 2013.
Why Doesn't Europe Either Let Greece Default or Bail It Out?
The question of Greek debt has to be addressed very soon. If Greece unilaterally defaults, fears of defaults elsewhere in southern Europe may produce a run on European banks that hold claims on those countries, leading to a full-blown financial crisis in Europe. It probably would be better for the ECB--or the ECB, European Union, and IMF, collectively--to offer unconditional guarantees on sovereign European debt. This would mean the euro would likely end up as a relatively soft currency, so the German government, which would have to fund much of the sovereign-debt bailout, has so far refused to agree to this plan. Given the cumbersome nature of the European Monetary Union and its institutions, it appears likely that an agreement will not be reached and that some kind of Greek default, probably preceded by capital controls, will occur before the end of this year. The fallout, sharply lower European growth and sharply elevated financial -turmoil, will be negative for the United States and the rest of the world.
What Should the United States Do?
This fall, while Europe is awaiting Greece's impending default, it appears that American policymakers will repeat July's debt-ceiling fiasco: ambivalence about whether tighter or easier fiscal policy is better for the United States (that is, are we supposed to raise deficits or reduce them?) will be rendered moot by the super committee's likely inability to find an additional $1.5 trillion (or more, if any stimulus measures are enacted) in deficit cuts over the next ten years. If that is the case and US fiscal policy essentially continues on its current path through the end of the year, while Europe is in a default mess the United States will be experiencing fiscal drag equal to about two percentage points of gross domestic product, exacerbating any global slowdown caused by a failure to resolve Europe's debt mess.
No easy or obvious ways exist to bypass this bad outlook that has grown out of the inability of European and US economic policymakers to make hard decisions over the last several years. The signs that such an outcome is becoming more likely include a slowdown in inflation and a threat of deflation as more households and businesses seek the relative safety of cash equivalents like Treasury bills and rein in their spending in anticipation of substantial financial turbulence and slower growth. That development, coupled with the surge in demand for liquid assets that usually accompanies an acute financial crisis, will require central banks to print a lot more money to avoid a self-reinforcing deflationary disaster that raises the real debt burden at the root of the problem faced by banks and governments in Europe and banks and households in the United States.
One encouraging sign is that we may already have seen an initial step towards preempting deflation. On September 15, the Fed, in conjunction with the central banks of Europe, Great Britain, Switzerland, and Japan, arranged to supply dollars to Europe's banking system. The flow of dollars to Europe's banks has dried up as other banks and US money market funds feared their exposure to large quantities of sovereign debt issued by southern European countries. The swap lines, as they are called, will be available to help with year-end funding needs by supplying the dollars European banks need to finance their dollar loans and other dollar liabilities. At the least, this step represents a solid move toward financial coordination among central banks that may help ease what appears to be an upcoming global financial mess.

So while the power is still on, heat up this drink and cuddle up on your couch with a cozy blanket and a good book. It is like pumpkin pie in a mug, and way better (and cheaper) than the pumpkin spice lattes peddled at your local cafe.
Pumpkin Spice Cafe au Lait
Makes 2 16-oz mugs
4 ounces light coconut milk
4 ounces water
16 ounces non-fat milk
8 ounces freshly brewed coffee
1 cinnamon stick
1/4 cup canned pumpkin
2 Tablespoons sugar
In a medium saucepan, heat coconut milk, water, milk and coffee over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick and turn down to medium low for 10 minutes. Whisk in pumpkin and sugar until fully dissolved. Serve in two large mugs.
The key to this recipe is the cinnamon sticks. They add a depth of flavor not reached when you sprinkle ground cinnamon. I usually add ground cinnamon to my coffee, but it leaves a congealed mess at the bottom, like the soggy crumbs from a chocolate chip cookie drowned at the bottom of a glass of milk. Using the cinnamon sticks gives you the flavor without the soggy fuss.
And so you know, we've added a new member to the family! Meet Honey, a 3-year old greyhound rescue who is sweet as can be. If there's any leftover canned pumpkin from this recipe, she'll be glad to eat it.
oh lil honey! stay safe and warm!
Yeah the hurricane was in full force down here as well. This recipe sounds perfect for a day like yesterday!
I have a question - have you tried sprinkling cinnamon in with your coffee grounds and brewing it in? You get a subtle cinnamon flavor without the gunk at the bottom. Try it out and let me know what you think!
We loved the coffee, thanks. How was the hurricane?

How to deepen ties with IndonesiaPUBLISHED: 22 May 2012 00:05:26 | UPDATED: 22 May 2012 04:15:41PUBLISHED: 22 May 2012 PRINT EDITION: 22 May 2012
The Australian Financial Review
Relations between Australia and Indonesia will always be challenging given that no two neighbours are more dissimilar in so many ways. It is not surprising that tensions arise over issues such as the slaughtering of cattle, the treatment of drug traffickers and people smugglers, and the stationing of American Marines on Australian soil. Domestic political considerations and misunderstandings can too easily flare up over such controversies.
Yet high-level relations between our two countries are in fairly good shape. This partly reflects Australia’s investment in Indonesia through close interactions with its military, police and bureaucracy, as well as its disaster, health and education systems. Indonesia is our largest foreign aid recipient: we are building or extending thousands of schools, in part to boost an alternative to Middle Eastern Islamic fundamentalism.
The relationship also benefits from the number of leading Indonesians who have studied in Australia, such as Vice-President Boediono and Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa. Many of them now send their children to Australian universities. There are 18,000 Indonesians studying in Australia.
This interaction should be expanded by welcoming more Indonesians to fill our labour shortages. At least 3 million Indonesians earn valuable incomes for their families by working abroad, including as domestic labour in Saudi Arabia and on oil palm plantations in Malaysia, sometimes in poor or shocking circumstances. They would be better served filling our shortages of nannies or aged-care workers. Including this in the broader relationship with Indonesia would benefit Australia while deepening relations with our valued neighbour.

Good day gentleman
I have been in contact with numerous friends who breed lion and as far as we know lions or the hunting of them would not be closing however US Fish and Wildlife will no doubt stop issuing cities permits making it illegal to export lion in to the US. This is not likely to happen next year but I do expect US Fish and Wildlife to stop issuing cities permits on lion within the next two years.
This will no doubt be to the detriment of our lion populations none will be effected more so than our wild lion populations plus not being able to export lion to the US will defiantly cause South Africa to cut back on the breeding of lions. The lion bone trade is a very real threat to ALL LIONS! With a constant supply of captive bread lion bones being possibly cut in have at the very least (please note that I do not agree with the lion bone trade nor do I support it but I am afraid it does exist and there is a big market for these bones, we have to be real about it) all the pressure will fall on our wild lion populations. We would no doubt see a lot of lions being pouched all over Africa in Nature Reserves and Game Management Area's!
It is a simply questions of supply and demand, the demand is currently there and having less lion bones around will no doubt raise the price of the supply making it worth while for poachers to take the big risk of pouching in our National Parks and other wild areas?
To add to the problem poachers do not pouch according to a quota, nor do they care if the animal is mature or not, they would also use methods like snaring, poison and other forms of trapping since they are a bunch of scared spineless idiots!
This will also help insure that other animals also get snared, trapped or poisoned just as an example leopards but don't worry those bones will be exported to Asia as well?
It is funny how we have had the discussion hunting wild vs captive bread lions for years now. The majority of us could never agree on the topic the irony is, look where we are heading now thanks to standing divided on the topic, lion hunting will no doubt close for our US clients at the very least and the lion populations of Africa will be under pressure more than ever!
I am afraid the fact that we as hunters can not even tolerate or respect each others choices has left the door open for the greenies to ensure the the King of Africa will be nothing more than a tame zoo animal and a great memory for the few who were ever fortunate enough to experience hunting a lion be it wild or captive bread?
This is very very sad news for hunters and the lion populations all over Africa![SIGPIC][/SIGPIC]

Twenty-four sub-species classifications have been suggested for modern lions.
Some even question the sub-species classification of the Asiatic lion, currently classified as P.l. persica, due to the limited genetic difference (1.1%) to African lions this difference being smaller than those found between human racial groups.
The IUCN currently recognizes two extant sub-species of lion:
African lion Panthera leo leo (Linnaeus, 1758)
Asiatic lion Panthera leo persica (Meyer, 1826
It could be that in the near future if a person from the US wants to hunt Lion it will be a captive breed or a darted and photo entery only and that is sad.Enjoy life now -- it has an expiration date.

what you have to remember is kenya at the last 3 or so international cites conferences has lobbied for lions to be moved to appendix one of cities. most of the southern african countries along with other countries they brought on side managed to out vote and defeat this proposal. kenya is used as the puppet and funded in this effort by some of the biggest anti hunting organisations who also have accredited NGO status. seems like their propoganda/lobbying is working.............

I am not interested in hunting Lions myself, but I am totally able to see that if the US hunters can't import Lion trophies, then this is going to be a large threat to wild Lions.
I am sure a large majority of Lions hunted are hunted by US hunters.
Not only will we get a massive increase in wild Lions poached for the bones, but we will also see many more wild Lions killed because they will have no value for the locals around in Africa anymore.
The Lions will just be a danger to their life and their domestic animals and not a source of income.

African Americans, former slaves, migrated to Illinois to settle. Many were brought to Illinois by their slavemasters and set free. Slave traders would often kidnap them, carry them south, and sell them back into slavery. A 100% profit.
Charles Adams, a free black born abt 1790, lived in Illinois with his wife, Maria Adams, a free black born abt 1794. In 1842, Maria and seven or eight of their small children were kidnapped by slave traders. The slave trader, Kuykendall, also kidnapped in Illinois and sold in 1839 a free black named Lewis Adams, born 1824, and died 1930 in Copiah County, Mississippi.
1842 is the same year that my great grandfather, Mingo Adams born 1833, and his brother, Levi Adams born abt 1832, and sister, Sarah Adams born abt 1831, were deeded as gifts by a plantation owner in Copiah County, Mississippi. I do not know if they are Charles and Maria's children.
Years ago, my grandfather, Stewart, told me that his family lived in Illinois but were "taken back to slavery". This was one of my reasons for focusing part of my family history research on Illinois during the slavery period. This brought me to getting involved with events in Coles County such as Trial & Tribulations and the play "Three-Fifths of a Man".

13,000 Missouri Home Care Workers Win Final Legal Challenge, Now Set to Bargain First Union Contract
by David Patterson | November 14, 2012
WASHINGTON, DC – In a four-year struggle to have a voice on the job, improve working conditions and strengthen the quality of care for the people they serve, 13,000 Missouri home care workers cleared the last legal obstacle that has delayed negotiations on their first contract with the state.
The Missouri Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal to a lower court decision upholding the results of a 2010 election in which the state's home care workers voted to form a union. The ruling represents the legal end of the line for the union’s opponents, who had sought to invalidate the results of the election and obstruct collective bargaining on behalf of workers who provide vital home care to the state’s seniors and people with disabilities.
“Since 2008, Missouri home care workers have sought to have their voices heard, only to see opponents tie up their efforts in the courts,” said AFSCME Pres. Lee Saunders, whose union represents the home care workers in a coalition with SEIU. “This court decision represents a huge victory for these workers and will now finally allow them to begin bargaining for their first union contract.”
The state’s home care workers won the right to form a union after Missouri voters passed the Missouri Quality Home Care Act in 2008 by a resounding 75-percent majority. Home care workers subsequently voted to form their union, and opponents sought to stymie them in the courts.
“This ruling is a huge relief to people like me who rely on home care providers to help us live independently and stay out of nursing homes,” said Edna Austin of Crystal City, Mo. “The union will give them the resources they need to improve their working conditions, reduce turnover and provide more security for families who hire them.”
Home care workers perform essential services such as cooking, cleaning and emergency response. They are also instrumental in curtailing nursing home costs the state would incur if home care wasn’t available.

Protein-Based Coating Could Help Rehabilitate Long-Term Brain Function
Tuesday, July 31, 2012
TAU researchers develop bioactive coating to "camouflage" neutral electrodes
Brain-computer interfaces are at the cutting edge for treatment of neurological and psychological disorder, including Parkinson's, epilepsy, and depression. Among the most promising advance is deep brain stimulation (DBS) — a method in which a silicon chip implanted under the skin ejects high frequency currents that are transferred to the brain through implanted electrodes that transmit and receive the signals. These technologies require a seamless interaction between the brain and the hardware.
But there's a catch. Identified as foreign bodies by the immune system, the brain attacks the electrodes and forms a barrier to the brain tissue, making it impossible for the electrodes to communicate with brain activity. So while the initial implantation can diminish symptoms, after a few short years or even months, the efficacy of this therapy begins to wane.
Now Aryeh Taub of Tel Aviv University's School of Psychological Sciences, along with Prof. Matti Mintz, Roni Hogri and Ari Magal of TAU's School of Psychological Sciences and Prof. Yosi Shacham-Diamand of TAU's School of Electrical Engineering, has developed a bioactive coating which not only "camouflages" the electrodes in the brain tissue, but actively suppresses the brain's immune response. By using a protein called an "interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist" to coat the electrodes, the multi-disciplinary team of researchers has found a potential resolution to turn a method for short-term relief into a long-term solution. This development was reported in the Journal of Biomedical Materials Research.
Limiting the immune response
To overcome the creation of the barrier between the tissue and the electrode, the researchers sought to develop a method for placing the electrode in the brain tissue while hiding the electrode from the brain's immune defenses. Previous research groups have coated the electrodes with various proteins, says Taub, but the TAU team decided to take a different approach by using a protein that is active within the brain itself, thereby suppressing the immune reaction against the electrodes.
In the brain, the IL-1 receptor antagonist is crucial for maintaining physical stability by localizing brain damage, Taub explains. For example, if a person is hit on the head, this protein works to create scarring in specific areas instead of allowing global brain scarring. In other words, it stops the immune system from overreacting. The team's coating, the first to be developed from this particular protein, not only integrates the electrodes into the brain tissue, but allows them to contribute to normal brain functioning.
In pre-clinical studies with animal models, the researchers found that their coated electrodes perform better than both non-coated and "naïve protein"-coated electrodes that had previously been examined. Measuring the number of damaged cells at the site of implantation, researchers found no apparent difference between the site of electrode implantation and healthy brain tissue elsewhere, Taub says. In addition, evidence suggests that the coated electrodes will be able to function for long periods of time, providing a more stable and long-term treatment option.
Restoring brain function
Approximately 30,000 people worldwide are currently using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat neurological or psychological conditions. And DBS is only the beginning. Taub believes that, in the future, an interface with the ability to restore behavioral or motor function lost due to tissue damage is achievable — especially with the help of their new electrode coating.
"We duplicate the function of brain tissue onto a silicon chip and transfer it back to the brain," Taub says, explaining that the electrodes will pick up brain waves and transfer these directly to the chip. "The chip then does the computation that would have been done in the damaged tissue, and feeds the information back into the brain — prompting functions that would have otherwise gotten lost."

Swifts Return to the Holy City
Monday, April 16, 2012
TAU researcher hosts ceremony to welcome migrating swifts back to Western Wall nesting site
Alongside the notes and prayers lodged in its ancient crevices, the Western Wall in Jerusalem has also long been home to the migrating swift, a highly aerial bird similar to swallows that can fly at an average speed of 30 miles an hour. According to Dr. Yossi Leshem of Tel Aviv University's Department of Zoology and Israel's foremost ornithologist, this holy site is one of the birds' oldest nesting colonies. In recent years, approximately 40 pairs of birds have been spotted nesting among the 2,000-year-old stones.
In a recent ceremony attended by Dr. Leshem and Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, the swifts were welcomed back to their nesting site from their winter home in Africa. Dr. Leshem hopes to make the swift's annual pilgrimage a draw for bird lovers from all over the globe.
During their 100-day nesting period, these master aerialists fly high above the city, eating, sleeping, and even mating in the air. The swifts, which weigh in at a tiny 1.2-1.6 ounces apiece, arrive in mid-February and return to Africa in June.
TAU, along with the Friends of the Swifts Association and the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, are working to protect the swifts, who prefer to nest in man-made structures. The organizations hope to safeguard current nesting sites and build additional sites.
"Ever since humans started building cities, the common swift has found our buildings perfect for nesting sites, including ancient holy sites such as churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples, and has become dependent on us," says Dr. Leshem. To preserve this habitat, the birds' 88 nesting sites have been taken into account during work to strengthen the masonry of the Western Wall.
For the full story on the returning swifts, see the Jerusalem Post story:

TAU Researcher Says Plants Can See, Smell, Feel, and Taste
Monday, July 30, 2012
Unlocking the secrets of plant genetics could lead to breakthroughs in cancer research and food security
Increasingly, scientists are uncovering surprising biological connections between humans and other forms of life. Now a Tel Aviv University researcher has revealed that plant and human biology is much closer than has ever been understood — and the study of these similarities could uncover the biological basis of diseases like cancer as well as other "animal" behaviors. have "senses" such as sight, smell, touch, and taste.
Ultimately, he adds, if we share so much of our genetic makeup with plants, we have to reconsider what characterizes us as human.
These findings could prompt scientists to rethink what they know about biology, says Prof. Chamovitz, pointing out that plants serve as an excellent model for experiments on a cellular level. This research is also crucial to food security, he adds, noting that knowledge about plant genetics and how plants sense and respond to their environment is central to ensuring a sufficient food supply for the growing population — one of the main goals of the Manna Center.
Seeing the light
Prof. Daniel Chamovitz
One of the most intriguing discoveries of recent years is that a group of plant genes used to regulate responses to light is also part of the human DNA. These affect responses like the circadian rhythm, the immune system, and cell division.
A plant geneticist, Prof. Chamovitz was researching the way plants react to light when he discovered an group of genes that were responsible for a plant "knowing" whether it was in the light or in the dark. He first believed that these genes were specific to plant life, but was surprised to later identify the same group of genes in humans and animals.
"The same group of proteins that plants use to decide if they are in the light or dark is also used by animals and humans," Prof. Chamovitz says. "For example, these proteins control two seemingly separate processes. First, they control the circadian rhythm, the biological clock that helps our bodies keep a 24 hour schedule. Second, they control the cell cycle — which means we can learn more about mutations in these genes that lead to cancer." In experiments with fruit flies who had a mutated version of one of these genes, Prof. Chamovitz and his fellow researchers observed that the flies not only developed a fly form of leukemia, but also that their circadian rhythm was disrupted, leading to a condition somewhat like permanent jet-lag.
Plants use light as a behavioral signal, letting them know when to open their leaves to gather necessary nutrients. This response to light can be viewed as a rudimentary form of sight, contends Prof. Chamovitz, noting that the plants "see" light signals, including color, direction, and intensity, then integrate this information and decide on a response. And plants do all this without the benefit of a nervous system.
And that's not the limit of plant "senses." Plants also demonstrate smell — a ripe fruit releases a "ripening pheromone" in the air, which is detected by unripe fruit and signals them to follow suit — as well as the ability to feel and taste. To some degree, plants also have different forms of "memory," allowing them to encode, store, and retrieve information.
Just like us
Beyond the genes that regulate responses to light, plants and humans share a bevy of other proteins and genes — for example, the genes that cause cystic fibrosis and breast cancer. Plants might not come down with these diseases, but the biological basis is the same, says Prof. Chamovitz. Because of this, plants are an excellent first stop when looking for a biological model, and could replace or at least enhance animal models for human disease in some types of research.
He is working alongside Prof. Yossi Shiloh, Israel Prize winner and incumbent of the David and Inez Myers Chair of Cancer Genetics at Tel Aviv University

We all work hard to protect our valuables. We buy insurance policies to protect our homes from theft or fire and we invest in safes to store jewelry, old coins and birth certificates. Despite this, most of us are not working hard enough to protect one of the most valuable things we own – our good name.
Identity theft is on the rise nationwide and is helped along by lenders and creditors who are willing to grant thousands of dollars in credit in mere minutes with little or no proof of identity. In today’s electronic age, an ID thief can easily, and sometimes legally, tap into your personal information with just a click of the computer mouse. A few bits of personal data are a gold mine for information crooks looking to steal your identity. An impostor using personal information like your address, birthdate, Social Security or credit card number, can acquire phony credit cards, private phone lines, siphon money from your checking or savings account, get a mortgage and even give you a criminal record.
Identity thieves may rummage through trash searching for discarded account statements, pre-approved credit card offers or credit receipts, search public records for your address, and even rob your mailbox. It may take a few months, but eventually you’ll start getting calls from creditors demanding payment for charges that you never made. A strange bank may call you about an overdrawn account in your name – an account you never opened. Identity theft takes months for you to detect, and sometimes years or longer to unravel.
This booklet will help you guard your privacy, protect your personal information and avoid identity fraud.
Chapter 1: What is Personal Information and Identity Theft?
The Personal Information Trade
When we wonder or worry about who might be snooping in our private affairs, we often think about the government, “Big Brother,” watching our homes, telephone calls, or travels; however, today there is another threat to our privacy in the network of commercial databases that keep personal information about each one of us.
Personalization
The sale, collection, and integration of personal information about consumers are new industries in the information age. There are currently over 1,000 private companies keeping comprehensive databases about individual consumers, a ten-fold increase in just five years.
These companies do not engage in the “mass marketing” of products or the researching of general demographic groups. Rather, they focus on gathering as much information as possible about specific people to engage in what is sometimes called “personalization” or “personal marketing.” Technology now allows these businesses to cheaply gather information about consumers, and then sort and categorize the data, sometimes called “data mining,” to isolate specific people for “target marketing” purposes.
Personal Information
The information possessed by these companies goes far beyond mere demographic data. For example, a privacy lawsuit against a marketing company revealed the types of information contained in its database. Its computer files contained more than 900 tidbits of information on individual consumers dating back more than a decade. One individual’s file was reportedly 25 single-spaced pages and contained information such as her income, marital status, hobbies, medical ailments, her preferred brand of antacid tablets, whether she had dentures, and how often she had used room deodorizers, sleeping aids, and hemorrhoid remedies.
The array of information available is limited only by the technology itself. Each electronically recorded transaction – from your use of credit, debit or ATM cards to your payment of mortgage or student loans – provides a glimpse into your private life. When layered on top of one another, these pieces of information create a complete picture of you as an individual.
Here are a few examples of the personal information trade:
One company maintains a database that operates twenty-four hours a day, gathering and processing information on 95% of American households. For a price, it will sort information based on income, lifestyle (outdoor, mechanic, intelligence, etc.), or even a profile of “ethnics who may speak their native language but do not think in that manner.”
Another company offers lists of people with particular medical conditions. In 1999, it offered for sale nearly 50 lists of individuals suffering from different medical ailments. It sells the names and addresses of 427, 000 people who are clinically depressed, 1.4 million women who have yeast infections, and 1 million individuals who have diabetes. It also sells lists of people with Alzheimer’s Disease, birth defects, Parkinson’s Disease, and “physical handicaps.”
A New York company offers the names of high school students according to GPA, religion, ethnicity, and SAT scores.
A hospital sells the names of its patients who may be eligible for social security insurance to a lawyer.
No information appears to be too personal for companies to collect or too insignificant to sell. In 1999, electronic research companies were selling unlisted phone numbers for $49, social security numbers for $49, and bank balances for $45. A company will obtain another person’s driving record for $35, trace a cell phone call for $84, or create a list of stocks, bonds, and securities for $209. This personal data is merged into a consumer tracking and information system that becomes larger every day it is sold to whomever may be interested in buying. Each piece of information gathered, stored, and sorted by these large databases represents an erosion of your right to privacy.
The personal information trade also enables a special kind of telemarketing called pre-acquired account telemarketing. Pre-acquired account telemarketing occurs when a telemarketer calls you with the ability to charge your credit card or bank account already in their hand. Unlike most telemarketers, these companies have acquired the ability to charge your account for the product that they are selling before they call you. A typical telemarketing sale, not involving pre-acquired accounts, requires that you provide a credit card or other account number to the telemarketer, or that you send a check or sign a contract in a later transaction. Providing a signature or an account number – like paying cash – is a readily recognizable way for you, as the buyer, to give your consent or assent to a deal.
Pre-acquired account telemarketing removes these short-hand methods for you to control when you have agreed to a purchase. Instead, the telemarketer controls the method by which you provide “consent” to the transaction, making the determination whether you have actually consented to the deal. This puts the telemarketer in a privileged position, such that he or she can charge your bank account or credit card in situations where you would never have voluntarily provided your account number to the caller.
Identity Theft
Identity theft occurs in a variety of ways and has different labels. Two key variations are commonly referred to by law enforcement as “true name” or “true party” frauds and “account takeover” frauds. With “true name” or “true party” fraud, the thief pretends to be you. The thief uses pieces of your identity to obtain new credit cards from banks and retailers, open checking and savings accounts, apply for loans, establish accounts with utility companies, or rent an apartment. The thief can ultimately ring up a tab worth thousands of dollars – all in your name. In an “account takeover” fraud, the thief steals your money and/or assets. The thief obtains enough personal information about you to gain access to existing credit or bank accounts. Thieves impersonating you contact creditors and banks to order additional cards on the account and have the cards sent to their address instead of yours. The thief may also file a change of address with the postal service to divert any newly ordered credit cards or checks into his or her hands.
Identity theft is usually more complex than an ordinary case of credit card fraud. Armed with just one or two pieces of identifying information, such as your birth date or address, a thief can assume your financial identity, access your existing accounts, and obtain a wide range of services and benefits in your name.
Identity Thieves
Interviews with victims of identity theft and experts have revealed a wide range of thief profiles. Thieves may be friends, relatives, co-workers, employees at companies or organizations with personal information about you in their databanks, and, worst of all, total strangers, who gain access to your personal information through any number of means.
Victims of Identity Theft
Creditworthy consumers with high incomes are the preferred prey of identity thieves, but almost any of us is a potential victim. It is impossible for you to totally eliminate the possibility of falling prey to identity fraud. To lessen the chance of becoming a victim keep a tight rein on your personal information, get off telemarketing lists, stop businesses from sharing your private information, dispose of sensitive documents safely, and closely monitor your finances.
Legal Protections Against Identity Theft>
Under Minnesota and federal law, a person who knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses an identity that is not the person’s own, with the intent to commit, aid, or abet any unlawful activity, is guilty of felony identity theft. In Minnesota, the maximum prison term and/or fine for violating the identity theft statute varies depending on the number and type of victims and amount of money stolen. Though laws exist to help prosecute identity theft, prevention is better.
The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes procedures for correcting mistakes on your credit report and requires that your record only be provided for legitimate business purposes.
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act prohibits debt collectors from using unfair or deceptive practices to collect overdue bills that your creditor has forwarded for collection.
The Fair Credit Billing Act establishes procedures for resolving billing errors on your credit card accounts. The act provides the most important protection for victims of identity theft. If you notify your card issuer at the address given for “billing inquiries” within 60 days after you receive a bill with an error, the act allows you to dispute the erroneous charge.
The Truth in Lending Act limits your liability for unauthorized credit card charges on lost or stolen cards to $50 per account. If you notify your card issuer before the thief’s unauthorized use, your liability will be $0. Therefore, if a company tries to sell you a credit card “protection” against unauthorized charges, you don’t need it. The federal law already protects you from significant monetary liability.
The Electronic Funds Transfer Act provides protection for all transactions using your debit card or other electronic means to debit or credit an account. It also limits your liability to $500 for unauthorized electronic fund transfers.
Your Personal Information Is Not As Safe As You Think
Today, personal financial information is widely accessible through a variety of sources.
Identity thieves legally obtain much of the information they need. Often, additional
information is obtained illegally, but at low risk and low cost.
Credit Bureaus
The three major credit bureaus – Experian, Equifax and Trans Union – and other credit reporting agencies, produce hundreds of millions of credit reports each year. The reports include a wealth of personal information about you including your date of birth, addresses, social security number, credit account information, public records and employment data.
Credit reports are easy for unauthorized people to get. All a thief needs is your name, Social Security number and a current or previous address. Credit bureaus, to their credit, only send reports to the current address displayed on the report. However, thieves anticipate this move by sending a creditor a pre-approved credit offer using your name and the thief’s address. The credit reporting system is designed to automatically update your file, so the report is sent to the thief instead of you. The thief then has all the information they need to steal your identity
Easy Access to Credit
In the United States today credit is easier to obtain than ever. We expect quick loans, which enable us to grab a surprise bargain or finance an emergency. Easy credit makes for easy crime. The credit approval process often amounts to little more than matching two bits of information on an application – a name and a Social Security number – with a credit report.
Social Security Numbers as Universal Identifiers
When social security numbers were first issued in 1936, the federal government assured the public that use of the numbers would be limited to Social Security programs. Today, however, the social security number is the most frequently used record keeping number in the United States. Social security numbers are used for employee files, medical records, health insurance accounts, credit and banking accounts, university ID cards, and many other purposes. In fact, a social security number is now required for dependents over one year of age.
Computer records have replaced paper filing systems in most organizations. Since more than one person may share the same name, accurate retrieval of information works best if each file is assigned a unique number. Many businesses and governmental agencies believe the social security number is tailor-made for this purpose. Because your social security number is frequently used as your identification number in business and government computer databases, information about you in one database is easily linked to other databases that contain different types of private information. Using your social security number as a universal identifier makes it possible for identity thieves to gain a more complete picture of your financial records and personal information.
Private Information Check List
What Is a Credit Bureau?
A credit bureau is a clearinghouse for credit history information. Creditors provide the bureaus with information about how their customers pay their bills. The bureaus assemble this information, along with public record information obtained from courthouses around the country. Then they turn this data into a “file” on each consumer. In return, creditors can obtain credit reports about consumers who wish to open accounts with their business or organization.
There are more than 1,000 local and regional credit bureaus throughout the United States. Most credit bureaus are either owned by, or are under contract with, one of the nation’s three major credit card bureaus – Experian, Trans Union and Equifax. These national agencies maintain centralized databases containing the credit records of more than 170 million Americans. Credit bureaus generate more than a half billion reports per year.
What Is In a Credit Report?
Credit reports are a gold mine of information about you. The report contains your name, Social Security number, address, credit payment status and employment history. A credit report also contains legal information including liens, bankruptcy and other matters of public record. Federal and state laws restrict who has access to your sensitive information and how it can be used. Anyone with a “legitimate business purpose” can gain access to your credit history, including: those considering granting you credit, landlords, insurance companies, employers and potential employers, and companies with which you have a credit account.
Certain pieces of information cannot be included in your credit report:
Medical information (unless you give your consent).
Negative information, including a bankruptcy that is more than 10 years old.
Debts that are more than seven years old. Information about your age, marital status, or race cannot be included in your report if requested by a prospective employer.
Experts recommend looking at your credit report every year and before making a major purchase. Every year consumers can get a free credit report from each of the credit agencies — Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. The credit bureaus have created a centralized website, toll-free telephone number and mailing address for Minnesota consumers to order their reports. Annual reports may be requested the following way:
- Logging on to:
- Calling: 1-877-322-8228
- Writing: Annual Credit Report Request Service
P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA., 30348-5281
If you have already received your free annual credit report, Minnesota law allows you to purchase another credit report once a year for $3 from each of the credit bureaus, separately. You are entitled to one free copy of your report each year if (1) you’re unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days, (2) you’re on welfare, or (3) your report is inaccurate because of fraud. In addition there is no charge for the report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance or employment, and you request your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. You may use the Credit File Request Form, located on page 23 of this booklet to order your credit report. To do so, contact one or more of the three national credit bureaus:

What Is Your Social Security Statement?
Your Social Security Statement provides both a statement of past earnings and an estimate of future benefits you will receive from Social Security. The statement shows how much you’ve paid into Social Security over your working years. The statement also shows how much you can expect to receive when you retire or if you become disabled. You can also determine from the statement how much your family is entitled to receive if you die. The Social Security Administration recommends that you check your Social Security earnings at least once every three years. After that it becomes more difficult to trace the earnings. A Social Security Statement is available upon request. To get a statement, call the Social Security Administration’s toll-free number at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778).
What Is on My Driving Record?
Driver and Vehicle Services, a division of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, keeps records on drivers (such as driver license and driver history information), and about vehicles (such as ownership information). Information stored about you includes your name, address, social security number, physical description (height, weight, eye color), date of birth, status of your driver’s license, whether corrective lenses are needed for driving, and if you are an organ donor. In addition, a record is kept of any moving violations that you are convicted of, and whether you have medical conditions that may affect driving.
Who Can Get the Information in My Driving Record?
The Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) enforcers, for use by insurers to investigate claims or fraud, for use by an employer to verify that you have a commercial driver’s license, or for use in legal proceedings.
Most of the remaining data in your driving record is less protected. That data can be released without your consent not only to government agencies, insurers, employers and in legal proceedings for the purposes above, but also to:
Auto manufacturers, for uses related to auto safety, theft, emissions, alterations, recalls, advisories, market research, and performance monitoring;
Legitimate businesses, but only in the normal course of business to verify the accuracy of personal information you submitted so as to prevent fraud or recover a debt;
Researchers, to publish statistical reports that do not identify individuals;
Towing companies, to notify owners of towed or impounded autos;
Toll companies, to operate private toll transportation facilities (if Minnesota had such facilities)
Licensed private investigators or security services, for any of these purposes; or
Any person who has obtained your written consent.
However, if a person or business requests your driving record for a purpose other than one permitted above (by federal law), then DPS will not release your driving record unless you have expressly consented by checking a box on your license or ownership application renewal. Thus, without your consent, no commercial or business firms can access your record to add your name to direct-mail, telemarketing, or survey list.
What Is in My Medical Information Report?, medications prescribed, and the results of surgery and other medical procedures.
A wide range of people, in and out of the health care industry, may access your medical information. Generally, access to your records is obtained when you agree to let others see them. You probably signed a blanket waiver or general consent form at some point when you obtained medical care. When you sign such a waiver, you allow the health care provider to release your medical information to insurance companies, government agencies and others.
The Medical Information Bureau (MIB) is an organization that compiles a central database of medical information. Approximately 15 million Americans and Canadians are on file in the MIBs computers. More than 750 insurance firms use the services of the MIB, primarily to obtain information about life insurance and individual health insurance policy applicants. You are entitled to a free medical record disclosure once a year. You can get a copy by calling the Medical Information Bureau toll-free at: 1-866-692-6901. For other questions or to correct your report, write to:
Medical Information Bureau
P.O. Box 105
Essex Stations
Boston, MA 02112
Phone: (617) 426-3660
Businesses and Other Organizations With Information About You
It is not just the government or creditors that collect and distribute information about you and your buying practices. Banks, insurance companies, charities and others have personal information about you that you may not want other people to know. You should compile a list of the businesses and organizations that have information about you. When forming new relationships with an organization or company, ask what will be done with your information and who will have access to it. Information is power in our society. Knowing who has what information about you allows you some control over how that information is used. Don’t hesitate to let companies and organizations know you expect them to respect your privacy.
Sale of Personal Information by State and Local Governments
Public records containing personal information such as homeowners’ documents, police and court records, utility records, and marriage and divorce records have always been available for sale in paper form. With the growing use of computer databases and the Internet, however, it is easier than ever to obtain these records for fraudulent use without leaving behind a paper trail. Public databases can now be accessed directly from many government computers and through commercial database vendors.
Identity thieves range from old-fashioned pickpockets to sophisticated theft rings with equipment that can re-encode the magnetic strip on the back of counterfeit or stolen credit cards. In an effort to compile personal information, identity theft rings sometimes enlist cleaning people (who retrieve data from office wastebaskets), corrupt merchants (who sell credit card sales receipts), and employees of financial institutions and brokerage firms who process financial transactions.

The ability to store and retrieve natural gas increases the reliability of gas service. Access to storage allows individual gas buyers to acquire lower-cost supplies on the spot market during off-peak periods(such as the summer months) and store the gas in locations near end-users during periods of peak demand (such as the winter months). Storage can also compensate for temporary disruptions in natural gas production. Natural gas can be stored underground in several types of facilities, including salt caverns, depleted aquifers, and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. On average, 15–20 percent of natural gas consumed during the five-month winter heating season comes from underground storage. On a given winter day, 50 percent or more of gas supplied to customers may come from underground storage. As significant holders of storage capacity, natural gas utilities are changing the way they use the supply asset, and continue to improve their storage practices to be more competitive. For example, many utilities use financial tools to hedge summer injections and minimize storage refill costs. In addition, storage capacity is increasingly viewed as an asset that requires critical economic management in order to maximize its value.
Approximately 420 natural gas storage fields operate in the United States. Underground storage is a critical link to supplying consumers with reliable, affordable natural gas, particularly during periods of peak demand. Underground storage also links critical new infrastructure development, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, to natural gas customers. It acts as a repository of supply between the times gas is imported and when it is required for consumption. AGA supports the market based growth of this key gas infrastructure.

Tanga Cement blames “unreliable” rail transport for high cement prices
May, 31 2012
(Tanzania) -- Tanga Cement's managing director Erik Westerberg has blamed the unreliable rail transport in the country for causing an escalation in cement prices in the country.
“We are relying on road transport to move our products which is very costly,” Mr Westerberg said.
“If we were to use rail transport it would reduce the costs of production thereby reduce the final prices," he added.
He added that if the cement companies relied on rail transport, the prices of cement in the country would drop. Cement is currently being sold at a price of $9.61 a bag.
"There is unreliable rail transport in the country. The increase in the costs of our products is partly due to poor infrastructure," Westerberg said.
He also blamed the high taxes and infrastructure costs for the high prices of cement across the country.
"We usually pay a lot of taxes which the government reinstated in 2005 while at the same time, we face an acute shortage of power where about 30% of the total electricity required to run the company depends on the company's own production. Partly, this are some of the reasons for the high cement prices," Westerberg said.
Last week the company said it would build a second kiln to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2015.

ANTHEM - Mountain Pointe emerged from a sloppy first half of play to upset No. 14 Boulder Creek 43-36 in a first-round matchup in the Division I state tournament on Wednesday.
While an abundance of turnovers factored into the play of both teams, the defensive effort from No. 19 Pride was the main reason the team will be advancing in the playoffs.
After the Jaguars beat Mountain Pointe 54-47 in the first round of the Division I, Section III tournament last week, Pride coach Trevor Neider knew defense would be the key to returning the favor.
Defensively, Mountain Pointe came ready to play.
"I just thought defensively we played 100 percent better," Neider said. "We didn't shoot much better, but we played defense so we didn't have to shoot as well."
The Pride (22-9) had a total of 13 steals, eight of which came from junior Ashley Clubb and sophomore Kaylah Lupoe, both of whom missed time in the first meeting because of illness.
No steal was bigger than Caitlyn Hetrick's in the fourth quarter, though. After scoring, Hetrick got in front of the Boulder Creek in-bounds pass and put it up for another quick two points, contributing to her team's decisive nine-point run.
To go along with the steal, Hetrick finished with 11 points, three rebounds and three assists.
After only playing about five minutes in last week's matchup, the 6-foot-1 Lupoe was given the assignment of covering junior Sam Young, at 6 feet 3 inches, of the Jaguars.
Lupoe more than completed that assignment, finishing with a triple-double of 10 points, 12 rebounds, four steals and 10 blocks. Most of her blocks came while playing blanket defense on Young, which caused Boulder Creek to go elsewhere with the ball.
Young still managed to score nine points and bring down nine rebounds, but the damage could have been worse.
"Sitting there, I watched (last week's game) and I saw what I needed to do, so I came in this game and played good defense," Lupoe said. "I needed to shut (Young) down because that would give us a chance."
Disorganized play by both sides marred the first quarter. Boulder Creek (23-7) began trapping on defense early in the second quarter, which allowed the team to take advantage of the Pride's mistakes and end the half on an eight-point run with a 20-15 lead.
Mountain Pointe's biggest mistakes came on the simplest of techniques: dribbling. Traveling violations kept the Pride from getting much of an offensive rhythm going through the first two quarters.
"I think it's just a focus thing," Neider said. "We catch it and we just go out of control. That's something we've talked about all year and we work on it every day."
Despite the first-half mistakes, Mountain Pointe came out of halftime a different team, reenergized and confident.
"Halftime we just said if we play defense (and) if we hold them under 40, I said I'd be more than happy with that," Neider said. "At some point, we've got to make something. Luckily, we did."
The Pride move on to face No. 3 Saint Mary's, the top-ranked team in the nation, on the road on Friday.
"It's an honor that we get to play them," Lupoe said. "We're really happy and we're really pumped. Hopefully we have a good game."

It's OK Thursday #16
Hey, hey, it's ok!
...to indulge in some M&M's now, knowing that you plan to make up for your lack of exercise next week during break.
...to opt to go to bed early, rather than staying up to accomplish more.
...to take advantage of a free meal and drag the whole family out. School/community Thanksgiving dinner in the cafeteria tonight? Heck yes we'll be in attendance!
...to be excited that a student has promised to bake a peanut butter pie for class tomorrow.
...to be saddened by the loss of a favorite student to a PCS. Damn you Fort Hood!
...to be more excited about Thanksgiving break than the kids.
...to finally buy those cold weather, long length running tights because there was a 25% off sale.
...to spending working hours thinking about a Christmas card photo. Not sure what DH and I are going to do, although we've talked about both being in uniform (ABUs and ACUs). PDA-laden photos are out of the question, per regulation. I think we'll be left with "loving looks" and regular smiles. :) I'm thinking outdoors, although I'm not sure if we want the background to be a field setting or if we should take a picture in front of the planes on base. We'll see!

Long Wait Over for Snecma Silvercrest.
According to Snecma, the Silvercrest will burn 15 percent less fuel, emit 50 percent less nitrous oxide (NOx) than the CAEP/6 standard and halve the noise footprint “compared to existing engines in the 10,000- to 12,000-pound class.”
The contract with Cessna was signed just a few days ago, Pierre Fabre, Snecma’s chairman and CEO, told an EBACE show press conference. Has his company signed a contract with another business jet manufacturer for the Silvercrest yet? “The only contract we can talk about today is the Cessna one,” replied Fabre. Another hint was he would not say when Silvercrest production begins. The Silvercrest has long been rumored to be selected for the still-under-wraps Dassault Falcon SMS super-midsized jet, which expected to be unveiled next year.
Two Silvercrest engines will provide 11,000 pounds of thrust each on the Longitude. Snecma has started running the engine core, and the first full engine is due to go to test this summer at its Villaroche factory near Paris, which also produces large numbers of CFM International engines for Airbus and Boeing airliners.
Flight testing of the engine is due to start in the first half of 2013 using a Gulfstream GII (see box) and engine certification is pegged for 2015. Eight engines will take part to the certification effort, said Laurence Finet, the program’s general manager. The first engine is now being assembled after full-scale engine development started in the third quarter of 2010.
The Silvercrest’s cold section is made of a 42.5-inch. The bypass ratio is close to 6:1, Finet added.
In terms of maintenance, Snecma emphasizes the Silvercrest is a “true on-condition engine,” with no fixed interval. No hot-section inspection will be required. Another feature will be in-flight engine monitoring capability.
As the flying testbed for the Silvercrest will be a Gulfstream GII, what about re-engining the venerable business jet? “Why not? We are studying all possibilities,” Laurence Finet, Silvercrest program general manager, told AIN. During the flight tests, the GII will have one of its Rolls-Royce Speys replaced with a Silvercrest. Snecma obtained the GII from sister company Sagem, which had been using it as a testbed for avionics upgrades but no longer needed it.

Does Air China's frequent flier program cooperates with any other FFP - i.e. miles flown with CA, can they be used for any other mayor program (any Star or OneWorld program). I was not able to find this information from their website. This part was in Chinese only
Lufthansa (and soon United) frequent flyers can earn miles on Air China- that's it.[Edited 2003-09-22 18:53:51]
Air China was a Northwest Airlines partner but that agreement just ended this past summer. Here's the details from:
Earning/Redeeming Miles*
Air China operated flights between San Francisco/Los Angeles and Beijing/Shanghai, and codeshare connections from Beijing to Chengdu, Ghangzhou, Qinghao, Shenyang, Xiamen, and Xi'an.
Mileage/Class Bonus
500 miles minimum or actual mileage flown.
50% mileage bonus for purchased Business Class or First Class travel.
Destinations
Air China serves more than 68 cities in China, as well as destinations throughout Asia, Australia, the Middle East and Europe.
*As of June 30, 2003, Air China will no longer be a WorldPerks partner. WorldPerks members may accrue miles on applicable Air China flights through June 30, 2003. Award redemptions on applicable Air China flights must be booked and ticketed by June 30, 2003 for travel to be completed by June 30, 2004. Lounge reciprocity will also be discontinued on June 30, 2003."

Hey guys,
I monitor flightaware quite often and seem to notice that the 747-200 (although quite rare) seems to always be the fastest airliner on there, often pushing a ground speed of 780mph!
I monitor the Northeast Region of the USA, watching planes heading east towards Europe. I know planes heading in this direction have a higher ground speed due to the winds, but why is it that at any given time, if there's a 747-200 (usually with Kalitta Air) in this area, it's always going QUITE faster than anything on the same route.
Just to make sure i wasn't crazy, i tracked many 747-400 Cargo flights traveling the same routes and they never seem to reach speeds as high as when the flights are operated by a 747-200.
Is there something about the 747-200 that makes it faster than the 747-400 counterpart? Is a ground speed of 780mph normal for this plane? I swear, when there's a 747-200 in flight, there isn't a single plane around it reaching the same speed.
Thanks for the input!

Sending Natural Gas Abroad.
The main opposition comes from chemical and fertilizer companies that are big users of natural gas, and from consumers who fear higher prices. With more gas headed to foreign shores, domestic supplies of the fuel are expected to fall, driving up its price. But prices would still be well below their 2008 levels, and they would rise only gradually, over the course of several years.
A second objection comes mainly from some environmental groups that regard fracturing, the technique used to extract gas from deep shale formations, as environmentally dangerous. These concerns are best addressed by much tighter regulation of gas production, not by restricting exports..

TUSCALOOSA, Alabama – The experts have spoken, and they’ll continue to speak right up until kickoff time Monday.
The authorities on a BCS Championship Game that has the college football world buzzing include three coaches who have won national championships at Alabama or Notre Dame.
Former Alabama coaches present a strong case for the Crimson Tide, a 9½-point favorite. Former Notre Dame coaches make more of a lukewarm case for the Fighting Irish, which is 5-1 against Alabama.
Gene Stallings, who coached Alabama to the 1992 national championship, picks the Tide to win 24-7. Ray Perkins, who coached Alabama to its only victory over Notre Dame in 1986, picks the Tide to win by two or three touchdowns. Bill Oliver, who suffered through three losses to Notre Dame in the 1970s as an assistant coach under Paul Bryant and later assisted Stallings, sees Alabama winning by as many as three touchdowns.
Ara Parseghian, who coached Notre Dame to two national championships (1966 and ’73) and two victories over Alabama (1973 and ’74), laughs when asked if he has a prediction, then punts.
Lou Holtz, who coached Notre Dame to its most recent national championship in 1988, picks the Fighting Irish to win but stops short of predicting a score or margin.
PICK ALABAMA
• Mark May, ESPN: “When you look at the meat-grinder schedule they (Alabama) played in the best conference – without a doubt, nobody will argue – the SEC. … Notre Dame hasn’t played in a championship game since Moby Dick was a minnow. They don’t know how to play under that pressure. … The SEC has won six championships in a row. They (Alabama) know how to win championships. Notre Dame does not.”
• Stewart Mandel, Sports Illustrated: “Both teams will struggle to run the ball against the other's front seven. Irish quarterback Everett Golson may be able to pick on the Tide's secondary early, but Nick Saban's team will eventually adjust. Meanwhile, after relying heavily on his tight ends, Alabama's AJ McCarron will eventually connect deep down the sideline with wideout Amari Cooper for a couple of game-changing plays.” Score: Alabama 17, Notre Dame 10
• Sporting News: .”
• WhatIfSports.com (computer simulation): “A defensive slugging match was busted open by two third-quarter runs from Alabama's T.J. Yeldon. The first, a 57-yarder, brought the Crimson Tide to within a point of Notre Dame. The second, from 40 yards out, secured another national championship for Alabama and the SEC.” Score: Alabama 16, Notre Dame 13 • EA Sports (computer simulation): Alabama 21, Notre Dame 20
• Sports Illustrated – Alabama 23, Notre Dame 16
• Graham Watson, Yahoo! Sports
• Yahoo! Users (71 percent pick Alabama)
• Dennis Dodd , CBSSports.com
• Seven USA Today pickers, including national writer George Schroeder
• ESPN.com
• Will Harris, ESPN.com (fantasy college football analyst): Alabama 17, Notre Dame 13
• Phil Steele, PhilSteele.com
• PhilSteele.com users (74 percent pick Alabama)
THEY ALSO
PICK NOTRE DAME
• Pat Forde, Yahoo! Sports
• Dan Wolken, USA Today
• Bruce Feldman, CBSSports.com
CBS analyst Gary Danielson expects Alabama to romp. Mark May, Holtz’s counterpart in an ESPN college football studio show, also likes the Tide.
And for what it’s worth, two computer-game simulations predict Alabama victories, but by close margins.
Here are some of the analyses and prognostications:
- Ara Parseghian (Notre Dame coach, 1964-74; 1966 and 1973 national championships): “It’s going to be a low-scoring game, because both of them have good defenses, and generally in championship games, teams play it a little closer to the vest. … You’ll see both teams attack the vulnerabilities that they see in film study. … I was surprised that Georgia ran well against Alabama. If Notre Dame can establish a running game, because stopping the run seems to be a strength of Alabama’s defense, the chances of winning are enhanced.” … Notre Dame QB Everett Golson “has improved dramatically since the start of the season. He started out slow. About midseason, you could see him get the confidence and handle the offense. His ability to handle the audibles are vastly improved.” Prediction: “Yeah, I have a prediction. I’m going to enjoy watching that game.”
- Gene Stallings (Alabama coach, 1990-96; 1992 national championship): “Alabama’s got the best football team. If they play to the best of their capabilities, they’ll win. The best football team doesn’t always win, but it wins most of the time. If Alabama can run the football the way they’ve been running it, and they can play defense the way they’ve been playing it, it’s going to be hard for Notre Dame to have a whole lot of success. The magnitude of the game, it’s not like Alabama hasn’t won a national championship in the last two or three years, but it’s the first time Notre Dame has played for a national championship in a while. Notre Dame is going to be pumped up as well as they can be. … Notre Dame is going to be thinking national championship. Alabama is going to be thinking it’s the next game on their schedule.” Prediction: Alabama 24, Notre Dame 7
- Lou Holtz (Notre Dame coach, 1986-96; 1988 national championship): “The fact that you have a quarterback that can run in Everett Golson … gives them problems. In Theo Riddick you have a young man who was a wide receiver for three years, now plays tailback. You have (tight end) Tyler Eifert, could have went to school on a basketball scholarship. You can split him out, throw the alley or three wide receivers because of what Theo Riddick is going to do. A lot of people don't think Notre Dame has a chance. They match up very, very well in this football game. If (coach) Brian Kelly is smart, he'll be able to do some different things that will surprise Alabama a little bit.” Prediction: On a Dec. 2 ESPN show, he picked the Fighting Irish but didn’t give a score or margin. “There’s something special about Notre Dame.”
- Ray Perkins (Alabama coach 1983-86; defeated Notre Dame 28-10 in 1986): “In spots, it’s going to be a pretty good game, but I don’t think Notre Dame has played a team quite like Alabama, meaning a team that is stronger than Alabama. They’ve got the power, the superior passing game, and they’ve got the best defense. … I saw a replay of the Notre Dame-USC game the other night. I wasn’t that impressed, to be honest with you. I was trying to get fired up about SC’s team, but I couldn’t do that, either. They’ve got a lot of good players, but I still think it comes down to, have they played one of the top-echelon teams in the country, a top 5, or top 6 or 7 team? I don’t think they have. To say they played an Alabama or an LSU or a Florida or Texas A&M, I don’t think they have. It could turn out totally different, because this game of football can be a little surprising sometimes. Even if Alabama has a little bit of an off game, I still think they win the game.” Prediction: “People down here (Hattiesburg, Miss.) ask me how I think it’ll turn out. I tell them I think we’ll win by two or three touchdowns.”
- Bill Oliver (Alabama assistant coach from 1971-79 under Paul Bryant and from 1990-95 under Gene Stallings): “I just think we’ve got more speed. We’ve got more people that have been there, and being there makes a lot of difference. The experienced quarterback should make a difference, and maturity with the offensive line. … Defensively, I think we match up well, even though they have some versions of the spread. All in all, we’ll have to earn everything we get. … Their front seven, technique-wise, is very good, but they have not played against an opponent like they’re fixing to face. That’s big.” Prediction: “We’ll beat the line, by far – maybe three touchdowns – but don’t ever, ever bet on what an ex-coach – or present-day coach – says.”
- Gary Danielson (CBS analyst): “Both teams are used to handling big games. Alabama has a superior team. They should win convincingly. They’re stronger, and they’re faster. They have more experience at quarterback. I don’t think Notre Dame will sneak up on them. They’ll be focused for the game. I’ll be surprised if it’s close. There is a way Notre Dame can make it a close game, and it’s a way that college football always seems to present itself. There is a star player on the field that probably in other sports would already be playing professionally, and that’s (tight end) Tyler Eifert. If he was a baseball, hockey or basketball player, he would already be in the professional ranks. Notre Dame could create a pressure point with him, much like Johnny Manziel did where his individual brilliance forced Alabama to react and morph their defense to stop him, and it produced openings on other places on the field. … In the big games this year, (Alabama QB) AJ McCarron has not played his best. I think he’s due a great game, like he played a year ago. … It’s very normal that teams that try to repeat talk after the process of how mentally drained they were during the middle of the season, the middle of the marathon. That’s what happened to Alabama. … They’ll be a very refreshed, ready team.” Prediction: Alabama 28, Notre Dame 10.

BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - Is the national championship at stake Saturday in Starkville? Will someone hand Gene Chizik or Dan Mullen a crystal football afterward to hoist above his head?
Um, no.
What about the SEC championship? Will the Tigers or the Bulldogs tote one of those giant cardboard conference logos around the stadium while confetti falls from the sky?
Oops. Wrong again, although there will be cowbells.
Is a state championship at least up for grabs?
Sorry. Each state has its own prize, and as everyone knows, the Iron Bowl crushes the Egg Bowl in terms of gravity.
Since Auburn actually has won a state, league and national title under Chizik, it’s simply unscientific to categorize the second start and conference opener of his fourth season as the most important game of his tenure.
For example, it’s mathematically possible that Auburn could lose to Mississippi State to fall to 0-2 and win the rest of the games on the schedule to finish the regular season 10-2. Not probable. Not likely on any planet inhabited by intelligent life. But possible.
OK. Now that the disclaimer’s been stated and the lawyers have left the room to grab some coffee, let’s get real.
This one’s big. Real big. As big as the second game of the season and the conference opener gets when you’re not projected to compete for the state, league or national titles. As Gene Stallings might say, if you don’t think this game is big, go ahead and lose it and see what happens.
That goes for Chizik and Mullen.
They’re an interesting pair. Their tenures began at the same time, and neither of them has earned tenure, but the scale between them is decidedly unbalanced.
Chizik is 3-0 in their head-to-head matchups, but two of the three games have come down to State having a final drive to tie or win the game. The Bulldogs failed on each occasion, once against one of the best teams in Auburn history, the other time against one of the most mediocre groups of Tigers.
Mullen wanted Cam Newton, having coached him as an assistant at Florida, but Chizik got him. As a result, the Auburn coach won state, SEC and BCS championships in 2010.
Chizik has that one monster season in the bank. Mullen has one good year on his resume. It’s hard to tell where either program is headed this season after Auburn opened with a tough, close loss to a quality opponent in Clemson and State began with an easy victory against overmatched Jackson State.
Auburn’s loss won’t sting as much if it beats State, and State’s win won’t mean a thing if it loses again to Auburn.
If Mullen falls to 0-4 against Chizik, it’ll be one more reminder that the Mississippi State coach hasn’t beaten anyone in the SEC West except woeful Ole Miss. That’ll be a good thing for Chizik, but if you’re Auburn, State isn’t a measuring stick. It’s a minimum yearly requirement. You beat State on what you hope is the way to bigger and better things.
You lose to State and, well, you don’t lose to State. Not without some explaining to do.
For Chizik, losing to Mississippi State for the first time after losing to Clemson for the second straight year would change the discussion from micro to macro, from his team to his program. The doubt that’s already crept into the minds of neutral observers and some Auburn supporters alike would only grow.
There are bigger games and better opponents ahead for the Tigers. For starters, see LSU in Auburn Sept. 22. There are revenge games all over the map for a team that lost five times last season, and there’s a state championship game at the end.
There is one serious question, though, staring Chizik and his team straight in the face this week. If they can’t beat Mississippi State, who are they going to beat?
For all of those reasons, Chizik is about to lead his team into the most important game he’s coached without Newton at quarterback. Because without Newton at quarterback, Chizik is 16-11.
That gap is too close for comfort. Things could get really uncomfortable if it narrows even more this weekend.

Book Review
Tom Zillner, Editor
Information Architecture for the World Wide Web
by Louis Rosenfeld and Peter Morville. Sebastopol, Calif.: O'Reilly, 1998. 202p. $29.95 (ISBN 1-56592-282-4).
Information Architecture, published in 1998, is a relatively old book. In Internet time, that's at least a couple of generations ago. I think it's worth attention because it's a classic volume that will help anyone interested in designing a Web site from the ground up or attempting to fix a Web site that is not as usable as it might be.
This is a book by librarians (although they've migrated into the field of information architecture) but it is not a book that is primarily for librarians. The language of the librarian creeps in a bit, most notably when the authors discuss controlled vocabulary, but the real meat is not masked by librarian-speak. Rosenfeld and Morville are subtler than that. They present important concepts that are familiar to librarians but couched in plain language that uses plenty of examples.
The book hits the ground running. Rosenfeld and Morville recommend that the people who will be building a Web site get together in what they call "Consumer Sensitivity Boot Camp," in which they air both the things they hate and like about the Web. Ultimately the goal is to produce lists of things that work and don't work and use this as a background for the actual design and production of the site.
The book then pulls back from an active start to describe the role of the information architect and some suggestions for who might take on this role. Because many people are unfamiliar with information architecture and architects, it is a good idea to provide some coverage of these terms as well as contrasting the role of the information architect with the roles of others on the design team. It's important to note that this book targets both the large commercial project where information architects might be part of an outside consulting firm and the smaller project consisting of just a few people and a miniscule budget.
Creating a Web site starts with determining an organization scheme. An example of a organization scheme is the alphabetical arrangement of a telephone book or the layout of a supermarket. These are two very different schemes, suggestive of the wide range of possibilities. It should ordinarily take some time to determine the best organization scheme or schemes for a Web site. A different but related task is looking at possible organization structures for the site. An example of an organization structure is the hierarchy, the most commonly used structure in site design. Other examples of Web site organization structure include hypertext, where there are "content chunks" connected via links. There are pros and cons to each structure and these are well covered by Rosenfeld and Morville. An interesting aspect of the discussion of organization structures is a seeming bias toward a relational database model. Although one can glean some of the benefits of such a model from the discussion of database implementation, it's not clear that the author's explication of this model provides a solid rationale for its use.
If this all sounds a bit complicated that's because it is, but it's important to have a grounding in organization schemes and structures before taking any further steps in the design process. The next step is to consider possible navigation systems to employ. Hierarchical navigation systems are the norm, starting out at a home screen and filing down to subsidiary pages through the use of top-level links. Rosenfeld and Morville point out that this sort of navigation is often of limited use and other navigation methods should be considered, such as global navigation, where it is possible on any given page to navigate via tools similar to navigation bars. Local navigation is the use of additional tools for a sub-site of the larger site and it is a complement, not a replacement, for global navigation.
The authors also address labeling systems. It really takes a librarian (or an information architect who has a librarian's training) to appreciate the importance of labeling systems. There are many species of labels within Web sites, but they should all be consistent and clear with each other and fit into a cohesive whole. While such a directive may sound vague and unclear, the authors do a good job of explaining the importance and application of labeling systems within a Web site. In this chapter, they discuss controlled vocabularies and thesauri and the value of their use in selecting appropriate labels. The authors even mention Library of Congress Subject Headings, although they point out that given its goal of describing "the universe of knowledge," the subject headings are wildly inappropriate for use as a thesaurus. The key is to find a narrowly focused thesaurus specific to the information the Web site will carry. Other types of tools to construct labeling systems are also covered. All in all, this chapter well deserves the twenty-five pages devoted to it.
Similarly, there is a comprehensive chapter on selecting indexing and searching systems. While most of us tend to throw in a search engine that's linked from any page and performs a simple search on the entire site, this isn't necessarily desirable. In fact, the chapter starts with a discussion of instances when you should not make your site searchable. Following are sections discussing searching behavior and search interface design. The important point of this chapter is that indexing and searching are not one-size-fits-all propositions; real work is required to determine how people will use your Web site and to construct a scheme that matches their behavior.
In these beginning chapters, which account for a good portion of the book, emphasis is placed on the foundation pieces of information architecture. The authors then move from these foundation pieces to actual practice. The first step in creating a Web site is research. It's important to stay with this process rather than leap into construction. This is a common mistake, particularly where budgets are small or where there is a rush to get "something" up, no matter how ill thought out that something might be.
Research must include face-to-face meetings. Other types of communication just don't work when discussing and working on an inherently visual medium. Rosenfeld and Morville recommend that the first item on the agenda for the first meeting be a critique of existing Web sites. This critique cannot effectively take place via phone or e-mail. What the participants say is partly a matter of consensus reached through exploration rather than just a yea or nay vote. The critique also is an ice-breaker, getting the members of the team better acquainted. If there is just one person responsible for the site, that one person should put together a team of people who have a vested interest in the site's content, whether they are colleagues in other departments of the same institution or users from outside the organization.
The meetings should include the definition of goals, intended audience, and content. All of this is easy enough to understand from most people's experience and the clear explication of the authors. Content inventory completes the first stage of the design and implementation process. This inventory is developed from wish lists and a setting of priorities regarding information to be included on the site.
The next steps in the process fall under the heading of conceptual design. As with the rest of the book, the reader may find these activities are covered in extensive detail, but as usual the devil is in the details. Rosenfeld and Morville discuss the respective merits of high-tech white boards that capture what's written for subsequent viewing and printout versus flip charts with a bit of levity. The authors' state, "We're guessing many of these gadgets are more trouble than they're worth. Sorry for the skepticism, but what do you expect from librarians?"
Metaphor exploration is also examined. I am skeptical of the heavy-handed use of metaphor in our computerized and netted life. The desktop metaphor is useful, but it's unclear if we will ever escape it to something that better suits our increasingly Internet-centric lives. Categories of metaphor are presented and one example provided is of the Internet Public Library's (IPL) reference center (). The center is graphically represented as a room in a library, with the friendly librarian behind a desk and books labeled with hotlinks to various subject areas. This mainly works well, but the addition of a link to a multi-user object oriented environment (MOO) results in a possibly jarring addition of a sign pointing to another room. Unlike the authors, I think this metaphor works just fine. But we've all seen plenty of cases where metaphor clutters a site with graphics. Judicious use of graphics in the service of a metaphor that assists the user in navigating the site is wonderful, but metaphor is easily abused.
Scenarios are presented as another part of the conceptual design process. They are simply descriptions of how various sorts of users would use the site. I say "simply," but the construction of realistic scenarios can be a daunting task. For one thing, if you don't have enough outsiders working with you to put together the site plan, it is very easy to make ill-conceived assumptions about users. Perhaps the most common tendency is to assume that users are very much like oneself, but other equally suspect assumptions may be made. This is the stage where relative outsiders may ask hard questions that result in a better set of working assumptions underlying scenarios.
One thing that Rosenfeld and Morville underemphasize is the involvement of users at some early point in the process of design and construction. Scenario building is a great place to begin user involvement, but even earlier is better. Users often traverse and utilize a site in ways never envisioned by architects and designers.
Next in the process are architectural blueprints. This is the point at which the information architect puts together a high-level diagram of the site. The high-level blueprint "shows pages, components within pages, groups of pages, and relationships between pages." Sounds more like a detailed blueprint, but that will be even more in depth and occurs at the last design stage. Prior to this the graphic designer comes forward with page design ideas leading to page prototypes and then templates. Both the high-level blueprints and the page design need to be approved by the committee formed at the project's beginning.
At the prototype stage the graphic designer comes to the fore and mounts pages for evaluation and critiquing. This is one of the first of the tangible "deliverables," and it can dazzle. As Rosenfeld and Morville suggest, this is a time when esthetics take center stage. But its important to look at the prototype with something of a jaundiced eye. The graphics can play an important role in complementing the content or they can overpower or confuse the user. It's best to use a graphic designer with Web experience instead of breaking in someone from the print world. It's also important to not spend an overly long time on this phase. I have been involved in a corporate identity project where weeks were spent getting interested parties to agree on a logo. I am sure this same phenomenon can rear its ugly head in Web prototyping. Try to get participants to focus on how the graphics work for the site and worry less about the esthetics of the graphics themselves.
As mentioned previously the production stage is the point for detailed blueprints, as well as content mapping and a Web page inventory. For a small site this is fairly easy to put together, although small sites tend to have fewer staff committed to the project. For large projects there needs to be a small cadre of people dedicating much of their time to the site's planning and production. It's a lot of work. And then there comes the actual production of pages. Templates can help, but it's still hard work.
Information Architecture for the World Wide Web is certainly worth a read. It's a few years old, but has aged more gracefully than many others of its ilk by concentrating on the essentials. Anyone who creates a site is an information architect whether they know it or not. It's better to make choices consciously rather than unconsciously. I think that a weakness of the book is a failure to explore user testing more extensively, but this is something that is missed by most books in this category. All in all, a book to read in its entirety and use as a guide along the way.

Dreamland
Restaurant
TuscaloosaView all Tuscaloosa dining
Dreamland is eminently known for barbecue ribs. The original Dreamland Cafe is located about two miles from the intersection of Hwy 82 and Interstate 59 just south of Tuscaloosa in an area known as Jerusalem Heights. In the years since Mr. John "Big Daddy" Bishop first opened his store, little has changed. The roads have been paved much the same as they were back in 1958. The décor inside is warm and dark. The dining room is small with a big bar, a few tables, booths and a pot bellied stove. Beer signs hang from the oak beams and Christmas lights hang from the walls year-round. It isn't fancy, but then again the ribs are the main attraction anyway. The atmosphere is casual down-home. You may rub elbows with somebody famous while you sit at the bar; and people come from all over to enjoy the ribs. The point is that it doesn't matter who you are. At Dreamland everybody is special and everybody is there for the same reason – the ribs. The ribs, service and atmosphere are also available in our other locations. In addition to the legendary ribs and sauce, the menu has been expanded to include such items as baked beans, potato salad, coleslaw, banana pudding, salads, pork sandwiches and barbecue chicken.

Credit for this recognition goes especially to Matilda Stepovich, wife of Michael Stepovich, and Father Lawrence Nevue, S.J. A debt of gratitude is also owing to Father Francis Mueller, S.J., Professor Paul H. McCarthy, Mr. Lee Linck, and Mr. Lawrence S. Gordon.
Now it remains with the good parishioners and all interested donors to maintain the site as the Federal Government requires.
The “little church” was built by the Father Francis Monroe, S.J., in 1904. Its first location was at Dunkel Street near Front Street, situated across the Chena River from its present site and some four hundred feet upstream.
Fairbanks was established as a trading post by Captain E.T. Barnette, in the late summer of 1902. His chartered vessel, “La Velle Young”, had come some twelve miles up the Chena River, a tributary of the Tanana River, when the water became shallow hindering further progress of the vessel. So the captain hurriedly unloaded his cargo and set to work building cabins from trees felled on the spot. So the town came to be…..
The first name given to this small campsite was Barnette’s Landing. Barnette, wishing to attract Judge Wickersham to set up the District Courthouse in his own, offered to name it Wickersham. The judge made no promises as to the location of the courthouse, but he did say it would please him to have the new place named Fairbanks, after the judge’s good friend, Charles Warren Fairbanks, who became Vice-President of the United States in 1905. Barnette agreed, and the town was named after Wickersham’s friend – Fairbanks.
Prospectors were attracted to the trading post, and they chose it as the base of their operations. When Felix Pedro discovered gold in some quantity twelve miles from the post, the news spread rapidly. People from Dawson, Fortymile, Eagle, Circle, and other camps converged on the new town.
Many of the prospectors were Catholics. The Prefect Apostolic for Alaska, the Very Rev. Father Joseph R. Crimont, S.J., notified Father Francis Monroe that he should come to Fairbanks and build a church for the residents and prospectors.
In June of 1904, the two priests arrived at the post, which by this time was teeming with people attracted by the discovery of gold.
Father Monroe set about the task of gathering funds for the new church by begging from gold camp to gold camp. He sought the men of the town to help him build the church.
When $3,000 was collected, Father bought a site for the church. The site he found was located on the east side of the town, on the road which led to the camps. The building was hurriedly begun before the winter set in. The roughly structured building hardly resembled a church, but, it was suitable for services, and it could be used as a library and reading room, giving the miners a place to assemble. After managing to raise about $5,000 more, Father Monroe cleared the debt, and was able to purchase books for the library.
In 1906, the town’s people decided that a hospital was very necessary. A committee of men was drawn up, headed by Mr. Dan Jonas. These men approached Father Monroe and asked him to take on this task. Money for the project was quickly raised, and the work began.
There were several drawbacks to the project. One was the San Francisco earthquake, which made supplies slow to come in from the “outside”. Another was a serious fire that occurred in the business section of Fairbanks. This fire financially ruined many of the original subscribers of the hospital project.
Eventually the necessary funds were raised through a loan, and the building was continued and completed. The hospital was opened on Thanksgiving Day, 1906. The hospital administration passed through several hands. In 1910, the Sisters of Providence of Montreal, Canada, took over the task of staffing and administering Saint Joseph’s Hospital, as it was finally called.
The hospital was remodeled and rebuilt several times. The last such remodeling occurred in 1951. In the late 1960’s Saint Joseph’s Hospital was closed. The old building stood during the 1970’s more or less an eyesore to the community. In the early 1980’s it was gutted, leaving the strong framework, which became the basic structure for the bank and office building which stands behind the church today.
The hospital had been built near an old sawmill on the north side of the Chena, near Cushman Street. The church was on the south side of the Chena, and some distance to the east of the hospital. The disparity in locations caused a difficulty for the priests attending the sick at the hospital and offering daily Mass in the Sister’s chapel. It was decided to move the church from its old place on Dunkel Street to its present location close to the hospital.
The intrepid Father Monroe engaged contractors, and the building was moved from Dunkel Street to the bank of the Chena River. The contractors suggested building a bridge on which to transport the building to the other side of the river. Father decided that this would be too expensive. He dismissed the contractors and continued with his own idea.
First Father Monroe cleared away debris from the old sawmill site. Then he excavated for a hall basement, upon which he would eventually place the church. When the hall foundation was ready, Father proceeded to the task of bringing the other structure across the river.
The river was only about six feet deep and the ice was strong enough to support horses, so Father Monroe proceeded with his plan. He drew lines on the ice about thirty feet apart, running diagonally across the Chena. Then about every eight feet he inserted poles into the ice, hammering them down into the mud at the river bottom. They were supported in such a way as to remain upright, then were left there to freeze in. With the onset of the extreme cold the poles were set. Then they were trimmed evenly to about two feet above the surface of the river. Planks were balanced on them for the four hundred feet which the building would have to be rolled to the other side of the river.
It was quite an event when the church was moved. Bets had been placed as to its success or failure (with the odds moving toward failure). Everyone in town turned out to watch! The movement across the ice was very simple. However, when the spot where the church was to rest was reached, there was a distance of some twenty – five feet to lift the church up the bank. A roadway was cut out of the bank with a somewhat steep grade. Then there was the added lift to the foundation. Father Monroe took the precaution of adding another cable to the building to give it support up the grade and on the lift to its foundation. Some thought that this was as unnecessary expense. It turned out that Father was wise in his decision, for just as the church was to be placed on the prepared foundation, the old cable broke. The new cable held and saved the church and workers from harm.
In the spring of 1912 Father Joseph Cote, S.J., arrived in Fairbanks and did the necessary electrical wiring in the church. He also began the work on the water plant. A residence was added to the church and the downstairs hall was finished.
In 1914, the roof of the church was changed, and the ceiling was raised five feet. A choir loft was added, and a belfry was erected in the front part of the church.
Later the walls were covered with decorative tin, in a fleur – de – lis pattern. This pressed tin work added a special beauty to the church and has a certain charm today because of the singleness of its use in the North. The installation of this tin embellishment was carried out by Father Monroe, Brother Thomas Callahan, S.J. and a young miner, who later became Brother Stephen Karpinski, S.J.
In 1926, Father Patrick O’Reilly, S.J., enhanced the beauty of the “little church” by the installation of its exquisite stained glass windows. In no other church in Alaska are such windows found. It was also Father O’Reilly who looked to the landscaping of the property around the church, adding trees, shrubs, and flowers.
Under Pastor Father John Hayes, S.J., the back stairs to the building were installed, and one of the upstairs resident rooms was pressed into service as the “baby room”, with glass front and loudspeaker in place.
When it was named as a historical monument, a complete face lift was done on the church, together with a paint job according to federal regulations.
Our Lady’s statue, which stands over the front door of the Immaculate Conception Church, adds for us, who are Catholic, a poignant religious charm. She welcomes all to quiet reflection with her Son, Jesus Christ, and she smiles out at his people enjoying the resful beauty of Golden Heart Plaza, which graces the banks of the Chena River.
A special thanks to: James P. Doogan Sr., Father Louis L. Renner, S.J., Hugh Doogan, Sr. Mary Claire McLaughlin, C.S.J., Kerry and Ivar Halvarson, Stu Rothman, and the University of Alaska Archives.

What a weekend. My daughter's soccer team competed in a 3-day tournament, so I spent lots of time at the fields cheering on the girls. We got to bed late last night, and I was looking forward to sleeping in this morning . . . taking the day easy . . . recovering from our hectic schedule over the last few days. But our septic tank had other plans for me, and woke us up bright and early with the blaring horn of its warning system. Looks like we're in for a day of messing around with sewage. Yay!
I'd rather be sitting in my folding chair at the soccer game.
Dinner last night: spaghetti
8 comments:
It's always something, isn't it? Hopefully whatever is wrong is a quick fix.
Sorry. :(
Lovely. Hope you get everything taken care of.
Oh no, not sewage. I'm sorry!!!
Yuck! It is fancy that you have an alarm system though. Around here people mostly just wait for visual clues or smells.
We have one of those grinder pump systems and touch wood it has not sounded the horn yet. Our neighbor had to had their pump fixed twice because their kids throw things down the toilet and it costs a $1,000 a pop to get it fixed!
I guess your daughter will be watching England vs USA in the World Cup tomorrow? Good luck with the sewage ..... yuck ......
Eeeewwwwwww!!!! I'd definitely choose the soccer game too!

SEATTLE -- As Ricardo Lockette sat on the Seattle Seahawks' private plane with his teammates Friday, waiting for it -- and his career -- to finally take off, he was asked to explain his thoughts at that very moment.
And after a long, deep breath, he somehow found the words.
"It's just ... it's just been a long ride, man ..." Lockette told The Herald before trailing off. "And I hope it's only the beginning."
Folks back home in Albany hope so too.
Lockette, the former Monroe and Fort Valley football and track star, had been waiting for the call all season ever since being signed to a three-year deal by the Seahawks in July -- and Tuesday it came during, of all times, a dentist appointment.
"Once I got that news, man, my life ... I can't explain it. Best day of my life," the 6-foot-2, 211-pounder said of the news he got from Seattle GM John Schneider that he was no longer a practice squad receiver, but instead had been called up to the team's active roster for today's 1 p.m. showdown with the Chicago Bears.
Lockette, the 22-year-old former NCAA Division II 200-meter national champ who surprisingly was not selected in April's NFL Draft -- despite posting one of the most jaw-dropping workouts at the combine that saw him run the fastest 40 time of any receiver, and fourth-fastest overall -- admittedly teared up on the spot after finding out his dream was about to come true.
After all, he wasn't sure if the call was ever going to come following inconsistent play in the preseason that saw him haul in just one catch for 16 yards, then promptly being placed on the practice squad, where he's been for the last four months.
But Lockette never gave up hope.
"In the NFL, you have to have a short memory and you can't live in the past. I didn't think about (what happened that got me put on the practice squad), only what I could do to make it back on the team," he said. "It hasn't been too tough because every day I wake up feeling privileged just to be here in this position -- being from a small school like Fort Valley among the USCs, Miamis and Auburns -- and just having a chance to play on the big stage. The last two weeks, I didn't have a single dropped pass in practice -- I think I had something like 350 straight catches -- and the coaches saw that my football knowledge was finally catching up to my athletic ability."
Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll certainly noticed. In fact, Carroll spent nearly three minutes of his weekly press conference with reporters talking about just how far the kid they call "The Rocket" had come.
"We have filled a vacancy. Ricardo Lockette has been moved up. The Rocket is coming up and we're happy to make that move," Carroll said. . And we kind of set our sights on him and said, 'Let's see if we can get this guy.'
"And then we nailed him (down). We thought it was a pretty special (signing)."
Lockette, who only tallied 23 catches for 262 yards and one touchdown with a 24-yard kick-return average during his senior year at FVSU, said Friday it was the support of his teammates that helped keep his spirits high and thoughts positive during his extended time on the practice squad.
"Man, within 20 minutes of (getting the call up), almost everyone on the offense started calling me and texting me because I've really developed friendships with these guys, and they've been pulling for me," said Lockette, who then paused as some of his teammates sitting near him on the plane began cheering for him in the background. "Guys were congratulating me left and right, like (starting quarterback) Tarvaris (Jackson), (starting running back) Marshawn (Lynch), (starting receiver) Mike Williams and one of my best friends here, (starting receiver) Doug Baldwin. It's really felt like a coming out party."
Now, Carroll said, it's time to see what Lockette can do.
"When we got him here, we found out he could really catch the football. He's got very natural hands (like a receiver should)," said Carroll, who then added that Lockette, however, is still a work in progress. "He's still got a long way to go to get connected to the game on this level. It's taken us a while (working with him) but he's getting closer and doing a lot of good things. He makes plays all the time in practice. And he's kind of one our favorites ... we're real excited to give him that chance to get that much closer to playing."
Lockette will be the sixth receiver on the depth chart today against the Bears, as well as the backup to kick returner Leon Washington.
But the Rocket said if his number is called, he'll be ready.
"I'm not quite sure about my playing time (today). We'll just see how the game goes," he said of the road contest against Chicago, which has lost three in a row, while Seattle has won four of its last five. "I just know they're bringing me into a big pressure situation and I have to be ready -- and I will be.
"Everything you do is about confidence. If you believe you can do it. I honestly believe that now."
Lockette said he's left practice every day recently feeling like he was close to getting the call.
"I've been playing a role up until now, and that's OK," he said. "I've just been getting my reps in and hoping I'd be fortunate enough to get the call. And I knew that when the time came, I needed to be ready to take advantage of it."
Carroll said the Seahawks' organization is "fired up" to see Lockette play.
"(Ricardo) is real excited and I know the team is fired up for him because he's tried so hard and given such a great effort to get here," the coach said. "He's really been a great prospect for us -- a guy we've been excited about since we first saw him. He's come miles and miles to get to this point."
When Lockette suits up today, he'll be the third Albany native currently playing in the NFL, joining fellow Monroe grad Deion Branch (New England Patriots) and Dougherty High alum Darryl Smith (Jacksonville Jaguars).
Lockette said he plans to make his city proud -- and live up to the Rocket nickname that he hopes will strike fear in NFL defenses once they get a glimpse of his speed.
"It's stuck with me this far so I don't have a choice but to live up to it," he said. "And while I'm on the field, I want everyone back home to know I'm gonna go out and represent Albany and Monroe High School to the best of my abilities."

VATICAN CITY — Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina was elected in a surprise choice to be the new leader of the troubled Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday, taking the name Francis I and becoming
Jubilant Argentines poured into churches, some crying and praying, after the announcement at the Vatican. “This is a blessing for Argentina,” one woman shouted on a Buenos Aires street.
“I hope he changes all the luxury that exists in the Vatican, that he steers the church in a more humble direction, something closer to the gospel,” said Jorge Andres Lobato, a 73-year-old retired state prosecutor.
The election was enthusiastically welcomed elsewhere in Latin America too.
“We’re happy because we have a new pope and because the choice of a Latin American shows that the Church is opening, is now focused on the entire Church. It’s not just a church only focused on Europe,” said Leonardo Steiner, general secretary of the national conference of Brazilian bishops. was born into a middle-class family of seven, his father an Italian immigrant railway worker and his mother a housewife.
Replacing Pope Benedict, who resigned last month, he overturned one of the main assumptions before the election, that the new pope would be relatively young. on March 19.
U.S. President Barack Obama said the election of Francis “speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world.”
‘PRAY FOR BENEDICT’
In brief remarks from the balcony of St. Peter’s, Francis called on the faithful to pray for Benedict and said the Church was setting off on a “journey of fraternity, of love, of trust”.
It seemed the cardinal electors “went to the end of the world” to find him, he said.
The Vatican said Francis would visit Benedict soon at his temporary home in the summer papal residence outside Rome. tens of thousands in the square cheered even more loudly when Francis appeared, the first pontiff to take that name. “Viva il Papa (pope),” they chanted.

Ruby faces one year jail sentence
An Egyptian court has convicted Egyptian controversial singer/actress Ruby to a one year jail sentence and a fine of one thousand Egyptian pounds for not paying taxes overdue.
Ruby had received a sum of one million Egyptian pounds for her role in the recent film “Al Waed” (The promise), which she starred in alongside prominent Egyptian actor Mahmoud Yasin and actor Aser Yaseen, and failed to pay taxes for the amount she received. It is said that she owed the taxation department 200 thousand pounds but failed to pay them and so she was prosecuted and convicted.
Ruby did not make any public statement regarding her jail sentence. It is said that she will attempt to make mends with the taxation department and pay all the taxes she owes in return of having all charges dropped.

The explosion also damaged nearby buildings, including the al-Batool women and children's hospital, AFP said.
About 90 minutes later in the nearby town of Ghalbiyah, a suicide bomber blew up his explosives-filled car in the midst of a crowd of Shiite pilgrims, killing two and injuring 16 other people, an official in the provincial security command said. Among the wounded were Diyala deputy governor Sadiq al-Husseini and three of his bodyguards, and two media employees of local satellite channel Diyala TV.

Filed under Destination weddings, Los Cabos weddings, Photography in Mexico, Uncategorized, Villas
Thinking about a villa wedding in Cabo? Check out this one beautiful romantic Cabo wedding. Wedding planning by: Be That Bride Events. Thank you, Yarai!! This was a wonderfully coordinated Cabo San Lucas event. Wedding hair and makeup by Los Cabos makeup artist Suzanne Morel. And last, but not least, Matter of Taste Catering who dressed in beautiful grey dress shirts to match the event. The day was beautiful. This bride Abby was–is–extremely special to me. When we first started to chat, she had originally wanted Esperanza, and then Las Ventanas, for her destination wedding ceremony. Both venues already had bookings so we decided the best wedding venue for this very intimate and romantic wedding would at a villa…and then one villa ended up to be three villas, and the weekend was set. Beautiful villas provided by our dear friends at Cabo Villas, a.k.a. Earth Sea and Sky. Cabo Villas has almost all the villas in Cabo San Lucas that rent for events. Abby I loved from the very start. If you look at the photos you will see she is so full of love, it just cannot be contained. An extremely smart and detailed bride that was on top of everything. I loved working with her and will miss our phone calls. The wedding weekend started with a beautiful rehearsal dinner at Edith’s Restaurant, then the wedding day was at Villa de los Suenos, followed by a farewell brunch the next day. I am looking forward to seeing Abby and Omar very soon! And to the mother and father of the bride, Becky and Gus, you both will be long-lasting friends. Dinner in Cabo is a must for all of us. This event was truly a day that will stand out in our minds forever!! Love, blessing, and joy~ T

For this wedding, I had the pleasure of second shooting with the world renowned Gene Higa. Gene is one of the top photographers in the world that I highly look up to and that made capturing this wedding an awesome experience for me. The day started out with the traditional chinese door games and tea ceremony which is always a great start to the day. We also got some beautiful photos at Stanford where it felt like wedding central with a ton of bridal parties there for portraits. I look forward to hopefully working with Gene again soon!
One of my favorite shots of the day.

Change is the law of life. And those who
look only to the past or present
are certain to miss the future.
— John F. Kennedy, Speech, June 25, 1963
What was true in the New Frontier era is even more accurate a half-century later: Change is accelerating and is doing so in every element of our lives. Public affairs and communications are not immune from this reality. The challenge is to manage change; to make it work for us, not overwhelm us.
My goal as a consultant is to help clients do just that – blending experience and innovation to forge strategies that work.
This is not about reading crystal balls. It is using analytical and strategic expertise to look beyond an immediate crisis and focus on long-term objectives.
What's your goal? What's your message? What are your priorities? Sound planning concentrates on core issues and recognizes that the social, economic, technological, and political context in which you work will constantly evolve. An effective consultant works with you to analyze your needs and find the answers you demand.
Because "going forward" shouldn't just be a rhetorical flourish. It's a strategic imperative.

The US government has sued to block telecoms giant AT&T's $39bn purchase of T-Mobile USA, citing concerns it will harm competition in the wireless market and lead to higher prices.
The surprise move by the Department of Justice (DoJ) on Wednesday was the biggest antitrust challenge yet by the Obama administration.
If successful, it would end AT&T's move to unseat Verizon Wireless as the number one US mobile carrier.
DoJ officials warned that allowing AT&T, the country's second largest wireless carrier, to buy up the number four carrier would be disastrous for consumers.
"Were the merger to proceed, there would only be three providers with 90 per cent of the market, and competition among the remaining competitors on all dimensions, including price, quality and innovation, would be diminished," James Cole, the deputy attorney general, said.
The lawsuit came just five months after the deal was announced and, despite the timing, one source close to the case told the Reuters news agency it was a real attempt to halt a "fundamentally flawed" deal, not a tactic to wring big concessions from AT&T.
Justice department officials said they were willing to consider proposals to alleviate their concerns, but they expected the fight to shift to federal court.
The court case could take months and cost millions of dollars.
They [the mobile carriers] would have to give up "so much" to win approval, the source, who wished to remain anonymous, said. Legal response weighed
AT&T quickly indicated that it would not abandon the transaction, and together with T-Mobile is considering a legal response to challenge federal regulators.
In a statement, T-Mobile's owner, the German company Deutsche Telekom, said it is disappointed by the DoJ's action and "will join AT&T in defending the contemplated merger".
AT&T has several incentives to take up a legal fight with regulators.
In court, the burden is on the DoJ - not AT&T - to show that the combination would harm competition.
If the deal does not go through, the company will be forced to pay T-Mobile a $3bn break-up fee and give it some wireless spectrum rights.
AT&T said it will ask for an expedited court hearing "so the enormous benefits of this merger can be fully reviewed".
Morgan Reed, executive director of the trade group, Association for Competitive Technology, said AT&T has at least one key fact on its side: Deutsche Telekom has said it does not plan to continue to invest in upgradingthe T-Mobile network to deliver faster wireless.
That means, "T-Mobile is not a competitor anymore", Reed said.
"T-Mobile has already stepped away from the table. We're at three nationwide wireless carriers no matter what."
The association, which represents more than 3,000 small and independent application developers, believes the merger would benefit the wireless broadband industry.
However, the lawsuit used some of T-Mobile's own documents describing its role in the market to explain why the merger should not take place.
In those documents, the company calls itself "the No. 1 challenger of the established big guys in the market and as well positioned in a consolidated 4-player national market.''
AT&T and T-Mobile compete nationwide, in 97 of the largest 100 cellular marketing areas, according to the suit filed in US District Court in Washington. They also vie for business and government customers.
What lawsuit says
The lawsuit says the acquisition would eliminate a company that has boosted competition with low pricing and innovation.
Democrat Herb Kohl, who heads the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, said the suit was an effort to protect consumers "in a powerful and growing industry that reaches virtually every American".
AT&T and T-Mobile Federal Complaints Commission and the Obama administration.
But the DoJ said AT&T could "obtain substantially the same network enhancements ... if it simply invested in its own network without eliminating a close.

A diplomatic row has erupted between India and Italy after two Indian fisherman were shot dead in a confrontation between an Italian oil tanker and their fishing boat in waters off the sourthern Indian coast.
Indian police have detained the entire crew, including Italian navy officers, over the killings, while Italy's ambassador in New Delhi was summoned to the foreign office.
An Indian coast guard official said the naval guards aboard the Enrica Lexie appeared to have mistaken the fishermen for pirates.
"I think they have erred in their judgment. Innocent fisherman should not be fired at, even anywhere, there is no doubt," said Surinder Pal Singh Basra, inspector general of India's coast guard.
Basra said the Italian vessel violated international protocol by not sending any distress signal, which is considered standard procedure during pirate attacks.
He said the incident had occurred on Wednesday in waters off India's southern state of Kerala, and said Indian coast guards had done their duty by bringing the Italian ship to port and detaining its captain and crew.
A murder case has been registered against the crew, said a senior official at a police station in Neendakara Coastal police station, where surviving fishermen sought help.
A foreign ministry official said Italy's ambassador was asked to ensure the crew of the ship co-operated with Indian authorities.
The Italian navy in a statement said on Thursday that the fishing boat had behaved aggressively and had been warned on several occasions by the naval officers aboard the.

Labradors love going on journeys and finding new places. They love the fresh air of the countryside and the new smells in the city. Take some time to read the following and then you too can take your labrador on the trip of a lifetime!
Travelling by
car
is the most popular form of travel. Usually a blanket is placed on the back seat for the dog to use. The blanket is often more comfortable than the material the seats are made of. For labradors who are trained the blanket will also represent their designated area for the duration of the journey.
There are those dogs that get very excited are that enjoy a good nap. For these labs a car seat or even a seat belt is a great product to buy. There are plenty of great products you can buy for your lab.
Pet Travel has also become quite popular up in the skies.
Pet Air Travel
has become very easy to arrange. You will be able to find a number of airlines that are more than happy to book your labrador on the flight.
However, due to their size it is highly unlikely that a labrador would be allowed in the cabin area. Smaller dogs would be allowed as long as they remained below the passenger seat and in a travel box. Labradors though, are too big and would have to be checked into the hold.
Finding a Pet Friendly Hotel is also becoming a lot easier. There are many hotels around the world that are opening their doors to pets. Please try to make sure that your dog is
well behaved
before trying to take him on holiday with you.
Before you make any bookings for flights or for hotels be sure that your labrador will alright.
Have a look at our
checklist
for a short list of items you may need to take with you when you are travelling with your labrador.
Hopefully this information will be helpful to you on your next holiday. Good luck and have a great holiday.

Louie Records: swingd and time share
The brightest development in jazz and new music in the United States and throughout the worldis the regular emergence of players and recording labels who are not bound by notions of commerce and mass appeal, but rather reflect the fact that the music continues to attract people who find new things to do with it.
Louie Records from Oregon has showcased thoughtful players from the Northwest who, as on these recordings, have taken standard formats and rethought them. Drummer Dave Storrs (he also plays keys) is the common thread on both of these quartet recordings and he is also the founder of the label. Both recordings are from 2005 and both beautifully complement the expanding catalogue of the label..

King Crimson: The Collectable King Crimson Volume One (2007)
In 1973-74, King Crimson was not just a powerful progressive rock group capable of navigating guitarist Robert Fripp's most challenging writing to date. It was also a potent improvising unit, able to shift on a dime from elegant simplicity to visceral crunch. The expansive The Great Deceiver (Live 1973-1974) demonstrated how exciting this group was. The Collectable King Crimson Volume One allows those without deep pockets to hear the music for themselves, and it also offers something new to those who own the four-CD box.
Discipline Global Mobile's mail-order King Crimson Collector's Club has been releasing live shows of varying sound quality from all Crimson lineups for some time. This double-disc set is the first of a series intended to make some of the best KCCC shows more widely available. It collects a March, 1974 performance in Mainz, Germany where Crimson's at an improvising peak, and one of its last dates, recorded in Ashbury Park, New Jersey. Both are superb, but the latter is especially notable.
Some of the material from the June 28, 1974 show can be found on USA, released in 1975 and reissued in remastered and expanded form in 2006, but both versions had problems. First, technical problems rendered violinist David Cross' parts unusable. Cross was fired soon after the show, so Fripp brought in keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson to overdub parts after the fact. Second, both an extended "Easy Money" and free improv called "Ashbury Park" were cut nearly in half and faded out. Continuity was also compromised by altering the running sequence.
Thanks to modern technology, it has been possible to restore Cross' parts. The Collectable King Crimson makes this show available on CD for the first time, restored to its proper running order with complete versions of all the tracks. This set of material ranges from the symphonic "Exiles" to the jagged metal edge of "Lark's Tongues in Aspic: Part II" and the mind-numbing guitar pyrotechnics of the complex "Fracture." What's immediately obvious here is that Jobson may have been a better musician, but that's no substitute for the chemistry that evolves from having performed nearly two hundred shows together. USA is a good record, but the restored performance is a great one.
The Mainz set is incomplete, but it demonstrates that while Crimson may not have possessed the language of jazz, it certainly had the spirit. "Easy Money" evolves into an open-ended and dynamically shifting improv that neatly segues into a (sadly faded) "Fracture." Three other improvs, including two that bookend the idiosyncratic "Dr. Diamond" (never released on a Crimson studio album), find the group in even stronger synchronicity.
The sound source and quality are provided for both shows, with Mainz listed as "Very Fine" and Ashbury Park "Excellent," though it's hard to hear any significant difference. An auspicious beginning to a new series, The Collectable King Crimson Volume One will help keep the ever-evolving Crimson in the public eye while fans wait for a new album from the group's latest lineup.
Track Listing: CD1 (Ashbury Park): Walk On...No Pussyfooting; Lark's Tongues in Aspic: Part II; Lament; Exiles; Ashbury Park; Easy Money; Fracture; Starless; 21st Century Schizoid Man. CD2 (Mainz): Improv: The Savage; Dr. Diamond; Improv: Arabica; Exiles; Improv: Atria; The Night Watch; Starless; Lament; Improv: Trio; Easy Money.
Personnel: David Cross: violin, mellotron, electric piano; Robert Fripp: guitar, mellotron, electric piano; John Wetton: bass guitar, vocals; Bill Bruford: drums, percussion.

Young British composer/alto saxophonist Jake Fryer joins forces with veteran bopper Bud Shank and his favorite West Coast rhythm section, to form the Jake Fryer / Bud Shank Quintet for In Good Company. It's a lively and engaging album, a mix of standards and Fryer originals that brings the two alto saxophonists together for a recording date full of spontaneity, mutual respect and enjoyment. Sadly, it also proved to be the 82 year-old Shank's valedictory recording, as he was not in good health and died on April 2nd 2009, the day after the session took place.
In his liner notes, Fryer refers to In Good Company as "a first takes album." This approach ensures that the recording has the excitement and fun of a late night jam session. Sure, there are occasional imperfections and minor errors, but their appearances are few and do nothing to disrupt the Quintet's swagger and swing. Shank may not be at the height of his powers, but he can still blow.
The two saxophonists have distinct but complementary tones: Shanks has the tighter, "alto-going-on-soprano" sound; Fryer the mellower, "alto-going-on-tenor" sound. The three rhythm section playersbassist Bob Magnusson, pianist Mike Wofford and drummer Joe LaBarberaare reliable, solid, and tight; but, above all, swinging.
The quintet opens with Juan Tizol and Duke Ellington's perennial favorite, "Caravan." After Magnusson's slinky introduction, Shank storms into his opening solo with verve, and Wofford and LaBarbera swiftly settle in behind him. Fryer's own tunes, six in all, carry on with this high energy bebop approach. "Bopping With Bud," written in tribute to the veteran player, gives the two altoists a chance to trade phrases and solos in friendly competition, while "Tip Top and Tickety Boo" races along merrily, with both Fryer and Shank delivering some fluid and complex lines. Fryer wrote "The Time Lord" expressly for LaBarbera, who repays the honor with inventive and driving percussion. The band eases down a little for Lerner and Lowe's "Almost Like Being In Love," its smoothly low key performance the most overtly romantic on the album.
Fryer, who also heads up the London Bebop Collective, achieved an ambition when Shank agreed to join him for this date. In Good Company gives little indication of Shank's problems. It is, by contrast, an affirmation of life: a joyous blast of a performance, a worthy epitaph for the veteran saxophonist and a strong musical statement from Fryer and the Quintet.ussson: bass; Joe LaBarbera: drums.

EYEMARK Entertainment takes a fresh approach to daytime syndication's most established genre - creating a talk show that offers solutions - with its national launch of the daily series Dr. Joy Browne on September 13, 1999.
The new hour will air primarily in daytime and early afternoon on stations in 150 markets, representing more than 90 percent of the U.S.
Dr. Joy Browne is hosted by the licensed clinical psychologist and best-selling author whose daily radio talk show, syndicated to 300 U.S. and Canadian stations, is the longest-running, most-successful program of its kind. Burt Dubrow, the multi-award-winning producer recognized as the driving force behind television's most innovative and successful talk shows, is Executive Producer.
"I'd really like to put a new spin on what we all recall as the beginnings of modern talk television," explains Browne. "The early series did something wonderful, because they let us know these problems - ones that we were never able to admit - really existed. You didn't have to be ashamed, you weren't alone. Back then, you felt like you knew the people who appeared to discuss personal issues or you would like to know them by the end of the episode. Their problems could have been your problems. And what we add, which makes this concept more relevant for today, is that their solutions can be your solutions."
In the classic talk format, each episode of Dr. Joy Browne will explore a single personal topic - with subjects covering relationships, family, workplace and life changes - through the real-life stories of diverse people confronting them. The series is distinguished from other talk shows, however, in two significant ways. According to Dubrow, "First and foremost, the goal of each episode will be to fix problems, not create them. Also, many shows feature a segment where the host talks with an expert, to offer some insight into a day's issue. In the case of Dr. Joy Browne, our host and expert are one and the same. From the very first question she raises with a guest, Dr. Joy has the credentials and ability to cut to the heart of the issue, drive a person to understand what he or she is really confronting and help evaluate the options."
A licensed clinical psychologist who has hosted issue-driven talk radio for 20 years, Browne has a daily radio program currently syndicated in the U.S. and Canada through WOR. Commended by the media as "classy and consistently sensible... the radio psychologist for people who thought they hated radio psychologists" and "(with a) cut-to-the-chase but fundamentally kind style, she's outlived imitators," Browne has received high-profile recognition for her work. She was recently honored with the American Psychological Association's first-ever President's Award for her contributions to the profession; named "Top Female Radio Talk Show Host" by the National Association of Talk Show Hosts for 1996 and 1997, and selected as a member of Vanity Fair magazine's "Hall of Fame" in 1996. Prior to WOR, she hosted talk shows on WITS (now WSSH) Boston; KGO and KCBS, both in San Francisco, and WABC New York.
Browne is equally prolific and recognized in the publishing world. Her sixth book, "The Nine Fantasies That Will Ruin Your Life" was published in Fall 1998 by Crown Publishers Inc. as part of a two-book deal with Random House. Winning a five-star review from Amazon.com, the book has sold more than 53,000 copies and has been released as an audiocassette as well. Browne's seventh book, "It's A Jungle Out There, Jane" - which she describes as a survival guide for understanding the male animal - will be released in Fall 1999.
She is a licensed clinical psychologist on the board of the American Psychological Association, listed in the National Register of Healthcare Providers.Dr. Joy Browne is produced in New. Y.

Pre-need Insurance
Pre-need insurance was once referred to as "death insurance" and is a type of life insurance. A funeral can be a large financial burden to the family and loved ones left behind after a death. By setting up a type of pre-need burial insurance, you can help offset these costs. It is important to check with your local government since each State has its own laws governing burial insurance. Find out if your insurance can be transferred to another state if necessary. Be careful not to leave any blank spots in the contract that might be filled in after your death and make sure to deal only with a licensed insurance company or individual. Both funeral directors and insurance brokers sell burial insurance that are written to include all the services and products you require or want.
These can include:
- The casket or urn
- Embalming if necessary
- Grave liner or burial vault
- Hearse
- Flowers
- Digging and filling the grave
- Grave marker
- Cemetery plot
Pre-Need Trust Account
A trust account is a pre-payment for funeral services that is deposited with a trust company or in a bank. Banks are federally insured by the United States government, making the funds 100% secure. Larger, pooled trusts can earn higher rates of interest as well. Be sure to check with your funeral director about the regulations regarding trusts in your state as they can vary from state to state. The main advantage of putting money into a trust fund is that it can be paid to the funeral director immediately upon death. These accounts can earn a higher return rate than pre-need insurance accounts, but unlike pre-need insurance programs, trusts are also taxable.
Another trust option is called an irrevocable trust that is not counted as a financial asset. These funds are designated solely for funeral services and cannot be otherwise spent. If you ever need to apply for social services such as Medicaid, irrevocable trusts are a great option. Be sure to talk to your funeral director to find out which program best suits your needs.
Tax advantages of Pre-need Insurance
- Most pre-need insurance plans are not taxable
- Pre-need funeral policies do not negatively affect eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid
- Most policies can be transferred between funeral homes and states
- Some policies will even leave money behind for the survivors after funeral services have been paid

The Netflix rental service really revolutionized the way to rent DVD movies. Instead of driving to a store, looking for something you want to watch, waiting in lines, and dealing with due dates and late fees, people can now enjoy the convenience of online DVD rentals at a low-cost thanks to Netflix.
Click for Netflix Free Trial
Netflix DVD Rental ServiceAs the world's biggest online DVD rental service, with millions of subscribers, Netflix has a lot to offer its members. They have a huge selection of 85,000 different DVD titles to choose from, as well as thousands of full-length movies and TV shows that can be watched via computer. Shipping is free both ways, and it is fast since Netflix operates many distribution centers around the country. There are no due dates, late fees or other hassles—there is just a flat, low monthly fee that offers movie lovers a tremendous value.
With over 85,000 different DVD titles, there is a huge selection designed to satisfy eveybody. In fact, there are over 200 different genres that are all neatly categorized to easily browse. Chances are that your local DVD rental store has just a tiny fraction of these, and may often not have anything you want to see. With all these choices, you will have a nearly endless supply of different movies you want to watch.
With all these different titles, some may wrongly assume it is hard to find the good titles that match your interests. On the contrary, it is very simple and there are multiple ways to browse the DVDs. You can take a look at the new releases, top 100 and critics picks, to get a constantly changing view of hot titles to watch.

Skips & Jumps lyrics
Album: This Illusion Sound
Society in a mess
Reflecting all the skips and the jumps in my head
Look at me, do my best
I'm doing when the doing is doing in my head
Sweet unknown, make me blessed
The distance from this place to your door is my test
Looking at me, looking at you
Looking for the missing piece of treasure that I need to be true
A little understanding
A bit of faith and all that stuff
You'll be amazed how much it all works out
You open up your window
I'll open up my door to you
You'll be amazed how much it all works out
All works out

High heels gosh you look sexy
I'd steal a touch if you let me
I'm just dyin' to kick it with you girl
Hey boo show me you're ready
Lips looking juicy like cherry
I can almost taste your flavor girl
hook
But it seems like you're the wrong type
Don't you ever get upset girl I'd like to see you sweat
It just feels like you're too uptight
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I wanna live
chorus
I wanna a freaky girl somebody just like me
Someone who understands just what a player needs
Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me
A very naughty girl that's what I need
verse
Handcuffs can you get freaky
How far will you go to please me
Whips and chains girl are you down with that
Strange places searching for pleasure
I want you to meet me wherever
Wearing just an overcoat and hat
hook
Or was I right you're the wrong type
You don't ever get upset I ain't never seen you sweat
It just feels like you're too uptight
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I wanna

Well Christmas Fans, it's that time of year again when we start getting ready for the rush of the Holidays, and make sure that we're all set up on the forum for the new Christmas Season!
You'll notice (as is tradition) that the really, really long threads have been restarted. This will help our load time, and is much less scary for newbies to jump into the conversation!
A few other things as well, the Christmas Media forum is now called "Christmas TV & Movies", this makes lots more sense.
The Christmas Traditions and Christmas Recollections forums have been joined together, another smart move, since neither were that busy all by themselves. I've also changed the Christmas Recipes forum to include Crafts, so we finally have a place to talk about all those projects we love!
Also new this year is our Pinterest Board which I'll admit doesn't have much on it - yet - but in the coming weeks I'll be taking ideas from the forum, and around the web, and start sharing them on the board, which should automatically post on our Facebook Page (and therefore our Twitter), so you can stay updated with lots of great Holiday ideas!
As always, let me know if you have any questions! :D

“If you were stranded on a desert island, what’s the one beauty product you’d take with you?”
It’s one of the most overused, cliché questions in the beauty industry. I mean, honestly, who ever gets stranded on a desert island? And if you were, wouldn’t you be more concerned about running from smoke monsters or finding a secret hatch of supplies? (Maybe I watched too much Lost). But researchers might have discovered one woman who actually had a desert-island beauty product: Amelia Earhart.
This week, the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) found remnants of what they think is an ointment jar from the early 20th century—on the same Pacific island where Earhart is presumed to have died. The jar, which resembles Dr. C. H Berry’s Freckle Ointment, might clear up at least part of the mystery surrounding Earhart’s death in 1937.
"It's well documented Amelia had freckles and disliked having them," TIGHAR researcher Joe Cerniglia told Discovery News.
Other recovered items resemble women’s products, including a three-ounce bottle that could be Campana Italian Balm, a hand lotion from the 1930s. The researchers will be analyzing the artifacts at a conference in Virginia this month. It will be interesting to see if cosmetics can solve the 75-year-old mystery—and even more interesting to know what other emergency products Earhart packed in her makeup bag on that fateful day.

Putting some of the power of programming into the hands of artists and designers can be a great thing. When they can customize the behavior of an object directly, without making the roundtrip through a programmer, there is a lot more room for experimentation and iteration. As a result you get better looking things with more interesting interactions.
Plus, if the artists do their own damn programming it means less work for me, so everybody wins.
Of course I don’t expect artists to actually program, but rather to use tools that expose that power, such as shader graphs, visual scripting systems, or — the topic of this post — expression languages.
By an expression language I mean a tiny little programming language that can be used to (and only used to) write one-line mathematical expressions, such as:
sin(t) + 0.1 * cos(10 * t)
So it is a really simple little calculator language. Simpler than Lisp. Simpler than Forth. (Well maybe not, but simpler than trying to teach artists Lisp or Forth.) This simplicity has two advantages. First, it makes it easier to write and understand the expressions. Second, it makes it possible to compute the expressions efficiently, which is important, because it allows us to use them in more places without worrying too much about the performance or memory costs.
The expression language can be used to replace static values where we want the artist to be able to specify more unique behaviors. Some examples:
- In the particle system it can be used to script complicated custom particle behaviors that are hard to produce with other types of controllers.
- In the animation system it can be used to compute the play speed and blend values of animations based on controller variables.
- In the physics system it can be used to define custom force fields to achieve special effects, such as tornados, explosions or whirlwinds.
Computing the Expressions
Since the expressions are so simple, usually not more than a few operators, we need to be able to evaluate them with as little overhead as possible. Otherwise, the overhead will dominate the execution cost. This means that we should use a simple design, such as a stack-based virtual machine. That may sound complicated, but the concepts are really quite simple. What it means is that we convert our expression to a sequence of operations that pushes or pops data from a computation stack. So our example from above:
sin(t) + 0.1 * cos(10 * t)
Gets converted into:
t sin 0.1 10 t * cos * +
Here t pushes the value of the variable t to the stack. sin pops the top value from the stack, computes it and pushes the result to the stack. 0.1 pushes the value 0.1 to the stack. + pops two values from the stack, adds them together and pushes the result to the stack. * works the same way. If you go through the operations in the example you see that it computes the same result as the original expression.
This way of writing expressions is called Reverse Polish notation (RPN) or postfix notation and it’s the basis for the programming language Forth.
If we examine the issue, we see that we really just need three types of operations in our byte code:
- PUSH_VARIABLE
- pushes the content of a variable to the stack
- PUSH_FLOAT
- pushes a floating point number to the stack
- COMPUTE_FUNCTiON
- pops the arguments of the stack, computes the result and pushes it to the stack
- END
- marks the end of the byte code
For simplicity I use 32 bits for each bytecode word. The upper 8 bits specify the type of the operation and the lower 24 bits is the data. For a variable the data is the index of the variable in a variable list. When compiling the bytecode you specify a list of variable names: {“t”, “x”}. And when executing you specify a corresponding list of variable values: {0.5, 20.1}. Similarly, for COMPUTE_FUNCTION, the data is an index into a function table. For PUSH_FLOAT we need an extra code word to hold the data, since we want 32 bit floats.
We can now write the function that runs the virtual machine, it is not much code at all:
Compiling the Byte Code
Compiling an expression involves three phases, tokenizing the data to a stream of input symbols, transforming that stream from infix to postfix notation and finally generating the byte code from that.
Tokenization means matching the identifiers in the expressions against a list of variable names and function names. We can also support contants that get converted to floats directly in the tokenization process. That is useful for things like pi.
The tokenization process converts our sample expression to something like this:
{ sin, (, t, ), +, 0.1, *, cos, (, 10, *, t, ) }
Now we need to convert this to infix notation. One way would be to write a full blown yacc parser with all that entails, but for this kind of simple expressions we can get away with something simpler, such as Dijkstra’s Shunting Yard algorithm.
I actually use an even simpler variant that doesn’t support right-associative operators, where I just process the input tokens one by one. If the token is a value or a variable I put it directly in the output. If the token is a function or an operator I push it to a function stack. But before I do that, I pop all functions with higher precedence from the function stack and put them in the output. Precedence takes parenthesis level into account, so a + nested in three parentheses has higher precedence than a * nested in two.
Let us see how this works for our simple example:
Constant Folding
To further improve efficiency we may want to distinguish the cases where the users have actually written an expression (such as “sin x”) from the cases where they have just written a constant (“0.5”) or a constant valued expression (“2*sin(pi)”). Luckily, constant folding is really easy to do in an RPL expression.
After tokenizing and RPL conversion, the expression “2 * sin(pi)” has been converted to:
2 3.14159265 sin *
We can constant fold a function of arity n if the n argument that preceedes it are constants. So in the sample above we can constant fold sin to:
2 3.14159265 sin *
2 0 *
Continuing, we can fold *
2 0 *
0
If we end up with a constant expression, the byte code will used be a single PUSH_FLOAT operation. We can detect that and bypass the expression evaluation all together for that case.
Source Code
If you want to start playing with these things you can start with my expression language source code.

An Unhappy Anniversary
Stay up to date with the latest headlines via email..).
A 'nonfunctioning city': A White House " Fact Sheet" released in advance of Katrina's one-year anniversary notes that FEMA has provided $5.6 billion to repair and replace damaged public infrastructure. But Gulf Coast Recovery coordinator Donald E. Powell has admitted that nearly a third of the trash in New Orleans has yet to be picked up. Sixty percent of New Orleans homes still lack electricity and just 66 percent of public schools have reopened. Only 17 percent of the city's buses are operational, causing severe problems for the many residents who don't own cars -- "a major factor in the government's failure to evacuate residents before the storm." "Look at what we're getting in terms of services," said Janet Howard of the Bureau of Governmental Research, a nonprofit group in New Orleans. " It's basically a nonfunctioning city." Crime has risen again in New Orleans -- the homicide rate is nearly 10 times the national average -- but only seven of 13 courtrooms have reopened and judges have a backlog of nearly 7,000 cases. A recent report by the Department of Justice found that in New Orleans, "justice is simply unavailable." But where the federal, state, and local governments have been absent, citizen activism has surged in the wake of the storm, " chipping away at some of this city's unhealthy institutions." Many schools -- formerly in " the control of a corrupt district office" -- are now being managed by parents and community activists as charter schools, and newcomers are pushing for reform and tighter ethics in the city council.
Poverty forgotten: One of the president's boldest promises after Hurricane Katrina was his promise to fight poverty nationwide: ." But as soon as Katrina disappeared from the headlines, " poverty and antipoverty policy disappeared once again from the public agenda." Most recently, the Senate voted down a minimum wage increase because the conservative leadership, in a political ploy, tied it to a cut in inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates. The federal minimum wage hasn't been raised since 1996 and eight million Americans continue to live on $5.15 an hour. Since Bush took office, the number of Americans living in poverty has increased by 5.4 million and an additional 1.4 million children fell into poverty between 2000 and 2004. The poverty rates for African-Americans and Hispanics ( 23 percent) continues to be far higher than the poverty rate for whites (8.6 percent). While Bush did follow through on his promise to create Gulf Opportunity Zones -- tax incentives for regional business development -- Alter notes that they have become "mostly an opportunity for Southern companies owned by GOP campaign contributors to make some money in New Orleans." To date, Congress has taken no action on Bush's call for Worker Recovery Accounts, which would provide $5,000 for evacuees seeking education and job training, or on the Urban Homesteading Act, which would provide free building sites via a lottery to low-income evacuees.
More ailments, less medical care: Health care is an increasing problem in the post-Katrina Gulf Coast. The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals estimated that " New Orleans has lost half of its physicians and suffers from a shortage of 1,000 nurses." Forty-four percent of adult caregivers now lack health coverage and "34 percent of children in FEMA-subsidized communities have at least one chronic health condition that requires treatment, but half of the affected children no longer have a medical provider." Even though the population of New Orleans is at less than half of its pre-storm population, the suicide rate has tripled and there is no capacity to deal with mental health and substance abuse problems. The people of New Orleans are also suffering from a lack of hospitals and the inability to receive immediate care from emergency rooms.
Federal waste and mismanagement: The federal mismanagement of Hurricane Katrina's aftermath has permanently damaged Bush's approval rating. White House counselor Dan Bartlett recently said, "It was a setback at the time, but it was recoverable and has been." But the American public disagrees. Bush's approval rating before Katrina was at 60 percent. Immediately after the hurricane hit, it fell to 52 percent and in mid-Sept. 2005, it dropped to 49 percent. It is now at just 36 percent. Sixty-six percent of the American public (and 84 percent of New Orleans residents) rate the government's recovery efforts negatively, according to a recent ABC News poll. A June Government Accountability Office report found that between $600 million and $1.4 billion in taxpayer dollars has been wasted on " improper and potentially fraudulent individual assistance payments." Payments went to Katrina evacuees to pay for items such as Dom Perignon champagne, New Orleans Saints season tickets and adult-oriented entertainment. A recent report by the House Committee on Government Reform found that 19 Katrina contracts -- worth $8.75 billion -- " experienced significant overcharges, wasteful spending or mismanagement."
Levees not ready: Yesterday, Powell said, "I believe that the levees are ready for hurricane season. ... The levees are back to where they were pre-Katrina, and they're on their way to being the best, better and stronger then they have ever been." But Powell's upbeat rhetoric contradicts assessments by the head of the Army Corps of Engineers, who recently expressed skepticism that the New Orleans levees could withstand a hurricane with a heavy storm surge this year. In order for the levees to withstand a Category 5 hurricane and for residents of New Orleans to finally feel safe, another $30 billion will need to be spent. Unfortunately, as the New Orleans Times-Picayune notes, the federal government's "commitment to the long-term protection of South Louisiana is still uncomfortably murky.

Thirty years after the civil rights era, middle-class African-American families face a grim reality: their kids are far more likely to experience downward mobility in today's economy than they are to move up... In Being Black, Living in the Red, Dal."
Crucial to understanding how that impacts economic mobility is the concept of "intergenerational assistance." That's just a fancy way of saying that your chances to advance economically are very much impacted by whether your family can help with tuition payments, a down payment on a house or seed money to start a business. Conley compares two hypothetical kids -- one from a family with some money and the other without. Both are born with the same level of intelligence, both are ambitious and both work hard in school..

What's internet brand equity? It's a measure of who's talking about you online, based on Internet data, social media, blogs and the top 75,000 print and electronic media outlets. The resulting tool, the group claims, gauges the relative value of the various institutions and how they change over time.
The Global Language Monitor created their ranking system in order to eliminate what they described as inherent bias in the other published ranking systems. Rather than emphasizing the opinions of college deans, high school guidance counselors and the ratio of the endowment to the number of students, GLM believes their method reflects the opinion of the world at large.

The real humor is that anyone thinks those things have anything to do with the quality of a school.
Judging from the picture it appears that Wisconsin's "brand equity" took a major boost from their football team.
Perhaps Chicago should apply to rejoin the Big Ten? Maybe Harvard could dip into its endowment for a big-time basketball coach and petition to join the Big East for basketball purposes? It's not that Harvard doesn't have a catalog full of gut courses that the basketball players could take to keep their eligibility.
UW is a breeding ground for CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, coming in at #4 in the country. .
However, like the CBO, you could also argue that UW is dead last, if that's what helps you get through the day.
Hey, you may have beat out Harvard and the University of Chicago in internet brand equity, but I'd rather have TCU's football team.
How odd that outside the Ivies, MIT, UC, and Berkley, that the winners of a popularity contest based on volume are schools with large alumni bases.
It's almost as surprising as a Big 10 team being ranked #1 in September.
Freeman, of course, is right. If the product doesn't measure up, all the marketing in the world won't save it.
PS Considering how badly managed a lot of US companies are, maybe the breeding ground needs a little work.
Hey, DKW, we did beat the spread.
I blame football.
Perhaps they have a prominent blogger posting stories about them occasionally.
There might be an "Althouse Effect" at work. And for University of Chicago, ChicagoBoyz might help give them a bump. The five Ivies on the list are Ivies, and people who attended Ivy league schools make a point to use every available opportunity to remind people that they attended an Ivy.
A little surprised that of the UCs, Berkeley made the top ten and UCLA didn't, but then, negative buzz is still buzz, and the methodology mentioned doesn't seem to sort bad buzz from good, and plenty of folks use Berzerkley as their go-to campus for highlighting nutty leftiness.
MIT is MIT, and interesting stuff is always bubbling out of there, bet CalTech games the next survey to knock MIT down and put themselves on top.
If Bristol Palin really ends up attending ASU, expect them to suddenly jump up this brand equity list, as the haters are going to hate, and the supporters are going to support.
Wisconsin is highly respected, but do its graduates break down and cry for the love of their school when its undefeated football team wins the Rose Bowl? Man cannot live on respect alone.
...but TCU won!
So it does pay to sue podunk high schools for using a W in the wrong font. Noted.
"Wisconsin is highly respected, but do its graduates break down and cry for the love of their school when its undefeated football team wins the Rose Bowl?"
You're suggesting football isn't a big deal to people at the University of Wisconsin?

The Altus City Planning Commission was set to meet again at 4 p.m. today in City Council Chambers for a public hearing to rezone the 1200-1310 block of N. Park Lane near Falcon Road, as proposed by owner of Falcon Terrace L.L.C., Michael K. Duffy. However, some nearby residents are opposed.
The Planning Department has recommended that City Council approve the ordinance to rezone the tract of land from a Suburban Commercial to an Auto Urban Commercial classification.
Of the 86 property owners within 300 feet of the tract, six residents have called to issue a complaint, two residents have submitted letters of opposition as well as the English Village Ownership Association, and a petition of 23 signatures have all been submitted to stop the rezoning proposal.
The tract of land, formerly a mobile home park, is also the proposed site for an air medical response team, Air Evac Lifeteam of West Plains, Mich., expected to have a helicopter pad, an office building, and an above ground fuel tank. Having a medivac would mean speedy transportation by air lift rather than ambulance to a medical facility, and also coordination with other medical teams in the area to include Jackson County EMS and Jackson County Memorial Hospital.
Those opposed to this possible outcome believe that the values of their property will go down for being in a commercially used helicopter flight path and for excessive noise during take off and landing. Having an above ground fuel tank has raised the question on safety. There is also a concern for the quality of life for nearby nursing home residents and veteran residents in the area who might suffer from PTSD.
City Council will meet tonight at 6:30 to consider this and other items on the consent agenda.

(Bumped from FanPosts. --Eric)
---
I spent most of Friday battling a stomach bug, pretty unsure whether I'd make it out to the ballpark in time to catch the Savannah Sand Gnats battle the Rome Braves. Luckily, the game was delayed slightly due to some passing showers in the Rome area so I made it before the Sand Gnats pitcher, Erik Goeddel, started warming up in the bullpen. I always enjoy watching guys work in the pen before the game. As you can see in the video that I posted below, he takes his time to gather a feel for his pitches.
Fast Forward to Game action. Erik didn't disappoint. He was seemingly in control the entire game, reaching his first 3 ball count in the 7th inning. In fact, from information I obtained from an anonymous source, this was the first game that Erik reached the 7th inning as a starter since Erik was in high school. If you don't know the story, he battled elbow injuries in high school and college, having a torn elbow ligament repaired while at UCLA. He is a tall, lanky kid who has room to grow and pack on some muscle.
Change Up: The least of his offerings, it isn't a terrible pitch. If anything, it provided Erik with a change of pace, to keep hitters off of his fastball. The arm action was okay but the difference in velocity was good.
Slider: His best offering. The movement on this pitch is unfair for the opposition. The pitch started in the zone but ending up sweeping abusively low and out of the zone. This pitch, followed by the sinker, was simply unfair to the opposition. I don't have a velocity reading for the slider but I would guess it sits in the mid 80s.
Curveball: The best single pitch thrown all evening was a Curveball to Braves prospect Edward Salcedo. The curveball to Salcedo was perfectly set up after a steady diet of fastballs. A classic 12-6 offering, Erik did not have a good feel and avoided this pitch after the second inning other than the one he spun to Salcedo. Once again, I don't have a velocity reading on this pitch. It was his slowest offering, probably registering in the high 70s.
Erik's final line was 7 innings pitched, 6 hits, 5 strikeouts, 1 HR, 1 run and no walks.
In the video posted below, you will see Erik warm up in the pen prior to the game, some warm ups before the first few innings of the game and some pitches during game action.

The information above is an updated feed of the most current Rolling Hills bundle services. This info permits users to determine recent promotions, packages and prices from available bundle suppliers within the state. What's more, it offers users the details needed to weigh Rolling Hills bundle services against U.S. averages.
The newest report states 2 companies are currently offering bundle packages in Rolling Hills, KY. Between these providers you will find a total of 31 bundle offers and 0 special offers available for purchase.
If you're looking for more information on selecting the best quality bundle service make sure you reference the article below.
Bundle Package Selections
A bundle service deal simply put is a plan that combines numerous services from one provider. There are a number of service providers that offer bundled packages, typically for less money as compared to obtaining each service independently.
The types of bundled packages you're able to choose between include:
- Phone, Broadband Internet and TV Bundles
- TV and Phone Bundles
- Internet and Phone Bundles
- High Speed Internet and TV Bundles
Needless to say, the more options you include in the bundled plan the more you're likely to save.
Receiving only a single invoice to take care of is an additional advantage of purchasing a bundled plan as opposed to numerous single services. This can be especially true in the event your service provider charges late payment fees for missed payments. Nevertheless, a bundled plan might not be the right option for you personally even when it includes special rates and the simplicity of paying just a single statement.
Points to Keep in Mind Before Buying a Bundle Service
Below are some things to consider before you sign up to get a bundled service.
- Examine your requirements to confirm you won't be purchasing services you won't really take advantage of.
- If the bundled services has a special promotional price make certain you know what amount the services cost t the completion of the introductory period.
- Will you be able to spend less on installation along with other up-front costs in the event you choose a bundled plan?
- Is there a long-term contract required? Are there any termination costs?
- Understand how the expenses per service are divided within the bundle package.
- Be sure to take into account not only the cost, but the professionalism and reputation of the service provider.
Keep in mind, if you opt to eliminate one or more of the services in the future, your provider will almost certainly increase your monthly costs for the continued services.
Locating the Best Bargains on Bundled Services
With countless digital TV, telephone and internet alternatives right now combining them as a bundled service package could possibly be the least complicated and most cost-effective way to go. Luckily, quite a few service providers have bundle service packages and a few even partner together with other providers to supply clients with services they do not currently offer themselves.
Consumers can take advantage of free search tools, for example the tool above, to find deals on bundles in their area and compare offers from major cable companies, telephone companies and internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon FiOS, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications and more.
Simply call the toll-free number or enter in your street address inside the search box above to find local service providers and the most afforable TV, internet and phone bundles in your city.

A Leadership Deficit
House-Proposed Budget Cuts Inflict Much Pain for Little Deficit-Reduction Gain
SOURCE: AP/Harry Hamburg
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other House Republicans are proposing deep cuts to key programs that help unemployed workers retrain, connect disadvantaged youth to job opportunities, provide early childhood education for vulnerable children, and offer housing and utilities assistance to seniors and disabled people.
House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI), in responding to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address, stated his belief that part of government’s role is to ensure equal opportunity, to provide a safety net, and to create conditions that allow for upward mobility. He promised the American people that these principles would inform conservative efforts to reduce the deficit.
So much for that. The House will vote this week on a spending bill to fund the government for the remainder of fiscal year 2011. This bill inflicts enormous and unnecessary pain for little deficit-reduction gain. It slashes critical investments for economic growth and does so on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.
One in three Americans, or 100 million, are scraping by on low incomes and earning less than $44,000 a year for a family of four. One in five children lives in poverty in this country, with widening racial and ethnic disparities. And last month’s dismal jobs report showed that we still have a long way to go before reaching full employment.
The Republican response to this level of distress is to ax programs in this year’s funding bill that help unemployed workers retrain, connect disadvantaged youth to job opportunities, provide early childhood education for vulnerable children, and offer housing and utilities assistance to seniors and disabled people.
Everyone agrees that America needs to tackle its long-term deficit. But the recently released Republican proposal to slash approximately $65.5 billion from last year’s domestic and international spending levels reflects a failed strategy on both economic growth and basic fairness grounds. The House Republicans are proposing deep cuts to key programs in a part of the budget that represents just one-eighth of total federal spending instead of a holistic approach that surgically weeds out wasteful spending throughout the budget and examines the tax code for special interest subsidies.
The one in three Americans struggling to get by on low incomes will bear the brunt of these irresponsible decisions.
Below are a few examples of the House Republicans’ choices, with this year’s cuts compared with last year’s level of funding. The spending bill the House will vote on this week axes among other things:
- $1.1 billion from Head Start (15 percent), which represents approximately 200,000 low-income children that would lose access to early childhood education
- $1.4 billion from various job-training programs
- $1 billion from community health centers (46 percent of regular appropriation)
- $390.3 million from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program contingency fund (66 percent cut)
- $551 million from Housing for the Elderly (67 percent cut)
- $210 million from Housing for Persons with Disabilities (70 percent cut)
Half in Ten examined these and a wide array of deep cuts and program eliminations and found that gutting programs providing basic supports to low- and moderate-income families—never mind overall cuts to infrastructure and other critical areas—saves about $15 billion. Compare this to the $23 billion we just spent in December’s estate tax giveaway to the super wealthy at the insistence of the same conservatives who want to slash these programs.
Meanwhile, at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Obama on Monday released his budget proposal for next year. He emphasized reducing the deficit while making strategic investments to help America compete and grow our economy.
The administration’s budget generally reflects the principle that we cannot outcompete the rest of the world if we are leaving one-third of our citizens behind. He requested increased funds for K-12 education, Head Start, and homeless prevention, as well as a restoration of a cut to SNAP/food stamps that had been enacted last year. To this end he also protects key investments such as nutrition assistance and housing vouchers for low- and moderate-income families even in the context of a five-year discretionary spending freeze.
But in other cases the president’s budget request falls short when it comes to protecting the vulnerable and investing in communities. His proposal disappointingly cuts Low-Income Home Energy Assistance by 50 percent and slashes the Community Services Block Grant by 50 percent. The former helps vulnerable families heat their homes in winter and cool their homes in the summer, which avoids utility shut-offs that can carry major health consequences, particularly for seniors and young children. The latter helps community action agencies in more than 1,000 localities across the country provide services such as weatherization, job training, and Head Start to more than 20 million low-income individuals.
These services both stabilize families in crisis and provide a pathway to long-term economic security. The president’s cuts in these areas are deep and painful. If the House passes them, the Senate should reject them.
Congress must pass a bill to fund the remainder of FY2011 by March 4 or risk a government shutdown. Soon after, Congress will begin the process of determining spending levels for FY2012. How do we ensure deficit reduction is accomplished in a fair and responsible manner and not on the backs of the most vulnerable?
Half in Ten proposes the following:
- Get specific. It’s easy to be in favor of slashing spending to reduce the deficit. But when it comes to specifics it’s harder for our members of Congress to justify slashing Head Start, community health centers, or housing assistance to the elderly or disabled. Contact your member of Congress and let them know these programs are important to you and your community. And let them know deficit reduction must be accomplished in a fair and balanced way.
- Put a human face on it. These cuts are fundamentally about people, jobs, and communities. Arm yourself with the data in this column and then work with Half in Ten and the Coalition on Human Needs who are collecting stories of how programs such as child care, affordable housing, and nutrition assistance have made a difference in your life, job, or community. We are looking for stories from program recipients, business owners, faith leaders, service providers, and other community leaders who can testify to the efficacy of federal programs.
- Remind your elected officials that there are alternatives. The greatest myth is that our only two alternatives are disinvesting from our communities or facing an unsustainable and spiraling mountain of debt. In reality, a number of responsible deficit-reduction proposals should be on the table that take a fair and balanced approach, invest in job creation, protect the vulnerable, and strengthen and expand our middle class. Compare the cost of the House Republicans’ devastating cuts to the price tag of December’s tax-cut extension for those earning more than $250,000 a year ($60.7 billion).
Budgets are more than just numbers on a ledger. They are statements of priorities that underscore which investments we want to make for long-term economic growth and shared prosperity. They are also moral documents that reflect the consideration we give to the vulnerable and the responsibilities we share as citizens for fairly raising revenue to pay for what we value.
Fortunately, these moral and economic imperatives coincide. Investing in human capital such as early child education, community health centers, and job training both strengthen our ability to compete on the world stage while ensuring that the American Dream remains within reach for all our citizens. It’s time to make sure our elected officials get that message.

Vol 7 No. 44 - July 25, 2007
I was having a conversation recently with a college age nephew about his future. Among other noble ambitions, he told me he wants to flip houses in his spare time. Aware that with the possible exception of myself, no one in his family was in the business of selling real estate or buying investment properties, I wondered where this particular interest came from. He told me that he watches "Flip That House." on the TLC channel. Well, that was enough to get me to tune in so I could see what I was missing.
"Flip That House" profiles individuals who purchase less than desirable properties, spend time, money and elbow grease to fix them up and resell at a profit. One of the properties highlighted was purchased for $90,000 in Columbia, S. C. The owner planned on flipping it in three weeks with a budget of $45,000.
They showed how the kitchen and bathroom were renovated, an interior wall removed and a new bathroom added. There was also a fireplace renovation, interior and exterior painting and floor refinishing. The show was interesting if a little broad in scope relative to how all this got accomplished in three weeks on a $45,000 budget.
When the renovation was complete, the house was listed for $214,500, an impressive number for three week’s worth of work. However, what they never talked about, which would have been helpful to my young nephew and future flipper, was where did the purchase and renovation money come from? They left the impression that there is money to be made in flipping, and there is, but not easily for the novice flipper.
Flipping is not for the faint of heart and definitely not for anyone who doesn’t want to spend his leisure time getting his hands dirty. Everything takes twice as long and costs twice as much as you first anticipated, and if you’re doing your flipping in a down market, you’re profits will be considerably less.
That being said, first time buyers who want to get in the game have some very attractive first time buyer financing available with little or no money down. If you live in the house for two years, fix it up and sell at a profit, there are no capital gains, as long as your profit is below $250,000 for an individual and $500,000 for a married couple. This is the best way for a young person to get started in real estate, make the initial purchase and sell for a profit without paying capital gains tax, then move on.
Savvy flippers and investors know to look for the real estate "orphans," the worst houses in the best neighborhoods. They also know how much return they will get on renovations and which renovations get the best bang for the buck. For example, kitchen renovations can have as much as a 102 percent return on cost. They also calculate having professional help in order to move the project along. The longer you hold a property and pay the mortgage, taxes, electric and other carrying costs, the less profit you receive in the end. And profits on non-owner occupied investment properties are taxed as a capital gain, cutting into the money in your pocket.
Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the show and will probably keep watching. But it makes the assumption that you are already an investor and understand all about flipping houses, which could be misleading to neophyte investors like my nephew. Like all things in life, if it sounds too easy, it is. Too bad you can’t know this when you’re 19.

The mechanical tubing market continues to be fairly good, flattening out at a relatively high plateau, but isnt nearly as tight as it was a year ago, when many mills had their customers on allocation or controlled order entry.
With additional headwinds expected to move in during the second half, most mills are leery about making predictions for 2013.
This year has been an OK year on average, with some pockets (of end-use activity) being very good and others that are not good at all, said Edward Vore, vice president of marketing and sales at ArcelorMittal Tubular Products North America.
Given that mechanical tubing demand tends to be reflective of overall industrial production and gross domestic product growth, a lot rides on what happens with the United States and global economies, he said.
The demand is still there, although a number of end-use markets are softening to a certain degree and a lot of inventories are being worked down, said Shawn Seanor, vice president of oil and gas engineered steel solutions at Timken Co., Canton, Ohio. He pointed to the Institute for Supply Managements purchasing managers index slipping below 50 percent in June, July and August as an early warning sign, especially with distributors months of supply on hand increasing, albeit slightly, over the summer.
There also has been an increase in import offerings, especially along the coasts, as a number of world markets struggle more than in the recent past and amid a strengthening of the dollar against the euro, Tim Spatafore, president of Marmon/Keystone LLC, Butler, Pa., said. But while some distributors are starting to sniff around, we wont take a chance on them. There has to be a more significant difference between the import and domestic prices before we do.
There likely will be a few months of correction ahead, Seanor said, but he is optimistic that the industry will end the year on a positive note.
Nevertheless, the significant governmental issues that have yet to be resolved make it difficult to predict what 2013 will look like for the mechanical tubing market, Vore said. A large tax increase impact or spending reduction from the full implementation of sequestration spending cuts could make 2013 a very difficult business environment, at least for the first half

, and featured some that band was dissatisfied with Tom Werman’s production; in fact, in 1998 the band went into the studio and re-recorded In Color in its entirety with — get this — Steve Albini. However, it remains unreleased, which is a shame.P). It’s a letdown. The title track is a triumph, and it rivals “Surrender” as the band’s best song — a four-minute blast of galloping power chords, with a tornado of synths, Kinks-style vocals, and arch lyrics about coked-up paranoia. But elsewhere, if falls flat. The songs are uninspired, the whole thing is overproduced, and the ballad, “Voices,” is turgid. There are strings, and some heavy-metal disco. It did well, and Dream Police was their biggest selling studio LP: the LP went to #6; the title track peaked at #26; the second single, “Voices,” went to #32.
For Cheap Trick, things started a slow, downhill slide the single,. And it was a terrible song.
Standing on the Edge (1986 Epic) was supposed to be the ol’ “return to the roots” record, but ended up having drum machines. Then it was The Doctor (1986 Epic). Sometimes it becomes difficult to continue writing these entries, once a band totally falls apart: “funk”; female back-up singers; synthesizers; computer-programmed sound effects; not much guitar.
Epic was fed up. They forced outside songwriters on the band. The result was a commercial hit and a product that would stifle the band creatively throughout the 90s. Tom Petersson rejoined the band. They had a hair ballad stuffed down their throats. “The Flame” went to #1. The CD was Lap of Luxury, (1988 Epic). It went platinum. It got bad reviews. It sold.
It’s sort of pointless to blather on endlessly about all the records Cheap Trick has made since. Sales plummeted, again; they got dropped from one major, then another. It’s really all about the first four LPs, and two tracks from the fifth.
Bands — you know, they never realize they have shelf lives, that the thing that makes a band resonate with people, and vibrate, is that they strike the Zeitgeist — and the ability to do that doesn’t last forever. They think lightning will strike over and over and over again, in exactly the same spot. Cheap Trick are still together. After Lap of Luxury, they tried to make lightning strike that spot over and over again. Of course, that spot was crass, and commercial, and artificial, and it didn’t work. They’re on an indie now. They seem to have some perspective. They’re back where they started, playing clubs. The Albini/In Color move was a stroke of genius. They should release that @#$%. They toured with Guided by Voices. Also a good move. They’re taking control of the sale of their product through digital distro. Also a good move. Go buy Budokan. It’s great.

After sitting poolside for a while we dove into the mock-rattan tepee for a more comfortable place to hide from the sun. Almost immediately I heard Joe say “oh, baby…give me your camera.” He could see what I couldn’t – the new leopard-like me! I was completely covered in the floral/spotted patterns being cast onto the mat. It was so rad.
These are just two of the images from the photo shoot that ensued. I wasn’t going to share them as I don’t exactly dream of sharing photos of me in a bikini (what up IBTC ladies!) but after giving it some thought I decided that these shadows were too cool for pride, or embarrassment. Besides, I’m practically camouflaged and they are somewhat related to this month’s mix tape: Beach Body June.
I’ve been working out almost every day since we moved and in order to fight the inevitable drag, I made this month’s mix my ultimate motivating, butt-kicking, sweat and burn soundtrack. It’s a mix of electronic, indie and rap beats that starts off mild, gets a little faster, and then mellows for a cool down. If rock is more your style then check out April’s mix – that one can really get me going! What type of music motivates you to get active?

ltcommanderdata - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - linkTo go with the smallest screen size for a modern smartphone, the iPhone 4S also has the smallest battery as shown on the first chart on page 2. It'd be interesting o find out how display power consumption scales with screen size to see if they are scaling battery size fast enough to fully compensate, but big phones with big screens do tend to have big batteries so big screens shouldn't automatically mean bad battery life. Reply
Penti - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - link4S doesn't have HSPA+ baseband only 14.0 Cat 10 HSDPA. I.e. 14Mbit "4G-branding". In short small batteries, large screens, fast processors and gpus and power hungry baseband is what drains these devices. You need a significant larger battery to have a better battery life here. For most devices that isn't a priority. For example the iPad 3 gen has a larger battery then MBAir 11. Reply
amdwilliam1985 - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - linkPlease explain the 4G part to a friend of mine.
She claims her 4G iPhone 4s with iOS 5.1.1 on AT&T network can't go through a day with moderate usage. Reply
Penti - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - linkWhat, it's just a 3G WCDMA baseband, no other radio or tech it shouldn't draw more power just because the icon says 4G in this 3.75G device. No smartphone survives more then a day with moderate usage, calls and what not. An 4s is spec'd at 8 hours talk time and 6 hours of internet use over 3G respectively. Play a game and the device is pretty much dead half day. Using apps that pull data over the wireless cellular network, talk for a few hours and play a game for 15 minutes and it should be pretty drained. If there is nothing wrong with the device then it is the usage that has to change to accommodate more battery life. If you need to talk for hours a day and be connected to chat, surf the web, use apps that leverage the internet and all that over the network you would need some solution to charge the phone over the day not matter what device you run.
Why some people whine about early LTE phones is because they had bad dual baseband chips and about half the talk time. Pretty bad battery life surfing on LTE etc. Reply
Spoelie - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - linkI'm wondering if the battery tests have ever been redone following iOS updates. In my experience, the battery life gets progressively worse with every new update. In this case, doing the tests once on release day and reusing the numbers for months on end may not be the best approach. Reply
Anand Lal Shimpi - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - linkI'll take the blame for this one. Notice the revamp of our tablet and OS X battery life tests? The smartphone web browsing test is in need of an update there as well. iOS has gotten a little too "good" at what we're doing there, at least in the web browsing test. The call and tethering tests are still great cross-platform indications of battery life. Reply
rd_nest - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - linkI think we should also look at multimedia playback times. Run high profile video files to check battery rundown time. It's an important parameter as far mobile usage is concerned.
The SGS3 (International) is getting pretty good numbers compared to US SGS3 models. Reply
yvizel - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - linkSaying 3.5'' vs. 4.3'' is not an accurate argument.
If you come to think of it, the iphone is a smaller device, therefore packs a smaller battery (as you can see in the Battery Capacity chart).
Also, I would rather have a "slower" processor and more battery juice than have an octa-core @ 4GHz on a smartphone with 1 hour of usage!
Not all of us use smartphone for gaming or whatever. I guess that the more common usage is web, email, GPS and other basic stuff. So again, no need for zillion cores on a smartphone.
Oh, and great review! looks like a great device! Reply
Connoisseur - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - linkMy point is that it's extremely difficult to compare phones of different size, resolution, screen type, OS and capacity. Even if you remove the OS out of the mix (so you can compare OS "efficiency"), the only comparison you can really make between two different devices is hours/battery capacity efficiency.
At least when comparing laptops, you have some basis for comparison (comparable hardware or form factor for example). Reply
amdwilliam1985 - Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - linkWe can do the following 2 tests.
1) Hack and put iOS on an Android device and run the same test against iPhone 4s.
2) Hack both device and put a custom OS on both and run the test.
This way we can see if it's software or hardware that's affecting the battery life. Reply

Researching Court Records.[2].[3]
The attention to detail evident in the above quote is a strong indication of a quality transcription.
Finding Compiled Court Records
As suggested earlier, an Internet search either on your home computer or at the nearest public library is the best way to get an overview of what has been published and where the published records can be found and used. Unfortunately, there is no complete bibliography of titles or websites containing compiled records. A search of the online catalog of the regional library would be helpful as would use of. Below are some suggestions about other places to look.
- Published state archives. Most of the original colonies/states authorized publication of original court records in series called archives. Such compiled volumes as Pennsylvania Archives and Maryland Archives are examples. Complete sets are available in several large research libraries and some are available online. Consult Benjamin Barnett Spratling III, "Court and Legal Records," in Printed Sources: A Guide to Published Genealogical Records, for a state-by-state (and colony) guide to compilations of this nature.[4]
- Local histories, particularly those published around the turn of the nineteenth century, may contain extracts or transcribed court records. Some are accurately reproduced with careful indexes; some have many errors. Be sure to check for appendixes, special sections of documents, and quotations in the middle of town and family sections. Early histories are becoming more accessible due to digitization, so use sites that feature these publications.
- Abstracts, extracts, indexes, and complete transcripts of court records can be found in journals, occasional publications, annual volumes, and special series. These can be accessed through a search of the Periodical Source Index, referenced in chapter 3, "General References and Guides."
- William Jeffrey Jr., "Early New England Court Records: A Bibliography of Published Materials," contains a listing of the records published, the dates covered, name of court; title, author, and bibliographic data of printed volume; description and index; brief analysis of editing done and omissions.[5]
- Evarts B. Green and Richard B. Morris, A Guide to the Principal Sources for Early American History (1600-1800) in the City of New York, contains a separate section of printed sources, including court records, found in various record depositories in New York City. They are arranged by subject and thereunder by state and locality.[6]
- Bradley Chapin, Criminal Justice in Colonial America, 1606-1660, is a valuable description of courts and their jurisdictions and specific crimes for which punishment was meted out before 1660 in America.[7] The author includes a list of selected cases and a full bibliography of early sources. Since there are no printed reports, few indexes, and missing volumes for this period, the list is especially valuable. The genealogist who is searching for an American ancestor in this early period will benefit from a careful study of this book.
- Volumes of court records have been published privately, by societies, archives, universities, and the trade press. For example, Joan W. Peters Military Records, Patriotic Service, & Public Service Claims from the Fauquier County, Virginia, Court Minute Books, 1759-1784.[8]
Finding Early Laws
It is useful to know what laws were in effect in a state at the time an ancestor lived there. Hein's Session Laws of American States and Territories: A Compilation of All States and Territories, 1775-2003[9] is the most complete coverage of all fifty states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. This is the original record of each state's legislative sessions. A companion work for pre-1775 is Colonial Session Laws, which is also published by William S. Hein and Company. Copies can be found at most major law libraries. A list of the contents of this publication, which comprises more than 88,000 microfiche, is online as of January 2006. An earlier, though still useful, collection of microfiche may be more readily available at smaller libraries: Session Laws of the American States and Territories Prior to 1900.[10] For laws not cited in full, references to the revisions in each state law code are given, providing a reference to follow the changes backward in time. The years for which printed laws are available are summarized below.
Check with state archives and historical societies for publications that provide the early laws of their respective states. One example of many is the printed work by the Historical Bureau of the Indiana Library and Historical Department, The Laws of Indiana Territory, 1801-1809. Many early references of this nature are online with searchable text, such as the Archives of Maryland's Legislative Records (1634-2000s) at or Alabama legislative records at, or H. P. N. Gammel's The Laws of Texas, 1822-1897, which consists of documents covering each congressional and legislative session and including the constitutions and early colonization laws. The first ten volumes of The Laws of Texas are available from the University of North Texas Libraries at. Some states archives assemble and publish historical laws on a particular subject. "Missouri's Early Slave Laws" (laws from Missouri Territorial to 1850s) are explained at.
Federal session laws are published at the conclusion of each session of Congress as United States Statutes at Large. This is considered the official source for the Public and Private session laws of the United States Congress. Browseable and index-searchable facsimile image files of the Statutes at Large from 1789 to 1875 are offered by the American Memory project of the U.S. Library of Congress. The earlier statutes are online at "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation".
Not only do early sessions laws help in the interpretation of court and other records researchers use, but many of these collections include what are termed private laws, such as a name change or the granting of a divorce that occurs in the early legislature of a state. Tracing the history of a law is not difficult. Most law libraries are open for public use. A call before you go can verify public access, hours of operation, availability of copy machines, and fees (if any).

Samsung Galaxy Fit
The Galaxy Fit is a low-feature Android smartphone. Its lack of features are reflected in its price, which is a good sign for the budget-minded buyer. Phones like the Fit are one of the reasons Android has taken off so quickly; allowing the people to get their hands on a smartphone for minimal cost. Although it features a 5 Megapixel camera, the Fit has only 160MB RAM and 160MB internal storage, which means limited multi-tasking capabilities. The phone’s screen is just a fraction smaller than what you’ll find on the iPhone.

What is Mobile World Congress you may ask? Basically, it’s a huge event held every year in Europe, where the top mobile technology manufacturers come together to create hype and show off their latest wares. According to Wikipedia,“MWV is the combination of the world’s largest exhibition for the mobile industry and a congress featuring prominent Chief Executives representing mobile operators, vendors and content owners from across the world.” It’s really the equivalent of CES, but for Europe. Historically, some significant developments in mobile technology have been debuted at MWC, and 2011 is looking to be no different. It really is an exciting time for Android fans worldwide! Here are our projections for Mobile World Congress in 2011.
Samsung has yet to step up to the dual core plate, and we are excited to see what they have been working on. Aside from a few teasers – which have really told us nothing, we have little in the way of confirmation of what to truly expect. Fear not reader, for we will know in just a few days. We do believe that the Samsung Galaxy S2 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 will likely both be Dual Core. Samsung’s own Dual-Core Orion chipset is supposed to eclipse NVIDIA’s Tegra 2 in terms of performance, but we will have to wait and see if this is really powering the high-end Galaxy sequels.
Specs Samsung Galaxy S2
The Samsung Galaxy S2 is supposed to feature:
If these rumors prove to be true, Samsung will easily rise to the top spot in the world of Android Phones for the beginning of 2011.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 2
A leaked itinerary for Samsung’s Sunday event also confirms that a new Galaxy Tab has been in the pipe for quite some time. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is set to be featured at MWV 2011, and there really is little in the way of cold hard facts on the ‘net as we write this article for you. Not much is known about this one – we’re hoping it’ll run Android 3.0 Honeycomb, designed for tablets, but whether it’ll stick with the same 7-inch form factor or inch up closer to the iPad’s size remains to be seen.″ Super AMOLED display, since Samsung will be able to produce such screens in mass quantities much later this year. For now we are probably looking at an LCD with Sammy’s new Super PLS technology, which can go up to 800×1280 pixels of resolution. As for 3D, that’s speculated also, but we have our doubts
The aforementioned specs show the upcoming Galaxy Tab 2 to be more muscular than either Motorola XOOM or the Apple Ipad 2. Arguably these specs would make it the most powerful tablet in world. T-Mobile has already announced the LG G-Slate tablet which will run on Android 3.0 Honeycomb. There is a lot of activity in the tablet space, and its easy to see why analysts are projecting 60 million tablets to be sold in 2011.
We’ve already seen a picture of this rumored device. It’s likely that HTC is set to make up for its lackluster release at CES 2011, in Las Vegas. The phone we have seen has been immediately labeled a successor to the HTC Desire, and it looks a lot like the HTC Desire HD, meaning that it seems to have a large screen, and a cool unibody aluminum design. The odds are good that this new HTC phone will possess Dual Core innards, but it is still too early to tell. It apparently could be packing LTE as well, and be destined for Europe and Asia. If HTC is to retain its ambitious targets of doubling or even tripling its sales worldwide, it will undoubtedly need to bring devices that offer the highest performance possible to the table. We are looking forward to seeing what they have been working on. A successor to the HTC Droid Incredible on Verizon seems to be in the works too.
HTC is also likely to be debuting its 7 inch HTC Flyer Android tablet, which, rumor has it, is single-core. Considering it should have the chipset of the HTC Desire HD, and 1GB of RAM, performance should not be an issue. There is also likely to be an HDMI port on board, which should make up for the lack of Dual Core. Additionally, It should also have a 5MP rear camera, and the prototype we heard about before was running Gingerbread. Odds are good that such a device will be debuted at Mobile World Congress 2011.
LG
The Korean manufacturer announced in a release from last week that they have a 3D Android Smartphone. dubbed the LG Optimus 3D, that will be debuted at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. LG also confirmed the fact first technical data on the smartphone. It features two separate lenses that are able to take 3D photos, which is, we guess, an interesting feature set. This special technology will also allow the user to create 3D movies and images, and the LCD will also be able to display 3D content without the need for special glasses. This is, currently, necessary for viewing current 3D TV’s. The 3D Optimus also has an HDMI port and will support the DLNA standard for wireless streaming. Unfortunately, an official photo of the Optimus 3D does not exist yet.
Motorola
Motorola already introduced its signature devices at CES 2011. These were the Motorola DROID Bionic, the Motorola Atrix, and the eagerly awaited tablet, the Motorola Xoom. It’s rumored that they will launch the devices globally on February 14th, or shortly thereafter.
Sony
To date, the rumored Play is one of the most exciting Android handsets to come from Sony Ericsson. Originally introduced in a patent almost three years ago, the PlayStation Phone has enjoyed a long history of rumors. Most of the earlier rumors only served to confirm that Sony Ericsson was working hard on a gaming-themed Smartphone. Here’s some good news – the latest batch of rumors are much more detailed, and offer a glimpse at the hardware and the software powering the phone. Even the PlayStation app has been spotted.
All the stars are lining up for the Xperia Play to be unveiled at MWC 2011. The date of MWC 2011 fits in nicely with a previous rumor that suggested the Xperia Play would be unveiled in February. A tipster for Tech Crunch leaked this February time frame and claimed the PlayStation phone provided “the best gaming [the tipster] ever had on a mobile device.” That is very high praise for a not-yet-released device. If this rumor pans out and the PlayStation Phone is introduced at MWC 2011, would you be interested in the Xperia Play?
This one offers a massive 4.2-inch screen, and also comes with some pretty significant tech packed into a very nice and stylish thin frame. The camera is running some fairly high end specs: an 8.1 MP camera with HD video recording, although it’s only offering a single LED flash, which makes sense given the frame is only 8.7mm thick at its thinnest point..
Sony claims its new ‘Reality Display’ is one, if not the, industries best, and it does offer brilliant color and extremely good refresh rates.
Think of any of these phones can top the Motorola Atrix?
Stay tuned!

I don't much feel like writing about phones this weekend. Instead, I'll paraphrase a Facebook post from an old friend of mine from high school who leads a congregation in Nebraska:
It's so easy to say, "My heart/prayers goes out." How about this: Here's the address for Sandy Hook Elementary School: 12 Dickenson Drive, Sandy Hook, CT 06482.
Take five minutes. Sit down with your kid. Write a letter. Draw a picture. Make a card. Send it to them. Tell them you're praying for them. Tell them you're so sorry they're hurting. Tell them you love them. Don't just say you love them on Facebook. LOVE them for real. ... Make your love tangible.
Wise words. Hug your kids, remember the victims. And don't ever stop trying to make this world a little better.

Could Samsung be planning to launch a full-sized tablet cousin to the Galaxy Note? Listings on Samsung's own blog, as well as a casting website, contain references to the "Galaxy Note 10.1", an as-yet unannounced device. A post with details of Samsung's Mobile World Congress 2012 developer day lists the device alongside the original Galaxy Note and S Pen SDK.
It's possible that this is a typo, however the fact that it's mentioned alongside an invitation to "experience the latest Samsung technology" suggests otherwise, as the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is almost a year old at this point. What's more, the post itself has since been pulled from Samsung's site, suggesting that the revelation may have been accidental.
The plot thickens with the discovery of a casting call for a Samsung ad by The Verge, which refers to the mysterious device multiple times. The ad was to show the Galaxy Note 10.1 "education, financial planning, and art", and was due to start shooting this month, which would tie in nicely with a possible MWC unveiling.
While of limited use on the Galaxy Note's small screen, we could see S Pen's Wacom-based abilities being much more appealing on a full-sized tablet display. Samsung has previously alluded to the possibility of stylus input on a larger display, so it wouldn't be too surprising to see a re-vamped Galaxy Tab 10.1 with S Pen integration in the near future. Whatever Samsung ends up showing at Mobile World Congress, we'll be there to bring you full coverage.

The Samsung Galaxy S2 is the successor of the immensely popular Galaxy S. At the time of its release, the Galaxy S2 was not only the thinnest android phone with a "thickness" of 8.49mm but also one of the fastest thanks to its 1.2 GHz dual-core processor. It boasts an 8 Megapixel Camera on the back and a front facing 2 Megapixel camera.
While the Galaxy S2 was launched with Android 2.3 Gingerbread - it was soon updated Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich and then updated again to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. As of June 2012, over 28 Million models have been sold, further underlining its popularity among smartphone users.
The Samung Galaxy S2 success story was only to be eclipsed by the release of the Samsung Galaxy S3 - which cemented its position as a worthy rival to the iPhone. Follow our AndroidPIT News feed for all the newest updates from Samsung for your Galaxy S2.

Natural Cleaning Products around the Household
In my last post about Installing Double Glazed Windows Can Help to Reduce Energy, I mentioned about homemade cleaning products which can keep your home nice and clean, and it got me thinking about what other ingredients could help your home fresh without having to take a trip down to your local supermarket. So it inspired me to write a little more on the subject.
When I was younger, I can remember coming home from school to walk into my house smelling of bleach everywhere. I couldn’t escape from it. The smell would burn my nose and cause my eyes to water, it was that strong. Plus my mum would only clean the house from top to bottom when she was mad, so I knew at that point, to stay out of her way.
My mum would have more cleaning products in the house than a 99p store had to offer. She had everything from spray bottles for cleaning your windows, to limescale remover for the shower. There were even some products that I never knew existed.
Strange thing was, when I would go round my grandmother’s house her house always smelled so fresh and clean, yet there was hardly any bleach around to be seen, which was a blessing for my poor nostrils.
She would always have two old dishcloths lying on the floor in the kitchen, so when she was walking around cleaning, she would step on the dishcloths and clean the floor as she went. I used to think she was as mad as a hatter, but it wasn’t until I asked her about it that she said “As I walk around the kitchen cleaning, I use the dishcloths to polish the floor as I go about.” Luckily, her kitchen floor was tiled so it made sense. If she had carpet then I would have thought she had lost the plot.
She would always have the lemon juice, vinegar and baking soda on hand to help her clean. She even had a small tub of natural beeswax to clean the big wooden table she had at the other end of the kitchen. She said that she found all the other cleaning products too harsh to use on the table. Saying that though, she didn’t mind using furniture polish once in a while, but she couldn’t use it for too long as it would irritate her skin.
I never used to mind helping her clean the house as I wouldn’t have to worry about the smell or getting bleach on my clothes and staining them.
Because vinegar naturally cleans like an all-purpose cleaner (do not use on marble and always dilute, as vinegar is acidic and can eat away at the tile grout) and the smell disappears when it dries, it’s ideal to use it in most parts of the house. It’s perfect for bathrooms, kitchens and laundry rooms. Did you know that vinegar can be used as a natural fabric softener? Nope neither did I!
Lemon juice is another natural substance that can be used to clean your home and can be used to dissolve soap scum and hard water deposits. It can be mixed with baking soda to make cleaning pastes. All you need to do is cut a lemon in half and sprinkle baking soda on the cut section. Use the lemon to scrub dishes, surfaces, and stains. You can even mix 1 cup olive oil with ½ cup lemon juice and you have a furniture polish for your hardwood furniture! How amazing is that? By doing this, you have already reduced your normal collection of cleaning products by half!
With baking soda it can be used to scrub surfaces in much the same way as commercial abrasive cleansers. It’s also a great alternative for a deodorizer instead of using those deodorizing sprays you see in adverts.
Another great household product to use is either toothpaste or mayonnaise. Why I hear you ask? Simple. If you have water marks (rings) on your wood coffee tables or wood furniture in general, then just rub a small amount of toothpaste/ mayo on the ring until it disappears and then just wipe off with a dry rag. Job done!
If you have the 3 main ingredients in your household then the possibilities for cleaning your house are endless!
Perhaps you have other great ideas about cleaning your house which won’t break the bank? Let us know and we will post them on our blog.

Great article! Most people don’t realize that you can make your own cleaning products using simple household products. It’s cheaper and so much better for the environment. I like to add essential oils to complement the effects of the ingredients, and make the solutions smell nicer too.
It’s amazing what a huge difference using natural products makes. I used to suffer from migraines and after I quit using chemicals I had a lot fewer of them. The artificial fragrances have a horrible effect on people, and I wonder how much better people would feel if they were completely cut out.
If everyone were to put more effort into doing stuff like this the world would be a cleaner place for everyone.

Hurricane Sandy Rescue Story: Yammie Safe and Sound While Dad Hard at Work
Dominic Lampasi has been working nearly non-stop since the storm hit. As a social health investigator for the Nassau County Department of Health, Dominic is one of the many heroic county workers putting in long hours helping those affected by Hurricane Sandy.
But Dominic's own home in Babylon suffered severe damage. More worrisome, his job has kept him away from his beautiful dog Yammie, a Pit Bull mix he rescued in 2005.
"Yammie has been in the dark and cold while I'm working, and I felt so horrible for her," he says. "I wanted to be able to keep working and giving aid to those who have lost their homes, but I need Yammie to be taken care of while I'm gone."
On Saturday, November 3, Dominic brought Yammie to the animal shelter at Mitchel Field gymnasium, so she had a warm, safe place to stay while he's helping others.
"She's the greatest dog, and I'm so glad to know that she will be taken care of by people who love animals as much as I do," says Dominic. "Until I'm able to take her home, she'll be fine."

On Top Of The World
By Bulldog
I am on top of the world. Why? I will tell you in a second. In a
previous article I wrote, “Fuck Everything Else,” I talked about there
being no better feeling in the world then that of accomplishing a goal
that you set for yourself. I mentioned other things like taking what is
inevitably going to be yours… Setting a goal and nailing it to the
fucking wall… Taking a dream and making it a reality… It's the best
high. Do you have that Animal lust in you? You do. If you want to that
is… Just take the first step to get there by accepting that it probably
won't be easy while remembering that you are going to accomplish your
goal no matter what. So anyway, I am on top of the world because I just
received my IFBB pro card. Fuck yeah. I feel. In the next article, I'm
going to shed some light on what a typical day in the life of me.

It’s been one thousand years since the Kingdom of Guardia was established, and to celebrate the citizens are holding a festival. Though what most people don’t know is that the night before this celebration marks the Millenial fair for the world’s monsters. After the sun has set, a portal opens and the creatures begin their own celebration, complete with various food stalls and carnival games. Two creepy critters, Nuu and Mamo, are attempting to recruit new team members, but when they prove to be unsuccessful they decide to check out the festivities instead. Whether they’re annoying the live entertainment or taking part in a drinking contest to win a golden shovel, the pair is making the most of the fiesta and plan to kick back and relax – that is until they meet a large, singing robot named Gonzalez….
Both Chrono Trigger and Di Gi Charat are graced with a peculiar, light-hearted sense of humour, as well as colourful, strange and bright characters and scenes. Chrono Trigger, though, is a bit more cheerful than Di Gi Charat, which is only really cute and cheerful on the surface. Irregardless, if you liked one, I'm sure the other could be worth your?
I think if you liked Chrono Trigger you would find enjoyment in Dragon Half as well because even though the plots are very different they share several key elements. These are both light-hearted comedies that you don't have to be serious or thoughtful to watch. They are both short so they are good for a quick laugh. Watch these as a 'pick me up' on a boring day.
For Pandy and Retro, waking up naked with amnesia wasn't the high point of their day. While going on a crime spree, the duo are captured and sent to the infamous Dead Leaves, a notorious prison where the baddest of the bad are sent. Using the bathroom is a chore, eating is force fed and escape seems impossible -- but is it? Join Pandy, Retro, the drill endowed Chinko Drill and a gang of inmates as they plot their escape from the hell that is Dead Leaves!?
If you watched Chrono Trigger OVA, then it means that you probably played the game and remember its music. Although the OP and ED in Hitohira don't have very good songs, you might find interesting the fact that the BGM in this show sounds like it was inspired on Mitsuda's and Uematsu's work (you can hear it from the very beginning of the first episode). If liked their music, you should give Hitohira a try.

Wet socks and walking polesThursday, September 22nd, 2011
Last weekend I had a sock incident in the Brecon Beacons. I was staying in Ponty Pandy’s only public house complete with bunkhouse attachment, stale nibbles and porcine landlord with pudding basin hair. Now I love a ramble, involving, as it usually does, a leisurely pace, a hot beverage with a Pppppppenguin and, if I’m lucky a wee in a bush. However, this ramble was a 20 mile Challenge in the company of a bunch of seriously dull council employees. We had a trading standards officer, a couple of widget counters and a man who did something in leisure centres – think Gordon Brittas in waterproof trousers. The day didn’t get off to a good start – the pub had no muesli, no stewed prunes, not even any Rice Crispies. It was a Welsh-all-in or nothing, so I had a slaver of black pudding on a slice of 5050 (that’s brown bread that’s been bleached white but doesn’t taste of either) then it was check you’ve got your whistle, your survival bag and your sandwiches – more slices of pig on 5050 – and we were off. From one rain-sodden tussock to another we leapt whereupon I discovered my waterproof boots weren’t waterproof at all. We then chucked up the hugely steep and perilous Pen Y Fan. En route, we passed a woman with a handbag and a shawl, and, most peculiarly, a man with strange rubber shoes with individual toes in them who’d lost the plastic end of his walking pole and had walked all the way down to the bottom to find it, saving himself, oh I’d say about 50p. Meanwhile, the council boys, fuelled by their morning sausage, had chased each other to the top and were now eating bananas and laughing like drains at the impossibly named adjacent peak of Fan Y Big. The view was lovely but on the way down, my ultra chunky wet socks started to chafe and friend A got the urge to wee. With no bushes in sight, we could either form a human shield around her with the council bores, or she could hold it until the next check point (whose facilities turned out to be a bucket in the school stationery cupboard). By this time, we’d hooked up with a Scottish Munro bagger and a building inspector from Neath who for the next two hours, regaled us with tales of altitude sickness on Kilimanjaro. By tea time, our ordeal was over. Back at the bunkhouse, we fought over the shower and who was going to have the Welsh faggots – and then we went to bed. Tidy.

Just flowering quince (chaenomeles) around town have been putting on a show now for a couple of weeks. This wonderful deciduous ornamental is just about the first thing to begin blooming in the garden each year; I have seen the quince in the photograph start to bloom in January. This is an easy plant to grow; flowering quince doesn’t seem bothered by insects, diseases (except perhaps leaf spot in the summer), or deer. If it had one drawback, perhaps, that might be the thorns. Flowering quince want full sun and, like all plants, well-drained soil. It is neat to bring branches in the house and watch them bloom during late January. The flowers make a glorious flower arrangement. The quince pictured here ( I don’t remember the cultivar) grows only about three feet tall and about five feet around. There are many, many cultivars of flowering quince available to the trade: some grow tall; others remain dwarf size. There is a wonderful assortment of colors, including coral, pink, red, white and, my most favorite, the one that sports pink and white and red blooms all on the same branch (‘Toyo Nishki’). I have been told that quince can even survive in dry shade--the gardener's worst place to get something to grow, but I have not been successful in that environment.
Flowering quince is a wonderful addition to your garden. It might almost be described as bullet-proof, a gardener’s favorite plant description.

“I stand by what I wrote in my statement,” said Andrews of his affidavit that says a fellow trooper shot Jackson after Jackson tried to take that trooper’s revolver.
Jackson’s killing on Feb. 18, 1965, by state trooper James Bonard Fowler of Geneva is widely considered to have been the catalyst for the Selma to Montgomery March, a pivotal event in the Civil Rights movement that helped bring about the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Fowler, in an interview with The Star in February 2005, admitted publicly for the first time to killing Jackson, but insisted he shot Jackson in self-defense.
Soon after that interview, the leadership of the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus called on state and federal authorities to investigate and prosecute Fowler for the shooting. Attorney General Troy King and Dallas County District Attorney Michael Jackson’s offices announced they were reviewing the case.
What happened
The 1965 incident took place inside a restaurant called Mack’s Café near the town square in Marion. State troopers had been dispatched to the area because a nighttime march had been planned by local civil rights leaders. During the march, historians and witnesses say, local law-enforcement officers, troopers and trouble-makers started beating the marchers.
In the ensuing chaos, some people sought refuge inside Mack’s Café. They were followed there by troopers, including Fowler and Andrews.
A number of historical accounts of the shooting say that Jackson was shot while trying to protect his mother from being beating by the troopers.
Andrews’ statement, which is similar to Fowler’s, says in part: “One of the Negros hit Corporal Fowler on the head with a bottle, and at the same time appeared to try and get his revolver. Corporal Fowler then threw up his arms and shoved the Negro backward, and the Negro again advanced toward Corporal Fowler, he drew his revolver and fired. Corporal Fowler shouted for someone to get a doctor, that someone had been shot.”
A number of historical accounts, including Pillar of Fire by Taylor Branch, paint a different picture of that night. In his book, Branch — referring to Cager Lee, Jimmie Lee Jackson’s grandfather, and Viola Jackson, his mother — writes: .”
Although he refused to elaborate on “anything having to do with Marion,” Andrews, 73, did make it clear that no law-enforcement agency has ever spoken to him about the case.
Looking for the truth
Fowler, in his 2005 interview with The Star, also said no law-enforcement officials had ever spoken to him about the case.
Andrews added that Montgomery attorney George Beck, who has been retained by Fowler, has not contacted him.
“You are the only person who has ever tried to talk to me about this,” Andrews said to this reporter. Then he added, “If you are looking for the truth, all you got to do is read that statement I made in 1965. That’s all the truth there is.”
After the 26-year-old Jackson was shot, he was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Selma where he died a few days later.
Andrews believes that could have been avoided.
“That young man should not have died,” Andrews said. “He died of peritonitis, an infection. That doctor didn’t know what he was doing. Now you tell me, if he would have gotten the same kind of care that George Wallace got after he got shot, do you think he would have died? I don’t,” he said referring to an assassination attempt on Wallace in 1972.
Historical accounts of the events surrounding the shooting of Jackson suggest a number of troopers, perhaps as many as 10, entered Mack’s Café just prior to the shooting.
No eyewitnesses
Andrews strongly disputes this, saying only he and Fowler and two other troopers were present.
One of the troopers present, B.J. Hoots, died a few years ago, according to the Alabama Department of Vital Statistics. A number of people in Marion were in or around Mack’s Café the night of the shooting, and dispute both troopers’ accounts of what happened the night Jackson was killed. But so far, no eyewitness other than the troopers have been found, according to Dallas County District Attorney Michael Jackson.
“If I had an eyewitness, I would be taking this before a grand jury right now,” Jackson said from his office in Selma.
Andrews, who made it to the rank of captain in the state troopers, spoke at length in the wide-ranging interview about everything from politics to his friendship with Anniston’s Norwood Hodges.
He worked, he said, for a number of years with former Gov. Albert Brewer, for example, and developed a strong admiration of him.
He talked of Brewer’s contribution to the state, and of how George Wallace sullied its image.
“Albert Brewer wanted to make Alabama a better place for its people,” he said while drinking coffee in a neighborhood McDonalds near his home in Wetumpka. “He could have been our progressive governor,” he said of the staunchly intergrationalist Brewer. “Instead we got George Wallace.
“Listen here, my youngest boy went to Harvard,” he said. “From the minute he got there, people gave him a hard time because he was from Alabama. Now that was Wallace’s fault.”

DVD Review: “Super” (2010)
In the wake of, shall we say, an interesting turn of events, Rainn Wilson’s Frank D’Arbo, who has christened himself a crime-fighting superhero called Crimson Bolt, rushes to his bathroom and throws up. I nodded. That’s how your movie made me feel too, Rainn.
Written and directed by James Gunn, Super feels a bit familiar in the beginning, even if ominous warning signs of where it will eventually go crop up continually. Wilson’s Frank is a socially awkward, geeky and devoutly religious line cook who married Sarah (Liv Tyler), a recovering drug addict, because he seemed good-willed and willing to help her keep on the right path. This doesn’t last long. She returns to drugs and turns to crime in the form of the film’s villain, Jacques (Kevin Bacon, suitably over-acting), who whisks her away. Frank goes after her. It doesn’t end well. But he doesn’t end there.
He catches a few TV episodes of The Holy Avenger, a superhero story with decidedly Christ-leaning overtones. This leads to a moment in which, more or less, Frank receives a message from God, a message that he intuits to be that it’s time to go out and kick ass and save Sarah. He goes to a local comic book shop to do research and meets the young, equally geeky but extraordinarily foul mouthed Libby (Ellen Page). She opines as to why no one has ever attempted to be superhero. Fancy that.
Frank makes himself a crimson-laden costume, fashions a seriously souped-up wrench and goes on the attack. Sort of. Even when he succeeds in beating the tar out of a drug dealer he is sloppy about it. But things get worse when he not only bludgeons an irritating man who has cut in a movie line, but bludgeons his girlfriend too. And the movie grows darker. And continues to grow darker as Libby forces her way into Frank’s existence as Boltie, the Crimson’s Bolt kid sidekick.
Still, the movie grows darker. And weirder. And unpleasant. As the movie progressed the less it came across like a twisted take on the superhero genre than a subversive commentary on mass murderers who more often than not seem deluded in the sense they are representing some sort of greater good, that they are on a mission from God, etc. If this is truly the case then Super is entirely effective. Which is why I found it so grotesque.
On The Lars von Trier Scale Of Unsettling I give Super eight out of a possible ten dog collars. The movie totally has the right to exist, I just wish I could wash the memory of its existence from my mind.

So is it literally Dwight Schrute moonlighting as the “Crimson fighter”? Seems like Wilson didn’t really have to extend that far out of his current range.
Rainn Wilson does have range. There’s a movie called Peep World where he’s really good, except that no one else likes the rest of the film but me.
There certainly are some Schrute-isms. I suspect part of the problem is many of those Schrute-isms might just be part or a variation of his real personality and so it’s difficult to do away with them unless he’s disappearing into a completely different role.
It’s pretty dark and very disturbing but this film has a moving story behind it and works as a showcase for the great talents of Rainn Wilson. Good Review Nick!
Thank you!
It had a bunch of tonal issues, and it is a very dark and disturbing film. However, on a Lars van Trier scale an 8 out of 10? No way. If Antichrist is a 10, then this movie is more like… a 4 or 5. I’ve seen far more violent and/or disturbing films.
Also, despite how disturbing this movie can get, it actually does have some good writing behind it. I still don’t know if I liked the movie or not on the whole, though.
Touché. I probably was exaggerating with the whole Von Trier Rating System but I like to exaggerate for effect. And I agree, too, that there is good writing behind it. I mean, for the most part it succeeds in what it wants to do. I don’t dispute that at all. I just personally didn’t care for what it did.
I really don’t get the appeal of Rainn Wilson at all, sorry. I think The Office is funny mostly because of Carrell but I just can’t stand Dwight, so this is definitely a skip for me.
Yeah, if you’re not a Wilson fan then you might not want to see this. In fact, you might like him even less simply because he might frighten you.
I really liked the different tone of this movie. When you start watching a superhero movie you have specific expectations of it, when it plays with those it surprises. Sure it is very dark towards the end, but I liked the fact that it wasn’t afraid to shock you and makes you believe that this guy thinks it’s ok to fight crime this way. Enjoyed it a bit more than you did.
I love it when movies don’t conform to expectations and so in that sense I certainly respect it. As I said above, I just didn’t personally care for how it upsurped those expectations.
Weirdly, I saw this on Sunday and absolutely loved it. I thought it was well done and very dark. Very violent, more than I thought it was going to be but I still very much enjoyed the show.
I normally can’t stand Ellen Page but I thought she did pretty well in this one!
Just my opinion
Well, there are other people who certainly have seemed to enjoy it, and more power to you. That’s the comparison I was trying to make with The Lars von Trier Scale. There are definitely people that enjoy his work. I’m not one of them. Just how it goes sometimes.
very interesting and unexpected review. the trailer made me want to watch it for the expected laughs, but the more I hear about the film, the more I want to not watch it.
thanks for the review!
Well, if you want to be sufficiently disturbed, I say watch it. If not…
What? You didn’t like the midnight rape? Dude getting bludgeoned with a wrench for skipping the movie theater line? What a strange movie… It definitely starts slowly but the ending is epic and there is scenes here and there that are too awesome to miss.

Over the past decade that I have served the residents of Syosset as a Town of Oyster Bay Councilman I have seen, along with the community, the untimely passing of so many fine individuals. Unfortunately, on April 7, Jeffrey Rozran, a longtime English teacher at Syosset High School and president of the Syosset Teacher’s Association, died as a result of a battle with lung cancer.
Growing up in Syosset, I was fortunate to have many fine teachers in the Syosset School District and several deserve credit for influencing my professional and personal life. Approximately 31 years ago I was especially privileged to have Jeffrey Rozran as my English teacher. From the day I met him, he had a positive influence on my life.
I was able to remain in the Syosset area and stay in touch with Jeffrey Rozran from time to time. As I was busy working as a local attorney, he embraced my career in public life and went out of his way to support me as a professional and as a public official. He was a kind and generous man and always took the time to give of himself and support others. I could tell how truly proud he was that I was one of his past students, and I was truly proud of having been taught by him and of his distinguished career at Syosset High School. I know that I share many of the wonderful feelings that so many of his former students had for him.
Jeffrey Rozran took the time to pay attention to a challenging 17-year-old high school student who would rather have been playing any sport than be in a classroom. However, his interest in me, and the rest of his students, made it easy for us to want to learn and do something positive with our lives. I always felt that he was there for me if I ever veered off-path, and he would not hesitate to pick up the telephone and steer me in the right direction.
Mr. Rozran, I will always appreciate your support and your kindness in encouraging my career. Your examples of teaching and giving will always be remembered by myself and all of the students who were fortunate enough to have had you as a teacher and mentor.
May God Bless Jeffrey Rozran and his memory, as well as his wife Luanne and his other family members. I would like people to know that I am a much better person today for having had Jeffrey Rozran as a part of my life, and for that I am truly thankful.
Town of Oyster Bay Councilman Chris J. Coschignano

I've heard from some people that the word 'Anzac' should always be spelled with capital letters, but others say it shouldn't be. What do you think about this? [NOTE - Permission is granted to the Wikipedia editor 'Hayaman' to use any or all of this material, to edit it and to post it wherever Hayaman sees fit on the Wikipedia site, attributed or not - B Dolan, 2nd April 2008).
To say that 'Anzac' should always be spelled in capitals ignores both the rules of English grammar and the word's historical usage.
I use both forms, but for different purposes. I certainly do not believe that the word should always be capitalised, for any reason.
Insisting that the word should always be capitalised is implying that everybody in the past - including the Anzacs themselves - used the term incorrectly. This is insulting.
The full capitalisation is fine so long as it is actually the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps - that is, the army formation - being referred to. However, when 'Anzac' is used as a proper noun, as in 'Anzac Cove', 'Anzac Day', or 'the Anzacs', the word does not refer to the army formation but forms one of the other six uses of the term as identified by Dr. Charles Bean in the Official History of Australia in World War 1.
The following definitions of the word 'Anzac' are from Bean, C.E.W. The Official History of Australia In The War of 1914 - 1918 Vol 1. The Story Of Anzac p 609. [I have not changed any of the capitalisation from the original].
(1) Originally, code name for Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (see p. 124) ;
(2) Name given to the beach where the A. & N.Z. Army Corps landed on Gallipoli;
(3) Official name of the two A. & N.Z. Army Corps in France (1st Anzac Corps, 2nd Anzac Corps) ;
(4) Term universally applied by British troops in France to the Australians and New Zealanders of the two Anzac Corps (the Anzacs);
(5) In Palestine, often used to denote men of the Anzac Mounted Division as distinguished from those of the Australian Mounted Division;
(6) In Australia (and eventually in the A.I.F.), used to denote Australians and New Zealanders who served on Gallipoli.
The generally accepted uses of the term are (1), (2), (3), and (6).
Clearly Bean has indicated that while originally the term ANZAC was, as is well known, a short-hand way of referring to the actual army corps, a new word - 'Anzac' - sprang from this which almost immediately evolved to have different meanings and uses.
Most authors since 1915 have used the proper noun 'Anzacs' or 'Anzac' to refer to the troops, the sector of Gallipoli and the actual cove.
It's ludicrous for anybody now to suggest that each and every one of these writers used the term incorrectly because they did not entirely capitalise it, and insulting to imply that they didn't know any better - but that 'we' do.
Consider exactly who used or uses the noun 'Anzac' :
The official Australian historian, Dr. Charles Bean;
The official British and New Zealand historians;
The Australian Imperial Force and the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in their official documents;
Those who wrote articles for the RSL in Reveille and other returned servicemen's magazines;
Those who wrote the unit histories (Australian, New Zealand and English);
Those that have written for the Australian War Memorial's Journal; the Gallipolian magazine; the Army Journal; the Defence Force Journal; the New Zealand Defence Quarterly and others.
Other authors on the subject (including French, Americans, Canadians and Turks);
All the newspapers of the day;
The Macquarie, Oxford and Collins dictionaries;
The compilers of the Imperial War Graves Commission's cemetery registers.
ALL used 'Anzac' when referring to the place, the holiday, or the men. They did not fully capitalise the proper noun because not only would that be an incorrect use of the term, it would also be incorrect use of basic grammar.
Almost every writer since 1915 has accepted that the word has different facets representing different concepts, that it is a word - a proper noun (or in some cases an adjective) - and we all (should) know that neither a proper noun nor an adjective is ever entirely capitalised.
Fully-capitalised acronyms may be used as words in order to avoid confusion with a word of the same spelling and pronunciation if that word already exists (for example PIN or AIDS - both these words - 'pin' and 'aids' already existed, so retaining the capitalisation for the new acronym helps avoid confusion). Obviously this is not the case with 'Anzac'. The word was invented in 1915, so there was no chance of confusion with an already-existing word (other examples of acronyms which evolved into nouns in the same way are 'Qantas', 'Fiat', 'scuba', 'laser' and 'radar'). The fully-capitalised acronym ANZAC refers only to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps..
To fully capitalise 'Anzac' in any of these cases is both historically and grammatically incorrect. The fully capitalised 'ANZAC' refers only to the army formation which came into existence in 1915 and which was disbanded in early 1916, and that's how I use it on this site. That's how almost every writer has used it since 1915.
From Hart's
Rules, Oxford University Press 1983:
"As a general rule, abbreviations and contractions should be followed by a full point unless the shortened form consists [entirely] of upper-case initials or is a recognized acronym pronounced as a single word: thus print BBC, HMS, OUP, PAYE, PLC, SDP, SPCK, TUC, WEA; Anzac, Aslib, Fiat, Naafi (or NAAFI). Abbreviations and contractions consisting of a mixture of upper and lower case take full points, as in I.o.W. (Isle of Wight), Bt. (Baronet), Kt. (Knight), Ltd. (Limited), St. (Street), and university degrees (D.Litt., D.Phil., Ph.D., etc.); exceptions to be made for Dr (Doctor), Revd (Reverend; not Rev), Mr, Mrs, Mme, Mlle, St (Saint); here full points are not required."
I have increasingly often seen quotes taken from Bean and other authors where those doing the quoting - either in a magazine article, on a web site, or in a book - have capitalised the word 'Anzac' when it was NOT capitalised in the original document. I can only conclude that this is done to back the author's contention that the word should always be written in capitals. At worst, this is deliberate deception, and at best, sloppy research.
Most people will never read the original documents or official histories, and it's only reasonable for them to expect to be able to trust authors to have quoted truly and accurately from them.
Following are extracts from sources
which have correctly used the word 'Anzac':
How many soldiers died at Gallipoli?
The latest figures from our colleague Patrick Gariepy, who has been working on the British Commonwealth casualties for more than ten years and who, I believe, has a more accurate count than anybody, are as follows:
* Others comprise 14 men of the Zion Mule Corps, 11 of the Greek Labour Corps, 3 Guides & Interpreters and 1 man of the Maltese Labour Corps.
These figures include deaths at Gallipoli, or those who died of disease / wounds at sea, or on the Greek island of Lemnos, in Egypt, Malta, Gibraltar or Britain (including Ireland).
Please note that the French casualty figure is not included in the above table, but is generally agreed to be approximately 10, 000.
The official Turkish figure of about 87, 000 is controversial, and the number of Ottoman dead may really be much higher.
The most consistently inaccurate figure for allied casualties, quoted in many sources, is that for the Indians. In some places (including in the Australian War Memorial), this is given as more than 7,000 - a figure far above the true number of Indian army deaths
Who were the last survivors of the Gallipoli campaign by nationality?
The last New Zealand soldier was Alfred Douglas Dibley, who served as a stretcher-bearer at Gallipoli. Born at Wellington, New Zealand, on 26 June 1896, he died at Rotorua on 18 December 1997, aged 101 years.
The last French soldier was Ernest Stocanne. He was born 6 January, 1894, and served on Gallipoli with the 17th Artillery Regiment, French Expediditionary Corps. He died in December 1999, aged 105.
The last British soldier was Percy Goring, who served on Gallipoli with the Royal Engineers, 54th (East Anglian) Division. He died in Bunbury, Western Australia,on 27 July 2001, aged 106.
The last Turkish soldier was
The last Australian soldier, and last survivor of all who served on Gallipoli, was Alec Campbell. Born in Tasmania on 26 February, 1899, he served at Gallipoli as a sixteen-year-old with the 15th Battalion. He died in Tasmania on 16 May 2002, aged 103.
Who invented the automatic-firing rifle, as used during the evacuation to make the Turks believe the positions at Anzac were still manned?
The soldier who invented the automatically-firing rifle was Lance-Corporal William Charles Scurry, of the 7th Battalion (Victoria) [later Captain, MC, DCM, MiD, 58th Battalion].
[ April 2002] After having examined documents last month, it seems that there were actually two inventors who worked on the rifle together, but that one of them did not seek credit for it. I will add the second, 'unknown' inventor's details soon.
Who invented the periscope rifle?
The soldier who invented the periscope rifle was No. 1066, Lance-Corporal William Charles B. Beech, of the 2nd Battalion (New South Wales). [later Sergeant, Divisional HQ, returned to Australia Nov 1915].
I heard a poem years ago, something about the years of the Great War being a broken song. Do you know this poem?
In his book, 'The Broken Years', about the experiences of Australian soldiers in the war, Bill Gammage writes near the end:
'So the Great War brought change to the outlook of Australians. In September 1917 an Australian soldier wrote in his diary the following memorable lines:'
This project was begun in 1985, using the 'Appleworks' database on an Apple IIe computer (with 64k of RAM). It has evolved over time to become a computer database covering all Anzac soldiers who died through their service at Gallipoli.
The records in this website are a subset of that database
- the officers only - and this is further reduced by displaying only a handful
of the FULL individual records. Though they are included in the database,
we are unable at this time to list all the Anzacs who died at Gallipoli, as
we are constrained by server memory limitations.
(Currently only those officers whose photos appear on the site have their full records also included as separate pages).

In recent days, a photo of a 100-year-old tamarind tree with branches that look amazingly like the open legs of a naked woman became an Internet sensation after appearing on the Tabloid Prodigy website, quickly getting picked up by The Frisky and Jezebel, among other sites.
The tree, which is purportedly located at a police station in Thailand's northern province of Phayao, was said to not only resemble a woman's sex organ, but also has the numbers "008" printed mysteriously on the trunk.
In most cases, a tree that resembles a female's private parts would be amazing enough, but the story goes that locals who saw the mysterious numbers chose to play them in the lottery -- and won.
The story originally appeared the Thai-language newspaper Thai Rath, but was picked up by Tabloid Prodigy from an English-language rewrite in the Phuket Gazette.
Thongphian Thammakhan, 50, the owner of a shop on the police station grounds, supposedly told the Rath that the tree is about 100 years old. She said the tree has always had the gash in the trunk but has only recently developed the shiny mound. Villagers are apparently unsure as to why the lump shines.
However, there are aspects to the Vagina Tree story that smell funny to skeptics like Richard Rubacher, an expatriate writer living in Bangkok.
"None of the locals I've spoken with have even heard of the tree," said Rubacher, who has been living and writing about Thailand since 2001. "One tourism official just laughed and said, 'It's a hoax.' "
Rubacher believes that a tree shaped like a vagina is hard to miss and says that its existence wouldn't go unnoticed in Thailand.
"On the island of Koh Samui, about 400 miles from Bangkok, there are two rock formations that resemble male and female genitalia and they are very popular -- families flock to it," Rubacher said. "So you'd think a tree like this would have been reported before."
Adding to his skepticism is the fact that the story hasn't been reported in either of Thailand's top English-speaking newspapers, The Bangkok Post and The Nation, although he said the Phuket Gazette is considered reputable.
Rubacher interviewed Songsak Wannawijit, a police official who works at the station where the alleged vagina tree is located and he adamantly denied the existence of the sex-organ-shaped tree.
"I never heard of such a tree," Songsak said, before excusing himself for a moment to look outside. "I just looked at the court yard again. The vagina tree is not there."
Rubacher said the police official insisted that news reports about the tree's existence are definitely a "gohok," the Thai word for hoax.
He added, "If anyone had won the lottery, I would have known, as this would have been big news around here."
Until the veracity of the vagina tree can be proved, fans of sex-organ-shaped trees have to focus their attention on a vagina tree in McCarren Park in Brooklyn, and that has Brooklyn boosters like The Brooklyn Paper editor Gersh Kuntzman rubbing their, uh, hands with glee.

Stamos's mother was in the audience and said she brought him home from the hospital with a bonnet covering his face. "It took about six weeks, and then he was at least presentable for a photo," she said.
Maybe he should stop sending out headshots from when he was a baby.

'The O'Neals': Ryan Still Doesn't Get How Tatum Felt Abandoned (VIDEO)
>>IMAGE.
None of that, however, can fill the void left by a father who's seemingly abandoned you without explanation. So while this road of healing is a long one, and Ryan definitely needs to start owning up a big more to the mistakes he's made, at least they seem to be on it. Maybe they'll even reach the end of it some day.

Tearing Down the House on the 'Greek' Series Finale (VIDEO)
by Jason Hughes, posted Mar 8th 2011 5:16AM
But idealism wasn't the only thing that crumbled in this finale, though don't call it sad. Despite their hopes for a miracle, the KT House wasn't spared the demolition.
But college is more than a building, and fraternity is more than a house. While showing us that you don't always win the good fight, we got to see that they all came out victorious in that they've each grown into the kinds of people they can be proud of.
'Greek' Season 4, Episode 3 Recap
Casey began her first day of classes bright eyed and bushy-tailed as usual. But in case the thought hadn't crossed your mind -- did you ever wonder how a full-fledged sorostitute like Casey Cartwright could ever be taken seriously in law school? That's right. She can't. In a storyline plucked straight from 'Legally Blonde,' Casey was ridiculed on her first day after she accidentally outed herself as the girl who got in due to a technicality. Bad move, Cartwright.
Like our favorite Harvard Law student, Casey was shunned from study groups and her ex didn't even try to stand up for her. Rude! Casey then went to complain to the professor. Seriously? The prof told her to grow a pair (well, not in those words exactly). Thank goodness ... Casey really needs to stop being so whiny and hiding herself in the home she's made for herself in ZBZ.

An Election About the Real Issues That Matter in College on 'Greek' (VIDEO)
by Jason Hughes, posted Jan 4th 2011 1:45AM
This is a college frat house, so it's not like there are big issues to debate, though a debate between the two of them espousing their particular platforms would have been incredibly entertaining.
Cappie's was all about fun: "Is it even possible to have more fun?" he asked his brothers. "I think not. Therefore, the only alternative is to have less fun. And we all know that less fun is not as fun as the fun we're already having." A well thought out argument. How would Casey counter it?
By getting to the root of what it's really all about: "If elected, I promise I will get you all laid." What more need be said? Let the first truly intellectual debate of the new year ring out. Who shall stand triumphant? And why can't they just agree that both ideas are winners?

2012 CIRP Strategic Plan and Goals
Central Goals
CIRP’s strategic plan is designed to foster implementation of a set of activities to further APA’s involvement in the promotion and development of psychology in the global world of the 21st Century and support the Association’s aspiration to excel as a principal leader and global partner promoting psychological knowledge and methods to facilitate the resolution of personal, societal and global challenges in diverse, multicultural and international contexts.
The broad goals are captured by seven program areas:
Acting in the world arena. Increasing awareness and opportunities for APA and psychology to be involved in international activities promoting human health, education and welfare, and in international policy arenas.
Fostering psychology in a global age. APA as a learning partner; building capacity.
Increasing international knowledge. Raising awareness of international activities and issues in Psychology to APA and APA members.
Expanding outward. Increasing the depth and breadth of connections among psychologists and psychological organizations around the world.
Welcoming the world. Increasing the number and engagement of APA’s international affiliates and members; working with fellow national psychology associations.
Promoting the value of cross-cultural and multicultural competence for U.S. psychologists. Integrating the study, research, and awareness of cross-cultural and multicultural issues across the Association..
Below, each goal is developed more fully; current activities in service of the goal are listed, and new activities are suggested. The first outcome of the strategic plan is the GOALS initiative.
Goal 1: Acting in the World Arena
(Increasing awareness and opportunities for APA and psychology to be involved in international activities promoting human health, education and welfare, and in international policy arenas).
Psychologists have long been active in the global arena, as visiting faculty, Fulbright Scholars, consultants and experts. Psychology as a discipline has been active in policy arenas through its global organizations (e.g., IUPsyS) and more recently individual member international organizations (e.g., IAAP, IACCP, ICP). The purpose of this goal is for APA to take a more active role through increased contacts with global organizations, and through serving as a conduit to encourage APA members to serve global organizations and to become engaged with global initiatives and activities. This might take place through more active and broad nominations, provision of commentary and expertise, and dissemination of information about opportunities.
Ongoing Activities
U.N. activities
U.N. representative team at U.N. Headquarters: involved in NGO committee structure; active in promoting psychology language and issues in U.N. statements and documents; disseminating psychology through briefings, presentations and other events in conjunction with U.N. conferences and meetings
Psychology Day at the United Nations, focusing on the contributions of psychology to issues before the U.N.
U.N. listserv (disseminate information about U.N. events to psychologists)
International meetings calendar
International conference registration grants
APA international awards
Convention programming
Guidance brochures on international exchanges, research, teaching, consultation
Collaboration with psychologists in U.S. agencies (e.g., USAID) to promote a psychological perspective in global health
Web listing of APA’s international activities
Policy Issues
APA policy on strategic response to international disasters (completed 2010)
New Activities
TBD
Goal 2: Fostering Psychology in a Global Age: APA as a Learning Partner
In the past, APA has played a large role in promoting psychology internationally; APA’s standards have been the model for standards elsewhere in ethics, curriculum development, publications. In addition APA has supported the growth of psychologists and psychology organizations worldwide through capacity building efforts and direct services.
Currently, the enormous growth in psychology programs and numbers of psychologists worldwide may require a different role in fostering the development of psychology.
Ongoing Activities
MOU program (at present, APA has MOUs signed with Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Jordan, Mexico, Norway, South Africa and the United Kingdom)
Small Grants for Program Development for National Associations (fostering capacity building for psychological organizations and psychologists)
International Affiliate Convention Registration Grants
Convention Travel Supplement Grants
Visitor’s Program for national psychology organization officers (see also Fostering Exchange)
Scientific Meeting Support Fund
Promoting regional partnerships with the Interamerican Society of Psychology (SIP), the European Federation of Psychologists’ Associations (EFPA) ; ASEAN Regional Union of Psychological Societies (ARUPS); Caribbean Region
First Street Accord (mutual recognition agreement U.S.-Canada on accreditation processes)
Policy Issues
APA Resolution on Quality Assurance in International Education and Training — APA as a Learning Partner (2009)
Participation in the development of world-wide, concensus-based standards for psychology (2012 meeting on competency models for licensing, certification and credentialing)
New Activities
TBD
Goal 3: Increasing International Knowledge
Raising awareness of international activities and issues in Psychology to APA and APA members.
The OIA and CIRP have always worked actively to disseminate information about international events, activities and perspectives. The outcomes for this goal are to continue and expand ongoing dissemination activities and to develop mechanisms to collaborate with other APA offices, Divisions and members to do so.
Ongoing Activities
Psychology International (electronic newsletter; announcements; organization profiles; country profiles; series on international collaborations; international applications of psychology)
APA International Online (website): program descriptions, meeting calendar; directories FAQ’s
Cross-Division liaisons to CIRP to promote international Division activities
Cross-Directorate meetings to raise awareness of international opportunities within APA offices
APA contributions to Psychology Around the World (PATW) web resource
United Nations research briefs on Trauma and HIV/AIDS
Regular interaction with Monitor and GradPsych Staff to promote international content in articles
New Activities
TBD
Goal 4: Expanding Outward
Increasing the depth and breadth of connections with psychologists and psychological organizations around the world.
APA, CIRP and the OIA provide more or less passive resources to facilitate interactions, such as meeting calendars, directories and the like. The purpose of this goal is to develop active outreach and matching programs to facilitate and encourage exchange at both an individual and organizational level.
Ongoing or Completed Activities
MOU program
Maintain directories of international and national psychology organizations
Small grants for program development for National Associations
International conference registration grants
International meeting calendar
Scientific meeting support fund
ROMEO experts database
Psychology Association Presidents convention program (2012 and 2007)
Fulbright Scholars – A Window to the World convention program (2008)
New Activities
TBD
Goal 5: Welcoming the World
Increasing APA membership by increasing the number and engagement of APA’s international affiliates and members; working with fellow national psychology associations
Ongoing Activities
MOU program
International Affiliates program
Convention and International Congress receptions
Convention registration awards for international affiliates and students
International Mailbox
Listserv for International Members and Affiliates
Membership recruitment drives at international conferences
New Activities
TBD
Goal 6: Promoting the Value of Cross-cultural and Multicultural Competence for U.S. Psychologists
The study, research and awareness of cross-cultural and multicultural issues must be integrated across the Association in order for APA to realize its aspiration of being a “principal leader and global partner promoting psychological knowledge and methods to facilitate the resolution of personal, societal and global challenges in diverse, multicultural and international contexts.”
Ongoing/Completed Activities
Brochure series on “Going International: A Practical Guide for Psychologists.” The first booklet, Academics Going Abroad, was published in 2011
Proposed Activities
Promulgate APA Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Training, Research, Practice and Organizational Change (2002)
Collaborate on the revision of the Multicultural Guidelines
Work to incorporate international psychology/cross-cultural competence in all levels of the curriculum
Goal 7:.
Proposed Activities
Develop strategies for showcasing the importance of international psychology to domestic research, practice and application (e.g., demonstrate relevance to local psychologists)
Encourage all APA governance activities to include international perspectives
Encourage divisions to include international presenters and presenters who have research, clinical and teaching experience outside the U.S.
Develop strategies to bring more awareness to divisions of international issues and increase APA and division international membership
Develop international talking points for divisions, including descriptions of CIRP and OIA
Promote ROMEO as resource for international expertise
Develop capacity building initiatives to support international research expertise and research expertise in countries with less developed infrastructure
Encourage increased international submissions to APA journals
Develop capacity to have abstracts translated
New Activities
TBD

Q: Several years ago, I inherited a vintage Le Corbusier L4 Chaise upholstered in ecru canvas. It's exactly like the one on display in MOMA. The trouble is the canvas has gotten quite dingy over the years, making this lovely piece look, frankly, gross. I've considered getting rid of it, but it's an authentic piece so it's probably worth hanging onto if only I could clean it up.
I've looked around online and haven't found any advice about how to clean the canvas. Anyone out there have any ideas?

Image: Via Riba Journal
If it's really vintage I'd say you probably want to have it professionally cleaned. The only other things I can think of (and I don't really know how the upholstery works on these chaises) is to put on a slipcover, or, can you take off the padded parts, store them somewhere to save them, and put replacements on the chair?
I would consult a high quality dry cleaner. Take the cushion in and see what they suggest. I imagine that the cover can be removed but they should know best which seam to open and how to restitch it.
Or, failing that, talk to an upholsterer and see what they suggest.
Since it is an original piece, your first step should be to contact The Fondation Le Corbusier. The foundation's job is to conserve and preserve Le Corbusier's legacy, so I'm sure that someone there can help you with information regarding the canvas and the particular care needed.
Just a word of warning- your encounters with furniture conservators are going to be very costly. As a painting conservator we deal with furniture conservators and man, it's a pricey venture.
I'm just jealous. Which I had a LeCorbusier to lounge upon!
Um, yeah, you're going to want to hang on to that. Seconding the recommendations for asking a professional museum conservator.
If you do end up getting rid of it, please consider donating it to a museum or foundation rather than just putting it up on Craigslist - or if you do, make sure you sell to someone who will take care of it :)
Another catch- if you do have it conserved and in turn appraised and insured, you're going to inevitably, through the effort to preserve the piece as a work of art remove it from the realm of functional furniture to a degree. Really, will you be sitting, or allow guests to sit on a piece into which you've invested several thousands which is now appraised and insured...
All I'm saying is that your actions will dictate the future life of the piece... so before doing anything, perhaps it's wise to consider what you want out of the piece...
The cushion should have a zipper or flap in the back where you can slip the foam out. Once you freed it of its foam wash it in hot water and bleach and hang it dry (so it doesn't shrink). If you can't get it out call an upholstery cleaner. It should cost about 50-100 bucks for the house call.
Slightly off-topic: I have an LC4 by Cassina that needs a new leather or pony upholstered cushion. Is there a reputable source for such a thing? I see a million and one (dubious quality) reproductions of the entire chaise, but am at a loss as to where to get a quality version of only the cushion/upholstered top.
Throw a blanket on it until you can afford to have it professionally cleaned, and if it is in that bad of shape get it reupholstered, or give it me please.

I'm a huge fan of neutral rugs. They are fabulous for providing the foundation for a room and they work with pretty much any decor. Plus, the geometric patterns make the rug even more sophisticated! I just love that Handmade Luna Moroccan Trellis Wool Rug!
#2 is actually from $73.00 - $848.00. I got excited when I thought the biggest size would only be $84 haha. Nice rugs though! #5 is my favorite.
I love neutral, and I love rugs, but this room looks bland to me. Maybe it's the ubiquitous trellis rug that is everywhere now and makes me think of a generic hotel room.
Who makes the 'parker hotel' rug? It's amazing!
I love neutral rugs too, even in colourful rooms. I once had a more colourful rug in my living room, and it not only made the room feel smaller, it drew the eye downward instead of around the room.
I love rugs! Aside from it gives a beautiful look in our room i also like the texture of the rugs on my feet. :)

Social Security’s Trial Work Period works like this: Wages below $640 (Annually Indexed, effective 2007) gross per month do not affect your benefits or count as trial work months. You are allowed one nine-month trial work period within five years. Every month you have reported earned income of $640 or above counts as one trial work month (prior to 2002 the amount was $200; for year 2002 it was $530). The nine months do not have to be consecutive but can fall within a 60 month period.
Once you use up all nine trial work months, Social Security looks at how much you earned for each month to determine if you have Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA). Social Security considers monthly reported earned income of $900 gross or above as SGA. When Social Security determines that you have SGA you will be notified that the $$ portion of your benefit will be terminated after an additional 3 month “Grace Period”.
If you earn above $640 each of your nine trial months you can keep working and not lose your SSDI $$ benefit.
If you earned below $900 each of your nine trial months and continue to work, the first month thereafter that you earn over $900 you will be notified by Social Security that you have SGA and that you will loose your $$ benefit after three months.
If you earned over $900 each of your 33 months of EPE (following your TWP and three-month Grace Period) and continue to work above $900 per month, you will be notified by Social Security that you have SGA and should not receive a $$ benefit.
If your $$ benefit is suspended during the 33 months EPE period, you can have your benefit reinstated if your income falls below $900 or you stop working within that period of time. Medicare stays in place through the nine trial months, the three-month Grace Period and the 33 month Extended Period of Eligibility (EPE). A federal law passed in 1999 continues Medicare for another four and a half years after EPE, but recipients will have to pay Part B premiums ($93.50 per month, 2007).

Basically the stuff you should be listening to if you like gaming on your iPhone
One of the most surprising effects of people upgrading to iOS 6 and those crowds buying the new iPhone is not the early adoption of Passbook. Nope. The App Store free charts are topped for once by actual apps instead of free to play games. If you didn't dismiss the dialog message straightaway, you would have noticed how the revamped App Store app on iOS 6 suggests users to download Apple's own free apps. That explains why the otherwise boring Podcasts app is number two on the charts at the time of this writing. Maybe it's a good time to talk about the iOS-centric podcasts I listen every week.
In my previous post written a year ago Podcasts for the iPhone and iPad gamer I introduced to the podcasts I enjoy most. Not surprisingly, the list is still very relevant and these shows keep going. This year I'll drop TouchGen's one, which is struggling to keep up with the rest. There's also an intriguing new addition that I hope will manage to get some following and motivation to continue with more content. Here's the list:
The Pocket Gamer iPhone gaming podcast
Directly from some place between Cambridgeshire and the Midlands in the UK — who knows — comes one of the most hilarious shows about mobile gaming you can get hold of. Pocket Gamer is a well respected publication by gamers and industry people alike, but this podcast seems like a beer-fuelled backstage chat by the people I like reading.
The most notable thing to comment is the departure of its host Will Wilson, who left his role as deputy editor to become community manager at NaturalMotion. Yes, the developer making My Horse (and CSR Racing) but also an Apple protege and regular at its keynotes. I'm hoping that Will's work replying to angry pre-teens about their virtual pets will pay off someday speaking at the Yerba Buena Center.
The task of hosting the show now falls on James Gilmour's shoulders, who is doing an excellent job so far and is bringing his own style to the podcast. The usual guests include biz-man Jon Jordan and the newcomer Peter Willington, who must be a very loveable character full of charm in real life. The soul of the show is still Keith Andrew, who insists not playing anything to talk about in the show and comments instead about video game logos — Nice logo!
The Portable Podcast
Carter Dotson is the man when it comes to interviewing iOS game developers. I don't know any other person who has talked and published more interviews than him, which should tell you the host of the Portable Podcast is more knowledgeable than your average journalist.
The format has remained similar over its 150+ episodes, with two interviews in each and some special editions with regular guests Brett Nolan from AppsAddict.net and Blake Grundman from 148Apps—the network supporting the show. This is an invaluable resource for budding developers and a total treat for gamers, as you get first hand commentary from the creators of carefully selected titles that go unnoticed at times. Needless to say, I tend to buy the games of the developers that sound like nice people.
The careful selection of interviewees also keeps away the typical spokesperson and marketing guys you get in other shows. Carter's warmth and honesty makes for a very personal interview where developers are free to promote their game but often end up talking about other interesting things.
The Touch Arcade Show
After a blazing first year and a half on air, The Touch Arcade Show just released a Rewind edition where they explain to new iPhone 5 owners what they're about. This is definitely not the most intellectual of the podcasts out there — there's plenty of swearing and silly talk — but it's definitely fun.
Hosted by the editors of the prominent website of the same title, Brad Nicholson, Eli Hodapp and Jared Nelson are an excellent mix that refine their style making the show more and more personal with every show. For the new listener it requires some catch back with past episodes as some jokes are very random, but the experience is worth it.
As Jared puts it, this is like talking to your mates about iOS gaming in case you didn't have anyone else to share your interest with… and I agree! Despite their position as a well-known site, there's a lot of criticism about shady free-to-play models and they often make fun of angry teenage readers that complain about the "high" prices of mobile games.
If you like the style, you should also check out the new YouTube channel TA plays where they comment as they play video games.
Walled Garden Weekly
The new addition on the list is also departure from the news reporting style of iOS podcasts mentioned above. This is hosted by developers Arash Keshmirian and Kevin Pazirandeh of Tower Madness, Zombie Gunship and Zombie Highway fame.
With just ten episodes I thought it was a good milestone to show appreciation to their work, making it easier for gamers to understand what goes into creating a successful title and teaching developers from their experience.
While the format tries to stick to commenting on a couple of popular games on the App Store, the show is very much freeform and the hosts end up relating with past experiences, promising to expand on certain areas in the future. I find the whole thing very informative and insightful and I'd love to hear more from them. If you would like to learn about monetization, game design, freemium strategies and even how to handle success, I recommend you download a couple of their shows.
You can subscribe to these shows and get new shows downloaded directly on your device. Apple has it's own free app but I particularly like these two alternatives:

Those yellow energy guide labels we all rely on to pick energy efficient appliances, have come under scrutiny from the US Department of Energy (DOE). As we wrote about in November, manufacturers covet the EnergyStar label and use the yellow sticker to entice buyers.
Those labels may not be as accurate as you think. A review of previous filings for the labels found instances of missing or incorrect information.
The DOE addressed the problem this month by giving manufacturers

May I suggest making a contact print of your negatives before enlarging them. This will give you a good basic exposure time/aperture which you can use to guide you in making a print from the negatives.
The time and aperture which you can best use would be found by (. . . long explanation follows . . .) setting your enlarger-head to a height where the light from the empty neg-carrier covers 10x8", with a half inch or so spare. Focus the edge of the neg-carrier sharp by eye, and double check you are still going to be covering the 10x8" paper. This size of paper is the smallest size which fits six strips of six shots of 35mm negatives - it seems from your other thread that you are using 35mm Lucky film, so it will fit on this size paper. (EDIT2: It turns out the person using 35mm Lucky film was someone else, but 120 roll in 6x6 format will also fit fine on this size of paper.)
Put the paper down, arrange the negs on top (holding them only by the edges of course) and place a piece of glass or polycarbonate-plastic (a little larger than the paper) on top to keep the negatives flat and in contact with the paper. Make your test strip with the lens stopped down to f8, so that with a grade-2 filter you can only just see the smallest possible difference between black background in the holes in the film and the 'clear' part of the negatives next to the holes. This is the beginning time for a print for an averagely well exposed negative at that contrast grade and head height. For sure it is unlikely to be the best possible time, certainly not for every shot, but it gives a good indication of what is going on with your camera-exposures and film-developing as you 'should' have recognisable images on the contact sheet. If you always follow this routine you will always have a consistent guide to which shots need more or less printing exposure or contrast, and a consistent benchmark for changing camera exposure or film development too.
The development time for the paper would usually be between one and two minutes for RC paper. Check the documentation with your paper and print-developer for the manufacturers recommendations.
Posting a shot of the contact sheet will enable further advice from the forum to be based on something visual instead of just words. That will save a lot of messing about!
Obvious first checks might be to note that you should most likely be using separate developers for the film and the print ('universal' developers exist but even with these the dilutions are very different) and that you have the paper the right way up. You can check the emulsion side of the paper by looking at the curl of it. For the RC paper I have here, Kentmere, the emulsion side is the convex side of the curve. The old test with fibre-paper would be to dampen a finger and then touch both sides to feel the difference, but Resin Coated paper seems pretty much the same front and back.
Good luck.
EDIT:
Good question from the poster above. What is your location and native language? Maybe someone can give you a quick demo, or at least a more understandable explanation.

Can you slide the tab to the left (or right - i forgot which way)?
Probably not, since it can't on my 2000 FCWs...
Back to the original problem: how does the camera behave with the back off the camera?
You see, i'm beginning to believe my original thoughts were, uhm... let's say 'misguided'. The back's status indicator not returning to white could of course be the camera's fault after all. If it doesn't transport the film, it will not change the indicator... Stupid of me.
For some reason i had the idea in my had that if the magazine's mechanism got stuck, it would block the camera's wind crank.
And it will, if stuck the right way. But it's not the only possible cause. Why i jumped to that "100%" certainty belief i can only explain as an instance of accute stupidity.
Your thoughts about the shutter not withdrawing being a sign that the camera is at fault are correct.
I thought it might perhaps be because the feeler tab was in the retraction-feature's "off" position, but the 2000 FCWs i know don't have that option. Only the 2000 FC/M had.
So perhaps another new battery after all?
Sorry for all this!

The most convenient chemical kits for reversal are made by Tetenal in Germany or other skillful chemists in EU, Those kits would not be imported in US if they are crap. The labs in Germany are not from yesterday and Tetenal are veterans in quality and skills worldwide.
DR5 as a process is great (hats down to You) but that doesn't mean everything else is crap.
This thread as far as I see it, concerns Europe.
<|endofexample|>
When I left the United States to move to Barcelona, Eheim gave me a full Aquastyle Set to make projects for them. I wanted to make a driftwood project but sadly, everything here in Europe is more expensive than in US. I finally went to the wild to collect "wood" like a cook seaching for good produce in the farmer's market. At the base of a mountain, I found thin but solid bushes that look like small trees (priceless to me).
Christmas is coming soon, so I decided to make a typical Christmas tree. I could have used a branch tied with Java moss, but then it would not have the triangle shape of a Christmas tree, so I started from the beginning, organizing the branches.
Once I had a master plan of where the branches should go, I used the electric drill to make holes in the main base of the tree then inserted the branches into the holes. (I actually tried first with crazy glue or velcro but failed.) The good thing about this method is that I could fit the branches in and out like a LEGO, until I found the right hole for each branch without damaging them.
I used velcro and zip ties to attach the main base of the tree onto the black slate rock. I admit I don't always make things look good, but I make them work. I intended to cover the base with white decorative sand so I didn't care too much about these details.
I tried to find Christmas moss from Tropica in Barcelona but it is hard to find. (Between you and I, if in the US there are 20 good stores in New York, in Barcelona there are only 3 or 4 good ones.) So I used regular Java moss, Taxyphyllum barbieri (Vesicularia).
I tied the Java moss with nylon thread on the branches, one by one; and then I inserted them in the base. This time I wanted the branches to be permanently stuck in there so I used some crazy glue on the tip.
Once I had the tree done, I considered what to do with the Riccia fluitans I had. Here in Europe we celebrate the three Wise Men, so I thought about making the Star of Bethlehem, but that is not typical in the US. So I decided to make the typical five-point star on top of the tree.
I have been rushing on this project to get it done by December 1st . So that means I used what I had handy. I work in my family business, an office supply store, so I am familiar with paper, clips, laminating plastics, etc...
I used the laminating plastic to draw the star. I cut the shape of the star and I used it as a base for the velcro. I could have tied the Riccia onto the plastic but it is better for the Riccia to grow on the velcro surface.
After the star was done I inserted it on the top of the tree with the help of a pushpin and velcro.
I still had some Riccia left and I thought I would use it to make ornaments hanging from the branches or long shiny garland along the Christmas Tree.
The ornaments didn't work out, but for the garland I used a white string (like the one IKEA gives you to tie stuff onto the car. I used some small pieces of heavy sinkers to avoid floating).
To finalize it I used white sand to recreate winter snow, with some small rocks so the arrangement looks a little more natural.
I debated whether to use small guppies or angelfish, I decided to use angelfish, because they are "angels", i.e. christmas angels, plus they match the color of the sand.
This project was not intended to make something natural like a long-term tank, this project was to make something special for Christmas. My main goal was to make a nice photo of the Christmas tree for the holidays, make it into a holiday greeting card and send it to aquatic plant friends.
If you are interested in learning about the photography, I used four lights to shoot the final photo:
1-In the background with a blue gel on it to recreate the sky (from top to bottom); the sky has to be more light on top than the bottom.
2- A "canon beam light" just for the star, in full flash power with a yellow gel on it. (The star has to look yellowish, that's why I choose the riccia in first place.)
3- A light on top facing down with a green gel on it, to give color to the tree.
4- A final light on top of the tank too, with minimal power and no gel color for the fish,
I shot the photo with tungsten settings, F/11 and 1/125, ISO 80 I think.
Well, that's all,
Hope you like it and Happy Holidays!

Abstract: Barge of Heaven: Cleopatra the Goddess
Lecturer: Alison Futrell
For Shakespeare’s Cleopatra, a yearning after immortality is the last of her many and varied carnal desires, as she abandons physical pleasures for her final self-presentation as eternal queen, her final reality in reunion with Antony. The historical Cleopatra VII, as a prominent political figure, likewise developed multiple personae to enable positive interactions with a range of audiences in the ancient Mediterranean. Her deployment of divine identities, far from the hubristic posturing of an arrogant egomaniac, sent important messages to different groups, asserting her legitimate imperial authority and structuring her engagement with major powerbrokers in Egypt, securing her realm through ritual means. She used the titles of “New Goddess” and “New Isis” to reassert dynastic claims in the Eastern Mediterranean and to present herself as an accessible and familiar agent of power, to be revered and trusted as a source of support and aid. Her notorious meeting with Antony took place aboard the barque of Isis, a venue deliberately arranged as a public demonstration of the nature of Cleopatra’s leadership. In Upper Egypt, Cleopatra acted as Thea Philopatora, the Father-Loving Goddess, reinforcing connections established by her father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, that bound her reign to elites outside the pockets of Graeco-Macedonian settlement. Cleopatra was especially concerned with the area around Thebes, a long-term node of Egyptian power and a previous focal point for resistance to the Ptolemies. Cleopatra became a highly visible participant in ancient religious traditions, such as the installation of a new Buchis bull at the Temple of Mentu in Hermonthis, when the queen herself escorted the new bovine incarnation of the god to his new home, transported with all due panoply on the barque of Amun. She also continued royal sponsorship of construction in major sanctuaries of the Thebaid, including Edfu and Dendera, where she was represented, in text, image, space and movement, performing the function of the divine ruler in Egyptian cosmology and as an agent and earthly version of Hathor, moving via ritual barge between the two sanctuaries as part of the annual Festival of Reunion. It is in this context that we should interpret the Nile cruise undertaken in 47 BCE with Julius Caesar. This was not simply a luxurious pleasure excursion, a holiday outing in sunny Egypt, but a sacred procession featuring the new divinity, queen and goddess, partner and chosen of gods.

Casa Gianna (in honour of St. Gianna Beretta Molla) hosted a session of "Duc in altum", a program for men and women who believe God has a specific calling for them and are willing to spend a day per month reflecting on that. "Duc in altum" means "put out into the deep" (Jesus' words to Simon Peter in Luke 5.4, that Pope John Paul II favoured). My theme was "Mission and Vocation", which led to a most interesting exchange.
I enjoy meeting young people of the Diocese who have a hunger for knowing God's will for their lives, especially a state in life (marriage, priesthood, consecrated life, the single state). What a gift they are: with thanks to the Salesian sisters for their accompaniment and the volunteers who do kitchen duty.

STEM students building bridges to bright futures
January 26, 2013

LOS ANGELES (Jan. 26, 2013) -- During Great Minds in STEM's Viva Technology Day at Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles, Jan. 18, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Commanding General Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Bostick delivered last-minute instructions to science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, students during the beam bridge challenge.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than half of the 30 fastest-growing occupations through 2018 are STEM-related. Environmental engineers are leading the way at an expected 31 percent job growth.
"We cannot do this without great partners," said Chair and CEO of Great Minds in STEM Ray Mellado. "The Army Corps of Engineers is the largest civil engineering organization in the world. Here in Los Angeles, we have a leader who has not only embraced this problem, but he's made it a priority for him and his people. Colonel (R. Mark) Toy (Los Angeles District commander) has been a great leader and a great partner."
In his remarks, Toy said that it is no coincidence the Corps is so dedicated to STEM and under the leadership of Bostick, that passion will continue.
"My wife is the principal of an elementary school," said Bostick. "To the principals, the educators, those who enforce discipline and education, you're really what makes this all work and we're happy to be partners. Out of 100 ninth-graders, only six will go on to pursue STEM. That's our challenge. By the year 2020, we will need a million more engineers, so we have to start early."
GMiS is USACE's partner organization for STEM. Established in 1989 as HENAAC, Great Minds in STEM is a non-profit organization that focuses on STEM educational awareness programs for students from kindergarten to career, according to their charter.
"In China, they will graduate 700,000 engineers a year," said Bostick. "We do about 70,000 in America. And, many of those engineers go back to their home countries."
Bostick and Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operations Maj. Gen. Michael J. Walsh, South Pacific Division Commander Brig. Gen. Michael C. Wehr, and his district commanders from Albuquerque, Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco, visited the school and interacted with the students.
"Dream big," said Bostick. "Our job is to mentor, to reach out to make you believe you can do anything and just reach for the stars. There is a lady, Frances Hesselbein, who earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom. President Clinton put it around her neck in the White House. She often says that, 'there are two institutions, that since the beginning of our country, have sustained our democracy, our freedom, and that's public education and the United States Army.'"
During Viva Technology Day, students participated in hands-on competitive, educational challenges. They worked in teams led by college students and Los Angeles district interns who major in STEM. USACE has three career internship opportunities: Pathways Internship Program for current students, Recent Graduates Program [2 years] and Presidential Management Fellows Program.

Tested : Rover 800 Coupé
THE Rover 800 Coupé proved once and for all that the talented styling team at Gaydon really could turn a sow’s ear into a silk purse – compare the gawky R17 saloon to any Coupé and you’ll see what we mean.
JONATHAN SELLARS tests the rarest 800 Coupé of them all, the two-litre Sterling. Does it really combine all the beauty of its more powerful stablemates without any of the drawbacks?
You smoothie…
There's no denying the 800 Coupé has style...
ROVER proudly labeled it ‘a prestigious gentleman’s carriage’, but does the Viking flagship of the Nineties really live up to the expectations fashioned by its stately looks and £30,000 price tag?
Let’s turn the clock back a decade or so. It’s 1996 and as a teenager with a fast developing fascination with all things automotive, being dragged around the showrooms as my parents test drive the new 200 series is hardly an unwelcome pursuit for me. But I’m not interested in the little bubble shaped car. My attention is drawn to the big expensive looking saloon on the other side of the showroom.
It looks just like the chauffeur-driven car the Prime Minister always pulls up in on the television, and as a rather diminutive 13-year old sitting in the giant drivers seat, surrounded by more banks of controls than an aeroplane cockpit and that rich new leather smell I’m almost left in awe. If you’d told me I’d be a Rover 800 owner by the age of 21 I’d have thought it unreal, and if the cars hadn’t already been dinosaurs by that time I might just have been right. In reality though, depreciation quickly did its stuff.
First impressions stick and when something more modern was required to take some of the strain off my 16 year-old MG Maestro as a daily commuting car, the sales brochures I’d taken back with me from that childhood showroom visit were the first to come off the shelf. I’d never really intended on owning the Coupé variant until, after two rather ill-fated encounters with saloons, a good friend mentioned to me that she was selling her pampered 1997 2-litre Sterling Coupé. With the asking price being little more than a replacement ‘KV6’ engine and the uncertainty that would go with it, I could hardly say no.
But that’s enough sentimentality. What’s the Sterling actually been like to live with over the last year?
Performance and Economy
A maximum power output of 140bhp means it lags behind the V6 and turbocharged models in the range, but it is still a lively performer, cracking the 0-60mph dash in under 10 seconds and going on to over 120mph.
Even with over 1300kg of car to pull, the 2-litre engine feels lively. There’s no shortage of torque throughout the rev range giving a respectable acceleration from rest to 60mph in just under 10 seconds and plenty of response on the move, with 30-70mph through the gears achievable in 9.2 seconds. Even at motorway speeds it’s rarely necessary to bury the pedal into the carpet to get an instant and measurable response.
Unfortunately any kind of acceleration is accompanied by more noise than one expects from a car of this class, but I have not accounted for its sole modification, a non-standard exhaust system installed by the previous owner which will have some bearing on this. I still miss the smoother power delivery and overall refinement of the V6 I owned previously. Although quite adequate for the car, the T-Series just doesn’t quite have the same feel to it leaving me wanting a little bit more at times.
The gearbox fitted to these cars has a positive feel to it, although I often find the clutch up-take is a little too sudden for smooth changes which can spoil an otherwise relaxed ride around town. Once allowed to settle at a constant cruising speed though, the Rover is at home and it really will waft along quietly and effortlessly.
A recent 1500 mile touring break provided not only an excuse to put the car through its paces on some of Britain’s toughest roads but also a chance to gauge its average economy over a long distance run. Over the three days some 207 litres of petrol were consumed (£190 worth at the time) which works out at about 31mpg. That doesn’t sound too bad, until you consider that much of the mileage was covered on motorways and fast ‘A’ roads!
Handling and Ride
The sheer size of any Rover 800 takes some getting used to. At almost five metres in length and with its wide ‘C’ pillars and long bonnet, intricate low speed maneuvering in the Coupé was never going to be easy. This is somewhat compensated for by the steering which works very well in this situation. It’s exceptionally light and effortless to turn from lock-to-lock quickly, something that also proved helpful when confronted by a notorious Lake District mountain pass involving alarmingly steep gradients interjected by an unrelenting series of hairpin bends. It is almost possible to feel a little too remote from the road at times, but Rover’s “positive centre feel” system does add a little more weight at higher speeds through the bends just where it’s needed.
On the whole the ride is comfortable and dignified, the car soaking up bumps and potholes with ease. Occasionally the limited travel of the suspension does cause it to crash around a little but in reality this only happens if, for example, you take a particularly abrupt speed bump a bit too fast. There’s a little roll through the corners coupled with perhaps ever so slight understeer, but this doesn’t seem to have too much of an adverse affect giving a reassuring feeling of poise and stability throughout.
Fast roads with sweeping bends may be very pleasurable in the Sterling, but point it at a motorway and it’s in its element. The big long body feels consistently stable at speed where in some smaller cars you often get that slightly unsettling wobble at times. There’s none of that here and it is surprising just how quickly and comfortably the miles begin to pile on with the driver barely noticing. Wind noise is certainly evident on the motorway, but not to the extent that it becomes intrusive.
At the wheel
If the Coupé looks distinguished from the outside, its interior has a certain ambience that would not have disappointed even the most discerning driver. The wood and leather formula may be a little old fashioned but it has been well executed in the Sterling giving it that distinctly English air that almost identifies a Rover. Such details as the branded door inserts, contrasting piping in the seats and even the neatly arranged rows of warning symbols at the bottom of the window glass give the car a touch of individuality. All controls (and there are a lot of them) surround the driver in comfortable reach, except those mounted on the armrest where I have visions of mistakenly jettisoning the contents of the boot instead of opening the sunroof while driving.
The armchair-like seats are great, supportive in all the right places and adjustable in every which way. Passengers often find themselves nodding off on long journeys especially in the rear compartment where they are almost completely cocooned from the world around them. There are three seats in the rear but the third is really only child sized and with all three occupied things become intimate, at best! Despite what you’d expect of a Coupé legroom is quite adequate for most throughout.
I’m convinced that stowage space inside the cabin did not come high on the list of priorities at design stage. Whilst there’s the occasionally handy Austin Rover trademark coin tray, the door bins are narrow and inaccessible, there are no cup holders, anything in the tray beneath the centre console interferes with the handbrake and the glove compartment can barely accommodate the handbook let alone anything else. If you spend a lot of time in the car, this becomes an issue.
Finish and equipment
If you’re taken in by the Sterling’s grandeur don’t look too hard for its flaws, because you won’t have to. Build quality was vastly improved in the later years and everything feels solid enough with the squeaks or rattles of earlier cars far less evident. But some of them are still there and the generally excellent finish is marred slightly by one or two cheap looking clip-on bits of plastic trim.
Being the top model equipment levels are generous as is to be expected, right down to the various different interior lights, presumably for reading your Financial Times. Rover were throwing everything at the later 800s to increase their appeal and the only option lacking by modern standards is Satellite navigation. The climate control with its rather complex 14-button control panel is a wonderful system when you learn how to use it, and particularly impressive is the 6-speaker stereo which delivers some of the best sound quality I’ve experienced in any factory standard car.
Verdict
There’s no doubt about it, the Rover 800 Coupé is an attractive car. Its elegant lines and lavish interior won it accolades from its introduction and it won’t look at all out of place in the director’s spot even today. Comfort and long distance ability are also significant strengths. With such qualities it could, and should, have been a runaway success in the US market for which it was primarily developed had it been given the opportunity.
Of course, this alone is not sufficient to make a truly great car into a class leader and comparing certain aspects of it with similarly priced rivals of the time towards which the Rover has aspirations, it is easy to see why the list price had actually fallen somewhat by 1997. But if it falls short in the detail, it doesn’t do so by far. The main problem is surely the badge. No matter how hard it tried the Rover name no longer had the kudos behind it in a highly competitive and image-conscious market to frighten the usual German heavyweights, and that’s a shame for such a worthy contender.
If you like your comforts and don’t mind sacrificing a bit of practicality, as an understated modern classic the Rover 800 Coupé has it all and now is the time to buy while they’re so affordable and relatively easy to find. It’s one of those cars you’ll find yourself glancing back at in the car park, and you’ll even want to keep on finding excuses to make long journeys for the most trivial reasons, too. That kind of appeal has to put it on anyone’s shortlist.

1a.Objectives (from AD-416).
1b.Approach (from AD-416).
3.Progress Report
The objectives of project 5310-61000-014-00D are to improve mathematical models of critical biogeochemical processes in irrigated agricultural soils and to use computer simulation to investigate alternative water and soil management practices and their effects on agricultural productivity and environmental quality. FY2011 was the final planned full year of the project. The project initiated in 2007 with 2.6 Scientists and 3.0 technical support staff. Following the retirements of 4 key personnel (2 scientists and 2 support staff), the project has been operating with 1.3 scientists and 1.0 technical support staff. Consequently, it has been necessary to prioritize milestones over the last couple of years.
In FY2011, progress was made in modeling several key biogeochemical processes, supporting national program efforts to develop decision support systems for managing degraded irrigation waters, including tools for determining the fate and transport of salts, trace elements, and pesticides. Progress includes:
1. The permeability of a porous material (such as soil or rock) is a measure of the rate at which water can flow through the material and it is a critical parameter in a number of important hydrological processes such as infiltration, flooding, erosion, evaporation, groundwater flow, and the movement of pollutants belowground. Scientists have long sought to understand how different arrangements of pores in rock or soil lead to different permeabilities. In FY2011, we developed a new theoretical pore-scale model explaining the relationship between the permeability and electrical conductivity of porous materials and demonstrated that it was more accurate than earlier models. The findings will assist researchers seeking to measure or predict permeability and related important hydrological parameters and processes. (Obj. 2C)
2. Pesticide volatilization from agricultural soils is one of the main pathways in which pesticides are dispersed in the environment. Past investigations have shown that the volatilization rate results from non-isothermal transport process in the soil and depends critically on the water content of the soil surface. In FY2011, progress was made in modeling the effects of soil moisture status on pesticide volatilization. The new knowledge may contribute to management practices which will better protect agricultural workers and surrounding communities from potentially toxic emissions. (Obj. 2B)
3. Improved mathematical models for simulating the accumulation and leaching of salts and trace elements in irrigated soils are needed to maintain productivity with degraded irrigation waters. In FY2011, extensive salt accumulation and leaching data collected over four years were analyzed and compared with model predictions. The analysis will contribute to improved predictive models and decision support tools which will allow for greater utilization of marginal quality waters. (Obj. 1A)
4. A GUI was developed for the CHAIN-2D simulation model. (Obj. 2B)
5. Due to retirements and changing priorities, HYDRUS development has been transferred to our colleagues at the university and in industry (). (Obj. 2A)
4.Accomplishments
1.
Pore-scale physics explains soil and rock properties. The permeability of soil and rock is a critical parameter affecting a number of important hydrological processes such as infiltration, flooding, erosion, evaporation, groundwater flow, and the movement of pollutants below ground. Scientists have long sought to understand how different arrangements of pores in rock or soil lead to different permeabilities. In FY2011, ARS researchers at Riverside, California used techniques from theoretical physics to develop a new model explaining permeability in terms of pore-structure and demonstrated that the model was more accurate than previous models. The findings will assist researchers seeking to measure or predict permeability and related important hydrological parameters and processes.

Technical Abstract:
L-carnitine is involved in energy metabolism and membrane function: specifically that of long-chain fatty acid transfer into mitochondria and subsequent oxidation. Although Lys and Met are its precursors for in vivo synthesis, its content in grains, of which constitute a large portion of poultry diets, is thought to be limited.
Ross 308 breeder hens were fed (beginning at 21 wk) test diets (0 or 25 mg L-carnitine/kg of diet), and progeny (via insemination with Ross males) were evaluated at 30, 35, and 37 wk of age representing Experiments (Exp)1, 2, and 3, respectively. Breeder pen was progeny experimental unit. All progeny were feather sexed at hatch. In Exp 1, chicks were placed in batteries (d 1 to 35) and treatments (16 replications with two subplots each) consisted of hen diet and progeny gender. In Exp 2, chicks were placed in floor pens (d 1 to 42) and treatments (32 replications with four subplots each) consisted of hen diet, progeny gender, and progeny diet (0 or 50 mg L-carnitine/kg of diet). In Exp 3, chicks were placed in floor pens equally by gender (d 1 to 42) and treatments (16 replications with two subplots each) consisted of hen diet and progeny diets (high or low nutrient density). Live performance and carcass traits were measured. Females had less (P < 0.05) BW gain and breast meat, but more (P < 0.05) abdominal fat and breast yield than males in Exp 1 and 2. Hen diet did not affect live performance, but hens supplemented with L-carnitine had progeny with reduced (P < 0.05) abdominal fat in Exp 3. Increasing nutrient density increased (P < 0.05) BW gain and carcass weights in Exp 3. Dietary L-carnitine (hen and progeny) increased (P < 0.05) male mortality. Additional interactive results indicated that L-carnitine in the hen diet decreased (P = 0.07) carcass fat and increased (P = 0.10) breast meat in the presence of high nutrient density. In conclusion, dietary hen L-carnitine impacted carcass traits of progeny.

Technical Abstract:
Remote sensing has facilitated extraordinary advances in modeling, mapping, and the understanding of ecosystems. Conventional sensors have significant limitations for ecological and forest applications. The sensitivity and accuracy of these devices have repeatedly been shown to fall with increasing aboveground biomass and LAI. They are also limited in their ability to represent the spatial patterns. Ecologists have long understood that the presence of specific organisms and the overall richness of wildlife communities can be highly dependent on the three-dimensional spatial pattern of vegetation. Additionally, aspects of forests, such as productivity, may be related to forest canopy structure. Lidar (light detecting and ranging) is an alternative remote sensing technology that promises to both increase the accuracy of biophysical measurements and extend spatial analysis into the third dimension (z). Multi-return Lidar sensors directly measure the three-dimensional distribution of forest canopies as well as sub-canopy topography, and therefore providing high resolution topographic maps and highly accurate estimates of tree height, cover, and canopy structure. In addition, lidar has been shown to accurately estimate LAI and aboveground biomass, even in those high biomass ecosystems, where passive optical and active radar sensors typically fail to do so. Estimation of forest structural attributes, such as LAI, is an important step in identifying the amount of water use in forest areas.

The Artcraft Company has grown to be the premiere specialty printer in New England. More corporations, law firms and financial service firms turn to us every day for their engraving and printing needs than any other printer. There are two reasons for our extraordinary growth.
First, the advent of sophisticated digital technology combined with more modern machinery has meant that engraving is no longer the time consuming and costly process it once was. In fact, it has become one of the most widely used printing methods among corporations and professionals, particularly for their corporate identity systems. We continue to invest in new technology every day. We believe in our future.
We also believe in the power of engraving. Having attributes of both form and function, engraving enhances corporate images while providing security to original documents. Providing aesthetic characteristics such as opacity, the ability to render fine lines and achieve unparalleled brilliance with metallic inks, engraving is often specified to convey professionalism and quality. In fact, many businesses, and especially law firms and financial service practices, benefit from the built-in security factor of engraving (the impression created on the back of the stock) which identifies true documents from fraudulent ones. Engraving, unlike other printing methods, is also 100% laser guaranteed.
Secondly,
our team prides itself on providing the highest level of quality and service.
Because of the exceptionally high standards the Artcraft team has set for itself,
our clients have come to expect the best: timely turn around times, friendly and
competent staff and the finest stationery available. Anywhere.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SKIN: the seduction of surfaceSaturday May 19 – Sunday September 9, 2012
SKIN: the seduction of surface opens at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia
May 18, 2012 – HALIFAX, NS – On May 19th the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (AGNS) unveils SKIN: the seduction of surface, a compelling display of contemporary art where place, race, religion, identity and sexuality are all explored and probed through physical and conceptual ideas of skin.
Drawn from the AGNS Permanent Collection, as well as from numerous international private and public collections, SKIN: the seduction of surface brings together 36 works by Canadian and international artists whose collective work explores notions of skin in paint, print, sculpture and performance.
The exhibition features Jana Sterbak’s internationally acclaimed Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic. Sterbak’s sculpture is created from 50 pounds of raw flank steak that is stitched together and hangs on a dress form. Over the course of the exhibition the heavily salted meat will decompose, cure and dry out.
Other artists whose work is included in the exhibition are:.
Sarah Fillmore, Curator of SKIN says:
“SKIN is really about layers of life: scars, protective covering, a surface, a mediator and a conveyor of identity. This show pulls works in various media together in the hopes of exploring some of the notions of skin, our perceptions of surface and the seduction and sometime revulsion of that covering. The surface begs to be scratched and I invite you to join in.”
Ray Cronin, Director/CEO says:
“Certainly Jana Sterbak’s Vanitas has sparked much debate. Raw meat sewn together to form a dress, hanging in a Gallery setting, says so much about consumption, sexuality, appetite, beauty and revulsion. I’m thrilled that the AGNS has been able to bring this iconic work to Halifax and to offer the opportunity for our visitors to come and form their own opinion.”
SKIN: the seduction of surface has been organized by the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and is curated by Sarah Fillmore, Chief Curator at the AGNS. The exhibition is accompanied by a full-colour catalogue.
Dates
Media Preview: Friday May 18th at 10.30am. A chance for media to preview the exhibition, meet the curator and several participating artists including: Jana Sterbak, Sarah Maloney, Emily Falencki, Mitch Mitchell, Doug Guildford, Cora Cluett, Janice Wright Cheney, Emily Vey Duke and Cooper Battersby.
Evening Reception: Friday May 18th at 6:30pm. Members and Invitation Only Event.
NOW OPEN LATE - New Opening Hours: As part of our mandate to make the Gallery more accessible to visitors effective May 20th the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia will be open:.

Dr. John Meadowcroft and Dr. Jaime Reynolds examine the role of Arthur Seldon (1916–2005 ) and the Liberal antecedents of the Institute of Economic Affairs.
‘I was persuaded into economic liberalism by intellectual conviction and the evidence of events and into Liberal Party sympathies because the Conservatives were too socialist and the socialists too conservative’.
‘I graduated by national insurance and state education to the LSE. There I read voraciously Lenin, Laski, Strachey, Dalton but was more influenced by Robbins, Plant and Hayek. The war and post-war siege economy, several years as editor of a trade journal, the years as an economist in industry and five years working in fruitful partnership with Ralph Harris at the IEA have reinforced the view I had acquired from a teacher that the nineteenth century was the great age of emancipation and that the classical economists were basically right.’
Arthur Seldon Capitalism (1990)
‘… we lost people from the Liberal Party who described themselves as neo-liberals of the sort of Thatcherite school. I was reading the other day that Arthur Seldon was involved in the Liberal Party in Orpington at the time of the by-election. He was typical of a certain school of Liberal who abounded in the party at that time …’
David Steel, interview in Marxism Today, October 1986
Though few Liberal Democrats would recognise him as such, Arthur Seldon was probably one of the most influential Liberal thinkers and publicists in Britain in the period from the 1950s to the 1970s. Seldon was founder Editorial Director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market think tank , which played an important role in the revival of economic liberalism that led to the global implementation of policies such as the privatisation of previously nationalised industries, the control of inflation via sound monetary policy and the application of market-oriented service regimes where public goods were provided by the state.
In the UK these policies were implemented by the Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher and its successors. This association with Thatcherism has led many Liberal Democrats to reject the notion that the ideas Seldon advocated had any connection with Liberalism. Conrad Russell, in the opening of his An Intelligent Person’s Guide to Liberalism contrasts the ‘moral’ liberalism of Roy Jenkins (of which he clearly approves) with the economic liberalism of the IEA (of which he clearly disapproves). Yet while it is true to say that Seldon’s tireless advocacy of economic liberalism had its greatest impact on the Conservative Party, rather than the Liberal Party, it is nevertheless the case that many Liberals recognised the continued relevance of economic liberalism to the Liberal cause.
Jo Grimond was a regular IEA author, contributing papers to six different IEA publications, and wrote that ‘Liberals must at all times stress the virtues of the market, not only for efficiency but to enable the widest possible choice … Much of what Mrs Thatcher and Sir Keith Joseph say and do is in the mainstream of liberal philosophy.’ Certainly, Seldon, who is now eighty-eight years old and living in retirement in Kent, always saw himself as more of a liberal, or ‘conservative radical’ than a Tory. For over three decades he was an active member of the Liberal Party and only severed his connection with the party in the 1970s.
Arthur Seldon, the Liberal Party and the IEA.
Seldon was born on 29 May 1916. He later described his tragic and poverty-stricken childhood, upbringing and education in the East End of London, as an ‘indoctrination against capitalism’. He recalled that at the age of eight in the 1924 general election, he cheered the Labour candidate for Stepney, and booed the Conservative and Liberal cars.
Seldon’s family name was Margolis, but both his parents died in the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and he was brought up by foster-parents (two of his elder siblings went to live with uncles, and two were sent to an orphanage). Seldon’s foster parents were Jewish refugees from Ukraine, whose family name Schaberdain was adopted by Arthur. His foster-father died in 1927. His foster-mother set up ‘shop’ in the front room of their East End home selling lisle stockings in order to pay the rent. The family were kept afloat by a £100 payment from a Friendly Society, paid for by his late foster-father’s weekly contributions of two shillings. For Seldon such enterprise and mutual insurance was a model of voluntary working-class responsibility and welfare that was to be replaced by state benefits and the ‘dependency culture’.
The family fortunes improved in 1931 when his foster-mother remarried (a tailor) and they moved to the relatively middle-class suburb of Stroud Green
In 1928 Seldon won a free place to Sir Henry Raine’s (Grammar) School off the Commercial Road where he was taught history in the sixth form by E. J. Hayward, a Liberal of the old school ‘whose teachings on the guild system and its replacement by industrial capitalism, with its advantages for living standards and liberties, intrigued me more than the Fabian influence of the persuasive economics master.’
Nevertheless, when he arrived at the LSE in 1934, having won a state scholarship, he seems initially to have shared the prevailing far-left attitudes of the majority of students, before joining the tiny Liberal Society. He supported the anti-Fascist protests against Sir Oswald Mosley’s march through the East End in 1936.
Seldon studied and researched at the LSE from 1934 to 1941, graduating with first class honours in economics in 1937, and then becoming a research assistant to Arnold Plant. He also studied under other liberal and Liberal academics including Hayek, Lionel Robbins, Frank Paish, George Schwartz, who kept alive free-market economics in what Seldon described as ‘the hostile anti-capitalist environment of the 1930s’. It was during his time at the LSE that Seldon Anglicised his surname, apparently following advice from Arnold Plant who thought such a change wise in the light of the rise of Anti-Semitism in Europe.
In 1937 the Liberal Party established a committee of inquiry into the distribution of property inspired and chaired by Elliott Dodds. It included Harcourt Johnstone, Sinclair’s right-hand man and expert on economic issues in the party leadership.
Plant and Robbins were approached for their advice and they asked Seldon to write a paper on the effect of an inheritance tax. This led Dodds to ask him to draft the committee’s report 'Ownership for All' which was adopted by the party conference in 1938. In Seldon’s view, ‘the proposals for the diffusion of private property rather than its replacement by public (socialised) property raised the flag of classical liberalism for the last time in the Liberal Party’. Its questioning of public ownership and proposals for selective privatisation were denounced by the Labour Party as a violent shift in the Liberal position back to laissez-faire and individualism, at odds with both Labour and Conservative thinking on the ‘socialised sector’.
Yet despite its unfashionable and ‘right-wing’ reputation, Ownership for All has stood the test of time better than many of the so-called radical tracts of the 1930s, and many of its arguments would be regarded as mainstream, if not left-wing, today. It was a radical attack on the maldistribution of wealth and property in inter-war Britain – inequalities which it described as ‘gross and shocking’. The uneven spread of property prevented equality of opportunity, wasted social resources, reduced consumer choice and menaced democracy by providing a recruiting ground for Fascism. The report rejected outright any absolute right of property and insisted on society’s right to modify laws of inheritance to reduce inequality and spread wealth.
The causes of the maldistribution of property were traced to faulty laws and policies, particularly inheritance law, lack of educational opportunity for the poor, encouragement of monopolistic industrial concentration, divorce of ownership from control of companies, and indirect taxation on wage-earners in the form of tariffs, quotas and subsidies. However Ownership for All was unusual for the times in rejecting statist solutions such as planning and public ownership; it argued unashamedly for market solutions, greater competition and the extension and permeation of property ownership throughout society. It combined a positive view of freedom and economic liberal ideas in a distinctive platform for the party:
The policy we have advocated is not one of ‘laissez-faire’. Quite the reverse. It would involve determined, and even drastic, State action at numerous points. Such action, however, would not take the form of Government control or management … Its main objects would be to create the legal structure in which a free economy can best function; to see that the market is efficient and honest; to outlaw restraint of trade; to break down unjust and artificial privileges; to preserve the national resources …; to maintain and expand the social services; and to place before all the opportunities of a full life hitherto open only to the rich. In a word, the Liberal view is that it is the function of the State ‘to create the conditions of liberty’…
While it is unclear how far Seldon’s drafts shaped the final document, it is striking that many of the arguments and much of the style of argument anticipated his later critique of state ownership and provision and his championing of markets and competition, which essentially built on the framework laid down in Ownership for All. The Liberal Party continued to use the ‘Ownership for All’ slogan into the late 1940s.
In July 1941 the Liberal Party Organisation published his pamphlet The Drift to the Corporate State, which analysed the likely effects of wartime economy measures, especially those encouraging monopoly, on the post-war economy. He was scathing about what he described as ‘the tendency in the 1930s to the formation in many basic industries of joint monopolies of employers and workers for the exploitation of consumers’.
While conceding the need for some industrial concentration and planning in time of national emergency, Seldon was blunt about the potential dangers it posed: ‘it is the corporative system of industrial organisation, which is incompatible with parliamentary democracy; it is the British variant of what in Italy is called Fascism’. Where monopoly was unavoidable (‘natural monopolies’) he argued – anticipating ideas that were novel in the 1930s but have become commonplace in recent decades – that ‘public regulation may be more suitable than public ownership [and] there would appear to be no good reason for exclusive public ownership in the public utility field, where a mixed regime of private, public, and semi-public monopolies, all equally subject to regulation by Parliament or a delegated authority would be superior’. He called for ‘State action to “cleanse” industry of its avoidable monopoly; and this will involve a more active State, a State more conscious of the conditions and consequences of monopoly …’
Between 1941 and 1945 Seldon served in the army in North Africa and Italy. He married Marjorie Willett in 1948. Her father Wilfred was a formerly devout Christian who became a communist and nature writer for the Daily Worker. Up to his death in 1961, he and Seldon would debate the issues of communism versus capitalism. Marjorie was to become an active Liberal, free trader and campaigner for education vouchers in her own right.
On his return to Britain after discharge from the army in 1946, he was drawn back into Liberal Party activity after attending a meeting chaired by Clement Davies at which Roy Harrod, the Keynesian economist, was a speaker. In 1947 Seldon was asked by Philip Fothergill to chair a committee on the aged. He consulted Beveridge whom he knew from LSE days, and who was, by the late 1940s, concerned that the expansion of the Welfare State was jeopardising the voluntary welfare movement and Friendly Societies. The committee’s report was unanimously endorsed by the Liberal Assembly in 1948.
Arthur and Marjorie Seldon were very active in the Orpington Liberal Association in the 1950s as it began the local success that culminated in Eric Lubbock’s famous by-election victory in 1962. Both of them served as president. Marjorie organised local anti-Eden demonstrations over Suez in 1956. They had three sons, Michael, Peter and Anthony, Anthony becoming the well-known political writer and biographer of John Major and Tony Blair.
For some ten years after the war, Seldon worked in industry as editor of a retailing magazine, Store, from 1946 to 1949, and then as an economic adviser in the brewing industry in an office headed by Lord Tedder, former Air Chief Marshall of the RAF, where his connections with the Liberal Party, still associated with Methodism, the non-conformist conscience and temperance, aroused some unease.
The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), founded in 1955, was the brainchild of Antony Fisher and future Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek. Fisher, like its first Director, Ralph Harris, was a Conservative – the two first met at a Conservative Party meeting – though the IEA was always non-partisan, such that when Harris was raised to the peerage by the newly elected Margaret Thatcher in June 1979 he sat as a crossbencher in the Lords. However Liberals played a major part in its early days. Oliver Smedley, a free-market zealot, a vice-president of the Liberal Party and its most vocal free-trade campaigner at assemblies in the 1950s, whom Fisher knew through the Society of Individualists, played an important role in the early formation of the IEA, providing the organisation’s first offices at his business premises (and campaigning headquarters) at 24 Austin Friars in the City of London. Other Liberals, Lord Grantchester (Sir Alfred Suenson-Taylor) and Sir Oscar Hobson were on its Advisory Board, while academics associated with the Liberal Party such as Alan Peacock and Jack Wiseman were to become active in the IEA. The IEA’s first pamphlet published in 1955, on the Free Convertability of Sterling, was written by another Liberal, George Winder.
In 1956 Arnold Plant recommended Seldon to Lord Grantchester who was trying to give the newly formed IEA ‘a liberal intellectual thrust’. Seldon was appointed Editorial Director of the IEA in 1957, a function he held until his retirement in 1981 and then again between 1986 and his second and final retirement in 1988. From 1959 he was also Executive Director of the IEA.
Seldon’s direct involvement with the Liberal Party seems to have wound down from 1957 as the IEA, seen by some potential sponsors as a Liberal ‘front’, worked to establish its non-party credentials. Nevertheless he continued to sympathise with and vote for the Liberals for another two decades. He took part as ‘an independent economist’ in a fierce debate on health and education vouchers in the party in 1966–67, speaking at a ‘Liberalism is about Liberty’ fringe meeting at the Liberal Assembly in 1966 on ‘The Welfare State and the Economy in the 1970s’. He also wrote articles in support of vouchers in the Liberal magazine New Outlook at this time. Other proponents of vouchers or a more pluralist approach to welfare included Professors Alan Peacock and Michael Fogarty, and John Pardoe MP.
The prominence in the IEA of the Liberal founders diminished in the late 1950s. Fisher and Harris found Smedley’s outspokenness a handicap in securing business funding, and with Grantchester he was gradually pushed out, although Smedley remained one of the seven ‘subscribers’ when the IEA became incorporated in 1963. Graham Hutton an ex-Fabian economist and journalist linked to the Liberals was brought in as a replacement.
Smedley, Grantchester and S. W. Alexander increasingly focused their efforts on the Free Trade Union (FTU), which they took control of following a funding crisis in 1959 (and renamed it the Free Trade League). The FTU had strong connections with the Liberal Party into the 1940s and 1950s (Sinclair and Samuel were vice-presidents). It also provided a link between post-war economic liberals like Seldon, who sat on the FTU executive from 1946, and the pre-war Liberal free marketeers such as F. W. Hirst, Sir George Paish and Vivian Phillipps. Seldon, sometimes with Marjorie, was a contributor to the FTU journal The Free Trader. After the Smedley-ite takeover in 1959, its Liberal stalwarts Sir Andrew McFadyean and Deryck Abel withdrew. Smedley, Alexander and Grantchester carried on, with a rump of like-minded, mostly Liberal, free traders and anti-common-marketeers into the 1970s. Seldon was dropped from the executive in 1959, suggesting that his sympathies did not lie with the Smedley group.
In contrast to the Smedley-ites hostility to the Common Market, Seldon seems to have taken a pragmatic approach to Europe, though he was critical of the level of subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy and the operation of monetary union. There is surprisingly little about Europe in his writings.
The Conservative party had little appeal for Seldon until the era of Margaret Thatcher. He wrote that ‘in my lifetime the Tories have enlarged state authority by fits of absent-mindedness, and my political sympathies have been Liberal, but I prefer to think of myself as a conservative radical: conservative about preserving the principles of a good society but radical about reforming the institutions required to preserve them in a world of change.’ He did not regard the Tories as a free-market party: ‘the Conservatives in general have had an indifferent record. In the 1930s they sponsored producer protection when they abandoned free trade in 1932, introduced transport licensing, agricultural marketing boards and other ‘anti-capitalist’ restrictionist policies.’
His final break with the Liberals seems to have occurred in the 1970s though Seldon is somewhat unclear exactly when. He later recalled that he ‘retained private hopes of a Liberal revival under Jo Grimond but abandoned it when he was followed in 1967 by David Steel, a party manager with little interest in policy and, it seemed, almost no understanding of economic liberalism indicated by a remark in a Marxism Today interview about my outdated laissez-faire’. However Jeremy Thorpe not Steel succeeded Grimond in 1967, and Steel did not become leader until 1976 and the Marxism Today interview did not appear until 1986. Whenever Seldon finally broke with the Liberals, he continued to claim some of their leading figures for his ideas. When he dedicated his collected writings, to the ‘politicians who rolled back the State’, he included, alongside Thatcher, Joseph, Tebbit, Powell and other Tories, the Liberals Elliott Dodds, Jo Grimond and John Pardoe.
Arthur Seldon’s liberal thought
Arthur Seldon’s political philosophy was founded upon the consistent application of the principles of economic liberalism to economic, social and political problems. Seldon’s training in classical economics at the LSE instilled in him the belief that it was only a market economy that could efficiently and fairly ration scarce resources, ensure that the benefits of economic action exceeded the costs, including the opportunity costs, and co-ordinate the actions of the many individuals and firms who constituted an advanced economy.
In Seldon’s view a market economy was able to perform this function because it utilised the knowledge communicated by prices generated in the marketplace. The price mechanism worked spontaneously without the need for a single co-ordinating body. The failure of socialism relative to capitalism could be explained by the economic chaos caused by the attempt to abolish markets and prices: ‘The use of the free-market pricing system explains the relative success of capitalism and the failure of socialism.’ The pricing system was the invisible hand of the market that led self-interested individuals to undertake actions that benefited others even if such altruistic outcomes were no part of their original intention.
He held that not only was a market economy superior in terms of efficiency, it was also morally superior to alternative economic models because it achieved economic co-ordination without the need for an over-arching political authority that directed particular individuals to undertake certain tasks or use resources in particular ways.
Seldon’s principal contribution, in his role as commissioning editor of more than 350 IEA monographs and author of twenty-eight book and monographs and 230 articles, was to apply these principles as a critique of all forms of government intervention, ranging from Marxist-Leninist state socialism to the post-war social democratic consensus, and from the provision of public goods by local authorities to national land-use planning controls. Seldon wrote:
Micro-economic analysis of the prices and costs of individual goods or services and their adjustment at the margin by individual suppliers and demanders can be no less enlightening in the public than in the private sector of the economy.
While accepting that markets were not perfect, Seldon sought to show that markets were almost always a more effective means of providing goods and services than via government dictat, and, moreover, such outcomes could be achieved without the need for restrictions on individual liberty that so often accompanied attempts to achieve similar outcomes by central direction. For Seldon there did not exist a category of public goods and a category of private goods to which different principles should be applied, rather there existed a whole range of goods and services that people wanted, but because resources were finite, some mechanism was needed to ensure the production of those goods for which demand was greatest at a cost that did not exceed the benefits. In Charge, Seldon set out his thesis that many public services would be delivered more efficiently and used more sparingly if users were required to pay for them at the point of delivery just as they did in the private sector.
Seldon’s application of micro-economic principles to the public sector led him to develop a critique of the pathologies of democratic government that anticipated the emergence of public-choice theory. In 1960, two years before the publication of Buchanan and Tullock’s landmark work The Calculus of Consent, Seldon wrote:
Representative government … at its worst … impoverishes and enfeebles the community by capitulation to articulate and persistent sections at the expense of the long-term general interest. Much so-called ‘economic policy’ can be understood only in terms of pressure from organised producers – in trade associations, trade unions or other groups.
For Seldon, the tyranny of the majority that had so concerned classical liberals such as John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville had been realised in the ability of organised minorities to extract special privileges (rents) from government at the expense of the unorganised majority. The political muscle of French and German farmers, British coal miners and American steel producers meant that through a combination of subsidy and protection these groups were allocated privileges that far exceeded the market value of their economic contribution. The result of the ability of such groups to capture the political process for their own advantage was not only the unfair transfer of resources via political means (rent-seeking), but distortions of the price system that impoverished society as a whole because it led producers to misallocate capital in response to distorted price signals.
One of Seldon’s most original contributions was his application of the principles of public-choice theory to analyse of the role of producer interests in education in the defeat of the Thatcher Government’s attempt to introduce education vouchers, a subject close to his heart. In The Riddle of the Voucher, Seldon argued that the combined power of teacher unions and civil servants in the Department of Education had prevented the implementation of a policy that was supported by ministers and many politicians, academics and parents.
Arthur Seldon and Liberal Party politics
One of the most intriguing questions of British political history is why the economic counter-revolution led by Seldon and the IEA had its greatest impact on the Conservative Party rather than on the Liberal Party. Economic liberalism had long been a cornerstone of the Liberal Party; the party had been formed from the coalition of Whigs, Radicals and Peelites united by Peel’s repeal of the Corn Laws, and the raison d’être of many of those who had kept the party alive from the 1920s to the 1950s was to preserve the spirit and natural home of free trade.
Indeed, there seems good reason to believe that in the mid-1950s the great majority of economic liberals were to be found in the Liberal rather than Conservative Party. The story of the adoption of economic liberalism by the Conservative Party is the story of how the economic liberals came into the ascendancy in that party as they were simultaneously marginalised in the Liberal Party.
While at certain elections, notably 1929 and 1945, the appeal of the Liberal Party had inclined to the centre-left, up until the 1960s the Liberal Party was still the party of economic liberalism, the open economy and free markets. It was under the leadership of Jo Grimond after 1957 that the party shifted to the centre-left, despite the fact that Grimond himself had strong economic liberal sympathies and for much of his early career was an outspoken critic of the post-war consensus from the economic right; Grimond’s political strategy of replacing Labour as the principal anti-Conservative force in British politics led him to emphasis the more ‘progressive’ aspects of party policy. This, combined with Community Politics and growing local-government strength, attracted a new generation of party supporter and activist with little sympathy for the economic liberal traditions of the party.
Grimond was succeeded by Jeremy Thorpe who had long been an opponent of the economic liberal wing of the party, but probably the crucial break with economic liberalism came with the election of David Steel as party leader in 1976. Steel, who described himself as a Keynesian Liberal, was intent on positioning the Liberal Party as the centre-left alternative to the extremes of left and right deemed to be presented by the Labour and Conservative parties. As the Liberal Party went into alliance with the SDP in 1981 and reacted against economic liberalism à la Thatcher, with its apparent rejection of much of the Liberal/Keynes/Beveridge welfare heritage, any prospects of an economic liberal revival within the party quickly evaporated.
The conversion of the Conservative Party to economic liberalism can be dated to the 1975 election of Margaret Thatcher to the party leadership. Thatcher was the leader of a relatively small faction within the Conservative Party which had long advocated the adoption of monetarist policies and greater individual freedom in the economic sphere as the solution to Britain’s relative economic decline. On election to the party leadership she set out her belief in ‘a free society with power well distributed amongst the citizens and not concentrated in the hands of the state. And the power supported by a wide distribution of private property amongst citizens and subjects and not in the hands of the state’.
It should be noted that while economic liberalism was extremely influential within the Conservative Party during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, it never achieved the level of orthodoxy that is sometimes portrayed. The early Thatcher cabinets contained a number of ‘wets’ in senior posts, while Michael Heseltine’s famous declaration as President of the Board of Trade at the 1992 Conservative conference that he would intervene in the economy ‘before breakfast, before lunch, before dinner and before tea’ was indicative of the hostility to economic liberalism that endured amongst large swathes of the Conservative Party.
Conclusion
While today the economic liberalism espoused by Arthur Seldon and the IEA is most closely associated with Thatcherism and the Conservative Party, many of the economic liberal policies pursued by the Thatcher and Major governments would have been recognised as within the mainstream of liberalism by previous generations of Liberals and by members of continental European Liberal parties. It is open to question what would have happened to the Liberal Party and to UK public policy had the economic liberal counter-revolution occurred within Liberal rather than Conservative ranks. Certainly, it may have been possible that economic liberalism could have been combined with social liberalism to form the basis of a truly libertarian movement, rather than with the social conservatism of the Tory Party. What is clear is that the long-standing practical and intellectual links between Arthur Seldon and the IEA and the Liberal Party are indisputable.

The Mayan Calendar
The famous Mayan calendar, used by pre-Columbian civilization, is a set of distinct calendars and codes, also used by other communities evolved inhabitants of Guatemala.
The calendar is extremely complex and has its own timings and connections, and from combinations referring to the elements, cycles can arise. The reasoning used for the basis of the calendar were made from systems used in the region, since the sixth century BC The formations are not uncommon in it because they had been on various calendars used by past civilizations like the Olmecs, Aztecs, and Oszapotecas Dosmixtecas.
Even the timing was not invented by the Mayan people, the greatest innovations and enhancements have been created for them.
Along with the Aztecs, the Maya civilization holds more elaborate calendars of existing and documented. There are several strands to the Mayan calendar, however, is the most important one with intervals based on 260 days and it is possibly the oldest of humanity. The Mayans had a different way to use the calendar, since they kept records of long periods of time and inscribed on the date of occurrence, all important events, to confront those that could occur. This use took the name of the Long Count, based on the days passed from one point to another.
Some situations involved were seen by the Long Count, taking account of astrology, as bleak and dangerous because of this, the battles always began in the periods that coincided with these cycles. Everything depended on the interpretation that civilization could periods.
For reasons still unexplained, some scholars or curious about it, the Internet spread the idea that the Mayans predicted the end of the world for the year 2012, when in fact what has been described is that this year is a closed cycle, were fulfilled as stipulated by day calendar calculations.
Embarking on a wave of doom, many films were released and books were sold, the money for the Hollywood film industry, including one that featured the most unusual and frightening situations for doomsday, which would be December 21, 2012.
A lot of speculation on the subject will still be around our heads, since according to the predictions can still be solar storms, giant meteor, natural disasters and many other disasters. However, there is no reason for panic, since nothing has been confirmed by serious scientists or scholars, and even those who are dedicated to the subject are not in consensus on the fact and some say that the errors are written to decipher the grotesque, reaching differences 50 to 100 years, since the Mayan calendar was translated into Latin, creating problems of interpretation.

What is Hijab, what are Hijabs and what is Hijab Fashion?
Hijab is a broad concept that refers to the idea of modesty in Islam. The term hijab in Arabic means a ‘screen’ or ‘partition’ but in everyday use, the word hijab has come to mean anything from the general idea of modesty as it pertains to Muslim women, to the actual headscarf that is worn by observing Muslim women as an emblem of their faith. A Muslim woman who dresses modestly and covers her hair is said to “observe hijab” or “practice hijab” and also referred to as a “mohajaba” or “hijabi”.
Hijabs (plural) always refers to the the Muslim headscarf . Muslim hijabs have over the centuries evolved and changed depending on many ethnic, cultural, geographic and socioeconomic factors such as who is the person wearing the hijab, where in the world the hijab is worn etc. The practice of wearing the Islamic hijab by a large number of Muslim women has resulted in the evolution of many different hijab styles with an established and thriving industry now devoted to hijab fashion.
There are many popular hijab styles in the Islamic hijab world. Let’s start with the most tailored and most convenient option (but not necessarily the most fashionable), called the Al Amira hijab. This type of Muslim hijab is sewn and pulled on over the head, is commonly made of a stretch material and can be a one piece or 2 piece Al Amira hijab. 2 piece al Amira hijabs consist of a separate underscarf that covers the hairline and keeps any hair from showing and a top piece called a buknuk that covers the head shoulders and chest. The 1 pc Al Amira is similar but the underscarf and buknuk are sewn together into one hijab that you pull over your head. Since it stays in place without pins, the al Amira is suitable for the hijabi who wants a no-fuss full coverage option, and also for students and women who are physically active and play sports.
The simplest muslim hijab option is the oblong scarf called the Shayla hijab. This is basically a simple rectangle hijab that is generously sized so the wearer (called the hijabi) can wrap it around her head in any way she wishes. Shayla hijabs probably require the most creativity but also can look the most fashionable, because there are just so many different ways you can wrap your Shayla hijabs. Shayla hijabs also give the hijabi the opportunity to accessorize her hijab with pretty hijab pins and even hijab flowers, for a pretty, feminine, more dressed up look.
For hijabis who prefer the look of the Shayla hijabs but like a hijab that offers full coverage and don’t want to spend as much time styling their hijabs, there is the in- between option, the Mona hijab. This has a tailored under cap with an attached oblong Shayla hijab. Just slip the cap on for hair coverage, and then drape your attached Shayla, and voila, you’re ready.
Like square hijabs? Then check out Turkish square hijab styles. Also more fashionable, Turkish square hijab styles are often worn with the hair formed into a high bun or pony, and with the hijab peaked at the forehead and a headband underneath to cover the hairline. This gives the hijabi a more couture look with added height and looks graceful especially with professional and career wear.

Tracy Girdler has been painting for as long as she can remember. Art is in her bloodline. Her great-great grandfather actually started Crayola as a way to help kids draw in color! Lucky to have both of her grandmother's in her life, and lucky that they were both accomplished artists, she grew up thinking of painting as just another normal activity. Due to the fact that her father was a diplomat, she also got to experience living in different parts of the world. Her suitcase full of rich memories, which she could emotionally pull from in her art, grew fatter by the year.
She'd like her paintings to speak for themselves, but understands, like all us artists do; that what's in our brain doesn't always translate perfectly onto canvas. Her paintings are the result of what she sees and feels. They aren't "pretty pictures." With each drop of paint that touches a canvas a drop of hope, of love, of life, extends from her brain to her hand. This of course means that paintings don't always turn out the way she originally envisioned.
We've all been there as artists. The canvas layers grow thick; you begin to wonder if you're trying to be Jackson Pollock; trying to be a hack; thinking that Jackson Pollock himself was a hack. Then, all of a sudden, the painting feels complete and your heart can beat again. That's how Tracy feels when she's creating art. What she pours onto a canvas isn't just paint. It's a collection of everything she's ever experienced emotionally. It's her lifeblood.
She knows though, that you the viewer are the final judge. Take a look at her work! Try to find your own meaning within them. If you succeed at that, then she's succeeded as an artist.

Hey dude. So, how was the flight? Where are you staying?
The flight, in total, was about thirteen hours, which was a kind of hell: I have to say, however, that I obviously have a less refined palette than a standup comedian, as I rather enjoyed the airline food. Perhaps that's a perk of flying with Lufthansa (who are not paying me to say this). They were showing Rock Of Ages on the plane; if I had to write a recommendation for the promotional poster of Rock Of Ages, I would like it to say "watch it kind of drunk on a plane!" - Philippa Snow, as I imagine these to be the best circumstances for it. I am currently staying in the Art Deco district, which has this swampy-aired Lynchian beauty to it, a little like people who like that sort of thing would imagine a new Lana Del Ray video to look. The Christmas decorations everywhere feel a little out-of-place.
Do you have a minibar?
No. Furthermore, the opening last night had a cash bar. Not cool, art. Not cool.
Is it hot over there, because I seem to recall you not enjoying the warmer climes so much... ? And you usually dress in black and/or fur… in fact, what on earth are you wearing?
It's balmy - vaguely tropic, but in the vein of being gently caressed by the heat rather than outright assaulted by it. I don't know if that makes sense, it's 8am here. I'm wearing, currently, sheer black stockings, black short shorts, a sheer 70s polkadot shirt (black, durr) and a big black straw hat. Everything I have is black. I walked through the park to get to the convention centre and some b-ball kids asked me if I was a ghost.
Lol. What have you seen so far?.
Lawrence Weiner, CAKE AS PIE PENDING RESOLVE, 2012; Courtesy Marian Goodman Gallery, N. Let's say you buy an individual coke bottle in America; it has more coke in it than a person needs at any one time. The difference is the difference between those bottles.
I need more sleep here than I did at Frieze, perhaps.
Basically it’s more American then. Favourite art so far?
Sadie Coles Gallery has some great work on display. Some smaller Berlin galleries with some great fanzine-y stuff as well. I absolutely fell in love with some large collage sort of things by Leigh Ledare, done with NYT headlines. A lot less creepy than the overt mummy stuff.

Most pretentious thing you've heard so far?
I saw a woman give away her passes because she felt that the class of buyer-slash-attendee was too low.
She must have seen you going in. Most clueless person you've talked to so far?
None yet, but for some reason nobody can understand my accent, which I find absolutely baffling.
Can not fathom why. Ok, I can’t resist… most horrible outfit of last night?
A girl turned up in a see through dress with big black pants underneath. "Don't look at the art, look at meeee!" Dalston in Miami.
You're there all week, aren't you? Ha, makes you really sound like a standup. Actually that’s a brainwave. You doing standup. About art. Hmm. Anyhow, what's the plan for the coming days?
There are a couple of things going on tonight - a Richard Prince party (launching, bizarrely, a drink), a Fendi/Andy Warhol thing. After that it's a lot of salon talks, gallery mooching and, I hope, consignment shopping. Bateman-style business card swapping. Mexican food.
I'm so jealous, tell me something to make me feel better.
The plane was screening Rock Of Ages. I said that already, but it bears repeating.
--Philippa Snow, Charlotte Jansen

Getting lost in Worlds is easy. The embraceable beer gut, for example, is part of a series calledThe Swimming Cities of Serenissima. It tells the story of a two-month journey taken by 30 New York artists on three homemade rafts built from salvaged materials. The group traveled from Slovenia to Venice, Italy, on the Adriatic Sea, stopping to give circus performances along the way.
In another corner of the gallery sits “The Golden Gate 1”―an egg-shaped, wooden mobile home. There’s a surfboard mounted to the roof, while the inside packs a bed, storage, a kitchen stove, a sink and a toilet. Through the cockpit window, you can see a small steering wheel with an iPod Touch embedded in its center. Designer Jay Nelson's original concept sketches ride tandem to the sculpture/vehicle. “The Golden Gate 1” has a 10-mile traveling range, with a top speed of 20 miles an hour―yet the surprisingly compact craft hovers on wheels barely bigger than a bicycle's.
Then there’s 1013 First Street, a house built in 1903, then purchased and renovated by Albuquerque artist Justin Bagley in 2002. Bagley completely repaired the run-down house with salvaged materials and has lived there since―without gas or hot water. An old TV in the gallery plays a video of his handiwork in progress, and a photo album gives glimpses of inside of the house, decorated beautifully with handmade floors and antique furnishings. On the wall beside the album are hundreds of scraps of paper with sketches, measurements and scribbled notes.
The salvage theme carries into Jed Lind’s Small is Beautifulseries. He photographed houses from the Shetland Islands, off the northernmost coast of Scotland, where harsh weather and a lack of building materials means that many houses have old boat keels for roofs. Across the Great Divideoccupies the upstairs gallery and spans 1969 to 1977, during which time Roberta Price took more than 3,000 photos. Most are of relaxed, happy-looking hippies in the Southwest. In one, a hatchet-bearing man wearing nothing but white socks and boots is on his way to chop wood. Another bears the caption “Smokes thoughtfully while contemplating a Tarot reading.” There’s also a shot of “Further,” the bus that transported author Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters across the country, outside of Santa Fe in 1969. Echoing the Shetland houses a floor below, the Drop City Commune dome complex, outside of Trinidad, Colo., was built using hoods scavenged from old cars at a junkyard. There’s also a shot of “Further,” the bus that transported author Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters across the country, outside of Santa Fe in 1969.
In sharp contrast to these halcyon scenes are Price’s photographs of the October 1969 antiwar march on Washington. In one image, smiling protesters gather for the march. In another, a police officer leans against a cement wall next to a peace sign drawn in chalk. There's tension in the diptych, a brewing storm of idealism and force that would ultimately end in tear gas. The photos in Across the Great Divide look more like family snapshots than an art gallery exhibition, which suits the subject matter well. Worlds Outside This One, however, is what will keep you at the gallery longest, as each structure, photo and piece of ephemera invites a more personal sort of interaction. The two 516 exhibits blend worlds both known and unfamiliar, and both are worth exploring.

Audiologists require the knowledge, desire, and discipline to identify potential ethical violations. Professional organizations and credentialing bodies in audiology typically require a commitment to follow their professional code(s) as a requirement for maintaining membership or a credential (Shinn, 2004). Some practitioners know about the ASHA Code of Ethics while others are familiar with their state board of examiners' code of conduct or ethics; it is important for all practitioners to be well versed with both sources of professional obligations.
Gaining and maintaining that knowledge takes a desire to learn and the discipline to follow through on ethical queries. Because ethics is so important in health care, most hospitals and health care organizations have created and published their own codes of ethics for their staff—another source of standards that practitioners cannot overlook (Kummer & Turner, 2011). Thus, most audiologists are subject simultaneously to multiple standards of professional conduct; standards that can and do overlap. Not surprisingly, professional ethics standards also tend to change over time. For instance, the Code of Ethics of ASHA was first issued in 1930, and it has been amended several times since then.
Uniformity among state board of examiners' codes of conduct and ASHA's Code of Ethics could ease practitioners' burden in becoming familiar with and staying abreast of multiple, overlapping professional obligations. Unfortunately, though increased uniformity is desirable, it is not the reality.
The dissimilarity among state codes is significant, even though most states with licensure laws have professional conduct standards based on ASHA's Code of Ethics. While some states initially adopted ASHA's Code of Ethics in whole or in large part, many deviated over time. That occurred presumably because of political or practical realities or failure to update state codes when ASHA updated its code. The end result for most practitioners is the challenging task of learning and applying multiple, sometimes inconsistent ethics rules, codes, and standards.
A survey of four randomly selected state boards of examiners' codes demonstrates the variation among the professional codes and conduct rules of state licensing boards that apply to speech-language pathologists and audiologists. In this article, I will compare and contrast the state conduct rules and codes in Delaware, Ohio, Maryland, and Mississippi and reference the current ASHA Code of Ethics (2010).
For the purposes of illustration, I will examine four common areas of ethical discourse in each code of ethics or conduct rules—
This article is only a brief snapshot of some provisions in these selected codes; it is not a substitute for reading the entire code for each state where one is licensed, in addition to reading the ASHA Code of Ethics.
ASHA Code of Ethics Principle IV Rule J: "Individuals shall not provide professional services without exercising independent professional judgment, regardless of referral source or prescription."
So, no matter what the audiologist's circumstances, it is incumbent on the practitioner to determine when to accept limitations on professional responsibility. Unlike ASHA and three states above, Delaware does not currently address this specific topic in its code of ethics. No obvious conclusions can be drawn, however, by the absence of this provision but it is puzzling. Maryland's provision is most similar to ASHA's, but is less restrictive: The language uses "may" instead of the more legally compelling "shall."
Because of the varied and significant ethical dilemmas presented by prescription, the ASHA Board of Ethics (BOE) wrote an Issues in Ethics Statement about Prescription (2010) to provide additional analysis and focus. This ASHA BOE resource is instructive for all practitioners regardless of whether their state boards specifically address prescription.
This provision is quite similar among all five sources. The more inclusive and arguably better drafted versions include broader language, such as "directly or by implication" or "expressed or implied, oral or written." Maryland's provision is most similar to ASHA's but appears to allow more discretion (i.e., uses "may" as opposed to "shall").
ASHA Code of Ethics Principle I: "Individuals shall honor their responsibility to hold paramount the welfare of persons they serve professionally or who are participants in research and scholarly activities, and they shall treat animals involved in research in a humane manner."
This provision is quite similar among all five sources, with ASHA's being the most expansive (e.g., including participants and animals). Some of the other codes address scholarly activities elsewhere.
While the first four provisions are very similar, Ohio takes a different tack. Requiring licensees to identify competent, dependable referral sources may well lead to better protection of the public. The authors of Ohio's code appear to believe that the practitioner would be better informed about competent, dependable referral sources than would the individual patient.
So, as these examples show, the variations are not necessarily large or predictable and are unlikely to disappear. The challenge for practitioners is felt acutely when members or certificate holders inquire of ASHA for assistance in evaluating a potential or actual ethical dilemma that is associated with differing standards. ASHA's Code of Ethics can be easily located on its website. On the other hand, it is difficult at best to quickly locate online most state boards' codes of ethics or standards of conduct. Web addresses change periodically, and sites can go down, so even bookmarking is not always helpful. In the heat of the moment, the inquiring member or certificate holder can forget the requirement to comply with the mandates of both ASHA and the applicable state board(s) of examiners. If they have not previously appreciated this dual obligation, members or certificate holders may find the situation overwhelming.
Fortunately, with a little advance preparation, this situation can easily be overcome. Ideally, before faced with an ethical or a time sensitive issue, the practitioner can take the time to locate all of the codes of ethics and standards of conduct that apply to his or her professional conduct. If clarification is needed, the practitioner can contact the compliance or ethics officer at his or her place of work and get information on ASHA's Code of Ethics on the website, and locate the state board of examiners conduct rules.
There are a number of steps practitioners can take to prepare for ethics challenges.
Minimal advance preparation can relieve unnecessary stress and lead to better evaluation of the ethical implications of a factual scenario in professional practice.

Like many other places in Viet Nam, people work and live pretty much in the same area. When your livelihood depends on farming and fishing the river, it makes sense to live there too.

Ryonet Acquires Riley Hopkins Screen Printing Riley Hopkins Plant Will Remain Open For Manufacturing Jan 8, 2013 – by Counselor Ryonet Corporation, a provider of silk screening equipment and supplies, has acquired Riley Hopkins Screen Printing Machinery LLC. Based in Gig Harbor, WA, Riley Hopkins has more than 35 years experience building manual screen printing presses. The company's plant in Gig Harbor will remain open for manufacturing. Parts and equipment will continue to be sold from that facility and Ryonet locations. Further details on the acquisition were not released. In a statement, Riley and Val Hopkins, the former owners of the company, said it made sense to sell to Ryonet given the two businesses' strong partnership over the years. "We have worked very well together during Ryonet's growth, and it is only logical to have them take over the reins," the Hopkins said, in a statement. "They have an excellent customer service record, great warehousing facilities in a number of cities, and the ability to respond quickly to customer needs, not only from a machinery standpoint, but from a printing standpoint as well. All in all, Ryonet is best equipped to handle the move to the next level of excellence." Based in Vancouver, WA, Ryonet is focused on continuing to improve the Riley Hopkins line, with some "very exciting things" already in the works, said CEO Ryan Moor. Adds." Established in 2004, Ryonet Corporation is the largest supplier of screen printing supplies, equipment and training. Moor, the company's founder, is a member of the Counselor Hot List for 2012.

Isabeli FontanaTop 99 Women
Ryan Born/WireImage.com More Isabeli Fontana pics
Why is She famous
Isabeli is part of the "Brazilian model invasion" of the late 1990s and has already scored sexy spreads in serious publications from the Victoria's Secret catalog to the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.
Isabeli Fontana Quote
" I don't think of myself as pretty. I am what I am."
87 Sex Appeal
While Isabeli has always been beautiful, her sex.
The fact that Isabeli isn't into the usual party scene isn't necessarily a drawback. Her modest tastes and simple pleasures give her that girl-next-door aura, which can be all the more enticing. What's sexier than a knockout with nothing to prove? After all, sometimes less really is more.

Fresh fruits and vegetables are never a problem unless they have bugs (certain vegetables, such as lettuce or broccoli, are commonly infested with insects. These vegetables must be carefully inspected before consumption); or they were grown in Israel (Israeli produce must be tithed and (generally) may not be from a Sabbatical year. Rabbinical certification is necessary to ensure that the tithing and Sabbatical laws were observed).
Meat must come from cud-chewing mammals with hooves that are split, and must be slaughtered and processed in a specific, “kosher” way. Poultry are limited to chickens, ducks and certain other non-predatory birds (see How do I know whether a particular bird is kosher or not?), which must be prepared in the same manner as kosher beef. The consumer can know if meat/poultry is kosher by looking for a Kosher certification on the packaging.
Kosher seafood must have fins and scales. Grains, beans, and legumes (without additional ingredients) are cool. Wines, beverages and anything liquid are only good if they’ve got a kosher symbol on their label (also see Does 100% juice need Kosher certification?).
Kosher today means that a Kosher certification company has inspected the production process from start to finish. They check every vat, oven, conveyor belt, container and piece of packaging machinery to really make sure that nothing non-kosher gets in your food
C..
How do I keep kosher?
1. Kosher made simple
For kosher food, just look for the kosher labels on the package: circled K or U, Star-K and others. (A plain K1 don't mean much.) They tell you that they’re certified kosher. See What are all those kosher symbols?
Mixing meat and milk products in any way, shape or form is not kosher.2 And Kosher is more than what you eat—it’s what you eat it on, and how you make it, too. So it's necessary to have separate dishes, cutlery, utensils and gadgets, and ovens, for meat and dairy items.
Most processed foods are kosher today, anyway, as more and more supermarkets are tuning in to the trend and supplying kosher provisions. You can usually find kosher stock without much of a search
3. “What about my favorite foods?”
Not to worry. You can almost always find kosher substitutes. And many processed foods are kosher today, anyway. As for meat and poultry, more and more supermarkets are tuning in to the trend and supplying kosher provisions. You can usually find kosher stock without much of a search. And with the magic and convenience of the Web, an ever-growing selection of on-line purveyors will internationally deliver kosher whatever, straight to your door at rock-bottom prices, in the event you don’t find what you want in the aisles. You can even get kosher buffalo! I kid you not:.
4. Eating Out
Most cities with a fair sized Jewish community have kosher eateries serving up some of the most fabulous food you’ll ever eat. Visit for a kosher joint near you. (Helps if you don't live in South Dakota.)
5. Eat! Eat! Eat!
Want Beef Stroganoff? How about Beef Sukihaki? Ever tried Bruschetta? Or Pasta Olio Aglio? It’s all kosher, and yours for the taking. There are approximately 17 gadzillion kosher cookbooks available, and more coming out daily. Start with the Spice and Spirit Kosher Cookbook, the mother of all kosher tomes, available from Amazon or your local Chabad center. Above all, if you’ve got any questions about kosher matters, get answers: call your local Chabad rabbi posthaste.

Northern Saw-whet Owl
Northern Saw-whet Owls roost during the day on a low branch of a dense conifer. The field guides say that these birds often use the same tree day after day. I can confirm that this is true. On December 5, 2010 there was a report of a Northern Saw-whet Owl on Farm Island near Pierre. I followed the directions a friend had given me, and found the bird right where he said it would be. A few weeks later I was told the bird was still roosting in the same tree on December 18 during the Pierre Christmas Bird Count. Yesterday I decided to go back and have another look. Despite the below freezing temperatures and snow up to the middle of my calves, I trudged the mile and a half from the parking lot to the tree where I had seen the little owl in December. There it was: same tree, same branch, 43 days later. Out of the tens of thousands of cedar trees dotting Farm Island, why would this little owl choose this particular tree? I forgot to ask him! Write me for directions on how to find it, and you can go ask him yourself!

I have to convert NCR TIFF format images to 'standard' TIFF
format images, writing in C. I have some source code which
claims to do this conversion. After conversion the TIFF image
has the following 2 problems I am aware of (and note that the
orientation value of image is 3).
Using XV under Linux, the image loads and displays without
any warning issued. The problem is the image is reversed
horizontally, with the right side on the left and vice versa.
Vertically the display is correct. How can I reverse the
image horizontally? I have tried settings 1-8 on the tagvalue
for orientation, and the image will flip upside down, but none
of the values will cause a right to left flip. That seems very
strange to me! I have picked up the specs for both version 4
and version 5, the file I'm writing looks correct by these.
The image will not load and display under Lviewpro on NT, with
the error msg 'Unknown data compression algorithm 4(0x4)'. What
can I do with regards to uncompressing using the unknown
algorithym, and then save using a different compression type?
Is that my only/best solution?
Can anyone give me any help with this? Is there information
and/or source code available covering this area? What would be
a good book on this and similar questions? I have little
flexibility with regard to image format or compression since
these images have to be used by an existing business system.
Thanks in advance...

The American Society for Surgery of the Hand works very hard to give our members important member benefits and opportunities, but especially in this time of substantial health care reform, it’s important to join an outreach effort that extends beyond the reach of the Hand Society. The AMA is a rich resource for physicians. In addition to your ASSH membership, joining the AMA is an efficient way to be a part of the decisions that will shape the health care industry. In the message below, Andrew Gurman, MD, ASSH member and AMA Trustee, has shared the incredible accomplishments of the AMA in the past year which have benefited us as hand surgeons.Sincerely,L. Andrew Koman, MDPresident, ASSH
AMA: A Helping Hand for PhysiciansAndrew Gurman, M.D.Trustee, American Medical Association
As we focus on the day-to-day work of caring for patients, our energy is concentrated on how to best care for our patients, successfully run our practices, and balance our time at work and with families..
As we all know only too well, this year we once again faced the specter of a steep Medicare physician payment cut. Advocacy by AMA and its member physicians turned the tide, and eighteen months of Medicare physician payment cuts were replaced with updates that better reflect growing medical practice costs – this represents a positive swing of $17,000 on average per physician.
These past few months, AMA has made headlines because of its work to make health insurance companies pay appropriate fees for out-of-network care. AMA lawsuits against Cigna, Aetna and WellPoint claim that each insurance company conspired with Ingenix, a unit of UnitedHealth Group, on a price fixing scheme to set artificially low reimbursement rates for out-of-network care. A year-long investigation by the New York attorney general confirmed that the Ingenix database is intentionally rigged to allow insurers to shortchange reimbursements. AMA President Dr. Nancy Nielsen stood by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo’s side during the public announcement.
While these are two of the more visible examples of the AMA’s work for physicians, there are many more that fly a bit lower on the radar screen. For example, the AMA worked with the National Council of Insurance Legislators to craft model legislation outlawing silent PPO’s. This is an insurance industry practice that siphoned millions of dollars from physicians in the form of discounted fees that were never agreed to.
Recent partnerships with state medical societies have benefited our colleagues in Florida, Arkansas and Pennsylvania. In late 2008, the AMA and the Florida Medical Association successfully fought for the physicians’ right to provide and oversee the medical decisions for patients at Lawnwood Medical Center. The AMA gave significant support to physicians in Arkansas who successfully argued in the courts to overturn economic credentialing by the Baptist Health System. In Pennsylvania, influential testimony by the AMA helped defeat the proposed merger of Highmark and Independence Blue Cross, thus preventing a monopoly.
The AMA does so much more in the areas of medical education, credentialing, quality and safety. For example, a brand new online learning center was launched for physicians interested in implementing ePrescribing. The new online learning center includes complete and unbiased information on ePrescribing vendor prices and features and calculators to estimate time savings and determine Medicare ePrescribing incentive payments. The AMA-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement works with the specialty societies and others to develop performance measures, and are considering topics that would apply to hand surgery such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
The work of the AMA benefits all physicians, and we are stronger together. The truth is that we can make a real difference when we work together to improve the health care system. This year looks to be the year for health care reform, and the AMA is hard at work to ensure that reforms are meaningful and benefit physicians and patients.
In these tough economic times it’s tempting to cut costs and not join as many organizations. But the rapid pace of change in the health care system makes it more important than ever that you add your voice to the debate through membership in the AMA.
I invite you to join us, and feel free to contact me at andrew.gurman@ama-assn.org. You can also follow news of what the AMA does for you through Twitter at.

Vlog: Moving Update & New House
So many of you were confused about what is going on, and where I’m moving to exactly. So here’s a quick update vlog. Let me …
<|endofexample|>
I'd been too busy for any metaphysical life, but it was the night of the Full Moon, so I forced myself onto the balcony for a brief ceremony. It was the first time in days I'd sat quietly with myself. I was surprised to discover how peaceful the night was. A veil of blue-white moonlight fell gently over the patio. A faint odor of lemon blossoms played somewhat coyly with my senses. I locked my gaze onto the Moon and breathed in deeply. I felt my barriers dissolve. My etheric body seemed to merge with the night, as though I'd been drawn into an invisible current of Full Moon tide... until... Until I could push it away no longer. Three balconies away, a dog was yapping. Nonstop.
It was one of those tiny dogs, the kind with a bark so piercing, it goes straight to the center of your forehead like a small, well-placed hatchet. Possessing the stamina of long distance runners, dogs like this can go on for hours. My mood swung precariously... watching the Moon... trying to ignore the yips and yaps... when my desire for peace suddenly jumped off its end of the teeter totter and I fell headlong into a whine of persecution, "All I wanted was to honor the Moon, my life is so harried, can't I have just these few brief moments in peace... poor me, poor..."
And then I got it. The message was as clear as the great round Moon above: Nothing was in my way..
"Part of insights' mystique is their seemingly sudden and random appearance. Why do insights come when they do? We might be stumbling in the dark for days, desperate for illumination, yet nothing comes. According to Eastern traditions, the explanation may lie with the Moon."
Likely I saw this once on a bumper sticker. Or read it in one of those daily meditation books. But on this Full Moon it arrived as an insight, meaning I no longer heard the barking dog once I got it. That sound dissolved. Insights have a power that ideas do not. Ideas are cheap, easy to find. They swirl around us like dust devils. Insights, however, are sharp and penetrating. They go to the center of situations, illumine our stuck places, propel us toward new actions and perspectives. Insights pop. They're liberating. And their intensity can nourish us long after the moment they show up.
Part of insights' mystique is their seemingly sudden and random appearance. Why do insights come when they do? We might be stumbling in the dark for days, desperate for illumination, yet nothing comes. According to Eastern traditions, the explanation may lie with the Moon. My barking-dog insight appeared on the night of the Full Moon. The Full Moon period itself straddles both day and night - it's not necessary to make reference to the night here. Tibetan lamas and Hindu sages believe that at certain moments in the lunar cycle, especially at New and Full Moons, energetic doorways can open and receiving insights is easier.
"Lunar gaps" is, what astrologer Michael Erlewine calls them, "regular opportunities, joints in the nick of time, when insights are somehow more possible than at other times."[1] Lest we start imagining a dramatic tear in the fabric of space/time, where insights rain down like a special effect in some sci fi movie, Erlewine is quick to point out that the gap he describes is actually a gap "in our particular set of obscurations, our own cloudiness."[2]
The gap opens in our own (normally muddled) mind. It's the Eastern belief that insights appear at certain Moon times because there's a greater likelihood for mental clarity then. This is why many Eastern religions routinely set these days aside for fasting, meditation, and worship. One of the most auspicious of these lunar times is the Full Moon.
Years ago when I got the notion to start honoring the Full Moon, I went searching for a vaguely imagined pagan something-or-other, like dancing naked around a purple lunar maypole. Not surprisingly I never found (even in Southern California!) anywhere this was done. I settled for arranging my crystals in a medicine wheel in my backyard, lighting incense, sage or candles, and circumambulating it all, maybe holding a positive visualization, something lofty like world peace. But over the years my rituals acquired a greater and greater simplicity. I now honor the Full Moon with a quiet sit. I head out after sundown and wait for the Moon to come peeking over the mountains. I sit there watching till the Moon is fully above the mountains.
This slows me down nicely. I head back into the house with a calmer mind, but I don't always bring enlightenment back inside. When I need an insight at the Full Moon, however, I do what Erlewine advises: I observe. Writes Erlewine, "The word 'observe' is a lot closer to what happens during these lunar gaps. OBSERVE the nature of the day. OBSERVE your mind at that time. (...) It is while being present - observing these seed times - that the so-called lunar gap can show itself."[3]
This is a fine formula for making the most of the Full Moon: Tune into whatever is happening. By devoting quiet attention to the outer and inner worlds, your mind can settle and clear. A gap will open in the chatter of conditioned thinking. An insight pops. You see into your situation with new and greater precision. Just as the Moon is made full with the opposing Sun's light, so you will be illuminated too.
Mist. This was a familiar scene in the horror films I grew up on. Of course I never met a real werewolf. But I often heard it said: the Full Moon drives people crazy.
Why is it that the Full Moon brings greater clarity to the East, but in the West on Full Moon nights, nurses and cocktail waitresses steel themselves for a wild and challenging time? In the West it's widely reported that murders, arson, and suicides increase at the Full Moon; also, traffic accidents, domestic violence, fights at hockey games and prisons; calls to poison centers and admissions to psychiatric hospitals soar. At least that's what people say, although most scientific research has failed to prove them right. That doesn't deter the believers, who chalk it up to a conspiracy among scientists to deny the obvious, that the Full Moon makes us nuts.
There are a few empirical studies that have successfully proven this belief. They're widely quoted. They're also criticized for lacking proper research controls (one covered a period where a high percentage of Full Moons fell on weekends, days that also show a high correlation with the reported behaviors). Bottom line, the Full-Moon-makes-us-crazy statistics can't be replicated. What's more, they often contradict each other, with some studies confirming that Quarter Moons bring the greater tension. Nonetheless, in a study among students at universities in Florida, Canada, and Hawaii, when queried about the Moon, half agreed that people are strange when the Moon is full.[4]
Why does the belief in full-Moon crazies persist? Scientists point to the believers. The human mind is irrational and easy to fool, they say. It likes solutions, but rarely wants to work at them. When something odd occurs it's easy enough to look up and finger the giant lone culprit in the sky. Who can miss the Full Moon - although when wild, wacky events occur at other times, few seem to notice its absence.
Cognition studies have shown the mind typically seeks to confirm its beliefs and conveniently ignores or discredits contrary evidence. In other words, we believe what we want to believe. ."[5]
."
After years of watching Full Moons, I'm inclined to side with the scientists. Blaming the Moon for bad behavior seems generally unfair. Many Full Moons are positively lovely. Nor have I killed anyone, gone into a hospital, or even gotten into an accident when the Moon was full. But I'm intrigued by the persistence of the lunacy rumor. Unlike a scientist,?
According to folklore, if you sleep outdoors under a Full Moon, you'll either be attacked by a werewolf or become one. Werewolf stories have appeared everywhere, in cultures diverse as England, Bavaria, Navajo, and Babylon. dilemma is as difficult as ever. Cemented, corralled and cowed into our cubicles, or racing hither and yon, it's a wonder we don't hear more breakout werewolf rumors. But then maybe we do. With our connection to the wild so thinned, we may have simply upgraded the werewolf story, calling it "Full Moon crazies" rather than a literal turn back to the beast. The Full Moon may evoke strange behaviors when our natural spirit goes too long unrecognized - or when we're around someone else like that. The more pent up and disconnected we are, the greater our need to erupt from civilized codes.
If my theory is true, then reckless driving, domestic violence and suicide attempts can happen at anytime - not just when the Moon is full (which seems to agree with the statistics). But perhaps these events hit us more deeply when we see the Full Moon rise, evoking memories of all that we've lost, provoking our yearning to connect with the wholeness of nature again.
. I doubt you'll really go crazy. You just might feel more sane. And if you've got the urge, know that it's quite all right to howl.
A peaceful monk or a howling werewolf: the Full Moon makes sense of them both. There may be no greater emblem for reconciliation and wholeness than the Full Moon, rising at sunset and setting at dawn, filtering the dark with light. It's the only Moon phase that shines the whole night through. That one side of the planet finds clarity in the Full Moon and the other sees lunacy simply sings of the moment's astronomy: there is an opposition between Sun and Moon.
The East, with its dharma of contemplation and greater identification with lunar impermanence, does what the Moon does: it reflects. It stills and offers itself to receive the light of awareness. Insights illumine the inner world. The West, with its dharma of action and greater identification with solar will, does what the Sun does: it projects. It finds its reflection in the outer world, staring back from a lunar mirror. Western Full Moon insights often come by way of conflict, via a meaningful meeting with someone other. Either approach might bring enlightenment. Both are routes to resolving the opposition and achieving a wider perspective on life.
."
If we meet an "other" on Full Moon nights (or by way of transit or opposition in our natal chart through planets separated by 180 degrees), the encounter will frequently mirror a neglected or unconscious aspect of ourselves. What we repress or deny in our personalities, what we shove into our own personal darkness, will often attract its expression in the outer world. The man who thinks he has no anger will meet someone who does. The woman who thinks she is supremely compassionate will keep finding people who aren't. An astrologer who thinks she's in tune with the lunar vibrations will suddenly hear her own nervous mind in a yapping dog three balconies away.
Against the sometimes chaotic, sometimes endlessly routine experience of life, oppositions remind us of the need for balance. Whether by natal aspect or transit, oppositions challenge us to reach compromises between our expectations and reality, to embrace our inner contradictions, to move beyond our experience of a separate self into an acknowledgement of our unity with the world.They challenge us to realize that sometimes there are two valid and distinctly opposite points of view. Because life accommodates them, we can and should learn to as well.. Until we allow ourselves to embrace multiple sides of an issue, there can be no experience of wholeness. Nothing resolves an opposition like acceptance.
This is a hard truth for me sometimes. Having no planetary oppositions in my chart, it's not natural for me to think this way. Ask the partners I've been with! They'll tell you that according to Dana, there is only one way to meditate, load a dishwasher or train a dog. I've got the bottom line on raising children, and if I need to do laundry, the washing machine is suddenly, quite exclusively mine. Those without oppositions tend more towards self-containment than compromise.
Where there's a void in the chart, we attract those who have what we lack. Typically I've been with men whose charts are laced with oppositions. The draw between us is powerful. Yet on the surface we can both appear pretty uncompromising. My opposition-rich partners are trying to work out a balance between opposing inner urges. They want things to be fair, but are also afraid of being swept into acquiescence or paralyzed by feelings of dependency. I take a stand, they resist it; we switch and do it the other way around. Straining and stumbling, we're trying to learn what healthy compromise really is. Perhaps the only real difference between us is that I end arguments with "I'd be fine by myself," while they conclude "I'd be fine with somebody else"!
Oppositions offer a tantalizing gift of wholeness. But like a wise teacher using skillful means, they lead us first to what stands in our way. So strong has the pressure of Saturn-and-Pluto's opposition been this past year (in 2001/2002; editor's note), few among us have escaped its confrontation of our limits and obstinacy. Where this pair of planets has straddled our charts is where our cherished beliefs, like so many World Trade Centers, have been toppled, however traumatically, so that we might more seriously begin the work toward inner and outer peace. Whatever your politics, the stalemate between the Palestinians and the Israelis, stands as a kind of global Sabian image of an opposition not worked through.
."
Oppositions reveal. Just as Luna on Full Moon nights fully accepts the light of the Sun, so must we accept whatever truths shine toward us. These won't always be negative..
The lunation cycle's climax can bring fulfillment or failure. Either way, life goes on. The Full Moon is also a turning point. It begins the waning hemi-cycle. After the Sun/Moon opposition, comes the Full Moon period's inconjunct - an aspect of disequilibrium. The waxing inconjunct at the Gibbous phase asks us to make last minute adjustments and refinements. The Full Moon's inconjunct reminds us that no matter what pinnacles or valleys we've reached, life doesn't stop. Perhaps it's this awareness that inspires a more philosophical tone during the waning hemi-cycle. We're drawn to build and achieve during the waxing days, but in the waning days we're moved to review, discard, and perhaps reorient ourselves. It's a more thoughtful,internal time.
Those born at the Full Moon are often pulled between these two orientations. And typically their stress is worked out through relationships. For virtually every Full Mooner I've known, relationships are a central theme in their lives. Whether it's one key relationship that seems to supply their center of gravity, or a series of traumatic relationships that gradually matures their understanding, or even a repudiation of relationships to keep themselves sane - negotiating a balance via the "other" is an important way to reconcile the special lunar energy in their chart.
Achieving wholeness is a weighty birthright. Full Moon babies may instinctively (and perhaps overwhelmingly) feel, to paraphrase Walt Whitman, that they "contain multitudes." They often have high expectations of themselves, an urge towards greatness, a desire to achieve something significant this lifetime. It's said that Buddha was born on the Full Moon. His influence has endured for thousands of years. And at the core of his teachings lies an incredible reconciliation of life's myriad oppositions: all selves, says Buddha, are one. That's a nice thing to contemplate during the next Full Moon.

Scientists have begun the final leg of a five-year, NASA-funded mission to reach the bottom of Cenote Zacatón in Mexico, the world's deepest known sinkhole.
No one has ever reached bottom and at least one diver has died in the attempt. Scientists want to learn more about Cenote Zacatón's physical dimensions, the geothermal vents that feed it and the forms of life that exist in its murky depths.
Previous expeditions tested the robotic probe that will make the dive. The Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer, known as DEPTHX, is a tangerine-shaped submarine designed to survey and explore for life in extreme regions on Earth and potentially in outer space. During eight years of research at Zacatón, doctoral student Marcus Gary, who coordinates the DEPTHX mission, and hydrogeology professor Jack Sharp, both DEPTHX technology has also been approved for a new NASA mission to explore one of Antarctica's ice-bound polar lakes. Researchers believe ice-bound lakes hold clues to the origins of life on Earth.
William Stone of Stone Aerospace in Del Valle, Texas, is principal investigator on the project. The research team also includes robotics experts, engineers, geobiologists and geochemists from Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, Colorado School of Mines, Southwest Research Institute and Mexico's Universidad Autonama de Nuevo Leon and Universidad del Noreste.
Unique in the world of robotic explorers, DEPTHX is autonomous. The probe does not rely on instructions from humans to decide where to go or what to do. Using software developed by Carnegie Mellon graduate student Nathaniel Fairfield, DEPTHX creates 3D maps of previously unexplored areas as it swims along and then uses those same maps to navigate back to the surface.
Two web sites monitored the mission: at geology.com, a science writer from The University of Texas at Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences maintained a daily blog of the mission beginning May 16, and the Robotics Institute's DEPTHX Web site,, featured daily updates, images and graphics beginning May 15.

This forecast report combines the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth with one of the traditional planets, in this case, with the planet Venus, and examines their interplay. The resulting forecasts points out all of the major activity for the coming time period involving this planet. Let us take a moment to review some of the traditional meanings for Venus.
Venus is the planet of love and compassion, everything we care about and also how we go about caring. The planet Venus not only relates to questions of romance, but also to our values, including what we value – being connected to the value of “things” in our life; Venus is thus connected to money, wealth, and to all of our 'valuables' - whatever.

By Athletes' Acceleration | March 5th, 2008
In my email yesterday I talked about the importance
I place on educating my athletes about their training
so they understand exactly what is going to make them
better athletes.
How, like Morpheus in the movie The Matrix, I offer
them the blue pill (just train and go home) or the
red pill (the truth about becoming a faster athlete).
And what a profound impact taking the red pill can
have on athletic performance.
How profound?
Here at Athletes’ Acceleration we’re celebrating our
most recent success story in helping young athletes
reach new levels of athletic achievement!
This past winter I went back to my alma mater and
began working with a group of high school sprinters
I had never seen or met before.
Just 14 weeks later, my girls 4×200 meter relay team
achieved something that hadn’t been done at the
school since Ronald Reagan was President (a span of
22 years) - won an All State Championship!
To celebrate this impressive accomplishment by a
hard working and highly dedicated group of athletes,
we’re having a special ‘State Champions’ sale here

------------------------------ | March 4th, 2008
I strongly believe in educating my athletes as to
why we’re training the way we are.
Why what we’re doing is going to make them faster.
And I strongly encourage them to ask questions so
it makes sense, not just blindly follow what I tell
them to do like all their other coaches.
In a way I consider myself to be like Morpheus, a
character in my favorite movie, The Matrix. My athletes
are like Neo, the main character.
(If you don’t know what I’m talking about you should
really go rent this movie.)
There’s a scene in the movie where Morpheus offers
Neo a choice…
Take the blue pill and the story ends. Neo wakes up
and believes whatever he wants.
Take the red pill and, as Morpheus says, “You stay
in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole
goes. Remember — all I am offering is the truth,
nothing more.”
Invariably most of my athletes take the red pill.
And I start telling them the truth.
Before long they start to see just how purposeless and
ineffective the training they’ve gotten in the past
was.
The more success they have, the more questions they
ask. The more time they are willing to commit to
getting better.
The results speak for themselves.
It’s a double edged sword, however.
Once athletes know the truth about real training, it’s
very difficult to go back and buy into what some of
their other coaches are telling them because they
know it makes no sense.
That it’s not making them better. It’s probably even
erasing some of the progress they’ve made.
After all, I don’t think it’s a stretch to suggest
that 8 out of 10 youth/high school coaches don’t know
very much about speed, strength and conditioning.
At least not in my experience.
Many people still believe that speed can’t be taught
or significantly improved.
Oh it can, believe me.
In fact, this winter I accomplished something in 14
*weeks* that hadn’t been done in the 22 *years* prior
to my arrival.
That’s right, 22 years. Not since 1986.
And I’m not saying this out of arrogance or as an
indictment of previous coaching efforts.
Because numbers are objective facts.
Tomorrow I’m going to tell you exactly what that is
and how you can directly benefit from my success.
So keep an eye out for my email tomorrow.
Remember, you can ignore tomorrow’s email
(take the blue pill) and believe whatever you want
to believe.
Or you can take the red pill. Because like Morpheus,
all I’m offering is the truth, nothing more…
Until tomorrow,
Latif Thomas aka Morpheus

Polls and surveys seem to be all the rage these days,
especially with the political primaries in full swing.
I’m a big believer in the value of surveying your
audience. After all, our primary function is to provide
you with resources and information that will improve
your coaching and your athletes’ performances.
Patrick and I have a new idea we’ve been kicking around
for a while now. But we want to make sure you are
interested in it before we invest too much time and
energy into it.
It doesn’t matter if we think it’s a great idea if
you aren’t interested!
So I put together a quick survey that I’d like you to
take. It’s quick and painless and should only take you
about 2 minutes to complete.
Your feedback will let us know whether we’ve got a

2013 NFL Mock Draft
Athlon Sports predicts the first 32 picks of the 2013 NFL Draft.
By: Nathan Rush | 2/8/13, 9:45 AM EST
Submitted by Nathan Rush on Fri, 2013-02-08 09:45
1. Kansas City Chiefs1 of 33.
2. Jacksonville Jaguars2 of 33.
3. Oakland Raiders3 of 33
Sharrif Floyd, DT, Florida
An explosive 3-technique tackle in the mold of Warren Sapp, Floyd is flying up draft boards due to his size, athleticism and relatively few red flags compared to his 2013 peers.
4. Philadelphia Eagles4 of 33
Dion Jordan, OLB, Oregon
Chip Kelly wants to play a 3-4 defense and knows just what kind of player Jordan can be. A perfect fit both schematically and in terms of familiarity with the coaching staff.
5. Detroit Lions5 of 33
Eric Fisher, LT, Central Michigan
There may not be much of a talent gap between Fisher and Texas A&M's projected No. 1 pick Luke Joeckel. Fisher is a plug and play left tackle from Day One.
6. Cleveland Browns6 of 33
Dee Milliner, CB, Alabama
The consensus top cornerback in the draft is the best player on the board for the Browns, who could also make a surprise splash by reaching for a quarterback to compete with Brandon Weeden.
7. Arizona Cardinals7 of 33
Matt Barkley, QB, USC
The Cardinals have been fans of Barkley throughout the draft evaluation process. Even with the acquisition of Carson Palmer, Arizona could still use a quarterback of the future to build on.
8. Buffalo Bills8 of 33.
9. New York Jets9 of 33.
10. Tennessee Titans10 of 33
Chance Warmack, OG, Alabama
Hall of Fame guards Mike Munchak and Bruce Matthews are now the Titans' head coach and O-line coach, respectively. If anyone knows Warmack's value, it's those two.
11. San Diego Chargers11 of 33.
12. Miami Dolphins12 of 33
Jonathan Cooper, OG, North Carolina
Two of the better guard prospects of the past decade are in this year's draft, in Alabama's Chance Warmack and Cooper, whose quick feet and overall athleticism are rare for an interior lineman.
13. Tampa Bay Buccaneers13 of 33
Xavier Rhodes, CB, Florida State
The latest in a long line of Seminole corners, the X-man looks the part and would fill a need for the Buccaneers, who remain players in the Darrelle Revis sweepstakes.
14. Carolina Panthers14 of 33
Star Lotulelei, DT, Utah
A heart condition discovered during medical screenings at the Combine has caused Star's shine to fade. But the Panthers would pounce on this top-5 talent if he fell.
15. New Orleans Saints15 of 33
Jarvis Jones, OLB, Georgia
Another health risk with top-5 potential, Jones' spinal stenosis has scared off some teams. On tape, Jones is the top 3-4 outside linebacker and a perfect fit for the Saints.
16. St. Louis Rams16 of 33
Sheldon Richardson, DT, Missouri
The St. Louis native has the size and swagger to be the type of distruptive D-lineman coach Jeff Fisher loves.
17. Pittsburgh Steelers17 of 33
Tyler Eifert, TE, Notre Dame
One of the potential surprises come draft night, Eifert could be selected much higher than expected due to his status as the clear-cut top tight end available.
18. Dallas Cowboys18 of 33
D.J. Fluker, RT, Alabama
The big man is a mauler at right tackle and likely could kick inside to guard with similar results. The Boys need O-line help and Fluker would certainly provide that.
19. New York Giants19 of 33
Alec Ogletree, MLB, Georgia
A pre-Combine DUI has teams scratching their heads regarding the knucklehead factor with Ogletree, the top middle linebacker in a solid class of inside backers.
20. Chicago Bears20 of 33
Manti Te'o, MLB, Notre Dame
Brian Urlacher's replacement going to the heart of Fighting Irish territory? That's too good to be true. But still not as hard to believe as the Te'o tale of internet love gone wrong.
21. Cincinnati Bengals21 of 33
Kenny Vaccaro, S, Texas
The top safety in the class has a wide range of landing spots, starting in the early teens and going into the twentysomethings. Cincy is a club where team need meets prospect value.
22. St. Louis Rams22 of 33.
23. Minnesota Vikings23 of 33
Tavon Austin, WR, West Virginia
One of the fastest players and fastest risers in this year's draft, Austin made Geno Smith look good. The triple-threat would slide right into Percy Harvin's old role in Minny.
24. Indianapolis Colts24 of 33
Menelik Watson, RT, Florida State
Protecting Andrew Luck is priority No. 1 for the Colts. Watson is raw but possesses the type of frame and feet expected from a former college basketball player turned O-tackle.
25. Minnesota Vikings25 of 33.
26. Green Bay Packers26 of 33.
27. Houston Texans27 of 33.
28. Denver Broncos28 of 33.
29. New England Patriots29 of 33
Robert Woods, WR, USC
Although he was overshadowed by Biletnikoff Award-winning Trojan teammate Marqise Lee (No. 9), Woods is still a top-flight playmaker in his own right.
30. Atlanta Falcons30 of 33
Damontre Moore, DE, Texas A&M
Once thought of as the "next Von Miller," at least in terms of draft stock, Moore has taken a tumble down the board, going from top-10 to back-half of the first.
31. San Francisco 49ers31 of 33
Margus Hunt, DE, SMU
The "Eastern Block" is a 6'8" monster who could be a long-term replacement option to the aging warrior Justin Smith at end in the Niners' dominant 3-4 scheme.
32. Baltimore Ravens32 of 33.

Self-managed superannuation funds: A statistical overview 2008-09 is available in Portable Document Format (PDF).
Download a PDF of Self-managed superannuation funds: A statistical overview 2008-09 (NAT 74068, PDF, 644 KB).
Purpose
As part of the Super System Review (the Review), A Statistical Summary of Self Managed Superannuation Funds was released on 12 December 2009. The majority of the Self Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) information included in that paper was sourced from both publicly available and previously unpublished ATO data.
This publication updates the Super System Review statistical summary using 2008-09 year data. We propose to provide annual updates.
Where appropriate, we refer to Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) data for comparisons to the SMSF sector.
Background
The ATO began regulating SMSFs in the 2000 financial year under the regulatory framework of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act).
For information on what constitutes an SMSF and the ATO's regulatory role, go to
Traditionally, SMSF data was collected on the super fund income tax return. From 2008, a new SMSF annual return (SAR) was developed to enhance regulation of SMSFs and collect more reliable data.
Generally the data for this overview has been collected from:
The SMSF sector remains the largest sector of the Australian superannuation industry, with 99% of the number of funds and over 30% of the $1.23 trillion total super assets1.
At 30 June 2010, there were around 425,000 SMSFs and almost $387 billion in assets.2 There were also approximately 810,000 members in the SMSF sector, about 7% of roughly 11.6 million members in Australian super funds.3
The data shows the SMSF sector responds to government initiatives or changing economic circumstances, particularly in relation to total asset holdings and shifts in asset types held. This is not inconsistent with the general view that SMSF trustees establish SMSFs for control and flexibility. Such observations take into account that 2010 data is not yet included in the majority of this overview's analysis.
In recent years there has been a trend for members of new SMSFs to be from younger age groups than those of the total SMSF member population. Overall, SMSF members compared to non-SMSF fund members tend to be older and have both higher average balances and higher average taxable incomes.
SMSFs directly invested 76% of their assets, mainly in cash and term deposits and Australian listed shares (a total of almost 59%).
Estimates of the return on assets for the SMSF sector show negative returns for 2007-08 and 2008-09. This is consistent with the total super industry, although the size of the negative returns was smaller for SMSFs. Estimates of the operating expense ratio of SMSFs shows a direct relationship with the asset size of the SMSF.
In the five years to 30 June 2010, SMSFs have been the fastest growing sector of the Australian superannuation industry.
During this period total super assets grew by 60%, while SMSF assets grew by 122%.4The SMSF sector contributed the largest proportion with 46% of the total 60% growth in super assets.
Graph 1 shows the breakdown of the 60% growth in total super asset by fund type, based on APRA data.
Graph 1: Proportion of 5 Year Total Superannuation Growth by fund type
The overall growth in SMSF asset holdings can be attributed to continued establishment of new SMSFs, increase in contributions and net rollovers into SMSFs, and investment earnings (SMSF investment performance is discussed later).
Between the years ended 30 June 2005 to 30 June 2010, SMSF numbers have grown by 47% (see appendix 1 table 3).
Graph 2 shows the most significant growth (13%) occurred in the year ended June 2007, coinciding with the introduction of the government's Superannuation Simplification measures.5 By 2009 the growth rate had dropped to 2006 levels, most likely influenced by global economic circumstances. SMSF numbers stabilised in 2010, reflecting the improvement in community confidence.
Graph 2: Growth in the number of SMSFs from 2005 to 2010
Over this period, net establishment of new funds (establishments less wind ups) averaged over 25,000 a year (or approximately 2,100 a month) while wind ups averaged over 5,000 a year.
Overall, net establishments show a similar pattern as total fund numbers as establishments peaked in 2007 and windups peaked in 2009.
Despite the continued establishment of new SMSFs, the majority of SMSF funds have existed for over 10 years (41.8%) with 20.4% having existed for three years or less (see appendix 1, table 4).
Over the five year period to 30 June 2009, contributions to the SMSF sector averaged $32.5 billion a year (member $23.6 billion, employer $8.9 billion, see appendix 1, table 1).
Contributions peaked in the year ended 30 June 2007. This was the same year the Super Simplification measures abolished reasonable benefit limits and introduced a $1 million transitional contribution limit.
SMSF member contributions consistently exceeded employer contributions during this five year period by approximately three to one.
Since 2007, annual employer contribution amounts to SMSFs have remained relatively constant. In comparison, the amount of member contributions have varied from 84% of contributions made in 2007, to 69% and 63% in 2008 and 2009 respectively (see appendix 1, table 1).
Over the five years, most member contributions have been to SMSFs with assets worth between $500,000 and $5 million. Employer contributions have been spread mostly across SMSFs with assets worth between $200,000 and $2 million. This is particularly evident in the years ended 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2009 (see appendix 1, table 1).
Graph 3 compares contributions to SMSFs proportionately to all super fund contributions for the years ended 30 June 2005 to 30 June 2009 as reported by APRA.6 It shows contributions to SMSFs over the five years have generally remained under 30% of total super contributions. In 2007 however, the surge in member contributions saw SMSF contributions increase to 41% of total contributions.
Overall, for the five years to 30 June 2009, the proportion of member contributions to SMSFs have generally trended upwards. Note that more recent events and data from the year ended 30 June 2010 onwards are not included in this overview. It is anticipated that government initiatives such as the halving of the caps on concessional contributions introduced from the year ended 30 June 2010 will slow the growth trend in member contributions.
Graph 3: Contributions to SMSFs as a percentage of Total Australian superannuation contributions (member, employer and total)
For the five years to 30 June 2009, the $50.4 billion rolled into SMSFs consistently exceeded the $14.2 billion rolled out of SMSFs (see appendix 1, table 2).
On average it is reported over $10.1 billion is rolled into SMSFs and $2.8 billion is rolled out of SMSFs annually.
ATO data does not distinguish between amounts rolled between SMSFs and that rolled to or from non-SMSFs. However, the net result is an inward rollover amount of $36.1 billion over the five years.
Graph 4 shows inward rollovers trended upwards at a faster rate than outward rollovers, particularly up to the year ended 30 June 2008, and levelled off in 2009.
Graph 4: Total SMSF rollovers
The overall net inflow into SMSFs was $142.9 billion during the five years to 30 June 2009. Graph 5 shows that in all years, this is predominantly attributable to contributions made to SMSFs and in particular the surge in contributions in the year ended 30 June 2007.
Net transfers and benefits have tended to have limited impact on total SMSF flows. Up to 2007, annual net flows directly reflected the amount of contributions received. In the two years after 2007 however, benefit payments trended upwards at a faster rate, affecting total net flows.
Prior to 2007, benefit payments as a percentage of total contributions were between 30-40% (2004-2006), while after 2007, they were between 55-60% (2008-2009).7
Graph 5: Breakdown of SMSF fund flows
SMSFs can be established with either a corporate trustee (where all members of the SMSF are directors of the corporate trustee) or with individual trustees (where all members of the SMSF are trustees).
At 31 December 2010, around 73% of SMSFs had individual trustees rather than a corporate trustee (see appendix 1, table 5).
Graph 6 shows that in recent years there was a noticeable shift away from corporate trustees, with almost 90% of newly registered SMSFs in the year ended 30 June 2010 established with individual trustees.
Graph 6: SMSF trustee structure
For the year ended 30 June 2009, almost 70% of SMSFs reported they were solely in the accumulation phase, whereas just over 30% reported they were making pension payments to some or all members and so considered to be in the pension phase.8
Those SMSFs which commenced pension payments in 2009 had, on average, been established for at least five years.
Of SMSFs commencing pension payments in 2009, almost 49% were over five years old, less than 39% were less than two years old and almost 11% were operating in their first year.9
All SMSFs must have their financial accounts and compliance with the SIS Act audited annually by an approved auditor. Hence, approved auditors play a key role in ensuring SMSF compliance with regulatory obligations.
At 30 June 2008, it is estimated there were over 11,000 approved auditors, who conducted about 33 audits on average in the year ended 30 June 2009.10
Of these, 39% performed less than five SMSF audits in 2009. There are however, early indicators of a shift towards approved auditors performing the audit of larger numbers of SMSFs (see appendix 1, table 6).
In the year ended 30 June 2009, approximately 15% of approved auditors were reported as also providing other services for SMSF clients such as a tax agent, accountant or financial advisor or administrator.
Tax agents and accountants also play a significant role in the SMSF sector. As at December 2010, SMSFs were serviced by around 16,300 different tax agents or accountants, with approximately 83% of all SMSFs registered with a tax agent. However, 98% of SMSF annual returns are lodged by a tax agent.11
Tax agents and accountants have on average 21 registered SMSF clients. The majority have only a small number, with 62% having 10 or less and 21% (or 3,410) a single SMSF client. In contrast, 4% or 630 tax agents and accountants have registered more than 100 SMSFs (see appendix 1, table 7).
At 30 June 2010, there were about 810,000 members in the SMSF sector, of whom 54% were male and 46% female. Generally, female members tended to be younger than male members, with a higher percentage falling within all age groups, apart from those 65 and over where males exceeded females by almost 6% (see appendix 1, table 8).
Approximately 68% of SMSFs had two members, almost 23% were single member SMSFs and about 4% had either three or four members.12
At 30 June 2009, almost 25% of SMSF members received pension payments, including members who were fully or partially in the pension phase.13
At 30 June 2010, 74% of SMSF members were aged 35 to 64, while just over 80% of SMSF members were older than 45 years of age (see appendix 1, table 8).14
Recently established SMSFs tend to have younger members than the total SMSF member population.
Graph 7 shows that of the almost 6,500 SMSFs established in the June 2010 quarter,15 7.5% of members were aged over 65. In comparison, over 20% of the total SMSF member population were aged 65 and over at June 2010. In the June 2010 quarter, members below 35 years of age represented almost 11% as compared to over 5% for the whole SMSF member population. In addition 65% of members of these newly established SMSFs were less than 55 years of age compared to almost 46% of members of all SMSFs.
Graph 7: Proportion of SMSF members by age range
In the non-SMSF sector only 3% of account holders are over 65, while in the SMSF sector only 6.1% of members are under 35 years of age (see appendix 1, table 9).16
Graph 8 provides a comparison of SMSF and non-SMSF member ages at June 2009. In the SMSF sector 67% of members were over 50 years of age compared to 23% of members in the non-SMSF sector.17 In contrast, there was a higher proportion of members below 50 years of age who held accounts in the non-SMSF sector (76%), with just over 33% of SMSF members in this age range.
Graph 8: Age distribution of SMSF members and non-SMSF members as at June 2009
The average taxable income of all SMSF members in the year ended 30 June 2009 was almost $86,500. Those aged 35 to 59 had the highest average taxable income of over $100,000 (see appendix 1, table 9). The average taxable income of all other age groups is below $71,000, with members over 65 having the lowest average taxable income of less than $60,000.
SMSF members of all ages had a higher average taxable income in 2009 than non SMSF members which was just over $48,900 (see appendix 1 table 9).
Graph 9 shows SMSF trustees aged 35 to 49 had the most significant difference in average taxable income, earning $110,000 compared to non-SMSF members with below $60,000.
For the 35 and under age ranges and those aged 60 and over the difference is relatively consistent.
Graph 9: Average taxable income of SMSF members and non-SMSF members by age range
At 30 June 2009, the average SMSF member balance was $439,000 (see appendix 1, table 10), which is almost 20 times the size of the average account balance of non-SMSFs of approximately $22,000.18
Graph 10 shows that as SMSF members age, their balances increase and their taxable incomes decrease. The average SMSF member balances range from over $50,000 for members under 35 to over $708,000 for those over 65 (see appendix 1, table 9).
While the average balance of SMSF members over 60 increases, the proportion of members in the older age ranges declines. The largest proportion of members were aged 50 to 59 with an average balance of just over $440,000.
Graph 10: 2009 Taxable income and average balance of SMSF members by age range
Graph 11 shows that over the five years to 30 June 2009, average SMSF member account balances have grown steadily, peaking with almost $477,000 in 2007 before falling by 7.9% in 2009 to around $439,000.
Graph 11: SMSF and SMSF member asset sizes
Over the five years to 30 June 2009, the proportion of members with less than $100,000 asset balances decreased from 35% to 25%. Those with asset balances over $1 million rose from 5% to 10% (see appendix 1, table 11).
Graph 12 shows there was a general shift in member accounts towards the larger asset ranges over the five years. The majority of members hold assets of between $100,000 and $500,000 (48.5%). The proportion of members in this range has remained relatively constant over the five year period.
Graph 12: SMSF member asset sizes over 5 years
A comparison however, of the three years ended 30 June 2007 to 30 June 2009 in Graph 13, shows the proportion of member balances within assets ranges below $500,000 rose, while the proportion above $500,000 declined.
Graph 13: SMSF member asset sizes over 3 years
SMSF assets sustained a five year growth period to 30 June 2009, peaking in the year ended 30 June 2007 to almost $912,000, then falling 8.4% to almost $836,000 by 30 June 2009 (see appendix 1, table 10).
This compares to the median SMSF asset size by 30 June 2009 of approximately $471,000 (over $509,000 and $493,000 for 2007 and 2008 respectively).
The difference between the average and median asset figures reflects the number of SMSFs with over $1m in assets (25% in 2009).
As mentioned previously in relation to total SMSF asset growth, the fall in average and median SMSF assets (2008 and 2009) coincided with the global economic downturn.
At 30 June 2009, 49% of SMSFs had assets between $200,000 and $1 million (see appendix 1, table 11). Generally over the years ended 30 June 2005 to 30 June 2009, the proportion of SMSF assets across asset ranges follow a very similar pattern to that of SMSF members.
Graph 14 shows that for the five year period, the proportion of SMSFs holding assets of less than $500,000 fell, while the proportion of SMSFs holding greater than $500,000 in assets rose.
Graph 14: SMSF asset sizes over 5 years
In contrast, Graph 15 compares the latest three years ended 30 June 2007 to 30 June 2009. The proportion of SMSFs with assets below $1 million rose (except those holding less than $50,000) while the proportion with assets above $1 million declined.
Graph 15: SMSF asset sizes over 3 years
At 30 June 2009, the two most significant SMSF asset holdings were in Australian listed shares (29.2%) and cash and term deposits (29.7%) (see appendix 1, table 13).
Graph 16 shows that 58.9% of all SMSF assets were directly invested in these two asset classes.
Graph 16: SMSF asset allocation
Graph 17 compares the significant shifts of all SMSF asset holdings between the years ended 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2009. Generally over the two years there was a shift away from listed trusts, other managed investments and listed shares towards cash and term deposits and real property (both non-residential and residential).
In contrast, there was a corresponding increase in the proportion of SMSFs holding investments in cash and term deposits, listed shares, non-residential property and other assets in particular.
Interestingly for listed shares, there was a clear reversal of the shifts in the proportion of assets held and the proportion of SMSFs holding those assets. This indicates that there was an overall reduction in the value of holdings of listed shares over the two years, however more SMSFs invested in listed shares. This was probably a response to economic trends.
Graph 17: 2008 to 2009 Percentage change of total SMSF assets and of SMSF population holding assets by asset type
As at 30 June 2009, 76% of the SMSF sector assets were reported as directly invested by the SMSF with just under 20% invested in trusts and managed investment structures. The remaining investments held included overseas and miscellaneous assets such as collectibles or other assets (see appendix 1, table 13).
The SMSF asset types were allocated relatively evenly across the SMSFs asset ranges (see appendix 1 table 14). Note that smaller SMSFs were more likely to hold cash and term deposits than larger funds. Larger funds turned towards Australian listed shares and held a relatively larger proportion of non-residential real property and unlisted trusts.
Comparing SMSFs in the accumulation phase to the pension phase, just over 30% of SMSFs in the pension phase held almost 49% of reported assets for the year ended 30 June 2009.19
In 2009, SMSFs reporting in the pension phase had very similar assets to SMSFs in the accumulation phase (see appendix 1 table 15). The only obvious change was SMSFs in the pension phase had slightly less property and slightly more listed trust and listed share assets.
As at 30 June 2009, just below 11% of SMSFs reported holding all of their investments in one asset class, representing approximately only 5% of all SMSF assets (see appendix 1 table 16).
Smaller SMSFs were more likely to hold only one asset class (35% of those with less than $50,000 in assets). This is consistent with the fact that smaller SMSFs held the highest proportion of assets in cash and term deposits, almost 52% for those with less than $50,000 in assets (see appendix 1 table 14).
Less than 7% of SMSFs which fall within each asset range over $500,000 hold only one class of asset, (see appendix 1, table 17) indicating that as funds grow, there was a clear tendency to spread investments.
Care must be taken when using SMSF performance figures, particularly when making comparisons, as SMSF statistical data reported before 2008 is not necessarily reliable. While the methodology used to estimate SMSF performance resembles APRA's, the data collected is not the same.
Notwithstanding, the estimated return on assets (ROA) for SMSFs was positive for the year ended 30 June 2007. This was followed by negative returns in the years ended 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2009 (16.7%, -6.3% and -6.7% respectively).20
Comparisons to APRA regulated funds of more than four members showed the same trend for the three years (14.5%, -8.15 and -11.7% respectively).21
Graph 18 shows that for the years ended 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2009, most SMSFs experienced a negative ROA (almost 70% of SMSFs in 2008 and almost 72% in 2009). In both years, the highest proportion of SMSFs had ROA of -20% or less.
Graph 18: SMSF return on assets in 2008 and 2009
The estimated SMSF ROA shows a direct relationship between SMSF sizes and asset ranges. The larger the SMSF the more improved the ROA (see appendix 1, table 12).
Graph 19 shows the estimated average ROA by the SMSF size for the years ended 30 June 2007 to 30 June 2009. Overall, in 2009 the ROA for SMSFs was generally less than 2008 for all size ranges (apart from the $1 million to $2 million range).
The continued negative performance in the estimated SMSF ROA in 2009 coincides with the downturn in the world economy.
Graph 19: SMSF return on assets by fund size
As with estimated SMSF investment performance data, care must be taken when using the operating expense ratio figures as comparisons may not be meaningful. SMSF statistical data reported before 2008 is not necessarily reliable and while the methodology used to estimate the operating expense ratio is as close as possible to APRA's, the data collected is not the same (see appendix 2).
Notwithstanding, the estimated average operating expense ratio of SMSFs fell from 0.72%, to 0.67% and 0.57% over the years ended 30 June 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively.22
Average SMSF operating expenses in 2009 were almost $5,300 compared to approximately $6,000 and $6,400 in 2007 and 2008 respectively.
SMSFs with less than $50,000 in assets had a 7% average operating expense ratio compared to SMSFs with more than $500,000 in assets that had an average of less than 1% (see appendix 1, table 19).
As can be expected, graph 20 shows the estimated operating expense ratio for SMSFs declined in direct proportion to the increased size of the funds.
Graph 20: SMSF operating expense ratio by fund size
The majority of SMSFs had an estimated operating expense ratio of less than 1% (64.5% of SMSFs in 2009), the highest proportion (almost 36% in 2009) had an estimated operating expense ratio of 0.25% or less (see appendix 1, table 20).
Approved auditors play a major role in regulating SMSFs. In the year ended 30 June 2009 the average audit fee was $656.23 Average audit fees varied significantly. For those approved auditors reported as providing other services, their average fee was $942 compared to $612 for those who only completed the SMSF audit (see appendix 1, table 21).
In the year ended 30 June 2009, over 50% of SMSFs paid less than $500 to approved auditors for audit fees, while almost 4% paid $2,000 or more.
Approved auditors are required to submit to the ATO, as part of the annual audit, Auditor Contravention Reports (ACRs) that disclose SMSF contraventions according to ATO reporting guidelines. These range from administrative contraventions to more serious contraventions, such as breaches in relation to investment in in-house assets.
Overall, the percentage of the SMSF population with ACRs from the year ended 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2009 audit years has remained relatively stable at approximately 2% of all SMSFs each year.24
There were 8,126 SMSFs that had ACRs lodged containing 17,866 contraventions in the year ended 30 June 2010. Just under half of these contraventions were reported as rectified.
The most common reported contraventions were loans or financial assistance to members (20%), while in-house assets and separation of assets constitute 17% and almost 14% respectively. In monetary terms, these two contraventions represent over 25% and 28% respectively of the reported contraventions up to 2010 (see appendix 1, table 23).
The demographic of SMSFs with ACRs generally align with the SMSF population. Analysis shows there is no correlation between the receipt of an ACR and the SMSF asset size, SMSF income range, years since establishment or the structure of the SMSF.

Data limitations and differences in methodologies impact the analysis of SMSFs and any comparison of SMSF with non-SMSF sectors.
Prior to the development of the SAR for the 2008 and later income years, there were concerns about the reliability of certain statistical information reported on the annual superannuation fund return form.
In 2010 the ATO moved to a new Integrated Core Processing (ICP) system for collection and handling of its data holdings which has impacted on the reproduction of certain historical SMSF data. We will continue to improve the methodologies of reporting SMSF information, which may result in changes to figures in the future.

Thinking about self-managed super.
Setting up an SMSF.
Managing your fund's investments
You need to manage your fund's investments in the best interests of fund members and in accordance with the law. Your investments must be separate from the personal and business affairs of fund members, including yourself.
Accepting contributions
You can accept money contributions for your members from various sources but there are some restrictions, mostly depending on the member's age and whether they've exceeded the contribution caps. Generally you can't accept an asset as a contribution from a member, though there are some exceptions.
Reporting, record keeping and administration
As a trustee you'll have a number of administrative obligations - for example, you'll need to arrange an annual audit of your fund, keep appropriate records and report to us on the fund's operation.
Accessing your super
Accessing the super in your SMSF to pay benefits is generally only allowed when a member reaches what's called their 'preservation age' and meets one of the specified conditions of release - for example, they retire. There are very limited circumstances, such as death or terminal illness, where a member's super can be accessed before this. There are significant penalties for unlawfully releasing super benefits.
Understanding tax and SMSFs
The income of your SMSF is generally taxed at a concessional rate of 15%. To be entitled to this rate your fund has to be a 'complying fund' that follows the laws and rules for SMSFs.
Winding up an SMSF
At some point you may need to wind up your SMSF. This could happen if all the members and trustees have left the SMSF or all the benefits have been paid out of the fund.
Self-managed super funds - home
Overview
Accepting contributions and rollovers
Reporting, record keeping and administration
Managing your own super is a big responsibility. There are strict rules that govern how you can use a self-managed super fund (SMSF), how you can invest your money and when you can get at it.
Before deciding whether to manage your own super, think about the following.
Consider your options and seek professional advice
If you're not confident you can get a better result from an SMSF, you may be better off with a different type of fund.
Make sure you have enough assets, time and skills
To establish a competitive fund you need considerable super savings available to invest and be willing to put your own effort into managing the fund. At times you might need to consult with professionals and advisers, which adds to the cost of managing your fund.
Understand the risks and laws
All ﬁnancial decisions carry risk, so it's important to think carefully about your investment options to balance the level of risk against the level of ﬁnancial return. You also need to be sure your super investments are legal.
For more information, refer to Thinking about self-managed super.
If you set up an SMSF, you're in charge - you make your own investment decisions and you're responsible for complying with the law.
Or you can put your super in a large super fund where it's pooled with the super of other members and professionally managed by the trustees of the fund. Most people invest their super this way.
It's an important decision and the best approach for you depends on your personal situation, so we recommend you see a qualiﬁed and licensed professional to help you decide. Financial advisers, tax agents and accountants can help you understand what's involved and advise on the best option.
If you decide to set up an SMSF, make sure it's for the right reason: saving for your retirement. Don't set up an SMSF to try to get early access to your super, or to buy a holiday home or artworks to decorate your house. These things generally don't comply with super law, and schemes to get early access to super are usually illegal and fraudulent.
You'll need the money, time and skills to:
As a trustee of an SMSF, your main responsibility is to ensure you've invested your fund's money appropriately, so ask yourself:
If you're not conﬁdent you can get a better result, you may be better off leaving it to super professionals.
Costs of setting up and running an SMSF
To establish a viable SMSF that's competitive with large funds you'll need around $200,000 in super savings. Your ongoing costs will be around $2,000 to run a median-sized fund each year, including $180 each year for an annual supervisory levy.
If you set or join an SMSF, you'll also need to have adequate life insurance in case you die or you're unable to work because of an illness or accident.
There can be a big variation in the cost of setting up and running a fund. It depends on the cost of the professional accounting services you use and the cost of tax, audit and legal advice you obtain to run the fund. Life insurance can also be expensive compared to the large funds: they buy group policies that enable them to offer life insurance beneﬁts (for illness or accident) at relatively low cost.
Think carefully about your investment options and how to manage the associated risks. You need to consider:
Avoid risking all your retirement savings in one or a few investments. By spreading your investments (diversifying) you can help control the total risk of your investment portfolio.
Super funds, including SMSFs, receive signiﬁcant tax concessions as an incentive for members to save for their retirement. However, you need to follow the tax and super laws to receive these concessions.
If you decide to set up an SMSF, you're legally responsible for all the decisions made, even if you get professional advice.
When you set up an SMSF you become a trustee (or the director of a company that is a trustee).
What it means to be a trustee
A trustee is responsible for running the fund and acting in the best interests of the members. As a trustee you need to manage the fund and its investments separately from your own affairs.
How your SMSF is regulated
We administer the relevant super laws for SMSFs, work with you to help you meet your obligations and verify compliance, but we don't provide financial or investment advice.
Laws, rules and consequences
You're also responsible for running the fund according to its trust deed and the super laws. If you don't, the tax concessions that normally apply to your super may be affected and you may face penalties. Your fund must be run for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits for the members.
Steps to setting up an SMSF
Your SMSF needs to be set up correctly so that it's eligible for tax concessions, can pay benefits and is as easy as possible to administer. Here are the steps to setting up your fund:
For more information, refer to:
When you set up an SMSF, you take on the role of either a:. We expect you to:
All trustees and directors are equally responsible for managing the fund and making decisions - even if one takes a more active role in its day-to-day running.
For more information, refer to Setting up a self-managed super fund (NAT 71923).
The.
As an SMSF trustee, you must act according to your fund's trust deed and the super and tax laws. If there's a conﬂict between the super laws and the trust deed, the law overrides the trust deed.
At the heart of the super laws is a principle called the 'sole purpose test'. This means your fund needs to be maintained for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits to, we regulate SMSFs to ensure they comply with the super law. Failing to comply is known as a contravention of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SISA) or Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994 (SISR).
Our aim is to improve compliance and help you manage your SMSF. We do this through education, fund reviews and client services.
Where we find that you're genuinely making an effort to meet your obligations, we'll work with you to rectify any breaches.
Early access to super is illegal
Schemes that try to get your super money out of existing funds early are illegal and fraudulent. If you participate in one of these schemes you risk of having to pay heavy tax and legal penalties. You also won't be eligible for any compensation under super law if your super fund suffers from fraudulent conduct or theft.
Consequences of failing to comply
If you fail to perform your duties according to the laws, the tax concessions that normally apply to your super may be affected and you may face penalties.
We will take a firm approach with you if you fail to make a genuine effort to comply, or if you set out to deliberately avoid meeting your legal obligations. Depending on the severity of the breach, we may:
If we consider that the assets of your fund are at risk, we can take action to protect them. This may include:
It's a good idea to use SMSF professionals to help you. For example:
Many SMSF professionals also offer packages or kits to make the process easier. If you buy a package or kit, make sure the trust deed complies with the latest changes to the law and is specific to your fund, its objectives and the members' circumstances.
If you use an SMSF professional to help you set up your fund, you're still responsible for making sure it's done correctly.
For more information, refer to Running a self-managed super fund (NAT 11032).
You can check:
You can choose one of the following structures for your fund:
Your choice of trustee will make a difference to the way you administer your fund and the types of benefits it can pay, so you need to make sure it suits your circumstances. We recommend you discuss your trustee options with an SMSF professional.
If your fund has individual trustees, it's an SMSF if all of the following apply:
If your fund has a corporate trustee, it's an SMSF if all of the following apply:
Single member funds
It's possible for you to set up your fund with only one member.
If you have a corporate trustee for a single member fund:
You can also have two individuals as trustees. One trustee needs to be the member and the other needs to be either::
Generally, members under 18 years of age can't be trustees of a super fund. A parent or guardian can be a trustee for a member who's under 18 years of age and does not have a legal personal representative.
A company can't be a trustee if:
Penalties can apply if you act as a trustee while disqualified. 'Australian superannuation fund'. For more information, refer to Residency of self-managed super funds..
For more information, refer to Setting up a self-managed super fund (NAT 71923)..
For more information about trustee declarations or to obtain one, refer to Trustee declaration (NAT 71089).
When a member joins your fund, record their TFN. You'll need to provide each trustee's or director's TFN when you register the fund with us.
If a member hasn't quoted their TFN:
For more information about TFNs and how we tax contributions, refer to Running a self-managed super fund (NAT 11032)..
The fund's bank account needs to be kept separate from each of the trustees' individual bank accounts and any related employers' bank accounts.
Once your fund is legally established and all trustees have signed a trustee declaration, you need to register your fund with us. When registering your fund, you can:
You can register:
Electing for your fund to be regulated
For your fund to be a complying fund and receive tax concessions, you need to elect for it to be regulated and comply with the super laws.
Non-regulated funds aren't entitled to tax concessions, and the members' employers (and the members who are self-employed) can't claim deductions for contributions they make to the fund.
You need to make the election within 60 days of establishing your SMSF (generally your fund is established once the trust deed has been signed and the first contribution is made).
Getting a TFN and ABN
We allocate a tax file number (TFN) and Australian business number (ABN) to all funds that register with us.
Once we've given you an ABN, we place some of your fund's details on the Australian Business Register. Funds with an ABN are also included on Super Fund Lookup. Other super funds can use Super Fund Lookup to check whether your fund is a complying fund for transferring super benefits.
Your details may not appear on Super Fund Lookup for up to seven days while we undertake registration checks. Other super funds will not transfer super benefits while your fund's details are not on Super Fund Lookup.
Illegal early release
Early access to super is illegal. A newly registered SMSF will not automatically show as a complying fund in Super Fund Lookup. Instead it will show a status of 'Registered - status not determined'.
This status indicates that the fund has not been operational for long and has not provided enough information for the ATO to determine its compliance status. Such a fund has not been issued with a notice of compliance (NOC) as it has not yet lodged its first SMSF annual tax return.
This means additional checks will need to occur before any APRA-regulated fund will process a rollover benefit payment to an SMSF with this status.
Registering for GST
You need to register the fund for goods and services tax (GST) if its annual GST turnover is more than $75,000. Your fund needs to have an ABN to register for GST.
Most SMSFs don't have to register for GST because SMSFs mainly make input-taxed sales, and these don't count towards your GST turnover. See Goods and services tax for more information.
We regulate SMSFs. All other funds are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). For more information about our role and how we work with you and others to regulate your fund, refer to How your self-managed super fund is regulated (NAT 714.
One of your key responsibilities as a trustee is managing your fund's investments. Your investment decisions should be designed to protect and increase your members' benefits for retirement.
Your investment strategy
You invest according to your written investment strategy. This sets out your fund's investment objectives and how you plan to achieve them. It takes into account the personal circumstances of all the fund members, including their age and risk tolerance., 'arm's length' basis and don't buy assets from, or lend money to, fund members (or other related parties). Generally, your fund can't borrow money.
Ownership and protection of assets
You need to manage your fund's investments separately from the personal or business investments of members, including yourself. This includes ensuring that the fund has clear ownership of its investment assets.
The sole purpose test
The fund's investments are for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits to members - there can't be any pre-retirement benefits to members or related parties (such as letting members use an investment asset).
Investing in collectables and personal use assets
From 1 July 2011, all collectables and personal use assets purchased by SMSFs will have to comply with tightened legislative standards.
The ATO checks that you manage your investments in accordance with the super laws and will help you understand your responsibilities, but we don't provide financial or investment advice.
For more information:
When preparing your investment strategy, you need to consider:
While the super laws don't tell you what you can and can't invest in, they do set out certain investment restrictions you need to comply with.
Make your investments on a commercial, 'arm's length' basis and don't buy assets from, or lend money to, fund members (or other related parties). Any time your SMSF makes an investment, it needs to be made and maintained on a strict commercial basis. This is referred to as an 'arm's length investment'. The purchase and sale price of fund assets should always reﬂect a true market value for the asset, and the income from assets held by your fund should always reﬂect a true market rate of return.
Unless an exception applies, trustees generally can't:
The investment restrictions are some of the most important rules you need to comply with under the super laws. If you don't, we may impose significant penalties. We recommend you speak to an SMSF professional to make sure your investments comply with the law.
For more information about the investment rules, including the limited exceptions under the super laws, refer to Running a self-managed super fund (NAT 11032).
One of your trustee responsibilities is to ensure the assets of the fund are protected.
To protect fund assets in the event of a creditor dispute, and prevent costly legal action to prove who owns them, assets should be recorded in a way that:
Fund assets (other than money) should be held in the name of either:
The assets can't be held in the name of a trustee or member as an individual.
Your SMSF needs to meet the sole purpose test to be eligible for the tax concessions normally available to super funds. This means your fund needs to be maintained for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits to your members, or to their dependants if a member dies before retirement.
If you or any party directly or indirectly obtain a financial benefit when making investment decisions and arrangements (other than increasing the return to your fund), it's likely your fund will not meet the sole purpose test. When investing in collectables such as art or wine, you need to make sure that SMSF members don't have use of, or access to, the assets of the SMSF. The most common breaches of the sole purpose test are:
Tightened legislative standards apply to SMSFs investing in collectables and personal use assets. This is to ensure SMSF investments do not give rise to a current day benefit and that such investments are made for genuine retirement purposes.
These standards apply to all new investments from 1 July 2011, with all existing holdings of collectables and personal use assets to comply with these standards or be disposed of by 1 July 2016.
Contravening the sole purpose test is very serious and may lead to trustees facing civil and criminal penalties (in addition to the fund losing its concessional tax treatment).
For more information on the new legislative standards, refer to New regulations for self-managed super fund investments.
For more information about the investment rules, including the limited exceptions under the super laws, refer to Running a self-managed super fund (NAT 11032).
A contribution is a payment made to your fund in the form of money or an asset other than money (called an 'in specie' contribution). Provided the governing rules of your fund allow it, your SMSF can generally accept:
You need to properly document contributions and rollovers - including the amount, type and breakdown of components - and allocate them to the fund members' accounts within 28 days of the end of the month in which you received them.
Allowable contributions
There are minimum standards for accepting contributions. This is to ensure contributions are made for retirement purposes only. Whether a contribution is allowable depends on:
These are minimum standards - the trust deed of your fund may have more rules around accepting contributions.
In specie contributions
In specie contributions are contributions to your fund in the form of an asset, rather than money or cash.
Generally, you can't intentionally acquire assets (including in specie contributions) from related parties of your fund. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, such as listed securities and business real property acquired at market value.
Rollovers and transfers
A rollover is when a member transfers some or all of their existing super to your fund.
For more information refer to Running a self-managed super fund (NAT 11032).
There are two broad types of contributions - mandated employer contributions and non-mandated contributions.
The amount of contributions made for a member is subject to contributions caps.
Mandated employer contributions
Mandated employer contributions are those made by an employer under a law or an industrial agreement for the benefit of a fund member. They include super guarantee contributions.
You can accept mandated employer contributions for members at any time, regardless of their age or the number of hours they're working at that time.
Non-mandated contributions
Non-mandated contributions include:
Whether you can accept a non-mandated contribution depends on the member's age and circumstances. For example, for members under 65 years of age, you can generally accept all types of contributions (subject to the relevant contribution caps), but for members 75 and over you can't accept any non-mandated contributions. For some types of contributions you can only accept the contribution if the member quotes their tax file number (TFN).
Contribution caps
Contribution caps apply to contributions made for a fund member in a financial year. Contributions that are within the caps generally receive significant tax concessions. There are different caps for:
The caps are indexed annually.
The contribution caps are listed in Key superannuation rates and thresholds.
For more information about contribution caps and allowable contributions, refer to Running a self-managed super fund (NAT 11032).
In specie contributions are contributions to your fund in the form of an asset, rather than money or cash.
Generally, you can't intentionally acquire assets (including in specie contributions) from related parties of your fund. However, there are some significant exceptions to this rule, including:
For more information about acquiring assets from related parties, see Managing your fund's investments.
A member's super benefits can generally be rolled over or transferred within the super system with their consent.
If you accept a rollover of benefits from another super fund, that fund can ask you to show that your fund is a complying fund before processing your request.
For a current listing of regulated complying super funds, visit Super Fund Lookup at
For more information about the reporting requirements for rolling over or transferring benefits, see Paying benefits to members.
Employment termination payments
Most employment termination payments (previously known as eligible termination payments) can no longer be rolled over into super. However, some transitional arrangements apply.
Generally, transitional termination payments are employment termination payments received after 1 July 2007 that an employee was entitled to receive in an employment contract that existed before 10 May 2006. Transitional termination payments need to be made before 1 July 2012 and can be contributed or rolled over into a super fund.
As a trustee of your SMSF you need to:
As a trustee of an SMSF, you're required to appoint an approved, independent auditor to audit your fund each year, at least 30 days before the auditor must give a report to the trustee. The auditor report must be given to the trustee by the day before the fund is required to lodge its SMSF annual return. Your auditor is required to:
You should appoint your auditor early to allow enough time to do the audit and lodge the SMSF annual return on time.
An audit is still required even if no contributions or payments were made in that income year.
Before an auditor can start to audit, you or your SMSF professional need to prepare information about your accounts and transactions for the previous financial year. This information is then sent to the approved auditor.
All SMSFs need to lodge an SMSF annual return with us each year, in order to:
The lodgment and (where applicable) payment dates are:
You can't lodge the SMSF annual return until the audit of your SMSF has been finalised, as information from the audit report is required to complete the regulatory information in the return.
Failure to lodge your SMSF annual return by the due date can result in penalties and the loss of your SMSF's tax concessions.
To download the SMSF annual return (NAT 71226) and instructions (NAT 71606), refer to Self-managed superannuation fund annual return.
Newly registered self-managed super funds
If your fund is newly registered but has not begun operating, you may not have to lodge an annual return or pay the supervisory levy of $180.
You can ask us to cancel the ABN, which can be re-registered when the fund has assets that are set aside for the benefit of members. If the fund has now received a contribution or a rollover amount, you can notify us in writing or by fax on 1300 550 356 advising us that the SMSF:

Amending your SMSF annual return
To amend any part of your SMSF annual return, you need to lodge a complete amended return:
You can't request amendments via written correspondence or by using the form Request for amendment of income tax return lodged by tax professionals (NAT 71837).
The SMSF annual return is more than an income tax return. You also provide important regulatory information and contributions information about each member. This information is inter-related - changing one label on the form is likely to require labels in other sections of the form to be amended too. For this reason we need you to always complete the form in full, not just the parts you want to amend, and provide contributions information for all members, not just the member whose contributions you need to change.
For example, suppose an SMSF annual return overstates the employer contributions reported for one of its two members by $1,000 due to an arithmetic error made when preparing the return. To correct the error a new annual return is lodged reporting all information as previously reported, but with amendments to:
You can obtain a paper version of the SMSF annual return (NAT 71226) by:
When rolling over benefits and current year contributions, you need to complete a Rollover benefits statement (NAT 70944) and provide copies to the receiving fund (or funds) and the member whose benefits are being rolled over.
The Rollover benefits statement allows the receiving fund to:
You need to check that the rollover is to a complying fund.
You can download a copy of the Rollover benefits statement (NAT 70944) and the accompanying instructions How to complete a rollover benefits statement (NAT 70945).
You can check whether the receiving fund is a regulated complying super fund using Super Fund Lookup at
One of your responsibilities as a trustee of an SMSF is to keep proper and accurate tax and super records to manage your fund efficiently.
It's a good idea to take minutes of all investment decisions, including:
If, as one of the fund's trustees, you invest the SMSF's money in an investment that fails, the other trustees could take action against you for failing to be diligent in your duties. However, if your investment decision was recorded in meeting minutes that were signed by the other trustees, you will have a record to show the other trustees agreed with your actions.
You need to make certain records available to your fund's approved auditor when they audit your fund each year. You may also need to provide accurate records to the ATO if we ask to see them.
You need to keep the following records for a minimum of five years:
You need to keep the following records for a minimum of 10 years:
Don't forget that income tax record-keeping requirements also need your attention - especially documents on deductions, capital gains tax and losses.
As a trustee of an SMSF, you need to notify us within 28 days if there is a change in:
You also need to notify us within 28 days if the fund is being wound up.
To tell us about changes to your SMSF, either:
You can't use the SMSF annual return to tell us about a change in the structure of your SMSF.
The super in your fund is intended for your members' retirement and generally can't be accessed until then.
Preserved and non-preserved benefits
Most of the super held in your fund will be in the form of preserved benefits. These must be preserved in the fund until the law and your fund's trust deed allows them to be paid.
Preservation age
Preservation age is generally the age that a person can access their super benefits. permit early access to super benefits before a member reaches their preservation age, but these occur only in limited circumstances, such as terminal illness or permanent incapacity.
Paying benefits
Payment of benefits is usually as a lump sum or an income stream (that is, a pension).
If a benefit is unlawfully released, the ATO may apply significant penalties to you, your SMSF and the recipient of the early release.
All contributions made by or on behalf of a member, and all earnings for the period after 30 June 1999, are preserved benefits. Employer eligible termination payments (before 1 July 2007) rolled over into a super fund are also preserved benefits.
Preserved benefits may be cashed voluntarily only if a condition of release is met and then subject to any cashing restrictions imposed by the super laws. Cashing restrictions tell you what form the benefits need to be taken in.
There are two other types of benefits:
Preservation age is generally the age that you can access your super benefits. A person's preservation age depends on their date of birth, as set out in the following table.
Several of the conditions of release require that the member has reached their preservation age.
Conditions of release are the events your member needs to satisfy to withdraw benefits from their super fund. The conditions of release are also subject to the rules of your SMSF (as set out in the trust deed). It's possible that a benefit may be payable under the super laws, but can't be paid under the rules of your SMSF.
The most common conditions of release for paying out benefits are:
There are a number of other circumstances in which benefits can be released, such as incapacity, severe financial hardship, temporary residents leaving Australia, terminal illness or injury, and terminating gainful employment. Some of these permit early access to benefits before reaching preservation age. There are specific rules for each of these and some have restrictions on the way the benefits can be cashed.
Generally, rollovers or transfers to other super funds don't require a condition of release to be satisfied, subject to the governing rules of your SMSF. However, money rolled over from an employer into a super fund (before 1 July 2007) is preserved and can generally be cashed once the member reaches preservation age and meets a condition of release.
Early access or release of preserved benefits and restricted non-preserved benefits is permitted in very limited circumstances and may include:
For information about releasing super early under severe financial hardship, on compassionate grounds, permanent or temporary incapacity or due to a terminal medical condition, contact your super fund first.
You can also refer to Conditions of release to access your super before retirement (including natural disasters).
For more information about APRA and early-release applications:
Trustees should consider their obligations when allowing/considering early access such as:
Setting up or using an SMSF to gain improper early access to super is illegal. If a benefit is unlawfully released, the ATO may apply significant penalties to you, your SMSF and the recipient of the early release.
Beware of promoters who claim they can help you access your retirement benefits, such as for buying a house, car or a holiday or for solving your financial problems. These schemes are illegal and there are severe penalties if you access your super before you're legally entitled to.
For more information, refer to Running a self-managed super fund (NAT 11032).
For more detailed information about access to benefits on compassionate grounds contact the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) Infoline on 1300 131 060.
Benefits from a super fund may generally be paid as a lump sum, income stream (pension) or annuity, provided the member has satisfied a condition of release (for example, retirement).
When paying benefits you may have administrative obligations such as withholding tax or obtaining an actuary's certificate.
Income streams
Income streams need to be either account-based or non account-based.
Account-based income streams have the following general characteristics:
A new account-based transition to retirement income stream may be started on or after 1 July 2007. These income streams need to meet the standards of ordinary account-based income streams but are also required to have a maximum annual payment limit of 10% of the account balance. Commutations of these pensions can't be taken in cash except in limited circumstances.
Non account-based income streams have the following general characteristics:
Before starting to pay any income stream, we recommend that you seek the advice of a professional such as an accountant, financial planner or actuary.
PAYG withholding and administrative obligations
You may have to withhold tax from benefit payments. This happens if the payment is to a member less than 60 years of age, or to a member 60 years of age or more and the benefit is from an untaxed source.
If you have to withhold tax from a benefit payment to a member, you need to:
You don't need to provide a payment summary if the payment is a lump sum because the member has a terminal illness or injury.
If you're paying income streams to members, you can claim a tax exemption for fund income that is related to paying the fund's current pension liabilities. To do this you may need a certificate from an actuary to work out the amount of exempt income from assets that support the pension payments.
SMSFs are subject to income tax but receive concessional treatment, provided they are complying funds. A complying SMSF's assessable income is generally taxed at a rate of 15%, while for a non-complying fund the rate is 45%. The most common types of assessable income for complying SMSFs are:
However, certain types of SMSF income are taxed at different rates:.
Certain contributions received by a complying SMSF are included in its assessable income and are usually taxed as part of the SMSF's income at 15%. These 'assessable contributions' include:.
For more information, refer to Self-managed super funds and tax exemptions on pension assets.
Your SMSF's assessable income includes any net capital gains, under the capital gains tax (CGT) provisions. A net capital gain is:
Complying SMSFs are entitled to a CGT discount of one-third, if the relevant asset was.
For more information, refer to Capital gains tax essentials.
Member assets
A member may decide to sell an asset to generate cash to make contributions to your super fund, or contribute assets rather than cash to your super fund - known as an 'in specie' contribution. In either situation, the member will trigger a capital gains tax (CGT) event when they sell or transfer the asset. This means the member may have to pay CGT.
Non-arm's length income is taxed at 45%.
SMSFs are required to invest on a commercial, 'arm's length' basis. The purchase and sale price of fund assets should always reflect a true market value for the asset, and the income from assets held by your fund should always reflect a true market rate of return. SMSFs generally can't:
Broadly, an amount of ordinary income or statutory income is non-arm's length income of a complying SMSF if:
Like other taxpayer entities, a complying SMSF is entitled to deduct from its assessable income any losses or outgoings that are:
Expenses that a complying SMSF can deduct include:
Losses and outgoings relating to exempt current pension income are generally not deductible because they are incurred in earning exempt income.
If you carry on an enterprise, you must register for GST if your GST turnover is $75,000 or more.
However, most SMSFs don't have to register for GST because most SMSFs mainly make input-taxed supplies, which don't count towards your GST turnover. Input taxed supplies include financial supplies and supplies of residential premises by way of rent or sale.
However, you may choose to register for GST.
In deciding whether to register voluntarily, you should consider:
Your SMSF must register for GST if it makes supplies, other than input-taxed supplies, that exceed the GST turnover of $75,000.
For more information, refer to GST and financial supplies for self managed super funds.
To wind up your SMSF you need to:
There are a number of reasons why you might need to wind up your SMSF:
In some cases you'll be able to pay beneﬁts to members when you wind up your SMSF. In other cases the members won't be able to, or won't want to, take their beneﬁts so you'll need to roll them over to another super fund.
Once the fund is wound up, it can't be reactivated.
For more information, refer to Winding up a self-managed super fund (NAT 8107).
You need to let us know within 28 days of the fund being wound up.
You need to do this in writing and include:
Send your letter to:
Australian Taxation Ofﬁce
PO Box 3578
ALBURY NSW 2640
You need to make sure that:
If you've wound up your fund and haven't met a condition of release, you can't access your super. Your super needs to be rolled over into another complying super fund.
There are serious penalties for using your super before you are legally allowed.
There may be capital gains tax implications on the disposal of assets when you are paying benefits or rolling over benefits to another fund. For more information, refer to Capital gains tax essentials.
When winding up your fund you still need to have an audit completed before you can lodge your annual return.
You need to lodge your SMSF annual return and complete all labels at item 9, 'Was the fund wound up during the income year?'
You must also ﬁnalise payment of any outstanding tax liabilities at this time and lodge any outstanding returns from previous years.
For more information, refer to Self managed superannuation fund annual return instructions (NAT 71606).
If you need to lodge a return for any year before 2008, call us on 13 10 20 for help.
It's important to wind up your fund correctly. If you don't lodge the required reports it's likely our compliance team will contact you to do so. If you fail to carry out these responsibilities, you may be selected for further compliance activities. You may also be subject to penalties.
Conﬁrmation of your wound up fund
To conﬁrm that you've met all of your tax responsibilities, we'll send you a letter stating that we have:
Don't close your SMSF bank accounts until you've received this confirmation from us - otherwise you won't be able to bank any refund you're entitled to.

Wholesome goodness and fun in nature's package! This is the greatest snack: popcorn that is still on the cob. Place the cob into the bag provided and microwave for 2 minutes. The bag will fill with popcorn without salt or oil. You can add butter if you wish after it is popped.
When we popped a cob at our home, it had about 20 kernels left on it that were captured in various stages of "POP." We were all fascinated to see what the kernels look like as they explode.
You will really enjoy this tasty, Kansas grown popcorn. Terrific as stocking stuffers, birthday party favors and just for the yummy entertainment of it!

Around the age of 2, children begin learning the basic skills of threading and unthreading. Stitching the apple with its wooden worm firmly attached with a long rainbow ribbon, is great practice and great fun. It is 5 inches across and tall, 1/2 inch thick.
This apple is handmade by a local dad from old Walnut trees planted 150 years ago by homesteaders in Northern California. The trees were raised organically and were only cut down when they stopped producing fruit and needed to be replaced. The edges are burnished but there is no oil used on these, the wood is unoiled.

AT&T Survey: Businesses in Canada's Commercial Capital Place High Priority on Disaster Preparedness and Recovery
AT&T Business Continuity Study Reveals Local Businesses Are Prepared For Unexpected Disaster, Proactively Investing in Security
Toronto, Canada, May 02, 2012
As one of Canada’s primary commercial centres, Toronto requires increasingly complex network infrastructure for its major industries, which include finance, telecommunications, education, and medical research. To ensure that these services continue uninterrupted, IT executives in the city must be prepared for diverse threats like extreme weather, ‘virtual’ events like security breaches and power outages – the effects of which still resonate with local businesses that lost power in the Northeast Blackout of 2003.
A recent AT&T study indicates that a vast majority (85%) of Toronto-area companies have developed business continuity plans to help identify, prevent and respond to adverse conditions, a third of whom are saying it has become a priority in recent years due to natural disasters and security issues. The survey shows that this level of preparedness has extended beyond theoretical threats for a plurality (44%) of companies who have had to invoke their business continuity plans in the past year.
Despite a volatile economy, businesses continue to invest in new technologies. Six out of ten (59%) Toronto executives surveyed indicate that in 2012 their companies will make strategic investments in areas like mobile applications (37%), cloud computing (35%) and security solutions (27%). Cloud computing has become a particular focus – a majority (57%) of executives are either currently using cloud or considering using it as part of their business continuity strategy. When it comes to disaster recovery, executives would most frequently use cloud computing for data storage (40%) and Web servers (37%).
AT&T recognizes the risks associated with unexpected external threats and offers a wide array of business continuity services, encompassing disaster planning, risk management, recovery preparedness and communications readiness. In times of severe network damage that exceeds the capacity of local resources, AT&T deploys its Network Disaster Recovery (NDR) team that can rapidly recover vital networks services in an effort that would otherwise take weeks or months.
“Today’s businesses are more connected than ever and it is essential that communities and leading organizations continue to prepare for and establish a response to these unexpected situations,” said Kelly Morrison, Senior Technical Specialist, AT&T NDR. “AT&T responds to these threats to help restore vital telecommunications services for our business and government customers following a disaster.”
For the first time since 1997, AT&T will be conducting a full-scale NDR simulation from May 4 through May 7 at Toronto’s Canadian National Exhibition Grounds.
Held several times a year throughout North America, these NDR exercises simulate the loss of a network office due to disaster and are designed to test, refine and strengthen AT&T’s business continuity and disaster recovery services in order to minimize network downtime.
Business Continuity Study Key Findings
AT&T’s 2012 Business Continuity Study found that businesses in the Greater Toronto Area are preparing for potential disasters and investing in additional technology:
- The vast majority (85%) of local companies surveyed already have a business continuity plan in place.
- Six out of ten (60%) have tested their continuity plan in the last 12 months.
- A plurality (44%) has invoked their business plan in the last 12 months.
- More than two thirds (69%) suggest they implement specific protective actions when the federal or provincial government issues an alert for an impending disaster.
- Eighty five per cent (85%) indicate the complexity of network infrastructure is increasing.
- Nearly eight out of ten (79%) report their IT budgets will be higher in 2012 than in the previous two years.
- A majority (52%) indicate cloud computing is currently part of their corporate infrastructure.
For more information on the 2012 AT&T Business Continuity Study, including complete research results visit
Study methodology
The results are based on an online survey of 100 Information Technology (IT) executives in Toronto, Canada. The study was conducted by Research Now with companies having total revenues of more than $25 million (except for government entities). Surveys were obtained between March 15 and 23, 2012.
AT&T NDR Program
This week’s NDR exercise at the Canadian National Exhibition Grounds in Toronto includes an extensive deployment of AT&T’s network recovery equipment. The exercise tests and refines the team’s speed and efficiency in restoring wireline and wireless network operations in the event of an actual disaster. Essential to AT&T’s own comprehensive business continuity plan, the Toronto NDR exercise features the following disaster recovery equipment: a total of 24 pieces of disaster recovery equipment, including:
- Three technology recovery trailers
- A portable, satellite communications system used for first-in, emergency communications
- A 53’ incident command/team support trailer
This exercise marks AT&T’s second exercise in the Greater Toronto Area; the last local exercise was held in 1997..

Since model year 2004, the S4 sedan and S4 Avant are both equipped with a new, two-stage braking system. For normal deceleration, the servo ratio is 5.5:1, meaning the amount of braking pressure being applied by the driver is multiplied by a factor of 5.5. When rapid deceleration is called for and the driver rapidly engages the braking mechanism, the servo ratio more than doubles to a remarkable 12:1 for extraordinarily enhanced stopping power.

"Well worth listening to"
This was my first purchase from audible and it was certainly value for money. Brilliantly read and thoroughly compelling. For any Dickens fan this is well worth a listen.
"Bleak House"
I enjoyed this book as it was read by two different people so you didnt get bored with the reader. I love Charles Dickens books. I will be ordering others books of his. The next one will be Oliver Twist.
.
"Intriguing Masterpiece"
This is a wonderful web of life lines that Dickens weaves with sublime expertise. At the back of it is his loathing of the corrupt and inefficient legal system, but the dual narration constantly leaves you wondering just who knows what. It has prompted me to revisit the wonderful BBC series of 2006, where Gillian Anderson plays Lady Dedlock. Having recently enjoyed Little Dorrit I was apprehensive that Bleak House might not have been as good, but I need not have worried.
Not only is this a great work of literature, but the two actors are superb, voicing each of the many characters carefully and amusingly.

"I could not listen to the narrator"
I usually enjoy the Dexter books but I could not get past the first 15 minutes of this book because the sound quality is extremely poor (on a scale of 1 to 10 - I would give it a minus 1 million - it's really that bad) and the narrator does an even worse job. Really, really bad job and impossible to hear/listen to. I am considering contacting audible about a refund it is so badly produced. Just terrible.!!!

"This was my last Dexter Book"
The plot was SO thin and the story dragged on and on and on. I actually fast forwarded through a lot of it (a first for me & I listen to A LOT of audio books).. and didn't miss a single thing.
The author did a horrible job writing it and then he completely butchered the reading. I do believe this was the poorest narration on an audio book that I've ever heard.
There is nothing good about this book. Not one thing.
"Double Delight!"
I would recommend this book to anyone with a dark side to their humor.
I just love sister Deb. The way she says exactly what she thinks is hilarious and liberating.
I hated to have to pull myself away from thi book. There is a definite need to know what happens next.
I want more!
"Dexter does it again!"
The new storyline was great!
More Dexter!
I'm generally not a fan of authors who narrate their own work. There's some very talented actors & talented authors. I've yet to find that one person is both. Lindsay is capable, but i believe his abilities lay in writing.
More Dexter!
"Wonderfully wicked, and morbidly perverse!"
I love Dexter -- his gallows humor, his psychopathic insights into evil, and his amazingly insightful perception of human nature is what keeps me coming back to this series. I don't like the television series much -- but the books are worth the read! This one is no exception -- another Dexter classic of perverse entertainment.
The evil twin of the Harry Bosch series.
Excellent reading performance. Lindsay really brings Dexter to life.

She taught him about meat, predators, and survival - but not about his greatest and least predictable adversary - man. When the cruel Indian Gray Beaver captures him, White Fang is separated from his mother and forced to fight other camp dogs to survive. But things get even worse when Gray Beaver sells him to the cowardly Beauty Smith, who trains White Fang to hate by destroying other dogs in his pen. As his memories of Kiche and the laws she taught him fade, White Fang becomes little more than a vicious animal, but still yearns for the freedom of his early life.

Adaptive air suspension is an electronically controlled air suspension system at all four wheels with a continuously adaptive damping system. It unites sporty handling with a high level of ride comfort. In addition, the air suspension allows for speed-dependent lowering of the body – a change in ride height that results in a low center of gravity and significantly increased directional stability. The vehicle’s aerodynamics are improved at the same time.
The vehicle has air suspension struts on all four wheels. The data from sensors on the axles and acceleration sensors on the body is evaluated in the adaptive air suspension's central control unit. This computer controls the adjustment of the individual shock absorbers in milliseconds, depending on driving situation. Provided no higher damping forces are required – for instance, when driving straight ahead on good roads – the damper settings remain comfortably soft.
Controlled changes to the damping force at individual wheels help to eliminate body movements at any time which could reduce occupant comfort. The adaptive damping system automatically reduces rolling or pitching movements when cornering, braking or driving off-road. Adaptive air suspension moreover offers the advantages of a traditional self-leveling suspension system. The vehicle's suspension height remains constant irrespective of the load it is carrying.
The adaptive air suspension generally also allows the driver to influence the suspension characteristic – and thus the operating dynamics – as individually preferred. The damping characteristics and ride height can be adjusted in a single process via the MMI "CAR" menu system. Available as an option in the Audi A8 and Audi Q7.

The latest generation of anti-theft alarms feature warning horns that operate independently of the cars' own electrical systems, as well as time-controlled alarms that sound if a door is opened without authorization. Locking the car activates the alarm; unlocking the car turns it off. Some Audi models include tilt sensors in the anti-theft system, which detect any change in the car’s position (theft by transporting it) and sound the alarm. Initially the horn sounds for 30 seconds. In addition, the emergency flashers work continuously.

The hood compartment can be folded upwards in a single action to provide 11.12 cu. ft. of luggage space for journeys into the sun. Even when the hood compartment is folded down to stow the soft top, and protect it from dust, 8.69 cu. ft. still provide sufficient storage space.

Department
of Linguistics
The
Departmentment of Linguistics came into being in 1995 with the
aim of developing a better understanding of language study and
linguistics. With the diverse linguistics scenario in North-
East India providing its backdrop, the thrust of the
department's endeavour has been on analyzing the languages of
North-East India with special reference to the languages of
South Assam. The department is also giving as a lot of minoroty
languages are spoken in this part ofthe country which is
considered to be endangered so that we can do something meaning
to preserve these. All the Noth Easter Languages show dialectal
variations which need to be studied structurally as well as
sociolinguistically. Such studies would help the standardization
of languages and pave ways for their use in education and other
fields of Socio-culture life of North East India. Keeping this
in view, the department has developed its course curriculum in
such a way so as to enable students at the Post Graduate level
to acquire capabilities to take up independent researches in
future on various languages and their recent developments.

According to a report in Auto Express, Lamborghini has finally admitted that it will be revealing an early take on its new model, an SUV, at the Beijing Auto Show in April. Said to have "a high-rise version of the Estoque" front end, two doors and punched-out rear wheel arches, it will sit on the same platform as the Volkswagen Group's other premium SUVs from Audi, Porsche, VW and possibly Bentley.
A bit of oddity is that Auto Express pegs the name as the MLC. If such is the case, perhaps its a return to the only other SUV naming convention Lamborghini's had, the alphanumeric LM002, but "MLC" strikes us as a bland, sexless waste of a chance to append something brutishly and memorably taurean.
Speculation all along has been that the MLC would get a retuned version of the V10 from the Gallardo. If the output of the MLC's mill is 584-horsepower as per the report, that would be 41 horses beyond the Gallardo. A hybrid model to follow would get that over the 600-hp mark. Production is rumored to happen in 2015, with an estimated $200,000 price tag putting it well above anything that isn't from Bentley or Russia.
And for those who still dream of an Estoque, the MLC might not be the only Lamborghini borrowing a platform. The arrow-nosed four-door Estoque is said to remain under consideration, and just as the Cayenne led to the Panamera, a production Estoque could be prepared based on the next-generation Panamera's underpinnings.

Lender's mistake lets store founder off the hook
A Wisconsin bank can't collect on a dealership co-founder's $3 million personal guaranty even though the dealership defaulted on floorplan and real estate loans, a Wisconsin Court of Appeals panel has ruled.
Mid-Wisconsin Bank can't enforce the guaranty because it didn't obtain a first-lien position on the assets subject to the loans as promised, the three-member panel ruled.
The unanimous decision clears Richard Smith, co-founder and a shareholder of the now closed dealership, of potential liability.
In 2005, Smith Brothers Ford Inc. in Mosinee, Wis., needed refinancing. Its lender had declared the store in default after discovering that collateral had been double-financed. Smith applied to Mid-Wisconsin Bank to refinance its obligations.
After a loan appraisal, Mid-Wisconsin approved more than $9 million in refinancing, with inventory and real estate as collateral and a $3 million guaranty signed by Smith. At the time, the bank's commercial loan officer told Smith and his son, the company president, that the bank would obtain first-lien position on the dealership's collateral by paying off a prior loan from Advantage Community Bank.
Later, however, it was discovered that Advantage was still in first position on the collateral with $1.7 million in loans. Mid-Wisconsin's loan officer claimed that his failure to obtain the first-lien position was an oversight. Even so, he was terminated for negligence.
After Smith Brothers Ford defaulted on Mid-Wisconsin's loans, the bank sued Smith to recover on his guaranty. A Marathon County Circuit Court judge ruled against the bank and rescinded the guaranty.
In affirming that decision, the appeals court said the bank "concedes its agent falsely represented that Mid-Wisconsin would obtain first priority on the business collateral" and that Smith stated under oath that "he would never have agreed to the guaranty if Mid-Wisconsin had not assured him it would obtain first position on the business collateral."
The court said Smith was entitled to rely on the loan officer's statement and that "the misrepresentation dramatically altered Smith's calculation of the transaction's risk."
Smith's lawyer, Randall Nesbitt of Sturgeon Bay, Wis., said the decision means that a lender's "failure to act aboveboard is going to release guarantors from their obligations."
The bank did not appeal further, and the time to appeal has expired, according to the bank's lawyer, Mark Sauer of Wausau, Wis.
Sauer also said the appeal didn't affect a $4 million-plus jury award the bank won against Smith's son, company president, and Smith's daughter, company principal, for intentional misrepresentation and conspiracy. The time to appeal has passed, Sauer said, adding that the award still hasn't been paid.
Outcome: Appeals court says no, citing the bank's failure to secure a first-lien position on the store's collateral.

If you own a vintage vehicle, chances are the original windshield has seen better days. Years of use and abuse, especially from worn wipers, have taken a toll on it by forming scratches in an otherwise perfectly good windshield. But how do you resolve the problem?
You could change the windshield. This sounds great until you laundry list the pros and cons. Changing it will yield a nice clear windshield. But in doing so, you’ve replaced a windshield that might have very important factory markings. It will also require the weatherstripping to be replaced, and chances are if you car doesn’t have a water leak now, there’s a good chance it will after the windshield is replaced. There’s an additional concern on early Mustangs due to the design of the headliner, which wraps around the upper windshield flange. The weatherstrip surrounds the flange. If the headliner is original, it’s more than likely brittle and any disruption around it could tear the headliner. Lastly, there aren’t many windshield replacement shops that regularly change 45-year-old windshields. Many are unfamiliar with molding removal so in addition to buying a new windshield and weatherstrip, you might wind up buying new windshield moldings. The bottom line is that replacing a windshield is an expensive way to get rid of scratches.
An excellent alternative is to use Eastwood Products’ Glass Polishing Kit. The kit is designed to remove years of wiper haze and minor scratches from glass. Keep in mind it won’t remove deep scratches. A deep scratch is identified as one that will catch your fingernail. If the scratches aren’t deep, then the glass polishing kit is the way to go. The great thing about it is the cost is minimal and using it avoids the pitfalls of replacing a windshield.
We decided to try the kit on this 1965 Mustang. Forty-five years of wiper blades moving back and forth had created several large scratches directly in front of the driver. While the scratches were noticeable, they passed the fingernail test. The project took about two hours to complete and the end result was amazing. The scratches were eliminated completely at a cost much lower than if the windshield was replaced.
This is Eastwood's windshield scratch removal kit. It includes polishing compound, polishing wheel, adapter shaft and a variety of abrasive discs. The discs are used with severely scratched windshields and were not needed for this windshield repair.
The windshield had two wiper scratches on the driver side. The photo shows the most severe scratch. Keep in mind, if the scratch is deep enough to catch your fingernail when moved over the scratch, the windshield should be replaced.
Using a crayon or tape, mark the scratch locations on the inside of the glass.
Remove the windshield wiper arms.
Cover the car to avoid getting the glass compound on the body and to reduce cleanup time. Carefully cut an opening around the windshield and tape the covering to the windshield molding.
Clean the windshield thoroughly.
Soak the polishing wheel in ½-inch of water for 5 minutes. Do not oversoak, as it may swell the wheel unevenly.
The polishing compound contains silica. A large amount of silica dust is generated in this process. It is important not to breathe in the dust. Wear a properly fitting dust mask prior to use.
In a clean container, mix the compound in a 1:1 ratio with water or until it becomes the consistency of gravy.
Moisten windshield with water.
Insert the wheel into a drill having a maximum speed of 1,500 rpm. Apply the compound directly to the scratch and polish at 600 to 1,500 rpm with light steady pressure. Rewet polishing wheel frequently to keep the compound wet and to avoid heat build-up which can crack the glass.
After polishing, clean the glass to determine if all of the scratches have been eliminated. If scratches remain, reapply compound and polish a second time.
After all of the scratches have been removed, remove crayon markings from the windshield.
Remove the plastic cover and clean the windshield.
Re-install windshield wipers and you're finished. The best part is all of the money you saved.
The repaired windshield is scratch free.

About 40 years ago somebody put a radio into 1 VEV. Today such vandalism seems mad, but perhaps it made sense then. During its recent restoration at RS Williams, they found the evidence. It had been covered up in later years but there, deep inside, were the holes that had been cut to take a 1960s car radio and its speaker.
Whoever was responsible didn’t quite have the gall to desecrate the handmade Zagato body by drilling an antenna hole through it but, as Richard Williams told me: ‘Concealed antennas were available then. Perhaps it had one of them.’
The pair of Aston Martin DB4GT Zagatos, registered 1 VEV and 2 VEV on May 19, 1961, and campaigned by John Ogier’s Essex Racing Stable, have long been a legendary part of Aston Martin history. Heroically, they went into battle against the dominant Ferraris after the Works ceased racing officially. First they faced the 250GT SWB but then along came the fabulous 250GTO, which of course turned out to be one of the greatest GT racing cars ever made.
As the Astons were about 12% heavier than a 250GT SWB, they became instant underdogs. The DB4GT Zagatos were magnificent thoroughbreds but they just weren’t quick enough. When the GTO appeared in 1962, it got worse: the Astons were then 18% heavier than the opposition. To be brutally honest, the position became steadily more hopeless for the Astons.
Nevertheless, Ogier gave it his best shot. He ran a superb team, he hired the best drivers and 1 VEV and 2 VEV came out fighting. Unfortunately the account opened very badly when the brand new pair retired early in the 1961 Le Mans 24 Hours. Both suffered head gasket failure because the heads had not been properly tightened down. But that simple cock-up made no real difference to the race result. One hour in, Ferrari held the first four places and the new Astons were fading away without ever being near the top ten.
A couple of outdated DBR1s were lying seventh and eighth early on, but not one Aston Martin finished the race – a sorry tale after the Works team’s glorious outright one-two with the DBR1s in 1959.
Ogier’s team got a great boost in their next race, the GT event supporting the British GP at Aintree. In damp conditions, Australian driver Lex Davison, in 2 VEV, gambled on the right tires and seized the lead from Jack Sears on the very last lap to win by just 1.2 seconds. Jack should have been driving a Ferrari 250GT but an unfortunate mechanic had smashed it up, driving to Aintree on the road. Different days indeed! Jack raced an E-type instead, a near-standard car with its soft-top raised, and very nearly won. The famous Lightweight E-types, which certainly were a match for the 250GTOs, were yet to come.
In fact, there was no Ferrari opposition in that 1961 Aintree race, the other 250GT also having been crashed before the start. One of our most respected magazines then made a blunder by reporting: ‘Whitmore brought the other Essex Aston Martin Zagato home third.’ John Whitmore did finish third, but he drove the Essex team’s standard DB4GT, not a Zagato, and he was on dry tires. It had looked like the smart choice but he was out of luck.
As things turned out, 1 VEV was never beaten by its team mate, 2 VEV. Back then, the chief mechanic in the Essex Racing Stable was Ian Moss. Now 70, and still extremely active – he’s a keen badminton player – Ian recalls the 1961 and 1962 seasons clearly:
‘1 VEV was the car we used for most of the work. When testing, it was 1 VEV that we normally took. Those cars were perhaps half a hundredweight lighter than standard as they had no bumpers, lightweight racing seats and some interior panels had been left out in the build. The Ferraris were much lighter, had better traction and a much stiffer chassis. The way I saw it, Ferrari made a racing car and adapted it for the road while Aston took a road car and converted it for racing.’
Half a hundredweight equates to 25.4kg: in other words, not a lot. A DB4GT Zagato was lighter than a standard DB4 but, as we have seen, it was always an overweight racer. There was also plenty of bullshit over horsepower. Ian says:‘Despite official claims, 1 VEV never had more than 270bhp in those days. Horsepower figures sell cars, but torque wins races!’ Aston Martin tweaked its straight-six 3670cc engine up to a compression ration of 9.7:1 for the Zagato and claimed 314bhp but nobody today denies the true figure was well short of that. Ian says they did see 310bhp from one engine much later on but it was a 3.9-liter, which went into the second 2 VEV after the original was wrecked at Spa in 1962.
Perhaps 1 VEV’s finest moment came in its second race, the 1961 RAC Tourist Trophy at Goodwood. Roy Salvadori gave chase to the Ferraris and after 108 laps he finished a mere three seconds behind Mike Parkes’ 250GT. It was a glorious result, even though he was ‘only’ a close third because Stirling Moss, in another Ferrari 250GT, finished a lap ahead of the entire field. That sort of performance was rather expected of Stirling then.
Recalling it, Roy says: ‘Compared to a GTO or an E-type, the Aston Zagatos were much heavier to drive. You had to really thrash them to get the times down, but it was a wonderful team to be part of. We worked hard at our pit stops but somehow we always seemed to be stationary a little longer than opposition, and that car was really hard on tires.’ He wasn’t kidding:
I looked it up and found that Roy had 14 new tires fitted during that Goodwood race, and no punctures! Behind him, and another lap down we should note, were Jim Clark in 2 VEV and Innes Ireland in a normal DB4GT.
But stop a moment, this is known history. What are we really talking about when we consider such famous, well-documented cars today? What is there new to say? Nearly 20 years ago, when I was on another magazine, we published the definitive history of 1 VEV and 2 VEV. It was a superb piece of work by Doug Nye. Writing about it now we can give a progress report on 1 VEV and, surprisingly enough, there’s plenty of new information, not the least of it being our driving impressions after pushing it hard round Castle Combe circuit.
If this car looks great, it goes even better. Fresh from its absolutely perfect, wonderfully sympathetic rebuild, it’s as good as new, if not better. We’ll get to that but, first, let’s take to the track. The car is waiting, in sunshine in the paddock, all ready to go, and the new owner, Adrian Beecroft, has invited us to take him round as fast as we like. Call him mad if you like, but we go back a few years and he trusts me for some reason.
There are no belts but the old bucket seats are comfortable, the engine starts instantly with a fabulous, deep, eager roar and we trickle away in first towards the circuit. Apart from the steering, which is heavy, it’s as easy to potter around as a Morris Minor. Even the clutch is fairly effortless to manage and there’s nothing harsh about 1 VEV. Out on the circuit, however, the performance is utterly stunning.
On our second lap we came up behind a gorgeous new Aston Martin; it was being driven well so I can’t imagine what that bloke thought when we appeared alongside, coming out of the tight righthander at Quarry, and released 1 VEV with full throttle in second gear. It took off with a trace of opposite lock and wheelspin. There was just no contest. We had gone. On the longer straights, it fairly leaps ahead and the acceleration above 120mph is still very strong.
It’s set up for the road at present, so the damping is a bit soft, calling for care in the fastest bends. It could get out of hand quite easily at speed but, aimed accurately, it is very stable, it likes a bit of sideways style and I was surprised at how well the Vredestein tires held on. The brakes were suffering from mild pad knock-off, needing an occasional bit of left-foot encouragement on the straights, but that’s normal enough with new brakes and it’s easily corrected. Even if the 250GTOs did beat this beautiful Aston on the circuits, I think 1 VEV would win hands down for road-driving pleasure. As Ian Moss said, this Aston Martin was basically a road car.
Back in 1962, Autocar magazine was allowed to road test a new DB4GT Zagato, an extraordinary privilege when you think that only 19 were made and the price new was £5470. Admittedly, an equivalent Ferrari cost even more then, but the price of a contemporary Jaguar E-type – just over two grand – puts it into perspective. Several final drive ratios were available, that test car being fitted with a middle-of-the-range 3.31:1 cwp giving a rev-limited top speed of 153mph at 6050rpm on Dunlop R5 tires – they gave 25.3mph per 1000rpm in top. The Autocar testers, renowned for their accuracy, recorded 0-60mph in 6.1 seconds and went on to a remarkable 0-140mph in 32.2 seconds.
Today 1 VEV is quicker than that. Its power is well above the 314bhp claimed in 1961 and the torque figure is now 348lb ft. With its Vredestein tires and 3.06:1 final drive it does 27.3mph/1000rpm and that equates to 165mph at the same 6050rpm. It would pull that easily. Richard says that with the right back axle it would do 180mph and I’m sure he’s right. Matched against modern machinery, only the most outrageous supercars would see it off.
If this story serves to remind us of anything, it is this: owners of such fantastic cars usually tend to treat them appropriately. But in the late 1960s 1 VEV was nothing more than a used car with very little value. As a former race car, apparently of no great distinction then, it surely made an unusual road car with exceptional looks and performance, but no doubt it threatened to drop further in value while costing its owners a small fortune to run.
For those who could afford it, 1 VEV provided entertaining motoring for a series of owners, one family using it simply as a roadgoing hack for years. Perhaps that radio was fitted around that time. All of its owners appreciated what it represented, all the way down the line, but it wasn’t taken as seriously as it is today.
Nobody guessed then that it might appreciate in value. When speaking to Roy Salvadori he told me that during the 1960s he had an Aston Martin DBR1 which he advertised in the right magazines for a year before anybody was prepared to buy it. He was relieved to get £1100 for it in the end. Today, 40 years on, if the whispers we hear are true, a DBR1 is worth about 9000 times that much – and 1 VEV is coming up fast.
Back in 1990, 1 VEV had just been restored and William Loughran paid £1.54m for it at auction. He soon sold it on for a small profit. A few months later, as the market collapsed all round the world, 2 VEV was auctioned in Monaco but was withdrawn when the bidding failed to reach £850,000. A year or two later, Loughran bought 1 VEV back and he owned it for 15 years before selling it to Adrian earlier this year.
‘They are beautiful,’ says Loughran. ‘I’ve had five or six of them, and a few years ago I had one that had been rebuilt by RS Williams. When the weather was nice after work, I used to take 1 VEV home, just for the pleasure of driving it. It had seemed great until I drove the car restored by RS Williams and realised that by comparison 1 VEV drove like a bag of spanners. I joined the queue and in due course it went to RS Williams for the full works.’
Although 1 VEV had been restored previously, that was 17 years ago and time had taken its toll. Also, restoration standards were then not as high as they are today. A strong point in the car’s favour was that it still had all its principal original parts, including the engine, gearbox and back axle.
Once Richard Williams had taken the car in and stripped it down, however, it was clearly in dire need of a full cosmetic and mechanical rebuild. The mechanical side of the job was quite straightforward, but the body was rather more tricky. Not only had it been poorly repaired in the past, meaning that there was a great amount of filler under the paint, but somewhere way back in time it had also lost the correct shape of its rear wings.
It took some time to get that right. Ian Moss was called in as a consultant and William Loughran also inspected the car at crucial stages of the body builder’s work. With the aid of photographs, plus Zagato’s own original drawings and dimensions, this aspect of the restoration was given the most painstaking attention. As all the DB4GT Zagatos were handbuilt, every one is a little different but finally 1 VEV’s correct original shape was brought back into being to the satisfaction of all concerned.
The brief was to restore it as it was in 1961, not as a modern historic race car, even though some concessions were made to later engineering know-how. That’s why it has the original low-backed racing bucket seats, no seat belts and no rollcage. Although Adrian races other cars, the fact is that 1 VEV carries an unusual responsibility because is such a stunningly original car. What it’s really worth now is a private matter, but there’s no doubt that it amounts to several millions. More to the point, Adrian is acutely aware that it has never suffered anything approaching a serious shunt. Mainly for that reason, he aims to use 1 VEV only for more gentle events, such as the regularity class in the French Tour Auto. It should be ideal. » Thanks to the St James’s Place Wealth Management Group for inviting us to Castle Combe during their track day for existing and potential clients. Two senior partners of St James’s Place were kind enough to allow us to test 1 VEV during the day.

‘thrilled by the fantastic driving of Dick Jacobs in his maroon, 1¼-liter MG saloon’.
Time and again Jacobs would draw level with Marshall and Bennett in their 1½-liter Javelins and cheekily pass them at Stowe, only to be overhauled on the long drag up Abbey Curve. However, Jacobs refused to give up and, to the great delight of the spectators, gradually outstripped those two Javelins and set off after the class leader, another Javelin driven by Bert Hadley. When Hadley’s engine expired in a cloud of smoke, Jacobs swept through to take the class victory.
Serious touring car racing began on that day, and that’s what this story is all about. It might have been an amusing sideshow to motor racing’s purists, but it was an important business to the participants. Jacobs was there to sell MGs from his dealership, Mill Garage in Chigwell Road, London E18. For Jaguar, the Silverstone races were a golden opportunity to demonstrate the crushing superiority of the magnificent, elegant MkVII saloon, which emerged head-and-shoulders above all rivals.
As the Production Touring-Cars had proved so popular, the BRDC kept them in the Silverstone programmes of 1953 and 1954, with Jaguar MkVIIs the outright victors every time, and Jacobs also winning his class with the same MG on all three occasions. Our archive photograph, from the 1954 race, appeared in Dick Jacobs’ autobiography An MG Experience. The caption, ‘Class winner Dick Jacobs lapped by Stirling Moss, car no 3’ is, however, incorrect. Ian Appleyard won that race in car number 3 and the picture shows him lapping Jacobs at Copse Corner, Silverstone. The fast Jaguars lapped the MG twice that day. Following closely behind are the two MkVIIs of Tony Rolt (5) and Stirling Moss (4), the latter playing ‘catchup’ after the starter motor apparently jammed at the Le Mans-style start.
Apart from a change in colour, the MG has survived intact. It is owned today by Marc Hanson, who contacted us to say that the ex-works MkVII of Tony Rolt is another remarkable survivor, and owned now by a great Jaguar enthusiast, Peter Burton. Marc wondered whether we would like to reunite the cars, some six decades after that significant race.
We did exactly that. Life is somewhat less relaxed these days, however, especially at Silverstone, but Stuart Pringle and his staff at the BRDC took the trouble to accommodate us free of charge so that we could try the cars on the Grand Prix circuit and capture an image of them together again at Copse Corner – which happens to be the one part of the circuit that hasn’t changed since 1954. The BRDC is conscious of the history of the club and of the circuit, and we are very grateful to all concerned.
Out on the circuit, it was obvious that both these cars are extremely well maintained and almost unbelievably original – they’re just as they must have been when Jacobs and Rolt raced them all those years ago. On my first lap in the MG, it dawned on me that the introduction of production car racing in the 1950s was of extreme significance, bringing about a host of rapid improvements in everyday family saloons.
It’s easy enough to produce a list of all the faults in these cars but that’s hardly the point, except that it’s interesting to appreciate just what the drivers had to overcome when racing them back then. The MG YB was still essentially a pre-war design, a perfectly charming small sporty saloon, with its ‘suicide’ doors and heavy construction, but distinctly out of date even in 1952. It feels very slow today despite its ‘Stage 2’ tuning, which lifted the power and speed considerably from the 46bhp and 71mph of the standard model. It has MG TD-type twin carburettors, plus bigger valves and heavier valve springs and is as it raced at Silverstone in 1953.
In 1952, the cars were meant to be standard showroom models but that Stage 2 tuning was permitted in 1953. When the rules were further relaxed for 1954, Jacobs went for a pretty wild engine specification that he claimed gave him 100mph. As that made the car almost impossible to drive in normal traffic, Marc has opted wisely for the 1953 specification.
The MG feels quite stiffly sprung and poorly damped but it handles safely and predictably, despite occasional yet harmless little skips on the limit through a fast corner. There’s no denying that the outside front suspension plunges rather uselessly as you turn-in and the body rolls a lot in heavy cornering. A shift of direction when negotiating an ess-bend exposes the lethargic response of the antique chassis design.
That’s the plain truth but it’s still great fun to drive this immensely important early racing saloon, and it is a wonderful thing that it has survived. We have to respect Dick Jacobs’ achievements, understanding what he was up against in those early days.
Approaching Peter’s Jaguar in exactly the same spirit, we can note the excessive body roll in hard cornering and there’s no doubt that the Jaguar drivers had to manage the rather weak drum brakes when racing these cars. Jaguar, of course, was already pioneering disc brakes but the saloons were still on drums. The MkVII is much bigger and heavier than the little MG and it is also immensely faster. Through the many direction changes at the very fast Becketts section of Silverstone, the old Jaguar turned out to be much more responsive than I expected; yes, it does roll a lot but it’s not a wallowing great barge. It can be wound up and almost tricked into flicking through those bends quickly, and with surprisingly little steering movement. It was, in short, a hell of a good car in its day and Moss, Rolt and Appleyard must have felt like kings of the GP circuit back in 1954. All three shared the outright fastest lap at 2min 16sec, an average of 77.48mph.
The BRDC had put production car racing on the agenda at Silverstone very effectively but it was the Brands Hatch-based British Racing & Sports Car Club (BRSCC) that took it a stage further. Led by enterprising BRSCC Club Secretary Ken Gregory, Brands Hatch was expanding fast. The Kentish circuit had been extended in 1953 with the addition of Druids Hill Bend and plans to create a Grand Prix circuit were already in place by then. Gregory and his fellow directors were looking for ways to increase spectator attendance at Brands Hatch and the other circuits at which they had started to run meetings. Production touring cars, or saloons as they called them, fitted the bill perfectly.
If I could go back in time and see just one saloon car race of the past, it would be the BRSCC’s International ‘Sporting Life’ Trophy for Production Saloon Cars at Oulton Park on 27 August 1955. This long-forgotten event seems perfectly astonishing now. There was one foreign entrant, Swedish driver Jo Bonnier in a very fast Alfa Romeo 1900, and he won the 15-lap race by 12.4sec from Ken Wharton’s Austin A90 Westminster.
Incredibly, third place overall went to Tony Brooks, then on the brink of GP stardom but on this occasion driving a DKW to victory in the up-to- 1100cc class. Brooks even beat the supposedly faster MG Magnette, entered by Dick Jacobs and driven by Alan Foster to victory in the next class up. It gets better. Believe it or not, Stirling Moss was driving a works Standard Ten in the up-to-1100cc class. Moss had, as ever, got away first at the Le Mans-style start and, although he was overtaken immediately by the faster cars to end up second in class, his conduct of the Standard was described as ‘amazing’.
That was not all. While Bonnier cruised serenely ahead, Ken Wharton had a Longbridge-Dagenham fight of mammoth proportions on his hands. His Austin was swapping second place like mad with the Ford Zephyr entered by Raymond Mays. The Ford’s driver was a certain Mike Hawthorn, standing in for Peter Collins at the last minute. Unfortunately, the Mays-prepared Zephyr’s engine blew up but what a race that was. Reporter Cyril Posthumus called it ‘a striking demonstration of the capabilities of the modern production saloon car, and excellent entertainment throughout.’
Production car racing had really arrived and Ken Gregory went on to introduce the first BRSCC British Saloon Car Championship in 1958. There were four classes based on engine capacity, modifications were strictly limited and it was a great success. Despite fanciful suggestions about competitors being able to race the family car and also use it for shopping during the week, saloon car racing was already a serious business and manufacturers were quick to become involved.
Marc Hanson’s MG YB and Peter Burton’s Jaguar MkVII must be the oldest survivors from the earliest British saloon car races, making them highly prized collectors’ items. It helps that the histories of both cars are known. Dick Jacobs acquired his YB direct from the MG works at Abingdon, specifically for the 1952 Silverstone race. He sold it in late 1954 and it had a series of owners who hardly used it. A basic restoration was carried out in the 1970s, when it was repainted two-tone green but otherwise left essentially undisturbed.
After following the car for some time, Marc put in a successful bid at the Silverstone Classic sale in 2009. He had the engine rebuilt by MG specialist Peter Edney, had the suspension restored to as-new condition, and now uses the car in numerous suitable events such as the Brighton Speed Trials, Jersey International Motoring Festival and sprints at Goodwood and other venues. He has collected a few trophies and, as he says, it’s the first time the car has won anything for nearly 60 years.
The full history of Peter Burton’s imposing Jaguar is even better known. In 1954 it was the company car of Arthur Whittaker, director and general manager of Jaguar Cars Ltd, who had been working with William Lyons since joining the Swallow Sidecar Company in 1924, aged 20. The Jaguar boss was knighted in 1956 but he was still plain Mr Lyons in 1954. Even so, it’s easy to imagine him announcing sharply: ‘Whittaker, we’re taking your car for Major Rolt to drive in the Production Car Race at Silverstone.’ It was driven into the competitions department and specially prepared with C-type engine parts and a modified, close-ratio gearbox. The suspension was stiffened and the rear spats altered. After the race it was sold but has been preserved safely ever since. As a committed Jaguar enthusiast, Peter Burton acquired ‘LHP 5’ recently. He uses it on the Mille Miglia re-run and hopes to race it at a future Goodwood Revival.
As the sole surviving ex-works MkVII to have competed in a major race when new, Peter’s Jaguar joins Marc’s MG in a place of special honour in the history of British Touring Car racing – but we can still call them saloons if we prefer.

This is
only a brief overview of certain important events in the
history of the Hummer. The Hummer was released for public
sale in 1999.
General Motors (GM) bought the Hummer brand name from
AM General in 1999.
The Hummer is essentially a replacement for the HMMWV
military vehicle. In 2004 the Hummer is taken International
for overseas consumption.
In 2006 only the Hummer H2 and H3 were still being made
as General Motors decided to cease production.

"The Family That Slays Together..., pt. 1/Gemberling's Requiem/Spagett" S2008
- B+ Community Grade
So here we are–part one of the two part climax that ends the third season of Venture Bros. Feels a little weird, doesn't it? We only started a few months ago; seems too soon to be saying goodbye.
Which, really, is my biggest criticism for this season as a whole. Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer are clearly in love with the world they've created, and as viewers, we benefit form the care and attention they put into the small details; making sure each character has a back story, connecting those back stories in often surprising ways, and, of course, the references to off-hand remarks in earlier episodes that's been a show hallmark from the very beginning. There's craft at work here, basically, and nerds at play.
That's not an inherently bad thing. But as we run headlong into the finale, there are a few niggling doubts that stay with me. While all the meticulous attention rewards close viewing, it also means that there's precious little time to stop and relax. There have been some brilliantly funny bits in this batch of episodes, but you can't help wishing the writers would let a few chunks of mythology pass by the wayside in order to give us more time to simply enjoy the characters and their interactions. It's an easy enough problem to overlook when there are still more shows left in the season, but knowing now that time is nearly up, I find myself wondering about all those disparate threads, and how so many moments of potential were left hanging just so we could move on to something shiny and new.
For instance, remember Rusty's apparent change of heart back in "The Doctor Is Sin"? Maybe "change of heart" is stretching the point, but there was a clear indication of a character shift, that maybe, just maybe, he might grow up a little. There's a nod to this in "ORB," but that's about it Every other appearance he's had, he's been just as grasping and selfish as ever, and given the way part one of "The Family That Slays Together Stays Together" plays out, he doesn't seem to be changing any time soon.
That's not to say "Family" isn't bitchin'. Turns out the death car ("Adrian") attack last week wasn't a fluke. Brock gets the bad news from Molotov Cocktease that OSI has issued termination orders, and they've hired three crack assassins to do the deed: Herr Trigger, a German psychopath who really loves his work, Go Fish, specializing in sea-based kills (and there's always a canal, or an inlet, or a fjord), and the too-cool for a codename Le Tueur, who collects Silver Age comics and has an elephant chestpiece. Brock determines the best thing to do is to get the Ventures to Spider Skull Island to keep them safe and give him elbow room to protect himself. But since Dean, Hank, and Rusty all have the survival instincts of a horny Crystal Lake pothead, things probably aren't going to work out as planned.
"Family" has some terrific action sequences, with Brock having to kick three asses in a row in a variety of gruesome and/or comic ways. Not all the jokes land–Herr Trigger's fetishism got old quick, as did the second trip in as many weeks to Hunter Gathers' strip club–but the ultra-violence was great. Having Brock back in fighting form is always a good thing, and the way he interacts with Hank and Dean throughout "Family" was sweet without ever getting overly sentimental. (The whole "I don't love you, boys!" moment works because it wasn't overplayed; in most shows, there'd be a beat with Brock looking all sad after the jet left, but that didn't happen here because it simply isn't necessary.)
Plus, some of the jokes were great. The subplot with the Monarch finally making an assault on the Venture compound, only to find the whole place deserted apart from a distraught (and half-naked) Sgt. Hatred, had the Moppets in their usual form (pity their stuffed animals), and Monarch, as always, struggling in vain against the incompetencies of his staff and reality itself. And for once, it was nice to get to the end, think, "Oh man, there's no way they can tie all this together" and actually be right.
Still, my problem with this season isn't that Rusty's spiritual awakening (or whatever) got shortchanged, it's that in giving over so much time to mythology and plot, some of the connection between the audience and the Venture family was lost. With some shows, a thirteen episode season would be a blessing, but here, I wish we could have a few more shows; because there's a potential here, that potential I first mentioned way back at the premiere, for Venture Bros to be something more than just an extended series of in-jokes and dark parody. There's a depth to the cast that the creators haven't completely engaged with yet. It's a good show that could be a great one; it just needs that one last push.
Who knows? There's always part 2. Maybe we'll get some orb-time, and maybe Rusty'll be less of a dick. We'll just have to wait and see.
Looks like Fat Guy Stuck In Internet is bidding us farewell, at least for now. That'd make a perfect segue into some sort of "Please god, may it be forever!" type comment, but I'll give 'em this much: the show went out on a high note. "Gemberling's Requiem" has the closest thing to visual excitement that the series has yet produced, and it even flirts (in a few brief moments) with actual pathos. It's quickly undermined pathos, and the episode's ending is as much a buzzkill as anything else the show's done, but for a couple minutes, I actually found myself engaged.
Gemberling and Chains have finally (after a journey in which no actual progression was ever indicated) made it to the CEO's Dark Tower fortress. After passing through the Field of Delights–Gemberling and Chains' buffalo chicken induced dreaming, with the fat guy longing for home and the bounty hunter finally finding a cure for "ass cancer," was a hoot–Gemberling confronts the Big Bad on his home turf. The CEO sends the evil Byte to do his dirty work, and the fight here isn't half bad, ending in a not-entirely-lame Fellowship of the Ring nod. The climactic battle between Gemberling and the CEO is pretty good too, with lots of swooping camera angles and even some tension, a definite rarity for the show. And the climax to the climax, with the candle gag that opened the ep finally getting a pay-off, wasn't too shabby either.
But then it gets all dumb again, cutting through the weak suspense with a Back To The Future nod that's not all that amusing. I dunno. My prejudices as a reviewer have always been a problem for me when it comes to Fat Guy, since I'll always be pulling for story to take precedence if one ever shows itself; but given the fairly successful attempts to be funny and halfway-plotted in the minutes leading up to that final, limp punchline, I don't feel like I'm entirely to blame for getting annoyed.
Outside from the nominal framing sketches that follow the two title characters each episode, Tim & Eric Awesome Show Great Job! isn't about "plot" at all, and more power to it. While I wasn't a huge fan of the rascal-based sketching of, um, "Rascal" last week, "Spagett" managed to hit some traditional beats without settling into a rut. Calling back to an earlier sketch about a freakish balding man with a penchant for pasta and spooking people, the ep finds Tim in high spirits; as he tells Eric, Steven Spielberg wants to make a Spagett movie, which is the first step to fame, fortune, humiliation of your best friend, etc. There's even a pre-made poster: Spagett and the Golden Treasure. (Tag-line: "Spagett about it.") Things get more embarrassing when Eric visits Tim on set, disrupting the shoot and getting the cold shoulder from Brian Posehn (actually Brian Posehn) and Spielberg himself (not actually Steven Spielberg). There's some karmic justice when the movie tanks, and Tim undergoes plastic surgery to make himself look like Spagett permanently without knowing the franchise is doomed; but the kids still love him, and Eric is still the guy on the sidelines who gets photoshopped into a fern.
In between all this, we get a brief moment with Steve Brule ("Take your sister to the prom!"), an ad from Steve Schirripa for a product that makes eggs grow in your large intestine, a quick bit with Video Match ("When I lend you a diaper, make sure you return it"), and a biology class on the nature of penises that leads to the music video, "I Got Chubs For You."
"Spagett" felt pretty solid to me. While the green-screen jokes in the main sketches were a little old, the outfit Tim wore made it work; and just the fact that Spagett is a hideous, hideous frigging thing gave the Hollywood-doesn't-get-it stuff more of an edge. And all the other bits were fine too–the eggs ad started off as standard (and gross) Mr. Show style comedy, but the brief flurry of edits near the end changed the tone, and the "Chubs" video was just all kinds of wrong.
Tim & Eric is the kind of show you enjoy without ever being able to tell anyone else you like it; the more indefensible it becomes, the more it sticks with you. This one was only about a 7 on the Off-Putting Meter, but while there was nothing like the "Not Jackie Chan" boardgame buzzer moment (the chicken-hatching bit came close, due largely to the grainy video), there wasn't anything as dull as "Swingtown." All hail the middle of the road. (Or, in this case, that part near the side where all the dead squirrels end up.)

Stray Observations:
--There's an extra two minute scene with the Monarch and crew if you watch "Family" at Adult Swim.com. It doesn't add much to the plot, but it's funny.
--Loved Brock's howls of pain after dismantling his car. Also, H.E.L.P.E.R.'s response.
--Hank's really coming into his own this season, isn't he?
--I caught James Urbaniak (voice of Doctor Venture and others) on an old Law & Order: Criminal Intent. It's very weird hearing Rusty's voice come out of a non-cartoon.

Cake Pops & Donuts
Do you know what this is?
Just a couple doughnut pans that Bed Bath & Beyond has
I have been wanting a doughnut pan for ages and finally picked one up last night.
I got the regular size (yellow) which is still not going to make “huge” doughnuts. I didn’t need the mini size because I personally don’t have the patience to fill up all those little holes and be all neat and tidy about it.
Plus, I got something else…
I have been coveting the Babycakes products for years and decided to go for it.
I got both a Donut Maker and a Cake Pop Maker
They were each $19.99 at BB& Bb ut I had $5 off coupons for both, so each item cost me a whopping $14.99 I can handle that.
That’s why I thrift shop for dishes. And it sounds like many of you do, too. Thanks for the info about the Corningware dish from my last post in the comments. A 70s favorite is seems.
I also hoard BB & B coupons because they never expire.
So now I can get busy Donut making
and Cake Pop Making
I didn’t buy a Whoopie Pie Pan but I was tempted.
I think I have plenty of new toys to play with but how fun do Whoopie Pies sound?
I don’t have any donuts or cake pops or whoopie pies around right now, but I do have these
and these Peanut Butter Oatmeal White Chocolate Cookies to tide me over til I can make some donuts and donut holes, i.e. cake pops
Questions:
1. Donut or Doughnut?
My fingers type Donut easier than they do Doughnut.
Donut is usually preceded by the word Mini. Mini donuts remind me of everything good and right from my childhood.
So I vote Donut.
2. Have you ever made donuts? If so, please share your fave recipe. Same with Cake Pops, i.e. donut holes. Recipes please.
There are so many recipes and it seems that donuts are the next really hot foodie trend and everywhere I turn, I find more recipes. Overwhelming!
I want moist, rich, not super cakey, and not dry donuts.
Flavor? I am open. From vanilla to chocolate to pumpkin spice.
And anything goes with glazes and frosting, too. Countless combinations.
I love personal stamps of approval so hopefully you’ve tried and made some winners.
3. Do you have a donut pan, a donut maker, or a cake pop maker?
If you don’t have a donut pan, for about 7 bucks you can get one.
And for 14.99 with a coupon at BB & B, you can snag the other Babycakes items.
And in the meantime, I have read that most donut recipes will work just fine in muffin tins.
Or you can pipe a donut shape onto a cookie sheet from a corner that’s been cut off from a Ziplock baggie filled with batter.
Thanks for the KeVita Drinks Giveaway entries
OMG, I love that vintage Corningware!! We had that set when I was growing up. I hated it then but want it now! haha Checking out that vintage web site… awesome, thanks! :D

I bought a cake pop maker too! I know they aren’t REAL cake pops, but still, cake balls! Super cool. :)

Let me know if you come across any recipes that work well for you in your cakepop maker. I’m all ears!

I’ve been wanting one of those donut pans for MONTHS! I’m buying one this weekend, cannot wait :) Fall weather screams donuts to me, so it’s necessary now more than ever ;)
Reply
I follow Bakerella’s cake pop recipe because they are the moistest, and although they are more work than using a cake pop maker – they are well worth it.
I have never seen any of those pans before (or the cupcake or donut maker).
Reply
oh ya you got one!!! you will love it
we need to get the cake pop pan, we never made any yet
Reply
hi averie, i haven’t commented in a long time, but i have been reading….
a donut pan has been on my list for a long time…just wondering, if i got the machine, does it make nicer, rounded edges on both sides of the donut?…i was thinking this might be the only reason not to get the baking pan……any thoughts??
Reply
Averie @ Love Veggies & Yoga replied: — November 10th, 2011 at 11:45 am
I got both the pan and the maker b/c they were both cheap….8 bucks and 14.99 with my coupons. I have been using the actual donut pan more, just b/c cleanup is easy and i can make recipes to share w/ readers with the donut pan b/c more people have pans than the makers. But both of them make smooth, round donuts.
Reply
just got the whoopie maker….. yeah….. i love it soooo much. i got the babycakes one and it made mini whoopie pies, yum….. unfortunately i ate 4 of them::))
Reply
Averie @ Love Veggies & Yoga replied: — November 16th, 2011 at 7:13 pm
What recipes are you using for them? The recipes for donut-maker donuts are different than donut pan in the oven donuts…or in your case whoopies pies. I didn’t buy their cookbook…
Reply
You do not have to buy a whoopie pie pan. Donut pans and cake bite pans make sense, but just follow this recipe and they form themselves. I made them for a cake walk at work last week and they were being fought over. :)
Reply
I never would have thought to look at BB&B for these things! Wow!

so cheap. like 8 bucks. just buy it :)

Darren Bent has backed Gabby Agbonlahor to return to his "explosive" best next term.
Bent admits he cannot wait to reignite his strike partnership with Agbonlahor having been out of action since February.
The pair both endured difficult seasons in 2011-12 but showed glimpses of their potential as a deadly duo in the early part of the campaign.
And Bent even believes they can flourish together on the international stage as well as for Villa.
"I'd like to think me and Gabby could be picked for the same England squad again," said Bent.
"If he can keep himself fit and look after his hamstrings there's every chance.
"But when you've got that much pace and explosiveness you're always going to have problems with your hamstrings.
"If he can get over that then there's no reason why he can't force himself into the squad. At the start of last season his performances were fantastic.
"I know he maybe didn't get the goals that he would have liked in the second half of the season, but it's hard when you have injuries here and there.
"We all know what he is capable of and with a good run I'm sure he can show that for Villa and England."
Bent has tipped Agbonlahor to make a return to the England fold if he can reproduce his early season form from last term.
"Hopefully if he can bring back that form he was showing at the start of last season, he can get back in," he added.
"It would be great for us to play together for England as well as Villa because when he gets going his pace can cause real problems for defenders."

I’m back, I’m finally back from California. I’ve spent the last two nights working until midnight. I really should be at work this weekend but my brain is done. So I’m resting and focusing on birds. I took some fantastic shots of Cedar Waxwings in Heber a few weeks ago.
You should zoom in on that picture. It’s amazing to see how silky his feathers are. They have the hair-like edges but they stay so smooth they don’t look like feathers from far away. They’re called waxwings because the tips of the feathers look like the wicks of candles, but all of their feathers look like smooth wax to me.
what do you want?
The nice thing about this lens is it’s like seeing birds for the first time. They have more details than you see in most pictures. As soon as I get some better shots I want to show you what the Chestnut-backed Chickadees from California look like compared to Black-capped Chickadees in Utah.
Waxwings are known for being very social with each other. I guess they’re social with other birds too because I saw a group of them in a tree with a Western Kingbird. The kingbird is on the bottom right.
You can see waxwings year round in Utah, but summer is the best time to see them consistently. For the third year in a row I’ve found them at the same tree because it has berries and waxwings love berries. Montanagirl has amazing pictures of the birds eating berries. Jon is going to plant a cherry tree for me in the backyard. Maybe he should plant a berry tree for the waxwings too.
It’s always nice to be home! The detail in these pictures with your new lens is amazing. They’re definitely very sleek looking birds.
Thanks! I’m really happy with the lens.
You’re going to have a lot of fun with your new lens, and we’ll enjoy seeing the excellent bird photos!
Thanks!
Beautiful. Love the red tips.
They’re such lovely birds.

Colombia Doesn't Need a Free-trade Agreement to Get Rid of its Self-destructive TariffsBy David Holcberg (International Herald Tribune, April 19, 2008)
Colombia doesn't need a free-trade agreement with the United States to get rid of its self-destructive tariffs on products imported from America.
It is in the self-interest of Colombians, as it is in the self-interest of any people, for their government to eliminate all tariffs on imported products.
Such tariffs raise the price of imported products and rob buyers of the savings they would have pocketed if trade were free.
Moreover, governments have no moral right to force their citizens to pay tariffs for foreign products they want to buy. Any government that respects the rights of its citizens and is concerned about their welfare should eliminate its tariffs unilaterally, regardless of what other governments do.
The United States, as the leading capitalist country in the world, should phase out all of its protectionist policies and its tariffs on foreign products. The economic benefits to Americans would be incalculable, as tens of millions of producers and consumers would benefit directly from the savings that would accrue from the freedom to buy cheaper goods. In addition, such a principled stand on free trade might serve as an example to other nations, who could choose to be smart enough to follow America's lead or dumb enough to stay crippled by retaining their own protectionist.

Boedker's off-season goal to get meaner.
Coyotes forward Mikkel Boedker jumps into the boards after scoring against the Kings 3/12/13..
."
Doan doesn't regret decision to stay with Coyotes.
Coach Dave Tippett's contract is set to expire, as is General Manger Don Maloney's.
Goalie Mike Smith and center Boyd Gordon headline the team's class of pending unrestricted free agents.," he said. "Not at all. Not once have I ever thought that. The group of guys in here is the reason why. Obviously I'm a huge fan of the city, the Valley. The organization has been great to me. But the group of guys that are in this room, that's why you choose to stay and you stay.".
"I think it was disappointing when it never worked out," Doan said. "It didn't get done when we thought it was. I think because everyone kind of got pretty excited about the fact that it was going to get done and it didn't made it a little tougher. But we've dealt with it in the past, and it's amazing the way the guys have handled it and unfortunately we didn't handle it as well this year."
The ownership instability didn't prevent the Coyotes from re-signing Doan, but it could very well sever the team's relationship with Smith. Negotiations between Smith's camp and the Coyotes have been hampered by the uncertainty as Smith wants to know where he'll be playing long-term.
"I think it affects the group more in the fact of players you want to sign," Tippett said. "Maybe they're here that you want to sign longer-term, and you can't get signed so they're wondering where their future is.
"The unique situation with Shane, there's not many players in sports right now that would take that leap of faith right now. That was a very unique situation. But you have lots of other players on our team that in a normal situation on a normal team that's owned, they would probably be signed."
Since Jamison's bid fizzled, other suitors have emerged. The favorite is Renaissance Sports & Entertainment. That group was supposed to meet with Glendale officials and league representatives Tuesday, but the meeting was cancelled. News of when the parties might reschedule the get-together hasn't surfaced, and perhaps that's by design.
"Since Greg Jamison's bid in January didn't come to fruition, it's been very quiet and that's on purpose," Maloney said. "The NHL has purposely gone 180 degrees the other direction in the sense that there are no stories out there with that's happening behind-the-scenes. But rest assured, they've been working diligently trying to get an ownership in place that will have long-term success and that's what we want.
"Great organizations start from the top down. We all know it. We've been relatively successful on the ice, but you can replay the tape last year and the year before and the year before. We have to have it settled. The positive thing I think for Arizona hockey fans is it will be settled. We still remain hopeful it will work out here. I'm encouraged by the things that I know, but I'm an optimistic person by nature, too.
"I think from an organization, we're in a great place to continue to push this group forward and build this franchise. But we have to have something come to some sort of resolution on ownership, and we're optimistic that means playing here in Glendale in a great building in front of terrific fans."
For years, Doan has matched that optimism -- if not verbally than definitely with his actions. But living in limbo is trying. And guessing when this will finally end isn't fun, either.
"I'm not even convinced," Doan said when asked if he agrees a resolution will be reached this summer. "I'd love for it to be over, and obviously I'd love it to be here. I've made that more than clear, but hopefully it is over and hopefully it is here. And again, I didn't think there'd be any chance it could go for four years but it has."
Daly gives Coyotes ownership update
NHL Deputy Commissioner was a guest on Sportsnet's HOCKEY CENTRAL at Noon on Monday in advance of the league's draft lottery, and the conversation turned to the league-owned Coyotes. Asked if the process is any closer, Daly said, "Yes. "It’s still a work in progress," Daly told the panel. "There’s still a lot of work to be done, but it’s still something that we're diligent about trying to complete." Daly confirmed the purchase price would be more than $150 million but said, "there are no guarantees" the team will remain in Phoenix. He mentioned the City of Glendale as a "big question mark. "There's no doubt we’re dealing with Mr. Gosbee and Mr. LeBlanc and trying to work through and get to a deal with them," Daly said. "But there are other interested people that we’re working with at the same time, as well. Nobody has exclusivity here. But obviously we’re getting close to having to make some decisions and sign some documentation, and we’ve got to work on it. I was on a conference call again last night. It’s something we’re working on." Canadian financier George Gosbee has teamed with Canadian venture capitalist Anthony LeBlanc to assemble an investment group to purchase the team. Darin Pastor, the founder and CEO of wealth management firm Capstone Affluent Strategies of Irvine, Calif., has also expressed interest. And even though his bid to buy the Coyotes fell through in January, Greg Jamison said he was still continuing his efforts. The Coyotes missed the playoffs this season after three consecutive berths. An early off-season should be a busy one. General Manager Don Maloney's contract is set to expire, as is coach Dave Tippett's. Aside from dealing with contracts on the hockey operations side of the ledger, goalie Mike Smith and center Boyd Gordon headline the team's class of unrestricted free agents. Forwards Mikkel Boedker and Lauri Korpikoski and defenseman Michael Stone are restricted free agents. "We came very close to selling this team a couple times, and some unforeseen circumstances kept it from happening," Daly said. "That's why I’m the first person who can’t give any guarantees on any result here. At some point in time, you beat your head against the wall enough times you have to try a different hole."
Coyotes missed practice time during lockout-shortened season
At the conclusion of every season, Coyotes coach Dave Tippett spends a portion of the summer dissecting, analyzing and logging the statistics and trends from the previous campaign. It's likely Tippett does this later in the off-season as he will be part of Team Canada's coaching staff at the World Championships this spring, Hockey Canada announced Saturday. But when he does sit down to digest the season that was, categorizing the impact the lockout had on the season will undoubtedly be part of his research -- even though he hopes that's a situation that never happens again. "It’d be interesting to see where everything falls out," Tippett said. "The one thing that seemed to me early the teams with high skill, the games were so sloppy early that the high skill teams that could capitalize on chances seemed to take advantage early. Chicago was a great example of that." Tippett might look at the performance of teams that had players competing overseas compared to teams that had most of their players stay at home. Or perhaps he'll study if teams that had players skate together during the lockout fared better than teams that had most of their players were scattered. But it seemed like once the season started, one of the most influential results of the lockout was the lack of practice time. "When there are times when your game is not in order or you have some injuries and you have players that need a full practice, but you got half your team is (too) tired to practice, those things have implications on what you’re doing," Tippett said. That seemed to particularly impact the Coyotes, who benefit from the repetition of practice to stay committed to their defensive style. "That being said, it’s like when there's bad ice in a game," Tippett said. "Everybody’s in the same boat. I don’t like to use excuses like that. That doesn’t work. You just find ways to overcome those things." The Coyotes tried, not falling out of playoff contention until the final week of the regular season. The rigorous travel induced by a compact, 48-game season also didn't help the Coyotes find extra time to hit the ice in between games. When the Coyotes close out the regular season tonight in Anaheim against the Ducks, they will complete their seventh back-to-back set of the season. "It’s not the norm," Tippett said. "That being said, everybody has to do it. There are some areas where your travel is tougher than others. The amount of miles that the Western teams fly is much greater than the Eastern teams. So it might have had more effect out here. "That being said, you always try to manage around those things. We tried to manager our players. We tried to err on the side of rest rather than practice a lot of nights. Talking to a lot of other coaches around the league, I think a lot of others were in that same boat. Rest, you always think to play your best you've got to be at 100 percent. That being said, there sure were times we wished we could have done a lot more practicing." In hindsight, though, Tippett wouldn't have added more practice time into the season. Frankly, it wasn't possible. "I don’t think you could have," he said. "When you come in everyday, you read your players. You can even read players as they’re getting off that plane at night and see where they are and see their energy levels. There were some times in the season where it was hard. You could tell the guys were dragging, and it’s not just physically. It’s mentally."
Game Day: Avalanche at Coyotes
- The Coyotes are 3-0-0 in the final regular-season home game under Tippett and have won seven of their last eight home finales.
- They're 22-17-10 in the first game of back-to-backs.
- The Coyotes have won nine of their last 11 home games against the Avalanche.
- The Coyotes are 19-for-19 on the penalty kill against the Avalanche over the past two seasons.
- The Avalanche are 1-6-1 in the first game of back-to-backs this season.
- J.S. Giguere's next appearance will tie him with Ken Wregget (575) for 45th place on the all-time list for games-played by a goalie.
D Michael Stone most improved among Coyotes
The Coyotes will hand out their annual team awards before Friday's home finale against the Colorado Avalanche.
The team doesn't recognize the most improved player but if it did, defenseman Michael Stone would seem the obvious choice for that honor.
Stone didn't crack the top six to start the season, shuffling between the Coyotes and the American Hockey League until he stuck around with the big club after a recall Feb.22. Since then, he's become a reliable option on the third pairing with a big shot from the right side.
The 22-year-old, taken 69th overall in 2008, made his Coyotes debut last season, playing in 13 games and two playoff games, but this season has been a turning point in his career.
Stone has played in 38 games, and his five goals rank second on the team among defensemen.
He scored his fifth Wednesday in a 2-1 win over the San Jose Sharks when he walked into a shot from the right faceoff circle.
"(Radim Vrbata) made a really good play to get me the puck," Stone said. "I had so much time I could have had a cup of coffee before I shot it. I’m glad it went in. I would have been pretty disappointed if it didn’t considering how much time I had. I just picked my spot and put it in."
A heavy shot has always been a strength of Stone's, and the Coyotes need that offense -- especially from the right side of their blue line. But the fact that he's releasing it more frequently is a sign of the confidence he's gained at the NHL level.
"I like to shoot the puck, as you can see," he said. "I’ve done it a lot in my career. It’s not something that I just started doing. Yeah, you build more confidence as things go on here."
For Stone to earn this much opportunity with the Coyotes, he's had to improve the play in his own end -- namely his physical presence. At 6-foot-3, the Coyotes want Stone to use his height to his advantage.
"I think being physical isn't just going out, running around, trying to hit people," he said. "It’s just being hard and firm in front of our net and taking guys' time and space away. It’s something I need to work on, finding guys that are loose, just you can even say having a good stick, stick on puck. I just need to continue to build on that."
Stone has done that so far in his time with the Coyotes this season, and that's why the coaching staff has been able to rely on him in crucial games and even dole out occasional power play time.
"He’s just got experience," coach Dave Tippett said. "He’s put his time in in the American (Hockey) League. He’s come to the NHL, and he’s had some ups and downs and he was back and forth between the minors early. But now you see a player when he comes up and he has the confidence to play in all situations, not just be out there but is confident out there, is willing to step up on a guy in the gap or is willing to be a little reckless and get away with it.
"That’s a player he’s confident enough to play in the league. He’s not scared to make a mistake. Like a lot of young players he's gone through that process and he’s come out of it very strong. I think he’s got a long career in this league."
Tippett compared Stone's style to that of a former defensive stalwart for the Coyotes.
"I think he’s similar to Adrian Aucoin," Tippett said. "Same kind of player, plays the same kind of role. You look at his junior years he was the captain of his team. Great leadership. He’ll continue to grow. He’s a very good player for us."
Stone's entry-level contract expires after this season, and he'll become a restricted free agent. But based on his growth this season, it seems like a no-brainer that he'll be back in the mix next season -- possibly starting in the top six this time.
"That's a goal for me," Stone said. "Whether that happens or not, that’s not really up to me. I just control what I can control. I think I just have to keep building and continue to be consistent."
Game Day: Sharks at Coyotes
- Winger Mikkel Boedker has a career-high five multi-point games this season.

Letdown in second period against Sharks unusual for Coyotes
A 24-7 shot advantage for the San Jose Sharks in the second period of Monday’s game led to a 3-0 deficit for the Coyotes.
That result after so much offensive pressure isn’t a surprise, but it was odd that the Coyotes let it happen during the second which had been one of their strongest periods recently.
In that 4-0 loss, the Coyotes had 12 shots in the first and limited the Sharks to 10 in a scoreless first period.
"We took our foot off the gas for whatever reason," winger Dave Moss said. "The first we had jump, and we’re hounding the puck. In the second they controlled the play, and we were never able to sustain any pressure."
In their previous four wins, the Coyotes scored nine goals and out-shot their opponents 58-38 in the second period.
- In a 3-1 win against the Los Angeles Kings (April 2), the Coyotes scored the go-ahead goal in that period.
- In a 4-2 win against the Detroit Red Wings (April 4), they scored three goals and out-shot the Wings 20-5.
- In a 4-0 win against the Colorado Avalanche (April 6), the Coyotes again scored three goals and had 18 shots compared to 10 from the Avalanche.
- In a 3-1 win against the Edmonton Oilers (April 10), they had two goals and 12 shots with the Oilers managing seven.
Game Day: Sharks at Coyotes
- The Coyotes rank fifth in the Western Conference for 5-on-5 goals-for/against radio at 1.07.
- They are ninth in the league with 30.4 shots per game.
- Winger Rob Klinkhammer and defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson are a team-high plus-7.
- Center Boyd Gordon has four goals and six points in his last nine games.
- Six Coyotes have played in all games so far this season including defenseman Keith Yandle, Ekman-Larsson, winger Mikkel Boedker and Vermette.
- Center Joe Thornton has 65 points in 60 career games against the Coyotes.

Many mothers who are stay-at-home parents lose their sense of self in the process of caretaking for their children. A woman`s natural instinct to “protect her flock” may come into direct conflict with developing a strong self-identity.

Question
Why is my 11month old refusing to eat?
My 11 month old frequently refuses to eat. At first he only refused when I was feeding him, so I let him feed himself, now he wont even touch the food I put in front of him, not even his favorites. I originally attributed this to teething, or just a phase (not letting me feed him), but now its going on 3 weeks and I'm starting worry about his nutritional intake. He snacks and takes formula throughout the day, but will not eat a meal. Any suggestions are appreciated

- My 11 month old son is doing the exact same thing. He will only eat teething crackers and drink his bottle. This has been going on for about a week. Prior to this, he had a hearty appetite and would eat just about anything put in front of him! Hoping for any input or suggestions!posted 12/16/2010 by Bmaggi0623

Gossamer Gear Air Beam....
Edited by norcalweaver on 02/15/2013 19:24:06 MST.
Thanks Matt! I had started a thread about these kinds of "frames," wondering about their practical use. Good to see some reports coming out.
Do you find this pad to be cooler than your sitlight pad when used as the back frame in your pack? Do the chambers allow more air flow?
Today it was in the low 50s with a real light breeze so really it was ideal hiking weather and kept me from ever getting hot, back or anywhere else. When I was hiking in the hotter weather last year though I do remember getting some warm spots from the sitlight pad, because I never felt like the pad was evenly distributed against my back. It laid heavy on the backs of my shoulder blades and lower back, but squished in so it didn't feel like just the dimples were contacting me, more like a solid piece of warm foam laying across those contact areas. But, as said I haven't hiked with the air frame in comparably hot temperatures, but this frame contacts my whole back very evenly; I don't feel like one spot is being smashed against me any more then another area. So, it feels like it's sitting lighter on the back which I think will cut down on the "warm spots" I was experiencing before. Some of this is speculation though on my part, I'll find out for sure in a couple months with some real world warm weather testing.
Matt,Thank you for the write up. It sounds as if the AB may improve the comfort and load carrying capacity of your GG pack by quite a bit. I just received my Kumo in the mail a few days ago and it'll be interesting to hear how you and others like carrying the AB as opposed to the flimsy CCF pad. I am too interested in the potential for how well it keeps sweat off ones back. Speaking of which, I wonder if Gossamer will come out with an estimated R-Value? ;)
Edited by timdcy on 02/16/2013 08:59:08 MST.
"I wonder if Gossamer will come out with an estimated R-Value?"With no internal insulation, baffles or reflective layers, the pad is simply an air space, which is R-1.0.
Edited by dandydan on 02/17/2013 08:30:11 MST.
So I'll preface this with the disclaimer that I am prejudiced to an air frame, I have a MLD Exodus FS as my primary pack and LOVE it. I've worked hard to get my base weight to rough;y 9.75 lbs for temps down into the high 20's but still prefer the carry of a true suspension, so the Exodus FS was a dream come true for me, the ARC Blast may be next.But anyway, I've been using a 2012 Murmur as a daypack and took it on one very light overnight last year. I love the pack for day trips, but with my full kit, or close to it, it deformed too much for my liking. It didn't sit very well on back and just didn't feel nearly as well placed as the Exodus FS.I just received a medium Air Beam from GG, and all I can say is WOW. It's like a whole new pack, the AB gives the pack a much more rigid structure and it transfers much more weight to my hips. Before, with the SitLight pad the hip belt was more for balance and to keep the pack from bouncing around. With the AB it can actually transfer weight and it doesn't deform with gear in it.I loaded it up with a quilt (for volume) and some crap laying around the basement to get it to ~15 lbs and walked around a bit, it's a whole new pack. If you're on the fence about adding an AB to a GG or any other pack, give it a try, I'm sure glad I just did. Now I just need to get "out there" and give it a real test.
Edited by arttyszka on 03/23/2013 11:22:39 MDT.
Interesting info on airbeam, I may end up trying one out.I would say, though, that the little Sitlight pad that GG ships with their pack is pretty pathetic at adding structure to the pack, and not much better at just being padding. I use my Murmur with the 3-panel GG Nightlite Torso in the external pad pockets and a rolled up 3/16"x72" GG pad inside the pack with main items packed inside that pad's hollow cylinder. Like the Airbeam my pad combination is way better than the puny GG Sitlight, and just the 3-panel GG Nightlight Torso alone would be too. I'm kind of curious how the thicker Nightlight Torso compares to the Airbeam, with or without additional pad tube in main body of pack.

Silver is my new Silver Laced Wyandotte and I got her for free from an old family friend of ours who had two hens and one died, and she thought silver would be happier with the companionship of my younger pullets. She is about 6 years old and they are about 3 1/2 months. I let them in the yard together and they all took turns coming up and getting aquainted. I seperated Silver off with a bit of chicken wire when I put them back in the run for a while. That evening all seemed okay so we took down the seperator and let her in with the others and she did fine. I was amazed at how calm she was, and that night she went into the coop with my other girls and was totally fine. She is an older bird, and her laying is starting to decline, but her previous owner says she does still get eggs from her so I will be excited when she settles in enough to lay one. She is a beautiful addition to my already colorful flock! She is big too, with a fat feathery backside, she's so funny when she gallops across the yard.

Kiko Martinez travels to Belfast today to defend the European super bantamweight title against unbeaten Carl Frampton, with Lee Selby facing Martin Lindsay and Andy Lee returning on the undercard.
Today at 3 pm EST on Sky Sports in the UK, Carl Frampton challenges Kiko Martinez for the European super bantamweight title in what should be a rollicking main event from the Odyssey Arena in Belfast.
Frampton (15-0, 10 KO) has developed into a super bantamweight contender in a very short amount of time, and has become one of the young standouts of UK boxing. Martinez (27-3, 19 KO) is a very solid and capable fighter himself, currently riding a seven-fight win streak after 2009 defeats to Rendall Munroe and Takalani Ndlovu.
On the undercard, Lee Selby (13-1, 5 KO) defends the British featherweight title against Martin Lindsay (20-1, 7 KO), another challenger who expects to hold some home field advantage on the night. Also, middleweight Andy Lee (28-2, 20 KO) returns, facing Anthony Fitzgerald (13-3, 4 KO) in a comeback bout following Lee's TKO loss to Julio Cesar Chavez Jr last June in Texas.
BLH will have live coverage and updates from the show, so join us for some afternoon boxing!

Badminton shoe shop in central London?
Hi,
Does anyone know if there are any shops in central-ish London that have a decent stock of badminton shoes please?
Thanks!
Only place I can think of might be Decathlon in Surrey Quays next to Canada water station
you could try the Asics flagship store on Oxford street, you might like the Progressive/Blade/Blast. Prices are RRP but once you know what you want you can shop around. For other models maybe Wigmore sports in Wigmore St. Just behind Selfridges, they have a basement for Badminton and a franchise in Harrods I believe.

Over the years, we’ve made a few dozen of these. It’s always fun for my son to pull them out and see how much better hid got over the years. Use a paint marker to add the date to each one, and even the name of each family member. Your tree will look so wonderful decorated with these unique ornaments!
What you need:
- Glass ball ornaments
- Acrylic craft paint in holiday colors
- Empty egg carton
- Ribbon for hangers (or standard ornament hangers)
- Water
- Paintbrush
- Clear glaze spray suitable for glass ***Optional, see note below.
How to make it:
- Remove the hanger top from each ornament and set aside.
- Place egg carton upside down and place ball ornaments in the middle of four egg cups to act as your holder.
- Place some paint in a palette and water the paint down until it begins to drip off the paintbrush.
- Keep the paint palette close to your egg carton holder. Dip paintbrush into the watered down paint, picking up a generous amount. Move the paintbrush to the top of the ornament immediately. Place a dollop of paint onto the ornament. If it doesn’t begin to drip down, add some more paint until it does. Continue this technique around the ornament, alternating colors as well. When finished, allow the ornaments to dry completely.
- Once the ornaments are dry, replace the hanger tops and tie ribbon in place.
- Hang ornaments on a dowel or strong twig, and then in a well-ventilated area, spray with clear glaze spray. Let dry completely. ***NOTE: This is optional. Sometimes I haven’t sprayed them and as long and you pack them carefully, the paint seems to hold up well.
Tips:
- Using the egg carton as a holder will cause the paint to stop where the paint drips down and meets the egg carton. You can avoid this by hanging the ornaments on something sturdy while you paint, just be sure that you have newspaper below to catch the drips.
- The thicker the paint, the darker your drips will be. If you would like lighter drips, thin out the paint more.

Former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic collaborated with Bosnian Serb chiefs to maximise military advantage, a witness at his trial said.
“The relationship between the Bosnian Serb leadership and the Croatian Serb leadership was quite consistently good,” historian Christian Nielsen testified at Hadzic’s trial at the Hague Tribunal on Thursday.
He said that their strategic goal was to link up all Serb-controlled territories of Bosnia and Croatia during the 1990s fighting.
As part of its evidence, the prosecution presented a video of a meeting between Hadzic, former president of Republika Srpska and convicted war criminal Biljana Plavsic, Goran Hadzic and Serbian paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan.
According to the the Croatian areas in order “to make it a part of new Serb-dominated state”, the indictment alleges.
Serb forces forcibly removed Croats and non-Serbs from areas of Croatia that they controlled, Nielsen said in his report presented at the trial.
He said that not only Croats but other minority groups were also targeted.
“Slovaks asked for protection [from Serbian forces] from the authorities in Belgrade. One of the reasons why Serbs targeted Slovaks was Slovakia was, like Croatia, a [Nazi German] puppet state during World War II,” Nielsen said.
In his report, he spoke of the circumstances that led to the conflicts in Croatia.
“The 1990 elections in Croatia led to the victory of nationalistic parties on both sides, such as the Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ, and on the other side the Serb Democratic Party, which also got a lot of votes,” Nielsen said.
He said that “Serbs reacted negatively to the victory of the HDZ and Franjo Tudjman being president, as this victory has been linked to the past oppression of Serbs in Croatia during World War II.”
“The rhetoric of Franjo Tudjman denied the suffering of Serbs during World War II resulting in extreme anxiety of Serbs in Croatia. This situation was manipulated by Serb politicians,” he added..
His trial will resume on Friday..

Is Kevin Durant the next Kobe Bryant after all? Team USA fans are certainly swaggering today after their guys’ strong showing in upending the defending FIBA world champions, 86-85.
Durant was the alpha dog for the US – a role many including BiE worried about going unfilled a la my least-favorite 2006 team – in scoring.
Tags: Danny Granger, Derrick Rose, Juan Carlos Navarro, Kevin Love, Kobe Bryant, Mike Krzyzewski, Rajon Rondo, Ricky Rubio, Team Spain, Team USA, YouTube
Actually, not bad Spain, not bad at all…. A game between the two favourites ends with 1 point difference… I’d say we’re set for a good and competitive tournament (one can only hope), where there is at least two teams that demonstrated they can beat the US (Lithunia is the other one – Greece will be added on Wed.
).
Greece and US are only remaining undefeated teams. I hope you change the rankings accordingly.
Spain number 3 now, Mika (ironic nod)?
Spain was lucky not to win. Usually in this kind of situation – two equal teams first meet in a friendly, then a bit later in a do-or-die game – team that wins the meaningless game later loses the important one. That has happened a lot of times in sports. To be honest, it is a bit strange to see WC favourites USA, Spain and Greece meeting like this in a situation where they will probably go against each other in World Cup semifinal and/or final.
With Durant playing D like that down the stretch you’d better have a second scoring option if you want to pull one out against the US. What a monster. It’s going to be a fun tournament.
Calderon is out, Scariolo will most likely call Raul Lopez to replace him.
Very entertaining game. Espana came out like zombies in the first quarter, but lessons were learned on both sides, no doubt. Why the odd rotation by Coach K?
I’d agree with rookie, but that wasn’t the case in the Olympics.
USA, except Durant, didn’t look impressive, just barely beating Spain even though their shooting was off. I don’t think they’ll have that margin for error against Greece. I’m really looking forward to that game!
OS what are your thoughts on this? It is certainly raising some eyebrows around Europe. It reminds me of Coach K’s 2006 post game interview after the US-Greece game………
unreal…………
Interview of Russell Westbrook in Athens.
Greek reporter.
Russell you were just 18 y.o. when USA team lost from Greece and lost the ticket for the final game on previous WC in Japan. What do you remember from that game?
Russell Westbrook.
Nothing. I haven’t watch previous WC games of USA. I don’t even know when that happened. What year did you say we lost from Greece?
Well. I just hope that wont happen again.
I don’t get how hard it is for you guys to understand that most American’s don’t really give a damn about the World Championships. It sucks, but why would an 18 year old Russell Westbrook preparing for his first season at UCLA waste his evening watching USA games when he is living out his last days before college starts?
[...] Speaking of alpha’s, Kevin Durant… More from NewsOK. [...]

With, at one point it was eyed as expandable for a Major League Baseball team -- York County actually has some good options and could unlock much value unrelated to baseball.
One potential use that would reclaim much of the ballpark and the surrounding area: an equestrian center combined with a county fairgrounds. York County has already researched the market potential for such a facility; look for it to be discussed in coming months. From the Enquirer Herald:
One possibility would be an agri-tourism center with an emphasis on events related to horses. In 2007, the county agreed to invest up to $100,000 in hospitality tax money to explore the possibility of such a center, and the research still is on track.
Early plans included an arena for equestrian events as a key component. The idea is to capitalize on a thriving horse culture in the county as well as to attract horse owners from other areas with easy access for trailers from I-77.
Surveys show that York County has one of the highest horse populations in the state. The surveys also estimate that the county rakes in more than $20 million a year in horse-related business.

“Our modern society is filled with sudden events (sirens, horns, ringing phones, alarms, televisions, etc.) that hijack attention. By contrast, natural environments are associated with a gentle, soft fascination, allowing the executive attentional system to replenish.”
If that sounds like a far-fetched ad for the Sierra Club, consider that studies have found that taking a hike or otherwise spending some time in nature has been shown to help people do better on laboratory tests (like controlling the perceived rotation of a Necker Cube) as well as real-life tasks, like proof reading.
If spending a few hours in nature is a good thing, what about a few days? That was the question psychologists from the University of Kansas and the University of Utah sought to answer.
So the researchers turned to 26 women and 30 men who took Outward Bound wilderness expeditions to Alaska, Colorado, Maine or Washington. Each trip lasted for four to six days, during which time any use of technology was strictly forbidden.
To test creativity, the psychologists used the Remote Associates Test, which asks subjects to find the link between related cues (for instance, “coin,” “quick” and “spoon” all go with the word “silver”). Study participants were asked to solve 10 of these puzzles, and their score was the number they got correct. A total of 24 backpackers took the test before they started their journeys, and 32 people took the test on the morning of their fourth day in.
How did they do?
Those who took the test before they had sojourned with nature answered 4.14 of the “questions” correctly, on average, while those who took the test after three days in the wilderness got an average of 6.08 “questions” right. That may not sound like a big difference, but it’s an increase of 50%, the study authors noted.
The results demonstrate “that higher-order cognitive skills improve with sustained exposure to a natural environment,” the researchers wrote.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean that exposure to nature deserves all of the credit for the creativity boost. Spending time in a natural environment probably does help recharge the brain. But so does taking a break from all of the high-tech gadgets and other attention-grabbing distractions that dominate our lives when we are not communing with nature, they noted.
You can find a link to the study from the PLoS One website.
(And in case you were wondering, I am not related to Stephen Kaplan and Rachel Kaplan of the University of Michigan, who have long studied the psychological benefits of spending time in nature and are credited with developing Attention Restoration Theory.)

In a move that will help some 800 Maryland families affected by the effects of Hurricane Sandy, Congress approved $10 billion in emergency funding Friday for the federal flood insurance program.
The hastily scheduled votes came in response to criticism from Republicans — notably New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — who publicly complained that GOP leadership in the House of Representatives was dragging its feet on the aid package.
The House approved the measure, 354-67. The Senate passed the legislation unanimously, without a roll call vote, sending it to President Barack Obama for his signature.
The flood program, created in 1968, is expected to run out of money in coming days, complicating insurance claims for thousands of families in New York, New Jersey and other states that were hit by the storm.
About 800 claims are pending from Maryland, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Eastern Shore, and Somerset County in particular, experienced damaging floods after the storm.
The bill is the first of two Congress will take up to address dwindling disaster relief funds. The House is expected to vote Jan. 15 on a more controversial measure that includes an additional $50 billion in aid. That legislation would guarantee additional aid for Maryland, though the precise amount would be determined later.
Christie, who leveled stinging criticism of his own party over the issue earlier in the week, released a joint statement Friday with New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, calling the insurance bill a "necessary and critical first step" but "just a down payment" toward aiding their states.
The Senate passed a $60.4 billion aid package last month, though the bill faced criticism over proposed spending not directly related to Sandy.
Several lawmakers criticized the decision not to hold a vote on that bill on Jan. 1, after Congress wrapped up work on "fiscal cliff" legislation, raising taxes on high-income households to avert automatic tax increases and spending cuts.
"While it is never too late to do the right thing, it is late that we are doing this thing," Rep. Steny Hoyer of Southern Maryland, the second-highest-ranking Democrat in the House, said of the insurance bill. "We are doing only the bare minimum. … We should have acted almost immediately."
Rep. Andy Harris, who represents the Eastern Shore, was one of 67 Republicans to vote against the proposal. He said Thursday that he will not support the bill unless budget cuts are found to pay for the additional spending. In a statement Friday, he said the current flood program needs to be reformed.
"The bill increased the program's borrowing limit from $20.7 billion to $30 billion with no plan to pay for it, and included no plans to make sure we would not have to bail out the program again in the near future," Harris said.
In the House, all Democrats and 161 Republicans voted for the measure.
Maryland Democrats pounced on Harris' vote, calling it "shameful and outrageous" in a statement.
The flood legislation does not authorize direct spending; rather, it gives the flood insurance program authority to borrow money to pay claims during times of heavy flooding. In the past, those loans have been repaid with premiums property owners pay to carry the insurance.
For decades, the program has repaid the loans, but the fund went deeply into debt following Hurricane Katrina and now is nearly $18 billion in the red, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.
Still, the program is making payments on that debt, including $750 million in the first half of 2011 and $500 million in 2010.
Sandy, a hurricane before the center of the storm made landfall Oct. 29 in New Jersey, caused more than 125 deaths in the United States.

L makes some interesting points. The skull is as close as human cultures come to a universal symbol.
Death is, of course, in common with taxation, the fate of all of homo sapiens. Of this fact, the bare grinning cranium is the most obvious sign, and in the past, even a century ago, it and other representations of earthly transience were ubiquitous.
The effect.
At the heart of the show, if that's the correct anatomical metaphor, are works related to the European traditions of the Dance of Death. Many medieval churches and cemeteries contained paintings of cheery, mobile skeletons, capering with varying degrees of ghoulish humor and sometimes playing a fiddle or other instrument, leading everyone, young and old, rich and poor, into the fatal dance.

With its compact, tulip-shaped design, the BeoLab 11 subwoofer combines excellent bass performance with a unique and elegant design that complements any décor.
There is nothing conventional about BeoLab 11. With its compact, tulip-shaped form, BeoLab 11 has both a strong sculptural presence and a discreetness that will integrate perfectly into any interior. The days of hiding your subwoofer behind the sofa or in a darkened corner of the room are gone. You will want to put BeoLab 11 on display.
With its compact, tulip-shaped design, the BeoLab 11 subwoofer combines excellent bass performance with a unique and elegant design that complements any décor. The aluminium outer shell partly conceals the black surfaces of the two drivers facing each other on the inside. The intriguing design of BeoLab 11 will make you want to put it on display, instead of hiding it away like conventional boxy subwoofers.
Questioning the ordinary is what our highly-skilled designers do best. So by creating an elegant, compact subwoofer that produces minimal vibration, our designers were able to create one of the first wall-mountable subwoofers on the market.
Beneath its glossy shell, BeoLab 11 holds true to the Bang & Olufsen tradition of providing breathtaking sound quality in loudspeakers. Able to produce the lowest frequencies with stunning clarity and precision, adding this compact subwoofer to your setup will produce a richer, more complete sound experience that will enrich your favourite music or film.
BeoLab 11 brings a whole new level of detail to your favourite music. Whether it's the thump of the bass drum or rhythmic beat of the bass guitar, you will hear things that you never heard before. It's as though your favourite artists are performing in the same room, just for you.
With its elegant, tulip-shaped form, you could be forgiven for thinking that BeoLab 11 is somewhat of a lightweight as far as subwoofers go. This couldn't be farther from the truth. With its built-in 200W ICEpower amplifier and two 6½-inch drivers, BeoLab 11 delivers deep, enthralling bass that belies its compact design.
As well as being a master class in design, BeoLab 11 is also a showcase of sophisticated advanced technology. Take, for example, the two opposing drivers, which take advantage of the Acoustic Balance Principle – a first for a Bang & Olufsen subwoofer design. This configuration leads to the drivers producing 'in-phase' frequencies, which effectively eliminates almost all unwanted vibrations from the unit..

Eric Soiland, CIMA: In his own words
Eric
Soiland is a Certified Investment Management Analyst who has been
working with pre-retired and retired clients for 20 years; the last
nine of them working for Citi Smith Barney in Walnut Creek, Calif.
Risk
Typically, most people look at risk as the potential for fluctuation
or loss in an investment portfolio. Another risk is running out
of money before they die. That could be due to inflation, health
care costs, long-term care costs or unforeseen events. I try to
get them to picture in their mind the best portfolio we can put
together that will help them maintain their current lifestyle. Over
a 20-, 30- or 40-year retirement you need to have growth to counter
inflation. A lot of individuals automatically think that when they
get near retirement they need to become very conservative. That
may have been true many years ago when people died five or 10 years
after retirement, but it's not the case now.
I don't twist anybody's arm; I just explain the trade-off.
If you want to sleep extremely well now then the trade-off may be
that down the road you won't be sleeping well because your portfolio
hasn't kept up with inflation. If you're willing to take a little
more risk many times you can greatly enhance the odds in your favor.
I try to get the overly conservative investor to see the sense of
a more diversified, more aggressive portfolio.
The zone
What is most important, in my opinion, is the five years before retirement and the five years after retirement. It's a zone, a 10-year window, that's very critical for most retirees.
A lot of planning goes into the five years leading
up to retirement. That's when you want to review your current assets,
estimate anticipated assets, determine your expenses, check your
insurance coverage and work up a plan with your financial adviser
to see if there's a gap that needs to be overcome. Then, if you
can get through the first five years of retirement without any really
negative setbacks to principal, there's a good chance you can maintain
your current lifestyle in retirement if you stick with a prudent
withdrawal plan.
Start early
The sooner people get serious about retirement, the better. If someone has 20 years to go before retirement and they start planning now, they're in a much better position to know what they need to save and to be able to hit that goal than someone who's two years away from retirement and is finding out they haven't done a very good job.

Q: What opportunities do health savings accounts (HSAs) offer banks?
Doug Marrs, Great Southern Bancorp: Health savings accounts provide an important service for customers with high-deductible healthcare plans. It helps these customers save in a tax-advantaged way to help meet future medical expenses. The need for HSAs is growing as more employers move to high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). We began offering HSAs, first and foremost, as a meaningful service for customers with HDHPs. Offering this product gives our company a competitive advantage in the marketplace and provides an opportunity to attract new deposit relationships and deepen existing customer relationships.
Jim Baron, Huntington Bank: By providing HSAs to business banking customers, we give them the opportunity to lower the cost of providing health insurance to employees, provide an added benefit to employees at no cost and take the administration work out of their benefits department. Customers see HSAs as a financial product, not a healthcare product. They also want to open an HSA with their local bank -- an institution they can trust and with whom they have done business. Additionally, small businesses want to offer HSAs to be more competitive when recruiting employees. The opportunity to grow deposit balances with HSAs is enhanced by employer contributions. More and more employers are funding HSAs on behalf of their employees, a trend which promises to increase average balances even more in the future. In addition, the recent rule change that allows rollovers from an IRA into an HSA has provided a source of added balance growth.
Kirsten Trusko, BearingPoint: This is the first major, new opportunity for banks in decades. By 2012 there will be an estimated 30 million HSAs with $325 billion in deposits contributing to $7 billion in consumer-directed healthcare (CDH) revenue. This money will be dispersed among divisions throughout commercial, retail and investment banks. Because HSAs have tentacles back to commercial and retail customers, these accounts deepen across spending, saving and investing functions, making stickier existing relationships and potentially attracting new clients seeking full-service offerings in health banking.
Dana Gould, Financial Insights: The balances on HSAs are accumulating, but consumers don't do a lot of transactions on them -- they are not very active accounts. And because these accounts are established through employers, banks won't have to do a lot of customer service on them. Banks can make money off the deposits; HSAs offer a good opportunity to gain new customers; and because this type of account is a retirement account as well as a health fund, people will not tend to move these accounts around from place to place, so they're more stable.
Q: What are the technology requirements for banks looking to compete in the HSA space in terms of processing, security, reporting and records management?
Marrs, Great Southern Bancorp: Before launching our HSA product to the marketplace, our software vendor provided in-depth training to our staff to ensure compliance with processing standards, security, reporting and records management. Our goal was to have certain staff members become HSA subject experts from the beginning because we anticipated many questions about the product. Our HSA experts then trained our front-line associates on the product.
Baron, Huntington Bank: Customers are demanding all the usual bells and whistles that come with their other bank accounts, including debit cards, checks, online access to accounts, and ATM and branch access. Banks need to be prepared to service the customer in whatever channel the customer prefers. These accounts are transactional in nature and cannot be serviced like an institutional product, such as a 401(k).
Trusko, BearingPoint: Most regulations have been geared toward making HSAs simpler in order to attract more banks, rather than adding complexity. Security concerns of incremental health data have largely been addressed by banks' compliance officers, confirming they are or are not HIPAA-covered entities (which is largely driven by the degree of integration to the insurance carriers and the data that entails). For noncovered entities, banking security capabilities have been deemed adequate. For covered entities, banks have developed specific manners of addressing this incremental security area. Reporting on HSAs is defined by the IRS and is very similar to [the process for] IRAs/401(k)s. Thus, most banks are leveraging these existing capabilities to fulfill HSA requirements.
Gould, Financial Insights: The best way for banks to meet technology requirements would be to partner with someone already doing HSAs, such as HSA Bank [Sheboygan, Wis.; a division of Webster Bank], for instance, or a technology company. There are plenty of software companies out there to help in the security, processing, records management and reporting. I believe there will be little need for customer-facing technology, since these accounts are typically managed through employers.
Q: What are the success factors for banks competing in the HSA space, specifically in the areas of technology and in meeting regulatory and legal requirements?
Marrs, Great Southern Bancorp: To be successful in the HSA space, banks must understand the product software and the product's legal and regulatory requirements, and stay updated on changes and communicate these changes to customers and front-line associates. End-of-year reporting is a critical piece.
Baron, Huntington Bank: Key to success in the HSA market in terms of technology is designing the customer touchpoints for the account holder and not for the distribution channel, such as a legacy cash management system. Although banks may provide assistance to businesses in using such a cash management system to fund their employees' HSAs, the HSA product itself must be designed for the individual consumer -- for example, with a simple-to-use online enrollment process, online access to accounts and ATM access. Many banks have found that working with an experienced partner can increase time to market on the technology side and also in terms of meeting regulatory/legal requirements, such as tax reporting and transaction coding.
Trusko, BearingPoint: There are two options currently available: outsourcing and building in-house (not licensable software). There are more than 12 vendors that can support HSAs in varying capacities as an outsourced function. This gives speed to market but can present challenges in profitability, differentiation and integration for core banking systems and customer service in the long haul. Banks that are building in-house are finding that trying to use legacy systems not intended to support all facets (deposit, card, investment, loan, carrier interface, etc.) is costly and time-consuming.
Guidance in regulatory and legal requirements is being provided by a number of sources. Those doing this successfully include the ABA's HSA group and a few top law firms that have specialized in this area from the start, which are being retained by many top banks to ease the minds of their compliance and regulatory leaders.
Q: Going forward, will banks be more involved in the health insurance and healthcare market?
Marrs, Great Southern Bancorp: HSAs are an example of how banks can provide helpful interfacing services for customers and their insurance needs. Perhaps more innovative products and services ties with the insurance industry will be developed. But it is unlikely that most banks will become competitors or players in the general insurance space.
Baron, Huntington Bank: Many in the industry believe banks will win in the HSA market, due to the fact that consumers consider HSAs a financial product and prefer their local bank when opening an HSA. And with good reason -- early entries into the HSA market by insurance companies have experienced servicing challenges. Unlike insurance plans, HSAs require expertise in transaction processing and customer service aimed at the individual, rather than the institution. Banks clearly have the advantage in these areas.

Recently, Capital One unveiled a light-hearted digital video series intended to promote its mobile banking offering.
Banks have been wading into social media, including video, somewhat cautiously, figuring out the best way to engage customers -- and potential future customers -- without appearing overbearing.
Capital One, among others, have utilized one of the best ways to do this: humor.
I asked Pat McLean, VP, Brand Strategy for Capital One, about how the bank is using video as part of it's overall social media plan.
Bank Systems & Technology: How big of a role does video play in Capital One's overall social media strategy?
McLean: Video is becoming a more important medium in our social media strategy. There are things you can do with video on social media that you can’t do on other channels, such as build a story quicker. Video as part of our social media strategy will continue to grow and become more prominent.
BS&T: Is Capital One promoting an upgrade or new version of its mobile banking, or is this to raise awareness to its existing mobile banking product?
McLean One of the main drivers of mobile adoption is simply awareness, which we expect this campaign to generate in the typical, entertaining Capital One way. Mobile is an integrated part of Capital One’s marketing communications strategy and is an increasingly important channel for acquiring and servicing customers. We did launch a new version of our mobile app late last year, which sported a new look and feel. Through the ads we are directing users to. This is serves as our microsite where we provide customers information on the benefits of using mobile banking.
BS&T: How does Capital One envision social media overall as a channel, is it for customer engagement only or for also potentially delivering financial services, if not now then in the future?
McLean: Social media is a great place to interact with customers. We have a multi-channel strategy that is tailored for each channel. Ultimately, it is about meeting customers in their channel of choice, which will often depend on where they are and what they are doing. Social media is a place for conversation and interaction. At the moment, it is not a place to transact. There are other preferable channels, which are tried, tested and secure.

American Express announced it is teaming up with social media site Twitter to offer its cardholders the ability to purchase products from a select group of companies by tweeting special hashtags.
Amex customers who sync their eligible cards and tweet special #hashtags can buy American Express gift cards and products from Amazon, Sony, Urban Zen and Xbox 360. Users can sync their cards at sync.americanexpress.com.
American Express said the program is powered by its Card Sync technology. After tweeting with the specially designated hashtag, users then receive a personal Twitter response from the @AmexSync account within 15 minutes to confirm the purchase. All products will then be shipped to the customer's billing address via free two-day shipping, the company said.
American Express has had a partnership with Twitter since last March on a daily deals-type of program, where Amex card holders can tweet using customized hashtags, and couponless deals are loaded directly onto their cards.
"Based on the initial success of Amex Sync for offers, we know there is significant power in combining our assets with Twitter's platform to bring value to card members and merchants," said Leslie Berland, SVP, Digital Partnerships and Development at American Express, in a statement.

I'll be leading a workshop or teaching a class and someone will ask about the handouts I use.
"You have so many," I'll hear, and "How did you afford to make so many copies?"
And then I smile.
It was in the spring of the year 2000. The church I served at that time needed a new office photocopier machine. We had talked with several companies and finally had it down to two distributors. We had chosen the specific machine that was in our cost range and that we could afford with our budget.
One manager decided to "loan" us a machine so that we could try it out. When I arrived at the office after an early morning meeting I found that he had brought a photocopier machine that was beyond the scope of our expectation.
That's putting it mildly.
This salesman had his technicians bring a professional printing machine, one that covered the entire north wall of the office (about fourteen feet).
"That's not even close to the machine we're looking at," I exclaimed.
"Hey, try it out over the weekend and see if you want to move up to it," he responded. "Make as many copies as you want. No charge."
So I did.
I was finishing my second dissertation and needed ten copies of it. Those were made that weekend. I made one hundred copies of each of my teaching handouts. I made copies of a couple of rare books I owned at the time.
I made copies of District files that we ... might need someday.
I went to a local office store and purchased boxes of paper.
In other words, I got carried away.
The manager returned on Tuesday and we informed him that we still were not interested in this massive machine.
"Fine," he said, "I'll have the techs pick it up this afternoon."
And then he looked at the counter.
"This can't be right," he said. "I brought in a brand new machine but it now lists over seventeen thousand copies."
I just smiled.
Every once in a while the universe will open a door, offer us a gift, and touch us with a blessing. Sometimes these come with great fanfare, but usually they come with little advanced recognition. You have to be willing to see the opportunity and recognize it when it comes.
You have to be willing to act upon it, seize the moment, go for the gold.
Ten years ago I had a salesman "bless me" with one such opportunity that I'm still using today. Over the years there have been several others as well. Eventually this becomes a philosophy about life. It's not that you feel entitled.
However, you're not going to close a door that's opening your way. In fact, you open the door(s) and walk through.
And when you do, you need to smile in that mischievous way that says to the world "isn't it great how things have worked out."
Take a look around you at the people who may be smiling that way today!
Great story! Thanks so much for sharing! :))

Often called "Painter of the People," Andrew Newell Wyeth is best known for his painting "Christina," which portrays a young woman crawling through a field toward an old farmhouse. Although Wyeth's wife, Betsy, posed for the picture, Christina was a real person whose legs were paralyzed.
In 1986, the painter revealed a huge collection of works featuring Helga, Wyeth's neighbor in Pennsylvania. Wyeth died in January 2009 at the age of 91. This American painter's original works are on display in most major US museums. Andrew Wyeth posters can bring this great artist's work right into your home or office.

In this collection of approximately 40 brief poems, Maddox focuses on aspects of the game from pitching and hitting to base-running and fielding. Her carefully constructed word pictures offer dramatic snapshots of infield flies and collisions between fielders, sacrifice bunts, balks and pitch-outs, stolen bases, and grand slams. "A Strike by any other name is a (sometimes) foul, is a swing/that swats only air, is doing nothing when the ball's right there-/three times is an out is an out is an out." An umpire and a player face off in the large illustration laid across one spread: under the umpire, the poem "Out" concludes "...all hard-pitched hope outthrown, thrown out/of luck, of heart, of the hard heat of summer/and what won't be." On the facing page, the poem "Safe" states, "...What-could-be hunkers down here,/dares to snare the numbers,/spike out the sure thing,/outlaw the out.".-Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA
Overview
Here's a celebration of baseball in poetry and the poetry in baseball. Baseball is a game of fine points and grand gestures, small blunders and bold accomplishments—the hook slide into second, the humble bunt, the unexpected wild pitch, the bases-loaded home run. Poet and baseball fan Marjorie Maddox pays tribute to these and other details that make the national pastime an enduring and engaging sport for players and fans alike. Surprising wordplay and striking images offer a unique perspective of this classic ...

'Queen' delights residents with a Jubilee tour of nursing homes
8:40am Thursday 14th June 2012 in Letters
My 12-year-old Golden Cocker Spaniel Sophie joined in the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations by dressing up as the Queen.
As my dog is a registered Pets as Therapy visiting dog, and has been for the last 10 years, she is able to visit hospitals, nursing homes etc, where she brings a lot of joy and love to both patients and residents.
Over the Jubilee weekend myself and Sophie visited Springbank and College Fields nursing homes in Barry to help celebrate the Jubilee by holding entertainment and a party for the residents.
Sophie, who was dressed as the Queen, wore a royal blue dress with red, white and blue bows, silver and pink necklace, earrings and tiara.
I am pleased to say all nursing home residents had a good time and all loved my dog Sophie dressed as the Queen!

On April 17, 2001, Barry Bonds became the seventeenth Major League player to hit five-hundred home runs, and probably the first to do it with a splash! Bonds' two-run, eighth-inning drive off Terry Adams went into San Francisco Bay and led the Giants over the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-to-2.
The homer off Adams Willie McCovey - also members of the five-hundred home runs club - were whisked by a golf cart to a ceremony at home plate.

Declared free agents earned their freedom on Nov. 3, five days after the conclusion of the World Series. These players' minor league contracts expired following the 2012 season and they failed to reach an agreement with their organizations for the 2013 season. See the complete 2012 free agent listing for a full team-by-team listing.
Elected free agents (also known as Article XX-D free agents) gained their freedom after refusing outright assignments to the minors after being removed from the 40-man roster.
Latin American winter league assignments are listed for participating free agents: DL (Dominican), MPL (Mexican Pacific), PRL (Puerto Rican) and VL (Venezuelan). A handful of players spend time in the Australian Baseball League (ABL), now in its third year.
Any player listed with an asterisk (*) signed a major league contract and joined the 40-man roster.

The body of Baltimore Orioles' pitcher, executive, and broadcaster Mike Flanagan was found near his home on Wednesday, and the initial reports indicated that Flanagan might have committed suicide. Sadly, it looks like those reports are proving true. From Chick Hernandez of CSN Washington:
Baltimore Co. Police confirm Mike Flanagan died from self-inflicted gun shot. So very sad
While it's not appropriate to play amateur psychologist and pretend this horrible occurrence is the result of one specific problem in Flanagan's life, there are reports that part of his depression stemmed from his work in the Orioles' front office. From Tim Kurkjian:
"Flanny," as everyone called him, had not been his usual personable, hilarious self in recent years. The many losses he took as the Orioles general manager wore on him, and he took them home. Being replaced as GM in 2008 depressed him even more.
WBAL-TV 11 Sports Director Gerry Sandusky was even more specific, saying ...
Flanagan took his own life "despondent over what he considered a false perception from a community he loved of his role in the team's prolonged failure," Sandusky said.
It's not like this story was going to get less sad, but it hits home when you realize he really struggled with the criticism that fans don't think twice about doling out.

Hundreds of street lights to be replaced in Tadley
5:10pm Monday 21st January 2013 in News By Helen Morton
THE streets of Tadley should be better lit by the summer as contractors for Hampshire County Council replace hundreds of street lights with more up-to-date lamps.
Much of the lighting is more than 30 years old and will be replaced with the latest technology in energy-saving lamps and dimming controls. In Tadley, 314 lamps will be replaced along with a further 916 lanterns and posts.
It is hoped this will mean better lighting, less light pollution due to the new lights facing downwards, improved safety and a reduction in carbon emissions in line with Government targets for carbon reduction.
Councillor Mel Kendal, deputy leader and executive member for transport and environment, said: “A lot of preparation and planning has gone into the Tadley Street Lighting programme, and we will try to keep disruption to a minimum. “This means co-ordinating works with other schemes and ensuring that work on key roads is planned to take place outside rush hour periods.
He added: “As well as replacing older lighting columns which are coming to the end of their life, the new lamps will improve lighting levels on the ground.”
The £225million “Street lighting private finance initiative”, that is funding the replacement programme in Hamp-shire, Southampton and West Sussex, is being undertaken in partnership with utility company Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE). It involves the replacement or updating of 150,000 street lights, illuminated signs and bollards with the latest energy-efficient equipment.

One Expert's Bracket
Sunday's Picks
by Drew Cannon
After doing pretty well for a few days, I got beat up pretty good on Friday, even if we ignore the 2-15 games. Here's to hoping that watching those games helped me figure these teams out.
(11) NC State vs. (3) Georgetown (Sunday: Columbus, 12:15 on CBS)
First instinct: Georgetown
The numbers like: Georgetown (KP - 72%, Silver - 64%, BPI - Georgetown 18, NC State 45)
Thought process: Not only has a lot of Georgetown's success defensively come from an unsustainably low opponent three-point percentage (No. 1 nationally at 27 percent), but NC State ranks near the bottom nationally in proportion of offense coming from three pointers. In other words, Georgetown's probably a little overrated because of their good three-point luck -- and even if they're not, theirs is a strength that's largely wasted on the Wolfpack. That said, the Hoyas are a little bit too big for NC State. The Wolfpack will have a tough time defending Henry Sims, Hollis Thompson, and Otto Porter with their typical lineup. I'm going back and forth on this. I think Georgetown's a bit overrated and NC State is the type of team that can give their excellent defense trouble. I'm also starting to believe that we can drop the fear of implosion with this NC State team. On the other hand, the Wolfpack drew a No. 11 seed for a reason and they will be just asking for Otto Porter to go off.
Final pick: NC State
(9) Saint Louis vs. (1) Michigan State (Sunday: Columbus, 2:45 on CBS)
First instinct: Michigan State
The numbers like: Michigan State (KP - 71%, Silver - 72%, BPI - Michigan State 4, Saint Louis 15)
Thought process: I liked this matchup a lot better for Memphis than Saint Louis. The Spartans were going to have a lot of trouble sticking to Joe Jackson, and, while Kwamain Mitchell is certainly a very good player, he doesn't have the truly blinding speed of Jackson. The Billikens' most consistent scoring option is Brian Conklin, and, while I'd tend to be concerned about his lack of size going up against Draymond Green, Adreian Payne and Derrick Nix, it hasn't seemed to bother him so far. Michigan State could have a pretty tough time scoring against SLU, and Rick Majerus should have received much more National Coach of the Year attention. But I'm just having too much trouble coming up with a reason the Billikens will win.
Final pick: Michigan State
(8) Creighton vs. (1) North Carolina (Sunday: Greensboro, 5:15 on CBS)
First instinct: North Carolina
The numbers like: North Carolina (KP - 67%, Silver - 79%, BPI - North Carolina 5, Creighton 22)
Thought process: Dougie Fresh vs. Harrison Barnes for the pride of Ames, Iowa! North Carolina tends to smother less athletic teams, but John Henson's usually a huge part of that smothering. He'd be a gigantic help against Doug McDermott, who has a legitimate claim to the title of most diverse post game outside Chapel Hill. With Henson, I'd find a Creighton win extremely surprising and, based on the reports I've read, I'm leaning toward him playing. If Henson doesn't play, this upset becomes much more possible. By picking North Carolina here, I'm picking against both of those (weighted) coin flips coming up heads.
Final pick: North Carolina
(15) Norfolk State vs. (7) Florida (Sunday: Omaha, 6:10 on TNT)
First instinct: Florida
The numbers like: Florida (KP - 93%, Silver - 92%, BPI - Florida 16, Norfolk State 180)
Thought process: Kyle O'Quinn is a really good basketball player, but Patric Young makes Ricardo Ratliffe look like a weakling. Norfolk State's big three may put up a few points, but Chris McEachin and Pendarvis Williams would both have to have phenomenal games to make this a real possibility. Lehigh's got a real shot at another win; Norfolk State would have to pull off another big-time upset.
Final pick: Florida
(13) Ohio vs. (12) South Florida (Sunday: Nashville, 7:10 on CBS)
First instinct: South Florida
The numbers like: South Florida (KP - 57%, Silver - 57%, BPI - South Florida 64, Ohio 74)
Thought process: I've consistently cast doubt on both of these teams all season long, and they've consistently made me look stupid. Anthony Collins vs. D.J. Cooper is one of the most fun match ups we'll see in this tournament. Collins has some serious turnover issues, though, and only VCU creates more turnovers than the Bobcats. And it's not just Collins -- five of the Bulls' top nine have turnover percentages above 20. I may not fully understand how either of these teams keep winning, but I understand South Florida less.
Final pick: Ohio
(15) Lehigh vs. (10) Xavier (Sunday: Greensboro, 7:45 on truth)
First instinct: Lehigh
The numbers like: Xavier (KP - 56%, Silver - 65%, BPI - Xavier 53, Lehigh 99)
Thought process: C.J. McCollum may have a tougher time of it with Tu Holloway guarding him than when that job fell to Duke's guards. It's also worth noting that it did take him 24 shots to get his 30 points against the Blue Devils. In the history of the NCAA tournament, three of the four 15-seeds to advance to the Round of 32 were beaten by double digits. The last one, Coppin State in 1997, had a chance to win in the final seconds. Lehigh is currently ranked No. 73 in the Pomeroy ratings, which is comfortably the highest of any 15-seed in the KenPom era. I'm not positive the Mountain Hawks will win, but I'm not sure exactly who can stay with Gabe Knutson, and I'm not sure anyone can stay with McCollum. I'd be surprised if Lehigh doesn't at least keep this game in doubt for a long time. I chickened out on taking the 15-seed in the first round. I'm not chickening out again.
Final pick: Lehigh
(10) Purdue vs. (2) Kansas (Sunday: Omaha, 8:40 on TNT)
First instinct: Kansas
The numbers like: Kansas (KP - 71%, Silver - 76%, BPI - Kansas 6, Purdue 43)
Thought process: What, you think someone on Purdue's roster is stopping Thomas Robinson? For the Boilermakers to win this game, someone unusual will have to go off. Their best chance is the fact that Robinson or Jeff Withey will have to guard D.J. Byrd, and neither of them wants to chase him around the three-point line.
Final pick: Kansas
(6) Cincinnati vs. (3) Florida State
First instinct: Florida State
The numbers like: Florida State (KP - 54%, Silver - 49%, BPI - Florida State 26, Cincinnati 36)
Thought process: Both of these teams looked like they just might crack down the stretch in their first NCAA tournament games, but each staved off upsets, something that has to be termed unusual for a wild Friday. In all likelihood this will be an ugly game, but if nothing else Cincinnati and Florida State know how to win ugly. Bernard James and Michael Snaer are both excellent defenders, but I have a feeling Yancy Gates and Sean Kilpatrick will present them with a lot of problems. Gates is finally putting it all together.
Final pick: Cincinnati

- Flip down door to access charcoal.9 out of 5 by 14 reviewers.
Rated 5 out of 5 by Scottymic Excellent Quality This by far has to be the best quality Habachi style grill I have ever encountered. I would recommend this to any and everybody. March 18, 2013
Rated 5 out of 5 by Cphillips Great little grill This little baby combines 2 of my favorite things, charcoal and cast iron. Here are things you will NOT do with this grill: bring it backpacking, go on a canoe camping trip or cook for 3 or more people. Here is what you will do with it: cook awesome smoky charcoal grilled meals for yourself and/or one other lucky person of your choosing in your backyard, tailgating, or a drive up camping situation. For the price I would think that this BBQ would be pretty hard to beat, if you are looking to be able to charcoal grill, with a fast prep time, for just one or 2 people. If you are thinking about it... Get it and enjoy. June 17, 2012

Over the years Kelly listened to hundreds of New CID make-up artists sharing insights that they have picked up from making up real women in the New ID studios. These women felt that make-up shopping could be overwhelming with too many fashion-led ‘shades which aren't always wearable or easy to apply.
From this information New CID Cosmetics formed and unveiled to fill that gap in the market. Today it is still shaped by the experience of those make-up artists. Bath & Unwind is pleased to add New CID cosmetics to our collection to offer this premium brand to our customers.

The Bay Street Theatre KIDS SUMMER MUSIC THEATER CAMPS will take place July 30 - August 3 (SOLD OUT) or August 6-10 (SOLD OUT)! 9:30 am - 12:30 pm daily at Studio 3 in Bridgehampton; led by Susan Galardi and Bethany Dellapolla
This camp is very popular and books up quickly. Each week long session includes classes and games incorporating every aspect of theatre including acting, singing, performance and dance.
Theatre Camp is recommended for children ages 8 to 12 years old. $425 per child or $800 for both weeks. Students are required to dress in comfortable clothes and bring their willingness to learn. Bay Street will provide the rest, including a snack.

A34 Range Rover transporter crash causes lengthy road closure
All lanes have reopened on the A34 in Hampshire after a vehicle transporter under tow struck the central barrier, shedding its load of cars.
The crash happened on the northbound carriageway near Whitchurch on Monday night. No-one was injured.
Lanes in both directions were shut for most of Tuesday.
A 29-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, driving with an insecure load and causing danger to other road users.
Hampshire police said the fully-loaded transporter was being towed by a heavy recovery vehicle when it broke free and hit the barrier, crossing on to the opposite carriageway.
No other vehicles were involved but there was "extensive damage to the road surface and barrier".
An earlier police message on Twitter described the scene as having "lots of expensive Range Rovers all over the road".

Mass protest in Rio over the distribution of oil royalties
An estimated 200,000 people have taken to the streets of Rio de Janeiro to ask Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff to veto a bill that proposes sharing oil revenues more evenly between oil-producing states.
Opponents of the bill say it will deprive Rio state of up to $35bn (£22bn; 27bn euros) over the next eight years and that this could jeopardize Rio's ability to host the 2014 World Cup and the Olympics in 2016.

Insight Questions
What led you to BBC?
My mother asked me to go to a college fair that I really didn't feel like going to, but I said ok. I saw Coach Show, who I knew from a Defender Sports Camp. After talking with him I saw very clearly the Lord was leading
me to BBC. It was that simple.
What program were you in and why?
Secondary Education English. I had, and still have, a vision for Christians entering public schools with the light of Christ. Literature is probably the easiest subject to use to begin life discussions with students, and being light in darkness naturally leads to long term opportunities to speak of Christ with them outside the school setting. I currently sub and coach in an urban public school.
How did BBC prepare you for your ministry?
God used BBC to place several key people in my life. Dr. (Jim) King's linguistics class challenged me to believe God could use my life to radically change lives around the world. Coaches (Mike) Show, (Jamie) Miller, (Mark) Chapman, and (Dwight) Peterson encouraged me greatly to pursue God and helped me become the man He has made me to be. The relationships I made with many other BBC students are invaluable, several of whom have dribbled races around the country, including Adam Reinking (Indiana, 2008), Josh Waldron (Atlanta, 2008), Nate Logan (Tampa Bay, 2009), Ashley Ten Kate (New York City, 2009), Justin Cook (New Jersey, 2009), and Laurie Plante and Kellyn Lovell (Philadelphia, 2010).
How did Dribble the World start?
During my college years I began developing a passion for acting against world poverty. I specifically remember a chapel message that Paul Jackson, then president of EBM, preached on Galatians 2:1-10. He showed Paul's concern for the accuracy of the Gospel he was preaching and the warning the other apostles gave him after they approved his message: as you go out to the gentiles with the gospel, don't forget the poor.
In 2006, I decided I wanted to do something big with basketball to help rescue African orphans. I heard about the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa through the ministry of Bethesda Outreach in South Africa. My heart was burdened to do something for the millions of orphans who had lost their parents to AIDS.
One day I was thinking about my dad, who has run many marathons, including the New York City Marathon, twice. Then I thought: "Why not dribble a basketball through one of the biggest marathons in the world to raise funds and awareness for African orphans?" So I did it!
How does it work?
People who are interested in dribbling a running event contact us, and we help them get started. First they need to select which race they want to dribble and a cause they would like to benefit. We still faithfully support Bethesda Outreach, but we have discovered many other solid organizations that are doing great things to save lives. Then we help our runners get started on their training and on raising awareness and funds. Finally, when we can, we bring a group of people with bright green Dribble the World shirts to cheer them on at their races. Our desire is to use these opportunities to talk with people about our motivation, Jesus Christ.
Why Dribble the World?
Because God is glorified seeing His children use their talents for His glory. He loves seeing His people come together to labor for His name. Our God hates injustice and loves rescuing those who are victims of it. Finally, a lost world desperately needs to see the heart of God, the hearts of His children, and the invitation that is open to all to join His family.
What do you hope to accomplish?
I most of all want God to be honored in all the ways I just mentioned. One specific goal I have had since the beginning is to see a Bethesda Outreach started in each of the four countries surrounding South Africa. When we started Dribble the World, I remember reading each one had an AIDS rate of higher than 30%.
What has been your most significant success?
Any success we have had is the work of God done in the lives of our dribblers, the lives of the people who see what we do, and the precious people trapped in poverty that we labor to save.
What else have you been or are you involved in?
I now go into schools (Christian and public), churches, and youth groups with a presentation called "Create the Crossover." I use entertaining dribbling drills and tricks to share what we are doing with Dribble the World, and to inspire people to think about how God could use their talents and abilities to save lives. We also have "The X Fund," a project that promotes sexual purity within the Church by getting believers involved in combating child prostitution globally. These three efforts are the three extensions of Ball for Lives, our nonprofit organization.
What is the favorite thing you do with Dribble the World?
Having people tell me I was crazy for dribbling all those miles and then watching them cross the finish line.
What is your favorite Bible verse?
Psalm 88:11-12 (ESV): For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly. O LORD of hosts, blessed is the one who trusts in you!
How can people get involved with Dribble the World?
1. Help us spread the word about Dribble the World. Go to DribbletheWorld.com and sign up for our email updates.
2. Sign up with us to dribble a race or help us find more runners. You may not dribble or run, but you probably know someone who does. Contact us, and let's help more people Dribble the World.
3. Get behind our runners. Pray for them, email them, and donate towards their efforts.

The Fourth (or Second) of July.
The Botanical Gardens are absolutely beautiful, although the stench of the bathrooms can strike from up to 30 feet away. The gardens house a small zoo with goats, a donkey, peacocks (the sound of which reminded me of the evening hours back home in California), deer and two ostriches. Ostriches are big and mean, and I agree with Jess A. that they are the closest thing the modern world has to a velociraptor.
The embassy did a minimal but solid job, providing an open field, barbecue pits, a pleasant mix of American music and a few security guards thrown in, too. It was a loose framework that allowed me to eat a hamburger, drink a few beers, smoke half a cigar, and play wiffle-ball, ultimate frisbee and baseball.
Throwing a baseball has transformed itself into an almost Zen-like centering exercise for me while in this country. Among the trainees, we have three right-handed gloves and one lefty. I bring my glove any place where more than the nine Costesti trainees will be. It's something familiar and American, and something that combines the right amounts of concentration on the task at hand and socializing with the person you're throwing with. At the Fourth of July party, for example, I noticed and gestured toward a stranger with a baseball glove. Without speaking for the first ten minutes, we never got closer to one another than 60 feet. We communicated with the simplest of baseball hand signals: pointing in the sky for a pop-up, tapping ourselves apologetically on the chest after an errant throw and a nod and a smile after a particularly nice catch. Other than that, complete silence. It could have gone on for hours, but I was thirsty for a beer, so I hustled over for a conference, introduced myself, found out that my throwing partner was a missionary living in Chisinau, and then excused myself for a drink.
After a second beer and a few innings pitched of wiffle-ball, I found myself talking with a member of the North Carolina National Guard. He was a sturdy and confident man, aged somewhere in his early-to-mid 30s. He had had several assignments in Moldova, and had recently finished the first month of his current assignment. The U.S. has an interest in having friendly relations with the Moldovan military, and this soldier was doing his part.
"So are y'all doing training exercises with them?" I said, simultaneously throwing in a Southern tinge to my voice and shooting the majority of my military jargon in the first load.
"Well, training's a bit of a dirty word with us," the soldier said. "We call if familiarization. We show them how we do it, and then say, 'Now you have to forget this.'"
For his part, this soldier's exchange was not purely military. He was joined by a slightly-younger lady named Rodica, who was only the first of several military menРҐs Moldovan girlfriends I met throughout the day. I believe that the nine-year-old American-looking boy named Mihai with whom I played wiffle-ball was the product of such a match, and he seemed like a good kid, so I can find no objection to this portion of the cultural exchange.
Speaking of the culture, I did something this weekend that I donРҐt believe I ever would have done in America. I was rather drunk on Saturday night and had been walked home by fellow trainees Evan and Krista. Evan let me borrow his flashlight, and I headed directly to the outhouse in the back. As I stood over the hole and did what I needed to do, I cradled the flashlight between my turned neck and right shoulder. As I was preparing to turn and leave, the outhouse got dark, the load on my shoulder felt lighter, and my eye was drawn to a faint light coming from below the outhouse floor. It took me several seconds to realize that Evan's flashlight was gone and it wasn't coming back. The next morning, I went to the outhouse with latex gloves in my pocket, but I couldn't make visual contact with the flashlight, so I decided it was better not to try. My host family knows that I need to buy Evan a new flashlight in Chisinau on Wednesday, but when they asked me where I lost it, I simply replied, "Nu stiu. Sunt idiot." I don't know. I'm an idiot.

FAQ: Applying to Graduate School
Insights from a BC professor
What is Graduate School?
Graduate school is more than simply an extension of undergraduate coursework. Whether a masters or a doctoral program, graduate school is a specialized and demanding study of a field of interest in the arts or the sciences. The pursuit of graduate study within the arts and sciences is most often driven by a love of knowledge for its own sake. Many students who pursue such studies find work in academia as teachers and/or researchers, or pursue work related to their chosen field in the corporate world.
For added perspective, read Phil Agre's Advice for Undergraduates Considering Graduate School. It is a thoughtful essay discussing many considerations and realities associated with graduate school.
The Importance of Research and Relationships
Graduate school is, above all else, driven by research. Whether pursuing a doctorate in history or biology, the bulk of graduate work involves performing intensive research, either in a laboratory or a library. One should consider this reality carefully before pursuing the application process further. Ask yourself if you enjoy doing research, and if the answer is no, you may want to reconsider applying.
The other aspect of graduate school that is important to remember before, during, and after attending a program, is that it is fundamentally a relationship-intensive pursuit, and the development of relationships among other academics and scholars is a key part of the whole experience. A good relationship with a professor as an undergraduate, for example, can lead to a satisfying independent study or thesis, which can be a strong demonstration of interest in and competence for graduate research. Relationships developed with fellow students in graduate school is also critical, as these relationships will form the nucleus of your professional network in academia.
Choosing a School
Often the most valuable sources of advice regarding graduate programs are professors, staff and graduate students in those programs.
- Speak with professors, staff and graduate students here at BC - tell them what your most important criteria are and ask their opinions about the best programs.
- Email those scholars whose work you have read and admired, and ask their opinion about the best programs. You may be surprised by the number of responses you receive.
- Visit the Boston College Career Center. You can speak with a Career Counselor about graduate school and gather more information on specific schools and programs from the Career Center Library.
- Speak with the Arts and Sciences deans.
Information about graduate schools can also be found from a variety of sources, including books that profile graduate schools, prospectus materials from the schools themselves, and web sites.
Grad School Catalogs Online
NOTE: you must be on the BC campus or logged onto the Internet through BC to use this system.
The World-Wide Graduate School Directory is an excellent starting point for graduate school information on the Internet covering over 23,000 graduate programs around the world. Peterson's Education Center also contains information on graduate school and other topics, including Careers and Jobs, Financial Aid, and Testing.
The H-Grad Home Page offers a discussion forum for graduate students as well as a comprehensive listing of graduate school links by topic. Browsing this page can help convey what graduate school is really like by reading about it from the perspective of graduate students themselves.
Admissions
There is no "right" age or length of work experience necessary for applying to an graduate arts and sciences program. Incoming students range in age from 22 to 42. Many graduate students have just completed their undergraduate work. Some take a year off to travel or perform volunteer work before re-entering the academic world. Others work for several years in a variety of career fields before deciding to pursue graduate studies.
Graduate school admissions are based on five basic criteria:
- Undergraduate GPA
- GRE scores
- Recommendations
- Personal Statement
- Work experience and/or prior research projects
Experience is not limited to work history, but also includes relevant personal life experiences, travels, volunteer work, and hobbies. These experiences should be reflected in the personal statement and recommendations.
GPA and GRE scores are important, but experiences outside the classroom also count. Remember that you must convince an admissions committee that your abilities and experiences will make you a valuable addition to that program.
For general information about applying to graduate schools, check out Getting In: An Applicant's Guide to Graduate School Admissions by David Burrell. It is a helpful guide written by a former Kaplan tutor who successfully completed the graduate school application process.
The GRE
The Graduate Record Exam (GRE) is required by most graduate schools. It is a standardized test, similar to the SAT, with two parts: the General Test and the Subject Test.
The General Test includes a variety of multiple choice questions to test verbal, mathematical, and analytical abilities.
The General Test is now administered on computer terminals at test centers throughout North America and can be taken by appointment on any one of several days each month.
The Subject Test is a section with specific questions in an academic discipline. You choose which Subject Test you wish to take, based on the field of graduate study you intend to pursue. Subject Tests are available in the following disciplines:
- Biochemistry: Cell and Molecular Biology
- Biology
- Chemistry
- Computer Science
- Literature in English
- Mathematics
- Physics
- Psychology
The Subject Tests are administered as paper-based tests only. About half of the Subject Tests are offered on a predetermined date in November; all Subject Tests are offered on fixed dates in December and April. More information on the GRE is available from GRE Online, the official website of the Graduate Record Examinations.
Several test-preparation resources are available. Many different books are published annually with GRE practice questions and test-taking strategies, and are available at any bookstore. It is recommended that you use one of these books to aid you in your preparation. If you find yourself needing further GRE preparation, you may elect to enroll in a course offered by one of several test prep companies. These courses can often cost several hundred dollars, so gauge your progress and preparation needs carefully before choosing a prep course.
While Boston College does not endorse any particular GRE prep course, two well-known test prep companies with content-rich websites are The Princeton Review and Kaplan.
Also see our Test Prep Resources page.
Recommendations
Ask people who know you and your abilities well. If you did outstanding work in class for a professor, or if you undertook a significant research project or thesis with a faculty member, these people are in the best position to write compelling letters of recommendation for you. Generally, graduate schools are looking for recommendations from people who can describe your interests and abilities,; graduate schools prefer to see "blind" recommendations because they feel that blind recommendations can offer a more honest assessment of a person's abilities.
Provide the recommendation writers with some background materials, such as a resume and a copy of your personal statement. These materials can help the writers tailor the recommendations to complement the rest of your application package. For example, if you discuss in an essay a research project of which you are particularly proud, you will want to be sure your professor includes a reference to that project in a recommendation. This background material, including your reasons for applying and your career goals, helps recommendation writers focus on your specific strengths, accomplishments, and interests.
College faculty are pressed for time to complete recommendations along with their regular workload, and would welcome your help. In fact, do not be surprised if a faculty member were to tell you, "Draft a recommendation letter for me, and I will make a few changes and sign it for you." In this instance, use the supplemental material yourself to craft a letter which your recommendation writer can then modify as necessary. Linda Abraham's website Accepted.com offers sound advice for recommendation writing, whether the letters are prepared by you or someone else.
The Personal Statement
Most graduate school applications have a generally worded question asking for a personal statement on a topic of your choosing. This statement may include your reasons for choosing the graduate school and/or field you are pursuing, some related accomplishments in academics or other extracurricular activities, or something unique about you that may not be covered elsewhere in your application. As a rule, this personal statement should be about two typed, double spaced pages in length.
When writing the personal statement, be yourself. Show, rather than tell, what you can offer and why you are a compelling candidate for admission. Find your "voice" and write honestly without forcing a particular style or tone. The most compelling essays have a ring of authenticity to them, whether they are serious, funny, sad, or some combination of the three. Write from personal experience, and write honestly. Review your personal statement carefully and proofread the essay for proper syntax, grammar, and spelling.
Linda Abraham's page Accepted.com contains helpful suggestions for writing graduate school application essays.
Timetable of Key Events
When to Request Applications: Try to get them as soon as they are available, usually late summer/early fall.
When to Take The GRE: Since the GRE is now offered on computer terminals at testing centers every month, there is more flexibility for taking the test. Try scheduling the GRE in the spring; ideally, you could take the paper-based General Test and your chosen Subject Test on the same day at the April administration. If you think you did not do well on the General Test, you can cancel the scoring immediately after the test and take it again. Since official reports arrive at the schools four to six weeks after the test, November is generally the last opportunity to take the General Test and still be sure the schools receive the scores before the first application deadline. Schedule the GRE early because popular days and times book quickly. It is best to take the GRE Personal Statement: Start thinking about the personal statement as soon as you know you will be applying to graduate school. Give yourself plenty of time to brainstorm for ideas, and polish the essays. Try to finish the personal statement
- Visit the schools that interest you, if possible.
- Develop an appropriate mix of schools to which you will apply. Select one or two "reach" schools, two or three schools at which your admissions chances are competitive, and one or two schools at which your admissions chances are likely.

Thor: Reviewed In Limerick
A superhero straight from down under?
From Summer Bay to play the God of Thunder,
But he can’t use his hammer,
To nail Nat Portman’s glamour,
Can Avengers live to the hype? I wonder.
Rating: 3.5/5
I’m a bit late with this one, and I know that three other reviewers have already covered Thor but after all the crap that I’ve seen, I wanted to review a movie that I genuinely liked.
Thor is the latest Marvel comic adaptation, and one of the few remaining back-stories in the lead up to the super superhero-group, The Avengers (with Captain America soon to follow).
It tells the story of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and heir to the throne of mystical land Asgard. After a selfish act risks the safety of his realm, Thor is banished to Earth without his power or treasured weapon Mjolnir (pronounced myol-neer). On Earth, he befriends a team of scientists (including Natalie Portman) and learns the value of selflessness, love and blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile, back at Asgard, things begin to fall apart, with Thor’s brother Loki is causing mischief and threatening to destroy the balance of peace created by their father.
As the God of Thunder, I was curious as to how Marvel were going to tackle the ‘fantasy’ aspect of his back-story, while making it possible to relate to the science-based logic behind Iron Man and The Hulk. Luckily, the script balances it out perfectly.
Director Kenneth Branagh tackles the matter head-on, making an effort to explain the link between science and magic, instead of brushing over it in the hope that it would explain itself later on in the franchise.
The best thing about Thor (in geek terms anyway) was that it made multiple references to other characters within the Marvel Universe and sets up the story for The Avengers, due in 2012.
Most notably, The Hurt Locker’s Jeremy Renner makes his debut as the marksman Clint Barton, a.k.a Hawkeye. While I haven’t heard any plans to develop a spin-off movie for his character, it is interesting that they have him working with S.H.I.E.L.D already (similar to his comic-book love interest Black Widow).
Throughout the film, Stellan Skarsgard’s scientist also speaks about an old-friend who experimented with Gamma Rays and was taken by S.H.I.E.L.D – of course referring to Bruce Banner (The Hulk), and when agents are confronted by a massive, fire-breathing robot, they immediately suspect the involvement of Tony Stark (Iron Man).
The biggest revelation comes long after the credits roll. For those of you who are willing to sit until the end, will get potential clue as to the story behind The Avengers movie. I won’t give it away here, but it basically reveals who the villain is likely to be, and features Samuel Jackson as S.H.I.E.L.D coordinator Nick Fury.
Chris Hemsworth is awesome and carries himself well as a God amongst men, without being too outrageous or conceded. The Aussie accent actually made all the difference in that respect, as an American forcing the same dialogue would have been off-putting.
The support cast here is amazing, with Hopkins playing the admirable king who reveals moments of weakness, and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, who establishes his own motives but is later confronted by new information that influences his decisions.
Natalie Portman just keeps getting hotter and cooler (bit of a contradiction), which makes it perfectly believable that even a God would fall for her. I also thought it was good that Kat Dennings provided most of the comic relief, in a part which is usually handed to nerdy-looking males like Justin Long. I can’t believe Rene Russo went for such a small role, as it was basically a nothing-part (unless it’s a role that carries on with the franchise).
It seems that Marvel Studios is yet to stumble since they started producing their own movies. While failures like Daredevil, Elektra, The Punisher, Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider were helmed by other studios, Marvel has built a credible resume, including both Iron Man films, the reboot of The Incredible Hulk (not that incredible), Thor and the upcoming Captain America.
To be honest, I can’t wait to see how it all comes together with The Avengers. I guess we’ll have to wait an see.

Top 5 Myth-Busted Beauty Tips
Myth 1: Rubbing lemon on your teeth makes them whiter without damaging them.
FALSE. The citric acid from lemons will make them whiter, but it also wears away the enamel. Don’t make this a habit!
Myth 2: Special shampoos can fix split ends.
FALSE. Special shampoos that rehydrate your hair will only work to prevent damage after you cut your split ends off.
Myth 3: Sunscreen is unnecessary on a cloudy day.
FALSE. Clouds are just made of water droplets. And just like you wouldn’t forget sunscreen coverage for playing in the pool, neither should you for an overcast day. UV rays are the problem-causing light frequency and can easily penetrate any amount of cloud cover. Cover up!
FALSE. As long as you don’t overdo it, chocolate is part of a healthy diet. Diet plays a very distinct role in skin problems. The best way to promote a healthy complexion is to eat a diet rich with anti-oxidants, nutrients, Vitamin E and simple carbohydrates.
Myth 5: Wearing acrylic nails too often will destroy your real nails.
FALSE. They actually do a pretty good job of protecting your real nails. However, you can certainly do damage to your real nails if you try to get acrylic nails off improperly, like picking them off piece by piece. Treat your acrylic nails with the same respect you give your real nails, and everything will be fine.
Got any more beauty tips passed to you that turned out to be bunk? Let us know about them!

Good stuff! I’ve tried to tell people about the lemon juice before. Never heard of the split end shampoo but that’s interesting.

We (our family) have a member that has chosen beauty school. When a student is
working on customers at the school. Does the student get any of the fee that the customer pays for the students’ services, or, does the school keep all the money and the student has to hope for a tip.

Hi Evia! This is a great question! Though it can vary from school to school, students typically do not get paid when working in the school’s student salon. They are there for experience working with real clients, and the prices are very nominal anyway, so the school keeps the money. And yes, sometimes students get tips!

I shall leave you with this final note, that which echoes the words of the great Nietzsche: To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. Please accept this so-called 'Luv' as a shallow token of my enduring appreciation. Signed, Online Blogger.
To my long time friend Mr David Doherty. Mere words cannot possibly profess the magnitude of feeling I would expect to experience upon recognition of your enduring care, concern and compassion for me. Unfortunately, as I am sure you have deduced from your apparent above-average intellectuality, I am void of emotions bearing positivity. I am bereft, my dear friend, of beatitude and thus cannot claim to comprehend the weight behind your kind words. Forgive me, David, for you know that such emotions are beyond me. I do, however, possess the aptitude for gratitude, (do you take kindly to my use of rhyme - I developed it in isolation and assure you that it was a mere fluke) though I have little cause to do so as life has dealt me the cruelest of hands and henceforth, I appear to digress. Once more, forgive me, David, for I would never wish to burden you.

Ghost Face Killah
February 9, 2012 in ale, beer, Boulder, brewery, chile beer, chili, colorado, craft beer, hops, twisted pine
I like beer. Hoppy beer, dark beer and even…hot beer! I recently tried the Ghost Face Killah from Twisted Pine Brewery in Boulder, Colo.
I’ve heard rumors about this beer; it’ll burn all the way down, you may not survive the first sip, and for most, that may be true. Gost Face Killah is brewed with 6 peppers (some may call crazy hot!): Anaheim, Fresno, Jalapeno, Serrano, Habanero and Bhut Jolokia – aka Ghost Pepper. The Ghost Pepper punches 200 times the heat of jalapenos, sitting at over 1 millions Scoville units (Jalapenos, Anaheim and Poblano between 3,500-8,000 and Serrano’s at 10,000-23,000, you get the picture!). The Guinness World Records certified the Ghost chili as the hottest peppers in the
world. The brewers even had to wear masks and gloves to cut them up! Yikes!
You think I’m hyping the beer up? Go ahead, try it yourself, I dare ya! I’m a Southwestern girl, and I can burn my face-off with chili’s, hot sauce and go for more, I’m not going to lie, Ghost Face is a Killah! Upon my first sip, I was really anticipating the chili pepper taste to be as strong as its aroma. It has a nice, light wheat flavor, then the temperature rises and the heat kicks in. It’s burn lasts throughout your mouth and the back of your throat. How’s the finish? HOT! Although, it’s a well balanced beer. Truly, if you dig chili-style beer, as I do, and can handle heat, you’ll enjoy all 12 ounces of it.
This beer is seasonally available in CO, NE, NM, FL, MO, TX and LA.

The bilberries are ripe on the top of Cavehill — and this evening you can join the harvest.
The Belfast Hills Partnership has organised a walk to the top of the hill to eat these delicious wild berries that have been ripening all summer despite the rain.
The walk takes place at Cavehill Country Park's Upper Hightown Road car park from 7-9pm.
Participants are asked to wrap up warm, wear sturdy walking boots and bring drinking water. Price £1 for adults. Children go free. Not suitable for very small children due to the walk which can be steep in places.

Wales wing wizard Shane Williams has only a "50-50" chance of being fit to weave his magic against England tomorrow.
That will be music to the ears of England boss Martin Johnson, whose under-performing squad arrived in Cardiff today for the RBS 6 Nations showdown.
Williams is battling to recover from an ankle injury suffered during Wales’ tournament-opening victory over Scotland last weekend.
Wales head coach Warren Gatland hopes to make just one change from that successful Murrayfield mission, having recalled fit-again captain Ryan Jones instead of blindside flanker Dafydd Jones.
But Scarlets wing Mark Jones, who has not played since undergoing appendix surgery last month, is on full alert to replace Williams, while Dafydd Jones could rapidly reappear off the replacements’ bench if number eight Andy Powell is sidelined by a calf muscle strain.
Powell pulled up in training yesterday, although fears about his prospects are considerably less than those for current world player of the year Williams.
Gatland said: "We have given Shane until (today) because he’s a bit of a talisman for us.
"I think he had 20-odd touches against Scotland last weekend, which for a wing is pretty exceptional. He is the biggest concern - he’s probably 50-50. Andy is probably 90-10 in favour of being fit. It’s just a tightness of the calf, and hopefully it will ease up for tomorrow’s captain’s run."
Mark Jones, despite a chronic shortage of rugby since Christmas, will be promoted from outside the match-day 22 to win his 44th cap if Williams is ruled out.
Williams has scored a Welsh record 45 tries in 62 Tests and was last season’s leading Six Nations finisher.
Wales are chasing a hat-trick of Six Nations wins against England for the first time, but their fearsome attacking edge would be blunted to a degree without the mesmeric Ospreys star.
Gatland, who did not consider centre Gavin Henson due to his ongoing recovery from a calf muscle problem, accepts England are currently "quite hard to read".
After a dismal autumn series that produced comprehensive defeats against South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, England at least launched their Six Nations campaign by scoring five tries to beat Italy, even if it proved a painfully laboured display.
Wales have been installed as red-hot favourites to dispatch England at the Millennium Stadium, making it two wins out of two before tackling France in Paris later this month. Gatland though is well aware about the dangers of people writing England off.
"How many times has it happened in the past where people have rocked up to see a Welsh team expecting to win, and they’ve gone away disappointed?" he said.
"If we play to our potential, we’ve got a good chance of winning, but there are two teams involved here.
One team is smarting from a lot of criticism of recent performances and a lot of criticism of the coaching set-up and stuff.
"I think they will come out really looking to put us under pressure.
"Their backs are to the wall, and if they come away from there, then not just us, but everyone, will get the old two fingers up and they can jump on the bus and go away pretty satisfied."

Flash Mobile Application Development For Dummies
Jodie O'Rourke's
Flash Mobile Application Development For Dummies
is the first book to supply needed information, not easily found on the web or in other books, about developing apps for Android and iOS .
For the last eight months, I've been researching how to create a storybook app in Flash
R
Professional. I have purchased many books about Flash and AIR
R
but they all seem to give the same information, falling short of supplying the critical information needed to create a performance optimized app in Flash Professional. I was able to find a little information on the Adobe
R
site and a few blogs, but nothing that completely covered this important topic.
Also, most of the Flash-related mobile development books available concentrate on using Flash Builder
R
to develop mobile apps and only touch on Flash Professional. This was very frustrating due to the high visual nature of a storybook application and Flash Builder's limitations in this area. Flash Professional is the best choice for apps that rely heavily on illustration, animation and user interaction.
Jodie O'Rourke's book, released a few days ago, not only concentrates on Flash Professional as the development environment but covers the advanced topics that will help you to optimize your application's performance. You will enjoy Jodie O'Rourke's subtle humor throughout the book as she discusses some very complicated topics in non-technical language with simple step-by-step instructions.
As you would expect, being a
For Dummies
book, the author starts with the basic topics from mobile-related terminology and what makes a good app to an introduction to the Flash Professional tools and workspace. Covering both the Android
R
and iOS
R
platforms, the sample project that you develop throughout the book is an arcade game called SpaceShipZapZap. You can try the game for free from the app stores and also download the source code from the Dummies website. As you build the app, the author shares her experience in app development and discusses how to avoid common pitfalls with good development decisions.
You begin by building a start screen for the game, using the Flash drawing tools. The author explains how she creates filter effects, such as drop shadows, without using those CPU hungry filters and how ActionScript code, such as bottlenecks, can become CPU problematic and how to avoid them in your code.
You use ActionScript to initialize the app and to create your alien fleet. But you can't have a game if the fleet just sits there. O'Rourke teaches animation basics from frame-by-frame animation and tweening to coding your animations with ActionScript and collision detection. She discusses how to create interaction, such as drag and drop, using event listeners and how to avoid performance problems such as event bubbling. She also explains how garbage collection works and discusses other performance aids such as using device fonts, object pooling and bitmap caching.
Of course, she also covers incorporating mobile features into your app, such as geolocation, SMS, calls, maps, multi-touch gestures and the accelerometer. She discusses the development considerations when using embedded audio/video versus the various ways to stream over the internet. She also covers how to collect user information with forms and the mobile keyboard and your storage/retrieval options.
Now that you have built the perfect app, you need to test it on a target device using the Flash testing tools and WiFi. She also covers how to test your app in Device Central and Flash Builder and discusses how to set up your app for Ad Hoc testing with multiple testers. Finally, she covers what is needed to submit your app to both the Android and iOS app store.
Although this book concentrates on Flash Professional, the author includes a chapter on creating and testing an RSS reader app in Flash Builder. The Part of Tens section includes tips on performance optimization, pleasing the app user and app store success.
Jodie O'Rourke is an Adobe Certified Flash and Flex Platform Expert and Adobe Community Professional specializing in Flash, Flex and AIR development.

The oil is made from a wild Rose (Rosa Affines Rubiginosa) that grows high up in the Chilean Andes. South American women have been using the oil for centuries for its rejuvenating and anti-aging skin properties. Rio Rosa Mosqueta Oil is made from oil extracted from the Rose Hips collected from the wild Roses.
The oil is cold pressed to preserve the Essential Fatty Acids. The Rose Hip oil contains more Gamma Linoleic Acid than Evening Primrose oil, Borage oil or Blackcurrant Seed oil. Omega 3 & 6 and a natural form of vitamin A (Trans-Retinoic Acid) are also found in this Rose Hip oil.
The Rose Hip oil is a pale yellow colour. It has no particular odour and it leaves no greasy residue on the skin. Just a small amount is needed to leave the skin feeling soft and hydrated.
I tried this product because the skin creams I had been using were causing irritation of my skin. Everything I tried felt sticky or slimy and my skin would itch and become very dry. Some products caused rashes on my face. So I started looking for natural products with no added chemicals and I came across the Rio Rosa Mosqueta Oil website.
Rio Rosa Mosqueta Oil
The oil is one hundred per cent natural and lays claims to dramatically reducing all visible scars, stretch marks, sun damaged skin and helps reduce the signs of aging. This is too good to be true I thought to myself but I purchased my first bottle none the less.
I have use the oil on my face, neck and hands nearly every day for three months. The first thing I noticed was a change in the texture of my skin, it felt like velvet. After a few weeks of using the oil I noticed that the small brown patches I had on my cheeks were beginning to fade, as were similar patches on the backs of my hands. After three months they have almost disappeared.
I have several small scars on my body as a result of operations and accidents so I thought I would try the oil on these. One particular scar on my leg has definitely faded.
As for the anti-aging claim, I have had comments that my face looks fresher but my frown line is still frowning at me. The tiny lines around my lips and eyes are less noticeable and a male friend commented that I looked the best he had seen me for a long while!
I have requested and received a free sample of the new Rio Rosa Mosqueta Day and Night Cream to try. I was expecting a sachet but the Rio Rosa team sent me a whole pot. It is made of the same frosted glass with the pink embellished logo and contains 50ml of thick, organic, pale yellow cream which has a very slight nutty aroma that fades once applied.
Since applying it my skin feels deliciously soft. I had thought while using the oil that sometimes I just wanted to slap a huge dollop of cream on my face to rehydrate it and this cream does the trick. It is luscious and non-greasy and my face feels supple and hydrated.
Rio Rosa Mosqueta Cream is made from natural essential oils and organic ingredients. It is conserved with Salicylic Acid and Sodium Benzoate.
Rio Rosa Mosqueta Cream
I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to use natural, organic ingredients in their skin care routine. I am never going back to artificial, chemical ridden potions that cost a fortune and do not do what it says on the jar.
Well done Rio Rosa Mosqueta Oil, I think it lives up to its claims and I intend to continue to purchase these Rose Hip oil products.

A Girl Like Che Guevara shows the hierarchy of being a teenager from a Cuban perspective. The author, Teresa de la Caridad Doval, calls her book, "A little dirty piece of life in Cuba." She's right. At one point I thought the camp should be called Sex-in-the-fields. There's a lot of abuse, via bullying and food rations to go along with the dirt. Like the dirt Lourdes describes while she stitches away her days in the sewing shacks: "a film of dust covered our lips while our stomachs growled with repressed hunger."
Lourdes' job involves sewing the tobacco leaves onto dried sticks. This was considered the women's work while the boys worked in groups picking the leaves and finding the perfect sticks. Hundreds of students were supervised by a few teachers, some reliable and some not so reliable.
The night before leaving for camp Lourdes cuddles her little Russian dolls and wishes she didn't have to go, that she "could preserve for a little longer the rosy illusions of childhood." The transition from child to young woman is not a new theme but to read about it in the confines of post revolution Cuba is. Cuba has suffered a rich history of upheaval and to witness the growth of a little girl into a woman during the harshness of this back drop is endearing and educational. I really had no background on Cuba, Che Guevara or tobacco fields. It was an eye opener. Teresa handles it beautifully, with respect and without attempting to deliver a history lesson. I was lost on some of the political references but it didn't take away from the story.
Racial politics is everywhere. Lourdes came from a mulatto (mixed) mother and a white father. She considers herself "plain, too white to be a genuine black, too dark to be a true white," and fantasizes about being as white as the women in the Russian magazines she reads. Other strong themes are family, loss, friendship, religion, culture and community, as well as sexuality. Homosexuality is frowned upon by the communist party but Lourdes suddenly finds herself in love and yearning for her bed buddy.
I was annoyed by the continued "Fat" Olga descriptions after the initial introduction. Fat Olga this, Fat Olga that. There was more to Olga than being fat. Sometimes I stumbled on the mingled Spanish and English but mostly I enjoyed Teresa's visions, like the contrast of evenings and nights, work and play: "Eternity was no longer an abstract concept for us. The evenings were long carpets of apathy which had to be trod under the lethargic surveillance of wearied teachers. But at night the rhythm changed. Hours flew. Minutes became nanoseconds."
This is an entertaining story and a look into an interesting culture, often ignored. I recommend reading it.

After being the smallest school in Class 2A, in terms of enrollment, for the past two years and one of the smallest for the past six, just about everybody in the city of Blaine - or at least the Blaine High School athletic department - welcomed a move down to Class 1A during the latest reclassification cycle this year.
Everybody, that is, except runner Tom Bradley.
"It's kind of a bummer to lose the competition with the guys we've been running with the past four years," Bradley said in a phone interview. "We won't get a chance to race against those 2A guys that we've built rivalries with over the years. I wanted a little redemption for those guys beating me last year."
By "those guys" Bradley was specifically talking about Sehome seniors Conner Johnsen and Reed Henderson and defending 2A state champion Patrick Gibson.
"Tom loves racing the best," Blaine cross country coach Carey Bacon said. "It's what drives him. He feels he races his best when he's racing the best."
But don't worry too much about Bradley getting lonely in the 1A ranks.
He's still got old rival Dillon Quintana from Mount Baker hot on his heels, and the two of them turned in a another classic battle on Saturday, Oct. 27, at the Class 1A Tri-District Meet in Tacoma - a race Bradley won by just 5 seconds.
"It's great having Dillon down here," Bradley said. "He's great competition. He'll keep me from slacking off."
Not that Bradley is the type to slack off - in fact, he's exactly the opposite.
"Tom is getting everything he deserves," Bacon said. "He's earned it all. He's done an enormous amount of work. If you look over his entire high school career, he's invested a lot of time and sweat equity. It's exciting to see it coming around for him."
In addition to winning last week's tri-district title in 16 minutes, 2.1 seconds, Bradley won the Northwest Conference Championship crown in 15:21.93 - a time that still stands as the best at 5 kilometers in the state.
Not only that, Bradley got the pleasure of beating out Gibson in their final high school cross country race together, along with all the other seniors he's grown up racing against.
"That was really neat," Bradley said. "I love running against Patrick and those guys. I think it was good to show how good the 1As are going to be this year, and it's always good to get the last one. Patrick is an amazing competitor, and I think he had the course record, and I broke that, too. To end my high school conference career with a win and a new record, it made me extremely happy."
Perhaps not quite as happy as he was to help Blaine qualify its first team for state last week.
Besides running the top time in the tri-district, Bradley had a huge hand in recruiting enough talented runners - many from Blaine's soccer team - to help the Borderites get through to state with a fifth-place finish.
"This year, we've put so much emphasis on the team," Bradley said. "Dropping down to 1A, we knew we would have a chance. 2A is just so competitive in this district, especially with only three teams going through. I think they had six teams ranked in the top 10 in the state. That's just crazy. This last year, I've been recruiting a lot of my friends, too. For my senior project, I held summer practices and helped coach those guys through the summer and get them some mileage."
While Bradley was focusing on increasing the mileage of his teammates to get them ready, the senior that has long been known for running miles and miles each week during the summer, found different ways to prepare for the season - mainly improving his strength in the weight room.
"This year, I've been lifting weights for the first time," Bradley said. "We're starting to do a lot more drills and lifting stuff. It's something I hadn't done before, and it's made a giant difference. Before this year, I was just increasing my mileage, which increases my chances of injury."
Combine Bradley's improved strength with his hard work and determination and add in his race smarts, and it's no wonder Bradley has to be considered one of the favorites to claim the 1A individual title this year.
"His sense of race pace is really, really good," Bacon said. "He knows how fast he is going. His internal clock, in terms of time, is really good. Now that he's stronger, he's not afraid to get out front and push the pace. ... All year long, Tom has been near the front, if he's not leading. That takes mental toughness to do, because you don't want to push it too hard too early. But Tom knows exactly what he's doing."
Bradley is looking forward to making up for what he described as a "difficult" 2A state meet last year, when he finished 47th with a time of 16:51.
If he can, he would like to show that he is capable of doing the same thing Gibson did last year and bring home an individual state title.
"I was looking at that recently," Bradley said. "It's pretty exciting. All of us have a great shot at doing something big. Me individually, Patrick individually and with his team. Those Sehome guys seem to be in great shape for a team title. It could be a really big day for Whatcom County."

Bemidji HS boys basketball team opens with Green Wave
The Bemidji High boys basketball team makes its season debut tonight, hosting East Grand Forks at 7:30 at the Field House.
The preliminaries begin at 5:45 with the freshman game in the Auxiliary gym and the B Team contest in the main gymnasium.
Bemidji shoots for another winning season this winter after going 16-10 in 2009.
That was the first year above the .500 mark since an identical finish in 2005.
Last year Bemidji put a blue collar team on the court that won through hard work and hustle much of the season.
Jeff Brown begins his eighth season at the helm with a guarded air of confidence.
"We're going to have to play end to end this year to win, play fast break basketball, guard full court and hope for numerous buckets in transition."
To do this, however, will depend on controlling the defensive boards.
And that could cause problems.
Much will depend on the play of senior Grant Richardson, the 6-5 football tackle who played on the JV last winter.
That team ended 15-9 under Steve Thompson.
Only three lettermen are back from 2009, seniors Czar Woods (9.9) and Dan Frost (1.9) and junior scoring leader Ryan Rude (13.4).
Rude was the team's Co-MVP and Woods the defensive MVP lat winter.
Three seniors move up from the JV to challenge for varsity roles, 6-2 forward Josh Kane and 6-1 guard Derres Martell, each in their sixth year in the program, and 6-11 Frank Mays, who took up the sport last winter for the first time and showed promise in limited playing time in 2009. His size could prove a major help if he develops.
Sophomore Carey Woods was the B Team's scoring leader last winter and is likely to be again at the varsity level this year
Other regulars from the B Team are Mitch Brown, Zach DeClusin and Cody Rutledge, Brown and Rutledge only sophs.
Juniors from that team moving up include Harley Kroening, and Ben Hengel.
Starters tonight will be Richardson at center flanked by Rude and Frost on the baseline with the Woods brothers outside with Kroening, Kane, Rutledge and Brown the top reserves.
The Jacks drop to Section 8-3A this year for the first time where their major foes will include Little Falls, Apollo, Sauk Rapids and Rocori along with Thief River and Detroit Lakes.
A complete team preview appeared in yesterday's Winter Sports tab.

Deer River woman pleads guilty to stealing vehicle titles, fees
A 51-year-old Deer River woman pleaded guilty Monday to theft of more than $100,000 in public funds.
Sheila Marie Jerry entered the plea in Itasca County District Court and paid $112,734 in restitution. She will be sentenced at an April 30 court hearing.
According to the criminal complaint filed in the case, the Deer River clerk/treasure told an investigator that Jerry reported that she had taken thousands of dollars from her till over the course of five years as an employee of the state's Department of Motor Vehicle in Deer River.
Jerry told authorities that she obtained the title work and fees for new vehicles from a car dealer, and kept some of the paperwork and money for some titles.
In addition, Jerry said she had several titles in her vehicle or home. She said she stamped the title paper work but had not stamped the original copies that were later sent to the state, and kept the cash from the title transfers.
Law enforcement later obtained 10 vehicle titles from her vehicle and 63 from her home, and associated fees of more than $99,000, for vehicles sold between last March 31 and Sept. 29.

Election Notebook: Court challengers face uphill climb
ST. PAUL — Challengers to Minnesota Supreme Court justices say their job is tough.
Obstacles challengers point out include restrictions on collecting donations, making campaigns tough to fund against better-known incumbents. Also, the would-be justices say that just already being in office carries several advantages, including “incumbent” printed by their names on the ballot and an easier time raising money as a sitting justice.
“It has been 66 years since an incumbent judge has lost an election,” said Dean Barkley, who has lost races for Congress in the Independence Party and is making his first bid at judicial office against Justice Barry Anderson.
Challengers in all three races say the current system is stacked in favor of incumbents. In most cases, judges and justices retire in the middle of their terms. That leaves it up to the governor to appoint replacements, who as sitting judges may have an advantage when they come up for election.
Chief Justice Lorie S. Gildea and Justice Barry Anderson have run before, while Justice David Stras, in office just two years, is in his first campaign.
Stras probably speaks for all the candidates in saying: “I feel like I am working two jobs.”
Tim Tingelstad pointed to a problem he has in working from his Bemidji home, as does Gildea opponent Dan Griffith of International Falls: “It’s a long ways down to the population center.”
While Tingelstad said that many northern Minnesotans may know him, others do not.
Another incumbent advantage is support from fellow lawyers. The Minnesota Bar Association surveys members and this year, like usual in the past, the incumbents drew far more support.
Stras and Anderson received 82 percent and 83 percent support, respectively, while Gildea won 93 percent approval.
There is a disagreement about whether being involved with political parties is allowed, or even is a good thing. While a Minnesota case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court opened judicial campaigns up for more political discussion, just how much of that is allowed remains in dispute.
Challengers such as Tingelstad have sought the Republican Party endorsement. The party’s platform calls for judicial endorsements, but none came this year.

GOP blamed in Eken race
The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Friday filed a complaint that the Republican Party broke the law by making false statements about a candidate’s voting record.
The DFL says Republicans distributed campaign literature incorrectly saying Rep. Kent Eken, a Democrat running for the state Senate, voted to raise a fee senior citizens pay for nursing home care.
Democrats called on the Office of Administration Hearings to penalize the GOP for making false statements, which is against state campaign laws.
Republicans distributed a new piece of literature when informed the Eken claim was wrong.
“We goofed,” the literature says. “Kent Eken did not vote to raise the fee seniors pay for nursing home care.”
Then the Republican material goes on to say: “Instead, Eken voted to raise the cost we pay for hospital care and health insurance.”
GOP Executive Director Ben Zierke said the party looked into the vote after Eken disputed the original literature during a debate.
“It was an honest mistake on that vote,” Zierke said, and the party sent the “we goofed” piece out as soon as possible after fact-checking the first piece. “There is no question that he did not vote for the tax.”
Democrats probably would not have known about the mistake if Republicans had not send the follow-up flier, Zierke added. “We owned up to it.”
DFL Chairman Ken Martin said the GOP apology does not fix the earlier law violation.
“Their ads were blatantly false, and we filed a complaint today because these dishonest tactics cannot be allowed to go unchecked,” Martin said Friday. “The attacks against Kent Eken amount to a smear campaign. It’s not even a distortion of the truth, it’s an outright lie.”
Eken is running for Senate in a district around Moorhead and Detroit Lakes against former Buffalo Bills star Phil Hansen, a Republican.
Kriesel in commercial
State Rep. John Kriesel’s dramatic speech in the Minnesota House opposing a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is featured in a television commercial.
The Cottage Grove lawmaker joined Rep. Tim Kelly of Red Wing as the only two Republicans to vote against the amendment, which will be in front of voters Nov. 6. Kriesel is retiring when his term ends in early January.
In the speech, Kriesel recounted when a bomb exploded in Iraq, causing injuries that eventually cost him his legs.
“I was in an incident and I nearly died,” Kriesel said. “I remember laying there, looking down and seeing my legs mangled. I thought about my family.”
He recounted the story of Cpl. Andrew Wilfahrt, a soldier from Rosemount, who was killed in Afghanistan last year.
“He gave his life in Afghanistan protecting our freedoms,” Kriesel said. “He was gay. I cannot look at this picture and say, corporal, you are good enough to fight for your country and give your life, but you are not good enough to marry the person you love.”
After his May 2011 speech, opponents of the amendment greeted Kriesel as a hero when he left the House chambers.
Nov. 6 registration available
Minnesotans who have not registered to vote or updated their addresses, still may do so on election day.
“Minnesotans should use the online voter registration lookup at to see if their registration is current,” Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said. “Voters who are already registered to vote at their address do not need to bring additional documentation with them to their polling place. However, eligible voters who plan to register on Election Day must provide proof of residence.”

Lack of wind strands balloon over St. Croix River
AFTON, Minn. -- Things couldn’t have been more still or calm that Sunday evening above the St. Croix River in Afton – and that’s exactly what raised a commotion.
Dead air in the St. Croix valley caused a hot air balloon loaded with 15 people -- who also remained calm -- to stall directly over the river at 7:50 p.m. Aug. 11.
“The balloons are at the mercy of the wind, and, well, there was no wind,” said Jim Gribble, a sergeant with the Washington County Sheriff’s Office.
When deputies approached the scene with a boat, the balloon was about 5 feet above the water. Officers towed the balloon, owned by Stillwater Balloon, to St. Croix Beach, where all passengers got out safely.

WASHINGTON — victories and losses often are scored based on the overall impressions candidates leave with voters.
In the history books, though, small moments often end up telling the broader story.
Think of 73-year-old Ronald Reagan’s pledge not to exploit his opponent’s youth. Or John McCain’s dismissive reference to Barack Obama as simply “that one."
A look back at some of the best and worst exchanges from presidential debates.
Ronald Reagan
“I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.".’ "
Lloyd Bentsen
“Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy."
George H.W. Bush’s pick for vice president, fresh-faced Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, got multiple questions about his preparedness to assume the office during a 1988 debate.
“I want to take you back to the question that I asked you earlier about what would happen if you were to take over in an emergency, and what you would do first and why," moderator Brit Hume told Quayle. “You said you would say a prayer, and you said something about a meeting. What would you do next?"
“I don’t believe that it’s proper for me to get into the specifics of a hypothetical situation like that," Quayle replied.
Moderator Tom Brokaw later pressed Quay."
“Three times that I’ve had this question," a frustrated Quayle said before teeing up a rehearsed answer.
“I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country. I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency."
Quayle’s Democratic rival, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, pounced: “Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy."
“That was really uncalled for, Senator," replied Quayle.
“You are the one that was making the comparison, Senator," Bentsen shot back. “And I’m one who knew him well."
Bentsen, running mate to Michael Dukakis, scored the win in that debate, but the Democrats nonetheless lost the election to Bush.
John McCain
“That one."
McCain’s campaign was on the ropes when he faced Obama for a second debate in 2008. He had suspended his campaign the previous month to rush back to Washington and address the Wall Street crisis. But he came off as unprepared to handle the economy, suddenly voters’ top concern. Polls showed McCain was slipping behind. And his on-the-ground operations were badly lagging Obama’s.
So when Brokaw asked McCain about government-funded energy innovation, McCain saw his chance to take a detour and paint Obama as a spend-happy Washington insider.
“By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by (President George W. Bush) and (Vice President Dick) Cheney. You know who voted for it? You might never know," McCain said, gesturing to his rival.
“That one."
And that was a turnoff for many voters.
Gerald Ford
“There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe."
During his 1976 debate against Democrat Jimmy Carter, President Ford seemed to ignore the political reach of the Soviet Union, so much so that the debate moderator did a double-take. Republicans and Democrats alike recognized that Eastern Europe was largely under Soviet influence but the United States strongly opposed any efforts that would take the land and put it within their borders.
“There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration," Ford said.
“I?" asked Max Frankel of The New York Times.
Carter, who went on to defeat Ford, challenged the president’s views on Eastern Europe.
“I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country, that those countries do not live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron Curtain," Carter said.
Body Language
Watches, sighs and eye rolls.
Sometimes, the most memorable moments are wordless.
Take the first President Bush in 1992. The incumbent looked down at his watch as a voter asked a question about the struggling economy during a town hall-style debate, suggesting he was bored with the whole thing.
Bush lost his re-election bid to Clinton.
Vice President Al Gore sent an over-the-top message of impatience during his 2000 debate with then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush with a series of loud, overwrought sighs.
Gore also overdid his incredulity toward some of Bush’s claims during their first debate.
The vice president rolled his eyes, a move that his staff — and America — instantly recognized as problematic. Before the next debate, Gore’s aides made him watch a “Saturday Night Live" skit mocking his performance.
Course correction was not enough. Gore lost to Bush.

The Ohlone Dog Park sits atop the BART tracks along Hearst Street at Grant. It is about an acre of land fenced off to allow a free run for Berkeley’s canine community. Dog owners – sorry, guardians – get to sit in the park and chat while the pooches run and play and sniff and scratch. Some run and play; others sniff and scratch. This is a putative city-run facility but the users do most of the clean-up and maintenance.
Needless to say, the City has no money for proper seating at the Ohlone Dog Park. There are a couple aging picnic benches with attached seating. When one approached total disintegration due to age and exposure to the weather, one of the regular park users, not the City, provided a new one.
There was still too little seating, but occasionally someone would drop off an old patio chair and, after a while, some eight or ten chairs accumulated. Seeking a more permanent solution, the Ohlone Dog Park Association, an organization of a couple dozen park regulars, recently bought ten sturdy metal chairs for the park. With little help, but no interference from the City, the seating problem at the park was addressed over time by the users themselves — at least until recently.
A few weeks ago, Parks Superintendent Susan Ferrera informed the Association that loose chairs were not allowed and had to go. Under threat of forced confiscation of the chairs by the City, the Association removed the metal chairs. The City apparently confiscated the remaining plastic chairs as they too are now gone.
Sympathetic to the problem, Ms. Ferrera e-mailed that a design process to begin in the fall would address the seating issue. Now literally left standing, the park users will likely have to wait a year to sit down again. At that time, the City will provide some undetermined quantity of seating, firmly anchored to the ground because, supposedly, it is safer that way.
I have lived in Berkeley for almost 50 years and have frequented the Ohlone Dog Park regularly since getting a dog about four years ago. I have seen some pretty silly stuff in Berkeley over the years, but the removal of chairs from the dog park is way up there on the list. The park users are perfectly capable of individually making a decision, without the guidance of City bureaucrats, as to which outdoor furniture they feel provides a reasonable level of personal safety. They do not need or desire City guidance in this matter.. The supposed greater liability is presumptive and the risk assumable at little or no cost.
This silliness is the nanny-state at its worst. The City cannot, or will not, provide chairs at a park where people routinely spend an hour or more and, when the park users dealt with this dearth of seating by buying their own, the all-knowing, all wise bureaucrats literally confiscated the seating leaving park users, many old and some infirm, literally standing around.
The park without chairs is about half as useful as with them. The insufficient seating which remains cannot be oriented to gain or avoid direct sunlight; users cannot join a group discussion by pulling up a chair; nor can one isolate oneself away from others to read a book without distraction.
All the users of the park seemed quite happy with things as they were. I, for one, wish the City of Berkeley would expend their nanny-state energies somewhere else. We do not need their help and guidance in this situation..

The lone person in the apartment at the time and two cats escaped unharmed.
Czerwinski said firefighters quickly knocked down the fire, which was confined to the apartment. The unit sustained smoke, water and fire damage.

At some point falling apart must be seen as giving up and that appears to be what Coakley and the Democrats are doing. Despite the election being tomorrow, this was the scene at a Coakley phone bank.
Video embedded below.
"across the street at the Massachusetts Teachers Association,."
No such stories were reported for Brown's phone banks. Indeed the opposite has been reported (see following the poll graphic).
Even Chris Matthews (MSNBC) appears resigned to a Coakley (D) loss and a Brown (R) win and acknowledges that it is a vote against the healthcare overhaul.
Video embedded below.
This graph shows just how far the election has swung.

Regarding Brown's phone banks;
"The MTA phone banks are not in the heavy snow area. Out here in Littleton we got about 8 to 10 inches of heavy wet snow. ALL phones have been manned all morning in the Scott Brown, Littleton office on Stevens St.."

»  Fourteen: Final Exam, Last Dive and a Happy BirthdayThe day started with a hardy breakfast and the final exam (the breakfast was good and hopefully so was the exam). After two fun-filled hours of writing, everyone headed out for the last dive of the trip. It was a spectacular drift dive with lots to see. The afternoon was spent preparing for the evening presentations, which went very well. Then it was off to dinner, filet mignon again (oh well, someone has to eat it). After dinner we celebrated Kristin’s birthday and then everyone headed off to pack for our early morning departure.

"What is climate? Climate is commonly thought of as the expected weather conditions at a given location over time. People know when they go to New York City in winter, they should take a heavy coat. When they visit the Pacific Northwest, they should take an umbrella. Climate can be measured as many geographic scales - for example, cities, countries, or the entire globe - by such statistics as average temperatures, average number of rainy days, and the frequency of droughts. Climate change refers to changes in these statistics over years, decades, or even centuries. Enormous progress has been made in increasing our understanding of climate change and its causes, and a clearer picture of current and future impacts is emerging. Research is also shedding light on actions that might be taken."

BBS Rescue Spotlight: The Mia Foundation
BestBullySticks.com had the great opportunity to speak with Sue Rogers, founder of The Mia Foundation. This great organization helps pets with birth defects that no one else will take. Read on to learn about the inspiring Mia the Chihuahua and more amazing pet rescues.
When & Why did you start?
The Mia Foundation was established in April of 2012 after the death of our precious Chihuahua, Mia. This is her story.
My precious Mia was born with a cleft palate. Mia had several surgeries, (all of which had failed.) Although she was taken to the top Universities and to the top Veterinarians, she was given little hope of survival. I was told that euthanasia was best. I refused to give up on her and vowed to fight for her as long as she continued to fight. She was given a chance at life and even though her life was short-lived, she lived it to the fullest. She had to face many medical obstacles on her journey here, but she never let it overpower her love for life. Mia has inspired over 11,000 people from all over the world and continues to create Miracles every day.
Sadly, Mia passed away from pneumonia on April 11th, 2012 two months shy of her 2nd birthday. Her legacy lives on through The Mia Foundation which was created in her honor.
The Mia Foundation was developed to give animals born with birth defects a fighting chance. Mia was given a chance and in return gave so much love, hope and inspiration to people all around the world. I have come to realize that Mia was sent here to help us all in whatever way possible. She was brought to this earth to show us courage and unconditional love, she was here to bring loving, caring people together from all over the world and to teach us all to never give up no matter what obstacles we may face. She taught us to be brave, to be strong, and to smile in the face of adversity. Most importantly, she taught us all how to love unconditionally!!
Since her death, Mia's story has inspired people to adopt animals with birth defects that may have otherwise been overlooked or not given a chance at life and love. Mia has educated thousands of people from all walks of life on how to care for a special needs animal. She has raised awareness as to, "If they are born, they deserve a chance to live!!" Because of her strength, determination, love and will to live, she has enriched the lives of countless individuals. She had a zest for life unlike any I have ever seen. Her tiny paw left a huge imprint on so very many hearts.
Mia has shown us all that miracles really do exist. She changed the world with just one smile!! Read more

What you need to know about the best digital pocket camera. . .
What is the best digital pocket camera out in the market today? Not all users have the same requirements; in order to choose the right camera, it is important to make your choice based on what you plan to do with it.
First off, set a budget and narrow your search down to a price range that works for you. This will also largely dictate the features you can have along with the camera of your choice. Ask around or do a little research on what setting options you should be looking out for. Meanwhile, here is a list of basic things you should know to help you decide on the best digital pocket camera to match your requirements.
MEGAPIXELS. This is one of the main pitching points for salespeople and camera makers when they want to sell us their products. The greater the megapixel, the higher the resolution. A high resolution simply means that an image is produced at a high level of detail which results in a clearer, sharper and more realistic photograph. If you intend to print out images larger than 8x10, you’ll do well to go for 10 megapixels or higher. However, the everyday user will find the 5-6 megapixel cameras perfectly capable of taking good quality snapshots.
ZOOM CAPABILITY. This is the camera function that causes to magnify or draw the image closer. It enables you to shoot close-up portraits or capture distant sceneries or landscapes. A higher optical zoom number always equates to a better camera. Don’t scrimp on this feature because you can never have too much zoom.
LCD SIZE. A large LCD screen in a pocket size camera is definitely a plus factor. It allows you to properly frame your subject for better composition and a more memorable photo. It also makes it easier to review and edit photos when working with a larger screen. In this regard, I suggest that you go for a camera with a 2.5 inch LCD or higher.
SIZE. You would not have ended up on this page if you were already clear about what you wanted in the first place. So remember, it is possible to bundle both useful and practical features into a compact size. Do your homework and check out different camera brands. Most importantly, small cameras get shots that big cameras don’t. The portability and convenience of a smaller unit enables you to capture that perfect moment – fish it out of your pocket or purse and you’ll easily out-snap the bulky camera owner in the group! And lastly. . .
IT”S YOU, NOT YOUR CAMERA. This is the most important tip to remember. Do not assume that the best and most expensive camera will take the best photographs. Not true. It’s not the camera that takes the pictures but the person behind the lens. Pick up some digital photography tips. Study new techniques. Practice what you learn. Remember, it’s up to you to make yours the best digital pocket camera there is.

Ever since he first heard the opening chords to "Smells Like Teen Spirit," at the age of 11, Daniel Kohn has been hooked on music. Born in New York City, raised in the music hotbed of Long Island and currently residing in Los Angeles, Kohn has been writing since high school, when he realized he could get CDs for free. He's a sucker for '90s music, especially that from Seattle. Like a small minority of Americans, he likes football of the European variety, especially Liverpool. When he's not chasing down bands, you can find him at your local pub with a pint of Carlsberg, usually at ungodly hours cheering on his beloved Reds.

Hey Blake,
I heard it's the 75th anniversary of Huey Long's assassination, but I don't know why he was killed or whether he was a good guy or a bad guy. What do you say?
Confused in Uptown
Dear Confused,
Huey Long was shot 75 years ago this week. As to whether he was good or bad, opinions vary — as is often the case with powerful people.
Huey Pierce Long Jr. was born in Winnfield, La., in 1893. His populist political style won him many admirers among the disadvantaged but made him the scourge of the wealthy. He served as Louisiana governor from 1928 to 1932 and as a U.S. senator from 1932 until he was shot in 1935. He reportedly planned to run for president against Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.
Nicknamed "The Kingfish" by friends (after a character on the radio show Amos 'n Andy), Long built a formidable political machine and ruled the state with an iron fist. He built his political empire on the idea that government should level the playing field between rich and poor — and that wealth should be redistributed toward that end.
With the country reeling from the Great Depression, Long in 1934 created his "Share Our Wealth" program, which called for the government to confiscate individual wealth in excess of $5 million (or an individual's income in excess of $1 million) and redistribute it to the less fortunate. As governor, he launched massive public works projects for bridges, roads, hospitals (including Charity Hospital in New Orleans) and colleges (most notably expanding LSU and building the LSU Medical School in New Orleans).
Long began his political career at age 25, when he was elected to the Louisiana Railroad Commission, a precursor to the Public Service Commission. He had a flair for politics and for innovation. He was the first Southern politician to use radio addresses and sound trucks while stumping for governor in 1924. He lost that race but was re-elected to the PSC, then ran successfully for governor in 1928 with a campaign slogan, "Every man a king, but no one wears a crown."
As governor, Long required state employees to pay a portion of their salaries directly into his political war chest, nicknamed the "deduct box." During his tenure, he gave schoolchildren free textbooks, instituted night courses that taught 100,000 adults to read, provided cheap natural gas to New Orleans and began his public works programs. He also bullied anyone who stood in his way, sometimes ruthlessly.
He was impeached by the Louisiana Legislature in 1929 but dodged conviction via a now-infamous device known as the round robin. It took two-thirds of the state Senate to convict him, so his allies got more than one third to sign a document pledging not to convict him no matter what the evidence against him might be. He then extended his power over all of state government and several local governments, including New Orleans. In the U.S. Senate, Long's political views (and popularity among the poor) reportedly pushed President Roosevelt farther to the left and inspired many New Deal programs.
Though busy nationally, Long continued to control state government. He was in Baton Rouge on Sept. 8, 1935, to oversee a special legislative session when he allegedly was shot by Dr. Carl Austin Weiss, whose father-in-law, Judge Benjamin Henry Pavy, had been gerrymandered out of his district as payback for opposing Long. Weiss was shot 32 times by Long's bodyguards and died. Long died two days later in a Baton Rouge hospital. He is buried beneath a massive monument that faces the State Capitol, which he built in record time.
Even today, 75 years after his death, Long casts quite a shadow over Louisiana politics — and he continues to spark heated political debates.

11. "Am-A-Do"
A romantic gem hidden amid the political and spiritual anthems that make up most of the 1974 masterpiece Natty Dread, "Am-A-Do" finds Marley slyly switching back and forth between lovey-dovey and freak-deaky, cooing "you're in the bottom of my heart" on the verse before talking dirty on the hook with the I-Threes.

Mark your calendars!
In a press release that just went out, we’ve announced the release dates for Brink (May 17th in North America, May 20th in Europe) and Hunted: The Demon’s Forge (June 1st in North America, June 3rd in Europe). The two games complete our Class of 2011 lineup, which also includes join RAGE (September 13th in North America, September 16th in Europe) and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (November 11th worldwide).
For more information, read the full press release below… ‘Lock.
Australian release date??
Australian release date for Brink??
For brink??
For those wondering, the release dates for Australia are the same as Europe.
Hey!
Where is the Macintosh platform?
Not so multi about platforms for which this games was made.
The best news!Now my calendar is officially the best read for 2011!lol
Rock on Beth.I love you people.
I am REALLY looking forward to RAGE, also looking forward to Skyrim.
Liam — it’s the 20th (for the purposes of releases, Australia is classified as a European territory)
Macs most likely have to rely on Steam.
I’m so excited for Brink!
Hey, I noticed you guys posted the PS3 packaging covers on your blog. Where’s the Xbox 360 love? lol Just kidding. I’m glad everyone is having a chance to play your games. You guys are the best!
You delayed the release date 2 times, I don’t know how to say this any way around so I will say it flatly:
Are you guys sure you can actually release the game on your release date this time?
@Boudewijn — we did move the “release window” twice, but this is our first official release date. We feel pretty good about it.
Nice work, Brink releases the same day as L.A. Noire. Tell me how the works out for your sales.
i am displeased with the waiting. Brink is gunna rock.
God bless you. only one day before my B-Day!!! cant wait for brink
Why do America get the release earlier than the UK? are you not a UK company?
why do you keep putting the release dates back. because first late 2010 people then got excited for that and then it was brought back. then march 25th people also then got excited for that, again it does not come. finally may 20th (in europe) it is set for release. if it gets put back again i’m not buying it i will wait for BC3.
Hey, what are the system requirements for BRINK on PC???
No dedicated servers for consoles and america get the release earlier, splitting people with cheap pre-order DLC. I expected more from you beth. Laggy P2P multiplayer with US advantage as per usual, sad choice.
For everyone complaining about release date changes, just think…it’s far better for a product to be pushed back than to release an inferior version of the game. If the developers feel they need more time to make some finishing touches, then they should probably take some more time to finish it up.
All that is needed on this one is for it to freeze up too….JUST LIKE FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS!!!! Bethesda people if you are listening…. fix the freezing on this one PRIOR to releasing it.

Bethesda Group Hopes to Build MoCo Children’s Museum
A group of Bethesda residents hopes to build a children’s museum Montgomery County can call its own.
Cara Lesser, founder of the Kids International Discovery KID Museum organization, has been hosting focus groups of county parents and partnering in county-sponsored events to help develop the project.
Lesser, who for 20 years worked in health policy and who has two kids of her own, said she saw a need for educational and volunteer-based programming aimed at kids. She and three others are working to publicize the effort and raise money.
“I’ve seen from my professional life and my personal life that we need to do a lot more to cultivate kids’ curiosity about the world and their compassion,” Lesser said.
The museum would be “a little bit of a hybrid” between a traditional children’s museum and a science center, Lesser said. It would be aimed at kids age 6-12, a little bit older age group than most children’s museums with an emphasis on learning about other cultures and promoting volunteer activities.
A “Global Connections” exhibit would explore the culture of a rotating group of countries through cooking, crafts and storytelling. A hand-on science exhibit and “Kids in Action” space are also planned.
The group is working on an economic feasibility study with a consultant that would help determine a location. Bethesda is a possibility.
In partnering with Montgomery County on its World of Montgomery Festival this fall in Wheaton, the KID Museum was able to work closely with county staff that have expressed great optimism about the project. Lesser said the museum would likely be the result of a private-public partnership and the KID Museum is taking donations through its website.
Montgomery County Schools Superintendent Josh Starr has been a big supporter of the initiative and is on the group’s advisory board.
For more information on the KID Museum, visit its website.

March
I have had two great things happen in the last two weeks. I went to the NAEA ( National Art Educators Association) Conference and two of my sculpture are in a show at the b.j. spoke gallery in Huntington, NY.
"Spirals " by Beth Heit at b.j. spoke gallery
Sumi-e paintingThe convention was lots of fun. I saw some people I haven't seen in a long time and took some wonderful workshops. The workshops got me to thinking about new ways to improve my teaching. I also learned sumi-e brush painting.
The exhibit at b.j. spoke gallery consists of paintings, sculptures, collages, scratchboard, photography and even video. It is a good selection of high quality interesting work. I am happy to be part of it. It is up until the end of March

Is Twitter Losing Its Appeal to Marketers
Has Twitter lost it’s appeal to business owners as a Marketing Platform? I think so and here is my logic.
Twitter has become over saturated with a 1000 followers following another 1000 followers and your messages are becoming diluted if they are even being seen at all. It’s not the amount of people that you have following you but the amount of people that you market to have following them.
Here is the logic:
Let’s say you have 50,000 followers and they follow 1000 others. You send out a tweet and only a small percentage of those 50,000 are online at any given time. Your tweet will show up on a small percentage of those followers radar and even a smaller percentage will engage with the link either re-tweet it or follow the link themselves. As you see the problem is very clear. The more people that are added to the Twitter platform the more diluted your market will become and your tweets will just get lost in the crowd.

is tweet a twerp?
Craig, I truly agree with you. Even on FB- I will see someone have 4900 friends....and yet not getting closer to no more than 100 or 200.
I posted some positives to The Birdie Machine :...
and yet there is only a positive response when you can actually DIRECT MESSAGE an individual.
I have one friend that has 14,000+ tweeters...she didn't see my DM for a whole week! then bragged that she is building her biz, and and she has 14k followers and it is impossible for her to get back quickly.
Hmmmm, where is the logic in that?
This goes back to the point? Now that you've got my information, what are you going to do with me?...
Thank you for your courage to post this-it may put us on the hot spot, but it will help those who are using this form of marketing.
Much success to you my friend,
~ME~
twerp
Michaela,
I love being in the hot seat. Controversy creates buzz and buzz is what attracts followers. You can't lead from the back of the pack. It's hilarious when you talk about those that have 14k followers and they think they are building their business but their to busy getting followers to get back to a real prospect.
One lesson I learned early about DM's is that you can't delete them with your automated system without looking at each one of them first. I spend an hour each morning replying to re-tweets and DM's of value.
If you like being in the hot seat lets help each other succeed. I will follow your messages and reciprocate.
Hope I spelled that right.
To your success,
Craig

This is a list of articles, photography and other media work I’ve done as a freelance photographer/journalist during August 2012. I intend to continue writing freelance articles and do more radio interviews in the future. They will be linked to on a regular basis.
I’ve been involved with a time consuming local community event this month so didn’t spend as much time doing journalism work.
Online Reviews & Analysis
Technology Spectator: Google’s nexus of complaints on 1st August 2012. Google’s move into hardware may have impressed its fans, but it still has plenty to learn about logistics and keeping its customers happy.
Technology Spectator: Nexus 7 Review on 2nd August. The combination of a competitive price, premium quality hardware from ASUS and new Android 4.1 Jellybean software from Google, make the Nexus 7 the clearly superior seven inch tablet option on the market. Also syndicated to Business Spectator.
Technology Spectator: Australia’s role in the Mars Curiosity landing on 7th August. NASA’s Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC) was crucial to the success of Mars Curiosity.
ABC Tech & Games: Nexus 7 tablet review on 14th August. Google’s release of its new Nexus 7 tablet is a break from the company’s standard practice, signalling its frustration with manufacturer partners in the Open Handset Alliance who have not managed to dent the market share of Apple’s iPad in any significant way.
At the end of August I visited Victoria to cover some automotive stories which I’ll write about in early September. This photo (courtesy of my friend Leigh Stark) is of me sitting in Ford Australia’s Virtual Reality 3D Car Simulator, viewing *inside* the car door lock.

Photojournalism
My favourites from the photos I took during August are:
From my Ken Duncan Panasonic Camera Testing 2 day trip on the Central Coast of NSW. It was the first time I’ve seen a Chameleon in real life
I had 2 hours spare during my trip to Victoria, which I spent taking photos of some of Melbourne’s famous Street Art such as the red dragon below.

An Amazing Fact: (or "containers") and be raptured up to a spacecraft traveling behind the comet that would take them to a higher plane of existence. A message posted on their website stated that "Hale-Bopp's approach is the 'marker' we've been waiting for-the time for the arrival of the spacecraft from the Level Above Human to take us home to 'Their World' in the literal Heavens." They sincerely believed the comet marked their "graduation" from the Human Evolutionary Level. "We are happily prepared to leave 'this world'," wrote cult leader Marshall Applewhite (alias "Do"), who quoted selectively from the Bible and various episodes of Star Trek to support his teachings that they would be raptured to this invisible spacecraft.
All around the world, people are struggling to understand the Bible's end-time prophecies. Christians everywhere sense that Jesus Christ will soon return to planet Earth.
In the 1990s, Bible scholar Tim LaHaye and storyteller Jerry Jenkins teamed up to create a fascinating series of novels designed to make the book of Revelation more real to Christians today. Their first book, published in 1995, was simply called Left Behind. This single book sold so many copies that Barnes & Noble Bookstores voted it "One of the top ten best-selling books of the 20th century." USA Today has labeled it "Wildly popular-and highly controversial."
Because of this incredible response, LaHaye and Jenkins decided to expand their project into a sequence of 12 books. The Indwelling-The Beast Takes Possession, was listed as a New York Times Bestseller. The Mark-The Beast Rules the World, became an immediate runaway hit. Amazingly, the entire project is now being called "The best-selling series of all time." On February 2, 2001, Left Behind: The Movie, produced by Cloud Ten Pictures, is scheduled to open in theaters across America.
A Gripping Saga The story begins with the sudden vanishing of Christians into thin air, which is commonly called the rapture. The rest of mankind, having been left behind, suddenly wake up to the nightmare of a world gone mad. Mass confusion hits as unmanned cars veer out of control, pilotless planes crash, fires erupt, and total hysteria sweeps over the globe. "The disappearances" will usher the world into "a seven-year period called the Tribulation" (Tribulation Force, inside cover). In the midst of this universal panic, a mysterious and yet secretly evil Romanian man named Nicolae Carpathia (the Antichrist) rises to bring order out of chaos. "One of the most powerful and charismatic personalities ever" (Ibid., ix), Carpathia takes control of the United Nations. Discerning his inner wickedness is a brave host of new believers (a.k.a. the Tribulation Force) who are determined to resist his hypnotic power. Finally, this sinister world leader unveils his ultimate test of loyalty: the insertion of a high-tech biochip into the foreheads and hands of all people.
The Left Behind series follows the lives of certain fictitious characters who, having missed the rapture, are forced to struggle against the Antichrist, his global community, and ultimately against the enforcement of the mark of the beast.
Just as millions of Americans daily follow the lives of their favorite soap opera actors, even so millions of Christians are now following the lives of these imaginary Left Behind personalities as the saga continues to unfold. Even young people are being affected through a special version of Left Behind books just for kids, which includes a Tribulation Force Underground Kit.
Underneath the excitement and drama of this incredibly popular story, is it possible that something is just not quite right? Could it be that in the midst of Left Behind's focus on missing people, important Bible truths are also missing? If so, which ones? Paul wrote, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:21).
Accepted vs. Accurate The Bible certainly does teach the exciting truth that Jesus Christ will return for His people. Jesus Himself said, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself" (John 14:3). The clearest text in the Bible about the rapture is 1 Thessalonians 4:17. Countless Christians know it by heart, and it is cited in Left Behind: The Movie. Paul wrote that believers in Jesus Christ will someday be "caught up ... in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air" (1 Thessalonians 4:17). What we must do is to carefully examine the timing of the rapture, for this is a crucial issue.
According to Left Behind, the return of Jesus Christ actually takes place in two distinct phases. First, Jesus returns silently and secretly to catch away true believers. This begins the "seven-year period called the Tribulation." During the Tribulation, this diabolical man known as the Antichrist rises to enforce the mark of the beast. At the end of the Tribulation, our Lord returns visibly, which is called Christ's "glorious appearing."
Therefore, according to Left Behind, the rapture comes first, and then, seven years later, is the second coming of Jesus Christ at the end of the world. With minor variations, this scenario is now accepted by millions of Bible-believing Christians around the globe as an accurate picture of end-time events.
There are three mighty pillars that stand out in this teaching, and it is safe to say that the entire Left Behind project rests firmly atop each one of them.
We wish to follow Paul's counsel to "Prove all things" by carefully examining these pillars, in the light of Scripture, while watching out for any signs of structural cracks.
Perfect Timing Pillar 1 says that the rapture and the second coming do not occur simultaneously. Paul clearly states in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 that "We which are alive and remain shall be caught up." Although the exact word "rapture" doesn't appear anywhere in the Bible, the idea comes from those two words "caught up." A simple comparison of verse 17 with verse 15, which says, "We which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord," makes it very clear that believers will be "caught up" at "the coming of the Lord."
At this point, we must carefully examine what the Bible says about His coming. Will believers be caught up at a silent and invisible coming of the Lord before the Tribulation, as taught in Left Behind? Or will believers be caught up at the deafening "glorious appearing" of Jesus Christ at the end of the world?
Right in between verses 15 and 17, Paul wrote, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump [or trumpet] of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first" (1 Thessalonians 4:16). Left Behind describes this as a silent and secret event, yet doesn't it sound rather loud and noisy? There is a shout, a voice, and a trumpet.
A long time ago, Jeremiah recorded a prophecy regarding the coming of the Lord that clearly parallels 1 Thessalonians 4:16. He).
Both Jeremiah and Paul describe a coming of the Lord during which there is a loud "voice" and "a shout." Jeremiah provides additional information by saying that the Lord will "mightily roar," and then he says that a "noise" shall be heard worldwide. None of this sounds like a silent and secret return of Jesus prior to the Tribulation.
A Thief in the Night Paul said this tremendous "day of the Lord" will finally arrive like "a thief in the night" (1 Thessalonians 5:2). Many interpret this to mean that Jesus will come like a silent thief to steal believers out of this world. Then cars will crash, planes will collide, sacked quarterbacks at football games will vanish, and babies will be missing from their cribs. The popular Christian film A Thief in the Night, which is similar to Left Behind: The Movie, also presents this perspective. Yet is this really what Paul is saying?
Again, let's take a closer look at Scripture. Paul wrote: ).
Do you see what Paul is saying? Jesus' coming as a "thief in the night" does not mean He will come quietly and invisibly to steal believers out of this world, as is taught in Left Behind. Rather, it means He will come unexpectedly, bringing "sudden destruction" upon the unsaved. It is not secret, only sudden. Notice again what Paul said: "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness" (verses 4-5). Did you catch that? Jesus does not come as a thief in the night to believers, but only to those who are of the night. Will those who are "of the night"-that is, the unprepared-be given a second chance to be saved? Paul wrote, "They shall not escape" (verse 3).
The apostle Peter also wrote about this same return of Jesus Christ as a thief in the). According to Peter, this coming of Jesus Christ as a thief in the night is definitely not a silent and secret event that precedes a seven-year period of Tribulation. Rather, this day arrives suddenly, with "a great noise" (as also described by Jeremiah), and is clearly associated with the end of the world! A crack is forming in Pillar 1.
What about the rapture taking place "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye"? This is probably the second greatest text in the Bible now being used to support the idea of Christians vanishing prior to the Tribulation.).
Is Paul saying that believers will mysteriously vanish from the earth prior to the Tribulation, while their loved ones blink? Not at all! He is saying that the dead will be raised and their bodies will be changed "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye." But when will this "moment" take place? Paul's answer is clear. It will occur "at the last trump," when "the trumpet shall sound," at the end of the world. This is that very same "great sound of a trumpet" Jesus said would be heard at His second coming (Matthew 24:31)!
Pillar 1 is disintegrating.
Waiting Until It's Too Late As previously noted, Pillar 2 supporting the Left Behind project is the theory that those who miss the rapture will have during the Tribulation a second chance to be saved. This idea is dangerous because it leads some people to rationalize that "If the Bible is really true and if the rapture does take place, then I'll know for sure God is real. It may be tough, but I can still join the Tribulation Force during the seven years. Even if that Antichrist guy tries to kill me, I will resist the mark!"
While fostering this foolish attitude is certainly not the intent of the Left Behind authors, nevertheless, the secret rapture theory can easily lead people to adopt a "wait and see" philosophy, and thus put off making a decision to follow Jesus. Paul wrote that all who are not fully on the Lord's side when believers are "caught up" (1 Thessalonians 4:17) "shall not escape" (1 Thessalonians 5:3). As you can see, Pillar 2 has very serious problems.
Left Behind also teaches that the Church will not be here on earth for Armageddon. Is this true?
The word "Armageddon" appears only once in the Bible. It is found in Revelation 16, the great chapter describing the falling of the seven last plagues. Between the sixth and seventh last plagues, Jesus Christ thunders: "Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon" (Revelation 16:15-16).
Did you catch that? Jesus is talking to the Church! While the seven plagues are falling, and right before the battle of Armageddon, Jesus Christ has not yet come as a thief! Therefore He must come like a thief at Armageddon, and that must be the time when He comes to gather His Church.
Paul used the language of the military when, like a commanding officer, he urged the soldiers of the cross to "Take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand" (Ephesians 6:13). How can we stand in "the evil day" if we have previously disappeared? Jesus Christ also said to the believers, "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake. … But he who endures to the end shall be saved" (Matthew 24:9, 13, NKJV). Paul also advised the church that "we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22).
Jesus will save His church-not from tribulation, but rather through it! Our Lord loves us and will strengthen us in the final times. That's why He promised: "I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world" (Matthew 28:20). We can trust Him in this.
What About the Seven Years? The Bible text that serves as the foundation for the entire seven-year Tribulation theory is Daniel 9:27, which is the very first verse quoted in Left Behind: The Movie. It says: "He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week; and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice ... to cease."
A day in prophecy represents a year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6), thus the period of "one week" actually represents seven years. Millions are now applying this to a future seven-year period of Tribulation. "He" is interpreted to be the Antichrist, who will make a covenant with the Jews during the Tribulation.
What many don't realize is that there is a more logical interpretation that has far more biblical support. It has been taught by many credible Bible scholars who have written respected commentaries that are now in the libraries of pastors across America. One example is the world-famous Matthew Henry's Bible commentary. It doesn't apply Daniel 9:27 to the Antichrist at all, nor does it apply the "one week" to a seven-year period of Tribulation after the rapture. Rather, it applies the prophecy to Jesus Christ, who, after three and a half years of loving ministry, died "in the midst of the week," which ultimately caused all animal sacrifices to cease!
Here's the quotation from Matthew Henry's famous commentary: "By offering himself a sacrifice once and for all he [Jesus] shall put an end to all Levitical sacrifices."1 Another excellent Bible commentary written by Adam Clarke says that during the "term of seven years" (Daniel 9:27), Jesus Christ would "confirm or ratify the new covenant with mankind."2 Here's one more from the much-respected Jamieson, Fausset and Brown commentary: "He shall confirm the covenant-Christ. The confirmation of the covenant is assigned to Him."3
Take a careful look at Daniel 9:27 itself. God's Word says, "He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week." Notice that Jesus Christ Himself said, "This is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many" (Matthew 26:28, NKJV). A perfect fit! Both use the words "covenant" and "many."
Our Lord Jesus Christ is the One through whom "the covenant … was confirmed" (Galatians 3:17; see also Romans 15:8, NKJV). In the midst of the week, after three and a half years, Jesus gave His life for us, "causing the sacrifice to cease." He was the final Sacrifice. No more sacrifices are to be offered (Hebrews 10:12). Period.
In my earlier book, Exploding the Israel Deception, Chapter 5 is called "The 70th Week of Daniel Delusion." There I give many more solid reasons why Daniel 9:27 doesn't apply to the Antichrist at all, but to Jesus Christ alone.
The entire Left Behind idea of a seven-year period of Tribulation after the rapture may go down in history as the greatest evangelical misinterpretation of all time. The whole concept is like a gigantic bubble. Once Daniel 9:27 is correctly understood and the pointed pin of truth is inserted, "Pop goes the seven years!"
A Life-or-Death Matter I want to conclude by talking about Pillar 3, which states that true believers today will not have to face the Antichrist and the mark of the beast. It is right here that emotions fly and reason vanishes just as instantaneously as those disappearing Christians in Left Behind: The Movie. That's because the mysterious mark of the beast is a life-or-death matter. It concerns the destiny of the human soul. Admitting that the Church will still be on earth during the final great Tribulation means that Christians must someday face the Antichrist and the mark of the beast-issues over which they could lose their souls. Many people are deeply afraid of this, so they conclude there must be a secret rapture before the Tribulation. There just has to be!
A deep-seated fear of the mark plagues many people, though it need not be so. True Christians can learn a lesson from popular bumper stickers that say "Fear No Evil." We don't need to be afraid. We can trust in Jesus Christ, for He has promised, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world" (Matthew 28:20). If the fictitious Tribulation Force in the Left Behind novels can overcome the Antichrist and the mark of the beast with God's help, then so can we!
For those who are unwilling to even reasonably consider this issue, no amount of Bible evidence will convince them. Like a triple-bolted door in downtown New York, they are closed to the facts.
The result? Truth is left behind.

The TSRs north of Wagga were some of the most beautiful that I have visited especially at Eunony Lagoon/Broman Lagoon. Using the unformed roads and the traditional campsites on the TSRs is a most underutilized resource for touring cyclists. I have The Long Paddock, the atlas and directory of the TSRs in NSW ... which is a big help to finding these not often visited places.I liked the flat roads on the floodplains which was something I haven't experienced for many years ... and I liked it. I saw many roadies enjoying the back roads north of Wagga Wagga. More riders on a weekend than I would see in Canberra. Warren.

reports Reuters.
Reuters' story is based on a report in Chinese finance magazine Caijing, which quoted government sources as saying the studio would be formed with a consortium of Chinese media companies.
"DreamWorks Animation and the consortium would invest a total of $2 billion in the joint venture, DreamWorks East, over the next five years to produce animation for the Chinese market."
Caijing reported that CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg was in China earlier this month to discuss the plan with government officials there.

DreamWorks Animation in Talks to Build Shanghai Studio
Labels: DreamWorks, Jeffery Katzenberg
21 comments:
Makes sense, DreamWorks is big around those parts so it'd make sense for them at least to protect their properties as well as make some things for a local audience.
Dreamworks and Communism. What a pair! :D
It's like Pixar Canada, but in a worse country! (Did you know that Pixar Canada isn't too far from where "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" is made?)
You're not cool with Pixar Canada?
@Jordan: Careful what you say!
Mike's from Canada, you know ;-)
@Jordan
Cool! I love 'Friendship is Magic'. I guess now that they have Pixar and Ponies, that makes Canada about 20% cooler!
Mike, I don't think that's what Jordan meant. I don't really have an opinion about Pixar Canada, as they have only made one Mater short so far. (I didn't like any of the Mater films from the Emeryville studio either)...I'll wait for Pixar Canada to make something else. But I can tell you why Pixar went to Vancouver and Dreamworks went to Shanghai.
Pixar loves their employees, so they set up their extra studio in a beautiful city.
Dreamworks wants to produce as much animation as quickly possible, and what a better way to get cheap labor then to offshore to China?! :D
Yeah, people are misunderstanding me. I like Pixar Canada. I know that a lot of great animation and cartoons (mostly for TV) come from Canada. Vancouver and Ontario are where it's at! Pixar Canada's in British Colombia, right? I know that Studio B/DHX Media Vancouver (they changed their name at the start of Season 2 of FiM) is in Vancouver.
And on a related note, the FiM team does outsource some of their animation to Top Draw Animation in the Philippines, where an animator with the initials VDC leaked a "Pinkie Pie Smile" song. (I could go on about that with my theories of how and why, but I won't.)
My thing against China is their problems with free speech, Internet censorship, human rights, and the condition of factories where less-than-stellar pony toys are made.
For Shanghai being Communist they are sure doing well economically like Hong Kong. Are they really Communist or Capitalist? I'd move there if i had a chance.
@Anonymous: I wouldn't be too quick to assume that. Dreamworks offers its employees a better benefits package, and generally better salaries, than Pixar does. Also, Dreamworks has never been investigated for borderline illegal labor practices.
Not that I'm saying that Pixar is in any way a bad place to work. It is, however, for all the brilliant people involved, still a corporation, and it loves its employees only to the degree that they help make the company money.
Kevin, Pixar was investigated for borderline illegal practices? Where's your source, or were you talking about the Disney company in general, which I do know to be true.
There's some truth to the fact that as a corporation, the key end is making money. My thoughts on the company don't come from an insider's perspective, but rather from my general impressions from watching the movies themselves. I have enjoyed more consistently the Pixar films than I have the Dreamworks film. And I think that is due to the artists having more creative freedom.
And creative freedom usually comes from treating your core employees, at the very least, pretty well.
As for the anon comment about Communism, I was taking a jab at China's complete disregard for freedom of speech, and comparing it to the lack of creative control the Dreamworks artists have. :P
There's no doubt that China is about big business, but Jordan's right. Censorship and state control on ideas are bad.
While I'm here, is anyone else who reads this blog a brony like me?
Complete my brohoof:

(\ Brohoof for Jordan!
I've been reading this blog for years and always enjoyed your comments, but you just got 20% cooler! ; )
Ponies and Pixar forever!!!
@Anonymous:
And I like Pixar films, on average, more than Dreamworks films too. So do most animators, which is why they're willing to work there for a slightly lower salary than they could make somewhere else.
I enjoy FiM, but I'm not an obsessed lunatic like most of the internet.
@Tanner
Same here. I just enjoy the show, I don't really consider myself a 'brony', but I thought, 'eh, what could a little brohoof hurt'?
Dreamworks and China. Both have about the same quality of products.
@ JAY Hosh
Ha, ha, ha ZING!
Take THAT, CRAPworks! Ha, ha, ha!!!
Anyone who likes FiM in some regard should at least check out the Equestria Daily blog.

We are about to get a reasonable clear picture of this years roster against three top level MLS teams--LA, RBNY and RSL. We know our roster isn't complete but what we don't know is what ---if any --- significant improvements have been made during this offseason in out ability to compete in MLS. These three tests should clarify some of the questions we've been bantering around. First game is against LA on the 22nd and I think it will be streamed so we can get a first hand look at the 2012 Revs

I'm fairly new to trail riding, and was wondering what some of the safety measure I should take are, and what are some etiquettes I should know? I know the usual stuff like wear a helmet and try to stay hydrated and the such, but what are some others?

Upon his return to the United States in 1990, Bill attended Park View High School, where he became Lord of the Drama Geeks (as pictured at right).
Bill then made his way to James Madison University, where he spent five years battling the corrupt administration and the entrenched evil of Fraternity Row. It was here that Bill discovered that he was superhumanly attractive to men - though his abilities only seem to work on straight men, strangely enough. Bill and a victim of his powers are pictured below.
After college, Bill bummed around the country having adventures, eventually settling in Athens, Georgia, where he worked a wide variety of crappy jobs, which included washing dishes, making sandwiches, tending bar, and grading term papers for the University of Georgia. A freak lab accident then caused both of Bill's roommates to evaporate, along with their share of the rent, and Bill was forced to flee back to Virginia and lick his financial wounds.
Bill was soon enslaved by the Starbucks corporation, and he was forced to schlep coffe for yuppie drones 14 hours a day. It was during this time that he developed his crippling addiction to caffeine, and gained coffee knowledge beyond that of mortal men.
Finally breaking free from Starbucks, Bill took a positon as a lowly editorial assistant at the Washington Blade newspaper, a weekly gay newspaper. Though he tried to pass himself off as a mild-mannered journalist, Bill's genius could not be hidden for long, and he quickly rose through the ranks, eventually becoming Arts Editor of their sister paper, the New York Blade, and he moved to the Big City.
Alas, the Blade was purchased by yet another evil corporation, and Bill was laid off. Fortunately, this has freed him to concentrate full-time on his writing, and to spreading the power of the Bill Roundy Fan Club.
Back to the Club!

Although I didn't mention it there is a script (ReverseLookup.php) that does a true reverse lookup (if that's what you're looking for). It's essentially a hack that grabs the info from phonenumber.com. It's just nice because it filters out the ads for you.
I took Raven's interface from the NPA script, threw it into this script, and posted the source with a command-line Perl tool to do all the work without your web-browser. Enjoy it!
Oh, and someone tried to pass the string "drop table users" to my NPA script. Briefly, it didn't work because the NXX variable gets converted to an int before it's put into the MySQL statement. In the end the string ends up as the numeric value "0". Sorry.

Chicago Meeting

Also, I think it'd be interesting to have a Saturday afternoon time- say second or third sat. of the month so geek time won't take up another Friday night.
The Panera is bigger and it has truly free wifi as opposed to starbucks t-mobile hotspot- so I think Panera's a better pick. There's a nice patio for outside seating as well.

Me and kn0x are collecting memberships to our shell server project.
We are asking for $5 per month (3 months for $17 (an extra $2 for Paypal) to (somewhat)cover our initial costs.
We are planning to offer a Secure Jabber Server with PGP-PKI encryption(membership not required) for secure private IM communications for the hacker community.
Shell accounts on our Debian server will include access to our HTTP proxy (via SSH tunneling) irssi, naim, etc. (so you can use your favorite irc/IM networks, email clients, web space, BBS, and more). User directories will be encrypted, and will only be offered to people we can trust who come to the meeting.
We reserve the right to deny you service for any reason including, but not limited to: lack of skill, body odor, being ugly, etc. Obviously there will be no P2P, warez, pr0n, cracking, etc.
PayPal payments are being accepted right now at: chishells@gmail.com.
P.S. We are also struggling to come up with a name. Email me or kn0x about a name you think is good. If we use your name, we will give you $5 off (one month free) your shell purchase.

A few of us from Chicago want to start a meeting. We have possible locations, but we need some input on when (day and time).

and/or

They are on the small side, we had 8 people show up last meet, anymore show up this time and we are taking up way to much room. Everyone would have to buy something or at least some people would, inorder for us to stay there.
It wouldn't really be a "Chicago" BinRev meeting if its outside the city of Chicago.
The WIFI at the places are pay per use, 30 for a month, 10 for a day. Yes, PTunnel worked before, but not everyone would be using it, and it's stealing.
As for BreakDanceJs house, even if we held it there I still don't think he would make it to the meeting.
Miche'le has the right idea, the grass area by the concert in MP would be good. We could do some outdoor WarWalking\Scanning next time. If I can find my pigtail I can bring my cantenna and we can scan for WIFI and point it at tall buildings to see what we find.
I think our problem with the last meeting was that we had one just to have one, we didn't really do much other than "hang out" but I bet if we come up with a schedule and some "hacking" activities that the next meeting would be really well. Also since it will be after Defcon, many of us will have stories of Defcon and other cool stuff. So it should be a lot more intresting.

ORLANDO In research to be presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting, investigators at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston offer a new explanation of why chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) tends to recur in the lymph nodes and bone marrow after being cleared from the bloodstream by chemotherapy. Their findings will be reported during in an oral session on Monday, Dec. 6, at 4:45 p.m. in room 315 of the Orange County Convention Center.
To uncover the reasons for CLL's resilience in the marrow and lymph nodes, the researchers employed a technique called BH3 profiling, which had been devised by senior author Anthony Letai, MD, PhD, and his Dana-Farber colleagues in 2005. The technique makes it possible to identify cancer cells that are less likely to undergo mitochondrial apoptosis (a form of programmed cell death involving cell structures called mitochondria) because of alterations in the Bcl-2 family of proteins. These abnormalities can make such cells less susceptible to both standard chemotherapy and novel, targeted agents.
In the current study, Letai and his associates found that when CLL cells from patients were grown with non-cancerous support cells from the bone marrow and lymph nodes, the CLL cells were more resistant to apoptosis and hence harder to kill with treatment than were CLL cells from the bloodstream. Using BH3 profiling, they discovered that although circulating CLL cells were likely to die by mitochondrial apoptosis in response to treatment, CLL cells grown among non-cancerous cells were much less likely to die this way. The presence of these normal cells, known as stroma, apparently helped the CLL cells survive, despite receiving treatment that would otherwise have resulted in their death.
"We hope that by clearly identifying the ability of stromal cells to reduce the CLL cells' capability to undergo apoptosis, we can exploit strategies to selectively target the 'help' that stroma

Why dont you ask Walter Gerhard. He has lots of monoclonals to HA. With Medline you should anyhow be able to find papers of him regarding mAbs specific for known determinants on HA. Regarding the full sequnce of PR/8/34, arent you able to use GCG with your known Canton reference (just pick a piece of it) and "fasta"? One of the references you do find (if not to lazy) is Winter, Fields and Brownlee. Just a hint: if you use the peptide sequence "FERFEIFPK" for searching with GCG you will be able to find lots of HAs of different strains, including the one you need.

Green feature less square footage, alternative energy sources such as solar panels, working with the natural lay of the land, and using natural insulation to decrease the need for energy. Green home building incorporates as many of these ideas as possible in addition to using sustainable construction materials.
There are a wide array of materials and techniques used in green home building. One of the most popular is strawbale building. Straw is a renewable resource and a fantastic insulator. It is easy to build with and costs significantly less than traditional construction materials. It has become so popular that many banks are willing to lend on the technique. In the Southwestern United States, strawbale homes are becoming commonplace. Strawbale home construction uses about 15% less wood than traditional home construction.
In addition to straw, there are many other renewable resources used in green home building. Adobe homes are made from moistened dirt combined with straw or other natural materials and dried in the desired shape. Cob is a technique similar to adobe building. Earth and straw are combined in the same way, but with a higher concentration of long straw fibers. It is extremely labor intensive as it must be applied by hand, but provides a low-cost, low-impact, green home building method. Rammed earth is another form of building using clay and straw. However, the materials must be tamped down, usually by heavy machinery.
Poured earth is a green home building material similar to concrete. It is mixed and formed in the same way as concrete and even uses Portland cement as a binder. However, poured earth does not contain the sand or gravel aggregate used in concrete. Instead, soil is used, resulting in a medium strength concrete that is very easy to maintain. Resistance to the elements is high and maintenance is virtually non-existent once the building is established. The construction costs can be significantly higher, as much as 20%, due to the labor involved in the process.
Earthbags, or sandbags, are another popular material used for green home building. They are inexpensive and can be readily and quickly constructed. Homes built from earthbags are resistant to severe weather, and offer superior strength and durability.
Cordwood building features short pieces of wood, normally about the size of firewood. This technique makes it possible to use wood that might not otherwise be useful for construction. The process is similar to laying bricks and mortar, with the cordwood functioning as the “bricks”. It is an inexpensive and beautiful green home building technique that is gaining in popularity.
Other methods of green home building include using materials such as bamboo, lightweight concrete, and stone. Natural builders use these materials to produce beautiful, functional homes without unneeded stress on the environment and to conserve precious energy, both in the short and long term.

Abstract
Background
Early childhood is critical to the development of lifelong food habits. Given the high proportion of children with inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, identification of modifiable factors associated with higher consumption may be useful in developing interventions to address this public health issue. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of the home food environment that are associated with higher fruit and vegetable consumption in a sample of Australian preschool children.
Methods
A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted with 396 parents of 3 to 5 year-old children attending 30 preschools within the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia., family eating policies and family mealtime practices. Characteristics of the home food environment that showed evidence of an association with children's fruit and vegetable consumption in simple regression models were entered into a backwards stepwise multiple regression analysis. The multiple regression analysis used generalised linear mixed models, controlled for parental education, household income and child gender, and was adjusted for the correlation between children's fruit and vegetable consumption within a preschool.
Results
The multiple regression analysis found positive associations between children's fruit and vegetable consumption and parental fruit and vegetable intake (p = 0.005), fruit and vegetable availability (p = 0.006) and accessibility (p = 0.012), the number of occasions each day that parents provided their child with fruit and vegetables (p < 0.001), and allowing children to eat only at set meal times all or most of the time (p = 0.006). Combined, these characteristics of the home food environment accounted for 48% of the variation in the child's fruit and vegetable score.
Conclusions
This study identified a range of modifiable characteristics within the home food environment that are associated with fruit and vegetable consumption among preschool children. Such characteristics could be considered potential targets for interventions to promote intake among children of this age.
Background
Adequate consumption of fruit and vegetables provides children with essential nutrients for healthy growth and development [1] and may displace the consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods associated with childhood overweight and obesity [2-6]. Given that childhood diet is a significant determinant of adult diet [7] and higher fruit and vegetable consumption in childhood is associated with decreased risk of adult chronic disease [8,9], the benefits of adequate childhood fruit and vegetable consumption appear to extend throughout the lifespan. Despite this, internationally, a high proportion of children have inadequate fruit and vegetable intake [10,11]. Identifying factors associated with higher childhood fruit and vegetable consumption may assist in the development of interventions to address this public health issue.
Many factors influence the foods that children eat: the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of their families [10,11]; their individual preferences and genetic predispositions [12,13]; psychosocial factors [14]; and characteristics of their environment [15,16]. Given the amount of time children spend in the home, this environment represents a potentially promising setting in which to improve young children's fruit and vegetable consumption. Rosenkranz's ecological model of the home food environment hypothesises that child diet in this setting is influenced by three domains: built and natural environments; political and economic environments; and socio-cultural environments [17]. Of these, those most proximal to a child's life, such as home accessibility and availability of foods (built and natural environments) and parental diet, parenting practices and rules, and family eating patterns (socio-cultural environments) may be most amenable to intervention. As such, research investigating associations between these characteristics of the home environment and children's fruit and vegetable consumption is warranted.
Studies of school-aged children have found parental fruit and vegetable intake and the accessibility and availability of fruit and vegetables in the home [12,15,16] to be consistently associated with children's consumption. However, research involving children of preschool age (children aged 3 to 5 years [18]) is limited. For example, a 2007 systematic review that included environmental correlates of children's fruit and vegetable intake identified just three studies involving children of preschool-age, compared with 30 studies involving children aged 5-18 years [16], while a more recent systematic review only included studies of children aged 6 years and older [15]. The factors influencing dietary habits in early childhood be may distinct from those affecting school-aged children, due to preschoolers' earlier developmental stage and greater dependence on their family [15]. The few studies that have investigated associations between such factors and fruit and vegetable consumption in preschool children found positive associations with parental fruit and vegetable intake [19-21] and parental role-modeling [22]; and negative associations with eating in front of the television [23] and parental pressure to eat [21,23]. However, only a minority of these studies, have used both a comprehensive or validated assessment of child fruit and vegetable consumption and multivariate analyses to isolate the effect of individual variables and control for the influence of socio-demographic characteristics [20,21]. As such, this study sought to address these limitations, and identify characteristics of the home food environment associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in a sample of Australian preschool children.
Methods
Design
A cross-sectional survey of parents of preschool-aged children was conducted via Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI).
Ethical approval
The data for the present study forms the baseline dataset for a cluster randomised controlled trial of a telephone-based intervention to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in preschool children [24]. Ethical approval for the broader trial was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of Newcastle (Ref No. H-2008-0410) and the Hunter New England Area Health Service (Ref No. 08/10/15/5.09).
Sample
Study participants were parents of 3 to 5 year-old children attending non-government preschools within the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia. Almost 90% of preschools within New South Wales are either privately run or run by the community [25]. All participants had previously volunteered to participate in a telephone-based randomised controlled trial of a fruit and vegetable intervention [24]. Preschools were ineligible if they provided children with meals, if they catered exclusively for children with special needs, were government preschools (as the conduct of this research was not approved in these institutions) or if they had participated in child healthy eating research projects within the prior six months. Parents were eligible if they resided with their preschool child for at least 4 days per week and were responsible for their child's meals and snacks at least half of the time. If children had dietary restrictions that were incompatible with the Australian Dietary Guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption (as determined by an Accrediting Practicing Dietitian), their parents were deemed ineligible.
Recruitment
Recruitment procedures are described in detail elsewhere [24] and are based on a systematic review identifying effective strategies for recruiting parents for study participation through schools [26]. Briefly, all eligible preschools within the study area were invited to participate. At consenting preschools, a research assistant distributed study information and consent forms to parents as they dropped off or picked up their child. Parents indicated their consent by ticking a box on the consent form and returning it to a drop box at the preschool. Recruitment of preschools began in February 2010 and recruitment of parents began in March 2010 and was conducted over a 6-month period. The consent form contained questions about the parent's residential suburb, the child's age, gender, and usual fruit and vegetable consumption (average number of serves per day). In order to assess bias due to selective non-participation, parents who did not wish to participate in the study were encouraged to also complete a consent form with this information and return it to the preschool.
Data Collection
Consenting parents were contacted to complete a telephone survey via CATI delivered by telephone interviewers experienced in conducting health-related interviews. The survey was conducted from April to October 2010. Parents were instructed to answer with respect to their preschool-aged child. If they had more than one child aged 3 to 5 years, they were instructed to select the child who would have the next birthday.
Measures
Participant characteristics
The survey included items to assess the socio-demographic characteristics of parents and children. Parents were asked their age, gender, highest level of education and annual household income and whether they identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander, and were asked to report their child's date of birth and gender. Items were sourced from population health surveys [27]. Parents were also asked the number of days per week that they resided with their child, and how often they were responsible for providing their child with meals and snacks (always, most of the time, half of the time, seldom, never).
Children's fruit and vegetable intake
Participants also completed the fruit and vegetable subscale of the Children's Dietary Questionnaire (CDQ) [28]. This subscale requires parents to report the variety and frequency of fruit and vegetables consumed by their child over the past 24 hours and past 7 days. This tool includes potatoes and sweet potatoes in the assessment of vegetable consumption, but parents are specifically instructed not to include hot chips. Fruit and vegetable juices are excluded from most (3 out of 4) questions assessing the frequency and variety of fruit intake, with the exception of the number of occasions of fruit or vegetable consumption over the past 24 hours. The subscale score ranges from 0 to 28 and a score of 14 or more suggests that the child has intake patterns consistent with fruit and vegetable dietary guidelines [28]. Changes on this score could arise from a range of possible changes to children's fruit and vegetable consumption patterns, for example, a one-point increase could result from eating an additional type of fruit or vegetable, or eating fruit or vegetable at an additional occasion in the previous 24 hours. This subscale has been established as reliable in comparable samples of preschoolers (intracorrelation coefficient = 0.75), and has been established as valid against a 7-day dietary checklist in a sample of school-aged children (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.58) [28].
Characteristics of the home food environment
Characteristics of the home food environment were assessed within seven domains: Parental role-modeling of fruit and vegetable consumption, pressure to eat, parental provision of fruit and vegetables, fruit and vegetable availability, fruit and vegetable accessibility, mealtime practices and family eating policies. Where possible, items were taken from existing validated measures of the home food environment including The Healthy Home Survey [29], The Child Feeding Questionnaire [30] and The National Nutrition Survey [31]. Where known, the reliability and validity of items are provided alongside each item. Study items with unknown psychometric properties are also identified.
a) Parental role-modeling of fruit and vegetable consumption
Items from the National Nutrition Survey were included to assess the average number of serves of fruit and vegetables consumed each day by parents [31]. Answers to these questions have been positively associated with objective biomarkers of fruit and vegetable intake including α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin and red-cell folate [32]. A lack of existing role-modeling items that were specific to fruit and vegetable consumption, quantitative, and targeted at parents of preschool children led the study team to develop two items to assess this. Specifically, parents were asked separate questions regarding the number of times they had consumed fruits, and the number of times they had consumed vegetables, in front of their child on the previous day. The validity of these items is unknown.
b) Pressure to eat
The 'Pressure to Eat' subscale from Birch's Child Feeding Questionnaire was included to measure the extent to which parents try to control the amount and type of food eaten by their child [30]. Scores range from 1 to 5 and a higher score indicates more pressure. The four-item scale has been shown to be internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.70) and reliability estimates for the four items of this subscale are 0.19-0.52 [30].
c) Parental provision of fruit and vegetables
As no items or scales could be identified that measured the extent to which parents provided their children with fruit and vegetables, two questions were developed specifically for this study, and as such their psychometric properties are unknown. Separate questions were asked regarding the number of occasions on the previous day that the parent provided the child with fruits and with vegetables.
d) Availability of fruit and vegetables in the home
As no appropriate measure of home fruit and vegetable availability that was brief, suitable for telephone data collection, and appropriate for use within an Australian sample could be sourced, to assess this, parents were read a list of 19 commonly consumed fruits and 24 commonly consumed vegetables from the Children's Dietary Questionnaire. Fruit and vegetables could be available in any form: fresh, tinned, frozen or dried. Parents were asked to identify those that they had in their home at that time and the number of varieties of fruits and vegetables were then summed. The validity and reliability of this item are unknown.
e) Accessibility of fruit and vegetables in the home
Accessibility was assessed by asking whether fruit and vegetables in the home were stored in a form that facilitated their consumption, for example, washed and chopped. The vegetable item was taken from the Healthy Home Survey (item reliability, kappa = 0.57, item validity, kappa = 0.43) [29]. The reliability and validity of the Healthy Home survey items were established in a study of 85 American families with 3 to 8 year-old children by having 50% of the sample re-do the survey one week after the first administration, and by a home-visit to 95% of participants [29]. As there was no equivalent item for fruit, this was adapted from the vegetable item, specifically: Do you have any ready to eat fresh fruit on a shelf in the refrigerator or on the kitchen counter now, for example, fruit you have washed or chopped to make ready to eat, like bunches of grapes, berries, or oranges?
f) Mealtime practices
The extent to which the family was adopting mealtime practices that encouraged child fruit and vegetable consumption was measured using items from the Healthy Home Survey. Items taken from this survey included the location where most meals are eaten, the number of days per week the family sits at a table to eat dinner together, and the number of days per week the child eats dinner in front of the television (Item reliability kappa = 0.73-0.80) [29].
g) Family eating policies
Questions from the Healthy Home Survey were also included to assess the extent to which parents adopted eating policies that encouraged fruit and vegetable consumption. On a five-point likert scale ('all of the time' to 'never') parents recalled the frequency with which they did each of the following: ask their child to eat everything on their plate at dinner; restrict dessert if their child does not eat the food on their plate at dinner; reward their child with desserts, snacks or confectionary if they finish their dinner; allow their child to eat only at set meal times; and allow their child to help him/herself to snacks when at home (Item reliability kappa = 0.40-0.75) [29].
Analysis
All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample. Where quantitative items were used to collect information about environmental characteristics relating to fruits and vegetables separately, these totals were summed to form a single variable, for example, parental intake, parental role-modeling, fruit and vegetable availability within the home and parental providing behaviour. Similarly, the two accessibility items were combined into a single item indicating whether both fruit and vegetables were stored in a ready-to-eat format or whether fruit, or vegetables, or both fruit and vegetables were not stored in this way. Consistent with previous research on Australian parents of preschoolers [33] parental education was dichotomised into 'university educated' and 'other', and annual household income was split into less than $100,000 and $100,000 or more. Categorical variables used to assess eating policies were recoded dichotomously, whereby "all of the time" and "most of the time" responses were combined to reflect consistent adoption of these policies, and "some of the time", "rarely" and "never" were also combined. Non-normal continuous variables (days per week the family eats dinner together at a table, days per week the child eats dinner in front of the television) were treated as dichotomous categorical variables. The cut points were set at the frequencies with which the highest levels of children's fruit and vegetable consumption have previously been associated [34-37]. Therefore the number of days per week the family eats dinner together at a table was split into 7 days and less than 7 days, and the number of days per week the child eats dinner in front of the television was split into 0 days and 1 or more days. Similarly, the location where most meals were eaten was recoded into 'table' and 'other' [38].
A series of simple regression models were run investigating the association between each characteristic of the home food environment and children's fruit and vegetable consumption. Simple regression models also investigated socio-demographic characteristics for which associations with children's fruit or vegetable intake had previously been found; parental education [10], household income [39], child gender [19] and child age [19]. As numerous simple regression models were being tested, a Bonferroni adjustment was applied to the p-value (0.003) to account for the increased likelihood of type one error [40]. As evidence suggests fruit and vegetable consumption varies between children attending different childcare centres [41], all regression analyses used generalised linear mixed models (Proc Mixed) with a random intercept term to adjust for the correlation of measurements within a preschool.
A screening criterion of p < 0.25 was adopted to determine which variables would be included in the multiple regression analysis. A criterion of p < 0.25 was used as evidence suggests that adopting the traditional threshold (p < 0.05) can exclude variables of known importance [42,43]. A backwards stepwise approach was used to determine the final multiple regression model with the least significant characteristic of the home food environment removed and the analysis re-run until only significant variables remained. Socio-demographic variables that satisfied the screening criterion (p < 0.25) were controlled for in the multiple regression model (i.e. they were included in the stepwise process and retained in the final model).
Results
The sample consisted of 396 parents, recruited from 30 preschools across the Hunter region. Of the 57 preschools within the sampling frame, 30 consented, 19 were ineligible, seven refused to participate and one could not be contacted. Children from approximately 2,200 families attended the 30 preschools, and 417 parents consented to participate, with a further 178 returning a form indicating that they did not consent to participate. Of the consenters, ten refused to participate when contacted to complete the survey, six were ineligible and five could not be contacted, resulting in a total of 396 parents providing data for the analysis. The study sample and the characteristics of their home food environments are described in Table 1.
There were no significant differences between participants and those non-consenters who returned a form with respect to child age, gender, daily serves of fruit or vegetables, or level of disadvantage based on residential postcode [44]. However, only a small proportion (approximately 10%) of the families who did not participate returned a completed consent form. In comparison with a regionally representative sample of children aged 2 to 4 years, a similar proportion of children in this study consumed at least one serve of fruit per day, but a higher proportion of children in the study consumed at least two serves of vegetables per day [45].
Most parents (99%) lived with their child 7 days a week and most (74%) reported that they were 'always' responsible for their child's meals and snacks, with 22% and 5% reporting they were responsible 'most of the time' and 'half of the time' respectively. Parents consumed an average of five serves of fruit and vegetables each day and consumption levels approximated that of female adults of a similar age within the region [45]. On average, parents ate fruit and vegetables in front of their children more than two occasions per day and provided their children with fruit and vegetables more than three times a day. While, on average, households had almost 22 different types of fruit and vegetables available in the house, fewer than half of those households (39%) kept both fruit and vegetables in a ready-to-eat, accessible format. On average, families ate together at a table 5.6 days a week (with 57% eating together 7 days a week) and children ate dinner in front of the television on an average of 2.2 days a week (with 47% not doing this at all, i.e. 0 days per week). The majority of families (87%) ate most meals at a table. Although 59% of parents indicated that they would restrict dessert 'most' or 'all of the time' when their child did not eat their dinner, 29% rewarded their child with dessert for finishing dinner. Only 4% of parents allowed their child to access snacks themselves.
The mean score for the fruit and vegetable subscale for children within the study was 14.8 (sd 4.6). Table 2 displays the strength of the associations between children's fruit and vegetable score and characteristics of the home food environment and socio-demographic characteristics in simple and multiple regression models.
Simple regression analysis found statistically significant positive associations (p < 0.003) between children's fruit and vegetable consumption and the following factors: parental fruit and vegetable intake; occasions per day where parents role-model fruit and vegetable consumption; provision of fruit or vegetables to children; variety of fruit and vegetables available in the home; keeping fruit and vegetables in a ready-to-eat format (e.g. washed and chopped); and only allowing children to eat at set meal times.
Twelve characteristics of the home food environment had a p-value less than 0.25 in the simple regression models and were entered into the backward stepwise regression along with parental education, household income and child gender. The assumptions of multiple regression were tested and found to be acceptable. The regression coefficients, 95% confidence intervals and p-values for the five significant variables (p < 0.05) that were retained in the final regression model are shown in the final two columns of Table 2.
Multiple regression analysis indicated that higher fruit and vegetable consumption in children was significantly associated with: higher fruit and vegetable intake in parents, more frequent provision of fruit and vegetables to children throughout the day, having a wider variety of fruits and vegetables available in the home, having fruit and vegetables stored in a ready-to-eat format, and generally only allowing children to eat at set mealtimes. These variables remained significant despite controlling for parental education, household income and the gender of the child. This model of the characteristics of the home food environments accounted for 48% of the variation in the child's fruit and vegetable score. The regression coefficients suggest that, all other factors held constant, each additional occasion that parents provide their children with fruit or vegetables throughout the day is associated with an average an increase in children's fruit and vegetable score of 1.80 points, and that ensuring that children generally only eat at set mealtimes is associated with an average increase of 1.00 points in the fruit and vegetable score. The coefficients of the remaining three significant variables within the model ranged from 0.12 to 0.90.
Discussion
This study is one of only a handful of studies examining associations between characteristics of the home food environment and the fruit and vegetable consumption of preschool-aged children, and among the first to investigate these relationships through multiple regression analysis and with a reliable and valid measure of fruit and vegetable intake. The study found that greater fruit and vegetable consumption in children was positively associated with parent's own fruit and vegetable consumption; the frequency with which parents provide these foods to their child; the availability and accessibility of these foods in the home; and with maintaining set mealtimes. Such findings provide insights into factors that influence young children's vegetable and fruit intake.
The positive association between child and parent fruit and vegetable intake is supported by studies involving preschool-aged children [19-21] as well as older children and adolescents [14,18,48,49] and supports previous recommendations that modification of parent diet be a key strategy for interventions targeting children's eating habits [5,19,21,38,46]. A lack of significant association between child fruit and vegetable intake and parental consumption of these foods in front of their children, however, suggests that the influence of parental role-modeling is complex [47,48]. Further research investigating the mechanisms by which parental intake may influence child consumption may yield important insights for intervention.
A unique aspect of this study was the examination of parental provision of fruit and vegetables as a correlate of child consumption. Although the reported positive association is somewhat intuitive for children of this age, the finding accentuates the critical role that parents play in facilitating fruit and vegetable consumption through provision of these foods. Within the study sample at least, the findings also suggest that there is considerable scope to further improve child fruit and vegetable intake through encouraging more frequent provision. On average, parents provided fruit or vegetables to their child on 3.2 occasions per day, with dinner being the most prevalent occasion for serving vegetables, and morning tea the most prevalent occasion for serving fruit. Given that it is recommended that children of this age have three meals and two to three small snacks daily [49], introducing fruit and vegetables at additional occasions throughout the day, particularly the provision of vegetables for morning or afternoon teas, could represent an effective intervention strategy. Further, the findings of this, and other studies with older children [50,51] demonstrate a greater likelihood for children to eat fruits and vegetable if they are stored at home in a ready-to-eat form. As preparation time is a commonly cited barrier to fruit and vegetable consumption [52,53], having ready-to-eat fruit and vegetables on hand may increase the likelihood of parents feeding their preschool child these foods rather than convenient, pre-packaged, snack foods. As only 39% of parents in this study reported storing fruit and vegetables in this way, strategies that make it easier for parents to purchase, prepare and store ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables are needed and likely to facilitate increased parent provision of these foods to their child.
These findings should be considered in the context of the study limitations. First, this data is cross-sectional, precluding conclusions regarding causality. Further research is warranted to determine if these associations are evident in longitudinal research, and if changes to such characteristics mediate the changes to child fruit and vegetable intake following intervention. Second, use of parent volunteers may have introduced selection-bias as study participants may not be representative of the broader population from which they were drawn. Compared to a random sample of 764 mothers of 2 to 5 year-olds in the broader study region, parents in this study were more educated (47% vs 36% with a university education) and from higher income households (41% vs 20% earning over $100,000 per year) [33] and their children had higher levels of vegetable consumption than a regionally representative sample of children aged 2 to 4 years [45]. The strength of the associations found in this study is therefore unknown among families from less advantaged backgrounds. Furthermore, most participants identified themselves as the parent that was primarily responsible for feeding their child, and only 4% of the participants were fathers, most likely due to fathers being less likely to drop children at childcare [54] and being less likely to have primary responsibility for food within the household [55]. This may restrict the generalisability of study findings to mothers, and the primary food provider, rather than parents more broadly. The inclusion of measures of the home food environment with unknown validity and reliability is a further limitation of this research and further research is required to develop and refine appropriate measures suitable for population-based investigation. Finally, this research examined the combined consumption of fruit and vegetables. The analyses did not allow for the identification of the relative associations of environmental characteristics with fruit and vegetable intake separately [56]. Future research should seek to address these limitations.
Conclusions
The study findings suggest that a range of factors within the home food environment appear to be associated with young children's fruit and vegetable intake. The final regression model which included parental intake and parental provision of fruit and vegetables to their children, the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables in the home and having set mealtimes accounted for almost half of the variation in children's fruit and vegetable consumption. Such results suggest that there are modifiable factors within the home environment that may be appropriate targets for future interventions aimed at increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in preschool-aged children to address this substantial public health problem.

Genetic variation in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is likely to be particularly important for phenotypes associated with function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), such as cognition (Dickinson and Elvevag, 2009). Neuroimaging studies confirm that the COMT Val158Met (rs4680) polymorphism affects human prefrontal cortical function, and as such is strongly associated with differences in neural process underlying cognitive output (Dennis et al., 2010; Mier et al., 2009). However, these findings do not necessarily imply any change in cognition. A recent meta-analysis observed no significant effect of the Val158Met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on frontal cognitive tasks (Barnett et al., 2008). Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that this association might be specific to developmental stage (Barnett et al., 2007; Dumontheil et al., 2011; Raz et al., 2011). Thus further examination of COMT genetic variation is required for a better understanding of its role in a wider range of cognitive functions during development.
Relatively little is known about the role of COMT in cognition in children (Diamond et al., 2004; Dumontheil et al., 2011), and specifically in relation to developmental stages, such as puberty (Barnett et al., 2007). The cognitive effects attributable to COMT activity may depend on developmental stage because structural and functional changes occur in the PFC during adolescence (Casey et al., 2000; De Luca et al., 2003; Rubia et al., 2000; Supekar et al., 2010); cognitive functions performed by the PFC in adults may be governed by different or more diffuse circuits in children. If so, then COMT variation may have little effect on cognitive performance during childhood, but a stronger effect in adolescence. Moreover, increases in the level of reproductive hormones such as estrogen during puberty can down-regulate COMT transcription and lead to a sex difference in COMT activity, and therefore to a different effect of COMT on cognition in boys and girls (Tunbridge, 2010). Among 8-year-old children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort Val158Met polymorphism was reported to have a larger effect on verbal IQ in pubertal children when compared with prepubertal children (Barnett et al., 2007). A recent study of 6–20-year-olds also suggests the role of development in the effect of COMT Val158Met polymorphism on working memory, specifically that visuospatial working memory capacity exhibited an age by genotype interaction, with a benefit of the Met allele (rs4680) emerging after 10 years of age (Dumontheil et al., 2011). However, these studies were cross-sectional in design, so did not investigate the genetic effect on cognition in the same children at different developmental stages.
Despite strong evidence for the biological importance of several COMT SNPs (Nackley et al., 2006) little is known about associations with cognition of any loci other than Val158Met. A functional three-SNP haplotype consists of Val158Met (rs4680) and two synonymous SNPs (rs6269 and rs4818): ValA/ValA, ValA/Met, ValA/ValB or Met/Met, ValB/Met, and ValB/ValB are diplotypes ranked from highest to lowest according to COMT enzyme activity. This haplotype exerts a major influence on the level of COMT expression and enzyme activity (Nackley et al., 2006) and has previously been shown to have a curvilinear association with measures of verbal inhibition and working memory (Barnett et al., 2009). Previous studies have also reported associations between rs165599 (located near the 3′UTR region) (Burdick et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2005), and rs737865 (located in intron 1) (Diaz-Asper et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2009) and cognitive function. These SNPs appear to be functional, with rs737865 G (=C) allele and rs165599 G (=C) allele being associated with lower expression of COMT mRNA in the human brain (Bray et al., 2003).
In the present study we include the Nackley's haplotype (rs6269–rs4818–rs4680) and the two functional SNPs, rs737865 and rs165599, to characterize better the combined effects of variation in the COMT gene on cognitive function. Using data from the British 1946 birth cohort we aimed: (1) to investigate the effect of the five COMT SNPs on cognitive function in the same boys and girls at two time-points (age 8 and 15 year follow-ups); (2) to test whether pubertal stage of cohort members established at the second assessment (age 15 years) modifies any observed associations.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) (also known as the British 1946 birth cohort) is a socially stratified birth cohort of 5362 individuals (2547 women and 2815 men), who have been followed up since their birth in 1946 with regular data collections (Wadsworth et al., 2003). Blood samples were collected from 2756 members at age 53 years. Every survey member with information on at least one cognitive test (phenotype indicator) at both age 8 and age 15 years and DNA genotyped for COMT SNPs was included in the descriptive analysis (n = 1029 boys and 1048 girls). Survey members with available DNA had higher cognitive scores on all cognitive tests at ages 8 and 15 years than those without genetic information; but were not different with respect to pubertal stage at age 15 years (p = 0.35) or social class of origin (p = 0.52). The results of comparing those with DNA and those without on cognitive tests measures are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
Ethical approval for this research was obtained from the North Thames Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee, and from relevant local research ethics committees in the survey areas. Informed consent was given by all respondents.
Children were assessed by teachers in a school setting at ages 8 and 15 years using tests devised by the National Foundation for Educational Research (Pigeon and Douglas, 1964; Pigeon et al., 1968). At age 8 years these were: (1) reading comprehension (selecting appropriate words to complete 35 sentences); (2) word reading (ability to read and pronounce 50 words); (3) vocabulary (ability to explain the meaning of the same 50 words); and (4) picture intelligence, consisting of a 60-item non-verbal reasoning test. At age 15 years these were: (1) Alice Heim Group Ability Test (AH4), a 130 item timed test, with separate verbal (analogies, comprehension, and numerical reasoning) and non-verbal (matching, spatial analysis, and non-verbal reasoning sections) tests; (2) The Watts-Vernon Reading Test, a test of reading comprehension requiring the participant to select appropriate words to complete 35 sentences; (3) A 47-item mathematics test, requiring the use of arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, and algebra.
All scores reported in the results were standardised within the sample included in this analysis to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
At age 15 years, pubertal development in boys was classified at school by a physician based on the development of genitalia, presence of pubic hair, axillary hair and voice broken. Those with infantile genitalia or early adolescent genitalia, but no pubic or axillary hair and voice not broken were classified as prepubescent, all others as pubescent. Age at menarche was used as the marker of pubertal stage for girls, and was obtained from mothers’ reports in 1961. This information was used to construct a binary variable for pubertal status distinguishing between those who had menarche by age 15 (pubescent) and those who did not (prepubescent). The majority of the participants (89% of boys and 90% of girls) had reached pubertal status by age 15.
DNA was extracted and purified from whole blood using the Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Flowgen, Leicestershire, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The five SNPs, rs737865, rs6269, rs4818, rs4680 and rs165599, were typed by using the KASPar system by KBioscience, UK (). The integrity of the genotyping was checked by genotyping frequency, concordance of duplicates and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The call rates for the genotyped SNPs were 97.8–99.2%, with >95% concordance between duplicate samples and there was no evidence of deviation from HWE (p > 0.05).
The programme PLINK v1.07 was used for haplotype analysis (Purcell et al., 2007). The haplotype frequencies (rs6269–rs4818–rs4680) were similar to those reported in the original paper (Nackley et al., 2006): GGG (=ValA)–40.8%, ACA (=Met)–50.8%, ACG (=ValB)–7.8%, all others–0.6%. The survey members were then assigned to one of six possible diplotypes (i.e., the pair of haplotypes) using a ‘phase’ option (Table 1): ValA/ValA, ValA/Met, ValA/ValB or Met/Met, ValB/Met, and ValB/ValB.
Of the five genotyped COMT SNPs, the central three, rs6269, rs4818 and rs4680, were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD): r2 = 0.72 for rs6269–rs4680 and rs4818–rs4680; and r2 = 0.97 for rs6269–rs4818. In contrast, the LD between the three SNPs in the haplotype block and the other two SNPs was low (all r2 < 0.38). We therefore chose to separately test associations between cognitive scores and rs737865 and rs165599 and with the three-SNP haplotype.
First, linear regression was used to test for associations between rs737865, rs165599 genotypes (under an additive model), the three-SNP haplotype and the cognitive measures. In addition, curvilinear regression was used to test for associations between the three-SNP haplotype and the cognitive measures. Analyses were performed separately for boys and girls, and the sex-by-genotype interaction term was fitted to test for sex differences. At age 15 years, analyses were also stratified by pubertal stage, and the puberty-by-genotype interaction term was fitted to test differences between pubertal and pre-pubertal groups.
The effect of COMT genotypes on global cognitive function in a longitudinal context was examined using structural equation modelling (SEM) (Schumacker and Lomax, 2004). Model estimation was performed with Mplus version 6 (Muthen and Muthen, 2007). The model fit was evaluated with recommended fit indices (Hu and Bentler, 1999): the Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the comparative fit index (CFI).
A graphical depiction of the model is shown in Fig. 2. The measurement part of the SEM model represents overall cognitive function at ages 8 and 15 years. The structural part includes direct paths from the COMT genotype to cognition at age 8 and age 15. We fitted the model using multiple group analysis (Byrne, 2004). In the final analytic model, the factor loadings of global cognition factors were constrained to be invariant across gender groups, whereas the path coefficients from COMT genotype to cognition were freely estimated.
The item intercepts were freely estimated in both groups because the main parameters of interest are path coefficients, hence invariance of factor loadings are sufficient (see (Gregorich, 2006), for a detailed discussion on level of measurement invariance). We performed the Wald χ2 test of parameter equalities for gender group differences in the structural regression paths.
Since SNPs associations were examined in multiple group SEM with cognition modelled as a latent variable, it was important to examine whether the measures of cognition were comparable across the gender groups (Byrne, 2004; Meredith, 1993). Two confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models with different degrees of measurement parameter restrictions were specified in order to assess the extent to which the validity of the comparison of path coefficients across groups held. The baseline model tested configural invariance where latent global cognition variable had the same number of factor indicators, i.e. same number of items representing specific test domains in male and female groups. In this model, the factor loadings across gender groups were freely estimated. This model was a prerequisite for testing the next step, the metric invariance, where the factor loadings were constrained to be equal across groups. The measurement invariance in factor loadings ensures that the global cognition construct has the same substantive meaning across gender groups, thus warranting valid comparison of regression path coefficients in the SEM model. Then model fit indices of the two models were compared to evaluate the degree of measurement invariance of the loading parameters in the models.
We used the same range of the above-mentioned fit indices to investigate models of measurement invariance. The restrictive model is preferred if the fit indices are not significantly inferior compared to that of the less restrictive model. In terms of the RMSEA, the change should be less than .015 (Chen, 2007). For CFI, the change should be less than .01 in CFI (Chen, 2007; Cheung and Rensvold, 2001). We also presented the TLI and Chi-square as overall tests for goodness of fit (Marsh et al., 1998).
A Bonferroni correction was applied in an attempt to address the issue of multiple testing. The total number of independent tests was 15 (two individual SNPs plus one haplotype in two gender groups at two ages plus three tests [two SNPs and one haplotype] for pubertal status at age 15 in boys only). We did not treat each cognitive test as independent as they were highly inter-correlated (r = 0.6–0.9). This approach to inferences on independent tests required that the conservative α-level of 0.0033 to be used as the significance level for robust inferences.
Descriptive statistics for the phenotype measures and genetic data, by sex, are presented in Table 1. The results of association analysis between the COMT SNPs and cognitive traits at age 8 and 15 years are presented separately for boys and girls in Table 2. There were no associations between rs737865, or rs165599 or diplotype and cognitive measures at age 8 years in either boys or girls. The regression analysis for cognition at age 15 years identified associations between rs737865 and AH4 verbal ability (β = −0.106, SE = 0.049, p = 0.031), and reading comprehension (β = −0.098, SE = 0.049, p = 0.044), but only in boys (Fig. 1). Boys with CC genotype had higher scores than those–carriers of T allele (both p's < 0.05). None of the findings survived p-value correction for multiple testing (α-level = 0.0033).
There were no associations between this SNP and level of cognitive functions in girls. Sex differences were tested by interaction terms but found not to be statistically significant at α-level of 0.0033: p for sex interaction = 0.13 and 0.09 for verbal ability and reading comprehension, respectively. There were no associations between diplotypes and any of the individual cognitive tests at age 15 years using linear (Table 2) or curvilinear (Supplementary Table 2) regression models.
The effect of pubertal stage on the associations between rs737865 and reading comprehension and verbal ability was then tested. In boys, we observed the similar effects of the SNP on verbal ability (β = −0.123, SE = 0.051, p = 0.016) and reading comprehension (β = −0.110, SE = 0.051, p = 0.031) in those who reached puberty by age 15 years. There were no associations between rs737865 and either verbal ability (β = 0.062, SE = 0.124, p = 0.62) or reading comprehension (β = −0.026, SE = 0.127, p = 0.84) in prepubescent boys. There was no statistically significant difference between prepubescent and pubescent groups: p-values for the puberty interaction tests were 0.18 and 0.17 for verbal ability and reading comprehension respectively.
We tested for the longitudinal effect of COMT rs737865, rs165599 and diplotype on cognition using SEM model for boys and girls (Fig. 2 for rs737865). Individual cognitive tests were modelled as components of global cognition at both ages. Results of modelling to test for measurement invariance of global cognitive measures showed that the less restrictive model demonstrated a good fit to the data (chi2 = 512.944, df = 34, CFI = 0.980, TLI = 0.968, RMSEA = 0.080). The second model with more restrictive equal factor loadings across gender groups showed even better fit indices due to model parsimony (chi2 = 560.089, df = 40, CFI = 0.979, TLI = 0.970, RMSEA = 0.076), supporting the invariance of factor loadings across gender groups. This provided a sufficient condition for comparison of the COMT SNP association with global cognitive measures across both genders. A multiple group SEM model was fitted with rs737865 as predictor of the global cognition (TLI = 0.971, CFI = 0.979, RMSEA = 0.065). The results of the SEM estimation suggested the effect of rs737865 on general cognition at age 15 in boys only (Table 3; Fig. 2), although the results of the Wald test for gender group differences in the structural regression paths were non-significant (χ2 = 2.19, p = 0.14).
Stratified analysis showed that the association between rs737865 and global cognition at age 15 was significant in pubescent (β = −0.11, SE = 0.05, p = 0.037), but not in prepubescent (β = −0.01, SE = 0.16, p = 0.96) boys, although the Wald test revealed that the differences by developmental stage were not statistically significant (χ2 = 0.34, p = 0.56).
The results of the SEMs for rs165599 and diplotype provided no evidence for the association with cognitive function at age 8 or 15 years (Table 3).
After correcting for multiple testing, the present study failed to demonstrate a significant effect of the five COMT SNPs on cognition in boys and girls at ages 8 and 15 years, providing little evidence that COMT variation can have an effect on cognitive abilities in childhood and adolescence.
However, several limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the present findings. Losses to follow-up and missing data are unavoidable in long running birth cohort studies such as the NSHD. There were differences in cognitive measures between those with DNA and those without DNA. This potentially could lead to underestimation of the effect of the COMT gene on cognition. However, that would be the case if the association operates differently in those with lower scores of cognitive abilities. We did not formally test for population stratification; however the 1946 birth cohort represents the general population of Britain of the middle of 20th century, which is of white Caucasian origin.
The strength of the study is its representative large sample. Yet, given the small number of prepubescent adolescents, there might still not be enough power to detect the small effect of the COMT individual SNPs or diplotypes in the groups stratified by pubertal status at age 15 years. In light of the possibility of the Type II error, the present results should be interpreted with caution. Indeed, the effect sizes of the original regressions were small (<1% of the common variance), and the results did not withstand correction for multiple testing.
Another strength of the study is the longitudinal analysis of the COMT gene in cognitive function using the SEM approach. The SEM approach allows for greater precision in phenotype measurement due to correction for measurement error in the cognitive outcomes, which may otherwise have reduced the statistical power to detect any robust associations with these genes (van der Sluis et al., 2012)
Before applying Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, only one COMT SNP, rs737865, was associated with verbal cognition in pubescent boys at age 15. Therefore, our finding did not confirm the results in the ALSPAC cohort showing a significant effect of COMT rs4680 on verbal IQ in pubescent boys (Barnett et al., 2007). The results of the analysis of COMT diplotypes on cognitive functions in children were not statistically significant and did not confirm the previous findings of curvilinear association between COMT diplotypes and cognition in ALSPAC cohort (Barnett et al., 2008).
We believe that testing for the effect of the COMT gene on various cognitive abilities is important for several reasons. It has been demonstrated that COMT protein has the strongest effect on the dopamine neurotransmission in the PFC, the brain region that plays an important role in a wide variety of cognitive functions, including cognitive control and IQ (Green et al., 2012). Moreover, performances on diverse tests of cognitive function tend to correlate; this underlying covariance represents general cognitive ability (‘g’). It is therefore logical that COMT could affect general intelligence as well as specific executive tasks (Duncan et al., 2000)
In our study, we were able to test the effect of the COMT gene on cognitive abilities at different developmental stages. It has been reported, that the heritability of general cognitive ability increases significantly and linearly from childhood through young adulthood (Haworth et al., 2010). In line with this observation, a recent study of 6–20-year-olds showed that visuospatial working memory capacity exhibited an age by genotype interaction with a benefit of the Met allele emerges during adolescence (Dumontheil et al., 2011).
The level of a reproductive hormone oestrogen, which down-regulates COMT transcription (Xie et al., 1999), increases during puberty in girls. This suggests that adolescence is an important developmental period, when the sex difference in COMT activity emerges (Xie et al., 1999), and the effect of COMT on cognitive abilities between boys and girls differentiates. Therefore, adolescence can be an important period when the sex difference in COMT activity emerges, and the effect of COMT on cognition between boys and girls differentiates. However, our study was not able to confirm the effect of COMT variation in adolescent girls or boys at age 15. It remains unclear whether the previously reported age-specific effect may be due to puberty. The puberty-by-gene interaction effects were not significant in boys, and there is a lack of power in our study since the group of prepubescent boys is small. On the other hand, many developmental changes may occur between ages 8 and 15 years, and young people are exposed to influences from many environmental factors. Therefore, we cannot exclude possible genotype-environment interaction on cognition. Recently, epigenetic mechanism for the interaction of the COMT with lifetime stress has been discovered: the greater stress led to lower methylation of the Val158 that was related to reduced cortical efficiency during a cognitive task (Ursini et al., 2011). Future studies will need to address these issues by employing longitudinal designs, using repeated measures of cognitive functions, and exploring the effects of specific DNA variants in interaction with environmental factors on trajectory of changes across cognitive development.
In conclusion, the present longitudinal study provides some evidence that COMT variation may affect cognitive function in a sex or developmental stage-specific manner. Further studies are necessary in order to make stronger conclusions.

Josh Anaya and Angelo Patino-Patroni make up the duo called PeaceTreaty. Many have heard (and love) them and their songs, but not many know where or how this group came about, including myself. How did these guys come to fame so quickly? How did they achieve those hard-hitting electro beats? And their original productions? Massive! So since, Florida has been blessed with PeaceTreaty's presence this week (this past Saturday in Orlando, and this Friday in Tallahassee), let's dive into the what makes up this unbelievable team.
From the depths of Chino Hills, CA, Josh Anaya discovered the greatness of the electronic music world in 2009, immediately starting production and playing at warehouse parties. Seeking advice from a high school friend, Angelo Patino, the two automatically became a pair. Armed and dangerous with not only a handful, but a sack full of music (originals and remixes), PeaceTreaty has exploded on the scene, with recognition from, most notably Steve Aoki, who signed them to Dim Mak Records.
PeaceTreaty believes that one of the last places that peace and unity can be found is on the dance floor, thus the name. Their music is featured in professional DJ sets all over the world and they are officially apart of the electronic movement in the U.S. Most recently, they have remixed R3hab, Moby, Diplo and Oliver Twizt, have done an EP for Sebastian Ingrosso's Refune Label and are preparing for a full-length album to be released this summer under Dim Mak. With their hands full, PeaceTreaty has nowhere to go but forward. Headlining shows and festivals and going on their own tour is just the beginning. The music I've included here is only a taste of what Friday night will have to offer.
PeaceTreaty will be in Tallahassee, FL this Friday, February 24th at Lit Nightclub (formerly 20/20). Don't miss out on this awesome Friday night show! Get tickets now!

Andrachne is a genus of flowering plants in the family Phyllanthaceae. It is one of eight genera in the tribe Poranthereae.1 Andrachne comprises 22 species. They are monoecious herbs or subshrubs, native to semideserts and desert margins of the Americas, southern Europe, North Africa, and South Asia.1 The genus Andrachne was established by Linnaeus in Species Plantarum in 1753.2 Linnaeus took the name from Theophrastus, but it is not clear what plant Theophrastus used the name for.3
The circumscription of the genus has varied since it was first established by Linnaeus. It was last revised by Vorontsova and Hoffmann in 2008.1 They recognized 22 species and divided Andrachne into two subgenera. Andrachne subgenus Phyllanthidea contains six species and its type species is Andrachne microphylla. Andrachne subgenus Andrachne contains 16 species and its type species is that of the genus, Andrachne telephioides.4 Vorontsova and Hoffmann segregated Pseudophyllanthus ovalis, Phyllanthopsis phyllanthoides, and Phyllanthopsis arida from Andrachne where many authors had placed them.
The names Eraclissa 5 and Telephioides 6 have been used for one or more species of Andrachne. Both of these names have been obsolete for many years.

Birmingham Conservation Trust
Birmingham Conservation Trust works to find imaginative and sustainable solutions for historic buildings in the City that are threatened with dereliction and decay. With its charitable status, the Trust can draw in funds from Lottery and other charitable trusts to tackle buildings no one else will touch and in the process create attractive places to work, live and play.
The Trust also has an educational remit to promote an understanding and awareness of Birmingham's architectural heritage. It does this through talks, lectures and running open days at relevant properties. In this way it remains close to the local communities, who have an interest in the buildings being restored.
The group is run by a board of trustees with a wide range of skills, who represent interest groups in the City and the City Council Planning Department. Once projects are completed any proceeds are ploughed back into future projects.
In recent years the Trust has:
Saved the last courtyard of Back to Backs in Birmingham.
In 2004 the Trust completed an exciting and ambitious scheme to rescue the last courtyard of Back to Backs in the city and secure their future. The Trust raised over .8 million and undertook a complete programme of repairs.
The buildings were then handed over to the National Trust who has taken on the long term management. The project, which featured in a five-part documentary by Carlton TV, has been an outstanding success, drawing in over 40,000 visitors in the first year, becoming a focus for community links and attracting a number of prestigious awards.
Completed a feasibility study for Perrott Folly, Edgbaston.
This magnificent seven story Grade II* listed 18th century tower had serious structural problems and needed a new use to secure its future maintenance. However, this is not an easy project as the rooms are small and the stairs are steep and difficult. Working with the local community, the Trust has completed a detailed study, which explored all available options. As an immediate result of the study, the Trust undertook emergency repairs.
Developed a scheme to open Newman Brothers Coffin Works to the public.
Newman Brothers is a most unusual survival of a Victorian coffin fittings factory, complete with all its machinery and much of its stock. In its heyday the company exported its goods across the world and their name is a byword for the highest quality coffin handles and shrouds.
Listed Grade II* by English Heritage in 2000, the factory was under serious threat of re-development but following an application from the Trust to Advantage West Midlands, the regional development agency bought the factory and agreed to fund Birmingham Conservation Trust to implement a mixed use scheme, whereby the most interesting parts would be opened to the public and the remaining areas converted into offices to generate income for the public parts. This is now the Trust major priority and is likely to costs approximately £2.5 million.
Improved the capacity of the Trust.
The Trust has continued to increase its capacity to undertake its challenging work. Not only has the Board has been strengthened by the introduction of several new active members with appropriate skills but staffing hours have also been increased.
Thanks to the huge publicity and success of the Back to Back project the Trust has been transformed from a relatively unknown organisation to one is recognised regionally and nationally.
The Trust website contains full information on all aspects of the trust work.
Priorities for the Future
- Continue to develop partnerships with local communities and other organisations in the City to facilitate the repair and renewal of buildings at risk
- Full develop and implement the Newman Brothers Coffin Works scheme
- Continue to raise awareness of the potential of the City buildings for re-use and regeneration
- Encourage access and enjoyment of Birmingham historic buildings by opening them to the public

WHO CAN GET A WINTER FUEL PAYMENT
People aged 60 or over and who are normally resident in the UK during the qualifying week in September in any year. There are a few circumstances where payment does not apply, for example, you were not resident in the UK during the qualifying week, you were resident in a care home, you were previously in hospital for 52 weeks as an inpatient, or you were subject to immigration control – if you are not sure whether or not you should be getting a Winter Fuel Payment you should consult either the Winter Fuel Payments Helpline or an independent advice agency.
HOW MUCH IS A WINTER FUEL PAYMENT
The rate of the Winter Fuel Payment is usually announced in the summer before the qualifying week in September. The payment is made at various rates between £125 - £400 depending on your circumstances. The payment is normally made either directly into your bank account or by cheque sent to your address.
If you are not sure which rate of Winter Fuel Payment you are entitled to, you should consult an experienced adviser. There are other payments that are only paid when the weather reaches a certain temperature, called Cold Weather Payments. These are made to people on some income related benefits during cold weather. If you think you should have received Cold Weather Payments, you should contact your pension centre or Jobcentre Plus.
HOW TO GET A WINTER FUEL PAYMENT
If you successfully claimed a Winter Fuel Payment in a previous year and your circumstances have not changed, you do not need to make a claim again.
If you think you may be entitled to a Winter Fuel Payment you should request an application form from the Winter Fuel Helpline 0845 9151515.
CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
It's important to tell the office that deals with your payments if:
- you move home
- someone moves into or out of your household
- you change your bank account details
- you stop getting benefits except Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit and Child Benefit
- there are any other change of circumstances.
This will ensure you continue to get the right payment and you are kept informed of any changes.
HELPLINE
The Winter Fuel Payments helpline is on 0845 9151515. You can use this helpline for any queries you have about Winter Fuel Payments, or to find out what is happening if you are expecting a payment and it is late.
PROBLEMS WITH PAYMENTS
If you have made a claim for a Winter Fuel Payment and do not get one, or get less than you think you should, you can challenge the decision which has been made on your claim. If you have not made a claim, you should get in touch with the Winter Fuel Payments helpline and ask for a formal decision to be made. Once you have a decision, you can ask the office to look at the decision again or you can appeal. If you are not happy with the service provided by the Winter Fuel Payments helpline or the Pension Service because of mistakes or delays or any other issue, you can complain. You can do this whether or not you also want to challenge a decision. You should also consult an independent advisor to assist you with this.

Now, if only they'd release an overclockable Ivybridge-E chip to go in their SR-X board, I'll be queuing up...
Asus and Gigabyte.... take note!!! This is how you build a loyal customer-base.
I'll be taking a closer look at them next time I go to upgrade.

I have had a couple of items slip the import VAT net in the past - but not many. Maybe worth the risk as you aren't losing anything - if you do get stung then you are paying the same price as you would over here anyway ;)
Hmmm. Didnt know that! Oh well. Stuck with rip off UK plc prices! When can I emigrate?
I love EVGA! EVGA FTW!
Sorry, just had to get that out of my system having seen that!
Ummm, how come I typed in "F-T-W" (Had to put in the dash otherwise it makes it Cheesecake for some reason LOL) and it came out as Cheesecake?
Thanks Brumgrunt and Bit-Tech for bringing this to my attention!
Yep, that's an awesome way to gain more customers.
Mine will be hand delivered :D
Having a good warranty goes a long way for me.
Yea plus postage and VAT / import duties.
More like WTF :'(
Then value the card less than £40 (who's to say you are wrong, it could be faulty, or presumed faulty). Though if the postman 'loses' it or it's damaged in transit, you won't be covered for more than £40. A risk perhaps worth taking, maybe not, since the warranty won't cover your shipper dropping it.
Also, assuming you have relatives in a place with cheaper stuff, you might visit them once in a while or vice versa. So carry it in the luggage, gift wrap it, and value it <£40 and chance your arm at 'nothing to declare'.
The net of the inland revenue is pretty lose, and you can often dodge it just by trying. I've even bought things from Thailand DDU (duty unpaid) and we've only paid taxes for it once out of a number of times.
If you think of the amount of times you've gone abroad with electronic kit in your bag (potentially expensive), who is to say it isn't brand new, or that you brought it with you to start with? The taxman is ruthless, but he isn't 'that' clever.

Exclusive Interviews
Exclusive | BJ Penn Transcript Part 4 | Rematching Tri-Star A Priority, "At The Time I Didn't Want Those Other Fights, I Wanted GSP After UFC 94" | UFC NEWS
Fans look forward to UFC 152 where Rory MacDonald faces the future Hall of Famer BJ Penn. They participate on Just Scrap Radio Episode 8 to ask the everlasting question on BJ Penn’s cardio. BJ explains the cardio issue can get complicated with over training and taking fights on short notice.
BJ Penn fan wrote on facebook: “Please ask BJ what he’s doing with his cardiovascular training? I’m a huge BJ Penn fan it’s hard to watch BJ in a lot of his fights because he can gas the 2nd round. His cardio was Couture like when he trained with Marinovich. Is there any chance he will go back to Marinovich training?”
BJ Penn:
“There has been some fights I’ve taken on short notice. I’ve come in there and I haven’t been in shape but a lot of the times – and no one is gonna buy this – the mistake I made is that I’ve worked out too much and I use all my energy by the time I get to the fight – I’m so burnt out from listening to 10 different coaches and listening to 10 different coaches argue with each other. The training camp starts and I can spar, I can go 10 rounds a couple of weeks before the fight I can’t even go the 1st round. That’s just different mistakes that everybody collectively as a team. It’s tough with a person from the outside to gauge what that guy is doing but if your fighter ends up going to a fight with an injury or over trained or whatever it maybe. A lot of coaches don’t want to take the blame but I would have to think that’s the coach’s fault.
You almost want to tell a guy when you hire them, because a lot of people they walk up to you all the time and they say ‘c’mon I can do this, this, this and I can make you so great and I can do this and that’ and I want to tell them ‘And if you don’t? And if you don’t and we fail – can you pay me? Can you give me the money that I’m going to lose?’ you know what I mean ‘why don’t we put your money as deposit? That’s how I feel about different coaches that come up to me and say ‘I can help you this and that’ I just want to tell em ‘If it doesn’t go as you say – you pay me whatever money that we lose – if something goes wrong. ’ I don’t know how many coaches will put their money on the line for that.
On another note talking about Marinovich, Marinovich is a great coach, great trainer. He knows how to train a lot of different sports and I definitely learned a lot from Marinovich over the time. A lot of people talk about those fights the Kenny Florian and Diego fights. And people ask different things, to tell you the truth that Kenny Florian fight was after the GSP fight and I was so embarrassed by the way everything went. One day I’m beating Sean Sherk and I’m the best fighter on the planet and I got a bad fight with GSP and everybody’s saying ‘ah, you’re making excuses. You aint good’ I was just so motivated coming out of the gates for that. I wanted to fight Kenny Florian, fight Diego. Dana White was taking to me about putting on another fight with GSP after the Diego fight. To tell you the truth I never wanted to fight Frankie Edgar, Matt Hughes, Jon Fitch and Nick Diaz. I wanted my revenge for UFC 94 when that all went down because that was big news at the time. I didn’t even want to fight those other fights. Those were just fights I was doing. I don’t even know why I was doing those fights. I was just fighting because I just hate to sit at home and sit on the couch but that’s just everything that happened. I’m not sitting here just obsessing about the whole thing with whatever controversy happened at the 94. Like I said that’s the past. I got nothing to say on that – all that is done at this point.
I got a lot of offers with other guys to fight but when I got the offer from Rory. I’m thinking ‘Good, I get to fight that brain of Tri-Star gym. ‘a lot of it is Faraz. They got a good thing going up there. They got a good team. They’re making a lot of waves. They’ve got St Pierre who’s going to go down as the greatest welterweight in history. They got another guy who they say ‘This is him. This is who’s going to be the champion.’ I don’t know – Like I said ‘I’m not thinking about any belts but I’m pretty good myself. I want to show them. I want to show the world that you’re not just gonna walking in and kick my butt for 4 rounds – no ways! You’re going to the hospital too. If I go to the hospital – you’re going to the hospital too.”
You hear fellow UFC Champion Jens Pulver in the background proudly saying “My boy, my boy” as BJ Penn finishes his sentence.

thanks for setting the record straight for all the critics
I don’t buy BJ’s reasoning for only winning 1 of his last 5 fights. If BJ wanted to avenge his loss to GSP, I don’t understand why BJ would be unmotivated to fight Fitch or Diaz. Cause if he wins against those two guys, he is next in line to fight GSP. So by that logic, why would BJ be motivated now to fight Rory? I just don’t believe it. Something else was and is going on. This makes no sense to me.
If I may, I’d like to give my take on all this. You see until UFC94, BJ had never been dominated like he was by GSP. Then GSP and Faraz came out afterwards and gloated about how they broke down BJ’s game and came up with a gameplan to beat him, including all the greasegate stuff and all. Just a bunch of poor sportsmanship in rubbing his nose in it and patting themselves on the back. Bullshit character moves. Now BJ being a warrior first and a fighter second, did not like what happened and wanted to rectify the mistakes made in his preparation for that fight. But there was no way White was going to allow BJ another GSP fight soon so he decided to beat up the 55ers for awhile and look to ww later.
Now he fights Edgar, how could anybody get up to fight Edgar at that time??? So then he takes a break and sees his chance to get back to the ww but White tells him he has to fight a few top guys. But he is in the later part of his career and wants GSP. I believe that he told us the truth and he wastn’t motivated to work hard to beat them. Let;s face it he was beating everyone of them until late rounds.
Now Rory challenges him and Rory is a big heir apparent to GSP. So it gives him a chance to beat not only Rory, but Faraz and GSP. He also knows that when he beats Rory, he is Condit, Kampmann away from GSP.
anyways that’s what I think….
It’s Firas not Faraz.
So he went to Welterweight, and knew that if he beat the contenders put before him who could get a shot at GSP but couldn’t get worked up to do it… But that if he beats Rory he is two fights away from another fight so that will motivate him? That makes as much sense as a healthy deep fried Mars Bar. It is illogical.
And for the record, at no stage in the Diaz fight was he winning that fight.
dude, he won the first round, go and watch the fight, he took Diaz to the ground and took his back! what are you talking about?

Power, agility and speed are the traits that many executives exemplify in solidifying deals that accelerate their business. This week several professionals who Black Enterprise identified as Intelligent Performers were invited down to Leeds, Alabama where they were honored for a broad range of business achievements. They also got to match their skills against the same characteristics that define the best in driving performance at the Porsche Sport Driving School.
The hilly and scenic 2.38 mile Barber Motorsport Park is home to the school and offers 16 turns and more than 80 feet of elevation changes. Guided and directed by a team of full-time instructors trained as professional racecar drivers, the 16 participants were challenged and exhilarated by the demands of the course, which included learning how to better manage turns, braking and accelerating, as well as how to avoid spinning out of control on wet surfaces.
Among those driving the 911 Carerra, the Cayenne and the Panamera included Larry Barkley, Senior Vice President of Retail, Tourneau; Matthew Carter, President, 4G, Sprint; Bart H. Williams, Partner, Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP; Kevin Warren, President, U.S. Solutions, Xerox; BE 100s CEOs Tilmon F. Brown, CEO & President, New Horizon Baking Company Inc.; R. Donahue Peebles, CEO & Chairman, The Peebles Corp.; Charles H. James III, Managing Owner, C. H. James Restaurant Holdings LLC, and artist, entrepreneur, philanthropist, head of Compound Entertainment, Shaffer “Ne-Yo” Smith.
Also along for the ride was the online winner of the Intelligent Performers competition JeFreda R. Brown, real estate agent with Keller Williams Realty in Birmingham, Alabama. For more information on how to sign up for classes, log on to.

By Aiyana Ma’at
One of the best things I’ve learned to do to get my feelings out (especially when I’m feeling a whole lot) when I’m upset with Ayize is this: Write A Love Letter. It may seem counterintuitive. I mean when you’re mad or disappointed who feels like writing a Love Letter, right? I certainly don’t…but it works so I do it anyway. So, just how does it work and what does it do? Well, it does 3 things.
#1 It helps me to release (and stop holding onto) all of the feelings I’m having.
If you’re anything like me you can hold a grudge like nobody’s business. When I’m mad…I’m not kinda mad. I’m UPSET and I can run through whatever happened, how wrong my husband is, and why i’m so upset a million times in my head…over and over. It’s not helpful and it sure ain’t healthy but it has become a habit (a bad one) and so to interrupt the vicious cycle of “I’m mad, I have a right to be mad, and let me tell you why” playing like a broken record in my head I write so that I can just put my feelings down on paper, get them out, and see them in front of me. There’s something about seeing your pain on paper that helps to bring perspective to whether or not a feeling is what I say it is or whether or not it goes deeper than that (meaning Ayize has kicked up something in me but the feeling really goes deeper than what he said or did.
#2 It allows my husband to really get into my heart and mind and understand my perception of the situation and where I’m coming from.
He usually can do that much easier when I write a Love Letter letter because he doesn’t have to deal with my tone of voice (which may not be the best and ultimately doesn’t help him understand me) or having to answer me right away. He can sit with what I’ve written for a little while so that he can give his best response instead of responding defensively or critically.
#3 It always and I mean always helps me to get beyond my anger and move to where and why I’m hurt.
It never fails I usually begin my letter with the feelings that are easier for me to identify: “I’m mad because…” I’m upset because…” but it’s not long before I begin to tap into the deeper places in my heart and my pen begins to write : ” I love you so much because…” or “I’m hurt because… ” or “I need you because…”
Plain and simple writing a Love Letter when you’re mad as hell is the way out of that hell of emotions and back into the love and peace that you really want and need. To find our loving feelings, many times we need to first feel all our negative feelings. Writing Love Letters automatically lessens the intensity of our negative feelings and allows us to more fully experience our positive feelings. Here are some guidelines for writing your Love Letter.
- Address the letter to your partner. Pretend that he or she is listening to you with love and understanding.
- Include all of the feelings you are feeling…anger, sadness, fear, regret, and then love.
- After each section, pause and notice the next feeling coming up. Write about that feeling.
- DO NOT stop your letter until you get to the love. Be patient and wait for the love to come out.
- Sign your name at the end. Take a few minutes to think about what you need or want. Write it in a P.S. For example, P.S. I need to know that you still enjoy being my friend and being with me like when we first got together. I want to spend more time together starting with a date this weekend.
Nothing happens on accident. If you’re reading this then you very likely need to get to writing!
And, don’t forget to write until you get to the L-O-V-E! Stop Playing Start Pushing.

Beauty sometimes have nothing to do with relation. The city of seance and the capacity of the brain is the matter. Be wise in your choice.
My hubby and I don’t happen to live in the same place right now. Was wondering if I could email my love thoughts wen am upset instead of writing it out and sending it in d mail.
I agree… I've always practiced this…when my feelings begin to overwhelm and I feel that my true feelings cannot be relayed verbally I always write letters… I've done it when in confrontations with friends and my significant other and it definitely helps me to gain perspective… but now with my next relationship I'll make sure to get to the L-O-V-E … thanks again… I just love the energy and advice you too bring… Much love and keep pushing
Baby that was beautiful. Almost as beautiful as you. Although you weren't writing this to or for me……while reading it I felt like I was sitting inside of your heart experience the simple things that make you and our love magic. I love you Queen.

With investigations of Tennessee, Auburn, Ohio State, and Oregon taking center stage, college football fans have been given many opportunities to comment on the NCAA and its enforcement procedures. Here on Black Shoe Diaries, we've covered the Buckeye compliance issues at great length.
Despite our best efforts, we know that we aren't experts in the field - at least not yet. To help us understand the complex business of compliance and enforcement, we reached out to a person who has extensive experience in the topic - John Infante.
John Infante is the assistant director of compliance at Colorado State University. While performing the same job at
Towson University Loyola Marymount, John anonymously ran Bylaw Blog, an unofficial/opinionated guide to NCAA compliance issues. John discontinued the blog after his identity was revealed, but the site was so highly regarded that the NCAA encouraged him to continue. Now, the NCAA hosts it on its own website.
John was gracious enough to let me pick his brain on a variety of topics - the role of a compliance department, the effect of social media on college athletics, the rise of 7-on-7 club teams, and "cost of attendance" scholarship reform. And for those of you who are (or have become) serious soccer fans, there's a special bonus question for you at the end.
Like conference expansion last season, compliance has been this off-season's hot topic, even though most people know very little about it. As a compliance officer, can you elaborate a bit on what a school's compliance office actually does and how big the staff normally is?
The job of the compliance office is two-fold. First, it must maintain institutional control over and monitor the school's athletic departments. Second, like every other part of athletics administration, it must support the programs to reach their goals. So in addition to the monitoring, educating, and penalizing that gets compliance in the news, there's also an aspect of advocacy where the compliance office fights for favorable interpretations and waivers. At the BCS level, typically the staff is 3-4 people, although there are departments with 8-12. Below that, two or three is normal, with some smaller schools still having only one full-time compliance officer.
How far does a school's compliance responsibility go? When does the NCAA step in and take a larger investigative role?
When an investigation goes beyond the standard look into a potential secondary violation, there's really three ways it can go. The first is that the institution largely does the investigative work in-house. This is relatively rare at this point, and oddly enough is seen only at the largest schools with the biggest offices. Running a major infractions investigation essentially doubles a compliance office's work. So most BCS schools choose the second option, which is to hire outside counsel.
The third option is to simply throw open the doors and allow the NCAA to come in and control the investigation. This is normally not required though because of the principle of institutional control. Ultimately the institution is responsible, so it's up to the institution to do a thorough investigation if it chooses to. The NCAA's enforcement staff and the Committee on Infractions decide what a thorough investigation is though. Even if the school does the legwork, the enforcement staff will still make sure it gets what it needs from the institution.
In recent history, we've seen investigations against power programs like USC, Tennessee, Auburn, Ohio State, Georgia Tech, and even newcomers like Boise State. Is the NCAA expanding their staff and the scope of their investigations? Or is this a particularly turbulent time in college sports?
I think it's less about the expansion of the staff as it is a philosophy change. The method of focusing on areas like agents or basketball or football clearly works. It allows the NCAA staff members to build the relationships, the sources, and the leads that ultimately lead to exposing programs and people that aren't following the rules.
But there are a lot of factors outside of the NCAA's office in Indianapolis that are helping to increase the number of schools facing investigation. Members of the media, most notably Dan Wetzel and Charles Robinson have their own relationships and their own sources. Social media has made it harder to keep anything beyond the smallest violations quiet. It all adds up to more leads and tips for the enforcement staff to follow.
How great of an impact has the rise of social media had on the NCAA rulebook? Are we regulating something that's nearly impossible to control?
It's changed the traditional definitions of how coaches contact recruits. It's harder to differentiate between a phone call, a text message, and a letter. The other problem is that change comes much quicker. When Facebook changed their messaging system, it didn't need to spread slowly. Every teenager adopted it immediately.
So regulating how coaches get in touch with recruits is getting impossible. You can still regulate when coaches speak to recruits, especially when they start, and that's the direction the recruiting bylaws will have to go in the future.
Does the compliance model we've laid out actually work? The NCAA is a fairly small operation, at least compared to the larger member schools like Penn State, Ohio State, Michigan, Texas, and Florida. If it doesn't have subpoena power, aren't we really just counting on schools to act in good faith?
One recent trend is the adoption of a more defensive stance by some member schools facing allegations. Until a few years ago, it was difficult for a school to put up a vigorous fight against major infractions allegations. The reason was that once you had to investigate a major infractions allegation, you could either stonewall or you could actually do the investigation. No school had the resources to do both.
Now with the growth of compliance staffs and the rise of outside counsel, it is possible for a school to comply with its obligation as an NCAA member to cooperate but still put up a strong defense against the charges. It has become the classic case of the private sector having more firepower than their regulators.
Simply expanding the NCAA's enforcement staff isn't necessarily the answer, because the enforcement model is based on institutional control. To really change the enforcement model, you would need to drop or deemphasize the idea of institutional control, and change the relationship between the members and the institutions. That would be long road, but it's one that at least deserves a look at this point.
When you talk about changing the relationship between member institutions and the NCAA, what do you mean? If we mean making the process more adversarial, how much are we at risk of the power conference members throwing up their hands and withdrawing in order to start their own league?
Just because the process wouldn't be based on institutional control doesn't mean there wouldn't be cooperation. A prosecutor and a defense attorney can still work together. All the NCAA members, especially those in the power conferences, want a more consistent enforcement process. If that requires it to be more adversarial, to define roles more clearly, that's what it will take.
How can we reform the system to make enforcement more effective? Is expanding the enforcement staff the answer? Or would it be better to consider rewriting the rulebook to focus exclusively on major violations?
Just expanding the enforcement staff is not the entire answer. That said, I don't think you'll find a single person in college athletics who says the NCAA has too many or even enough people on the enforcement staff. Expanding enforcement, both in numbers and in tactics, is one part of the puzzle. And the NCAA is doing so, with new positions being hired and more staff members out in the field.
The Division I Manual is certainly overdue for an overhaul. 99% of the college sports world can agree on some core concepts. There should be some academic requirement. There should be some limit on what the institution can pay players. There should be a way for recruits to not have their lives taken over by coaches. And there should be some limit on how much coaches are allowed to ask of athletes in terms of practice.
The trouble is that when you wipe out the existing rules and try to start from just those principles, getting almost 350 very different and fiercely independent schools to agree is very hard. So hard that it might not happen. So major changes in the rulebook are less about what those changes will be and more about which schools and sports will be in the highest level of college athletics when you're done.
You were recently a guest on a podcast with CBS Sports' Mike Norlander where the two of you discussed the loosely regulated AAU model. We've previously spoken here on BSD about the rise of 7-on-7 club teams. Do these teams and tournaments really pose the same kind of problems for football recruiting that they do for basketball recruiting, or are we making a mountain out of a molehill?
Long-term, I'm of the belief that 7-on-7 poses a greater threat for problems in its current state than AAU basketball. In the short term though there's one major limiting factor: it's not real football. AAU is not just real basketball, in some ways it is superior to high schools basketball since top players regularly play with and against other top players. Right now 7-on-7 is just another place where "third parties" might latch onto a recruit. But it's far from the only place that can happen.
What troubles me about 7-on-7 is that it represents the first step toward real club football. Having figured out how to get football players playing and visible during the offseason, the next step is to have them playing the real thing. The problem is the physical toll of football is too much to have both high school and club football. So while AAU basketball exists alongside high school basketball, I'm confident that club football will eventually replace high school football. And if that happens with no regulation or structure in place, it will be the Wild West.
With the 7-on-7 model still in its formative stages, is it possible for the NCAA (maybe in partnership with the NFL) to be the regulating body for club football?
That would be difficult. The NCAA isn't a youth sports organization, so it's not part of the NCAA's expertise to run a national youth or high school-aged football league. It's not in the NFL's wheelhouse either, unfortunately. And there's less chance of club football teams producing players that can jump to the NFL. The NFL and NCAA will need to be partners for a real national club football structure to exist, but their role is more to favor that structure in how they scout and select players rather than to actually run it.
You've spoken a bit about competitive equity, which is obviously a concern for programs in non-BCS leagues. In a related topic, several conferences have begun discussing increasing scholarship amounts to cover "cost of attendance." What kind of impact would this proposal have on teams in smaller leagues, or even smaller schools in the BCS conferences themselves?
The greatest impact is likely to be felt in Division I's "middle class," that is the schools you mentioned plus the FCS. The reason is that any proposal would be targeted at football, and a school that does not sponsor football doesn't have to come up with a quarter million dollars for one team. So non-football schools are well positioned to weather or even profit from these proposals.
It's hard to say what the impact will be without seeing a full proposal. There are five or six different ways to have cost-of-attendance scholarships, and the price tag varies wildly. That said, the impact on competitive equity is likely to be felt more in nonrevenue sports than in football or basketball. Schools will come up with the money for football, men's basketball, and any Title IX obligation that results. But whether they can find the money for baseball, soccer, and hockey is another story.
One look at Bylaw Blog's Twitter account and you know how passionate you are about soccer. Jurgen Klinsmann - best possible hire for the Men's National Team?
Absolutely, especially at this time. Klinsmann was always something of a dream hire because he has a European pedigree but understands the current American system and the American player. He's a not a miracle worker or a sure thing, but as US Soccer transitions to a more European development system with the US Soccer Development Academy league and the MLS academies, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who understands both and has senior national team management experience.
Thanks to John for all of his insight. He's full of information and a pleasure to speak with. Make sure you visit the Bylaw Blog () and follow him on Twitter (@BylawBlog).

TweetWorks Focuses Twitter on The Conversations
Tweetworks is another service that works on top of Twitter to try and make it just a little more useful for you. If you’ve ever tried to have a conversation with a group of people on Twitter, you may already know how hard it can be. There is a reply feature on Twitter, but you can only reply to one person. I’m sure you’ve seen tweets with seventeen different names included as “@” replies:
@aroundharlem @sistory @iluvblackwomen @soulpwr Check out my #blk group on Tweetworks!
You may even do this yourself. The problem is that everyone after @aroundharlem in the above example is not going to get the message under normal circumstances.
Groups and Threaded Conversations
This is where Tweetworks comes in. You can create and join groups around the topics that interest you. I created a #blk group that you can join as an example.
When you send a message to a group or reply to a message in a group, the message can also be sent out to Twitter as usual. It will include a link back to the original conversation. This allows anyone following you to click the link and join the discussion on Tweetworks. The conversations in Tweetworks are threaded, so it’s simple to follow what’s going on even when multiple people are involved.
In addition to posting to groups, you can also post public messages to Tweetworks to take advantage of it’s threading feature. You also have the option to moderate comments and give props by clicking the “BINGO!” star next to each comment.
Make Twitter Manageable
My mom recently informed me that she didn’t see the point of Twitter. The fact that the conversations had no context made it useless for her. Nobody was talking about anything interesting. Tweetworks makes Twitter more useful for those of us that are sometimes overwhelmed by things we don’t care about, AKA the noise. Just browse the groups, join one you like, and tweet away. You’re still participating on Twitter, but you’re only seeing what you want to see, having the discussions you want to have.Category: Social Networking, Trends, web 2.0 | Tags: #blck, tweetworks, twitter

Extract
Although published only from January 1911 through December 1917, The Masses was perhaps the American left's best-loved magazine, publishing some of the age's leading artists and writers. In an era when the American socialist press included hundreds of daily and weekly papers, published in the dozens of languages spoken by a largely immigrant working class, The Masses and the more agitational International Socialist Review were the party's most prominent magazines until they were suppressed during World War I. After a modest beginning as an earnest exponent of an evolutionary road to socialism, The Masses was re-launched in 1912 with Max Eastman as editor and a core of artists and writers who ran the magazine as a cooperative. They proudly proclaimed it “A Revolutionary and not a Reform Magazine; a Magazine with a Sense of Humor and no Respect for the Respectable.” The reborn Masses embodied a fusion of avant-garde artistic and literary sensibilities with a more radical but eclectic socialist approach. The magazine was lively and irreverent, illustrated by some of the leading artists of the day and publishing contributions by radical labor leaders and other activists, side by side with prominent writers such as Sherwood Anderson, Floyd Dell, John Reed , Carl Sandburg, and Mary Heaton Vorse. Many made their living in the commercial press, while contributing their more ... log in or subscribe to read full text

Sandwell District is Dead. I knew something was up when the former record label/collective tumblr site started a random string of posts on February 4th, 6th, 9th and the final on the 27th with the above photo. Each post was blank with a reduction in the name of the site name WhereNext? until ending in just ? Each building the anticipation for what was happening next? Maybe the label was being re-instated since Sandwell District called it quits on December 31st, 2011. That was their official ending of regular audio communications from the label. But still promised a few performances from Sandwell District Live (Regis + Function).
Since then there have been a few Sandwell District Live performances and the tumblr site has released semi-regular communications in the form of mix tapes, past interviews and audio clips, releases on Downwards, announcements of live performances and releases from SD members including some from Regis, Silent Servent, Function and the return of British Murder Boys (Regis + Surgeon), and of course the occasional photographic art.
So what does DEAD mean? Sandwell District was once dead before, a long time ago before it involved anyone besides Regis. It was reborn and became a prolific addition to the modern era of techno. Given the way the label has been go genius-ly loosely handled… who the fuck knows… and that’s what makes it great. Till next time Sandwell District.

Here’s our Best Music Podcast 2012 Part 2, focusing only on the second half of the year. Check out the Best Music Podcasts Part 1 for the first six months of 2012. To define our focus we like to concentrate on podcast series, not just one off mixes. Though as in part 1 we’ve added a new section at the bottom that includes free promotional dj mixes not available on a podcast series. We also ensure these are lasting mixes, ones that not only impress us on the first listen, but every listen throughout the year. We also will admit to possibly not listening to every music podcast from 2012, so if have some suggestions on sets that did not make it on the list, please – leave us a comment. These podcasts are ordered according to release date and podcast series.
This mix from Donato Dozzy, along with mixes from Svreca, Morphosis, Bill Kouligas and Peter Van Hoesen marked the end of a legacy. These were the final mixes from the MNML SSGS mix series as well as the blog itself, which found it’s way as a respected electronic music blog with a number of loyal readers over the years. Upon starting this mix I was expecting to hear the deep, beautiful, atmospheric techno the Italian producer is known for. What I found was delightfully unexpected and much more than I anticipated. This best music podcast 2012 is a mix of strictly hand drums vocals – and I’m a sucker for well crafted hand drum sets.
Untold is now known as one of the UK’s most vital DJs, producers and label managers. This made it onto the best music podcasts for 2012 because it’s a stellar mix with loads of outstanding recent techno cuts: none shining more than that of his own tracks, most notably ‘Motion The Dance’ and ‘Luminous’ from the Change In A Dynamic Environment series on his own Hemlock Recordings label.
Sit back and take a journey with this best music podcast of 2012. When you awake confused and disoriented and your recent memories seem like distant dreams you’ll know you’ve entered the mind of Vessel and seen just where this new project is headed musically.
Before hearing this live set from Decibel Festival 2012 I’d never heard of wndfrm, the experimental/ambient/minimalist sound from Portland’s Tim Wescott, yet I’ve been in awe of it ever since. It’s airy, atmospheric sound blended into dub techno is a perfect fit for Seattle’s annual festival of electronic music, performance, visual art and new media. Also check out the Headphone Commute – Decibel 2012 Showcase for a sample of more brilliant sounds from the festival this year.
Marcel Fengler may be my current top techno Dj. Which is saying quite a lot given he shares a residency at the legendary Berghain club with the likes of Marcel Dettmann and Ben Klock just to name a few. It really just comes down to Fengler’s taste in music. Every set I hear he’s playing the same techno and electronica tracks I just bought and even in this age of digital djing, syncing, auto beatmatching and midi controllers, it still is really just about the basics – what makes a good Dj is his passion, track selection and connect with the listener.
This mix from Ian Lehman on the podcast series from my good friends at Blank Code is a dangerous and diverse blend while staying true to techno purists. It made it to the best music podcast 2012 list simply because I connected with it more than any other on Blank Code’s dedicated weekly podcast. Speaking of dangerous and pure check out Blank Code’s latest release BCR003 Mutate – Circle 2 EP, probably their most soulful release as of yet.
I don’t need to say much about Adam X or the Electric Deluxe Podcast as I’ve written plenty about both throughout this blog and his Electric Deluxe Podcast from last year as ADMX-71 landed on our Best Music Podcasts 2011. I just love his taste and roots in industrial music as they mirror mine so closely.
As EPM perfectly stated “The Fear Ratio (AKA James Ruskin & Mark Broom) deliver a mix of twisted electronic genius.” This mix made it on the Best Music Podcasts 2012 because simply put, it’s a history lesson in electronic music - containing not only present day heavyweights such as Shed, Rob Hood and The Fear Ratio themselves but lots of gems from the Warp and Ninja Tune labels such as Aphex Twin, Autechre and Squarepusher. Mixing a generation of electronica and techno as well as hip hop from Gang Starr might prove to be a nightmare for a lesser experienced duo, but they pull it off beautifully making this an extremely memorable set.
I suspect Xhin let it all hang out whist playing for this hometown crowd in Singapore. This live Dj Mix can only be described as a new-age, digital speed garage as he blends segments of Depeche Mode and even Whitney Houston over a slew of electronic music genre’s while also tossing in the signature style of techno he has become known for. This mix is quite different from any I’ve heard from Xhin before and is eerily reminiscent of an early Dj Dan mix tape – with, of course, new sounds and flavors.

We’ve again compiled a short list for the Best Music Podcasts 2012. This being the first edition for 2012, focusing only on the best music podcasts in the first half of 2012. As with last year’s best music podcasts 2011, there are lots a great music podcast to choose. To define our focus we like to concentrate on podcast series, not just one off mixes. Though for 2012 we’ve added a new section at the bottom that includes free promotional dj mixes not available on a podcast series. We also ensure these are lasting mixes, ones that not only impress us on the first listen, but every listen throughout the year. That being said there are probably some great, bangin’ mixes out there from djs with loads of turntable skills. Sets that would sound amazing if we were seeing them live. But that’s not always what we’re going for here. These are dj mixes that we enjoy listening to, time and time again, at the office, on road trips and hanging out with friends. Hopefully this will give you a chance to discover you own hidden gems you may have missed in the first half of 2012. We also will not admit to listening to every music podcast from 2012, so if have some suggestions on sets that did not make it on the list, please – leave us a comment. These podcasts are ordered according to release date. Check out our Best Music Podcast 2012 Part 2.
Sawf is a local on the Perc Trax label and known for his stripped-down techno with punchy kicks and pounding bass. Check out his remix of Forward Strategy Group ‘Mandate‘ off the Labour Division EP2. You can see where he gets his aggressive style by listening to this podcast. I’m completely drawn to this mix and placed it on the Best Music Podcasts 2012 list because it takes me back to my electronic music roots. Sawf serves up dark industrial and EBM with the likes of Ministry and Nitzer Ebb. Plus he tosses in one of my favorite tracks of all time the Aphex Twin – Nine Inch Nails remix/rework ‘At The Heart Of It All’ – a beautiful fucking track. This is also one of my favorite podcast series because you never know what to expect. You hardly ever hear a set the dj would play live and the tracks always seem to mirror their early influences.
This Resident Advisor Podcast was the first I’d heard of Developer, a techno producer from L.A. and owner of the Modularz label, although he’s been a dj for 20 years. Yes he has been rocking the L.A. techno scene on and off for 2 decades but it wasn’t until last year when he created his own label and productions that he started receiving international attention. This mix is deeper techno, something that wouldn’t be uncommon from fellow L.A. techno icon and Sandwell District cohort Silent Servant, which is probably what caught my ear and landed this on the Best Music Podcats 2012 list. Developer does admit this is an unusual set for him and though he’d like to “do something different than my usual pounding 40 tracks per hour aggressive techno style.” Though the style does reflect that of his own productions and I believe he tossed in some of his unreleased material at the time.
This Resident Advisor Podcast also happened to be the first I’d heard of this artist. Airhead is a new talent from the UK, good friend and collaborator of James Blake and signed to the R&S label. This mix landed on the Best Podcasts 2012 list simply for it’s variety and freshness. It’s a fun mix to listen to. Airhead describes, “It’s a collection of some of my favorite music as well as some of my own work, roughly divided into three sections. I spent a fair amount of time trying to strike a balance between the more dance floor-oriented tracks and quieter moments.” I agree and you’ve done a nice job with that.
Dadub is a live techno act and sole mixing engineers for Lucy’s Stroboscopic Artifacts label. One of my absolute top labels currently. I love Dadub’s dubby, inventive and atmospheric approach to techno production and their unique signature found on all Stroboscopic Artifacts releases. Check out the Way to Moksha release for some of the most brilliant and thought provoking techno of 2012. This particular mix is not one of their live sets but it is definitely dubby and atmospheric and much more soothing and airy. I spent many sunny summer afternoon’s kicking it with his mix in the backyard which is why I think it is one of the best music podcasts of 2012.
ASC has been known as a drum n bass producer from the UK but in the last few years he has been pushing out perfected IDM styled techno. I think every ASC mix I hear is outstanding and this one is no exception. I listened to his RA.233 podcast from the end of 2010 for all of 2011. Every track in this set is an original except just one. This mix definitely pushes into much darker and harder territory then I’ve heard from ASC in the past.
This podcast came out just before Movement 2012, giving listeners an insightful preview to their scheduled performance at the Detroit electronic music festival. Project 313 is a duo of Detroit natives who have been putting in work djing and promoting across the Motor City for years and their production team has taken shape nicely. I’ve heard a few other Project 313 sets prior, but this one set me back and got me real excited for their set on Memorial Day. This mix starts out deep and atmospheric and builds to an energetic experience with several waves in between, just as any good set should. I felt their inspiration pouring out of this podcast and it spilled right over into their set at Movement which is how it landed on our Best Music Podcasts 2012. The duo behind this live production team also founded the Blank Code record label and run some of the best events currently in the mid-west. Their Scene parties have been bringing in some phenomenal international talent into Detroit and the Scene-Interface afterparty was one of the highlights of this years Movement festival.
Modifyer is great concept – an experimental collection that serves as a platform for artists. I like podcasts series that surprise me and that’s exactly why I love this one. This mix from Amir Alexander could have been chosen at random and given me the same satisfaction as toiling through each and every process part. This mix made the Best Music Podcasts 2012 because I can hardly stand hip hop these days. In fact I avoid it like overweight chicks in a gym class kickball team. This mix however is not that hip hop. This shit is classic. Plenty of old Outkast, Wu Tang, East Coast, West Coast, R&B and turntable skills.
I’ve not going to say much about this one. No need. Just listen and be prepared. O/V/R Live in one of the most infamous clubs in Berlin. If you don’t know, now you know.
This is a great live performance from Redshape and it exemplifies his music and style perfectly.

Raceweekends Blog
Navarra - Full Race Preview
A title showdown in the GT Pro-Cup class between the Belgium Audi Club Team WRT Audi R8 LMS trio of Stéphane Ortelli (MCO), Christopher Haase (DEU), Christopher Mies (DEU) and the Marc VDS Racing Team BMW drivers of Bas Leinders (BEL), Maxime Martin (BEL) and Markus Palttala (FIN), sees just three points between them as they go head to head for championship glory on Sunday 14th October.
In the Pro-Am Cup class there is no fewer than three Ferrari 458s gunning to be crowned 2012 champions. The AF Corse team of Louis Machiels (BEL) and Niek Hommerson (NED) have a slender three point advantage over the Vita4one Team Italy squad of Eugenio Amos (ITA), Giacomo Petrobelli (ITA) and Alessandro Bonacini (ITA). However, coming up on the rails after a strong 4th in class at the Nurburgring two weeks ago is the all-French SOFREV ASP trio of Jean-Luc Beaubelique, Ludovic Badey and Patrice Goueslard.
Anticipating the tension and excitement going to Navarra is Stéphane Ratel, Founder and CEO of SRO Motorsports Group, who said: “The final weekend of the 2012 Blancpain Endurance Series is all set to be a thrilling climax to a terrific season of close action throughout the classes. It is a testament to the series as a whole that we will probably not know the various title winners until the very closing stages of the race next Sunday.”
Keeping with the remarkable entry lists that have been seen in the Blancpain Endurance Series throughout 2012, the finale sees close to 50 cars on the provisional entry list with Audi, Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, McLaren, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin and Jaguar represented.

With the end of Spring rapidly approaching, the Cubs are going to have to make a couple roster moves to get the 40-man roster in line, with the expected additions of guys like Blake DeWitt, Joe Mather, Rodrigo Lopez, and possibly another reliever. Look for some things to happen in the next couple days.
- The baseball world went extension crazy over the last few days, with the two big ones being Giants starter Matt Cain (5 years, $112.5 million) and Reds first baseman Joey Votto (10 years, $225 million). Both deals, at first glance, look huge, particularly for extensions. But I think we’re seeing the combined impact of the new CBA’s obvious efforts to funnel more money to the big league payroll side, and of new/improved sources of revenue (e.g., TV deals). These deals, at this price level, is probably the new normal. Adjust expectations accordingly. As for the particular deals, the impacts are at once obvious (Votto stays in the division for a long time, Cain isn’t available for teams like the Cubs to bid on after this season), and hard to predict (does Cain being locked up make Matt Garza more expensive in trade? or less expensive, because he’s going to cost a whole lot to sign long term? are the Reds going to regret such a long, huge commitment to Votto? or was it necessary because of the Reds’ efforts to get a new TV deal and to keep fans happy?). By the way, that beautiful picture comes courtesy of The Father-in-Law on our Spring Training trip. Best guess? Votto was telling Rolen about his new contract.
- Carlos Marmol has changed the grip on his fastball, which is allowing him to get some sink. The velocity on his fastball isn’t what it once was, so the more movement Marmol can get on it – and the more he can command it – the better. That way, he isn’t always relying exclusively on his slider (which will make his slider all the more devastating). Marmol had a rough early Spring, but has been better of late. I don’t really read too much into either half of the Spring – instead, I see a guy who lost some movement on his slider last year, lost velocity on his fastball last year, and lost confidence in his ability to throw the fastball for a strike without getting blasted last year. I need to see those things change, and I can only see that when the regular season rolls around.
- Ian Stewart and Steve Clevenger will become tremendously less valuable assets on Thursday. They turn 27 and 26, respectively, that day. Too old. Dump ‘em while they still have value. Today or tomorrow.
- Dale Sveum isn’t into huge pump-up speeches, so he’s not really expecting to give one to the Cubs this week.
- Marlon Byrd says there’s nothing like being a Chicago Cub. I still like that guy.
- Kerry Wood says the Cubs are itching to get the season started. I still like that guy.
- Baseball Nation previews the 2012 Cubs, and it sounds like many previews you’ve heard before.
- 25 years ago today, the Cubs dumped seemingly washed up pitcher Dennis Eckersley on the A’s. Oops.
- You have another day to win a pair of free tickets to the Cubs’ April 12 game against the Brewers (hopefully a nice crew of BN’ers will be there). Details here.

“25 years ago today, the Cubs dumped seemingly washed up pitcher Dennis Eckersley on the A’s. Oops.”
I believe they did in response to Al Campanis’ comments on Night Line the night before…
I thought it was the same day?
Votto’s extension starts in two years after his contract is up? Or is it 8years added to his current contract? Either way, he’ll be 38years old at the least at contracts end ..no thanks
in 10 years, I think $22.5 a year for a 1st baseman is going to be Carlos Pena money. Either way, he becomes the Chipper Jones of the Reds – lots of value behind that.
The guys on MLB Network this morning were talking about how overpaid Cain is – in the past 5ish years Cain is 4 games under .500 while Lincecum is 26ish over. And that, my friends, is about the only time that wins and losses matter for a starting pitcher these days, when you can compare them to a teammate over a stretch of time.
If the Giants extend Timmy in the next to years they might just have to field a AAA since I’m sure Lincecum will expect to be the highest pitchers ever.
I wonder if they’re going to let Timmy walk, and extend bumgrarner instead.
It’s certainly possible. Timmy isn’t anywhere near the pitcher he once was, with a 91-92 fastball now instead of 94-95. And he’s already facing concerns over the longterm health of his arm, cause he said yesterday that he’s scrapping his slider because it puts too much stress on his arm. His frame just isn’t built to sustain a long pitching career, and I’m sure the giants have similar concerns
“And that, my friends, is about the only time that wins and losses matter for a starting pitcher these days, when you can compare them to a teammate over a stretch of time.”
-
I still don’t think they matter. If you go to only 3 years it’s Lincecum 13 over and Cain 9 over.
And neither pitcher is the same guy they were back in 2007 and 2008. Cain is definitely better now, and Lincecum is the same but I bet you can make an argument he’s declined a tad.
But I agree with him being overpaid. (Votto too).
And that is why you do your own research before you blabber everywhere. Cain has been pretty good, 2.97 ERA over the past 3 years.
I don’t think Votto is overpaid. 30 homers, .300/.400/.500 every year – those are solid numbers. That is certainly no worse than Fielder, although Fielder will give you better power numbers but a worse glove.
Votto is not overpaid now, and won’t be for a few years. The problem is that he’s a firstbaseman, and he cannot “age down” to some other position. And, good a hitter as he is now, he (probably) will not be this good a hitter towards the end of the contract. (If the NL has DHs by then, it will be less of an issue, obviously: he still [probably] will be above average.)
This might be one advantage of signing good-hitting SS, 2B and CFers to long term contracts: they can “age down” to other positions. However, you then have to make sure that they are good hitters relative to league average, not CF or middle-infield average!
These signings are pointing to the payrolls skyrocketing in the next few years. Soon a team will have 100M a year committed to 4/5 players. By next year Soriano will look like a steal
Or he’ll think he deserves MORE money!!!
We should probably lock up Castro for 10 years/100m ASAP.
nah, go whole hog and do 20/200
I think $40M or less locks up Castro for 5-7yrs (now, before he adds 20 homers to another. 300 hitting season)
Castro’s not dumb, he knows that he’ll be worth a ton when he hits free agency, and he’ll be what like 25-27. no way he signs an extension until at least a couple years into arbitration. any extension he signs will be minimum 100 mil guaranteed and that would probably still be a steal.
He’ll barely be 28/29 on a 6 year extension. He has 4 arbitration years (maybe 3) after this 2012 season, he’s not thinking about free agency. An extension now will guarantee him $20M-$30M for his arb years at the price of losing $10M or so on a couple free agent/club option years, that he can get back when he signs the blockbuster deal at age 28/29
I think you need to look at the Justin Upton and Andrew McCutchen type contracts to see what Castro should get…
Cameron Maybin and Elvis Andrus, too. I agree.
Andrus yes, but not Maybin’s contract (he’s not as good as Castro)
& the 6yrs $51M for McCutchen&Upton is too much for Castro imo. McCutchen played a full 3yrs as a power&rbi guy before signing ..Upton did sign his extension after only 2 seasons but he also had 41 homers & easy projectable 30 homer power
The number to lock up Castro now before he adds another AllStar type season to his resume is somewhere in between Andrus’ 3yrs/$14M but much lower than $51M over six years
I think it will be much closer to the $51M than you let on there. McCutchen is 3 years older than Castro and as such, his power should be there. I could see a 6 year $42M deal getting it done but probably closer to 6/48
Castro giving up a few dollars but also potentially becoming a free agent in the middle of his peak years.
The Al Campanis Nightline appearance came a few days later. It was on April 6, 1987.
For the kids at home that do not what this about:
And here’s a great piece from ESPN OTL (the only thing worth watching on ESPN)
The Adrian Gonzales contract has always looked awesome, but as more and more of these get signed….it’s starting to look amazing.
ya, he has to be pretty ticked off he left $75M on the table
and hes the best of the bunch in my opinion. (obvioulsy pujols is amazing, but his at his age, the deal is inexplicable)
Ian and Steve’s birthdays are tomorrow (4/5) so the are not baseball old yet
AHH! Correction imminent!
Like everyone here, part of me will always wish that I could have been a big leaguer. However, at 39, people describe Chipper Jones as if he’s a wizened old man. When I was 39, I got an award for being an outstanding *young* researcher. I think that I like my “middle age” coming in my late 40′s rather than my late 20′s, thanks!
Believe me, I want to punch myself in the face every time I refer to a player in his late 20s as “older.”
(The Stewart/Clevenger bit was obviously tongue-in-cheek.)
Haha Brett, you said you like guys…
Will see if Boston goes back to Oakland and asks for more compensation?
Bam.
Reading the constant convenient and even “relished” predictions be baseball people about the Cubs I wonder if a Gomer Pyle; SURPRISE, SURPRISE, SURPRISE might be in order, maybe served with some special baseball “mustard”. I recalled that SD, SF and AZ had similar prognostications and then September rolled around suddenly the world said HOW?
Maybe it just is I have competed in my youth and know how much difference great coaching and preparation has when previous your coaching corps simply sucked. It is like a pin ball machine as players come prepared and compete in preparation instead of mailing it in. Reading the article quoting Woody about defense and then seeing what Borzy is doing with the catching corps and how McKay is taking on the Cubs piss poor baserunning and defense positioning only good things will result. The other big deal was Sveum a former SS protege taking Castro under his personal project and working on his defense and overall approach to the game. Finally yesterday’s revelation about using technology and statistics regarding situational hitting….
Now the team must stay healthy and actually perform but I think this might be a surprising year. Can this all be served with a tomato, pickle and some onions as well?
I agree, Ivy Walls. I’ve been saying it on here quite a bit. I don’t expect them to make the playoffs, but I expect them to exceed current expectations. Why? For the same reasons you stated above. The management of this team is different from years past, and I think that’s worth at least 5 wins above what people are expecting. I also think we have guys like Barney and LaHair, who people write off, who could make a major impact on the team. Plus if Soriano, Soto, and Stewart have better than average seasons, our lineup is not as woeful as people expect. But most importantly, I think we have a solid pitching staff (recognizing question marks in the bullpen). I’ll say it again: 75-80 wins.
A related side question: if you *knew* the Cubs, trying their hardest and performing their best, could win only 80 games this year, would you rather they did that, or would you rather they won, like, 50 games, and were a nightmarish pile of awful?
If they win 80 games at least you know there is something to build around. But, if they were the Astros, and only won 50 games, do you really want to build around any part of a team like that? I think I know where your going with your premise though. You would be drafting number one and have more money available in the new CBA for signing the drafted players.
Brett,
Here is the catch on that question.
It is easy to say that a 50 win team is actually a better outcome than an 80 win team with the improved drafting position. That is true.
That said, for the Cubs to win 80 or more games will require that a number of players who have really not performed in the past will break out. Guys like Samardzja, Stewart, and Volstad are the prime candidates. Other guys like LaHair, Soto, Barney, Soriano, Byrd, Marmol (well, I guess everyone really) would certainly improve their value with big season, whether of the break out or bounce back variety.
So, if the Cubs win 81 games this year, I am pretty sure that we will be feeling pretty good about a handful of positions that we have some pretty big question marks at this point.
In other words, a 50 win team would be fine in that it would bring a nice draft pick, possibly a real future superstar. That said, I will take some certainty from guys like Shark, Volstad, Stewart, etc heading into 2013.
I think that’s an excellent point (and, for what it’s worth, I have no preconceived answer to the question – I merely wanted to ask…).
I don’t think I’d ever enjoy seeing them be nightmarishly awful. I understand there are collateral benefits to placing at the bottom, but I think we have the money and resources to rebuild without that kind of embarrassment. I’d prefer to see a culture of winning institutionalized regardless of the talent limitations. I think that’s better for the long-term health of the organization. If they lose, and lose bad, how many guys with potential lose faith? How does it affect a rising star like Castro? Does he start thinking he’s better off somewhere else? Maybe he requests to be traded from the laughingstock of a team. Hope goes a lot further than hopelessness. I don’t like the idea of shooting for the bottom for some draft positions and money.
I would be interested to see what Theo & Jed would do with early draft picks. However, that could be accomplished with 70 wins!
You always try to win as many games as possible. If you aren’t trying every single day, you should get out of the league.
Nuts, as I said a HOF coach told me simply, “the ONLY thing a team learns from losing is how to lose.” Winning is infectious as is losing. Plus in MLB winning breeds value, how much is Garza, LaHair, Soto and possibly (hope against hope) Soriano if the team is surprisingly competitive than if they plummet to Astroland? Forget the draft choice positions, how many players make to the ML’s who were not number one draft picks—-show me development and show me capability and I will show you a good team.
Well said.
“I’ll say it again: 75-80 wins.”
On that note, ESPN summarized their 30 “over/under” polls, where people voted on whether Arizona … Washington would finish with more or fewer wins than ZIPs projects. For 25 of 30 teams, the fans said that ZIPs underestimated the wins! (The Cubs were one of 5 for whom the majority said “fewer,” with a projection of 71.5 wins) Of course, approximately half the teams will win more games and approximately half will win fewer.
It will be interesting to see if the “pessimist” fans (Cubs, Mets, Astros, O’s and Rockies) are actually “realist” fans, or whether fans basically are right about half the time.
“25 years ago today, the Cubs dumped seemingly washed up pitcher Dennis Eckersley on the A’s. Oops.”
It wasn’t that he was washed up, he needed to dry out. He probably wasn’t going to do it unless something drastic happened like getting traded for a non-prospect outfielder. The Cubs did themselves and him a huge favor.
Votto is a great player but that extension is just stupid, not as bad as the Prince contract but close. Why not have him motivated thru next year and if he leaves so what, as he’ll be 30…
On Opening Day we get Bill Murray throwing out the first pitch (not a bad choice) and Wayne Messmer signing the National Anthem. Wayne Messmer?
Come on Cubs, you can’t do better than Wayne Messmer, who we have to endure during most of the regular season as it is? How much you wanna bet he brings his wife along and they sing a duet?
Even a local American Idol contestant would have been more entertaining to help fuel the Opening Day festivities! How about Jim Cornelison for a day?
Wayne Messmer? I mean come on. Geez !
I must disagree with you. Messmer does a great rendition of the National Anthem.

Sunday 24 April 2011: One way
It was like walking through a zombie movie
Shops, with entire walls missing. The stock inside untouched like the humans have just been wiped out.
Buildings with no front wall showing a window into the life that went on inside.
Shoe boxes stacked in racks in a shoe shop storeroom
A desk covered in paper work abandoned in a 3 walled office.
We went for a drive through the city to explore
Arriving at the cordon, it was busy, but eerily quiet.
The street damage, while bad, was pretty much as I expected, as was the shop damage,
but the sheer scale of the job ahead was humbling
What did catch me by surprise was the number of large buildings that appear on a lean, or sunk in the middle.
There are a number of the big buildings which look like they will have to come down
The army guys on the cordon said they have been given the expectation that volunteers will be need until October to staff the cordon
Having seen the clean up job ahead, there is a lot to be done for October.

Tuesday 10 May 2011: How to sacrifice.
In 1973 it was my english teacher Mr. van der Welle, who introduced me to the world of photography. He showed us (during class) a slide from a stream in Scotland (Speyside). In wintertime, taken from mid stream. Naked, as he did not bring any dry clothes with him.
Not completely satisfied with the result. Will try it tomorrow once more.

turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace (Cameron Diaz). Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael; she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight -- and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes (Rupert Everett), a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

To escape a band of Ogami mercenaries, Dylan Hunt (Kevin Sorbo) is forced to hijack a tour ship. At first, feisty female tour guide Molly Noguchi (Kristin Lehman) harbors an intense dislike for Hunt, but before long she has willingly (and, it might be whispered, lovingly) joined forces with him. Meanwhile, Trance (Laura Bertram) undergoes a mysterious metamorphosis which also profoundly affects Harper (Gordon Michael Woolvett); and in their efforts to locate the missing Hunt, Tyr (Keith Hamilton Cobb) and Rommie (Lexa Doig) haggle with Tyr's old crony Ferahr (Dave Ward) -- who may or may not be in cahoots with the Ogami. "Lava and Rockets" originally aired on February 4, 2002. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi

2. There is no “one-size fits all” social media strategy.
3. Diving into social media without a strategy is like being on whitewater raft without a paddle. It’s probably not going to end well.
4. Crises happen everyday. Expect it will happen to you and your brand. Plan accordingly.
5. Social media doesn’t clock in at 9 a.m. and clock out at 5 p.m. It’s a 24/7 affair.
6. Social media success doesn’t happen overnight. It takes a lot of hard work, time and effort before you see any real noticeable gains.
7. Anyone who tells you that managing a social media account is going to be easy is lying. Run as far away from them as possible.
8. Yes, you can calculate the ROI of your social media efforts. Yes, you need to.
9. Numbers matter. Anyone, who tells you otherwise, just hasn’t found the right ones to measure yet.
10. There’s only so much you can learn from case studies. At some point, you just have to take the plunge and start applying what you learn.
11. Creativity is what separates the good social media pros from the bad ones.
12. Avoid the social media shiny object syndrome. New sites are created everyday. You don’t need to be on every site. Focus on the ones that add value for either you or your brand.
13. Social media burnout is real. Make sure to unplug every now and then. (such as when you are on vacation).

15. Social media is NOT a popularity contest. Being popular just means that you have lots of friends.
16. Instead, strive to be influential. Influence means you can persuade people to do something. That’s hundred times more meaningful than being popular.
17. There’s a big difference between being authentic and personable and being personal on social media sites. Know the difference.
18. Be true to yourself and/or your brand. You can’t fake an authentic dialogue.
19. Every post, tweet, status update, video, etc, should add some sort of value or contribute to your overall goals. If they don’t, it is time to rethink you strategy.
20. Just because it’s on Twitter trending topics, doesn’t mean it’s true. I’ve lost count of the number of celebrities that have allegedly died on Twitter that are still alive and thriving.
21. It’s crucial to think two steps ahead. Are you building a strong enough presence from the get-go? Would you lose everything if Facebook were to disappear tomorrow?

Be A TravelHero
When you book a holiday on the Internet, you’re constantly faced with a battle of endless offers, flashy advertising and great deal announcements. I think most travel sites aren’t very useful or user friendly and a waste of time.
However, having said that, there’s some good ones out there too, like Travelhero.com for instance. Travelhero helps you find hotels online and provides plenty of discount offers. Arranging a hotel reservation is made easy on their web site, allowing you to pick the best options and set yourself up for a great trip or holiday. No matter where you going, you can search for flights, hotels and even car rentals. Very well put together to save you a lot of time and hassle!

This morning it's eight degrees and snowing -- and the Mystery Woman just left with her 89-year-old mother for a check-up.
Roads are slick.
And they prefer I stay home with the dog. It seems I scream a lot in the car.
Yesterday, we had to drive across town to visit a different clinic. For the first time, I got to see the industrial strength of winter. Parking lots look like ice rinks or pools of toxic waste. Arthritis comes easy. True story: A TV reporter strapped on skates and played in the street.
We ate lunch at Chili's, which was decorated with Chilympiad stuff. Naturally, I tried to get a discount from the waitress, claiming to be the their only customer who had actually gotten drunk in Terlingua. "Nice try, old timer," she said.
In this order, we’ve had snow, snow, snow, rain, a little sleet, more snow, even more. The wind chill is serious. Minus 30 tonight. That plays hell with clean up. Ice becomes iron and is forged to the minor streets and major sidewalks. Major thoroughfares, however, are mostly clear.
This morning, I read a neat thing in the paper. They say if you toss a pan of hot water in the air, it will freeze before it hits the ground. (Didn't work.) In Texas summers, we reverse the ritual by frying eggs on sidewalks. (That doesn't work, either.)
Dog trainers advise against buying a winter puppy from the Midwest. They claim the dogs will never again go outside to answer nature’s call.
True story.
But still, I kinda like it. Locals nod knowingly and whisper to each other something about my attitude next March.
It could be worse. I could have voted for Dick Cheney.

It's going to get up to 20 degrees by Monday. It'll feel like the orange groves of Florida.

Throwing a cup of water or coffee in the air to freeze does work, but it needs to be colder...way below zero. Watch Jonathan on KARE11 weather...he likes to do that trick in the backyard. He might also demonstrate the banana-hammer by driving a nail with a banana that has frozen outside.
I'll tell you what could be worse, George...you could BE Dick Cheney. Of course, you two do share the possession of bionically regenerated tickers. But given that you have a conscience and a decent soul you'd have a hard time living with yourself, cold weather or hot.
Years ago, during the midst of a really hot Texas summer, my sons and I decided to see if an egg really would fry on the sidewalk. It wasn't immediate, but within two hours, the egg did cook all the way through. We moms of boys know these things... Denise

Grading the Coaching Hires: Mark Stoops and Kentucky
If I’ve learned one thing in my years covering college football, it’s that every coaching hire has to be evaluated differently. What might be a home-run selection at one school could be a dud at another; a guy who might be a perfect fit at one place could be a disaster somewhere else. Every coach, and- most importantly- every job is fundamentally different, and they need to be treated as such when evaluating these coaching hires.
And in essence, what I was really trying to say with that very long-winded opening paragraph was as follows: I like the Mark Stoops hire at Kentucky. A lot.
No, he might not have the huge name or sparkling resume of some of the other SEC hires this off-season, but at a school that is simply looking for hope and a reason to show up at the stadium, Stoops is exactly what Kentucky needed. He is young and energetic and will pump life into a football program that desperately needs it.
Of course while hope and energy are good in the short-term, in the long-term the question now becomes this: Will Stoops be able to win enough football games at one of the toughest places to do so in college football?
Let’s take a look.
Why We Like The Hire:
Simply put, Stoops resume speaks for itself. As most everyone knows by now, Stoops has spent time as an assistant at Miami and as defensive coordinator at Arizona and Florida State, with the one common denominator in all his stops being that his defenses have flourished.
And to his credit, Stoops’ defenses have only gotten better of late. In 2011 Florida State ranked No. 4 in total defense and this past season only Alabama gave up fewer yards than the Seminoles did. And before anyone says that it had little to do with Stoops and everything to do with the talent in Tallahassee, remember this: Florida State ranked 108th nationally the year prior to his arrival.
Even talented players need to developed, and Stoops seems capable of that.
Beyond that, what particularly appealed to me about this hire is that Stoops actually knows the area he’ll be coaching in. Kentucky isn’t an easy place to recruit and the SEC isn’t an easy place to coach, which is why I was never really a fan of bringing someone from outside the Southeast (mainly Gary Andersen or Mike MacIntyre) to try and tackle this job.
Well instead of taking either of those guys or anyone else, they instead a guy Midwest roots (the Stoops family is from Ohio) but Southeast ties, making him the best of both worlds from a coaching and recruiting standpoint. More importantly with so many coaching stops around college football, Stoops can and has put together a staff that is as competitive as any in this conference.
Remember when I mentioned this hire above? Yeah, I wasn’t lying.
Why We Don’t Like the Hire:
What it all boils down to is what you already know: Stoops has never been a head coach. Anywhere. That’s a scary proposition no matter who you hire, and regardless of what school you’re hiring him to. But to do it at one of the toughest jobs, in college football’s toughest conference makes it that much tougher.
So really, the questions now with Stoops are more abstract than anything tangible. We know who Stoops has hired as his assistants, we know (relatively) what kind of offenses and defense Kentucky will run and we know what his recruiting plan is too. What we don’t know is how he’ll handle the responsibilities off the field, not to mention the split-second decisions on the field which could be the difference between victory and defeat.
As much as I like the hire, there are still plenty of questions which surround Stoops and Kentucky.
What Kind of Talent Does He Inherit?
Hmm, the short answer is “not much.” Talent is something Kentucky has never had a bounty of at any point in their football history, and it was in especially short demand in 2012 when they finished last in the SEC in scoring (just 17.9 per game) and gave up the second most points on defense in the conference as well (31 per game). It also doesn’t help that the Wildcats will also lose their best overall playmaker (wide receiver La’Rod King) and only player to make either the All-SEC first or second team (offensive lineman Larry Warford) to graduation this off-season as well.
Still, of the few players who did make an impact on the field in 2012, most do return. The Wildcats return four of their top five leading tacklers on defense (including all three starting linebackers) and plenty of guys who got touches at wide receiver and running back.
Of all the players who return to Lexington though, what’ll be most interesting to see is how Stoops handles the quarterback derby. Maxwell Smith, Jalen Whitlow and Patrick Towles all took at least 40 snaps this past season, and all three return in 2013.
There’s an old saying that goes “If you have two quarterbacks, you have none at all.” So what happens if you’ve got three?
It’s something Stoops will need to address right away.
Yeah, But Can He Recruit?
The short answer here is that I’m a little more dubious than most. Stoops was known as an avid recruiter at Florida State, except, relatively speaking, what does that mean? After all, it isn’t all that hard to recruit to Florida State; the tradition speaks for itself, the school has more resources than any in the ACC and Jimbo Fisher himself is a monster recruiter in his own right. So was Stoops really that good a recruiter? Or was his success just a byproduct of where he was recruiting to?
Of course while I am dubious about Stoops’ recruiting ability, what I will give him credit for is this: Whether he can actually get players or not, only time will tell. But at the very least, he does have a plan to be successful.
For one, that plan starts in Ohio where there’s a ton of high school talent, but is also a place that former head coach Joker Phillips and his staff never seemed to emphasize in their recruiting efforts. Well to his credit, the Stoops name still carries a lot of weight in Ohio (Stoops’ father is a legendary high school coach there) and from Day 1, Mark has taken advantage of that. Kentucky has already offered a number of the state’s top players, including a handful of elite juniors.
More importantly, Stoops has loaded up his staff with guys who can recruit too. New defensive coordinator D.J. Eliot comes with Stoops from Tallahassee, where he was known as a monster recruiter, but was also the point-person in the recruitment of last year’s No. 1 overall high school player Mario Edwards Jr.
Also, the was one other assistant coaching hire which caught my eye as well: New defensive line coach Jimmy Brumbaugh is coming to Kentucky straight from a Mississippi junior college.
That seems like a bizarre move... unless Stoops plans on hitting the junior college ranks hard to find talent.
Final Thoughts:
Admittedly, when Stoops was hired by Kentucky, my biggest concern was that he would essentially try to turn the program into “Florida State Light.” That he would take the blueprint which made Florida State successful in his time at Tallahassee, and try to follow it to a tee in Lexington.
And it would’ve been a disaster. Kentucky isn’t, nor ever will be Florida State, and should never be treated as such.
That’s also why it’s been so refreshing to see Stoops come to Lexington with a plan completely unique to this particular school and this particular job. We all know what he and Eliot will do on defense, and Stoops also brought in Neil Brown from Texas Tech to run a fun and exciting offense as well. In recruiting, the emphasis seems to be exactly where it should be: Stocking the roster from Ohio high schools, and filling in the blanks via the junior college ranks.
Factor it all in, and I think this was a grand-slam hire for Kentucky.
Stoops might not have been a great fit at every school, but relative to what Kentucky wanted and what Kentucky needed, he was just about perfect for them.
Final Grade: A-

Over 300 people entered our Blog Your Way to the North Pole contest, with more than 44,000 throwing their support behind their 5 favorite entrants.
February 22, 2011 - Congratulations to Giovanni Savaglio. After an enthusiastic and heated contest, he is now Quark's Official Blogger to the North Pole.
Hans Lagerweij, president of Quark Expeditions, was on the selection committee. He commented, "Giovanni touched me with his thought that the unexpected is part of polar travel. That is so true!" Author, professional travel blogger, and selection committee member, Chris Epting, chose Giovanni because of "his earthiness, honesty and ability to paint a picture with words."
We congratulate all the competitors. The competition was keenly contested by many talented bloggers. We thank all who voted for their favorite top 5.
The 20th anniversary North Pole Expedition
Since 1991, Quark Expeditions has specialized in expedition cruising to the Arctic and Antarctica, in ships with ice-strengthened hulls or in icebreakers. The 2011 expedition from June 23 to July 7 begins in Helsinki, Finland, where guests spend the night in a centrally located hotel. On June 24, they are flown from Helsinki to Murmansk, Russia, the homeport of the Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet to board 50 Years of Victory. The expedition vessel generates 75,000 horsepower enough to crush through packed ice 10 feet thick.
Reaching the North Pole can take between 4 and 8 days, depending on weather and ice conditions. When the top of the world is reached, guests enjoy a champagne toast and a barbecue on the ice. On the southbound journey, shore landings are made in Franz Josef Land. The uninhabited Russian islands are located 10 degrees from the North Pole and are the natural habitat of magnificent polar bears and ungainly walrus.

I have to admit, I'm torn about this question. I absolutely couldn't stand Katy Perry when she first came out. It really bothered me that someone who was a former Christian singer did what I considered "selling out" just to get famous. Her song "I Kissed A Girl" really put her on the map, and I just couldn't understand why people were embracing the song so much. I haven't really been a big fan of hers since then, but am finding some of her songs really good and I have to admit she's a very good singer. Not only that, but the girl is gorgeous, and therefore I will give credit where credit is due, even though I'm still on the fence about her. I'm curious what your thoughts are about her? Here are some gorgeous shots of her and her newest video, which I love...such a great song..."The One That Got Away."

I feel the same about her as you Kori.
I'm just the opposite - I used to like her but now I'm finding I like her less. She's absolutely horrible live and just seems to be trying to hard now in my opinion
I too have mixed feelings on Katy. I love love love her last album (it's a great one to plug in a bop around to) and I think that she is stunningly gorgeous (when she doesn't dye her hair wacky colors). But there's just something about her that doesn't sit quite right.
Chelsea ()
I think she is pretty and some of her songs are catchy, but her music will never be on my ipod. I think shes overrated! Beautiful and a beautiful studio voice, but I don't love her.
i actually love katy perry and all of her songs. great blog. follow?
I like her. I understand what you say about selling out, but she's so extremely talented, and just gorgeous as can be. It's really hard not to like her, and her catchy tunes.
Her songs are always super catchy!! I can't help but like her! :)
I love her. She is stunning and different and just great.
I love her! I've been a fan from the beginning.
I wasn't a fan of hers at first because I couldn't stand her first song. I've loved all of her songs after that one though!
This girl is gorgeous...hands down. Not liking her funky hair phase though but all in all I like her. The singing...she's got a great voice just sometimes uses it not to her advantage...though, I have to say I'm listening to her music ever since it came out...just because it's catchy and I can work out easier. Haha!
i love katy perry. however I think she started her career the way she did in a way to rebel the way she was brought up. but i feel like she has toned down a bit. however i'm not a big fan of "the one that got away"
I’m torn about her too, but I like her less now than I used to. There are so many good songs from her first album and the songs from her second album lack the heart her earlier songs had (besides I Kissed A Girl, of course). She just makes mindless music to sell records now. I think she’s pretty and talented, but her over the top antics drive me crazy. Take a note from Adele’s playbook and focus on the talent, ladies!
I'm so over her! I'm not into any of her songs. She's right up there with Taylor Swift when it comes to annoying the heck outta me! Over them.

Renan Barao punches Scott Jorgensen at UFC 143 on Feb. 4, 2012 in Las Vegas. Image via Esther Lin of MMA Fighting
The fights just keep coming for UFC 148, but this one is a bit odd. Renan Barao has established himself as a top five bantamweight and was considered a candidate to face the winner of the third Dominick Cruz vs. Urijah Faber bout for the UFC bantamweight title. In the meantime though, he's facing an unranked fighter with just one UFC win. Here's the news from UFC.com:.
I guess the story is that they're both on long winning streaks? Okay, sure. Barao (28-1, 1 NC) is coming off an impressive win over Scott Jorgensen at UFC 143 last month, and has won all three of his UFC bouts to date. Hougland (10-4) picked up a decision win over Donny Walker in his only UFC fight to date back at UFC 132 in July.
Honestly, this looks a little bit like a showcase bout for Barao at first glance. No disrespect to Hougland, but Barao facing an unranked fighter at this stage has to be for a reason, right?

Jayne Kamin-Oncea-US PRESSWIRE
Miesha Tate vs. Cat Zingano will take place at The Ultimate Fighter 17 on April 13 and will be the second women's MMA fight in UFC history.
Another fight has been added to the finale of The Ultimate Fighter 17 with Miesha Tate meeting Cat Zingano set to meet in the UFC's second ever women's bout. Earlier today a bout between Gabriel Gonzaga and Travis Browne was also announced for the show.
MMA Fighting with the news:.
The UFC seemed to be hoping that things would work out with Cristiane Santos to set up a superfight between Rousey and Cyborg in the near future, but with Cyborg recently asking for her release and the prospect of the two meeting at 135 pounds unlikely, it would seem near certain that Tate vs. Zingano could determine a title challenger.
Tate lost the Strikeforce title to Rousey in a grudge match with action that matched the pre-fight trash talk. While the brutal armbar result left no real question as to who the better woman was that night, a rematch between the two still might be the biggest potential fight in WMMA.
The undefeated Zingano (7-0) has a fairly impressive resume, with stoppage victories over Takayo Hashi and Carina Damm and has only gone to decision once.

Renewable Energy Bill Passes Japan’s Lower House of Parliament
Japan’s lower house of parliament approved legislation to subsidize electricity from renewable sources as the country reduces its dependence on atomic energy after the Fukushima nuclear crisis.
Passage of the bill, which now goes to the upper house, sets the stage for Prime Minister Naoto Kan to leave office this month and the ruling Democratic Party of Japan to choose his successor. Kan’s popularity has fallen over his handling of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster and he pledged to step down once the Diet approves his legislative agenda.
The legislation requires utilities to buy electricity generated by geothermal, solar and wind sources at above-market rates in order to stimulate investment in renewable energy, which accounts for 9 percent of Japan’s power supply. Solar panel manufacturers like Kyocera Corp. (6971) and geothermal plant developers including Fuji Electric Co. may benefit from the subsidies, known as feed-in tariffs.
Kan last month called for phasing out atomic power after the March earthquake and tsunami caused the worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.

EU Plan for Failed Clearinghouses Shouldn’t Sink Banks, EBA Says
European Union plans for handling failing clearinghouses should be designed in a way that won’t cripple banks, the bloc’s regulators said today.
Some options being weighed by the EU for allocating losses at a crisis-hit clearinghouse “could spread the problems” to healthy financial institutions, according to an opinion published by the European Banking Authority. “In a situation of stress, banks could be seriously hit.”
The European Commission is seeking views until Dec. 28 on measures to take taxpayers off the hook for rescuing institutions such as clearinghouses, central securities depositories and large insurance companies. Steps being considered include forced writedowns of margin that lenders have posted with central clearers.
Clearinghouses such as LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. and Deutsche Boerse AG’s (DB1) Eurex Clearing operate as central counterparties for every buy and sell order executed by their members, who post margin, reducing the threat from a trader’s default.
The EU should also weigh rules for failing hedge funds, the EBA said. The EBA brings together bank regulators in the 27- nation EU to coordinate rulemaking.

I love a party. People, food, drink, celebrations, music, something new to see, old friends to greet, new friends to make -- there’s just nothing better than a party.
Give me a party in May, after months of cold, boring winter and soggy, iffy March and April, and there is just nothing better than a party in May.
Unfortunately, I rarely have time to throw parties. Most of my friends don’t have time to throw them either. Before you feel sorry for my party-less state, let me tell you that every single month -- including soggy April and wonderful May -- Maryville throws a party for me.
So don’t despair that you or I must be in a party-less state. It’s time again for the Maryville Arts Coalition Last Friday Art Walk.
Art Walk happens every month, but there is always something special about the spring and pre-summer months. Folks are in such good moods. Everyone is so happy to be out of the house and walking around in clothes that are faux-fur lined and zipped against the wind. At April’s Art Walk last month, there was just such a feeling of release in the air, such a great feeling of “Man, it’s good to be out again.”
And I only got to three places on the map! There was so much hugging going on, so much catching up with folks I hadn’t seen in a while, plus a Find the Art in Arthritis Scavenger Hunt to promote, that I didn’t get very far down Broadway.
My mission for May is to visit as many of the Art Walk participants as I can squeeze into the 5 to 9 p.m. time frame.
I wonder if we are beginning to take for granted the talent we see every month at the MAC First Friday Art Walk. I’ve been to some of those gallery crawls and walks in nearby cities, and I’m telling you that the variety and the talent level of what these businesses and MAC are bringing in to downtown Maryville is top-notch. I could spend my whole paycheck and greatly expand my cultural knowledge just talking to the artists and soaking in their offerings each month.
May’s Art Walk is certainly no exception. Some of the featured artists are new names to me -- which isn’t hard as I’m not the most cultured person in town. Some, however, I am beginning to recognize from previous Art Walk experiences, and I am excited to see what they are offering this month.
Plus, there are two new businesses on the walk for May, in addition to the exhibits at the Clayton Center for the Arts, which was added a few months ago. Little Nifties, 300 E. Church Ave., is under Dandy Lions, where Lyda Plemons gallery used to be. I’m as anxious to see the store as I am featured artist Linda Sharp’s mixed media gourds.
Morgan Place Spa, 206 High Street, stretches Art Walk almost to Lamar Alexander Parkway and gives another place to stop on the way to-or-from the Clayton Center. Katie Kinney will have an exhibit there that she has titled “Soul Searching.”
Other features this month include Fine Arts Blount ArtSpace Gallery at 106 E. Broadway Ave., hosting Sallie Macy and Olga Radar who will feature an exhibit entitled “A Leg at Every Corner.” On the second floor, Maryville High School student work will be on display. I’ve seen some of the talented work by MHS students, so trust me when I tell you not to skip the second floor. It could be some of your favorite work this month.
In Ta Dye 4 Ink at 113 W. Harper Ave., the sounds of the band Cup O Jazz will entertain folks in the store for Last Friday Art Walk. Ta Dye 4 Ink is adding some variety to Art Walk, so I’m anxious to hear the band.
At The Village Tinker at 417 W. Broadway Ave., which is one of the most eclectic and interesting stores you will find anywhere in East Tennessee, artisan Jean Terry will be featured with her jewelry.
Professional Hair Design, tucked away at 120 E. Broadway Ave., will show silk work by Debbie Harrington. I’m not sure what silk work is, but I’m sure going to find out.
Tomato Head Restaurant at 211 W. Broadway Ave. has a photography exhibit entitled “Discover Life in America.” At Broadway Gallery at Preservation Plaza, oil paintings by Gail Kornoupakis and Norma Riegle will be on display.
Clay sculptor Leanne Moe will feature her work at Studio 212. The business is located at 212 E. Harper Ave.
Boyd Thomas Clothing at 227 W. Broadway Ave., will feature paintings by Tammy Schlosser. Tammy is a member of Fine Arts Blount, and the works of hers I have seen are primarily in oils and have that Old Masters look and feel, so it is sure to be a great exhibit.
The Capitol Theatre promises to keep the party going even after Art Walk officially ends with the Streamliners Big Band sound, so you will have plenty of excuses to make a night of it.
Come on out Friday night. You will see everyone you know and a bunch of folks you need to know. Just strolling around downtown will make you smile and lift your spirits, I promise. As they sang in Camelot -- “It’s May, it’s May, the lusty month of May. The lovely month when everyone goes blissfully astray…”
Last Friday Art Walk is the perfect place to celebrate the last few days of this great month!
Following are photos we took last month as folks enjoy the April Last Friday Art Walk.

I’ve received a few emails this summer regarding my wedding ring photography. So, I thought I would pull a few of my favorite ring shots from recent weddings and talk a little about how I shot them. *Warning* If you aren’t a photographer, you might want to skip to the pictures as “photographer geek talk” is about to ensue.
The lens I use most is a Nikon 60mm Micro/Macro AF lens. This lens allows me to focus down to life size. Life size means that if a ring is 1″ across, then the entire ring will fill the frame of the camera. This lens is big and a lot to lug around, but it’s clarity when focused on something small (like rings) is far superior to a standard lens so it’s worth the weight to carry around a wedding. If you shoot rings, do yourself (and your clients a favor) and get a proper micro/macro lens.
The next most important item is a quality tripod. Most of my macro photography is done on a tripod. You simply can’t handhold and get good results when stopped down to f8-f16 in the dark at 10pm during a wedding reception. And when it comes to tripods, get a good one the first time and you will have it for the rest of your career. I use a Bogen aluminum with a Really Right Stuff, BH-40 and believe this to be one of my very best photography investments.
Next: lighting. I like the Fenix line of pocket flashlights. They are small, easy to carry around and manipulate. The light emitted is easily balanced and the battery life is unexpectedly long.
Finally, your imagination is your only limitation! Rings are brilliant and gorgeous. Contrast is key and focus is not to be missed. Take your time and be very careful not to drop them or to let them roll off the table, between rocks, through cracks, over the cliff – you get the idea!
If you have any further questions about rings and how to photograph them or anything else for that matter, please email me anytime!

Welcome to Bluffscape Amish Tours in beautiful Lanesboro, Minnesota. We are excited that you have found us and hope that you take the time to explore the Southeastern Minnesota culture we have to offer you. Here is our story.
The Beginning
2005, Dave & Joan Ruen began their new business venture in Lanesboro. Joan taught high school business part-time and wanted to start a small business. Dave works full time in agribusiness, but fully supports Joan in the operation.
We both were interested in framing and decided that custom framing and a small art gallery would be a great fit for the Lanesboro community as it is known as one of 100 Best Small Art Towns in America by author John Villani.
Almost a year into the business we decided to add instant digital photo processing as a service to the community. The photo kiosk saved people a trip out of town for quick and easy photo service.
A New Addition
November 4, 2007, we purchased Flaby's Amish Tour business. Gerry had wonderful tours with the Amish, and we thought it would be fun to carry on Flaby's professional Amish tours. Vern, Eric, Rory, and Joan are our excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly hosts that guide the tours. Dave is great with people and looks forward to a few Saturdays for his turn as the tour guide.
After much thought and with mixed emotions, January 31, 2010, we closed the art gallery and gift shop, but continue with the Amish tours. Thank you to our gallery artists and customers, we had fun serving you!
The Ruen Family
David, Joan, Meredith, Kirsten, and the late Andrew Ruen make up the Ruen Family.
David is a native of Lanesboro. He is employed in the agribusiness industry and you may see him guiding a tour occasionally on Saturdays. Dave has lived in various places in the midwest due to his career and is now settled back in his hometown.
Joan was raised in northwestern Minnesota. Joan moved from the flat Red River Valley to the rolling hills of the Bluff Country. She appreciates the beauty of both the open prairies of NW MN and the bluffs of SE MN! Joan enjoys guiding the Amish tours and getting to know the Amish families and the guests on the tour.
Our Reservation Specialists
The friendly staff at Stone Mill Hotel & Suites in the red Feed Mill building in Lanesboro will be taking your reservations for Bluffscape Amish Tours. They are glad to take your reservations and answer questions you may have about our tours.

Plassnik on Iran: "No reason for relief or cries of triumph"
06.12.2007
Foreign Minister at "question hour" in the National Council
Vienna, 6 December 2007 - "It is without any doubt a demanding mission for both domestic and foreign policy, which we have prepared with the corresponding care and precision," said Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik during today's "question hour" in the National Council on Austria’s mission in Chad. "This EU Bridging Mission is designed to help the people in the region, not France," said Plassnik, pointing out to the clear dividing line between France's military presence and the EU mission. "There are no doubts as to the non-partisan and impartial approach of the EU. I did not make myself very popular with our French partners during the negotiations on the mandate. I persistently demanded that there is a clear political framework for the mission. This includes the mission’s strict independence, clear time limits, and close links to the United Nations."
The Minister pointed out to the "multidimensional international presence" in Chad, which was established by UN Security Council resolution 1778 (2007) and consists of the following components: the UN Mission (MINURCAT) aimed at improving the security of the civilian population and guaranteeing international human rights standards, which will train the Chadian police force to protect the refugee camps, and the EU Bridging Operation, which will create a secure environment for the return of the refugees and internally displaced persons and for the implementation of the UN Mission.
"The new EU Reform Treaty will not change our neutrality," reiterated Plassnik, answering repeated questions with regard to the future Treaty of Lisbon. "Even in the future, Austria cannot be forced to participate in an EU military campaign. Both the commitment to a common foreign policy in solidarity within the European Union and neutrality equally form part of our Federal Constitution. And this will not change."
According to Plassnik, the same applies to the area of water supply and water resource management, an issue of great importance to Austria. "Unanimity is still required in this respect. No changes can or will be made here against our will." The Minister also stressed the additional protection provided by the EU Reform Treaty, which clearly states the responsibility of national states for services of general interest, including, for instance, communal water supply.
"I do not want to imagine a European Union without Carinthia, and I cannot imagine Carinthia without the European Union," said Plassnik on a question concerning the signature campaign against the EU Reform Treaty organized by the BZÖ in Carinthia. The Minister reminded that especially Carinthia, according to the words of Provincial Government Member Josef Martinz is a "European champion in collecting EU subsidies" and has received approx. 1.9 billion Euros worth of direct aid from the EU since accession. "Popular support for the signature campaign is not convincing. In any case, I will continue to patiently and persistently inform the people of Carinthia on the EU and the new Reform Treaty. I am convinced that it will be perceived accordingly."
The Minister emphasized the continued international concern over the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. "The latest report by the US Intelligence Services is not a reason for relief or for cries of triumph. It is now important for all sides to pull themselves together to finally establish a climate for negotiations. A parallel moratorium - stop of uranium enrichment and suspension of sanctions - could pave the way for negotiations."
When asked about developments in the Middle East, the Minister pointed out the "energy boost" given to the peace efforts by the Middle East conference in Annapolis: "There is now a chance for concrete progress. A peace roadmap containing all core issues is already on the table. But the political will must ultimately come from this region." There is a risk, however, that extremist forces will attempt to undermine such progress, said Plassnik. Therefore, it is now particularly important to remain engaged and convince public opinion in the region. "I particularly supported this approach in Annapolis. It is also important to involve the women and the youth in the region in this process. We need a broad and sustainable alliance of all moderate forces."
In this context, Plassnik also referred to the follow-up to the Women's Conference on the Middle East that she organized in the spring: "We will organize a media seminar with female journalists from the region in Vienna in late January, we support concrete women’s projects in the Palestinian territories as part of development cooperation, for instance in the area of health, and my Greek colleague Dora Bakoyannis will organize a follow-up conference in the spring of 2008."

Greetings All. I just purchased my first BMW, 1987 325i with a 5 speed. The dealer said its battery was bad and wouldn't hold a charge. Figured it was no big deal, jumped it off and I drove it home (I test drove it a couple of weeks ago). When I got home and put it in the garage where it was dark, I realized that the Instrument Panel, rear marker, and license plate lights were on. Got the wiring diagram, chased it down to the headlight switch, and realized the wiring to it was melted. Mainly the Gray/Red wire. Several others were melted from the 25 pin connector towards the instrument panel, and from the connector towards the firewall. It looks like one of the previous owners botched a splice and the electrical tape came off. Should I try to rewrap all the wires? Can I get a new harness from the connector to the instrument panel? Where's some good places to buy parts? Thanks!

At least I thought I ordered them. Tuns out that the front tire is unavailable nation wide. I called several large distributors. Since I have the Anakee 2 rear coming, would it be advisable to purchase the original Anakee for the front? The Anakee 2 replaced the original Anakee. I think part of the difference is that the 2s wear better.

I read the ON review article talking about the back support belt. I went to their website & there is a new version & for 1/2 price the older version. Anyone have comments on one to the other- or either one? New has improved brace in back.
Also, I'm a 40 waist & sort of fall into two sizes which I would need to resolve .

Solar manufacturers squeezed between rising silicon costs and falling cell prices
Details
The price of solar-grade silicon has jumped to its highest in almost two years, while module prices have declined
London and New York – Makers of solar cells are under severe pressure with the spot price of cells at an all-time low at the same time as prices for solar-grade polysilicon and wafers have been increasing.
The prices charged for solar-grade polysilicon and wafers continued to increase in March 2011. Cuts in subsidy support on 1 January across major European markets, in the form of lower feed-in tariffs for solar electricity, are putting downward pressure on the prices of finished photovoltaic modules. Because of limited supply, the price of silicon is not falling - in fact it is rising.
The latest Bloomberg New Energy Finance Solar Value Chain Index, just published, the average spot price of polysilicon reached $79/kg in March 2011, the highest since May 2009 when the Index began. The price of polysilicon in China is higher than in the rest of the world, due to import restrictions and limited domestic supply.
The price of wafers also increased, with 6" multicrystalline silicon wafer prices reported at $3.62/piece on average in March, up 3% from February. Multi-crystalline silicon cell prices however were on average at $1.25 per Watt in March 2011, down 9.4% from December 2010.
The dollar price of modules (or panels) has dropped by almost 7% since December 2010, despite the strengthening euro, the currency of the world’s largest photovoltaic markets. The March results of the Bloomberg New Energy Finance Module Price Index show an average factory gate price across all markets for immediate delivery of $1.88/W for crystalline silicon modules. Although this is down since December, it is above the market’s previous expectations.
"The global demand for PV modules continues to be very strong, mainly driven by anticipation of further tariff cuts in Italy, Germany, Slovakia and the rest of the European PV markets," says Martin Simonek, analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance. "The first half of 2011 will see relatively small declines in module prices, despite the pressure from developers, because of supply bottlenecks upstream."
The data for Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Solar Value Chain Index and Module Price Index are collected between second and eighth day of each month through a questionnaire sent out to over 120 companies that buy, sell or trade polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules. The monthly results for both surveys are sent to all participating companies on the tenth day of each month. The Solar Value Chain Index started in May 2009 and the Module Price Index was launched in November 2010. Participation is free of charge for manufacturers across the solar value chain, and in case of the Module Price Index also for traders and developers. For further information on the Index, please contact msimonek@bloomberg.net

bnetTV speaks with Jim Manis of the Mobile Giving Foundation at the 2012 MMA Forum held in New York.
The Mobile Giving Foundation (MGF), headquartered in Issaquah, Washington,.
The Mobile Giving Foundation serves as the “glue” between a charitable giving campaign, the wireless industry and the 250 million wireless users in the United States. MGF processes and vets applications from nonprofit organizations wishing to deploy wireless technology in their communication and fundraising activities because we know it is critical to have a trusted third party—in this case, MGF—affirm the quality and integrity of nonprofits using this technology to solicit contributions. Once approved, MGF develops fundraising campaigns in conjunction with established mobile marketing firms and the nonprofit. Our messaging platform is then used by wireless carriers through their short message service (SMS) centers. (SMS is a communications protocol that allows the exchange of brief text messages between mobile telephone devices.) The wireless carriers pass 100% of the charitable funds they collect through to MGF. The MGF also remits 100% of the donation to the recipient nonprofit within 30 days of receiving funds from the wireless carriers. The MGF charges back costs for short-code costs, reporting and messaging charges directly to the nonprofit organizations or their supporting service providers on a post-donation basis.

My dragon sculpture! This isn't clay!
I am actually surprised how well this came out since this isn't even clay. This is what you do. 1- Make a "frame" for the dragon out of wire. 2- Get newpaper and put it on the wire. Tape it so it stays. 3- Get newspaper strips and paper

Topic: Master Replicas - 1,500 Fett blasters
This just in...
The blaster is a limited edition of 1,500. In case you missed the details, see our April 6, 2006 report. Our own Blaster4Hire also started a thread on this earlier, here.
On the MasterReplicas.com site right now, it's reporting this at $45... clearly this is incorrect -- someone call them on it -- as the list price is $579.
If you're considering a purchase -- and I assume most younger collectors will pass -- BFFC is in the Master Replicas affiliate program.

The foundation of The Breath of Life is a simple exercise called twenty connected.
Merge the inhale with the exhale so the breath is connected without any pauses. One inhale connected to one exhale equals one breath. All twenty breaths are connected in this manner so you have one series of twenty connected breaths with no pauses.
Consciously pull the inhale in a relaxed manner and let go completely on the exhale while continuing to keep the inhale and exhale the same length. be at sessions, or take my Breath of Life workshop.

The North Face© Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc©
The Bob Graham Round is one of a number of "qualifying races" for the 2009 UTMB©. The Club has been in contact with the UTMB© organisers and has supplied relevant information about the Round to them. The organisers have supplied the Club with its "Qualifying race Ultra-Trail"© logo and when you click on this it will take you directly to their website at. The BG has been awarded 4 qualifying points.
In the past, potential entrants into the UTMB© have emailed PDF copies of their certificates to the race organisers, who have not accepted the certificate as evidence of BG completion. The Club's own membership list is kept as up to date as is sensibly possible, bearing in mind the timing of attempts and the ratification procedure. It is though possible that someone who completes a successful Round will not be shown as a member on the membership list. The club sends the list of the current and previous years' completions to the organisers at the end of October each year.
In those circumstances, members should contact the Secretary by email (see the Contacts page), who will endeavour to assist further (having liaised with the Membership Secretary) by contacting the UTMB© organisers to confirm that the relevant person has completed the Round. The Secretary has a direct email line to the UTMB© Race Director Michel Pelotti and the organising team.

Has. Unfortunately, there’s one more flaw which ideally should make the creative honchos shun her from promoting their products – and that’s her increased weight. But looks like Ash has done something right (in her career and in her past life) to win the implicit trust of brand-makers. She has not just been amazingly focused, but also made sure she looks great neck up, even though her body has resisted going through the turmoil of heavy duty exercise – but hey, has she lost some weight over the past couple of months, Photoshop notwithstanding?
She seems to enjoy lording it over the established Bollywood ladies. And now, as she is effortlessly putting her stamp on big-fat-money-minting-brands, we wonder how she’s doing it all. One of her strategies is, we think, to choose her brands very carefully. From being Goodwill Ambassador with the United Nations to representing Kalyan Jewellers, Ash is not just making mature decisions, but also opting for products and endorsements that complement her age and her subtle yet classy style.
Now that Ash is playing her cards right with her amazingly deft hands, we are glad the former Miss World has very smartly created a space for herself in the advertisement arena. And since she’s ageing gracefully, we think that’s one more reason for her fans and high-end brands to be even more impressed by the beautiful lady…

JAB TAK HAI JAAN song Challa: Shahrukh Khan meets Katrina Kaif
Watch the melodious new song from Yash Chopra’s new musical are written by Gulzar in Punjabi and will therefore take a while to sink in, but for starters the hook line means ‘What are you searching for, oh bohemian?’. Just as with translations of the poem in the posters, we hope this song will be morphed into Hindi so that everyone can understand it better. Talking about this song Yashji said, “Challa from JTHJ is my fav song & it is the song of the film, it is the soul of the film.”
The video captures the beauty of London. Shahrukh is seen wandering through the streets, strumming his guitar and singing the hummable song with all the body language only he can convey. King Khan does odd jobs – washing cars, busking, hauling crates of fish – like he did in My Name Is Khan when he desperately wanted to make money. We wonder what he is looking for in JTHJ…Does he find it when he sees Katrina Kaif as she drops a coin into his hat? Wonder where the story goes from here…
Challa is sung by Rabbi Shergill and is a breath of fresh air in the usually cliched filmi soundtrack we hear these days. Dear Bollywoodlifer, did you like the song?

Parkway Drive hit the studio and begin new albumon July 11th, 2012
Fresh off the release of their ‘Home Is For The Heartless‘ DVD release last week, Parkway Drive are now knuckling down on their fourth album in a Los Angeles studio with Matt Hyde, whose vast resume includes Slayer, Sum 41, Alkaline Trio, Hatebreed and Children of Bodom. The recording is due to take seven weeks, which is the longest time the band has spent on any album. The yet to be titled album will follow up 2010’s phenomenally successful ‘Deep Blue‘, which debuted #2 on the ARIA Charts and #39 in the US on the Billboard 200, as well as reaching Gold sales and winning the ARIA Award for Best Hard Rock and Metal Album in 2010. Vocalist Winston McCall says new material flowed easily in the wake of ‘Deep Blue‘,.” Stay tuned for title, artwork, tracklisting details in the coming weeks. A little more info can be found [Here].

Food Specials:
If you're craving cold beer, hot crabs smothered in Old Bay seasoning and a wooden mallet (you have had a rough week after all, couldn't hurt to crack a few crabs), head to Bar Pilar. For $60 you get a dinner for two consisting of 10 steamed crabs and two side dishes. I'm a fan of Justin Bittner's potato salad as well as their roasted potatoes with aioli. While it's not included with the crab dinner, definitely get the slow-roasted pork shoulder on toasted, crusty bread. Slow roasted pork. Carmelized outer coating. Need I say more?
While Café Saint-Ex is undergoing a kitchen expansion, you can still head to 14th street for their "pop-up patio picnics" featuring burgers, sausages, classic picnic sides of potato salad and grilled vegetables, as well as "poptails," aka boozy cocktail popsicles. The kitchen's expansion is said to be completed in four weeks.
You're tired of the Georgetown scene in the summertime, clogged with tourists waiting to shove cupcakes they've seen on TV in their faces. Frankly, I don't blame you. But here are two reasons why you should check out G-town this month:
1. "Dog Days of Summer" at Bourbon Steak - Pay homage to some local DC food and order a Red Apron Butchery hot dog and a DC Brau American pale ale for $7. The dogs aren't on the menu, so consider yourself in the know now, you hip city-dweller, you.
2. 1789 Summer Special - One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Think it's just reserved for a special night out or when Obama feels like taking a foreign dignitary out for dinner? Think again. From now until September 15 on Sundays through Thursdays, you can get a three-course dinner for $40. You can request a coupon online or mention the deal to your server.
Food Events:
Pig out literally at Bourbon Steak's second annual pig roast on August 14 from 12-3 PM. Chill on the restaurant's patio while you eat homemade bratwursts, sausages, carnitas and more. The restaurant will have a taco stand and their pastry chef Brenton Balika is carrying the pork theme through dessert with ice creams and pies with "pork-filled garnishes." Tickets are $35 for just food or $50 for food and drinks, and you can order them by calling 202-944-2026. They'll have you wee-ing and wah-ing all the way home.
Oyamel is hosting its 4th annual squash blossom festival until August 14. Don't miss their light summer squash soup with corn, tomatoes, squash blossoms and mexican cream, as well as their squash blossoms stuffed with goat cheese. And if you're looking for an unusual cocktail, try their "Maria Bruja" which is a blend of zucchini, avocado juice, milagro blanco and mezcal served with a squash blossom chip in a salt-rimmed glass.
Take a bite:.
I am such a food buff so I'll definitely try all those food events that you suggested. I also would be trying cooking vacations soon so that I'll learn how to cook as well.

Hand: A player’s hand is the combination of cards he holds. Play: A single game, from one shuffle to the next is called a play. Pot: The pot is the accumulated pool of money bet by players over the course of a game. A round of poker is a battle for the pot, and the winner of any round wins it as a prize.

Hand Tie or Split Pot: If two players have the same hand then they divide the pot equally between them. When the pool is not exactly divisible then the left over amount goes to the player who called the highest bet. Ante: An enforced bet that must be made by all players before any cards are dealt. An ante encourages action in a game. Rake: A commission charged by a poker room for every hand played. The rake is usually taken as a percentage of the pot in a given hand. For example, if the rake is 10%, and a pot reaches a final of $10, the rake will be $1. Poker rooms generally use rake as their sole source of revenue. Showdown: After the last round of betting in a round of poker, a showdown occurs- players must turn over their cards, and compare their five-card poker hands.
Call: A player may call a bet by putting an amount of money exactly equal to the bet into the pot. For example, if Jim bets $2, and Brian wants to call Jim’s bet, Brian must put $2 into the pot. Fold: A player may fold his hand by laying down his cards, and forfeiting further play in a round of poker. For example, if Jim bets $2 and Brian wishes to fold, Brian must surrender his cards to the dealer, and will remain inactive for the rest of the round. Raise: A may raise a previous bet by putting an amount greater than the bet into the pot. A raise must be at least double the size of the previous bet. For example, if Jim bets $2, and Brian wants to raise Jim’s bet, Brian may put $4 or more into the pot. Check: A player may pass his turn in a round of poker without taking any betting action, only if there are no previous bets in the round. This is known as a check. For instance, if Brian is first to act on the flop in a hand, he has the option of checking his hand, which will put the action on the next player. Also pay attention to the difference in betting structures in limit, no limit and pot limit forms of poker.
Know the order of cards, from low to high- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K) and Ace (A). The ace (A) can usually double as the lowest ranked card as well as the highest. Card suits do not affect ranking- for example, the king of hearts and the king of spades are equal. Final hands in poker are always based on the total rank of five cards.
Familiarize yourself with the definitions of different hands, and with the value of each type. The different categories of five-card poker hands are as follows, from weakest to highest: One Pair, Two pair, Three of a kind, Straight, Flush, Full house, Four of a kind, Straight flush and Royal flush. A given hand beats all hands listed before it.
One pair consists of two cards out of a five-card hand with the same numerical rank. For example: A-A-K-7-6 (a pair of aces), or J-J-8-5-3 (a pair of jacks). If two players show down one pair hands of the same rank, they must compare their next highest card (the kicker) to determine the winner. If the two hands have equal kickers, then the next highest card must be compared- and so on. For example, A-A-7-6-5 (a pair of aces, 6 kicker) beats A-A-7-3-2 (a pair of aces, 3 kicker), since the 6 is a higher ranked card than the 3.
Two pair consists of two different pairs of cards and one other card in a five-card hand. Examples of two pair hands are A-A-K-K-5 (two pair, aces and kings, 5 kicker), and J-J-10-10-7 (jacks and tens, 7 kicker). If two players both show down two pair hands with equal top pairs, the lower pairs are compared, and the highest wins. For example A-A-K-K-5 (aces and kings) beats A-A-J-J-3 (aces and jacks). If both pairs are the same, the kickers are compared. For example, A-A-10-10-5 (aces and tens, 5 kicker) beats A-A-10-10-4 (aces and tens, 4 kicker).
Three of a kind consists of three cards of the same numerical rank in a five-card poker hand. Examples of three of a kind would be A-A-A-3-2 (three of a kind aces), and 5-5-5-K-J (three of a kind fives). If two or more players show down three of a kind hands of equal rank, then the players must compare their kickers. As with pair hands, the hand with the highest kicker wins. For example, K-K-K-A-10 (three of a kind kings, ace and 10 kicker) beats K-K-K-A-9 (three of a kind kings, ace and 9 kicker), since 10 is higher in rank than 9.
Flush consists of five cards in non-sequential order, all of the same suit. For example, A-9-7-5-2 of hearts is an ace high heart flush. K-J-8-6-3 all of spades is a king high spade flush. If two players both show down flushes, then they must compare their top cards to determine a winner. The highest ranked card wins. If these are equal, then they must compare their second highest cards, and the highest wins. If those are equal, then the third highest cards must be compared- and so on. For example, J-9-7-5-2 of hearts beats J-9-7-4-3 of hearts, since the 5 is of higher rank than the 4.
Full House consists of three cards of the same numerical value, as well as a pair. It is useful to think of a full house as containing both three of a kind and a pair. For example, A-A-A-5-5 is a full house, aces full of 5’s. 6-6-6-2-2 is a full house, sixes full of 2’s. If two players show down full houses with three of a kinds of equal rank, the hand with the highest ranked pair would win the pot. For example, K-K-K-8-8 would beat K-K-K-2-2.
Four of a kind consists of four cards of the same numerical rank, and any other card. An example of four of a kind would be, A-A-A-A-3 (four of a kind, aces).
Straight Flush consists of five cards in sequential order, all of the same suit. For example, 7-6-5-4-3 of hearts is a 7-high straight flush.
Royal Flush consists of A-K-Q-J-10, all of the same suit. A royal flush is simply the highest possible straight flush- however because of its very high value, it is given a separate name. The suit of the royal flush does not matter- all of them are equal.
Any five-card poker hand that does not fit into one of the above categories is simply known as a high-card hand. When comparing two such hands, the one with the better highest card wins. If the highest cards are equal the second highest cards are compared. If those are equal, the third highest cards are compared, and so on. For example, A-J-9-5-3 (ace high, jack kicker) beats A-10-9-6-4 (ace high, 10 kicker), since the J is higher ranked than the 10.

The first Sin City volume of the Frank Miller library is an exceedingly handsome compilation of the first four books in Miller's gritty pulp-comic series: The Hard Goodbye, A Dame to Kill For, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard. These four stories--Marv's attempt to track down the killer of a perfect woman, Dwight's encounter with his ex-lover, Dwight's ill-fated attempt to teach a lesson to a brutal thug, and Hartigan's attempt to protect a young girl years after he saved her the first time--have the hallmarks that convinced Robert Rodriguez to turn three of them into the Sin City feature film: brutal violence, dangerous femmes fatale, mob leaders and dirty cops, and stark black-and-white art punctuated by the occasional splash of color. They all look great in these four oversized and heavyweight volumes of glossy paper. Also included are many of the color covers from the original Dark Horse comic books, though there's no supplemental art or creator commentary. Regardless, the presentation alone makes this a collection to savor. --David Horiuchi [via]

Right gallantly and well he fought
Hand to hand with as brave a foe,
Their faces hid by the nodding plumes,
And the dense clouds hanging low.
Did they think, these hot-blooded captains,
That Death was so close by their side,
When Howard has fallen, the bravest—
Rung out on the air far and wide.
“Howard?” His foeman kneels by his side,
And raises his head to his knee—
Oh, God! that brothers should part in youth,
And thus should their meeting be.
Unheard is the deafening battle roar,
Unseen is that dying look;
He hears but the sound of a childish laugh,
And the song of a Northern brook.
He sees two white forms kneeling
In the twilight sweet and dim,
One low couch angel-guarded,
By a mother’s evening hymn.
The Angel of Death came down with the night,
Came down with the gathering gloom;
God pity the little dark-eyed girl,
Alone in the lonely room.
But still by his side his brother kneels,
Chill horror has frozen his veins;
He heeds not the glancing shower of shells,
That with red fire glitters and rains.
And he heeds not the fiery cavalry charge,
That sweeps like a billow on
To death, oh, the bravest and saddest sight,
That man ever gazed upon!
The last shot! What is one life
To the battle’s gory gain?
But, alas, for the little blue-eyed maid
Away on the hills of Maine!.
“My house is thatched with violet leaves
And paved with daisies fine,
Scarlet berries droop over its eaves,
Tall grasses round it shine;
With softest down I have lined my nest,
Securely now will I sit and rest.
“When their wings break from their silvery shell,
Touched by my tender care,
Here shall my little ones safely dwell,
Little ones soft and fair;
Some summer morn they shall try their wings
While their father sits by my side and sings.”
Hard by, just over the streamlet’s edge
A great rock towered in might,
High up, half hidden in moss and sedge,
Were safe little nooks and bright;
Ah well for the bird with her tender breast,
Had she flown to the rock to build her nest!
Poor bird, she built her nest too low;
Alas! for the bird, alas!
That she chose that spot to her woe
In the low dewy grass;
For the reaper came with his gleaming blade.
Alas for love in the violet shade!

He had begun little by little to pick up the course of his life once more, and on a certain Wednesday morning was looking listlessly through the morning paper as he sat in his window-seat. The room was delightful, flooded with the morning sun, the Assyrian bas-reliefs just touched with a ruddy light, the Renaissance portraits looking down at him through a fine golden haze; a little fire, just enough to blunt the keenness of the early morning air, snapping in the famous tiled and flamboyant stove. All about the room was a pleasant fragrance of coffee and good tobacco.
Vandover caught sight of the announcement of the suit with a sudden sharp intake of breath that was half gasp, half cry, starting up from the window-seat, reading it over again and again with staring eyes.
It was a very short paragraph, not more than a dozen lines, lost at the bottom of a column, among the cheap advertisements. It made no allusion to any former stage of the affair; from its tone Ida might have killed herself only the day before. It seemed hardly more than a notice that some enterprising reporter, burrowing in the records at the City Hall, had unearthed and brought to light with the idea that it might be of possible interest to a few readers of the paper. But there was his name staring back at him from out the gray blur of the type, like some reflection of himself seen in a mirror. Insignificant as the paragraph was, it seemed to Vandover as though it was the only item in the whole paper. One might as well have trumpeted his crime through the streets.
“But twenty-five thousand dollars!” exclaimed Vandover, terrified. “Where will I find twenty-five thousand dollars?” And at once he fell to wondering as to whether or no in default of payment he could be sent to the penitentiary. The idea of winning the suit did not enter his mind an instant; he did not even dream of fighting it.
For the moment it was like fire driving out fire. He forgot the loss of his art, his mind filled only with the sense of the last disaster. What could he do? Twenty-five thousand dollars! It would ruin him. A cry of exasperation, of rage at his own folly, escaped him. “Ah, what a fool I’ve been!”
For an hour he raged to and fro in the delightful sunlit room, pacing back and forth in its longest dimension between the bamboo tea-table and the low bookcase, a thousand different plans and projects coming and going in his head. As his wits steadied themselves he began to see that he must consult at once with some lawyer—Field, of course—perhaps something could be done; a clever lawyer might make out a case for him after all. But all at once he became convinced that Field would not undertake his defence; he knew he had no case; so what could Field do for him? He would have to tell him the truth, and he saw with absolute clearness that the lawyer would refuse to try to defend him. The thing could not honourably be done. But, then, what should he do?

The Universe Against Her Related Titles
With the success of the first Telzey Amberdon stories, Schmitz wrote more novelettes, first published in Analog magazine, then gathered into novel form under the title The Telzey Toy (1973). This book draws Telzey deeper into investigative and intelligence work. The Telzey Toy is an android made in physical and mental imitation of Telzey as a part of an egotistical inventor's plan to perfect his product line of androids, with her unwilling cooperation. The Telzey Toy plays with the question of what constitutes a human identity; whether it consists of a body, a set of memories, or a unique location in physical space.
The Lion Game (1973), a sequel to The Telzey Toy, which was first published in serial form, again in Analog, is a densely-plotted novel about a mysterious race of telepathic giants pursuing a ruthless game of power politics and assassination within the Federation of the...

The Firm Key Questions
While an obvious context for discussing the novel is fiction about the law, a less obvious but equally interesting context is the treatment of success in American literature. In his life through law school, Mitch could be a classic example of the Protestant ethic.
How does the American Dream relate to the trait of acquisitiveness, and how does this character with a Ben Franklin-style work ethic become seduced by the firm, are questions that can open up discussion of The Firm into a debate on what Americans consider to be personal success. Readers could consider whether the initial tempting offerings of the firm seem worth the price of long hours and reduced private life (aside from the firm's illegal purpose).
1. How do you like Mitch? How would you define his personality? As he decides how to resolve his conflict, what matters the most to him?...

The Hope Vendetta
Review
The Hope Vendetta
He turned from the window and walked across to the low table. He put down his empty glass and reached out for the pistol. He picked it up and weighed the heavy steel in his hand. He stared at the weapon a long moment as the moonlight glimmered down its length. He clicked off the safety. The desolation that Benedict Hope felt at that moment was complete and all encompassing. He had lost his will to live, and nothing seemed to be able to pull him out of the morass that engulfed him. Yet, somewhere in the depths of his being, strengthened by his years of experience as a Secret Agent and buoyed by his faith, he decided to meet the challenges that faced him. He would leave the SAS and return to Oxford to complete his theological studies. Somehow, he would learn to live without his beloved wife.
"If you love a good adventure mystery with a bit of Biblical history thrown in, THE HOPE VENDETTA will not disappoint."
Vowing to get some peace and tranquility in his life, Ben is not eager to assist Professor Bradbury when he asks for help to find his missing daughter. Zoe Bradbury is not a child but a grown woman and professional archaeologist, despite the fact that she has an overactive libido and an addiction to the wild side of life. Nevertheless, her parents are worried about her and turn to Ben for help. Ben engages his former colleague, Charlie Palmer, to take on the task, but Charlie soon runs into a snag and insists that Ben join in to lend a hand. There on the Greek Island of Corfu, the simple missing person case turns into a heart-stopping case of Biblical proportions.
As Ben begins to investigate the people and places involved in Zoe's life prior to her disappearance, he finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy that will risk the lives of millions of people if it is not uncovered and exposed. This is not an easy task when the conspirators are part of the power structure and famous for their ability to hide in plain sight. What becomes apparent is that Zoe has discovered an important artifact during her last expedition that promises to throw the Christian community into spiritual chaos and the Middle East into flames.
While Ben is an extremely capable investigator, his findings can sometimes lead him to false conclusions, as in the case of televangelist Clayton Cleaver. Certain that he is behind Zoe's disappearance, Ben goes to Savannah, Georgia to confront the man. Cleaver's claim to fame was writing a book that revealed how John the Revelator had appeared to him and verified all the information that is contained in the book of Revelation. He admitted to Ben, under some duress, that this was not true, but he could not afford to have evidence come forth that would prove anything new about the book of Revelation or it would blow his gig.
Upon further investigation, Ben uncovers a plot much more sinister than a greedy televangelist's schemes. While it does not seem possible that people would go to such extremes to secure their evil goals, we need only look at the headlines for proof that they do. In this case, they are willing to start a war between Iran and Israel to prove that the prophecies in Revelation are correct. Of course, they fail to realize that those outcomes are not meant to be in the hands of man but in the hands of God.
If you love a good adventure mystery with a bit of Biblical history thrown in, THE HOPE VENDETTA will not disappoint.

Book Synopsis:.
Author Interview:
Describe your book in five words or less.
Unique plot, never before published
How did the ideas for your books come to you?
When doing yard work, I have lots of time to think about many things. Sometimes, a creative idea comes to mind and I am able to develop it into a story.
What is the hardest part of writing for you? What's the easiest?
The hardest part is making sure that the dialog is natural sounding. Sometimes, it is difficult for the characters to have a detailed conversation without sounding artificial. The easiest part is beginning a new chapter because at this time, I usually have a very clear idea as to where I want to go with the story. It’s then a matter of taking it there.
What's next for you? Are you currently working on or have plans for future projects?
I have completed a second novel titled, Dead in the Water. I am working on the rough draft of a third novel, still untitled, that is probably about 50% completed.
Why did you choose to write for specific genre?
I have a very conservative personality. When I write a suspense thriller, I am able to use my imagination and reach far beyond myself to write about situations that I will never experience in my own personal life.
What's it like hearing that readers are eagerly awaiting your book's release date?
It’s unbelievably flattering. It makes me want to write the best story possible so as not to disappoint whomever might eventually be reading it.
What is one question that you've always wanted to be asked in an interview? How would you answer that question?
Why did I wait so long to begin writing? My answer is that I really don’t know and I now regret that I did. So much time was wasted. I try to accept the old adage that it’s better late than never.
What was your road to publications like?
It had its share of disappointments. I sent out a number of queries that included a short letter and the first 30 pages of the book. Most publishers never responded but a couple requested that I send them the remainder of the book. This indicated to me that my story was generating some interest and this gave me the encouragement that I needed.

Hearts beating as one hot breathe on the back of my neck. Her lips touching my skin heating it up with jus a simple touch. Her eyes blazing with desire for me, making my body ache for her even more so than before. The kisses exchanged making me dizzy with passion, griping her sides trying to keep her as close to me as possible. My teeth just lightly grazing the soft skin of her neck, just enough to send her into a fit of pleasure. Kissing the small mark left behind from my teeth with more force than the bite, thrusting her into me, driven crazy by her gasps of pleasure. My eyes changing the shade of green that could only mean pure want, and need for her touch. Rubbing her back ever so gently hoping to cause her to arch into me. Slowly running my fingers across her exposed thighs, moving my mouth to her chest, nibbling and licking her sweet nipple marking her as my own. Sliding my fingers into her wetness, clutching her harder when the moan escaped her. Slowly rubbing her using the same two fingers to thrust into her, kissing her hard when her body responded to mine.it was another step in getting closer to her, when I let her see me completely vulnerable. Exposing myself to her, I watched her every move, almost jumpingwith excitement as she took me in with her eyes. No longer able to contain myself I sank my tongue into her, letting her experience what I knew she had not. As I sit here now I think about all the ways I could make it more pleasurable for her. I think about how grand I feel when I touch her, the intense explosionsof desire she sends through me when she touches me in anyway. I think about the dizzying effect she has on me when just glancing. The night we spent together was magical, any time we are near each other; Merlin couldn’t even make enough power come out of his wandto make half of the pure raw power that radiates between us. Her fingers playing with my hair, tracing my neck and spine making me scream for her touch. My breath catches as she kisses me smiling every time our lips break.

As stock markets plunged on Tuesday, some online brokerage companies couldn't keep up with their customers' clicks.
Companies including Vanguard Group Inc. in Pennsylvania, Boston's Fidelity Investments, and Bank of America Corp.'s brokerage unit experienced significant increases in the time it took their computer networks to serve up Web pages for customers to log in and arrange stock trades, according to a survey by Gomez Inc., a Lexington consulting company.
Theoretically the time lags could cost millions of dollars for shareholders trying to rapidly liquidate stocks as they fell -- or, conversely benefit them if they were trying to buy as the price was falling. For Vanguard, the worst performer, response time to provide a series of six Web pages for do-it-yourself stock traders fell from 11.5 seconds on Monday afternoon from 3 to 4 p.m., a typical period, to almost 3 1/2 minutes during the same hour on Tuesday, Gomez said.
Fidelity's response time fell from 19.4 seconds to a minute and 36 seconds during the same periods, Gomez said.
"When we see a site that doesn't perform well, either they haven't taken the time to study their customers or made the investments" in equipment, said Gomez vice president Matt Poepsel.
Vanguard blamed ill-timed system maintenance for Tuesday's performance but said all customer transactions on Tuesday went through.
A Fidelity spokeswoman, Anne Crowley, noted stock exchanges also reported slow transactions on Tuesday and said the company is still studying yesterday's transactions, when it had twice as much retail trading as usual. Customers could also access its phone system and branch network, she said. "There was an extraordinary volume yesterday and all firms were dealing with it," she said.
Reaction by Banc of America Investment Services grew from about 16 seconds to about 81 seconds. A Bank of America spokesman, Jon Goldstein, said it is "assessing the situation and ensuring our customers' needs are met."
Online brokerage houses were just one piece of the world's computerized financial system that was stressed on Tuesday, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell about 200 points around 3 p.m. as investors reacted to worries about Chinese stocks and the US economic outlook.
Another problem was a computer glitch at Dow Jones & Co. that prevented it from updating the index in real time , making the 200-point drop appear to happen in minutes rather than over a longer period.
Giving consumers real-time access to market systems has been a central promise of the online brokerage industry, which had 11.4 million visitors -- mostly users -- in January, according to comScore Networks Inc. in Chicago.
A competing company that also studies online brokers , Keynote Systems Inc. in San Mateo, Calif., said it measured similar lag times on Tuesday. It said that slow responses could drive away customers.
"This cost the brokerage traders a lot in brand equity," said Abelardo Gonzalez, Keynote web performance manager. "These are the days that count. A business is judged by how it performs on the critical days, not on a day-to-day basis," he said.
Gomez found younger companies like ETrade Financial Corp. in New York and TD AmeriTrade Inc. performed fastest Tuesday. ETrade, for instance, had a response time of 4.9 seconds during Tuesday's toughest hour, Gomez reported, just off its time on Monday of 4.6 seconds.
To test the brokerages, Gomez and Keynote have set up networks of their own computers that automatically log into brokerage accounts throughout the trading day. For Gomez's test, Poepsel said it uses computers in 10 cities that contact the brokerages over commercial Internet connections that yield speeds much higher than the typical consumer would experience.
These computers then perform a series of six tasks automatically, including calling up the brokerages' home page, logging into an account, checking a portfolio, ordering, and then confirming a trade. The computers do not execute the trade, but that's less important than getting to that final step, Poepsel said.
"If you have a problem, there won't be an execution," he said.

Meehan emerged from an initial field of nearly 80 candidates, dominated by out-of-state academics, by promising university leaders that he would devote much of his time to raising money, particularly to fund teaching and scholarship on nanotechnology, biomanufacturing, and several other new sciences that are the focus of UMass-Lowell's development plans, according to university and local officials.
"Obviously, over a period of time, I've become one of the more prolific fund-raisers in Congress," said Meehan, whose campaign chest is one of the richest in Congress. "The ability to meet with people, to get them enthusiastic, the ability to identify people who would be willing to contribute -- these are all things I bring."
Officials in the Merrimack Valley, which has struggled with a steady loss of manufacturing jobs, said they hoped a galvanized UMass-Lowell would translate into economic benefits for the region by attracting high-tech businesses.
"The fact that he sees the university's role as, certainly, educating students, but also as developing programs that are going to put the university -- and by default the entire region -- at the forefront of this technology, is promising," said Lowell's mayor, William F. Martin Jr., who was on the 21-member search committee that selected Meehan as one of three finalists last month.
Jack M. Wilson, UMass president, called Meehan yesterday morning to inform him that he had been selected for the post. The university's board of trustees is expected to ratify Wilson's choice at a meeting scheduled for today. Meehan, born and raised in Lowell, plans to leave his position on Capitol Hill in July, ending a career that spawned historic legislation on campaign finance reform and tobacco control.
"The decision to leave the House has been the most difficult professional decision of my life," the seven-term congressman said. "But I believe ultimately that education and a technology-driven, highly literate workforce will determine the fate of my region, the region where I grew up."
Wilson said that throughout the selection process, he repeatedly asked Meehan whether he was sure he wanted to give up his political career for the chancellorship.
"He has never been more passionate about the university than now," Wilson said. "We are very fortunate to have someone with Marty Meehan's talents and expertise and that he is an alum."
Meehan will leave behind a new Democratic majority in Congress, where he recently took over as leader of a key House Armed Services subcommittee.
Before heading to Washington, Meehan, 50, served in the Middlesex district attorney's office and as a deputy secretary of state. He and his wife, Ellen T. Murphy, have two sons.
Salary and benefits still have to be negotiated, but Wilson said Meehan would probably earn slightly more than the previous chancellor, William T. Hogan. Hogan's salary was $235,800, and he also received a $28,000 housing allowance. As a representative, Meehan earns $165,200 a year.
Meehan's interest in the job initially drew skepticism from some professors and members of the search committee, who were concerned that a politician might not have the necessary skills to lead the 11,000-student university. Meehan graduated from UMass-Lowell in 1978; he also has a master's degree in public policy and a law degree from Suffolk University,
"Like most academics, one is always worried that someone coming from a political background will not understand the academic needs of a university," said Julie Chen, a professor of mechanical engineering and a member of the search committee. "But I think he can turn this into a top-tier education and research institution."
The two other finalists for the position were David C. Chang, chancellor of Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, and Nabil A. Ibrahim, vice chancellor of academic affairs at Purdue University's campus in Calumet, Ind.
According to search committee members, Meehan converted skeptics during interviews and in a meeting with faculty, staff, and students on campus last week, when he shared his personal story as a son of working-class parents who earned a degree at Lowell and later secured millions of dollars in federal grants for his alma mater.
"He has been a real champion for this campus in Washington, and losing him there will be one downside," said Stephen McCarthy, director of the university's Biodegradable Polymer Research Center, " but I think he will be able to do more on campus."
During his campus visit last week, Meehan said he intends to spend half his time fund raising. In the past four years, budget cuts have shrunk the university's fund-raising operation from 22 full-time employees to 15. Despite the cuts, the university has met or slightly exceeded its goals for the three previous years and has raised $5.4 million, or 60 percent of its target goal, this fiscal year.
"We've been doing pretty good, fund-raising-wise," said John Davis, vice chancellor for university advancement, "but what we really need is a chancellor who will push us over the finish line."
The university has set an ambitious goal of doubling its endowment to $40 million by 2009; with Meehan's fund-raising prowess, Davis said he believes the goal can be raised even higher.
Meehan was well known on Capitol Hill for his tenacious fund-raising. As of Dec. 31, Meehan had $5.1 million left in his political coffers. Federal laws require him to spend the money on his political operation or give it to political parties or charities.
Since Meehan won office in 1993, UMass-Lowell has received more than $200 million in federal funds, much of it for scientific programs championed by the congressman.
Meehan will arrive just as the fruits of his legislative efforts are becoming apparent on campus. The university is planning the construction of an $80 million bio- and nanotechnology research center, part of a broader $266 million initiative to renovate dozens of buildings, classrooms, and laboratories.
Education specialists said the timing is optimal for UMass-Lowell to sharpen its focus on engineering and technology, given the demand for well-trained workers in those fields.
"We haven't done a good job preparing our students for those fields, and other countries have," said Paul Lingenfelter, president of State Higher Education Executive Officers, an association based in Colorado that represents public higher education systems. "We can't rely on foreign engineering talent."
Chris Anderson, president of the Massachusetts High Technology Council, said it would be smart for UMass-Lowell to expand its role in the region's technology sector. He said he believes the university should produce more engineers and more research that leads to local start-up firms. The university has a business incubator program that has produced a few strong companies in the region, but local officials said they hoped its booster effect would be far greater under Meehan.
"Marty's awareness of the strategies to foster university-based research and emerging technologies will position UMass-Lowell to be a leader" in the state's economic fortunes, said Anderson, who is also chairman of the state Board of Education.
The Merrimack Valley's textile-manufacturing base all but disappeared in the latter half of the 20th century. Major employers like Wang and Digital either left the area or went under in the 1990s, leaving parts of the region with high unemployment and declining incomes. Lowell has begun reinventing itself as a low-cost housing alternative for Boston-area workers, and technology start-ups have begun locating in the region; however, local officials say the economy is far from robust.
Martin, the mayor of Lowell, said a Meehan-led renaissance at UMass-Lowell could be the catalyst that the Merrimack Valley has needed: "This could replace the manufacturing jobs we've lost."
A small sample of students and faculty interviewed yesterday had few reservations about having a political figure run the university.
"If he can increase the value of a UMass-Lowell degree, that's what matters to me," said Alos Diallo, 25, a senior biology and philosophy major. "Do we need a PhD to run the university? Probably not."
Charles Thompson, a professor of electrical engineering for the past 20 years, said he was not concerned that Meehan has spent most of his professional life in the rough and tumble political world of Washington, D.C.
"Maybe that makes him more qualified," Thompson said with a chuckle.
Globe correspondent Charles Russo contributed to this report.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Senator John F. Kerry asked Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday to address the Democratic National Convention on its opening night and introduce her husband, former President Clinton, ending an intense lobbying campaign by the New York senator's backers angered by her non-speaking role.
The Kerry campaign unveiled its first set of speakers for the convention early this week, including former Presidents Clinton and Carter, as well as former Vice President Al Gore, but the absence of Senator Clinton from the speaker list drew criticism from Democrats, particularly women.
Clinton said she was not disappointed, but a lobbying effort quickly got underway on her behalf.
Kerry, who campaigned in Pennsylvania and West Virginia yesterday, called Clinton and asked her to introduce her husband in a speech before the convention. A representative from Clinton's office said the senator was "honored and delighted" to get the opportunity to address the convention.

Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon—America's Lothario and America's Sweetheart—are an oddly apt pairing in Seth Gordon's middleweight comedy about a supposedly rock-solid couple undermined by a day with their families. As the biggest romantic comedy debut in months, Four Christmases is poised to rake in the lets-take-grandma-to-the-movies holiday cash, and its appealing trailer has guys secretly hoping their women will drag them along.
Witherspoon stands 5'2"; she barely reaches Vaughn's elbow. But in their first scene she sets her Tracy Flick jaw and tears a too-hesitant Vaughn into bite-sized pieces. It's a seduction game, but the intent is to prove the giant and the pixie are equally matched. Which is ideal in the first act when they're charging through life together like two headstrong bulls. Vaughn and Witherspoon are that smug city couple who knows everyone else is doing it wrong. An engaged couple in their ballroom dance class find themselves on the receiving end of their chirpy argument against the responsible breeder route of marriage and babies. That couple must hate them—we would, a little—if it weren’t for the way Vaughn lovingly, unknowingly plays with Witherspoon's ponytail. (Even worse for everyone else's romantic self-esteem, they're taking the class simply because they love doing everything together.)
Flying to Fiji for Christmas instead of clocking time with their four sets of estranged parents (instead of volunteering in Burma, their given excuse), the couple is ratted out by network TV when all flights are canceled. We've enjoyed their cocky selfishness; just as much, we bask in schadenfreude when they get guilted into making the familial trail of tears. But too soon, Matt Allen, Caleb Wilson, Jon Lucas and Matt Moore's script pressures us to be with them, not against them. Sympathy sucks the poisonous fun from the comedy's redemptive last stretch. The early visits have a wicked glimmer—their first visit with Vaughn's dad (Robert Duvall) is a riot. Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw play Vaughn's short, powerhouse brothers Denver and Dallas—bottom tier UFC fighters—and without question the best gag in the flick is when Favreau pins Vaughn, dry humps his armpit, then derisively throws him a crumpled dollar bill.
Reese Witherspoon, like most females in comedy, falls victim to more jokes than she gets to crack. Kristen Chenowith has a little more fun playing her fertile, femme fatale sister—a stroke of perfect casting as her sister as she's the only actress shorter, blonder, and squeakier than her co-star. But Witherspoon is allowed a nasty, gleeful smirk when she accidentally knocks a baby's head into a door. The screenwriters have tied her characters arc to a station wagon's-worth of infants. Having revealed her ignorance of all things Pampers, Witherspoon is then prodded to undergo a maternal awakening so that she'll pivot and run contrary to Vince's responsibility-phobic eternal youth, and these two stubborn beasts will draw and quarter their relationship. That they Frankenstein-stitch back together their monster perfection is never in doubt, and to the film's credit, the rift is mended with moderate realism. Such truthiness, however, belongs in a kinder, gentler movie instead of a fanged comedy that voluntarily sacrifices its bite.

$13.5 Million Start for 'Star Trek Into Darkness'May 17, 2013 11:51 AM
Paramount's Star Trek Into Darkness started out its domestic run with an opening day take of $13.54 million on Thursday (an estimated $2.0 million from Wednesday night IMAX showings are included within the reported figure). While Star Trek Into Darkness led the daily box office comfortably on Thursday, the film's opening day performance left a lot to be desired for a highly anticipated sequel of its size. With that said, it is extremely likely that the last minute release date change to Thursday took a toll on the film's box office potential yesterday, though to exactly what degree remains to be seen until Friday's performance plays out. In comparison, Thursday's performance for Star Trek Into Darkness was 46 percent softer than the $25.04 million opening Thursday take of 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and 1 percent stronger than the $13.37 million opening Thursday gross of 2009's Terminator Salvation.
Check back throughout the weekend for further updates on the box office progress of Star Trek Into Darkness.
In other box office news, Warner's The Great Gatsby continued its stronger than expected box office run on Thursday with a second place take of $3.43 million. The Baz Luhrmann directed film starring Leonardo DiCaprio was down 12 percent from Wednesday, which represented one of Thursday's stronger daily holds among wide releases. A bit surprisingly, The Great Gatsby has now topped Iron Man 3 at the daily box office for two consecutive days. However, Iron Man 3 should move back ahead in the rankings over the weekend due to the greater appeal of Iron Man 3 with family audiences. The Great Gatsby placed in second for the week with a seven-day start of $66.74 million. That places the film 75 percent ahead of the $38.14 million one-week start of last year's Dark Shadows.
Disney's Iron Man 3 placed in third with $3.297 million. In the process, Marvel's blockbuster superhero sequel surpassed the $300 million mark yesterday. Iron Man 3 reached the milestone on its fourteenth day of release (which ties it with 2009's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen as the fourth fastest film ever to reach the $300 million mark). In addition, Iron Man 3 has now surpassed the $1 billion mark at the global box office with a current global haul of $1.0008 billion (current domestic and overseas totals stand at $301.89 million and $698.9 million respectively). Iron Man 3 was the week's top film with $89.47 million for the frame. That represented a 58 percent decline from the film's opening week performance.

Stories is such a great chapter in Mitten Strings for God - so much imagination and insight. Stories are a HUGE part of our family thanks to Will... but I'll fill you in on that in a later post! Here's a few excerpts from the author, Katrina Kenison, for us to think about for this week's Simple and Slow Friday.
...I didn't have the nerve to tell stories to my children. I felt I lacked the spontaneity, imagination, and wisdom necessary to make up stores off the cuff, and I was sure I didn't have the time to sit down and work out a full-blown narrative in advance...
Several months later, I joined a storytelling class taught by a therapist and former Waldorf teacher named Nancy Mellon. Each of us, it turned out, was there for the same reason - we yearned to cast magic spells, to spin tales of wonder, to enchant our children with stories - and yet none of us felt quite up to the challenge. (p. 70)
According to Nancy, our first task as storytellers is to become good listeners and good watchers. And so, at her suggestion, I began to look upon the world itself as the raw materials for stories. Suddenly, the moon, the stars, even the raindrops sliding down the windowpanes, all became imbued with life.
Years ago, parents told stories to children both to entertain them and to teach them about the world's complexities. But we lost the art of storytelling when we lost that sort of open-ended time with our children, the reflecting, wondering, watching time that gives rise to stories. (p. 71)
Where do our children hear most of their stories today? More often than not, they receive their stories from the media, from huge international corporations who need to make a profit, and who do so by "entertaining" us. These mass-produced commercial stories may capture our children's attention, but they will not stir their sense or open their hearts.
The stories we mothers can tell are different. They are food for the soul, and they nourish us, the storytellers, as well as the listeners. Telling a story is really a way of breathing deeply with our children. (p. 72)Someplace deep within me, I carry every story I have ever heard, every story I have ever lived, every story I will ever need.
(p. 77)
How do stories play a part in your lives? I'd love to know! I'll have Mr. Linky up next Friday for your thoughts (and maybe even a story?) (Click here for the posts on Stories)
Click here to be directed to Wants and Needs. (yes, I'm a week behind...)

BPZ Energy is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with license contracts covering approximately 1.9 million net acres in four properties in northwest Peru. The Company is currently listed both on the New York Stock Exchange and Bolsa de Valores in Lima, Peru under the ticker symbol BPZ.
The Company is currently producing oil from the Corvina and Albacora fields at offshore Block Z-1. A 1,600 square kilometer 3D seismic survey, which was initiated in 2012 and completed in early 2013, will better define the exploration and development projects at Block Z-1. In addition, a new CX-15 platform (shown left) has been fabricated and placed at Corvina to begin a drilling campaign to develop its proved undeveloped reserves. Block Z-1 operations are being conducted through a joint venture partnership with Pacific Rubiales Energy.
Onshore, the Company has focused on seismic data acquisition at Blocks XIX, XXII and XXIII to lay the groundwork for exploration drilling in the future. The Company also owns a non operating net profits interest in a producing property in southwest Ecuador.

A to homeowners whose properties are tainted with the corrosive material.
The settlement covers 2,000 to 3,000 homes in Florida, after a class action lawsuit claimed that Banner misled consumers about the product’s safety.
“This is a substantial development in Chinese drywall litigation,” said Ervin Gonzalez, a Miami attorney representing the plaintiffs in the case, in a statement. “It enables Florida homeowners to get some relief from their ongoing Chinese drywall issues.”
Chinese drywall was imported into the United States in large batches after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, in response to a need for the reconstruction of homes. In areas in South Florida like Homestead, Miami and Kendall, new single-family homes were being built, occasionally with drywall from China.
That drywall was later discovered to contain toxins that corroded pipes and electrical wiring, emitted foul odors and allegedly caused headaches and breathing problems.
The discovery led to thousands of lawsuits against manufacturers, distributors and installers of Chinese drywall, including Banner.
Banner claims that it bought the drywall from a German-based manufacturer that lied about the quality of the product. “We are settling this matter to bring a resolution for our customers and to allow the homeowners to fix their homes,” said Michael Peterson, Banner’s counsel, in a statement.
Because Banner Supply Co. provided most of the drywall used in Florida construction, it’s likely that many Manatee County residents will be affected by the preliminary settlement reached today, said Jordan Chaikin, a partner with one of the dozen law firms representing plaintiffs in the class action suit.
“Unfortunately, Manatee County and all the way down to where we are, in Lee County, are the epicenter of the Chinese drywall epidemic,” said Chaikin, a partner with the law firm Parker, Waichman, Alonso LLP, which is based in New York City but has a Florida office in Bonita Springs.
That’s because Southwest Florida had one of the highest appreciating real estate markets between 2004 and 2006, and was also hard-hit by a string of destructive hurricanes. generating lots of construction, Those two factors meant lots of construction -- and lots of contaminated drywall installed in new and renovated homes, Chaikin said. “Domestic manufacturers didn’t have the capability to keep up with demand,” he said.
The Parker law firm represents more than 1,000 Florida plaintiffs in the class-action suit, which will likely involve more than 10,000 people nationwide. A process for distributing proceeds of the $55 million settlement is still in negotiation, Chaikin said.
“If somebody suspects or has confirmed through their builder that they have Chinese drywall and have not retained an attorney to represent them, it’s imperative that they do that immediately,” Chaikin said.
Banner expressed plans to seek damages against manufacturers that sold defective drywall, the company said.
The $54.5 million settlement will be paid out by Banner’s insurers, and it equals the total amount available to the company for drywall related insurance claims, Tuesday’s court filing said.
Those eligible for the most recent settlement will be notified by mail and in various media outlets within 35 days if the settlement is approved by a federal judge in New Orleans.

ECWCS GENERATION III: LEVEL IV
WINDSHIRT “Very Unique”
New Technology:The army issued wind jacket is a very unique clothing item that doesn’t compare to any other product the military has used in the past. You can compare the Generation III silk weight items against the “old school” sleeping shirt. You can compare the level II grid fleece shirts & trousers against the previous military issued thermal underwear. You can also compare the level VI Gore-Tex system against various wet weather garments, but what can you compare a wind shirt against? As far as I’m aware there is no comparison. The wind Jacket is the first of its kind. The wind jacket is loose, airy and very comfortable. Personally, I wouldn’t describe it as a wind breaker because it looks more like a shirt. This explains why it is commonly called the “wind shirt” by soldiers. When I think of the Extended Climate Warfighter Clothing System or ECWCS, I tend to think of extreme cold weather clothing items, but the wind jacket is an odd fit in this package. When I visualize myself using this product I can see me wearing it on a blistering hot day at Ft. Hood Texas or Ft. Sill Oklahoma. It would be ideal in a hot dry setting where the winds were flowing across the plains. Other than an additional layer of clothing, I don’t know how this product fits into a cold weather clothing system. Since I’m somewhat confused by this product I will provide the following information that I found on an official web site: “The GEN III Wind Jacket is designed to act as a low volume shell layer that optimizes the moisture wicking properties of other GEN III insulating and next-to-skin levels. It is also designed to be worn under body armor.”
G.I. Generation III Level IV Wind Shirt:Purchase Windshirt Here - $49.95
• Constructed with MILLIKEN® nylon spandex material with a water resistant finish • Optimizes moisture wicking properties of other GEN III layers • Designed for wear under body armor and with the ACU • Increased wind and sand protection • Extreme low weight and bulk • Angled chest pockets with mesh lining for ventilation • Velcro closure sleeve pockets • Elasticized cuffs • Velcro fasteners for rank and name plates • Color: Universal Camouflage
Why you should have one:Since my days as a soldier are long behind me, I tend to look at the wind jacket for use in many civilian applications. I often wear it camping during the summer or when I’m chopping wood at my friend’s hunting camp in early fall. Its loose airy feel is ideal when I’m overly active. It helps me stay cool and dry, and I simply love the way it feels. Comprised of 100% nylon and made by prestigious companies such as Patagonia, it is obvious this product is well constructed and built to last. Once again, I use this product as a shirt rather than a jacket. When the wind jacket was first introduced it was one of my better selling items. This is especially true for Bradley’s mail order operations. Over the years it has produced excellent customer feedback, and I have recommended it to many customers including soldiers and survivalists. Today demand for the wind shirt has declined, and I don’t know why. It is a good product with reasonable price. For the most part, Bradley’s sells wind jackets to soldiers that lost the item and need to clear the Central Issuing Facility or CIF. I don’t sell many wind shirts to civilians these days. Perhaps it has lost its new exciting image, but I wouldn’t read into this statement. The wind jacket is an outstanding piece of military clothing, and there are many practical applications for it in civilian settings. Overall, I would rate the wind jacket highly. I wish I was able to use it during my years in the Army, and I would recommend it to any soldier. Its loose light fit is very comfortable, and it is money well spent. If you are an elite soldier or rugged survivalist I encourage you to try this product. I’m confident you will like it.

Peugeot, Honda and Selfridges back Children in Need
Brands including Peugeot, Honda and Selfridges are showing support for tonight's Children in Need fundraiser with activity including Peugeot replacing its lion logo with Pudsey Bear.
Peugeot: rolls out Pudsey logo
Peugeot is using an image of the charity mascot to replicate the pose of its longstanding lion logo.
Digital agency CMW created the campaign, which includes Pudsey-branded full-page ads in The Sun, Metro and The Times that will be supported by a "Pudsey takeover" of the car brand's social media properties.
Money will be raised for the charity by the Pudsey's Dream Wheels online game, which allows users to design their own car and make a small donation and enter their design into a competition to win a Peugeot 208.
Rival automotive manufacturer Honda is helping raise money for the charity by selling the motorbike ridden by Daniel Craig in the latest James Bond movie, 'Skyfall', on eBay.
The modified Honda CRF250R motorbike is currently being auctioned on the site and featured in the opening scene of Skyfall where Bond rode across the top of the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul.
Bids for the bike will be open until midnight on Thursday 22 November with Honda hoping tens of thousands of pounds will be raised for charity via the auction.
Meanwhile, retail brands including Selfridges and Paul Smith are also supporting the Children in Need fundraiser.
Selfridges is selling a 10-inch version of Pudsey featuring an S-embossed t-shirt and yellow eyepatch, while designer Paul Smith has designed a Pudsey, which was auctioned at Christies yesterday.
Children in Need is running its flagship fundraising show tonight on BBC One and comes at a time of crisis for the broadcaster as it battles to cope with the fallout from the Jimmy Savile paedophilia scandal...

Apple rejects Greenpeace claims after Cork protest
Apple has rejected Greenpeace’s claims that it is not focused on renewables after activisits this morning staged an hour-long rooftop protest at the computer giant’s European headquarters in Cork.
The environmental group said it was aiming to to raise awareness about the growing use and scale of cloud data centres which store information for customers and companies at a central base housing thousands of computers.
Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace International executive director, said customers of some of the world leading IT and internet companies want to know the companies’ energy policies are sustainable.
“When.
Greenpeace, which praised Apple’s energy policy in Ireland, also staged protests over cloud computing centres in Turkey and Luxembourg. It is angered over the use of coal generated energy for new cloud sites.
Iris Cheng, campaigner from Greenpeace International, said some major IT companies are not innovative enough about how they power their centres.
“Coal is one of the dirtiest fuels on the planet, causing untold damage to the environment and global climate,” she said.
“A company that prides itself for its vision and innovation should not be using outdated polluting coal.
“The irony here in Cork is that Apple’s HQ is powered by renewable energy sources. The much needed jobs this HQ provides to the local community are also increasing the jobs in the Irish renewable energy sector. Apple has shown it can power with clean energy in Cork, it is now time to clean up globally.” homes.
The report, How Clean is Your Cloud?, found that if the cloud were a country its electricity demand would rank fifth in the world and is expected to triple by 2020.
However Apple said its new data centre in North Carolina will draw about 20 megawatts of power at full capacity and ultimately 60% of its energy from on-site renewables including the largest solar farm and fuel cell generator of thier kind in the US.
A separate site due to open next year in Oregon will be run 100% on renewables.
Apple also said it buys all its energy for the Cork plant from a renewable supplier.

Monitor reveals slight drop in number of job vacancies08/05/2012 - 10:00:43
The number of job opportunities in Ireland decreased slightly during the past month, according to the Morgan McKinley Irish Employment Monitor.
The Monitor reported that the number of new professional job vacancies fell by 4%, from just over 9,200 in March to over 8,900 in April.
However, the number of job opportunities in April rose year-on-year by 5% compared to the same time last year.
Karen O’Flaherty, Chief Operations Officer at Morgan McKinley, said: "Professional job opportunities saw a small month-on-month decline in April 12. This reduction is likely to be a reaction to the ongoing economic domestic uncertainty coupled with the recent European updates of double dip recession.
"Seasonally it is also typical to expect protracted decision making around the Easter and holiday period."
She went on to say that they are seeing "scattered pockets" of hiring within the pharmaceutical, manufacturing and IT sectors - namely Amgen, Mylan and Cisco.
Ms O'Flaherty said: "Positively, professionals are becoming more mobile and flexible in looking for alternative employment and employers are more conscious of the need to offer attractive and enticing remuneration packages to secure this talent.
"April 12 saw a 15% decrease in professionals emerging in to the Irish jobs market. This can be largely attributed to the reduced momentum over the Easter period. The surge of 63% compared to April 11 is a positive sign that passive job seekers are now beginning to explore the jobs market.
"The recent amendments to the draft AWD (Agency Workers Directive) bill, is welcome news for contract and temporary workers in Ireland. We hope that this legislation when enacted, will alleviate the uncertainty and concerns around potential hiring by employers and will not stunt job growth in Ireland in the coming months."

Greeks launch migrants crackdown06/08/2012 - 12:10:00
Around 6,000 suspected illegal immigrants have been arrested during a huge sweep in Athens.
Police said they will deport more than 1,600 of them to their home countries.
Those arrested and awaiting deportation have been sent to temporary holding centres. The rest were freed. Some 4,500 police took part in the weekend roundups.
Greece is Europe’s main entry point for illegal immigrants from Asia and Africa, who are seeking a better life in the West.
Some 100,000 are estimated to slip into Greece every year, mostly from neighbouring Turkey, and the influx has coincided with a rise in crime.

Killed Soldier Warned Obama's Afghanistan Strategy Needlessly Endangering Troops Print Article Send a Tip by AWR Hawkins 17 Oct 2012 post a comment Young (R-FL) to describe the conditions under which he was fighting and the types of duties he and his men were being asked to undertake. In that correspondence, SSG Sitton wrote: I feel myself and my soldiers are being put into unnecessary positions where harm and danger are imminent. There is no...purpose for the patrols given to us for our chain of command, only that we will be out for a certain time period. We are walking around aimlessly through grape rows and compounds that are littered with explosives. Again, this is limited war at its best, which is limited war at its worst. Instead of using large weapons to level the compounds and areas around the grape rows, we are sending soldiers out on foot to walk through places riddled with IEDs which explode under the pressure of a human foot. SSG Sitton's mother says her son told her that he and his men were given a certain amount of foot patrols they had to perform in such areas over a certain amount of time. She recalled he said they frequently had to "patrol in urine and feces soaked uniforms" just to meet the foot-patrol quota -- but no clear objective or end for the patrols was ever given. As pointless as these endeavors appeared to SSG Sitton, he wrote that he remained "totally on board with sacrifice for [his] country." If we leave Afghanistan prematurely, it will become even more of a terrorists' safe haven than it already is. However, if we keep our men and women in uniform there without allowing them to fight to win, we will have committed an even worse offense than allowing Afghanistan to return to the terrorists. God bless men like Staff Sergeant Matthew Sitton. God bless his mother, and the mothers of all those who are off to war. Comments

A Word of Thanks to the MSM (I Have Greatest Job In the World) by John Nolte 8 Feb 2013 post a comment Share This: Who would've ever thought that someday I'd be paid actual real-live money to wake up every morning to ridicule, expose and go to war with the most hypocritical, dishonest, snobby, bigoted out-of-touch, provincial, mean-girl institution allowed to operate legally in America. And the media makes my job so easy. The media's so consistently awful, there just aren't enough hours in the day to cover all the material. Post-election, the job's only gotten more amusing. The media's one-ness with Obama is now completely out of the closet as this hive-mind collective comes together to protect Their Precious One from his faltering economy and all the scandal surrounding Libya. Oh, and watching the same media that spent weeks falsely linking Sarah Palin to Tucson now cover-up their own connection to this suspected mass murderer terrorizing Los Angeles… Just wow. And to think, if the media hadn't set the rules for milking human tragedy to score political points, yesterday might have been a total bust. Don't you ever change, Mainstream Media! Comments

Another important message from a Hagel supporter by Joel B. Pollak 22 Feb 2013 post a comment Share This: What is it about Hagel that attracts these people? And will any Democrat speak out against them? From the mailbag. Subject: Bunch of crybabies Pollak and Shapiro, grow up and be real men. You just don't want to lose the Hagel battle since you've invested so much ego energy in fighting his nomination. There are so many more important battles to fight but it seems like most of your passion is defending the racist state of Israel. That's why your a blog not a real news website. You're still young synagogue boys trying to act like your tough. You grew up in Los Angeles right. How much time have you spent on Skid Row or in Compton? Bunch of wimpy Jewish suburban boys from rich homes with college degrees. How about a semester in Afghanistan? Naw, you'd rather serve in the IDF killing innocent Palestinian women and children fighting for their land and freedom. Comments

International Arms Race: The Result

..
- James,
I have a bottle of the BrewDog IRA in hand. On one side it says "made with barley, hops, yeast, water," however on the other side it says "'Zero IUB IPA' is an IPA beer using no hops. The hops are replaced with berries, herbs, and roots" Labling fail? I loved the BrewDog version, sadly my wife loved the Flying Dog version...Christopsy03.09.2012
- James
Where about on the label is the full list of ingredients on the label text on the bottle ?concerned03.09.2012
- I really enjoyed the concept, and thanks for putting it on. Hope you do more in future. Unfortunately I didn't like either beer, both pretty gross, but the no hop idea was worth a shot.PeterG03.09.2012
- Epic events, cool people and killer beers.
thanks for bringing all the cool flying dog stuff
Adrian M03.09.2012
- All the wee doggies leaping to the defense of there master.....Ahhhhhhhhhhneepheed03.09.2012
- enjoyed both beers in glasgow, i would certainly buy both again \m/ \m/
James, quick question, whats the chances of "hello, my name is ingrid" being brewed soon as i miss that cheeky wee beer : )9double903.09.2012
- the format of the event in Camden was just so much find. Blind tasting, customers voting, brewers going head to head on the bar top.
just a brilliant night - thanks to all who helped put it together
Mad Max03.09.2012
- The event at Glasgow was amazing - wicked music and sooo cool to meet the Flying Dog guys. Loved Pearl Necklace.Amy K03.09.2012
- Loved them both. Especially the brewdog one! It is also the favourite beer of my wife. Just bought 24 bottles online - making sure to stock up before it is all gone!
Craft Beer Junkie03.09.2012
- The full list of ingredients was in the label text on the bottle.James, BrewDog03.09.2012
- A full list of ingredients in beer is not a legal requirement in the UK. It should be, but that's a different story. I thought they were both decent, without such a vital ingredient they were both very interesting. @concerned - Just to be safe I suggest you never eat or drink again.Wee Jimmy03.09.2012
- Which one was which? I voted for no. 2 in MancBreakbeat03.09.2012
- You'd have though an accurate list of ingredients a legal requirement.... a little concerned.concerned03.09.2012
- James
You did not bother to put a list of ingredients on your label, unless you only used water, yeast and barley. I wonder how many of your customers will buy these again, time will tell.
Brewdog bars too far away and expensive for me im afraid.hellboy03.09.2012
- Thought the brewdog one was excellent, very tasty. Liked the flying dog but not nearly as goodMarcRitchie03.09.2012
- @hellboy - we did not cheat and put hops in it - we just forgot to remove hops from our standard ingredient list on the label.
Sorry if the beers were not for you. We (and load of our customers) loved them and loved the whole process behind them.
If you visit one of our bars, our team will be happy to give you some tasters, talk about our beers to you and find something more suited to your tastes.
James, BrewDog03.09.2012
- What was the overall opinion of these beers, I though they were awful. Would never buy again.
and brewdog cheated, they put hops in theirs.hellboy03.09.2012
- I don't know how flying dog won that as their beer was mince prepared to the Brewdog one. Backhanders me thinks.Bebop198003.09.2012

Move on…
I wasn’t going to post anything because I’ve tried to avoid the whole Lance/Oprah thing as much as possible. I’m not really going to talk about it. I just wanted to rant a little (surprise surprise) about the whole “sensation” stirred up on news and social media.
I don’t want to watch anyone’s downfall. I can’t relish in it. No matter how “bad” a person is, I’m not happy to see anyone fail, get thrown under a bus, be executed (figuratively or literally- talking all levels of bad here), or fall from any sort of grace. It doesn’t make me happy to see Lance Armstrong get any sort of comeuppance for actions or lies of his past. I feel uncomfortable when I see/hear people celebrating societal and/or physical revenge on someone.
Right now, I’m more concerned with the war on little black ants in my kitchen that’s now spilling over to my computer desk (before you say anything, yes, I feel bad when ants die, too, but I feel worse when I find one crawling on my arm while I’m typing). I’m more concerned with finding a suitable partner for PMBAR and Double Dare so I can enter the series for a chance to vie for the title of Queen of Pisgah. I am concerned with the two more days of hard training I need to complete before my WCCX taper starts- both a relief, because I’m exhausted, and a stress, because after Sunday, I’ve built what I can, and I can’t build any more. I have way too many things to keep me busy to mess with celebrating a confession that was pointlessly obvious in the first place.
Hey, everyone, I’m real sorry to have to tell you this, but I have a mohawk and more than one tattoo. I tried to cover it up forever, but I’m ready to come clean and admit my propensity towards bad hairstyles and permanent body art.
If you want to quit re-hashing the past and talk about something current, follow @lauren1717 on Twitter. She’s posted a lot of great links to articles about the current plight of women’s pro cycling.
As long as you didn’t trying and destroy anybody’s life while hiding the hair and tattoo things, we can forgive you and move on.
Comment by Tom K — January 19, 2013 @ 8:20 am
Andrea destroys the lives of others everytime you blows up a Strava record on a recovery ride, when she passes “hardcore mountain bikers” on the trail on her cx bike, when she passes roadies on the road on her mountain bike. The list goes on. Sorry Tom K but Andrea crushes souls like Nicki Minaj crushes ear drums.
Comment by BeanPoleMatt — January 19, 2013 @ 9:21 am
Come to Pisgah! I traveled from Oxford and Memphis for multiple PMBARs and a Double Dare when living in the “mid-south.” Eric’s events are too much fun. Don’t avoid these great events and even better trails if a “perfect” partner doesn’t surface. Ill be out there again this year and can’t wait.

Chandler Named State Pitcher Of The Year; Snow Also Named To First Team
Bridgewater College's Kevin Chandler has been named the VaSID State College Division Pitcher of the Year in voting by the state's sports information directors.
Chandler, who just completed his senior year on the diamond, earned the first ever College Division Pitcher of the Year honor after leading the Old Dominion Athletic Conference in total innings (84.1), complete games (5) and wins (8). He finished the year with an 8-1 mark and a 2.77 ERA, good enough to earn ODAC Pitcher of the Year honors and a spot on the ABCA South Region First Team.
Joining Chandler on the all-state first team was classmate Devon Snow. Snow finished his senior season with a .381 batting average to rank No. 11 in the ODAC. He led the ODAC with 189 at-bats and 72 base hits. He tied for the conference lead in stolen bases with 21. He also ranked fifth in the ODAC in doubles with 17.
Two more Bridgewater College pitchers – Robert Gallet and Corey Armentrout - earned second-team all-state honors.
Gallet finished his sophomore campaign with a 5-2 record and one save. The second-team All-ODAC pick posted a 2.93 ERA.
Armentrout was 4-4 in his first year on the mound for the Eagles. He ranked third in the ODAC with a 2.02 ERA and led the conference in strikeouts with 61. Opponents hit just .185 against the lefty as he also led the ODAC in opponents' batting average against.

Waiting for Results
Faced with our imagination’s world of “what if,” it’s natural to want to know your results immediately once you’ve taken a test or undergone a procedure. Sometimes, that’s possible. But in most cases, the results need additional analysis or interpretation.
The hematology laboratory, for example, is likely to subject your blood samples to a variety of tests, some of which may take days to complete; specialized radiologists may interpret your echocardiogram, MRI or CT scan; an electrophysiologist may evaluate your heart rhythms. Those specialists will forward their reports to your doctor, who may take some additional time to consider how to use the information in planning your treatment.
Handling the Uncertainty
When you’re scheduled for a test, ask when and from whom you will receive the results. If possible, make an appointment to discuss those results with your doctor. Knowing when you’ll be notified can eliminate at least one source of anxiety.
If you’re apprehensive about what your results are going to reveal, talk to your doctor or nursing staff. They’ll be able to suggest techniques or medications that will help to relieve the stress and anxiety of waiting and wondering without harming your heart.

LaRue Across America: Postcards From the Vacation
Book Source: Review copy from publisher
"Dear Mrs. Hibbins,
My ship has sailed, and with it all hopes of a pleasant resolution to this unhappy saga. Traveling instead by car, we have left the coast far behind. I see now why the ship's captain, in his wisdom, refused to accept cats. The creatures simply do not travel well!"
With a name like LaRue, you're bound to hit the road on a cross-country adventure at least one or twice in your life. In LaRue Across America, the hilarious letter-writing pup, Ike LaRue is all ready for the perfect summer vacation -- a cruise to Mexico with his owner, Mrs. LaRue. Unfortunately, the neighbor lady ends up in the hospital and kindhearted Mrs. LaRue offers to take care of her two cats until she recovers.
The cats aren't allowed on the cruise ship, so Mrs. LaRue decides that a cross-country vacation across America is a nice alternative. Ike, not at all excited about the car trip with two cats, writes a series of desperate letters to Mrs. Hibbins during the trip, urging her to "end the fiasco" and take her cats back. The group departs from Snort City, N.Y., and they stop in several states (New York, Connecticut, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Arizona) before reaching Death Valley, California, an unfortunate place to visit in the middle of July. LaRue nearly gives up hope for a happy end to a "terrible journey."
Everyone that has endured a trip with bickering family members will be able to sympathize with Ike and the cats. The canine and felines fight over beds, cause disruptions at landmarks, and cheat at road games. Ike even pulls the "my side, your side" stunt by dividing the back seat with masking tape to mark territory. It's a classic cats versus dogs storyline, paired with some great illustrations by the talented Teague. All the images of the cats taunting Ike are super funny!
I printed off a blank map of America for my daughter to color in as we read the book together. In total, Ike stops in 12 states. The book provided her with a fun way to explore our country and learn about the location of various states.
Scholastic has graciously offered to give away (2) copies of LaRue Across America to two different readers.

Thomas ArcherArticle Free Pass. After receiving several lucrative royal appointments, he bought the manor of Hale, Hampshire, in 1715 and rebuilt the house and church.
Archer’s dynamic work borrowed much from the 17th-century Italian architects Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Francesco Borromini. Although he was not as original as some of the prominent English architects of his time, he was considered important. Most of his designs were executed from 1705 to 1715, including the north front of Chatsworth House (c. 1705) in Derbyshire, Heythrop House (1707–10) in Oxfordshire, a garden pavilion at Wrest Park (1709–11) in Bedfordshire, Roehampton House (c. 1712) in Surrey (now in Wandsworth, London), and the churches of St. Philip (c. 1710–15) in Birmingham, St. Paul (1712–30) in Deptford, and St. John (1713–28) in Westminster. The last two resulted from his appointment in 1711 as a commissioner for the building of 50 new churches.

Miyazawa KiichiArticle Free Pass
Miyazawa Kiichi, (born Oct. 8, 1919, Tokyo, Japan—died June 28, 2007, Tokyo), prime minister of Japan from 1991 to 1993.
Born into a family of politicians, Miyazawa graduated in law from Tokyo Imperial University in 1941 and soon secured a civilian position in the finance ministry (1942–52). In 1953 he was elected to the Diet (parliament) and in 1962 secured his first cabinet position, as director general of the Economic Planning Agency. Subsequently Miyazawa served as minister of international trade and industry (1970–71), of foreign affairs (1974–76), and of finance (1986–88). He also acted as cabinet secretary in the early 1980s and, briefly, as deputy prime minister in Takeshita Noboru’s cabinet.
Like other senior politicians in the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP), Miyazawa was tainted by the bribery scandals that rocked the Japanese establishment, and he was forced to resign as finance minister in December 1988. He soon returned to power, however, and, after being elected president of the LDP on Oct. 27, 1991, he took over as prime minister on November 5. His reascension in the early 1990s tended to mark a return to old-style politics. Nevertheless, he proved unable to unite or control the warring factions within the LDP. In June 1993 some of these factions joined with opposition parties to pass a vote of no confidence. Miyazawa was forced to resign as prime minister, and in the ensuing general elections the LDP lost control of the Diet for the first time in its 38-year history. He later served as finance minister (1998–2001), and he remained a member of the Diet until 2003.

British Go Journal No. 19. January 1973. Page 9.
Sakakibara, 8d
This series is aimed at players of l0-kyu to 5-kyu strength. It consists of examples and hints which cover many fundamental situations.
The meaning of this proverb will become apparent later. Dia 1 shows a basic corner position. White has just played 1. How do you play now?
Black 2 in Dia 2 is a perfect example of a horribly bad move, which is often played by beginners. It is a tsuki-atari (it bangs into Whites position). You should notice that white 1 and 3 and the stone already there form the hane at the head of two stones in a row - c.f. Go Proverbs by Segoe.
Let us consider the position after black 6. White has at least 10 points of territory and considerable influence along the side. Black has played the same number of stones and has only six points of territory and no influence. Furthermore a white approach to A would put Blacks position under attack. Blacks troubles stem from 2, a very bad move.
In Dia 3 Black plays 2, a tsuki-atari towards the edge and the sequence up to 4 is the start of the nadare joseki, as you probably know.
In Dia 4. when White attacks to the outside, Blacks tsuki-atari 2 is the correct way to play.
In conclusion we see the tsuki-atari of Dias 3 and 4 are the correct way to play. The direction of both these moves is towards the edge. In Dia 2 the tsuki-atari is in the opposite direction, towards the centre, and is a poor move. Blacks resultant position is inefficient.
The kake-tsugi is a diagonal connection, e.g. black 2 and 4 of Dia 5. In Dia 5 black 4 is an example of bad play. White has played an outer attach, 1, and a drawback, 3 (tsuke-hiki). Black 4, a kake-tsugi, is played into the corner, but is in the wrong direction.
Compare this with Dia 6. White 1 is an inner attach and finally Black plays 4, a kake-tsugi, towards the side. In Dia 6, black is promised possibilities of growth, by playing at A or B - his direction for further play is along the side. In Dia 5, black has little potential - he is bottled up in the corner.
In fact, Black should have played as in Dia 7. White will cut, either on the inside or the outside, but this is quite alright for black.
This example will to grasp the new which we have just studied.
Dia 8 shows a common position in handicap Go. White plays the attachment 1 and black 2 is a tsuke-atari towards the centre (a bad move). Black hasnt secured all his territory on the left side, and has managed to strengthen white. There is of course no need to play the tsuke-atari. Black 1 in Dia 9 is good and black 3 is much better than the result of Dia 8.

that separates Cardigan bay from the bay of Carnarvon. It is bounded on the north by the parishes
of Llanelhairn and Clynnog, on the south by the
parish of Llanarmon, on the east by those of Llanvihangel-y-Pennant and Llanystyndwy, and on the
west by that of Carngiwch; and comprises 4306 acres,
of which 1705 are arable, 2571 meadow and pasture,
and 30 woodland, consisting principally of oak, ash,
and larch. The soil, to a considerable extent, is
moist and gravelly, producing chiefly barley, oats,
and potatoes; the lands are mostly inclosed, and in a
good state of cultivation. The surface is generally
level, and the surrounding scenery is pleasingly
diversified, comprising some fine views of the adjacent
country, which is watered by several small streams,
and abounds with varied and picturesque beauty. In
the parish is the residence of Trallwyn; also an old
mansion named Glasfryn, lately restored, and now
inhabited. The Carnarvon and Pwllheli turnpikeroad runs through the parish, which has also good
cross-roads.
The living is a rectory, with that of Llanarmon
annexed, rated in the king's books at £15.3.4.;
present net income, £450; patron, the Bishop of
Bangor. The tithes of Llangybi have been commuted for a rent-charge of £226. 10. The church is
a spacious structure, consisting of a nave, chancel,
and north aisle, and measuring fifty-nine feet in
length and seventeen and a half in breadth; in 1828
it underwent a thorough repair, the roof being raised
and new windows inserted, and it is now one of the
best ecclesiastical edifices in this part of the county.
There are places of worship for Calvinistic Methodists and Independents, and three Sunday schools.
An almshouse was founded in 1760, by William
Price, Esq., of Rhiwlas, who endowed it with a rentcharge payable out of the estate of Pentyrch Uchâv,
for six poor men, who receive £1 per quarter, with a
sufficient allowance of fuel, and are nominated by
Rice Thomas, Esq., of Coed Helen, heir of the
founder: the six houses are substantially built of
stone, but the almspeople do not reside in them,
letting them to the parish officers at 25s. each. The
Rev. Evan Griffith, in 1724, bequeathed £100,
directing the proceeds to be annually distributed
among the poor of this parish and Llanarmon. Near
the church is a fine chalybeate spring, called Fynnon Gybi, inclosed with a stone wall, and having
stone seats round it; the water was formerly in great
repute for its efficacy in the cure of scorbutic complaints, and is still found beneficial in chronic cases.
On the summit of Garn Pentyrch, or Garn Llangybi,
a high conical hill, is a very extensive and perfect
ancient British encampment.
LLANGYBI (LLAN-GYBI), a parish, in the
union of Lampeter, Upper division of the hundred
of Moythen, county of Cardigan, South Wales,
4 miles (N. N. E.)from Lampeter; containing 274
inhabitants. It lies upon the road from Lampeter
to Trêgaron; and is bounded on the north by the
parish of Llandewy-Brevi, on the south by that of
Bettws-Bledrws, on the east by that of LlanvairClydogan, and on the west by the chapelry of Gartheli, in Llandewy-Brevi. The lands, which are
watered by the river Dulas, are in general inclosed,
and the soil is tolerably fertile, producing good barley
and oats. The place constituted a prebend in the
ancient collegiate church of Llandewy-Brevi, rated in
the king's books at £1. 6. 8. The living is a perpetual curacy, endowed with £800 royal bounty; net
income, £60; patrons, alternately, Lord Carrington
and Captain G. L. Vaughan, the impropriators,
whose tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge
of £90. The church, dedicated to St. Cybi, is a
small edifice, consisting only of a nave and chancel.
There are places of worship for Calvinistic Methodists, Independents, and Presbyterians: the last is
supposed to be the most ancient congregation of dissenters in the principality, having first assembled
here about the year 1663. Two Sunday schools are
supported by the Independents, and one by the Methodists. On a hill above the river Teivy is a large
intrenchment, called Castell Goedtrêv; it gives name
to the farm on which it is situated.
LLANGYNHAVAL (LLAN-GYNHAFAL),
a parish, in the union and hundred of Ruthin, county
of Denbigh, North Wales, 4 miles (N. by E.)
from Ruthin; containing 502 inhabitants. This parish, which derives its name from the dedication of
its church to St. Cynhaval, who flourished about the
beginning of the seventh century, is situated in the
rich and fertile Vale of Clwyd, and sheltered by the
fine range of mountains which bounds the vale and
parish on the east. It is traversed by the road from
Ruthin to Holywell, and bounded on the north by the
parish of Llangwyvan, on the south by that of Llanbedr, on the east by that of Kîlken, and on the west
by the parishes of Llanynys and Llanychan. It comprises by admeasurement 2300 acres, of which 1000
are mountainous, and nearly all the remainder arable.
The scenery is diversified and highly picturesque,
and the views over the adjacent country abound with
interesting features. A very considerable portion of
the parish is uninclosed and uncultivated, but of the
rest the soil is sandy, and the chief produce is barley.
Among the many gentlemen's seats sprinkled over
the Vale of Clwyd, that of Plâs-Draw, situated in
this parish, is considered the most beautiful; PlâsIssa, also, a modern mansion, is elegantly built.
The living is a discharged rectory, rated in the
king's books at £15. 15.; patron, the Bishop of Bangor: the tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge
of £400, and there is a glebe of thirteen acres and a
half, valued at £20 per annum; also a glebe-house.
The church is a neat whitewashed edifice, sixty feet
long and forty-two wide, and contains 400 sittings;
it occupies a pleasant situation in the centre of the
parish, and commands an extensive and beautiful view
of the vale. There is a place of worship for Calvinistic Methodists. A Church school is supported,
and two Sunday schools; one of these latter is in
connexion with the Church, and the other with the
Calvinistic body. Thomas Roberts bequeathed £43
to the poor, Edward Wynn £20, Strange Pedler £10,
and John Doulben £10, which, together with some
smaller benefactions, have been invested in the purchase of a portion of land called Gevel-y-Pwll, producing £7. 7. per annum. William Wynne, in 1723,
left the interest of £100, which is now paid out of a
large farm called Plâsynllan, and applied towards the
support of the above-mentioned day school; and a few
other annual charities of small amount, together with
the produce of the land already named, are distributed on St. Thomas's day and Good Friday among
the poor. In the chain of hills by which the parish
is bounded on the east, the highest, called Moel
Vammau, is surmounted by a column erected to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the accession of
George III.
LLANGYNIDER (LLAN-GYNIDR), a parish, in the union and hundred of Crickhowel,
county of Brecknock, South Wales, 4 miles (N.
W.) from Crickhowel; containing 2775 inhabitants, of
whom 2110 are in the hamlet of Blaen, 542 in that
of Vro, and 123 in the hamlet of Dyfryn. This place
derives its name from the dedication of its church
to St. Cynyd, or Cynydr, who lived in religious
seclusion in Glamorgan, in the sixth century, and in
commemoration of whom a festival was annually celebrated here, on the 1st of August. In ancient records it is frequently called "Llan-Gynyd-EglwysYail," from the Yail, a small stream that passed near
the church; and "Llan-Gynyd-Eglwys-Vesey," from
an old chapel, of which the ruins were formerly
visible on the bank of the Crawnon, about two miles
from the village. The parish extends from the
southern bank of the Usk to the confines of Monmouthshire and Glamorgan, and is bounded on the
north by that river, which separates it from the parish
of Llanvihangel-Cwm-Dû. On the south-west it is
bounded by the river Romney, which divides it from
the parish of Gellygaer, in the county of Glamorgan;
on the south by the parish of Bedwelty, in the shire
of Monmouth; and on the west by the parish of
Llanthetty. It comprises by recent admeasurement
13,992 acres, of which about 8000 are mountain land
affording pasturage to large flocks of sheep, and the
remainder inclosed arable and pasture, with some
wood. The adjacent country is finely varied, in
some parts beautifully picturesque; and the view
of the mountains by which the parish is surrounded
is strikingly beautiful: among these, the lofty conical
mountain called the Sugar Loaf, on the border and
within the limits of Monmouth, and the Irvol, or
Hirvoel, commonly called Durvoel, in the adjoining
parish of Llanthetty, partly clothed with larch-trees
of stately growth, are prominent and interesting features. The soil is light, inclining in some parts to
gravel, and in others well adapted for wheat and barley, the latter of which is produced of superior
quality.
In the mountain district bordering on the counties
of Monmouth and Glamorgan, and from six to nine
miles distant from the parish church, a vast increase
of population has taken place, occasioned by the residence of miners and colliers belonging to works situated in the adjoining parishes. The parish abounds
with iron-ore, coal, and limestone; and on the river
Romney are some iron-works, conducted by the Bute
Iron Company, and giving employment to between
300 and 400 men. The Brecknock and Abergavenny canal, extending from Pontymoel, near Pontypool, in Monmouthshire, to Brecknock, traverses
the lower part of the parish, and on its banks is a
wharf for lime and coal. The tramroad commonly
called the Trivel Road, communicating with the canal
at Tàlybont, in the parish of Llanthetty, passes along
the Trivel mountain in this parish; and the lower part
of Llangynider is traversed by the turnpike-road
leading from Llangattock to Brecknock. Fairs are
annually held in the village, by prescriptive right, on
April 20th, October 7th, December 1st, and the
Wednesday before Christmas-day.
The living is a rectory, rated in the king's books
at £13. 14. 7.; present net income, £418; patron,
the Duke of Beaufort. The church, a plain small
edifice, situated in the hamlet of Vro, consists of a
nave and chancel, and contains about 240 sittings:
the parsonage-house was erected at the expense of the
Rev. William Davies, the incumbent. There are
places of worship for Baptists, Independents, and
Calvinistic and Wesleyan Methodists; a day school
in connexion with the Church, built by Mr. Bailey,
M.P.; and about twelve Sunday schools, one of which
is conducted on Church principles. Mrs. Frances
Griffiths, in 1761, left £10, the interest of which is
divided annually, on Easter-eve, among the poor not
receiving parochial relief; and Miss Sarah Prytherch,
in 1787, bequeathed £8 per annum, payable out of a
farm in the parish, to be distributed on the first of
January, by the minister and churchwardens.
It is believed that a Roman vicinal road from
Caerphilly to Bedwelty, and thence over Bedwelty
common, upon which are manifest and unequivocal
traces of a causeway, leading through the mines of
Bryn Oer to Llanvrynach, in the Vale of Usk, passed
along the high ridge of the Trivel Ddû mountain, in
the parish. On this mountain, some time ago, a celt
was found, which was in the possession of the late
Archdeacon Payne. Near the source of the river
Romney is a ford called Rhŷd-y-Milwyr, or "the
soldiers' ford," but from what circumstance it obtained that appellation is unknown. On the Trivel
Glâs mountain is a large natural cavern, termed Stabl
Vawr, or "the great stable," above which is a large
heap of stones, most probably raised as a beacon, as,
upon examination, no sepulchral deposit was found
beneath it, denoting it a cairn. Tradition points out
the site of an ancient castle near the high road to
Brecknock; but nothing of its history is recorded, and
probably it was only a lodge for the residence of a
forester under the lords of Trêtower castle.
LLANGYNIEW (LLAN-GYNYW), a parish,
in the union of Llanvyllin, Lower division of the
hundred of Mathraval, county of Montgomery,
North Wales, 2 miles (N. by W.) from LlanvairCaereinion; containing 647 inhabitants. It derives
its name from the dedication of its church to St.
Cynyw, an eminent British saint, who flourished in
the sixth century, and was son of Gwynlliw, and
brother of Catwg the Wise. That it is of remote antiquity is quite evident from the numerous
British encampments, apparently of the very earliest
character, which are scattered over the hills in
various parts of the parish; and that it was two vales is the spot
where the ancient Roman that had been occupied by the Romans.
On the opposite side of the river, in a wood called
Gwern Ddû, is a circular intrenchment; and in a
field beyond it is a circular mount: both these.ys, the
best era of Welsh poetry, composed on those occasions some of their finest odes, of which many are
preserved in the Welsh Archæology.
After the removal of the seat of government to
Castell Powys, the palace of Mathraval, which was
deserted by the Princes of Powys, fell into the possession of Robert Vipont, a powerful baron in high
favour with John, King of England, who rebuilt, or
at least repaired and fortified, the ancient castle. In
1212, Llewelyn ab Iorwerth, Prince of North Wales,
having made an incursion into Powysland, invested
the castle here,. At the same time, in order to prevent any similar attempt on the part of that prince,
the king ordered the castle to be burnt to the ground,
since which period it has been in ruins.
The parish is situated nearly in the centre of
the county,, and separate this parish from
the parishes of Llanvihangel and Meivod. It extends nearly four miles in length, and from a mile
and a half to three miles in breadth; and comprises
by admeasurement 4440 acres, of which, by computation, 1300 are arable, 1600 pasture, 1060 meadow,
and the remainder woodland. Nearly three-fourths
of the lands are old inclosures; the rest was inclosed
under the provisions of an act obtained in 1810, which
extended also to the adjoining parish of LlanvairCaereinion, and part of that of Castle-Caereinion.
The surface is greatly undulated, rising in many
places into hills of considerable elevation; and the
scenery, which is strikingly diversified, is enriched
in several parts with woods of luxuriant growth, and
enlivened by the branches of the river Vyrnwy. At
Mathraval Fridd and Park are not less than 350
acres of woodland, containing some of the finest oaktrees in the county, which is much celebrated for that
species of timber: many of the young trees, not more
than nine inches in girth at the butt, are sixty feet in
height, and for cleaving are thought to be among
the best in the kingdom; while those of more mature
growth are unrivalled in the stateliness of their appearance, forming a majestic feature in the scenery
of the place. From several of the hills, which are
generally of conical form, are some noble and magnificent views over the surrounding country, comprehending the most picturesque portion of the
district called Powysland. From the summit of
Penyborth, in the hamlet of Cynhinva, more especially, is a prospect remarkable for its extent and
grandeur. Towards the east are seen the open and
fertile plains of Salop, soil in the arable land is loamy, in the meadow loamy and alluvial, and clayey in the pasture
and woodland; the chief produce of the parish is oats,
barley, wheat, peas, and butter and cheese. There
are several small turbaries, which formerly supplied
the inhabitants with fuel, but that. The parish contains
four corn-mills, in each of which about three hands
are employed.
The living is a rectory, rated in the king's books
at £5. 13. 4.; present net income, £336, with a
glebe-house; patron, the Bishop of St. Asaph. The
church, dedicated to St. Cyniw, and situated at the
eastern extremity of the parish, near the bank of the
Banwy, is a venerable structure in the early style
of English architecture, measuring forty-nine feet by
twenty-one, and containing 177 sittings. It has
the remains of the ancient screen and rood-loft,
embellished with some exquisite carvings in oak, and
in the east window are some small remains of stained
glass; the old font, which is of large dimensions, is
still preserved. In the churchyard are six venerable
yew-trees. There are places of worship for Independents and Calvinistic Methodists; a Church day
school, and three Sunday schools, one of which is in
connexion with the Church. Some minor charitable
donations and bequests have been made by various
individuals, the produce arising from which, amounting to £6. 16., is annually distributed in small sums
among the poor of the parish; but the principal
bequest, a rent-charge of £5, by Samuel Home, in
1804, is partly distributed in coal, on St. Thomas's
day. inclosed area is about two acres in
extent, and each side of it about 120 yards in length;
at the north-eastern angle, which impends over the
river, is a lofty exploratory mount, on which probably
was a castelet, commanding a full view up and down
the vale. Several relics of antiquity have been dug
up amid the ruins near this spot, among which were
some tiles having protuberances at one extremity,
apparently to connect them, also some silver dishes,
an old sword, and some silver coins. Within the area
is a farmhouse, situated near the mount, and which,
together with the greater part of the hamlet of Mathraval, belongs to the Powis estate. In the eastern
part of the parish are the remains of two other encampments, forming, with Mathraval, an equilateral
triangle, each of the sides of which is about a mile in
length. One of these encampments, which are
thought to be of British origin, is situated on a
conical hill called Garthen, in the hamlet of Llangyniew, and appears to have been surrounded with
three ramparts of earth and two fosses, inclosing a
circular area 70 yards in diameter within the inner
wall, and 140 yards in diameter within the outer.
The other occupies the summit of a hill in Mathraval
Fridd, and comprises an elliptical area conformable
to the shape of the hill, seventy-two yards in the
longer, and forty-four yards in the shorter, diameter.
It is encircled adjacent country. There
is a very powerful spring in the parish, strongly impregnated with sulphur.
The Rev. Dr. Evans, rector of Llanymynech, and
canon of St. Asaph, was born in this parish, and was
buried in the church, where a marble tablet was
erected to his memory. He was a distinguished
Welsh scholar and critic, and assisted Dr. Burney in
writing his History of Music, and Mr. Edward Jones
in his collection of Welsh airs. Among his papers
was."
LLANGYNOG (LLAN-GYNOG), a parish,
in the union and hundred of Builth, county of
Brecknock, South Wales, 3½ miles (S. S. W.)
from Builth; containing 54 inhabitants. It derives
its name from the dedication of its church to St.
Cynog, an eminent British saint, who suffered martyrdom about the close of the fifth century. The
parish is situated in the northern portion of the
county, on the turnpike-road leading from Brecknock
to Builth; and is bounded on the north by the parish
of Llanddewi'r-Cwm, on the south by that of Gwenddwr, on the east by the county of Radnor, and on
the west by the lofty range of the Eppynt hills. It
comprises about 2000 acres, 1000 of which are comprehended in a dreary and mountainous tract extending beyond the confines of the parish, and the remainder consists of about one-sixth arable, the same
of woodland, and two-thirds of meadow and pasture.
The soil is poor, producing only a little oats and
barley; the farmers depend chiefly on the rearing
of sheep and a few hardy cattle, for which the hilly
grounds afford but inferior pasture. The Eppynt
hills are partly within the parish; and from their
summits extensive views are obtained over the adjacent country: the immediate neighbourhood, through
which runs the small river Dihonwy, exhibits only
wild and mountainous scenery. The living is a perpetual curacy, endowed with £800 royal bounty;
net income, £69; patron, the Bishop of St. David's.
The tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge of
£44, payable to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.
The church, an ancient, mean edifice, possessing no
claim to architectural notice, stands a little eastward
from the mountain road between Brecknock and
Builth, on the brow of the Eppynt hills, in a very
bleak situation, sheltered only by some larch and fir
trees by which the churchyard is surrounded. It is
a remarkably small church, measuring only thirtyone feet and a half, by seventeen feet.
LLANGYNOG (LLAN-GYNOG), a parish,
in the union, and Upper division of the hundred, of
Llanvyllin, county of Montgomery, North
Wales, 8 miles (N. W.) from Llanvyllin; containing
516 inhabitants. This parish derives its name from
the dedication of its church to St. Cynog, the eldest
of the sons of Brychan, Prince of Brycheiniog; he
suffered martyrdom in the fifth century, was buried
at Merthyr-Cynog, in the county of Brecknock, and
was canonized after his death. It is bounded on the
north and east by the county of Denbigh, on the
south by the parish of Hîrnant, on the west by that
of Pennant; and comprises by admeasurement 974a.
3r. 22p. of cultivated land, and by computation 2500
acres of common or waste. The village is beautifully
situated on the turnpike-road from Llanvyllin to
Bala, in a pleasing but narrow vale, watered by the
river Tanat, and sheltered by lofty mountains: there
is a bridge over the stream, on the line of the turnpike-road. The scenery is strikingly diversified,
abounding with features of picturesque beauty, and
of rugged grandeur; and the views over the adjacent
country, on the east comprising part of Denbighshire,
and on the west part of Merioneth, from which latter
the parish is separated by the fine range of the Berwyn mountains, are interesting and extensive. In
the mountainous district of the parish are mines of
lead, quarries of slate, and other mineral works. The
soil is in general fertile in the agricultural part, producing good crops of wheat, barley, oats, and grass;
and peat, which forms the principal fuel of the inhabitants, is found in abundance.
The lead-mines, which are the property of the
Earl of Powis, have been worked for about a century,
and were productive of immense profit to an ancestor
of the present owner..
In the centre of the vein was a breadth of five yards
of clean ore, so pure as to be immediately conveyed
from the mine to the smelting-house, exclusively of
a breadth of several feet on each side, which, being
mixed with spar, required previous dressing to prepare it for smelting. The vein has been worked to
a depth of more than ninety yards, and during a
period of forty years yielded upon the average about
4000 tons of ore annually, producing to its proprietor
a clear yearly revenue of £20,000. About the commencement of the present century this mine, the
working of which had been for some time discontinued as the influx of water rendered it impracticable,
was leased by a company who drove a level beneath
the mine, neglected. Of
late years, however, the old shaft having been reopened, the mine has produced about one hundred
tons of ore annually: the machinery employed is
driven by a stream of water, brought from a distance
of seven miles at a very considerable expense.
At Craig-y-Gribbin, in the parish, are some quarries of excellent blue slate, of a strong and durable
quality, in raising which about three persons are at
present occupied. From the veins of quartz that
pervade the entire mass of the rock in which they
are quarried, they exhibit a rough surface; and some
of the slabs contain beautiful cubes of mundic. These
slates are procured for the supply of the neighbouring
districts, and a small, employing about twenty-six
persons, from which great numbers of slates of similar
quality are obtained, and brought down the steep
declivity of the rock in sledges containing about five
cwt. each, with extreme danger to the persons engaged in this arduous task. When the sledge is
loaded, and drawn to the edge of the declivity, the
conductor sits upon it, passing over his shoulders a
rope which is fastened at each extremity to the front,
and being also assisted with a pole. Then raising
his feet from the ground, he begins his descent down
a narrow winding path, guiding the sledge by opposing his feet to the projecting points of the rock,
which would divert it from its course; governing its
accumulating velocity by pressing firmly with his
feet upon the ground; and sustaining the weight of
the carriage by the rope that passes over his shoulders. Sometimes the guide, passing the rope over
his shoulders as in the former case, instead of sitting
upon the front of the sledge, descends backwards;. The parish contains a woollen manufactory, in which about three persons are employed;
and fairs are annually held in the village on May 6th,
August 9th, and September 3rd.
The living is a discharged rectory, rated in the
king's books at £4. 8. 11½.; patron, the Bishop of
St. Asaph: the tithes have been commuted for £140
payable to the rector, and £2. 5. to the parish-clerk;
and a glebe-house is attached to the benefice, together
with a glebe of six acres and a quarter, valued at £10
per annum. The church, rebuilt in 1790, is fortyeight feet long and twenty broad, and contains 160
sittings. There are places of worship for Independents and Calvinistic and Wesleyan Methodists; a
day school, established in 1847 by some dissenters in
the neighbourhood; and four Sunday schools, one
of them in connexion with the Church. Evan Jones,
in 1797, gave the interest of £20 in support of a
school, and also bequeathed a house for its use; if no
school should be held, he directed the proceeds to be
distributed among the poor. Elizabeth Lloyd, in
1730, left a rent-charge of £2, a moiety to be distributed among the poor of this parish, and the other
moiety among those of Pennant; the sum is accordingly so disposed of, in small sums, every Easter
Monday. A brass celt was found near the village,
some time since. The parish contains a mining
level called Ogov, or "the cave," driven under a
vast depth of slaty rock, and which appears to have
long ceased to be recognised as a work of art.
LLANGYVELACH (LLAN-GYFELACH),
a parish, in the union, and partly within the limits of
the borough, of Swansea, and partly in the hundred
of Llangyvelach, county of Glamorgan, South
Wales, 4 miles (N. by W.) from Swansea; comprising
the townships of Higher and Lower Clâs, Upper and
Lower Mawr, Upper and Lower Pen Derwi, and
Upper and Lower Rhwngdwy Clydach; and containing 9394. The
parish is situated in a district abounding with mineral
wealth; it is more than ten miles in length, and in
many parts six in breadth, comprising 27,305 acres,
of which 7223 are common or waste land. It includes
the western side of the Swansea valley, or Vale of
Tawe, from a short distance above Swansea up to
Pontardawe, and stretches from that side of the
valley as its basis away to the confines of Carmarthenshire. Upon the base-line lie Morriston, a place of
some size, Clydach, and Pontardawe: the first presents the aspect of a manufacturing population, but
at Clydach and Pontardawe, though there are works
at or near each, rural features predominate. The
village of Llangyvelach lies westward of this baseline, and towards the Carmarthen border the surface
is mountainous. Clasemont, the property of Sir
John Morris, Bart., has been taken down; and the
only seat now deserving notice, within the limits of
the parish, is Penlle'rgaer, an elegant residence.
The principal mineral production is coal, which is
procured in large quantities, and the working of
which affords employment to a great part of the
population. The copper-works established here for
the manufacture of ore imported for the purpose, and
the collieries, are conducted by different companies
on a very extensive scale, the former furnishing occupation to more than 1500, and the latter to 2000,
men. The Pontardawe tin-works are situated in a
pleasant part of the vale, a little below the village of
that name, and are now the property of John Parsons, Esq., of Graig Cottage. They were erected
about fourteen years since, at a considerable outlay,
and the number of persons employed is about 140;
the make is about 2000 boxes of tin-plates per
month, and the wages, which are all paid in cash, exceed, with incidentals, £500 monthly. The Swansea
canal intersects the parish, in its course up the western
bank of the river Tawe. In 1847 an act was passed
authorizing the construction of a railway from Nantmelyn, in the parish, to Ynis-y-Mond, in the parish
of Cadoxton, to be called the Swansea and Amman
Junction Railway: it will consist of a main line of
nearly four miles and a half, with above two miles of
branches. A fair is held on March 1st in the village
of Llangyvelach, in which petty sessions for the hundred also take place.
The living is a vicarage, rated in the king's books
at £9. 14. 9½., and in the patronage of the Bishop
of St. David's: the tithes have been commuted for
£1050, of which £845 are payable to the impropriator, and £205 to the vicar. The church, dedicated to
St. Cyvelach, is a very neat and compact structure,
consisting of a nave and chancel, the former rebuilt a
short time ago: the old tower, which still remains, is
detached from the present, as it was from the former,
edifice, standing at a short distance from the nave:
in the sepulchral chapel belonging to the family of
Penlle'rgaer, is an elegant cenotaph of black marble.
The situation of parish-clerk is worth from £70 to
£100 per annum, arising chiefly from a charge of
two shillings and sixpence upon each plough used
on every farm in the parish; it is in the gift of the
Bishop. At Morriston is a separate incumbency;
and another has been lately founded at Clydach, under
the act 6th and 7th Victoria, cap. 37: the latter is in
the gift of the Crown and the Bishop, alternately;
net income, £150. There are places of worship for
Independents, Baptists, Particular Baptists, Calvinistic Methodists, and Unitarians. Day schools are
held in different parts, in connexion with the Church;
and the parish contains eighteen Sunday schools, four
of them conducted on Church principles.
Lewis Thomas, in the year 1642, left a messuage
and tenement called Tîr Bâch, and also a sum of
£20, the produce to be annually divided on Christmas-eve among the poor not receiving parochial aid:
the piece of land contains about ten acres, with a
small cottage, but is not worth more than about £5
per annum; and nothing has been received from the
property since the early part of the present century,
when it is said to have been taken possession of by a
descendant of the testator. In 1733, Mary Williams
bequeathed a rent-charge of £2 for erecting and
maintaining a free school, in the parcel of Rhwngdwy
Clydach, and the sum was paid to a schoolmaster at
Gellyonen until 1808, since which time nothing has
been received, though a school was built by subscription in the place named by the testatrix. Mary
Rogers, in 1789, gave £500, the interest to be expended in clothing six men, and an equal number of
women, at Christmas, and the residue then left to be
retained by the minister for his trouble in seeing the
trust performed; the fund is vested in the three per
cent. reduced annuities, yielding an interest of £19.
13. 6., of which £12 are allotted to the clothing of
three poor men and women in each division of the
parish, and the remainder is paid to the vicar.
Thomas Price, of Penlle'rgaer, bequeathed a rentcharge of £4 on a farm called Abergwenlais, the
amount to be distributed among the poor on Christmas-eve and Good Friday, and he likewise charged
the land with an annual payment of £4. 10. for instructing ten children. A few other small charities
have been either lost or are unproductive; among
which are a bequest by Alexander Amyas of £40, in
1773; a grant of £20 by one of the Penderry family;
and another rent-charge, variously stated at £2, and
£7. 10., on a tenement called Havod, in the parish of
Bettws, county of Carmarthen. Penlle'rgaer, near
the western confines of the parish, is the only place
besides Loughor having any claim to be regarded as
the site of the Roman station Leucarum; its claim
consists partly in its appellation, which may be translated "the camp summit," and partly in the discovery
of fragments of ancient walls, in a situation likely to
have been chosen by the Romans for a military post.
Near the top of Mynydd Maen Coch, in the parish,
is a stone circle called Carn Llêchart, in a state of
almost perfect preservation.—See Morriston, Clâs,
&c.
LLANHAMLLÊCH, or LLAN-AMLLÊCH
(LLAN-AMMWLCH), a parish, consisting of two
divisions, Lower and Upper, in the hundred of Pencelly, union and county of Brecknock, South
Wales, 3 miles (S. E. by E.) from Brecknock; containing 324 inhabitants, of whom 211 are in the hamlet of Llanhamllêch, or Lower division, and 113 in
that of Llêchvaen, or the Upper division. The name
of this parish, signifying the "church on many flat
stones," is in allusion to the strata of the rock on
which the church is built, and the fragments of slate
with which the churchyard abounds. The greater
portion of the parish, together with the advowson of
the living, formed part of the possessions of Sir John
Walbeoffe, one of the companions of Bernard Newmarch in his conquest of the ancient principality of
Brecknock, and remained in the hands of the descendants of that family till it became extinct. In the
reign of James I., the manor and living became the
property of the Powells, with whom they have since
continued.
This parish, which comprises about 1130 acres, is
beautifully situated on the north bank of the river
Usk, and on the turnpike-road from Brecon to Crickhowel, which passes through the village: on the west
it is bounded by the Brynŷch brook. The lands are
chiefly arable; but there are some good meadows near
the Usk, affording excellent pasturage for cattle.
The soil, composed of clay and gravel, is tolerably
fertile, and the inhabitants are principally employed
in agricultural pursuits. The scenery is richly diversified and highly picturesque: the river, in many
parts of its winding course, forms a beautiful feature
in the landscape; and the distant views embrace
many objects of romantic grandeur, among which are
the Brecknockshire Beacons, and the Sugar Loaf
and other mountains in the county of Monmouth.
Peterstone Court, a spacious and well-built mansion,
is situated near the site of the old residence of the
Norman family of Walbeoffe, in grounds ornamented
with a stately avenue of elms and a small group of
oak-trees. The Hay railway, from Brecknock to the
rich agricultural districts of Herefordshire, runs
through the northern part of the parish.
The living is a rectory, rated in the king's books
at £6. 1. 8; patron, the Rev. Thomas Powell: the
tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge of £255,
and there is a glebe of forty acres, valued at £40 per
annum. The tithes were charged by a member of
the Walbeoffe family with the payment of nine shillings annually to the priory of Malvern, which, upon
the dissolution of that establishment, was received
by the crown. The church, dedicated to St. Peter,
and supposed to have been originally founded by one
of the Walbeoffes, was, with the exception of the old
tower, rebuilt by a parochial rate in 1802, and is a
neat plain edifice, consisting of a nave and chancel:
the chancel was formerly filled with raised tombs,
which, since the rebuilding of the church, have been
placed on a level with the pavement. The tower is
embattled, and is a fine specimen of the later style
of English architecture, though not elaborately ornamented, and from every point of view forms a highly
interesting object. The churchyard is remarkably
picturesque, and is adorned with some fine yew-trees,
several of which, though of great age, are flourishing
in full vigour. The old parsonage-house appears to
be of very ancient date, probably coeval with the
settlement of the first Norman family, for besides the
Norman arches that constitute the doorways, and the
stone mullions of the windows, several stones have
been found in the walls, ornamented with the Norman
or Saxon scrolls, and on one of them is an inscription
in the Saxon character, of which the word "Meridic"
is legible. In the hamlet of Llêchvaen was a chapel
of ease, which fell down about a century since, and
has not been rebuilt; the central situation of the
parochial church, and its sufficiency of accommodation,
rendering it unnecessary. There is a place of worship in Llêchvaen for Calvinistic Methodists, with a
Sunday school held in it. The Peterstone estate is
charged by Miss Walbeoffe with the yearly payment
of £2. 8., which is regularly distributed among the
poor of the parish; and a bequest of £3 per annum,
by the same lady, is charged on lands in the parish of
Llanvrynach, for apprenticing a child from this place
every second year with a premium of £6.
On a farm called Mannest, in the parish, and upon
the summit of an eminence that overlooks the villages
of Llanhamllêch, Llanvigan, and Llanvrynach, and
commands a very extensive prospect over the fertile
Vale of Usk, are the remains of a cist-vaen, under an
aged yew-tree, and surrounded with stones apparently from a dispersed cairn, under which it had
been concealed for many ages: at what period it
was opened is not known. It consists of three upright stones, two forming the sides, about five feet in
length, and one at the end, about three feet wide: the
whole height does not exceed three feet from the
ground. By some writers this relic has been supposed to be of Druidical origin, and by others to be the
remains of a hermit's cell: by topographers it is
usually designated Tŷ Illtyd, or St. Illtyd's hermitage. The crosses and characters appear to be nothing more than the rude efforts of pilgrims and
visiters to leave some memorial of themselves behind,
by inscribing the initials of their names, and other
devices, on the stones of the monument. The parish
was anciently crossed by the Roman Via Julia
Montana.
LLANHARAN, a parish, in the poor-law union
of Bridgend and Cowbridge, hundred of Cowbridge, county of Glamorgan, South Wales,
6 miles (N. by E.) from Cowbridge; containing 306
inhabitants. This parish is situated under the southern declivity of a ridge of hills; near the South Wales
railway, and on the road from Bridgend to Llantrissent, Merthyr-Tydvil, and Cardiff. It is bounded
on the north by Peterstone-super-Montem, on the
south by Llanilid, on the east by Llantrissent, and
by St. Bride's Minor on the west. The surface is
undulated and hilly, and the high grounds command
good views, comprehending the Bristol Channel, and
the adjacent country intersected by the river Ely;
the soil in many parts is gravelly, in others peaty and
boggy, and most kinds of agricultural produce are
raised. Llanharan House is a handsome modern
mansion, situated under the shelter of a lofty ridge of
hills, with a south-eastern aspect; the grounds are
richly wooded, and present an agreeable irregularity
of surface, embracing much pleasing scenery: from
the upper part of the house are obtained extensive
and interesting prospects. In Llanharan House is a
valuable collection of Welsh manuscripts, formed by
Llewelyn Sion, an eminent bard of Glamorgan,
illustrative of the system of bardism, preserved in the
Gorsedd Morganwg, in which he presided in 1580.
Llanelay is a good residence of a mixed style of
architecture, situated on the bank of the river Ely,
and sheltered on the north by the lofty hill of Garth.
Craig Matthew, a venerable structure, was formerly
the seat of the Matthews, and afterwards of the
Gibbons. The parish abounds with mineral wealth,
and several of the inhabitants are employed in some
collieries, which are chiefly worked for the supply of
the immediate vicinity; limestone is found in great
quantities, and lead and iron ores have been discovered: magnesian limestone in one place lies above
the coal, which rises again beyond it to the south.
The living is a rectory, consolidated with the rectory
of Llanilid: the church, which is dedicated to St.
Julius and St. Aaron, is thirty-four feet long and
fifteen wide, and contains about ninety sittings.
Mrs. Mary Lougher left £60 to the poor of the
parish, but only £15 of the sum are now available;
£100 were bequeathed by the late Mr. Gibbon, of
Newton House, near Cowbridge, and £120 by the
late Dr. Hoare, Principal of Jesus College, Oxford:
the income arising from these bequests, £12. 1., is
annually distributed among the poor.
LLANHARY (LLAN-ARAU), a parish, in
the union of Bridgend and Cowbridge, hundred
of Cowbridge, county of Glamorgan, South
Wales, 4 miles (N. N. E.) from Cowbridge; containing 268 inhabitants. The lands of the parish are
generally inclosed, and in a good state of cultivation; and a portion of its substrata consists of coal of
good quality, which is worked for the supply of the
immediate neighbourhood. The living is a discharged
rectory, rated in the king's books at £5. 12. 8½.;
present net-income, £120; patron, E. Ballard, Esq.
The church is dedicated to St. Arau. There is a
place of worship for Independents; also a dameschool in connexion with the Church, and two Sunday
schools, one of them conducted on Church principles,
and the other belonging to the Independent body.
Mr. Gibbon, of Newton House, near Cowbridge, bequeathed £200, the interest of which is annually
distributed among the poor, shortly after Christmas;
being a portion of a benefaction of £500 left by that
gentleman, the residue of which he directed to be
divided equally among the parishes of Llanharan,
Llantrissent, and Llanblethian.
LLANHOWEL (LLAN-HOWEL), a parish,
in the union of Haverfordwest, hundred of Dewisland, county of Pembroke, South Wales, 4½
miles (E. by N.) from St. David's; containing 160
inhabitants. It is situated in the north-western part
of the county, nearly in the centre of a peninsula
stretching into St. George's Channel, and terminating
in the promontory called St. David's Head. The
living is a discharged vicarage, with that of Llandeloy
annexed; patrons and impropriators, the Dean and
Chapter of the Cathedral of St. David's. The tithes
of Llanhowel have been commuted for £67 payable
to the impropriators, and £42 payable to the vicar:
the vicar's glebe comprises eighty-one acres, valued
at £60 per annum. The church, dedicated to St.
Hoel, presents no details of importance.
LLANIDAN (LLAN-IDAN), a parish, in the
union of Carnarvon, hundred of Menai, county
of Anglesey, North Wales, 7 miles (S. W. by W.)
from Bangor; containing, exclusively of the chapelry
of Llanvair-y-Cwmmwd, 1370 inhabitants. This
parish, which is situated on the western shore of the
Menai strait, was in ancient times one of the principal
stations of the Druids, being included in a large
district, in which the arch-druid, the sub-druid, and
other priests of that order had their abode. From
this circumstance are derived the names of the several
hamlets of the parish, of which Tre'r Dryw was the
seat of the arch-druid; Tre'r Beirdd, that of the bards;
Bôdowyr, the residence of Druidical priests; and
Bôd Drudan, a habitation of the Druids. Suetonius
Paulinus, who entirely destroyed the authority of
these priests in Britain, is said to have landed his
forces at Porthamel, not far from this place, at a spot
still called Pant yr Ysgraf, or "the valley of skiffs,"
from his having transported his infantry across the
Menai in flat-bottomed boats. Being, however,
almost immediately compelled to retreat by the insurrection under Boadicea, the Roman general was
unable to make any permanent settlement here; nor
have any remains undoubtedly Roman, either of this
or a later period, been discovered, with the exception
only of a few coins that have been occasionally dug up
in the neighbourhood. The parish comprises 4001
acres, of which 30 acres are common or waste. The
lands, with some trifling exceptions, are inclosed, and
in a good state of cultivation. Limestone abounds
in the parish, the quarrying and burning of which
afford employment to several of the inhabitants,
great quantities being prepared for manure, and
shipped in the Menai, to be conveyed coastwise to
Liverpool and other places. Llanidan Hall, a seat
of Lord Boston's, commands fine prospects. At Bryn
Siencyn, near the strait, in the parish, fairs are held
on March 11th, April 14th, September 13th, October
12th, and November 12th.
The living is a discharged vicarage, with the perpetual curacies of Llanddaniel-Vab, Llanedwen, and
Llanvair-y-Cwmmwd annexed, rated in the king's
books at £10; present net income, £292: one-third
of the great tithes belongs to the vicar, and the remainder to Lord Boston, who is patron. The church,
dedicated to St. Nidan, was appropriated to the convent of Bethgelart; its revenues shared the fate of
that establishment in 1535, and the advowson was
granted by Queen Elizabeth to Edward Downam and
Peter Ashton. In 1605 those grantees sold the advowson to Richard Prytherch of Myvyrian, whose
daughter conveyed it by marriage to the Llwyds of
Lligwy, on the extinction of which family it was purchased, with the rest of their estates, by Lord Uxbridge, who bequeathed it to the father of the present
Lord Boston. The present church was erected only
a few years ago, at some distance from the former
edifice; it cost upwards of £600, and is apparently
of substantial construction, but is much inferior in
style to the old building. The latter, which has been
for the most part demolished, was an interesting
church, and one of the most important religious
structures in the isle of Anglesey. Its situation, also,
was somewhat peculiar, it being erected in an inclosure almost circular, surrounded by "tall ancestral
trees," and immediately behind the mansion of Lord
Boston, from which it was not twenty yards distant.
The reasons assigned for its desertion were, that it
required so much reparation as to make it more advantageous to raise a new edifice; and next, that the
population having shifted to the spot called Bryn
Siencyn, it was desirable to choose a site for the
new church in that part of the parish. There are
several places of worship for dissenters; a Church
day school, at Bryn Siencyn; and three Sunday
schools, all of them belonging to the dissenters. The
Rev. Henry Rowlands, in 1616, bequeathed to the
poor a rent-charge of 8s. on his estate of Plâs Gwyn,
besides which there are some small rent-charges
amounting to about as much more, and a few charitable donations and bequests; principally a sum of
£1 paid annually by Lord Boston, and a similar
amount from a bequest by an unknown donor to be
divided among twenty old men. Two small charities
have been lost.
Of the Druidical antiquities with which the parish
abounded, and of which so exact an account has been
given by Mr. Rowlands in his "Mona Antiqua
Restaurata," but very few are at present in any tolerable state of preservation, and of many there are
scarcely any vestiges. The spacious grove and
temple of Tre 'r Dryw are now hardly distinguishable; and only a few of the stones that formed the
sacraria are remaining to mark out the site: Bryn
Gwyn, the grand consistory of the Druidical administration, a circular cavity 180 feet in diameter, was
surrounded originally by an immense rampart of
earth and stones, and had near it a circle of stones, one
of which, now forming part of the gable of a dwellinghouse, is above twelve feet in height and of proportionate bulk. Tre 'r Beirdd, "the seat of the bards,"
has been almost entirely demolished, the materials
having been used for building; its site is now occupied by two small tenements. Bôdowyr contains
a cromlech, supported on several upright stones, in a
tolerably perfect state, but the circle has been removed. Trêvrŷ has only three upright stones remaining, at a great distance from each other; the
foundations have been removed, and the site was
levelled by the plough in 1827. Tan Ben y Cevn
remains in an entire state, though concealed from
observation by the brambles with which it is overspread. Two upright stones only are left at Llŷslew;
and of numerous others, noticed by Mr. Rowlands,
not the slightest vestiges can be traced. Caer Lêb,
or "the moated intrenchment," supposed to have
been the residence of the arch-druid, is in good preservation, and forms a quadrangular area, defended
by a double rampart, with a broad intervening ditch,
and surrounded on the outside by a ditch of smaller
dimensions; within the area are foundations of square
and circular buildings. It is now doubted whether
Caer Lêb be not a Roman encampment; and it is
asserted that a paved road, similar to a Roman road
in construction, runs by the north-eastern side of the
work, and across the adjoining common towards the
Menai; the road lies about three feet below the soil,
and has been of late exposed in several places.
Castell Idris, built on the summit of a rock, and defended on the accessible sides by three walls in the
form of a crescent, is a fortress of British origin, but
of later date than the time of the Druids; it is a
place of great strength and in good preservation,
though overgrown with brambles, and concealed by
a young plantation of forest-trees. The Rev. Henry
Rowlands, already mentioned, author of the "Mona
Antiqua Restaurata," published in 1723, was vicar of
the parish at the time he wrote that work.
LLANIDLOES (LLAN-IDLOES), a borough, market-town, and parish, and, jointly with
Newtown, the head of a poor-law union, in the
Upper division of the hundred of Llanidloes,
county of Montgomery, North Wales, 26½ miles
(S. W.) from Welshpool, 22 (W. S. W.) from Montgomery, and 193 (W. N. W.) from London; containing 4261 inhabitants, of whom 2742 are in the borough. This parish, which is of considerable extent,
derives its name from the dedication of its church to
St. Idloes, an eminent British saint, who flourished
about the middle of the sixth century. The town is
situated in a fertile vale, watered by the river Severn,
which has its source within the parish, and almost surrounded by hills of moderate elevation, some of them
crowned with thriving plantations, and others richly
cultivated. The scenery of the vale is beautifully
picturesque, and the banks of the river are enlivened
with some pleasant villas and handsome residences:
the hills that surround the town form a striking contrast to the barren heights seen in the distance,
among which the great mountain of Plinlimmon,
partly within the limits of the parish, forms a conspicuous and interesting feature. Llanidloes occupies a favourable site on the southern bank of the
Severn, and on the turnpike-road from Shrewsbury
through Newtown to Aberystwith. It consists principally of two spacious streets, intersecting each other
nearly at right angles, and has been improved and
enlarged by the erection of several respectable houses.
On the western side, and in a picturesque situation
near the vicarage-house, is a stone bridge of one arch
over the river; and another handsome stone bridge of
three arches has been erected, at an expense of
£3000, over the same river, near the place where it
receives the tributary stream of the Clywedog, which,
after flowing some distance through the parish, falls
into the Severn. The inhabitants are amply supplied
with water.
The approaches to the town are remarkably fine,
especially that from Aberystwith, and the environs
abound with features of rural simplicity and romantic beauty. On the road leading from Aberystwith,
having passed over a bridge about two miles from
Llanidloes, is a genteel house, called Glandulas, the
grounds belonging to which are planted with a variety
of fir, lime, elm, chestnut, beech, and other trees; a
beautiful trout-stream flowing close to the house.
Upon the south side is Maenol, a very handsome
large house, erected in the Elizabethan style, and
forming an ornamental feature in the scenery; and
immediately bordering on the town is Glandwr, a
beautiful residence, having grounds disposed with
great taste, and planted with trees, flowering-shrubs,
and annuals. Dôl Llŷs, in the parish, commands a
delightful view of the Vale of Severn, with the windings of the river and the rich and finely varied
scenery on its banks, terminated by the high mountains in the distance. Mount Severn, an elevated
and truly romantic spot, overlooking the river, which
winds beautifully below the house, commands an interesting view of the picturesque cottage of Nant-y-Brace, embosomed in the trees that crown the opposite bank. There are some pleasing views to the
south-east, and in many parts of the neighbourhood
are fine prospects over the adjacent country, which
is richly diversified. Besides the Severn, the Clywedog and the Dulas water the parish; and about
two miles from the town, on the road to Trêveglwys,
is a spacious pool called Llyn Ebyr, extending over
a surface of about fifty acres, and abounding with
pike, eels, and perch; it is frequented by wild fowl,
and during the summer season is the resort of parties
of pleasure, for whose accommodation several boats,
belonging to gentlemen in the vicinity, are kept upon
the pool.
The manufacture of flannel has been established
from a very early period in this town, which sixty
years ago was the only place in the county where
that material was made, the produce being conveyed
by packhorses to the market of Welshpool for sale.
Since that period, however, it has been outrivalled
by Newtown, which, within the last five and forty
years, has obtained great eminence in the production of flannel of a finer texture, though probably less
durable, than that of Llanidloes. The manufacture
here has, notwithstanding, continued to increase, and
there are at present six carding-mills within the
limits of the parish, and eighteen fulling-mills, and
nearly 35,000 spindles constantly in operation in the
town and neighbourhood, affording employment to
considerably more than 2000 hands. All the spinning
and weaving were formerly carried on in private
houses and cottages, but of late years eight or nine
factories have been erected, in which most of the
same kind of work is now done, and three of which
are very superior buildings. About 300 pieces of
flannel, averaging in length 150 yards each, are
manufactured here, and sent every fortnight to the
market at Newtown, held every alternate Thursday.
There are several malt-houses and kilns in the town
and its vicinity, as well as tanneries and corn-mills.
The market is held on Saturday, and is abundantly
supplied with wool, grain, and provisions of every
kind. The market-house, or town-hall, an ancient
edifice of timber and plaster, is situated in the
centre of the town; but it is little used at present, in consequence of a very spacious hall having
been built, near the Trewythen Arms hotel, in the
second story of which the wool-market is kept, whilst
below are the shambles, butter-market, &c. Fairs
take place annually on the second Saturday in
February, the first Saturday in April, on May 11th,
the Saturday next preceding the 24th of June, on
July 17th, the second Saturday in September, the
first Friday in October, the 28th of that month, and
the Saturday before December 16th. Sheep-fairs are
also held every Thursday from the 26th of May to
the 26th of June inclusive, which are attended by
shepherds of both North and South Wales.
The town received its first charter of incorporation from John de Charlton, lord of Powys, in the
18th year of the reign of Edward III., and obtained
other successive charters, the last of which was granted
by John Tiptoft, lord of Powys, in the 26th year of
Henry VI. Under these charters, which have been
lost, or destroyed by accident, the government was
vested in a mayor, recorder, and an indefinite number
of aldermen and burgesses, assisted by a coroner, two
serjeants-at-mace, and other officers. The mayor was
elected by the burgesses annually at the court leet of
the lord of the manor, in the first week after Michaelmas, and might, if he chose to qualify, act as a magistrate within the borough, but was not ex officio a
justice of the peace: the recorder was appointed by
the lord of the manor, and held his office for life.
By the act 5th and 6th of Wm. IV., c. 76, the corporation is styled the "Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses," and consists of a mayor, four aldermen,
and twelve councillors, together forming the council
of the borough, of which the municipal and parliamentary boundaries are identical. The council elect
the mayor annually on Novembervember
1st, one-third going out of office every year. Aldermen and councillors must have each a property qualification of £500, or be rated at £15 annual value.clerk, treasurer, and other officers on Nov. 9th.
The elective franchise was granted in the 27th of
Henry VIII., when Llanidloes was constituted a
contributory borough to Montgomery; and it exercised that privilege till the year 1728, when, together with Llanvyllin and Welshpool, it was disfranchised by a vote of the House of Commons,
which restricted the right of election to the burgesses of Montgomery alone. This resolution being
directly at variance with a previous one in 1680,
by which the right had been confirmed, the burgesses, by the statute of the 28th of George III.,
were granted the power of asserting their claim to
vote for a member for Montgomery before any
future committee of the House, and of making any
appeal, within twelve calendar months, against any
subsequent decision. The act for "Amending the
Representation of the People," in 1832, restored the
franchise to the borough, in common with others in
the county which had been deprived of it; and it
is now one of the five that contribute with Montgomery in the return of a representative to parliament. The right of voting is vested in every male
person of full age occupying, either as owner, or
as tenant under the same landlord, a house or other
premises in the borough of the annual value of not
less than £10, provided he be capable of registering
as the act directs: the present number of tenements
of this value within the limits of the borough, which
were somewhat confined by the Boundary Act, and
are minutely detailed in the Appendix to this work,
is 113. Llanidloes is also a polling-place in the
election of a parliamentary representative for the
shire. The county magistrates and county coroner
exercise jurisdiction within the town, and the former
hold a petty-session for the hundred on the first Monday in every month. The powers of the county debtcourt of Llanidloes, established in 1847, extend over
the parishes of Llanidloes, Llangurig, and Trêveglwys. A court baron for the manor of Arustley,
the jurisdiction of which extends over the hundred,
takes place every third Monday, for the recovery of
debts and determining of actions under the amount of
£2, by process similar to that of the supreme courts
at Westminster.
The parish is bounded on the north by that of
Trêveglwys; on the south by the parishes of Llangurig and St. Harmon, the latter of which is in Radnorshire; on the east by that of Llandinam; and on
the west by Llanbadarn-Vawr, in the county of Cardigan. It comprises by admeasurement 17,278 acres,
of which 4078 are sheep-walks, and the remainder
inclosed land, consisting of arable and pasture. The
surface being hilly, and in some parts mountainous,
the soil is various, though generally fertile, producing
wheat, oats, and barley; the lower grounds, which
are tolerably well wooded with oak, fir, and other
trees, are in a good state of cultivation, and the declivities of the hills afford pasturage to numerous flocks
of sheep. In 1816 an act of parliament called the
"Arustley Inclosure Act" was obtained for improving the common and waste in the vicinity, under
the provisions of which considerable portions of land
in this parish have been inclosed, and are now under
cultivation. Lead-ore has been found, and some
mines were formerly worked, but not with sufficient
advantage to remunerate the adventurers, and they
were consequently discontinued: the hills abound with
coarse slate, and in the vicinity are some quarries of
stone of good quality for building.
The living is a discharged vicarage, rated in the
king's books at £4. 3. 4.; present net income, £151,
with a glebe-house; patron, the Bishop of Bangor;
impropriators, the Dean and Chapter of Bangor, Sir
W. W. Wynn, Bart., and the Vicar of Llangurig.
The church, dedicated to St. Idloes, was originally
founded towards the close of the fifth, or at the beginning of the sixth century. The present structure
consists of a nave and aisle, with a tower more ancient
than either. The aisle was built about 200 years
since, and is separated from the nave by brought hither from the abbey of Cwm
Hîr, in the county of Radnor, and the date upon
one of the shields (1542) corresponds with the time
of the dissolution of that establishment. amounting to £1600: a new set of bells was hung in the
tower, in 1825, at a cost of £200. The area is very
spacious, and there is a small gallery; the sittings
will accommodate 550 or 600 persons. There are
places of worship for Baptists, Independents, and
Calvinistic and Wesleyan Methodists; a National
day and Sunday school, for boys and girls; and fourteen Sunday schools for children and adults, supported by the dissenters. The Rev. Dr. David
Lloyd bequeathed a rent-charge of £2. 12., to be
apportioned out in bread on Sundays to the poor.
Catherine Lloyd left £100, with which, and its accumulated interest, two properties, called Tŷ'n-y-Vron,
and Crowlwm, were purchased; the one containing
twenty-nine acres and a quarter, to which an inclosure allotment of twenty-one acres was subsequently
added, and the other ten and a half acres, afterwards
increased by an allotment of eleven acres and threequarters; the whole now producing a rent of £33. 15.,
which is appropriated towards the support of the
National school. A rent-charge of £14 by the Rev.
Dr. Jenkin Bowen, of Welford, Gloucestershire, and
another of £2. 10. by Evan Glynne, of Glynne, are
distributed among the poor.
Within the limits of the parish is partly included
the lofty mountain of Plinlimmon, or, more properly, Pumlum, that on the higher peak being pyramidal, commercial
importance, while the Wye and the Rheidiol surpass
all other rivers in Britain for the Llanidloes.
The Wye rises from two powerful springs on the
south-eastern side of the mountain, and, after a long
circuitous course, falls into the Severn below Chepstow. The Rheidiol has its source in the pool of
Llygad Rheidiol, and falls into the Irish Sea at Aberystwith; the Llyvnant issues from a pool called Glâs
Lyn. The height of the mountain is 2463 feet. At
Melin Velindre, on the route to Plinlimmon, is a
romantic cataract; and near the sheep-farm of Blaen
Havren the Severn rolls its waters over a lofty ledge
of slate rocks, in which they have formed gullies of
various picturesque shapes.
LLANIESTYN (LLAN-IESTYN), a parish,
in the union of Bangor and Beaumaris, partly in
the hundred of Tyndaethwy, and partly within the
liberties of the borough of Beaumaris, county of
Anglesey, North Wales, 3½ miles (N. W. by N.)
from Beaumaris; containing 275 inhabitants, of whom
129 are in the former, and 146 in the latter, portion.
This parish, which derives its name from the dedication of its church to St. Iestyn or Iestin, son of
Geraint, is situated nearly in the centre of the promontory separating Beaumaris Roads from the Irish
Sea, and comprises a small tract of land, the greater
part of which is inclosed and cultivated. The perpetual curacy, annexed to that
of Llangoed. The church was granted in 1243, by
Prince Llewelyn, to the priory that he had recently
founded at Llanvaes, to which establishment it belonged at the Dissolution. The present building is
for the most part of the fifteenth century; it is one of
the plainest churches in the island of Anglesey, and
consists only of a nave, or single aisle, but contains
two highly interesting relics, namely, a sculptured
slab commemorating the saint after whom the church
is named, and a remarkably curious font probably of
the twelfth century. The slab, which is now, for
better preservation, placed vertically in the wall, is
of the fourteenth century, being some centuries after
the time of the saint; and is surpassed in antiquarian
value by few monumental effigies in Wales. It is of
curious workmanship, and bears. The inscription on the slab, in old
characters, has been variously read by different antiquaries, but the following is the tenour, as correctly
given by the Hon. Daines Barrington, and adopted
by Mr. Pennant: "Hic jacet Sanctus Yestinus, cui
Gwenllian, Filia Madoc et Gryffyt ap Gwilym, optulit in oblacoem istam imaginem p. salute animarum s."
The monument is noticed by Rowlands, in his "Mona
Antiqua Restaurata," and an account of it was read
before the Society of Antiquaries, in 1776, and published in the fifth volume of the Archæologia: an
accurate engraving of it, also, with two views of the
font, is comprised in the Archæologia Cambrensis for
October 1847. The income arising from a few
small charitable donations and bequests amounting
to £24, which have been vested in the purchase of
land, and produce a rental of £2. 2., is annually distributed among the poor; and the parish has erected
three cottages upon another portion of the land so
bought, which, with one before existing on it, are
given to poor families to live in rent-free.
LLANIESTYN (LLAN-IESTYN), a parish,
in the union of Pwllheli, principally in the hundred of Dinllaen, and partly in that of Gaflogion,
in the Lleyn division of the county of Carnarvon,
North Wales, 8 miles (W. by S.) from Pwllheli;
containing 1090 inhabitants. This parish, which
derives its name from the dedication of its church, is
pleasantly situated at the head of a small valley
opening towards the south, near the south-western
extremity of the county, almost in the centre of the
great headland that separates the bay of Carnarvon
from that of Cardigan. It is bounded on the southeast by the parishes of Llangian and Bottwnog,
and on the north-west by those of Tydweiliog and
Penllêch; and comprises about 4500 acres, nearly
equally divided between arable and pasture land.
The scenery, though bare of wood, is interesting and
picturesque, being greatly diversified with hill and
dale; and the soil, some of which is light earth and
other parts heavy clay, produces chiefly barley and
oats. In the mountainous part of the parish are
some appearances of lead-ore and nikel, but the veins
are not of sufficient extent to promise remuneration
to the adventurer, and no works have been opened.
The village is seated at the base of Carn Madryn, a
lofty, barren, isolated hill, which was formerly one of
the strongholds of Roderic and Maelgwyn, sons of
Owain Gwynedd, to whom this part of the principality
belonged. The summit of the hill was once surrounded by a wall, still traceable in its whole circuit,
and remaining in some parts to the height of several
feet; within the area are foundations of circular
buildings, and near the base of the mountain are the
remains of numerous circular and quadrilateral buildings, the walls of which are in many instances tolerably perfect. The upper part of the mountain is
supposed to have been occupied by the chieftains
during their sojourn in this stronghold, and the base
by their vassals and subsidiary forces, who, during
times of invasion, came hither with their cattle for
security.
The living is a rectory, with the perpetual curacies
of Bôdverin, Llandegwining, and Penllêch annexed,
rated in the king's books at £21. 3. 9.; present net
income, £595, with a glebe-house; patron, the Bishop
of Bangor. The tithes of the parish have been commuted for a rent-charge of £371, with a glebe of 23a.
2r. 31p., valued at £30 per annum. The church,
dedicated to St. Iestyn, is a spacious and handsome
structure, partly in the later Norman, and partly in
the early English style of architecture, consisting of
a nave, south aisle, and chancel, the whole seventyeight feet long and forty-two broad, and containing
about 500 sittings. The aisle is separated from the
nave by a range of pentagonal pillars and circular
arches, and is lighted by a series of elegant lancetshaped windows: some fragments still remain of the
exquisitely carved oak screen that divided the chancel
from the nave. The pulpit and the reading-desk are
attached, the former to the northern, and the latter
to the southern, wall. There are two places of worship for Calvinistic Methodists, and one for Independents; a day school; and four Sunday schools,
three of which belong to the dissenters. The rental
of a tenement bequeathed by Roger Jones, in 1621,
and now producing £13 per annum, is distributed
among the poor at Christmas: there is also a sum of
12s. 6d., a portion of £5 interest, payable on a turnpike-bond of the trustees of the Conway road; and
about a similar sum from an ancient rent-charge, disposed of in like manner.

Present: The King's most Excellent Majesty.
New-England.
'His Majesty and the Board taking into consideration the frequent resort to New-England, of divers Person ill-affected to the Religion established in the Church of England, and to the good and peaceable Government of this State. However, upon the humble Petition of the Merchants, Passengers, and Owners of Ships now bound for New-England, and upon the Reasons by them representedto the Board, His Majesty was graciously pleased at this time to free them from a late Restraint, and to set them at liberty to proceed on in their intended Voyage. Nevertheless His Majesty well knowing the factious disposition of the People (for a great part of them) in that Plantation, and how unfit and unworthy they are of any Support or Countenance from hence, in respect of the great Disorders and want of Government amongst them; where of sundry and great Complaints have been presented to the Board, and made appear to be true, by those that being well-affected, both for Religion and Government, have suffered much loss in their Estates by the unruly Factious Party, did think fit and Order, That Mr. Attorney General shall forthwith draw up a Proclamation, expressing his Majesty's Royal Pleasure to prohibit all Merchants, Masters, and Owners of Ships from henceforth to set forth any Ship, or Ships, with Passengers for New-England, till they first obtained special Licence on that behalf, from such of the Lords of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy-Council, as are appointed for the Business of Foreign Plantations by special Commission.

Ministers and Tythes in adjacent Parishes to London
'Whereas an humble Petition was this day read at the Board unto the King's most excellent Majesty in the Names of the Parsons, Vicars, and Curats of the adjacent Places to the City of London, namely, of St. Margarets Westminster, St. Clements Danes, St. Giles in the Fields, St. James Clarkenwel, St. Leonard Shoreditch, St. Martins in the Fields, St. Mary Newington, in Southwark, St. Magdalen Bermondsey, St. Saviours Southwark, St. Kath. Tower, Lambeth, and St. Olaves in Southwark; Shewing unto His Majesty the great increase of New-Buildings of late Years, erected in the Petitioners
'several Parishes; and that the number of People is now so much augmented, that the said Livings are for the present incompetent and in no proportion meet for the discharge of so great Cures, some of the Petitioners receiving no Tithe at all, the rest far short of that which of right ought to be paid unto them; that great numbers of Parishioners in the aforesaid Parishes, now living in Houses, lately built upon that Ground which heretofore hath paid Tithes and other Rights (to the said several Churches) pay now to the Petitoners, either nothing, or but 2 d. at Easter, and 3 d. at the most, besides the Obventions of small value; and therefore humbly besought his Majesty, amidst His Gracious Thoughts towards the Clergy of London, to take the Case of the Parishioners into His Princely Care, and to take some course for the better maintenance of the Petitioners, and for the establishing of their Right. And whereas by former Order hath the said Parsons, Vicars, and Curats, and also the Church-Wardens, and divers of the principal Parishioners of the said Parishes appeared this day before His Majesty and their Lordships, in whose hearing and presence, the said Petition being again read, they the said Clergy, and Church-Wardens, and Parishioners, alleadged themselves to be no way authorized thereunto. It was thereupon by His Majesty ordered, That the said Clergy should forthwith prepare their Submissions respectively. And that the Church-Wardens and Vestry-Men of the aforesaid several Parishes, should with like diligence and expedition assemble their Parishioners; and communicating the Petition of the said Clergy unto them, withall acquaint them with His Majesty's Pleasure touching their Submission; and they the Parishioners by Writing, signed with their hands, fully to authorize their several Vestry-Men, or Church-Wardens, to return unto His Majesty their Answer therein. And that both the said Clergy, as also the Vestry-Men, or Church-Wardens of each Parish so authorized, fail not to give their attendance, with their said Submissions and Authorizations, upon Sunday the 6th of May next. Whereof all Parties are required hereby to take notice, and to govern themselves accordingly.
May the 4th.

'This day upon consideration, as well of the Petition of the Parishioners of St. Gregories, as of certain Articles propounded by the Parishioners of St. Gregory's aforesaid, to the Parishioners of Christs-Church, and of others propounded by the Parishioners of Christs-Church to those of St. Gregory's, concerning the accommodating the Parishioners of St.Gregory's in the West end of Christ-Church, for the exercising of Divine Service there. It was by the Board ordered,
'That the Parishioners of St.Gregory's shall place no Pews in Christ-Church, but such as shall be moveable, to the end that Burials may not be hindered, when those of Christ-Church have occasion to bury there.
'That for the said Parishioners of St. Gregory's coming in and going, they shall make use of the West Doors only.
'That they shall depart and leave the said West end of the Church at the Feast of St.John Baptist, which shall be in the Year of Our Lord God 1641.

'And lastly; Their Lordships do hereby order and require, That the Church-Wardens, Common-Council-Men, and Sidemen, as well of the Parish of St.Gregory's, as of that of Christ-Church shall subscribe to the performance of all the aforesaid Articles; and that such their Subscription, together with this their Lordships Order, shall oblige respectively both the one and the other side to the due performance of the same, and every part thereof. And upon this Subscription, which is forthwith required, those of Christ-Church, shall presently deliver the Keys of that part of the Church to those of St. Gregory's. Hereof as well the Parishioners of Christ-Church, as those of St.Gregory's, are to take notice, and conform themselves accordingly.
At the Court at Whitehall, May 6.
A further Order concerning Tithes as to the Out-Parishes.
'This day Information was given to His Majesty and the Board, That where His Majesty's Order of the of April last, touching the Submission of fixteen of the Out-Parishes in the Suburbs of London, and the Liberties of Westminster, unto His Majesty and the Board, concerning the Increase of Maintenance to their Ministers, in such manner as other Parishes within the City of London had done,
'was published within the Parish Church of St. Giles in the Fields, upon Ascension day last past; That one George Winder, qualifying himself a Messenger Extraordinary of His Majesty's Chamber, did, in the midst of a great Assembly of the Parishioners, who then seemed inclinable to return unto His Majesty a modest and respective Answer to His Pleasure signified unto them, did in a most uncivil and insolent manner affront Mr. Dr. Heywood, one of His Majesty's Chaplains in Ordinary, Parson of the said Parish, and Lawrence Whitaker Esq; one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace, an Inhabitant in the said Parish, when they delivered the Points of the said Order to the Assembly, and perswaded them to submission therein required, whereby, and by his peremptory carriage, and affirming of untruths, the Votes of the said Parishioners were diverted from giving such satisfaction to His Majesty's Propostions as were expected. It was therefore ordered by His Majesty and the Board, That the Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold should be prayed and required to call the said George Winder before him, and examine him touching the said Offence; and if he found it to be as was informed, that he should then take such order for his Punishment, either by taking from him the countenace of his pretened Service, or otherwise, as his Lordship shall find his Offence to deserve.
August 19.
Unconformable Ministers.
'Whereas it is observed, That such Ministers who are unconformable to the Discipline and Ceremonies of the Church here, have and do frequently transport themselves to the Summer-Islands, and other his Majesty's Plantations abroad, where they take liberty to nourish and preserve their Factious and Schismatical Humours, to the seducing and abuse of his Majesty's Subjects, and the hindrance of that good Conformity and Unity in the Church, which His Majesty is careful and desirous to establish throughout his Dominions. We are therefore in His Majesty's Name, and by His express Command, hereby to pray and require your (fn. 1) Lordship to take a present and strict Order, That no Clergy-Men be from hence-forth suffered to go over into the Summer-Islands, but such only as shall have approbation in that behalf, from Our very good Lords, the Lord Arch-Bishop of Canterbury his Grace, and the Lord Bishop of London. And that for all such of them as are already gone thither, without such Approbation, that you cause them forthwith to be remanded back hither. And so expecting a good account hereof from your Lordship, we bid you very heartily farewel.

The Qu. Mother of France comes to England.
October the last, Mary de Medicis, the Queen Mother of France, came to London, and so to St.James's. The People were generally Malecontent at her coming, and wish'd her farther off; for they did not like her Train and Followers, which had often been observed to bring the Sword or Pestilence, so that she was beheld as some Meteor of ill signification. Nor was one of these Calamities thought more the effect of her Fortune than Inclination, for her restless and uncessant Spirit was prone to embroil all wheresoever the came. Her impetuous banding and combining with Monsieur the Duke of Orleans, and the improperity of that enterprise, made France too hot for her, and drave her, in the Year 1631, to Brussels, where the Cardinal D'Infanta treated her a while with most honourable Caresses and Respects; but Flanders, which at first seemed her Place of Refuge, became afterwards her greatest Danger, she being (as her own Manifesto sets forth) so hunted and pursued with continual Imprecations and Curses there, as she began to fear some violence to her Person; so that quitting that Country, she betook her self to the Protection of the Prince of Orange 1637. Long she stayed not there, but having received an invitation from the Queen her Daughter, resorted hither.

To find Horse and Arms.
'This day, his Majesty being present in Council, was pleased in his Provident and Princely Care for the Safety and Defence of the Realm, to take into Consideration amongest other Particulars, the making compleat, and increasing all that conveniently may be, the number of Horse in every County, as a most important part of the Strength of the Kingdom. And for the better advancing and purting in execution thereof, it was taken into deliberation what proportion of Lands and Estate within the County ought to be chargeable with the finding of Horse; and upon mature advice thought fit and resolved, That every person having Lands of Inheritance of the clear yearly value of two hundred or three hundred pounds per Ann. within the County, or other Estate equivalent thereunto, should be chargeable with a Horse, viz. two hundred pounds per Annum with a Light Horse, and three hundred pounds per Annum with a Lance, at the discretion of the Lord-Lieutenant of that County for the time being. And whereas it was now like wise taken into consideration that the sparing of some Persons doth open a gap to excuses and backwardness in others; to the weakning both of Horse and Foot. And for that by Letters under his Majesty's Roial Signature, bearing date 24th day of May, And by a Minute of Letters from the Board, sent together with his Majesty's said Letters to the Lords Lieutenants of every County, it appeared that his Majesty's pleasure was then declared and signified to be, That no Man's Purse should be spared in these Services, upon any Excuse or Pretence what soever; And that his own Servants, and those that attend him in Court, should be priviledged only, and spared from personal and actual Duties, but their Lands and Revenues to be as liable as any others to the Charge of finding Arms in those Counties where the same to lie. It was therefore (according to his Majesty's express will and pleasure now again Declared) Resolved and Ordered, That the Direction and Command given on that behalf, by his Majesty's former Letters, should be pursued and put in Execution by the Lords Lieutenants of every County. And that the like Rule should be held and observed as well concerning the Persons as the Lands and Revenues, of all and every the Ministers and Officers of any his Majesty's Courts of Justice, or any others that pretend Privilege by reason of any relation to his Majesty's Service, or dependance upon any great Officer in respect of his Place and Office, which however it was not so particularly expressed in his Majesty's former Letters, yet (as his Majesty was now pleased to observe and declare) the same was
necessarily implied; for that if none of his own Servants were to be priviledged and exempted in their Lands and Estates from being chargeable with Arms, much less was it intendedthat the Ministers and Officers of any of his Courts of Justice, or any other pretending Privilege by his Majesty's Service, or by dependence upon any great Officers in respect of their Offices, should in a like case have any great Priviledge or exemption allowed them. Hereof a Copy is to be forthwith sent to the Lord Lieutenant of every County.

Affairs in Scotland.
Now we beg leave for a while to make a step into Scotland, to give an Account of the Transactions of Affairs in that Kingdom since the Month of December in the preceding Year 1637. The Scots begin their Year always with the Month of January, according to Foreign stile; so the first thing that offers it self in order of Times is, That his Majesty sent the Earl of Roxborough, Lord Privy-Seal (then at the Court in England ) to Scotland, with certain Instructions to the Council, who were to meet at Dalkeith, to consider of the Disordered Affairs of that Kingdom. And the Council removed the Session [or Term] from Linlithgow to Sterling, twenty four miles from Edinburgh, to the end the Multitudes might be dispersed, under pain of Treason; but nevertheless they came in great Tumults to Sterling also, and the Earl of Traquaire, Lord Treasurer of that Kingdom, being newly returned back from the King, went with the rest of the Council to Sterling, where they caused a Proclamation to be made for the dispersing of the huge and dangerous Tumults there assembled, and to assure the King's Subjects of his Majesty's sincerity towards the Religion Established in that Kingdom, and caused the Proclamation to that purpose (following) to be made publick accordingly.
Charles by the Grace of God, King of Great-Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. To Our Lovits, &c. Our Sheriffs in that Part conjunctly and severally, specially constituted, greeting.
A Proclamation to beat down Superstition. The King hath ordained a Common-Prayer Book.
Forasmuch as We, out of Our Princely Care of maintenance of the true Religion already professed, and for beating down of all superstition, having ordained a Book of Common-Prayer to be compiled for the general Use and edification of our Subjects, withing our Ancient kingdom of Scotland: The same was accordingly done. In the framing whereof We took great care and pains, so as nothing past therein but what was seen and approved by Us, before the same was either divulged or printed; assuring all Our loving Subjects, That not only Our intention is, but even the very Book will be a ready means to maintain the True Religion already professed, and beat out all superstition, of which We in Our own time do not doubt in a fair course to satisfy our good Subjects: But having seen and considered some Petitions and Declarations given in to Our Council against the said Book, and late Canons of the Church, We find Our Royal Authority much injured thereby, both in the Matter and in the Carriage thereof; whereby We conceive these of Our Nobility, Gentry, Burroughs, Ministers, and others, who kept and assisted these Meetings and Convocations, for contriving and forming the said Petitions, or who have subscribed the same, to deserve and be liable to Our high Censure, both in their Persons and fortunes, as having convened themselves, without either Our Consent or Authority; yet because We believe, That what they have done herein, is out of a preposterous zeal, and not out of any Disloyalty or disaffection to Soveraignty, We are graciously pleased, so far forth as concerns these Meetings, for consulting or subscribing of these Petitions, or presenting the same to any judge or Judges in OuO said kingdom, to dispense therewith, and with what may be their fault or Error therein, to all such as upon Signification or Declaration of Our Pleasure, shall retire themselves as becometh good and dutiful Subjects: To which purpose Our Will and Pleasure is, and We charge you straightly, and command, That these Letters seen, incontinent you pass, and in Our name and Authority, make intimation hereof to all Our Lieges and Subjects, by open Proclamation, at all places needful, wherethrough none pretend ignorance thereof; and therewith also that you in Our Name and Authority, discharge all such Convocations and Meetings in time coming, under the pain of Treason. And also that you command, charge, and inhibit all Our Lieges and Subjects, That none of them presume, nor take in hand, to resort nor repair to Our Burgh of Sterling, nor to no other Burgh where Our Council and Session fits, till first they declare their Cause of coming to Our Council, and procure their Warrant to that effect. And further, That you charge and command all sunory Probosts, Bailiffs, and Magistrates, within every Burgh, That they and every one of them, have special care and regard to see this Our Royal Will and Pleasure really
and dutifully obeyed in all Points, and that no violation thereof be suffered within their Bounds, under all highest Pain, Crime, and Offence, that they may commit against us in that behalf. As also that you command and charge all and sundry Noblemen, Barons, Ministers, and Burroughs, who are not actually Indwellers within this Our Burgh, and are not of the Number of the Lords of Our Pridy Council and Session, and Members thereof, and are already within this Our Burgh, that they and every one of them, remove themselves, and depart and pass forth out of Our said Burgh, and return not again without the Warrant aforesaid, within six hours atter the publication hereof, under the said pain of Treason. And as concerning any Petitions that shall hereafter be given Us, upon this or any other Subject, We are likewise pleased to declare, We will not shut Our Ears therefrom, so that neither the form nor matter be prejudicial to Our Regal Authority; the which to do, We commit to you, conjunctly and leberally, Our full Power by these Our Letters, delivering the same by you duly execute and indorsed again to the Bearer. Given under Our Signet at Sterling, the 19th day of February, and of Our Reign the 13th year, 1638.
Per Actum Secreti Concilii.
Upon the publishing of this Proclamation, it met with this Protestation.
For God and the King
February 19.
We Noblemen, Barons, Ministers, Burgers, appointed to attend his Majesty's Answer to our humble Petition and Complaint, and to prefer new Grievances, and to do what else may lawfully conduce to our humble Desires; That whereupon the 23rd of September last, we presented a Supplication to Your Lordships, and another upon the 18th of October last; and also a new Bill relative to the former upon the 19th of December last, and did therein humbly remonstrate our just Exceptions against the Service-Book, and Book of Canons; and also against the Arch-Bishops and Bishops of this Kingdom, as the Contrivers, Maintainers, and Vrgers thereof, and against thier sitting as our Judges, until the Cause be decided; earnestly supplicating withal, to be freed and delivered from the these and all other Innovations of that kind, introduced against the laudable laws of this Kingdom, as that of the High Commission, and other Evils particularly mentioned, and generally contained in our foresaid Supplications and Complaints; and that this our Party Delinquent against our Religion and Laws, may be taken order with, and those pressing Grievances may be taken order with, and redressed according to the Laws of this Kingdom, as by our said Supplications and Complaints doth more largely appear; With the which, on the 19th of December last, we gave in a Declinator against the Arch-Bishops and Bishops as our Parties, who by consequence could not be our Judges: whereupon your Lordships did declare, by Your Act at Dalketih, the said 19th of December, That You would present our Petitions to His Majesty's Royal Consideration, and that without prejudice of the Declinator given in by us the said Supplicants, whereupon we should be heard at time and place convenient, and in the mean time should receive no prejudice, as the said Act in itself beareth. And
whereas we your Lordships Supplicants, with a great deal of patience, and hope also grounded on sundry promises, were expecting an Answer to these our humble Desires, and having learned that upon some Directions of his Majesty anent our Supplicatios and Complaints unto your Lordships of the secret Council, your Lordships admits to the consulting and judging anent our Supplications, and his Majesty's Answer thereunto; the Arch-Bishops and Bishops our direct Parties, contrary to our first Declinator propounded at Dalkeith, and now renewed at Sterling; and contrary to your Lordships Act aforesaid at Dalkeith, and contrary to our Religion, and Laws, and humble Supplications; therefore left our silence be prejudicial to this so important a Cause, as concerns God's Glory and Worship, our Religion, Salvation, the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, or derogatory to the former Supplications and Complaints, or unanswerable to the trust of our Commission; out of our bounden duty to our God, our King and native Country, we are forced to take Instruments in Notaries Hands, of your Lordships refusal to admit our Declinator, or remove these our Parties, and to protest in manner following.
First, That we may have our immediate recourse to our Sacred Soveraign, to present our Grievances, and in a legal way to prosecute the same before the ordinary competent Judges, Civil or Ecclesiastical, without any Offence offered by us, or taken by your Lordships.
Secondly, We protest that the Arch-Bishops and Bishops, our Parties complained upon, cannot be reputed or esteemed Lawful Judges, to sit in any Judicatory in this Kingdom, Civil or Ecclesiastical, upon any of the Supplicants, until after lawful Trial judicially, they purge themselves of such Crimes as we have already laid to their charge, offering to prove the same whensoever his Sacred Majesty shall please to give us audience.
Thirdly, We protest no Act nor Proclamation to follow thereupon, past, or to be past in Council or out of Council, in presence of the Arch-Bishops and Bishops, whom we have already declined to be our Judges, shall be any ways prejudicial to us the Supplicants, our Persons, Estates, lawful Meetings, Proceedings or Pursuits.
Fourthly, We protest that neither we, nor any whose Heart the Lord shall move to join with us in these our Supplications, against the aforesaid Innovations, shall incur any danger in Life, Lands, or any Political or Ecclesiastical Pains, for not observing such Acts, Books, Canons, Rites, Judicatures, Proclamations introduced without or against the Acts of General Assemblies, or Acts of Parliament, the Statutes of this Kingdom, but that it shall be lawful to us or them to use our selves in Matters of Religion, of the External Worship of God and Polity of the Church, according to the Word of God, and laudable Constitutions of this Church and Kingdom, conform to his Majesty's Declaration the 9th of December last.
Fifthly, Seeing by the legal and submissive way of our former Supplications, all those who take these Innovations to heart, have bin kept calm, and carried themselves in a quiet manner in hopes of redress; We protest that if any Inconvenience shall fall out, which we pray the Lord to prevent, upon the pressing of any the foresaid Innovations or Evils, specially or generally contained in our former Supplications and Complaints, and upon your Lordships refusal, to take order there anent, the same be not imputed unto us, who most humbly seek all things to be reformed by an Order.
Sixthly, We protest that these our Requests, proceeding from Conscience,
and adue respect to his Majesty's Honour, do tend to no other end, but to the preservation of the true Resormed Religion, the Laws and Liberties of his Majesty's most ancient Kingdom, and satisfaction of our most humble Desires contained in our Supplication and Complaint, according to his Majesty's accustomed Goodness and Justice; from which we do certainly expect that his Sacred Majesty will provide and grant such Remedy to our just Petitions and Complaints, as may be expected from so gracious a King towards his most Loyal and Dutiful Subjects, calling for redress of so pressing Grievances, and praying to God that his Majesty may long and prosperously reign over us.
After this their Protestation, they did erect a great number of Tables (as they called them); in Edinburgh four Principals, one of the Nobility, another of the Gentry, a third of the Burroughs, and a fourth of the Ministers. And the Gentry had many subordinate Tables, according to their several Shires. These several Tables did consult of what they thought sit to be propounded at the General Table, which consisted of several Commissioners chosen from the other four Tables. And from this time they proceeded in framing and subscribing of their Covenant; concerning which, faith Dr. Belcanqual, the reputed Penman of the King's Declaration, That the first Dung that which from these Stables was thrown upon the Face of Authority and Government, was that lewd Covenant and seditious Band annexed unto it; which followeth in these words.
The Consession forts of Person, in the year 1590, by a new Ordinance of Council, at the desire of the General Assembly; with a General Band for maintenance of the True Religion, and the Kings Person, and now subscribed in the Year 1638, by us Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Bugesses, Ministers, and Commons under subscribing; to gether with our Resolution and Promises for the Causes after specified, to maintain the said True Religion, and the Kings Majesty, according to the Consession aforesaid, and Acts of Parliament; the Tenure whereof here followeth.
We all, and every one of Us under written, do protest, That after long and due examination of our own Consciences in Matters of True and False Religion, are now throughly resolved of the Truth, by the Word and Spirit of God; and therefore We believe with Our Hands, and constantly affirm before God and the whole World, That this only is the true Christian Faith and Religion, pleasing God, and bringing Salvation to Man, which now is by the Mercy of God revealed to the World by the preaching of the bleassed Evangel. And received, believed, and defended by many and sundry notable Kirks and Relams, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, the King's Majesty, and three Estates of this Realm, as God's Eternal Truth, and only Ground of Our Salvation; as more particularly
is expressed in the Consession of Our Faith, established and publickly confirmed by sundry Acts of Parliament; and now of a long time hath bin openly prosessed by the King's Majesty, and whole Body of this Realm, both in Burgh and Land. To the which Consession, consuted by the Word of God, and Kirk of Scotland. But in special, We detest and refuse Rights, proph Langauage; with his Processions and blasphemous Letany, and multitude of Advocates or Mediators; his manifold Orders, Auricular Consession; his desperate and uncertain Repentance; his general and doubtsome Faith; his Satisfactions of Men for their Sins; his Justification by Works, Opus Operatum, Works of Supererrogation, Merits, Pardons, Peregrinations and Stations: His Holy Water, baptizing of Bells, conjuring of Spirits, Crossing, Saning, Anointing, Conjuring, Hallowing of God's good Creatures, with the Superstitious Opinion joined therewith. His wordly Monarchy, and wicked Hierarchy; his three solemn Vows, with all his shavelings of sundry forts; his erroneous and bloody Decrees made at Trent, with all the Subscribers & Our selves willingly in Doctrine, Religion, Faith, Discipline, and Use Out won Consciences, minding thereby, first under the External Claok of Religion, to corrupt and subvert secretly God's True Religion within the Kirk; and afterwards, when time may serve, to become open Enemies and Persecuters Justicie among us, we protest and promise with Our Hearts under the same Oath hand Writ, and pains, that We shall defend his Person and Authority, with out Goods, Bodies, and Lives, in the defence of Christ his Evangel, Libertis of Our Country, Ministration of Justice, and Punishment of Iniquity, against all Enemies within this Realm, or without, as We desire Outarty and Superstition: Or of the Papistical Kirk, as Act. 3.

James 6. & 4 Act of King Charles, That all Kings and Princes at their Coronation and Reception of their Trincely Authority, shall make their faithful Promise by their Solemn Oath in the Presence of the Eternal God, That during the whole time of their Lives they shall serve the same Eternal God to the utmost of their Power, according as he hath required in his most holy Wordy contained in the Old and New Testaments, and according to the same Word shall maintain the true Religion of Christ Jesus, the Preachingof his holy Word, the due and right Ministration of the Sacraments now received and preached within this Realm (according to the Confession of Faith immediately preceding;) and shall abolish and gain said publick Catechisms, and which had bin for many Years with ablessing from Heaven Preached and Professed in this Kirk and Kingdom, as God's undoubted Truth, grounded only upon his written Word: The other Cause was for maintaining the King's Majesty, his Person and Estate; The true Worship of God and the King's Authority being fo straight, Burgesles, Ministers, and Commons under subseribing, Protections, Do hereby profess, and before God, his Angels, and the World solemnly declare, that with our whole Hearts we agree and resolve all the days of our life constantly to adhere unto, and to defend the foresaid true Religion, and forbearing the practice of all Novations,
already introduced in the matters of the Worship of God, or apporbation of teh Corruptions of the publick Government of the Kirk, or civil Places and Power of Kirnmen, till they be tried and allowed in free Assemblies, and in Paliaments, to labour by all means lawful to recover the Purity and Liberty of the Gospel, as it was established and prosessed before teh aforesaid Novations: And because after due examination We plainly perceive, and undoubtedly believe, that the Innovations and Evils contained in our Supplications, Complaints and PRotestations have no warrant of the Word of God, are contrary to the Articles of the aforesaid Consessions, to the intention and meaning of the blessed Reformers of Religion in this Land, to the above written Acts of Parliament, and do sensibly tend to the reestablishing of the Popish Religion and Tyranny, and to the subversion and ruin of the true Reformed Religion, and of our Liberties, Laws and Estates; We also declare, that the aforesaid Consessions are to be interpreted, and ought to be understood of the aforesaid Novations and Evils, no less than if every one of them had bin expressed in the foresaid Consessions; and that we are obliged to detest and abhor them, amongst other particular Heads of Papistry abjured therein; And therefore from the knowledge and Conscience of our Duty to God, to our King and Country, without any worldly respect or inducement, so far as humane infirmity will suffer, wishing a further measure of the Grace of God for this effect, We promise and swear by the great Name of the Lord our God, To continue in the prosession and obedience of the aforesaid Religion; That we shall desend the same, adn any thing another, in the same Cause of maintaining the true Religion, and his Majesty's Authority, with our best Counsels, our selves soul Aspersions of Rebellion, Combination, or what else our Adversaries from their Craft
and Malice would put upon Us, seeing what We do is so well warranted, and ariseth from an unseigned desire to maintain the True Worship of God, the Majesty of Our King, and the Peace of the Kingdom, for the common happiness of Our selves and Posterity. And because We cannot look for a Blessing from God upon Our Proceedings, except with Our Prosession and Subscription, We join such a Life and Conversation as beseemeth Christians, who have renewed their Covenant with God; We therefore faithfully promise, for Our Selves, Our Followers, and all other under Us, both in publick, in Our particular Families, and personal Carriage, to endeavour to keep Our selves unseigned Resolution, as we shall answer to Jesus Christ in the great Day, and under the pain of God's everlasting Wrath, and of Insamy, and of loss of all Honour and Respect in this World: Most humbly beseeching the Lord to strengthen Us by his Holy Spirit for this end, and to bless Our Desires and Proceedings with a happy Success, that Religion and Reighteousness may flourish in the Land, to the Glory of God, the Honour of Our King, and Peace and Comfort of Us all.
'In Witness whereof We have subscribed with Our Hands all the Premises, &c.
This Covenant was no sooner framed, but it so took, as it was presently sworn, first at Edinburgh, in the Month of February 1638 Scottish style, and then every-where through the Country, to be subscribed according to the Example of those in Edinburgh.
K. D. p. 7.
It is observed i teh King's Declaration, That whereas the Band annexed to the former Consession, was made in defence of the King's Authority and Person, with their Fortunes, Bodies, and Lives, in defence of the Gospel of Christ, and Liberties of the Kingdom, &c. But to this Covenant (faith the Declaration ) they have added a mutual Defence of one another, and made against all Persons whatsoever, who shall oppose them in their Courses, not excepting the King himself; neither was the King's consent to this their New Covenant ever granted, nor ever so much as once asked.
The Proclamation dated Feb. 19, and published at Sterling, was so far from giving satisfaction, that it produced greater consusion; for it met with a Protestation sent from those of the Tables, who not withstanding the Proclamation, continued to sit. Whereupon the Council appointed a solemn Meeting to be upon the first of March at Sterling, for the examining of Things, that they might send their Advice to Court. When the first of March came, the Lord Chancellor sent his Excuse, the rest of the Bishops declined to come, except Bishop Brechin: Nevertheless the Lords of the Council went on, and continued consulting and debating four days together; the issue of which was, to send Sir John Hamilton, the Justice Clerk, to the King with Instructions, to this effect.
'In the first place you are to receive from the Clerk of the Council, all the Acts past since Our meeting upon the 1st of March instant.
'Item, You have to represent to his Majesty, That the Diet of Council was appointed to be solemnly kept, by the Advice of the Lord Chancellor, and Remanant Lords of the Clergy being at Edinburgh for the time, who assured Us, That they should keep the Diet precisely; but at Our meeting at Sterling, We received a Letter of Excuse from the Lord Chancellor, which forces Us to proceed without his Lordships presence, or any others of the Lords of the Clergy, except the Bishop of Brechin, who attended Us three days, but removed before the closing of Our Opinions anent the Business.
Item, 'That immediately after We had resolved to direct you with a Letter of Trust to his Majesty, We did send Our Letter to the Lord Chancellor, acquainting him with Our Proceedings, and desiring him to consider thereof; and if he approved the same, to Sign them, and to cause the Remanant Lords of the Clergy nearest unto him, and namely the Bishop of Brechine, who was an Ear and Eye-Witness to our Consultations, to sign the same, and by their Letter to His Majesty, to signify their Approbation thereof; or if his Lordship did find some other way more convenient for His Majesty's Honour, and the Peace of the Country, that his Lordship-by his Letter to the Lord Treasurer or Privy-Seal, would acquaint them therewith, to the effect they might convene the Council for consulting thereabout.
Item, 'That you shew His Majesty, That His Majesty's Councils, all in one Voice, find, That the Causes of the general Combustions in the Country, are the Fears apprehended of Innovation of Religion and Discipline of the Kirk, (established by the Laws of the Kingdom) by occasion of the Service-Book, Book of Canons, and High-Commission, and from the Introduction thereof, contrary to, or without Warrant of the Laws of the Kingdom.
Item, 'You are to present to His Majesty, Our humble Opinion, that seeing, and as We conceive the Service-Book, Book of Canons and High-Commission (as it is set down) are the occasion of this Combustion; and that the Subjects offer themselves upon peril of their Lives, to clear, That the said Service-Book, and others aforesaid, contain divers Points contrary to the Religion presently processed, and Laws of the Kingdom, in matter and manner of Introduction, that the Lords think it expedient that it be represented to his Majesty's gracious Consideration, if His Majesty may be pleased to declare, as an Act of His singular Justice, That He will take Trial of His Subjects Grievances, and the Reasons thereof, in his own Time, and in His own Way, according to the Laws of this Kingdom; and that His Majesty may be pleased graciously to declare, That in the mean time he will not press nor urge His Subjects therewith, notwithstanding any Act of Warrant made in the contrary.
'And in case his Majesty shall be graciously pleased to approve of our humble Opinions, you are thereafter to present to his Majesty's gracious and wise Consideration, if it shall not be sitting to consult his Majesty's Council, or some such of them as he shall be pleased to call to himself, or allow to be sent from the Table, both about the Time and way of doing it.
'And if his Majesty (as God forbid) shall dislike of what we have conceived most conducing to his Majesty's Service, and Peace of the Kingdom, you are to urge, by all teh Arguments you can, That his Majesty do not determine upon any other Course, until some at least of his Council from this, be heard to give the Reasons of their Opinions: And in this case you are likewise to present to his Majesty's Consideration, if it shall not be sitting and necessary to call for his Informers, together with some of his Council, that in his own presence he may hear the Reasons of both informations fully debated.
'You shall likewise shew his Majesty, That this Council having taken to their Consideration what further was to be done for composing and setling of the present Combustion within that Kingdom, and dissipating of the Convocations and Gatherings within the same, seeing Proclamations are already made and published, discharging all such Convocations and unlawful Meetings; the Lords after debating, find they can do no further than is already done herein, until his Majesty's Pleasure be returned to this our humble Remonstrance.
Signed,
These Instructions being transmitted to the Lords of the Clergy, were returned signed as follows.
These Instructions were seconded by a private Letter to the King signed by Traquair and Roxborough, to the effect following.
Most Sacred Soveraign,Although the miserable Estate of this poor Kingdom, will be sufficiently under stood by your Majesty from this Gentleman Sir John Hamilton's Relation; yet we conceive our selves ina special manner bound and obliged to represent what we conceive does so nearly concern your Majesty's Honour and Service; and therefore give us leave truly and faithfully to tell your Majesty, That since the last Proclamation, the fear of Innovation fo Religion is so apprehended by all sorts of Subjects, from all Corners of this kingdom, that there is nothing to be seen here but a general Combustion, and all men strengthening them selves by subscribing Bands, and by all other means, for refusing of that which they seem so much to fear. This is come to such a height, and daily like to encrease more and more, that we see not a probability of Force or Power within this Kingdom to repress this Fury, except your Majesty may be graciously pleased, by some Act of your own, to secure them of that which they seem so much to apprehend by the inbringing of the Books of Common-Prayer, and Canons.
The way which the Subjects have taken, and daily go about in the prosecution of their Business is inexcusable, and no ways agreeable to the Duty of good Subjects. But your Majesty is wisely to consider what is the best and safest couse for your own Honour, and Peace of your Government: And since Religion is pretended to be the Cause of all, if it shall not be a safe Course to free them at this time from Fears, by which means the wiser sort will be satisfied, and so your Majesty enabled, with less pain or trouble, to overtake the Insolencies of any who shall be found to have kicked against Authority.
We are the rather moved at this time be of this Opinion, That having found it the Opinion, not only of those to whom your Majesty wrote in particular, (except of the Marquess of Huntley, who as yet is not come from the North) but of most of the Noblemen, and Men of respect within this Kindgom. We find few or none well satisfied with the Business, or to whom we dare advise your Majesty to trust in the prosecution thereof; and if any have or shall inform your Majesty to the contrary, give us leave humbly to intreat your Majesty to be pleased to call them before your Self, that in our presence you may hear the Reasons of both Informations fully debated.
So praying God to grant your Majesty many happy days, and full contentment in all your Roial Designs, we humbly take our leave, and rest,
Your Majesty's humble Servants,and faithful Subjects,Traquaire,Roxborough.
Sterling, March 5. 1638.
There was also a publick Letter written by the Council to the Marquess, dated at Sterling the 5th of March, sent by Sir John Hamilton, informing the Marquets, 'That they did find the Subjects Fears and 'Stirs to increase since the last Proclamation, and appointed the Council to meet then to consult upon the growth of publick Evils, and
Remedies thereof. After the Council had spent four days in advising, they resolved to send Sir John Hamilton, one of their number, with a Letter from them to his Majesty, to whom they have imparted their Opinions and Reasons of the same Publick Ills, and Remedies of the same, to be represented to his Sacred Majesty, because the Business is so weighty and important, that in their Opinion the Peace of the Country was never in so great hazard; they have thought fit to recommend the Business to your Lordships consideration.
Signed by the same Privy-Councellors, whose Hands were to Sir John Hamilton 's Instructions.
After Sir John Hamilton 's arrival at the Court at Whitehall, and having presented to his Majesty what was committed to his trust and care, his Majesty consulted with his Inward Council, as to the Scottish Affairs, and resolved to send Marquess Hamilton as High-Commissioner to Scotland for that Service, hoping by such an Authority to quiet the Fury of the People; and Sir John Hamilton was immediately dispatched again to Scotland, to give notice of the King's Resolution, and that his Majesty's Pleasure should be further known when his High-Commissioner came down.
The Covenanters not long after the Lord Justice Clerk his arrival at Court, made their Application to the Scotish Lords then at Court, complaining of the Privy-Council for harsh usage; and withal sent up their Grievances, signed by Rothes, Cassils, Montrose, to the effect following.

Tell Abu Shahrain (Eridu)
Visited 11.00-13.07, 5 June, 2008
The seven mounds of Eridu lie about 24 km south-west of Ur.
Excavations were conducted by a number of early explorers (J. E. Taylor 1855; R. Campbell Thompson 1918; H. R. Hall 1919) with a major investigation led by Fuad Safar between 1946 and 1949 on behalf of the Iraqi Directorate General of Antiquities.
J. E. Taylor, “Notes on Abu Shahrein and Tell el Lahm”, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 15 (1855), pp. 404-15; J. Oates, “Ur and Eridu: The Prehistory”, Iraq 22 (1960), pp. 32-50; S. Lloyd, “Abu Shahrein: A Memorandum”, Iraq 36 (1974), pp. 129-38; F. Safar, M. A. Mustafa and S. Lloyd, Eridu (Baghdad 1981).
In Sumerian literature Eridu is claimed as one of the most ancient cities in Mesopotamia, said to antedate the mythical Flood and to be the first city to hold kingship. Eighteen successive levels of mud brick temple architecture, dating from the Early Ubaid to the Late Uruk periods, were exposed during the 1940s excavations on Mound 1; the painted pottery recovered provided the basis for the fourfold division of the Ubaid period. An extensive Ubaid period cemetery was also excavated. The remains of a ziggurat of the Ur III period dominate the centre of the mound. Early Dynastic palaces were excavated on mound 2.
The helicopter landed to the north-east of Mound 1. The visit began at a watchtower presumed to have been erected by the Italians in late 2003. The team climbed to the top of the mound; there is evidence of erosion across the site, especially in two deep gulleys which has revealed inscribed bricks. The inspection proceeded to the remains of the dig-house located on the eastern side of the mound. The lower walls of the dig-house, built from ancient baked bricks, could be traced although no examples of inscribed bricks, visible within the structure in 2003, could be seen. Related to these findings is the report, made by Professor Stefano Seminaria, at an event in the Italian Cultural Institute in London on 29 March 2006 announcing the inauguration of the Baghdad Virtual Museum. He related that, on 20 or 21 March 2006, Professor Giovanni Pettinato and Professor Silvia Chiodi had discovered at Eridu a tablet covered with bitumen. They had looked further and found 500 tablets “disturbed by an explosion”. The tablets were said to be literary, historical and lexical. The historical tablets dated from the time of Eannatum, and the latest tablets were from the time of Amar-Suen. This information, or variations of it, was also circulated on various Italian and international websites. Following these revelations, Dr Donny George, then Chairman of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, sent inspectors to Eridu, who reported back that there were no tablets on the surface of the site, but only fragments of stamped bricks from the site of Eridu itself and from sites surrounding Eridu such as Ur. On 19 July 2006, at the 52ène Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale in Münster, Professor Pettinato reported that he had actually only found some 70 stamped bricks at Eridu. It seems, then, that what Pettinato and Chiodi actually found were stamped bricks used to build the modern Eridu dig-house 1.
There is no evidence of looting or of recent visits to the site – car tracks were visible near a neighbouring canal and the site fence, which was not visited; from the air, it was possible to see the posts of the fence. Surface scraping close to the fence is presumably the result of field irrigation. Two site guards, who were not present during the inspection, are based at a village some distance from the mound.
1. In his memoirs (The Interval – A Life in Near eastern Archaeology, Oxford 1986, p. 113), Seton Lloyd wrote of “the almost total lack of building material” for “setting up base” at Eridu. “To solve this we [Lloyd and Safar] felt justified in looting the ruins of Woolley’s old expedition-house at Ur, ten miles away, and bringing in lorry-loads of baked bricks – many of them stamped with royal names, but beautifully intact”.

If you have been in this space for a while, you already know that moms are pretty influential online. It’s one reason why organizations like BlogHer, Social Moms and Clever Girls Collective have become very popular and widely used by fairly large brands. Here is further evidence.
According to a social media study sponsored by Performics of nearly 3,000 participants, moms are more versatile, more present, more active and more engaged users of social networking sites, than other women. Social networking and connecting with other women online rage among Moms. They use it to share their thoughts, experiences and feelings, ask for advice from other moms, look for deals and coupons, research products, communicate with brands and shop.
Here are some key findings, some of which really surprised me:
- Moms are approximately 61% more likely to own a smartphone than other women.
- They are more likely to be active on social networking sites, for example, they are 16% more likely to visit Facebook daily and 46% more likely to visit Google + daily.
- Moms are 75% more likely to trust information they receive from companies through social networking sites than other women.
Moms are also 45% more likely to make a purchase as a result of a recommendation on a social media site than other women which doesn’t surprise me much. They are broken down by vertical:
- Apparel: Moms are 54% more likely to make an apparel purchase
- Automobile: Moms are 64% more likely to make an automobile purchase
- Travel: Moms are 46% more likely to make a travel purchase
The data also shows that moms actively champion their favorite companies and brands on social media. These “mombassadors” are more likely than other women to:
- Recommend companies/brands via social sites (34%)
- Discuss companies/brands on social sites after seeing an ad elsewhere (48%)
- Talk about companies/brands they follow on Facebook (24%)
- Link to a company/brand ad (23%)
- Post interesting or relevant content about a company/brand (50%)

How Proud They Must BeBy now we are all sickeningly familiar with the story of the Brookfield East football field.
How proud the vandals must be, accomplishers of a tremendous feat that required the cloak of darkness to achieve.
How gleeful they must be as they boastfully recount their exploits.
How devastating the impact on the Spartan community.To paraphrase Winston Churchill – never have so few ruined so much for so many. One or a few punks really showed us what they are made of, didn’t they? I say “punks” fully acknowledging that we don’t know who did this, or what their age is. But be they students or adults, be they younger or older, they are most certainly punks.
Let’s call this action what it so clearly is: cowardly, malicious, and criminal. Let’s let the retribution fit the crime if we are fortunate enough to find out who did it.
A Brookfield Treasure
When was the last time you visited the gravesite of a Revolutionary War Veteran? Or walked amongst the resting place of several Civil War Veterans?
On Memorial Day my family and I did this.
We did not travel to Massachusetts or New York; we drove about four miles from our home to Oak Hill Cemetery, right here in Brookfield.
Located on Brookfield Road and immediately adjacent to Brookfield Academy, this beautiful piece of land and history lies in the heart of our own community. Buried there are the remains of Nathan Hatch, a man who served America in the Revolutionary War.
Do you want a giant does of perspective in just a few minutes? Then take a half-hour this fall to walk under the trees of Oak Hill, and to gaze at the headstones bearing 18th Century dates and names. Go back over two hundred years to the lives these people led and the times in which they lived.
Let’s respect this Brookfield treasure in the best way we can.
By visiting it..."

Five Brookfield East athletes sign letters of intent
Two football players, two tracksters, one kicker sign with Midwestern schools
Nine Brookfield athletes - including five from Brookfield East - signed letters of intent with five different colleges Feb. 6, the official signing day.
Here is a closer look at each one and their accomplishments.
Trenton Daniels was a four-year letter winner in track and field and a key contributor to East's 2011 and 2012 state track and field championships. He signed his national letter of intent to compete at the University of Minnesota.
Daniels placed fifth in 2011 and fourth in 2012 in the 400-meter dash at the state meet. He also was a state place-winner in both the 1600 and 3200 relays at the 2012 state meet. Daniels ran a personal-best time last year of 1 minute, 53.59 seconds in the 800.
Alec James, a talented defensive end, signed his National Letter of Intent to play football at Wisconsin. James is one of the most decorated athletes in Brookfield East history and helped football to its greatest three-year run of success ever, including an undefeated Conference Championship last fall.
Some of his awards include being All-Conference, All-Region, All-Suburban and All-Waukesha County. He was the Greater Metro Conference Defensive Lineman of the Year twice; Player of the Year for the Journal Sentinel, Waukesha Freeman and Now Community Newspapers; All State two years in a row and was selected the Wisconsin Football Coaches Association State Defensive Player of the Year.
James was also elected MVP and Captain by his teammates, played in the U.S. Marine National All Star Game in Los Angeles and will play in the WFCA All Star Game this summer.
Brad Johnson was a four-year letter winner and key contributor to 2011 and 2012 state championship track and field teams. Johnson signed a national letter of intent to compete in track and field at the University of Minnesota.
Johnson is the reigning state champion in the 800 run and was also a state place winner last year in both the 1600 and 3200 relays. His time of 1:51.43 in the 800 currently stands as the fourth best all-time in Wisconsin history.
Brian Smith will be attending the University of Minnesota to play football after an outstanding career, playing an integral part of an undefeated Conference Champion and three straight playoff teams. Smith achieved many honors including All-Conference, All-Region, All-Suburban and All-Waukesha County.
He was selected Defensive Back of the Year by the Greater Metro Conference coaches and was a first-team All-State player at Defensive Back. Smith will also play in the WFCA All-Star Game this summer. Smith was a rare two-way starter that will be sorely missed on both sides of the ball.
Jackie Wandt, a senior midfielder, signed her letter of intent to play soccer at Northern Illinois University next year. A four-year starter on a team that has qualified for the sectional finals in two of the last three years, Wandt followed her Honorable Mention freshman season with second-team all-conference recognition her sophomore year. She was injured for much of her junior.
