"IIf a 'burn notice' is an instruction to ignore henceforth all communication and activity of someone previously thought to be acting on your behalf, then I regard myself as one of the first recipients. Because I had championed women's rights before I took office yet addressed other priorities when in government (such as the conflagration being stoked in the name of the Kaiser), Christabel Pankhurst arranged to burn down the house that was being built for me.

How to Clean a Carpet in a Green Way
Wall to wall carpeting can be a wonderful luxury; it feels good under your feet and can look really lovely when it is kept clean. Unfortunately like everything else it has its down sides as well. The bad thing about carpet is that it doesn't stay clean. Even after cleaning and vacuuming you are left with all the dirt, dust, dander, and other hazards that your carpet collects deep into the fibers. Calling a professional carpet cleaner may sound like a good option but is it? It may be expensive plus they may use toxic chemicals to clean your carpets and leave it soaking wet for a very long time which can contribute to mold and mildew growth. You can clean your carpet in a "green" way. Does this Spark an idea?
Instructions
Clean Your Carpet in a Green Way
- 1
Start by getting a vacuum that really sucks…in a good way. You want a vacuum with a HEPA filter that can suck up and trap all the dirt, dust and allergens that may be in your carpet. Vacuum really well a couple times a week. This will keep dust and dirt particles to a minimum. By thoroughly vacuuming regularly you are keeping all the dirt and dust to a minumum in your carpet fibers. This helps keep it clean and stop the dirt from being ground deep into the carpet.
- 2
Invest in a pump sprayer, like one you would use for outdoor staining or gardening. This is what you can put your mixture of carpet cleaning solution and water in to gently spray onto your carpets for cleaning. Most garden centerc carry sveral types. A small cheap one is fine. Don't get anything that will be too heavy for you to carry once it is full of water and cleaning solution.
- 3
Purchase a carpet shampooer, Bissell steam cleaner, or rent a Rug Doctor from your local grocery store. Do not fill it with water or use the shampoos that they suggest you use. Regular carpet shampoos are filled with harsh detergents and soap which does more damage than good. It leaves a residue on your carpet which will actually attract dirt faster than if you didn’t clean it at all. The only thing you want the vacuum/rug doctor for is to suck up your cleaning solution, not to put any wetness into the carpet.
- 4
Get great, natural carpet cleaning products like Bi-O-Kleen’s Bonnet Cleaner carpet cleaning solution. This is a great all natural cleaner that leaves no nasty residue on your carpet. Seventh Generation’s spray carpet cleaning solution is an excellent choice for spot cleaning. It gets nasty stains out easily. Both can be found in many natural stores and online retailers. If you have heavy duty stains you might also want to try Bi-O-Kleen’s Traffic Lane Cleaner, this can be mixed with the Bonnet Cleaner.
- 5
Move all your furniture and vacuum your carpets really well with your HEPA filter vacuum.
- 6
Mix your carpet cleaning solution and water (follow directions on label for amounts) in your pump sprayer. Use hot water.
- 7
Spray the solution all over your carpet. You want it to be wet but not drenched.
- 8
Use the mixed solution or a carpet spotter in a spray bottle, like Seventh Generation’s carpet cleaner and spray directly onto any stains. Nudge these with your foot and work the solution in.
- 9
Use your rug doctor/wet dry vacuum and start sucking up all the solution out of your carpet. This should get everything nice and clean without leaving a residue or toxic odors behind.
- 10
To make sure your carpets dry as fast as possible plug in fans to circulate the air and turn on overhead ceiling fans if you have any.
Tips & Warnings
It may seem like an investment to buy a new vacuum or a wet/dry vacuum or carpet cleaner but if you already have them it’s about time you put them to good use and if you do have to make the investment it will save your money and your health in the long run. And the solutions that you buy will last for many, many cleanings.
Try to avoid brand new carpet. It is especially hazardous because of the toxic fumes that can be released during installation and long after. If you have chemical sensitivities, allergies, asthma or other health conditions you may want to avoid new carpet altogether, unless it is an eco-friendly choice made without chemicals.

So I put back my skinny jeans, flowy top, and ballet flats and made a bee-line for the closest Target store. Here’s what I found:
Comfy Sneakers with Support. These made it through eleven hours of amusement park madness that included all of the stair climbing, standing in line, and running (yes, I said running….how else were we going to manage to beat strollers, packs of children, and other thrill-seekers to the front of the line?) that you could imagine. With these, my feet were not nearly as tired as I’d expected.
Endurance Tee. Wearing a loose tee shirt helped reduce the amount of sunscreen I had to slather on my upper body and the material of this particular one was sweat and water resistant—always a plus!Cross-body lightweight bag. The small shoulder purse that I intended to bring would not have allowed the hands-free result of a cross-body bag. This one that I found worked great and managed to hold wallets, phones, cameras, souvenirs, sunglasses, and car keys for two!
So overall, the fashion-forward outfit that I had originally planned to wear did not suffice. And although I ended up looking like I just walked out of yoga class, I was very happy to have friend remind me that Disneyland is not a Runway and when standing next to Mickey Mouse….no one is looking at you.
We love hearing from you!

A surgical breast biopsy requires an incision in the skin. This allows your doctor to take a large sample of tissue from the breast. In fact, the whole lump is often removed. The sample is then sent to a lab for study.
A lump that can’t be felt may be hard to locate. In such a case, one or more guide wires may be placed in your breast before biopsy surgery. These thin wires help mark the tissue that is to be removed. A mammogram or ultrasound is used to direct the wire’s placement. Then you’re taken to the operating room for surgery. The wire is removed during the biopsy.
Large core biopsy uses a hollow instrument to remove a tissue sample. A small incision is made in the skin. The hollow instrument is inserted through this incision. A local anesthetic will be used to numb the site. Before the biopsy, a guide wire may be placed to mark the breast mass. Often the entire mass is removed. Large core biopsy takes about an hour to perform. Due to the size of the sample removed, stitches are often needed.
Open surgical biopsy removes a tissue sample through a skin incision. To keep you from feeling pain during the biopsy, you are likely to be given intravenous sedation. This produces a light sleep. Your surgeon then makes one.

The sutures or staples have come out, and the surgical wound has healed. Now you can begin to prepare your residual limb for a prosthesis. During this time, keep these goals in mind:
Proper positioning of your residual limb
Muscle stretching and strengthening
Touch and desensitization
Residual limb shaping
Daily limb care and hygiene
Keeping your residual limb in the right position is vital. This helps prevent muscle shortening and tightening (contracture), which prevents full range of motion. To avoid contracture, you’ll need to keep your knee and hip as straight as you can. Here’s how to do this:
When seated, always support your residual limb to keep it from dangling or hanging. When sitting in a wheelchair or a regular chair, you can use an “amputee board.” This is a flat board that sticks out to support the weight of your residual limb.
Spend time every day lying flat on your stomach (proning). Proning stretches the muscles at the front of your hip. These muscles get tight when you sit. It’s important to spend 15-20 minutes proning several times a day.
Don’t prop your residual limb on pillows or blankets when you sit or lie down. Keep your residual limb flat, with your knee as straight as you can.
If the amputation is above the knee, keep your residual limb close to the intact leg. Allowing it to move outward may make it difficult to walk with a prosthesis later.
You need to keep the muscles in your residual limb strong and limber. Keep doing the exercises you were taught in the hospital. This will help prevent contracture. It also ensures that your intact limb and residual limb are strong and flexible. Both legs need to be strong to walk with a prosthesis.
At first, the skin on your residual limb will be sensitive to touch. Desensitization can help. This involves massaging, rubbing, and tapping the end of your residual limb. Begin with a light, gentle touch. As your tolerance improves, slowly increase pressure. This helps prepare you for your first prosthesis fitting.
Even after the surgical wound has healed, your residual limb can still be swollen. Swelling must be reduced so your residual limb will fit into the socket of a prosthesis. This process is called “shaping” the residual limb. Your healthcare provider will prescribe a compression stocking to shape your residual limb. Remember:
Wear the compression stocking (shrinker sock). This is a tapered sock that applies even pressure to the bottom of the residual limb. Pressure helps reduce swelling.
Wear the shrinker sock as close to 24 hours a day as possible (except when bathing). Keep it pulled tight to maintain a snug fit at all times.
See your prosthetist regularly. The prosthetist will monitor the changing size of your limb through the entire fitting process. This helps to ensure the prosthesis fits correctly.
Keeping your residual limb clean is vital to prevent skin problems and infection. Do the following every day:
Wash your residual limb at least once a day. Use warm water and a mild antibacterial soap.
Using a washcloth, scrub gently over all surfaces of the residual limb. Pay close attention to the skin behind your knee and on the bottom of your limb.
Dry your residual limb thoroughly. This keeps moisture from being trapped between your skin and the shrinker sock.
Wear a clean shrinker sock every day. Wash each sock with mild soap and water, rinse well, and air dry completely. This removes salts and acids left by your sweat.
Inspect your residual limb daily, especially the skin of the surgical scar. Use a mirror to check the back of your limb. Or ask a family member or friend to help. Call the doctor if you notice the following:
Skin separation along the surgical scar
Scar or residual limb has a bad smell
Area around the scar is warm or hot, or becomes red or swollen
Pus or yellow drainage from the scar, or thick discharge that is brownish gray
Sudden increase in pain or severe tenderness
Fever of 100.4°F or higher

Case
[1] "It's been quite a year," thought Tom Moline." On top of
their normal efforts at hunger advocacy and education on campus,
the twenty students in the Hunger Concerns group were spending the
entire academic year conducting an extensive study of hunger in
sub-Saharan Africa. Tom's girlfriend, Karen Lindstrom, had
proposed the idea after she returned from a semester-abroad program
in Tanzania last spring. With tears of joy and sorrow, she
had described for the group the beauty and suffering of the people
and land. Wracked by AIDS, drought, and political unrest, the
nations in the region are also fighting a losing war against hunger
and malnutrition. While modest gains have been made for the
more than 800 million people in the world that are chronically
malnourished, sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world
where the number of hungry people is actually increasing. It
was not hard for Karen to persuade the group to focus attention on
this problem and so they decided to devote one of their two
meetings per month to this study. In the fall, Karen and Tom
led three meetings examining root causes of hunger in various forms
of powerlessness wrought by poverty, war, and drought.
[2] What Tom had not expected was the special attention the
group would give to the potential which biotechnology poses for
improving food security in the region. This came about for
two reasons. One was the participation of Adam Paulsen in the
group. Majoring in economics and management, Adam had spent
last summer as an intern in the Technology Cooperation Division of
Monsanto. Recognized, and often vilified, as a global leader
in the field of agricultural biotechnology, Monsanto has also been
quietly working with agricultural researchers around the world to
genetically modify crops that are important for subsistence
farmers. For example, Monsanto researchers have collaborated
with governmental and non-governmental research organizations to
develop virus-resistant potatoes in Mexico, "golden mustard" rich
in beta-carotene in India, and virus-resistant papaya in Southeast
Asia.
[3] In December, Adam gave a presentation to the group that
focused on the role Monsanto has played in developing
virus-resistant sweet potatoes for Kenya. Sweet potatoes are
grown widely in Kenya and other developing nations because they are
nutritious and can be stored beneath the ground until they need to
be harvested. The problem, however, is that pests and
diseases can reduce yields by up to 80 percent. Following
extensive research and development that began in 1991, the Kenyan
Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) began field tests of
genetically modified sweet potatoes in 2001. Adam concluded
his presentation by emphasizing what an important impact this
genetically modified (GM) crop could have on food security for
subsistence farmers. Even if losses were only cut in half,
that would still represent a huge increase in food for people who
are too poor to buy the food they need.
[4] The second reason the group wound up learning more about the
potential biotechnology poses for increasing food production in
Kenya was because a new member joined the group. Josephine
Omondi, a first-year international student, had read an
announcement about Adam's presentation in the campus newsletter and
knew right away that she had to attend. She was, after all, a
daughter of one of the scientists engaged in biotechnology research
at the KARI laboratories in Nairobi. Struggling with
homesickness, Josephine was eager to be among people that cared
about her country. She was also impressed with the accuracy
of Adam's presentation and struck up an immediate friendship with
him when they discovered they both knew Florence Wambugu, the
Kenyan researcher that had initiated the sweet potato project and
had worked in Monsanto's labs in St. Louis.
[5] Naturally, Josephine had much to offer the group. A
month after Adam's presentation, she provided a summary of other
biotechnology projects in Kenya. In one case, tissue culture
techniques are being employed to develop banana varieties free of
viruses and other diseases that plague small and large-scale banana
plantations. In another case, cloning techniques are being
utilized to produce more hearty and productive chrysanthemum
varieties, a plant that harbors a chemical, pyrethrum, that
functions as a natural insecticide. Kenya grows nearly half
the global supply of pyrethrum, which is converted elsewhere into
environmentally-friendly mosquito repellants and
insecticides.1
[6] Josephine reserved the majority of her remarks, however, for
two projects that involve the development of herbicide- and
insect-resistant varieties of maize (corn). Every year
stem-boring insects and a weed named Striga decimate up to 60
percent of Kenya's maize harvest.2
Nearly 50 percent of the food Kenyans consume is maize, but maize
production is falling. While the population of East Africa
grew by 20 percent from 1989 to 1998, maize harvests actually
declined during this period.3 Josephine
stressed that this is one of the main reasons the number of hungry
people is increasing in her country. As a result, Kenyan
researchers are working in partnership with the International Maize
and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) to develop corn varieties
that can resist Striga and combat stem-borers. With pride,
Josephine told the group that both projects are showing signs of
success. In January 2002, KARI scientists announced they had
developed maize varieties from a mutant that is naturally resistant
to a herbicide which is highly effective against Striga. In a
cost-effective process, farmers would recoverthe small cost of
seeds coated with the herbicide through yield increases of up to
400 percent.4
[7] On the other front, Josephine announced that significant
progress was also being made between CIMMYT and KARI in efforts to
genetically engineer "Bt" varieties of Kenyan maize that would
incorporate the gene that produces Bacillus thuringiensis, a
natural insecticide that is used widely by organic farmers.
Josephine concluded her remarks by saying how proud she was of her
father and the fact that poor subsistence farmers in Kenya are
starting to benefit from the fruits of biotechnology, long enjoyed
only by farmers in wealthy nations.
[8] A few days after Josephine's presentation, two members of
the Hunger Concerns group asked if they could meet with Tom since
he was serving as the group's coordinator. As an
environmental studies major, Kelly Ernst is an ardent advocate of
organic farming and a strident critic of industrial approaches to
agriculture. As much as she respected Josephine, she
expressed to Tom her deep concerns that Kenya was embarking on a
path that was unwise ecologically and economically. She
wanted to have a chance to tell the group about the ways organic
farming methods can combat the challenges posed by stem-borers and
Striga.
[9] Similarly, Terra Fielding thought it was important that the
Hunger Concerns group be made aware of the biosafety and human
health risks associated with genetically modified (GM) crops.
Like Terra, Tom was also a biology major so he understood her
concerns about the inadvertent creation of herbicide-resistant
"superweeds" and the likelihood that insects would eventually
develop resistance to Bt through prolonged exposure. He also
understood Terra's concern that it would be nearly impossible to
label GM crops produced in Kenya since most food goes directly from
the field to the table. As a result, few Kenyans would be
able to make an informed decision about whether or not to eat
genetically-engineered foods. Convinced that both sets of
concerns were significant, Tom invited Kelly and Terra to give
presentations in February and March.
[10] The wheels came off during the meeting in April,
however. At the end of a discussion Tom was facilitating
about how the group might share with the rest of the college what
they had learned about hunger in sub-Saharan Africa, Kelly Ernst
brought a different matter to the attention of the group: a plea to
join an international campaign by Greenpeace to ban GM crops.
In the murmurs of assent and disapproval that followed, Kelly
pressed ahead. She explained that she had learned about the
campaign through her participation in the Environmental Concerns
group on campus. They had decided to sign on to the campaign
and were now actively encouraging other groups on campus to join
the cause as well. Reiterating her respect for Josephine and
the work of her father in Kenya, Kelly nevertheless stressed that
Kenya could achieve its food security through organic farming
techniques rather than the "magic bullet" of GM crops, which she
argued pose huge risks to the well-being of the planet as well as
the welfare of Kenyans.
[11] Before Tom could open his mouth, Josephine offered a
counter proposal. Angry yet composed, she said she fully
expected the group to vote down Kelly's proposal, but that she
would not be satisfied with that alone. Instead, she
suggested that a fitting conclusion to their study this year would
be for the group to submit an article for the college newspaper
explaining the benefits that responsible use of agricultural
biotechnology poses for achieving food security in sub-Saharan
Africa, particularly in Kenya.
[12] A veritable riot of discussion ensued among the twenty
students. The group appeared to be evenly divided over the
two proposals. Since the meeting had already run well past
its normal ending time, Tom suggested that they think about both
proposals and then come to the next meeting prepared to make a
decision. Everybody seemed grateful for the chance to think
about it for a while, especially Tom and Karen.
II
[13] Three days later, an intense conversation was taking place
at a corner table after dinner in the cafeteria.
[14] "Come on, Adam. You're the one that told us people
are hungry because they are too poor to buy the food they need,"
said Kelly. "I can tell you right now that there is plenty of
food in the world; we just need to distribute it better. If
we quit feeding 60 percent of our grain in this country to animals,
there would be plenty of food for everyone."
[15] "That may be true, Kelly, but we don't live in some ideal
world where we can wave a magic wand and make food land on the
tables of people in Africa. A decent food distribution
infrastructure doesn't exist within most of the countries.
Moreover, most people in sub-Saharan Africa are so poor they
couldn't afford to buy our grain. And even if we just gave it
away, all we would do is impoverish local farmers in Africa because
there is no way they could compete with our free food. Until
these countries get on their feet and can trade in the global
marketplace, the best thing we can do for their economic
development is to promote agricultural production in their
countries. Genetically modified crops are just one part of a
mix of strategies that Kenyans are adopting to increase food
supplies. They have to be able to feed themselves."
[16] "Yes, Africans need to feed themselves," said Kelly, "but I
just don't think that they need to follow our high-tech approach to
agriculture. Look at what industrial agriculture has done to
our own country. We're still losing topsoil faster than we
can replenish it. Pesticides and fertilizers are still
fouling our streams and groundwater. Massive monocultures
only make crops more susceptible to plant diseases and pests.
At the same time, these monocultures are destroying
biodiversity. Our industrial approach to agriculture is
living off of biological capital that we are not replacing.
Our system of agriculture is not sustainable. Why in God's
name would we want to see others appropriate it?"
[17] "But that's not what we're talking about," Adam
replied. "The vast majority of farmers in the region are
farming a one hectare plot of land that amounts to less than 2.5
acres. They're not buying tractors. They're not using
fertilizer. They're not buying herbicides. They can't
afford those things. Instead, women and children spend most
of their days weeding between rows, picking bugs off of plants, or
hauling precious water. The cheapest and most important
technology they can afford is improved seed that can survive in
poor soils and resist weeds and pests. You heard Josephine's
report. Think of the positive impact that all of those
projects are going to have for poor farmers in Kenya."
[18] Kelly shook her head. "Come on, Adam. Farmers
have been fighting with the weather, poor soils, and pests
forever. How do you think we survived without modern farming
methods? It can be done. We know how to protect soil
fertility through crop rotations and letting ground rest for a
fallow period. We also know how to intercrop in ways that cut
down on plant diseases and pests. I can show you a great
article in WorldWatch magazine that demonstrates how organic
farmers in Kenya are defeating stem-borers and combating
Striga. In many cases they have cut crop losses down to 5
percent. All without genetic engineering and all the dangers
that come with it."
[19] Finally Karen broke in. "But if that knowledge is so
wide-spread, why are there so many hungry people in Kenya?
I've been to the region. Most farmers I saw already practice
some form of intercropping, but they can't afford to let their land
rest for a fallow period because there are too many mouths to
feed. They're caught in a vicious downward spiral.
Until their yields improve, the soils will continue to become more
degraded and less fertile."
[20] Adam and Kelly both nodded their heads, but for different
reasons. The conversation seemed to end where it began; with
more disagreement than agreement.
III
[21] Later that night, Tom was in the library talking with Terra
about their Entomology exam the next day. It didn't take long
for Terra to make the connections between the material they were
studying and her concerns about Bt crops in Kenya. "Tom, we
both know what has happened with chemical insecticide
applications. After a period of time, the few insects that
have an ability to resist the insecticide survive and
reproduce. Then you wind up with an insecticide that is no
longer effective against pests that are resistant to it. Bt
crops present an even more likely scenario for eventual resistance
because the insecticide is not sprayed on the crop every now and
then. Instead, Bt is manufactured in every cell of the plant
and is constantly present, which means pests are constantly
exposed. While this will have a devastating effect on those
insects that don't have a natural resistance to Bt, eventually
those that do will reproduce and a new class of Bt-resistant
insects will return to munch away on the crop. This would be
devastating for organic farmers because Bt is one of the few
natural insecticides they can use and still claim to be
organic."
[22] "I hear you, Terra. But I know that Bt farmers in the
U.S. are instructed by the seed distributors to plant refuges
around their Bt crops so that some pests will not be exposed to Bt
and will breed with the others that are exposed, thus compromising
the genetic advantage that others may have."
[23] "That's true, Tom, but it's my understanding that farmers
are not planting big enough refuges. The stuff I've read
suggests that if you're planting 100 acres in soybeans, 30 acres
should be left in non-Bt soybeans. But it doesn't appear that
farmers are doing that. And that's here in the States.
How reasonable is it to expect a poor, uneducated farmer in East
Africa to understand the need for a refuge and also to resist the
temptation to plant all of the land in Bt corn in order to raise
the yield?"
[24] As fate would have it, Josephine happened to walk by just
as Terra was posing her question to Tom. In response, she
fired off several questions of her own. "Are you suggesting
Kenyan farmers are less intelligent than U.S. farmers, Terra?
Do you think we cannot teach our farmers how to use these new gifts
in a wise way? Haven't farmers in this country learned from
mistakes they have made? Is it not possible that we too can
learn from any mistakes we make?"
[25] "Josephine, those are good questions. It's just that
we're talking about two very different agricultural
situations. Here you have less than two million farmers
feeding 280 million people. With a high literacy rate, a huge
agricultural extension system, e-mail, and computers, it is
relatively easy to provide farmers with the information they
need. But you said during your presentation that 70 percent
of Kenya's 30 million people are engaged in farming. Do you
really think you can teach all of those people how to properly
utilize Bt crops?"
[26] "First of all, U.S. farmers do not provide all of the food
in this country. Where do you think our morning coffee and
bananas come from? Rich nations import food every day from
developing nations, which have to raise cash crops in order to
import other things they need in order to develop, or to pay debts
to rich nations. You speak in sweeping generalizations.
Obviously not every farmer in Kenya will start planting Bt corn
tomorrow. Obviously my government will recognize the need to
educate farmers about the misuse of Bt and equip them to do
so. We care about the environment and have good policies in
place to protect it. We are not fools, Terra. We are
concerned about the biosafety of Kenya."
[27] Trying to take some of the heat off of Terra, Tom asked a
question he knew she wanted to ask. "What about the dangers
to human health, Josephine? The Europeans are so concerned
they have established a moratorium on all new patents of
genetically-engineered foods and have introduced GM labeling
requirements. While we haven't done that here in the U.S.,
many are concerned about severe allergic reactions that could be
caused by foods made from GM crops. Plus, we just don't know
what will happen over the long term as these genes interact or
mutate. Isn't it wise to be more cautious and go slowly?"
[28] There was nothing slow about Josephine's reply. "Tom,
we are concerned about the health and well-being of our
people. But there is one thing that you people don't
understand. We view risks related to agricultural
biotechnology differently. It is reasonable to be concerned
about the possible allergenicity of GM crops, and we test for
these, but we are not faced primarily with concerns about allergic
reactions in Kenya. We are faced with declining food supplies and
growing numbers of hungry people. As Terra said, our
situations are different. As a result, we view the possible
risks and benefits differently. The people of Kenya should be
able to decide these matters for themselves. We are tired of
other people deciding what is best for us. The colonial era
is over. You people need to get used to it."
[29] With that, Josephine left as suddenly as she had
arrived. Worn out and reflective, both Tom and Terra decided
to return to studying for their exam the next day.
IV
[30] On Friday night, Karen and Tom got together for their
weekly date. They decided to have dinner at a local
restaurant that had fairly private booths. After Karen's
semester in Tanzania last spring, they had learned to cherish the
time they spent together. Eventually they started talking
about the decision the Hunger Concerns group would have to make
next week. After Karen summarized her conversation with Kelly
and Adam, Tom described the exchange he and Terra had with
Josephine.
[31] Karen said, "You know, I realize that these environmental
and health issues are important, but I'm surprised that no one else
seems willing to step back and ask whether anyone should be doing
genetic engineering in the first place. Who are we to mess
with God's creation? What makes us think we can improve on
what God has made?"
[32] "But Karen," Tom replied, "human beings have been mixing
genes ever since we figured out how to breed animals or graft
branches onto apple trees. We didn't know we were engaged in
genetic manipulation, but now we know more about the science of
genetics, and that has led to these new technologies. One of
the reasons we can support six billion people on this planet is
because scientists during the Green Revolution used their God-given
intelligence to develop hybrid stocks of rice, corn, and other
cereal crops that boosted yields significantly. They achieved
most of their success by cross-breeding plants, but that takes a
long time and it is a fairly inexact process. Various
biotechnologies including genetic engineering make it possible for
us to reduce the time it takes to develop new varieties, and they
also enable us to transfer only the genes we want into the host
species. The first Green Revolution passed by Africa, but
this second biotechnology revolution could pay huge dividends for
countries in Africa."
[33] "I understand all of that, Tom. I guess what worries
me is that all of this high science will perpetuate the myth that
we are masters of the universe with some God-given mandate to
transform nature in our image. We have got to quit viewing
nature as a machine that we can take apart and put back
together. Nature is more than the sum of its parts.
This mechanistic mindset has left us with all sorts of major
ecological problems. The only reason hybrid seeds produced so
much food during the Green Revolution is because we poured tons of
fertilizer on them and kept them alive with irrigation water.
And what was the result? We produced lots of grain but also
huge amounts of water pollution and waterlogged soils. We
have more imagination than foresight. And so we wind up
developing another technological fix to get us out of the problem
our last technological innovation produced. Instead, we need
to figure out how to live in harmony with nature. Rather than
be independent, we need to realize our ecological
interdependence. We are made from the dust of the universe
and to the dust of the earth we will return."
[34] "Huh, I wonder if anyone would recognize you as a religion
major, Karen? I agree that our scientific and technological
abilities have outpaced our wisdom in their use, but does that mean
we can't learn from our mistakes? Ultimately, aren't
technologies just means that we put to the service of the ends we
want to pursue? Why can't we use genetic engineering to end
hunger? Why would God give us the brains to map and
manipulate genomes if God didn't think we could use that knowledge
to better care for creation? Scientists are already
developing the next wave of products that will give us inexpensive
ways to vaccinate people in developing nations from debilitating
diseases with foods like bananas that carry the vaccine. We
will also be able to make food more nutritious for those that get
precious little. Aren't those good things, Karen?"
[35] Karen, a bit defensive and edging toward the other side of
the horseshoe-shaped booth, said, "Look Tom, the way we live is
just not sustainable. It scares me to see people in China,
and Mexico, and Kenya all following us down the same unsustainable
road. There has got to be a better way. Kelly is
right. Human beings lived more sustainably in the past than
we do now. We need to learn from indigenous peoples how to
live in harmony with the earth. But instead, we seem to be
tempting them to adopt our expensive and inappropriate
technologies. It just doesn't seem right to encourage
developing nations like Kenya to make huge investments in
biotechnology when less expensive solutions might better address
their needs. I really do have my doubts about the ability to
teach farmers how to use these new seeds wisely. I've been
there, Tom. Farmers trade seeds freely and will always follow
a strategy that will produce the most food in the short-term
because people are hungry now. Eventually, whatever gains are
achieved by biotechnology will be lost as weeds and insects become
resistant or the soils just give out entirely from overuse.
But I am really struggling with this vote next week because I also
know that we should not be making decisions for other people.
They should be making decisions for themselves. Josephine is
my friend. I don't want to insult her. But I really do
think Kenya is heading down the wrong road."
[36] "So how are you going to vote next week, Karen?"
[37] "I don't know, Tom. Maybe I just won't show up.
How are you going to vote?"
Commentary
[38] This commentary offers background information on global
food security, agricultural biotechnology, and genetically modified
organisms before it turns to general concerns about genetically
modified crops and specific ethical questions raised by the
case.
Food Security
[39] The nations of the world made significant gains in social
development during the latter half of the 20th century. Since 1960,
life expectancy has risen by one third in developing nations, child
mortality has been cut in half, the percentage of people who have
access to clean water has more than doubled, and the total
enrollment in primary schools has increased by nearly two- thirds.
Similar progress has been made in achieving a greater measure of
food security. Even though the world's population has more than
doubled since 1960, food production grew at a slightly faster rate
so that today per capita food availability is up 24 percent. More
importantly, the proportion of people who suffer from food
insecurity has been cut in half from 37 percent in 1969 to 18
percent in 1995.5
[40] According to the International Food Policy Research
Institute, the world currently produces enough food to meet the
basic needs for each of the planet's six billion people.
Nevertheless, more than 800 million people suffer from food
insecurity. For various reasons, one out of every eight human
beings on the planet cannot produce or purchase the food they need
to lead healthy, productive lives. One out of every three
preschool-age children in developing nations is either malnourished
or severely underweight.6 Of these, 14 million children
become blind each year due to Vitamin A deficiency. Every day,
40,000 people die of illnesses related to their poor
diets.7
[41] Food security is particularly dire in sub-Saharan Africa. It
is the only region in the world where hunger has been increasing
rather than decreasing. Since 1970, the number ofmalnourished
people has increased as the amount of food produced per person has
declined.8
According to the United Nations Development Programme, half of the
673 million people living in sub-Saharan Africa at the beginning of
the 21st century are living in absolute poverty on less than $1 a
day.9 Not
surprisingly, one third of the people are undernourished. In the
eastern portion of this region, nearly half of the children suffer
from stunted growth as a result of their inadequate diets, and that
percentage is increasing.10 In Kenya, 23 percent of
children under the age of five suffer from
malnutrition.11
[42] Several factors contribute to food insecurity in sub-Saharan
Africa. Drought, inadequate water supplies, and crop losses to
pests and disease have devastating impacts on the amount of food
that is available. Less obvious factors, however, often have a
greater impact on food supply. Too frequently, governments in the
region spend valuable resources on weapons, which are then used in
civil or regional conflicts that displace people and reduce food
production. In addition, many governments-hamstrung by
international debt obligations-have pursued economic development
strategies that bypass subsistence farmers and focus on the
production of cash crops for export. As a result, a few countries
produce significant amounts of food, but it is shipped to wealthier
nations and is not available for local consumption. Storage and
transportation limitations also result in inefficient distribution
of surpluses when they are produced within nations in the
region.12
[43] Poverty is another significant factor. Globally, the gap
between the rich and the poor is enormous. For example, the $1,010
average annual purchasing power of a Kenyan pales in comparison
with the $31,910 available to a citizen of the United
States.13 Poor
people in developing nations typically spend 50-80 percent of their
incomes for food, in comparison to the 10-15 percent that people
spend in the United States or the European Union.14 Thus, while food may be
available for purchase, fluctuating market conditions often drive
prices up to unaffordable levels. In addition, poverty limits the
amount of resources a farmer can purchase to "improve" his or her
land and increase yields. Instead, soils are worked without rest in
order to produce food for people who already have too little to
eat.
[44] One way to deal with diminished food supplies or high prices
is through the ability to grow your own food. Over 70 percent of
the people living in sub-Saharan Africa are subsistence farmers,
but the amount of land available per person has been declining over
the last thirty years. While the concentration of land in the hands
of a few for export cropping plays an important role in this
problem, the primary problem is population growth in the region. As
population has grown, less arable land and food is available per
person. In 1970, Asia, Latin America, and Africa all had similar
population growth rates. Since then Asia has cut its rate of growth
by 25 percent, and Latin America has cut its rate by 20
percent.15 In
contrast, sub-Saharan Africa still has a very high population
growth rate, a high fertility rate, and an age structure where 44
percent of its population is under the age of fifteen. As a result,
the United Nations projects that the region's population will more
than double by 2050, even after taking into account the devastating
impact that AIDS will continue to have on many
countries.16
[45] Local food production will need to increase substantially in
the next few decades in order to meet the 133 percent projected
growth of the population in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, food aid
donations from donor countries only represent 1.1 percent of the
food supply. The region produces 83 percent of its own food and
imports the rest.17 Given the limited financial
resources of these nations, increasing imports is not a viable
strategy for the future. Instead, greater efforts must be made to
stimulate agricultural production within the region, particularly
among subsistence farmers. Unlike Asia, however, increased
production will not likely be achieved through the irrigation of
fields and the application of fertilizer. Most farmers in the
region are simply too poor to afford these expensive inputs.
Instead, the main effort has been to improve the least expensive
input: seeds.
[46] A great deal of public and private research is focused on
developing new crop varieties that are resistant to drought, pests,
and disease and are also hearty enough to thrive in poor
soils.18 While
the vast majority of this research utilizes traditional
plant-breeding methods, nations like Kenya and South Africa are
actively researching ways that the appropriate use of biotechnology
can also increase agricultural yields. These nations, and a growing
list of others, agree with a recent statement by the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization:
[47]…. It [genetic engineering] could lead to
higher yields on marginal lands in countries that today cannot grow
enough food to feed their people. 19
Agricultural Biotechnology
[48] The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
defines biotechnology as "any technological application that uses
biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to
make or modify products or processes for specific
use."20 The
modification of living organisms is not an entirely new
development, however. Human beings have been grafting branches onto
fruit trees and breeding animals for desired traits since the
advent of agriculture 10,000 years ago. Recent advances in the
fields of molecular biology and genetics, however, considerably
magnify the power of human beings to understand and transform
living organisms.
[49] The cells of every living thing contain genes that determine
the function and appearance of the organism. Each cell contains
thousands of genes. Remarkably, there is very little difference in
the estimated number of genes in plant cells (26,000) and human
cells (30,000). Within each cell, clusters of these genes are
grouped together in long chains called chromosomes. Working in
isolation or in combination, these genes and chromosomes determine
the appearance, composition, and functions of an organism. The
complete list of genes and chromosomes in a particular species is
called the genome.21
[50] Like their predecessors, plant breeders and other
agricultural scientists are making use of this rapidly growing body
of knowledge to manipulate the genetic composition of crops and
livestock, albeit with unprecedented powers. Since the case focuses
only on genetically modified crops, this commentary will examine
briefly the use in Africa of the five most common applications of
biotechnology to plant breeding through the use of tissue culture,
marker-assisted selection, genetic engineering, genomics, and
bioinformatics.22
[51] Tissue culture techniques enable researchers to develop whole
plants from a single cell, or a small cluster of cells. After
scientists isolate the cell of a plant that is disease-free or
particularly hearty, they then use cloning techniques to produce
large numbers of these plants in vitro, in a petri dish. When the
plants reach sufficient maturity in the laboratory, they are
transplanted into agricultural settings where farmers can enjoy the
benefits of crops that are more hearty or disease-free. In the
case, Josephine describes accurately Kenyan successes in this area
with regard to bananas and the plants that produce pyrethrum. This
attempt to micro-propagate crops via tissue cultures constitutes
approximately 52 percent of the activities in the 37 African
countries engaged in various forms of biotechnology
research.23
[52] Marker-assisted selection techniques enable researchers to
identify desirable genes in a plant's genome. The identification
and tracking of these genes speeds up the process of conventional
cross-breeding and reduces the number of unwanted genes that are
transferred. The effort to develop insect-resistant maize in Kenya
uses this technology to identify local varieties of maize that have
greater measures of natural resistance to insects and disease.
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Côte d'Ivoire are all
building laboratories to conduct this form of research.
24
[53] Genetic engineering involves the direct transfer of genetic
material between organisms. Whereas conventional crossbreeding
transfers genetic material in a more indirect and less efficient
manner through the traditional propagation of plants, genetic
engineering enables researchers to transfer specific genes directly
into the genome of a plant in vitro. Originally, scientists used
"gene guns" to shoot genetic material into cells. Increasingly,
researchers are using a naturally occurring plant pathogen,
Agrobacterium tumefaciens, to transfer genes more successfully and
selectively into cells. Eventually, Josephine's father intends to
make use of this technology to "engineer" local varieties of maize
that will include a gene from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a
naturally occurring bacterium that interferes with the digestive
systems of insects that chew or burrow into plants. Recent reports
from South Africa indicate thatsmallholder farmers who have planted
a Bt variety of cotton have experienced "great
success."25
[54] Genomics is the study of how all the genes in an organism
work individually or together to express various traits. The
interaction of multiple genes is highly complex and studies aimed
at discerning these relationships require significant computing
power. Bioinformatics moves this research a step further by taking
this genomic information and exploring the ways it may be relevant
to understanding the gene content and gene order of similar
organisms. For example, researchers recently announced that they
had successfully mapped the genomes of two different rice
varieties.26
This information will likely produce improvements in rice yields,
but researchers drawing on the new discipline of bioinformatics
will also explore similarities between rice and other cereal crops
that have not yet been mapped. Nations like Kenya, however, have
not yet engaged in these two forms of biotechnology research
because of the high cost associated with the required computing
capacity.
Genetically Modified Organisms in Agriculture
[55] The first genetically modified organisms were
developed for industry and medicine, not agriculture. In 1972, a
researcher working for General Electric engineered a microbe that
fed upon spilled crude oil, transforming the oil into a more benign
substance. When a patent was applied for the organism, the case
made its way ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1980
ruled that a patent could be awarded for the modification of a
living organism. One year earlier, scientists had managed to splice
the gene that produces human growth hormone into a bacterium, thus
creating a new way to produce this vital hormone.27
[56] In 1994, Calgene introduced the Flavr-Savr tomato. It was the
first commercially produced, genetically modified food product.
Engineered to stay on the vine longer, develop more flavor, and
last longer on grocery shelves, consumers rejected the product not
primarily because it was genetically modified, but rather because
it was too expensive and did not taste any better than ordinary
tomatoes.28
[57] By 1996, the first generation of genetically modified (GM)
crops was approved for planting in six countries. These crops
included varieties of corn, soybeans, cotton, and canola that had
been engineered to resist pests or to tolerate some herbicides.
Virus resistance was also incorporated into some tomato, potato,
and tobacco varieties.
[58] Farmers in the United States quickly embraced these
genetically modified varieties because they reduced the cost of
pesticide and herbicide applications, and in some cases also
increased yields substantially. In 1996, 3.6 million acres were
planted in GM crops. By 2000 that number had grown to 75 million
acres and constituted 69 percent of the world's production of GM
crops.29
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2002 spring
survey, 74 percent of the nation's soybeans, 71 percent of cotton,
and 32 percent of the corn crop were planted in genetically
engineered varieties, an increase of approximately 5 percent over
2001 levels.30
[59] Among other developed nations, Canada produced 7 percent of
the world's GM crops in 2000, though Australia, France, and Spain
also had plantings.31 In developing nations, crop
area planted in GM varieties grew by over 50 percent between 1999
and 2000.32
Argentina produced 23 percent of the global total in 2000, along
with China, South Africa, Mexico, and Uruguay.33
[60] In Kenya, no GM crops have been approved for commercial
planting, though the Kenyan Agricultural Research Institute (KARI)
received government permission in 2001 to field test genetically
modified sweet potatoes that had been developed in cooperation with
Monsanto.34 In
addition, funding from the Novartis Foundation for Sustainable
Development is supporting research KARI is conducting in
partnership with the International Maize and Wheat and Improvement
Center (CIMYYT) to develop disease and insect-resistant varieties
of maize, including Bt maize.35 A similar funding
relationship with the Rockefeller Foundation is supporting research
to develop varieties of maize from a mutant type that is naturally
resistant to a herbicide thatis highly effective against Striga, a
weed that devastates much of Kenya's maize crop each
year.36 Striga
infests approximately 2040 million hectares of farmlandin
sub-Saharan Africa and reduces yields for an estimated 100 million
farmers by 20-80 percent.37
General Concerns about Genetically Modified (GM)
Crops
[61] The relatively sudden and significant growth of GM crops
around the world has raised various social, economic, and
environmental concerns. People in developed and developing
countries are concerned about threats these crops may pose to human
health and the environment. In addition, many fear that large
agribusiness corporations will gain even greater financial control
of agriculture and limit the options of small-scale farmers.
Finally, some are also raising theological questions about the
appropriateness of genetic engineering.
[62] Food Safety and Human Health. Some critics of GM foods in the
United States disagree with the government's stance that
genetically engineered food products are "substantially equivalent"
to foods derived from conventional plant breeding. Whereas
traditional plant breeders attempt to achieve expression of genetic
material within a species, genetic engineering enables researchers
to introduce genetic material from other species, families, or even
kingdoms. Because researchers can move genes from one life form
into any other, critics are concerned about creating novel
organisms that have no evolutionary history. Their concern is that
we do not know whatimpact these new products will have on human
health because they have never existed before.38
[63] Proponents of genetically engineered foods argue that genetic
modification is much more precise and less random than the methods
employed in traditional plant breeding. Whereas most genetically
engineered foods have involved the transfer of one or two genes
into the host, traditional crossbreeding results in the transfer of
thousands of genes. Proponents also note that GM crops have not
been proven to harm human health since they were approved for use
in 1996. Because the United States does not require the labeling of
genetically engineered foods, most consumers are not aware that
more than half of the products on most grocery store shelves are
made, at least in part, from products derived from GM crops. To
date, no serious human health problems have been attributed to GM
crops.39
Critics are not as sanguine about this brief track record and argue
that it is not possible to know the health effects of GM crops
because their related food products are not labeled.
[64] The potential allergenicity of genetically modified foods is
a concern that is shared by both critics and proponents of the
technology. It is possible that new genetic material may carry with
it substances that could trigger serious human allergic reactions.
Proponents, however, are more confident than critics that these
potential allergens can be identified in the testing process. As a
case in point, they note that researchers working for Pioneer Seeds
scuttled a project when they discovered that a genetically
engineered varietyof soybeans carried the gene that produces severe
allergic reactions associated with Brazil nuts.40 Critics, however, point to
the StarLink corn controversy as evidence of how potentially
dangerous products can easily slip into the human food supply.
Federal officials had only allowed StarLink corn to be used as an
animal feed because tests were inconclusive with regard to the
dangers it posed for human consumption. In September 2000, however,
StarLink corn was found first in a popular bran of taco shells and
later in other consumer goods. These findings prompted several
product recalls and cost Aventis, the producer of StarLink, over $1
billion.41
[65] More recently the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food
and Drug Administration levied a $250,000 fine against ProdiGene
Inc. for allowing genetically engineered corn to contaminate
approximately 500,000 bushels of soybeans. ProdiGene had
genetically engineered the corn to produce a protein that serves as
a pig vaccine. When the test crop failed, ProdiGene plowed under
the GM corn and planted food grade soybeans. When ProdiGene
harvested the soybeans federal inspectors discovered that some of
the genetically engineered corn had grown amidst the soybeans.
Under federal law, genetically engineered substances that have not
been approved for human consumption must be removed from the food
chain. The $250,000 fine helped to reimburse the federal government
for the cost of destroying the contaminated soybeans that were
fortunately all contained in a storage facility in Nebraska.
ProdiGenealso was required to post a $1 million bond in order to
pay for any similar problems in the future.42
[66] Another food safety issue involves the use of marker genes
that are resistant to certain antibiotics. The concern is that
these marker genes, which are transferred in almost all successful
genetic engineering projects, may stimulate the appearance of
bacteria resistant to common antibiotics.43 Proponents acknowledge that
concerns exist and are working on ways to either remove the marker
genes from the finished product, or to develop new and harmless
markers. Proponents also acknowledge that it may be necessary to
eliminate the first generation of antibiotic markers through
regulation.44
[67] Finally, critics also claim that genetic engineering may
lower the nutritional quality of some foods. For example, one
variety of GM soybeans has lowerlevels of isoflavones, which
researchers think may protect women from some forms of
cancer.45
Proponents of genetically modified foods, meanwhile, are busy
trumpeting the "second wave" of GM crops that actually increase the
nutritional value of various foods. For example, Swiss researchers
working in collaboration with the Rockefeller Foundation, have
produced "Golden Rice," a genetically engineered rice that is rich
in beta carotene and will help to combat Vitamin A deficiency in
the developing world.
[68] Biosafety and Environmental Harm. Moving from human health to
environmental safety, many critics of GM crops believe that this
use of agricultural biotechnology promotes an industrialized
approach to agriculture that has produced significant ecological
harm. Kelly summarizes these concerns well in the case. Crops that
have been genetically engineered to be resistant to certain types
of herbicide make it possible for farmers to continue to spray
these chemicals on their fields. In addition, GM crops allow
farmers to continue monocropping practices (planting huge tracts of
land in one crop variety), which actually exacerbate pest and
disease problems and diminish biodiversity. Just as widespread and
excessive use of herbicides led to resistant insects, critics argue
that insects eventually will become resistant to the second wave of
herbicides in GM crops. They believe that farmers need to be
turning to a more sustainable form of agriculture that utilizes
fewer chemicals and incorporates strip and inter-cropping
methodologies that diminish crop losses due to pests and
disease.46
[69] Proponents of GM crops are sympathetic to the monocropping
critique and agree that farmers need to adopt more sustainable
approaches to agriculture, but they argue that there is no reason
why GM crops cannot be incorporated in other planting schemes. In
addition, they suggest that biodiversity can be supported through
GM crops that are developed from varieties that thrive in
particular ecological niches. In contrast to the Green Revolution
where hybrids were taken from one part of the world and planted in
another, GM crops can be tailored to indigenous varieties that have
other desirable properties. On the herbicide front, proponents
argue that GM crops make it possible to use less toxic herbicides
than before, thus lowering the risks to consumers. They also point
to ecological benefits of the newest generation of herbicides which
degrade quickly when exposed to sunlight and do not build up in
groundwater.47
Critics, however, dispute these claims and point to evidence that
herbicides are toxic tonon-target species, harm soil fertility, and
also may have adverse effects on human health.48
[70] Just as critics are convinced that insects will develop
resistance to herbicides, so also are they certain that insects
will develop resistance to Bt crops. Terra makes this point in the
case. It is one thing to spray insecticides on crops at various
times during the growing season; it is another thing for insects to
be constantly exposed to Bt since it is expressed through every
cell in the plant, every hour of the day. While the GM crop will
have a devastating impact on most target insects, some will
eventually survive with a resistance to Bt. Proponents acknowledge
that this is a serious concern. As is the case with herbicides,
however, there are different variants of Bt that may continue to be
effective against partially resistant insects. In addition,
proponents note that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency now
requires farmers planting Bt crops to plant refuges of non-Bt crops
so that exposed insects can mate with others that have not been
exposed, thus reducing the growth of Bt-resistant insects. These
refuges should equal 20 percent of the cropped area. Critics argue
that this percentage is too low and that regulations do not
sufficiently stipulate where these refuges should be in relation to
Bt crops.49
[71] Critics are also concerned about the impact Bt could have on
non-target species like helpful insects, birds, and bees. In May
1999, researchers at Cornell University published a study
suggesting that Bt pollen was leading to increased mortality among
monarch butterflies. This research ignited a firestorm of
controversy that prompted further studies by critics and proponents
of GM crops. One of the complicating factors is that an uncommon
variety of Bt corn was used in both the laboratory and field tests.
Produced by Novartis, the pollen from this type was 40-50 times
more potent than other Bt corn varieties, but it represented less
than 2 percent of the Bt corn crop in 2000. When other factors were
taken into account, proponents concluded that monarch butterflies
have a much greater chance of being harmed through the application
of conventional insecticides than they do through exposure to Bt
corn pollen. Critics, however, point to other studies that indicate
Bt can adversely harm beneficial insect predators and compromise
soil fertility.50
[72] Both critics and proponents are concerned about unintended
gene flow between GM crops and related plants in the wild. In many
cases it is possible for genes, including transplanted genes, to be
spread through the normal cross-pollination of plants. Whether
assisted by the wind or pollen-carrying insects,
cross-fertilization could result in the creation of
herbicide-resistant superweeds. Proponents of GM crops acknowledge
that this could happen, but they note that the weed would only be
resistant to one type of herbicide, not the many others that are
available to farmers. As a result, they argue that
herbicide-resistant superweeds could be controlled and eliminated
over a period of time. Critics are also concerned, however, that
undesired gene flow could "contaminate" the genetic integrity of
organic crops or indigenous varieties. This would be devastating to
organic farmers who trade on their guarantee to consumers that
organic produce has not been genetically engineered. Proponents
argue that this legitimate concern could be remedied with
relatively simple regulations or guidelines governing the location
of organic and genetically engineered crops. Similarly, they argue
that care must be taken to avoid the spread of genes into
unmodified varieties of the crop.51
[73] Agribusiness and Economic Justice. Shifting to another arena
of concern, many critics fear that GM crops will further expand the
gap between the rich and the poor in both developed and developing
countries. Clearly the first generation of GM crops has been
profit-driven rather than need-based. Crops that are
herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant have been developed for and
marketed to relatively wealthy, large-scale, industrial
farmers.52 To
date, the benefits from these crops have largely accrued to these
large producers and not to small subsistence farmers or even
consumers. Proponents, however, argue that agricultural
biotechnologies are scale-neutral. Because the technology is in the
seed, expensive and time-consuming inputs are not required. As a
result, small farmers can experience the same benefits as large
farmers. In addition, proponents point to the emerging role public
sector institutions are playing in bringing the benefits of
agricultural biotechnology to developing countries. Partnerships
like those described above between KARI, CIMMYT, and various
governmental and non-governmental funding sources indicate that the
next generation of GM crops should have more direct benefits for
subsistence farmers and consumers in developing nations.
[74] While these partnerships in the public sector are developing,
there is no doubt that major biotech corporations like Monsanto
have grown more powerful as a result of the consolidation that has
taken place in the seed and chemical industries. For example, in
1998, Monsanto purchased DeKalb Genetics Corporation, the second
largest seed corn company in the United States. One year later,
Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn, a major pharmaceutical
conglomerate. A similar merger took place between Dow Chemical
Corporation and Pioneer Seeds.53 The result of this
consolidation is the vertical integration of the seed and chemical
industries. Today, a company like Monsanto not only sells chemical
herbicides; it also sells seed for crops that have been genetically
engineered to be resistant to the herbicide. In addition, Monsanto
requires farmers to sign a contract that prohibits them from
cleaning and storing a portion of their GM crop to use as seed for
the following year. All of these factors lead critics to fear that
the only ones who will benefit from GM crops are rich corporations
and wealthy farmers who can afford to pay these fees. Critics in
developing nations are particularly concerned about the prohibition
against keeping a portion of this year's harvest as seed stock for
the next. They see this as a means of making farmers in developing
nations dependent upon expensive seed they need to purchase from
powerful agribusiness corporations.54
[75] Proponents acknowledge these concerns but claim that there is
nothing about them that is unique to GM crops. Every form of
technology has a price, and that cost will always be easier to bear
if one has a greater measure of wealth. They note, however, that
farmers throughout the United States have seen the financial wisdom
in planting GM crops and they see no reason why farmers in
developing nations would not reach the same conclusion if the
circumstances warrant. Proponents also note that subsistence
farmers in developing nations will increasingly have access to free
or inexpensive GM seed that has been produced through partnerships
in the public sector. They also tend to shrug off the prohibition
regarding seed storage because this practice has been largely
abandoned in developed nations that grow primarily hybrid crop
varieties. Harvested hybrid seed can be stored for later planting,
but it is not as productive as the original seed that was purchased
from a dealer. As farmers invest in mechanized agriculture, GM seed
becomes just another cost variable that has to be considered in the
business called agriculture. Critics, however, bemoan the loss of
family farms that has followed the mechanization of
agriculture.
[76] The seed storage issue reflects broader concerns about the
ownership of genetic material. For example, some developing nations
have accused major biotech corporations of committing genetic
"piracy." They claim that employees of these corporations have
collected genetic material in these countries without permission
and then have ferried them back to laboratories in the United
States and Europe where they have been studied, genetically
modified, and patented. In response to these and other concerns
related to intellectual property rights, an international
Convention on Biological Diversity was negotiated in 1992. The
convention legally guarantees that all nations, including
developing countries, have full legal control of "indigenous
germplasm."55
It also enables developing countries to seek remuneration for
commercial products derived from the nation's genetic resources.
Proponents of GM crops affirm the legal protections that the
convention affords developing nations and note that the development
of GM crops has flourished in the United States because of the
strong legal framework that protects intellectual property rights.
At the same time, proponents acknowledge that the payment of
royalties related to these rights or patents can drive up the cost
of GM crops and thus slow down the speed by which this technology
can come to the assistance of subsistence farmers.56
[77] Theological Concerns. In addition to the economic and legal
issues related to patenting genetic information and owning novel
forms of life, some are also raising theological questions about
genetic engineering. One set of concerns revolves around the
commodification of life. Critics suggest that it is not appropriate
for human beings to assert ownership over living organisms and the
processes of life that God has created. This concern has reached a
fever pitch in recent years during debates surrounding cloning
research and the therapeutic potential of human stem cells derived
from embryonic tissue. For many, the sanctity of human life is at
stake. Fears abound that parents will seek to "design" their
children through genetic modification, or that embryonic tissue
will be used as a "factory" to produce "spare parts."
[78] While this debate has raged primarily in the field of medical
research, some critics of GM crops offer similar arguments. In the
case, Karen gives voice to one of these concerns when she suggests
that we need to stop viewing nature as a machine that can be taken
apart and reassembled in other ways. Ecofeminist philosophers and
theologians argue that such a mechanistic mindset allows human
beings to objectify and, therefore, dominate nature in the same way
that women and slaves have been objectified and oppressed. Some
proponents of genetic engineering acknowledge this danger but argue
that the science and techniques of agricultural biotechnology can
increase respect for nature rather than diminish it. As human
beings learn more about the genetic foundations of life, it becomes
clearer how all forms of life are interconnected. For proponents of
GM crops, agricultural biotechnology is just a neutral means that
can be put to the service of either good or ill ends. Critics,
however, warn that those with power always use technologies to
protect their privilege and increase their control.
[79] Another set of theological concerns revolves around the
argument that genetic engineering is "unnatural" because it
transfers genetic material across species boundaries in ways that
do not occur in nature. Researchers are revealing, however, that
"lower" organisms like bacteria do not have the same genetic
stability as "higher" organisms that have evolved very slowly over
time. In bacteria, change often occurs by the spontaneous transfer
of genes from one bacterium to another of a different
species.57
Thus, specie boundaries may not be as fixed as has been previously
thought. Another example can be found in the Pacific Yew tree that
produces taxol, a chemical that is useful in fighting breast
cancer. Recently, researchers discovered that a fungus that often
grows on Yew trees also produces the chemical. Apparently the
fungus gained this ability through a natural transfer of genes
across species and even genera boundaries from the tree to the
fungus.58
[80] Appeals to "natural" foods also run into problems when closer
scrutiny is brought to bear on the history of modern crops. For
example, the vast majority of the grain that is harvested in the
world is the product of modern hybrids. These hybrid crops consist
of varieties that could not cross-breed without human assistance.
In fact, traditional plant breeders have used a variety of
high-tech means to develop these hybrids, including exposure to
low-level radiation and various chemicals in order to generate
desired mutations. After the desired traits are achieved, cloning
techniques have been utilized to develop the plant material and to
bring the new product to markets. None of this could have occurred
"naturally," if by that one means without human intervention, and
yet the products of this work are growing in virtually every farm
field. Given the long history of human intervention in nature via
agriculture, it is hard to draw a clear line between what
constitutes natural and unnatural food.59
[81] This leads to a third, related area of theological concern:
With what authority, and to what extent, should human beings
intervene in the world that God has made? It is clear from Genesis
2 that Adam, the first human creature, is given the task of tending
and keeping the Garden of Eden which God has created. In addition,
Adam is allowed to name the animals that God has made. Does that
mean that human beings should see their role primarily as passive
stewards or caretakers of God's creation? In Genesis 1, human
beings are created in the image of God (imago dei) and are told to
subdue the earth and have dominion over it. Does this mean that
human beings, like God, are also creators of life and have been
given the intelligence to use this gift wisely in the exercise of
human dominion?
[82] Answers to these two questions hinge on what it means to be
created in the image of God. Some argue that human beings are
substantially like God in the sense that we possess qualities we
ascribe to the divine, like the capacity for rational thought,
moral action, or creative activity. These distinctive features
confer a greater degree of sanctity to human life and set us apart
from other creatures-if not above them. Others argue that creation
in the image of God has less to do with being substantially
different from other forms of life, and more to do with the
relationality of God to creation. In contrast to substantialist
views which often set human beings above other creatures, the
relational conception of being created in the image of God seeks to
set humanity in a proper relationship of service and devotion to
other creatures and to God. Modeled after the patterns of
relationship exemplified in Christ, human relationships to nature
are to be characterized by sacrificial love and earthly
service.60
[83] It is not necessary to choose between one of these two
conceptions of what it means to be created in the image of God, but
it is important to see how they function in current debates
surrounding genetic engineering. Proponents of genetic engineering
draw on the substantialist conception when they describe the
technology as simply an outgrowth of the capacities for
intelligence and creativity with which God has endowed human
beings. At the same time, critics draw upon the same substantialist
tradition to protect the sanctity of human life from genetic
manipulation. More attention, however, needs to be given to the
relevance of the relational tradition to debates surrounding
genetic engineering. Is it possible that human beings could wield
this tool not as a means to garner wealth or wield power over
others, but rather as a means to improve the lives of others? Is it
possible to use genetic engineering to feed the hungry, heal the
sick, and otherwise to redeem a broken world? Certainly many
proponents of genetic engineering in the non-profit sector believe
this very strongly.
[84] Finally, another theological issue related to genetic
engineering has to do with the ignorance of human beings as well as
the power of sin and evil. Many critics of genetic engineering
believe that all sorts of mischief and harm could result from the
misuse of this new and powerful technology. In the medical arena,
some forecast an inevitable slide down a slippery slope into a
moral morass where human dignity is assaulted on all sides. In
agriculture, many fear that human ignorance could produce
catastrophic ecological problems as human beings design and release
into the "wild" novel organisms that have no evolutionary
history.
[85] There is no doubt that human technological inventions have
been used intentionally to perpetrate great evil in the world,
particularly in the last century. It is also abundantly clear that
human foresight has not anticipated enormous problems associated,
for example, with the introduction of exotic species in foreign
lands or the disposal of high-level nuclear waste. The question,
however, is whether human beings can learn from these mistakes and
organize their societies so that these dangers are lessened and
problems are averted. Certainly most democratic societies have been
able to regulate various technologies so that harm has been
minimized and good has been produced. Is there reason to believe
that the same cannot be done with regard to genetic
engineering?
Specific Ethical Questions
[86] Beyond this review of general concerns about GM crops and
genetic engineering are specific ethical questions raised by the
case. These questions are organized around the four ecojustice
norms that have been discussed in this volume.
[87] Sufficiency. At the heart of this case is the growing problem
of hunger in sub-Saharan Africa. It is clear that many people in
this region simply do not have enough to eat. In the case, however,
Kelly suggests that the world produces enough food to provide
everyone with an adequate diet. Is she right?
[88] As noted earlier, studies by the International Food Policy
and Research Institute indicate that the world does produce enough
food to provide everyone in the world with a modest diet. Moreover,
the Institute projects that global food production should keep pace
with population growth between 2000-2020. So, technically, Kelly is
right. Currently, there is enough food for everyone-so long as
people would be satisfied by a simple vegetarian diet with very
little meat consumption. The reality, however, is that meat
consumption is on the rise around the world, particularly among
people in developing nations that have subsisted primarily on
vegetarian diets that often lack protein.61 Thus, while it appears that
a balanced vegetarian diet for all might be possible, and even
desirable from a health standpoint, it is not a very realistic
possibility. In addition, Adam raises a series of persuasive
arguments that further challenge Kelly's claim that food just needs
to be distributed better. At a time when donor nations only supply
1.1 percent of the food in sub-Saharan Africa, it is very
unrealistic to think that existing distribution systems could be
"ramped up" to provide the region with the food it needs.
[89] Does that mean, however, that GM crops represent a "magic
bullet" when it comes to increasing food supplies in the region?
Will GM crops end hunger in sub-Saharan Africa? It is important to
note that neither Adam nor Josephine make this claim in the case;
Kelly does. Instead, Adam argues that GM crops should be part of a
"mix" of agricultural strategies that will be employed to increase
food production and reduce hunger in the region. When stem-borers
and Striga decimate up to 60 percent of the annual maize harvest,
herbicide- and insect-resistant varieties could significantly
increase the food supply. One of the problems not mentioned in the
case, however, is that maize production is also very taxing on
soils. This could be remedied, to some extent, by rotating maize
with nitrogen-fixing, leguminous crops.
[90] In the end, the primary drain on soil fertility is the heavy
pressure which population growth puts on agricultural production.
Until population growth declines to levels similar to those in Asia
or Latin America, food insecurity will persist in sub-Saharan
Africa. One of the keys to achieving this goal is reducing the rate
of infant and child mortality. When so many children die in
childhood due to poor diets, parents continue to have several
children with the hope that some will survive to care for them in
their old age. When more children survive childhood, fertility
rates decline. Thus, one of the keys to reducing population growth
is increasing food security for children. Other keys include
reducing maternal mortality, increasing access to a full range of
reproductive health services including modern means of family
planning, increasing educational and literacy levels, and removing
various cultural and legal barriers that constrain the choices of
women and girl children.
[91] A third question raised by the sufficiency norm has to do with
the dangers GM crops might pose to human health. Does Kenya have
adequate policies and institutions in place to test GM crops and
protect the health of its citizens? The short answer to this
question is no. While the nation does have a rather substantial set
of biosafety regulations, government officials have not developed
similar public health regulations. One of the reasons for this is
because Kenya is still in the research stage and does not yet have
any GM crops growing in its fields. Thus, regulations have not yet
been developed because there are no GM food products available for
consumers. Nevertheless, even when products like GM sweet potatoes
or maize do become available, it is likely that Kenya may still not
develop highly restrictive public health regulations. This is
because the Ministry of Health faces what it perceives to be much
more immediate threats to public health from large-scale outbreaks
of malaria, polio, and HIV-AIDS. The potential allergenicity of GM
crops pales in comparison to the real devastation wrought by these
diseases. In addition, it is likely that officials will continue to
focus on more mundane problems that contaminate food products like
inadequate refrigeration or the unsanitary storage and preparation
of food. 62In
the end, people who are hungry tend to assess food safety risks
differently from those who are well fed. Hassan Adamu, Minister of
Agriculture in Nigeria, summarizes this position well in the
following excerpt from an op-ed piece published in The Washington
We do not want to be denied this technology [agricultural
biotechnology] because of a misguided notion that we do not
understand the dangers and future consequences. We
understand…. that they
have the right to impose their values on us. The harsh reality is
that, without the help of agricultural biotechnology, many will not
live.63
[92] Despite Adamu's passionate plea, other leaders in Africa are
not as supportive of genetically modified crops. During the food
emergency that brought over 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa
to the brink of starvation in 2002, President Levy Mwanawasa of
Zambia rejected a shipment of genetically modified food aid
furnished by the U.N. World Food Programme. Drawing on a report
produced by a team of Zambian scientists, and appealing to the
precautionaryprinciple, Mwanawasa said, "We will rather starve than
give something toxic [to our citizens.]"64 In addition to concerns
about the impact that GM food may have on human health, Mwanawasa
also expressed concern that the GM maize might contaminate Zambia's
local maize production in the future. Given Josephine's ardent
support for agricultural biotechnology in the case, it is important
to note that not all Africans share her confidence about the
benefits of GM crops.
[93] Sustainability. If, however, Kenyans downplay the dangers
posed to human beings by GM crops, how likely is it that the nation
will develop policies and regulatory bodies to address biosafety
and protect the environment?
[94] In fact, Kenya does have serious biosafety policies on the
books. Prompted by the work that Florence Wambugu did on GM sweet
potatoes in collaboration with Monsanto in the early 1990s, these
policies were developed with substantial financial assistance
furnished by the government of the Netherlands, the World Bank, the
U.S. Agency for International Development, and the United Nations
Environment Programme. The Regulations and Guidelines for Biosafety
in Biotechnology in Kenya establish laboratory standards and other
containment safeguards for the handling of genetically modified
organisms. In addition, the regulatory document applies more
rigorous biosafety standards to GM crops than it does to crops that
have not been genetically modified. In general, Kenya's extensive
regulations reflect a very cautious approach to GM
products.65
[95] The problem, however, is that although Kenya has a strong
biosafety policy on paper, the administrative means to implement
and enforce the policy are weak. The National Biosafety Committee
(NBC) was established in 1996 to govern the importation, testing,
and commercial release of genetically modified organisms, but
limited resources have hampered its effectiveness. In 2001, the NBC
employed only one full-time staff person and had to borrow funds to
do its work from Kenya's National Council for Science and
Technology.66
One of the consequences of this inadequate regulatory capacity has
been a delay in conducting field tests on Wambugu's GM sweet
potatoes. Clearly much progress needs to be achieved on this front
before such tests take place on varieties of maize that have been
genetically modified to be insect- or herbicide-resistant. It is
important to note, however, that KARI and CIMMYT are both well
aware of the biosafety dangers related to the development of these
GM crops and are engaged in studies todetermine, for example, the
appropriate size and placement of refuges for Bt varieties of
maize.67
Because much of KARI's work is supported by grants from foreign
donors, necessary biosafety research will be conducted and made
available to the NBC. The problem is that the NBC currently lacks
the resources to make timely decisions after it receives the
data.
[96] Another concern in the case has to do with the ecological
consequences of industrial agriculture. Karen disagrees with Tom's
glowing account of the Green Revolution. While it produced food to
feed more than two billion people during the latter half of the
20th century, it did so only by exacting a heavy ecological
toll.68 It also
had a major impact on the distribution of wealth and income in
developing nations. As a result, Karen is concerned about Tom's
view that GM crops could have a tremendous impact on increasing
food supply in sub-Saharan Africa. Karen fears that GM crops in
Kenya may open the floodgates to industrial agriculture and create
more problems than it solves.
[97] The question, however, is whether this is likely to happen.
With the significant poverty and the small landholdings of the over
70 percent of Kenyans who are subsistence farmers, it is hard to
see how the ecologically damaging practices of the Green Revolution
could have a significant impact in the near future. The cost of
fertilizers, herbicides, or irrigation put these practices out of
reach for most farmers in Kenya. If anything, most of the
ecological degradation of Kenya's agricultural land is due to
intensive cropping and stressed soils. Yield increases from GM
crops might relieve some of this pressure, although much relief is
not likely since food production needs to increase in order to meet
demand.
[98] This raises a third question related to the sustainability
norm. Can organic farming methods achieve the same results as GM
crops? Certainly Kelly believes that this is the case, and there is
some research to support her view. On the Striga front, some
farmers in East Africa have suppressed the weed by planting
leguminous tree crops during the dry season from February to April.
Since Striga is most voracious in fields that have been
consistently planted in maize and thus have depleted soil, the
nitrogen-fixing trees help to replenish the soil in their brief
three months of life before they are pulled up prior to maize
planting. Farmers report reducing Striga infestations by over 90
percent with this method of weed control. A bonus is that
theuprooted, young trees provide a nutritious feed for those
farmers who also have some livestock.69
[99] A similar organic strategy has been employed in Kenya to
combat stem-borers. In this "push-pull" approach, silver leaf
desmodium and molasses grass are grown amidst the maize. These
plants have properties that repel stem-borers toward the edges of
the field where other plants like Napier grass and Sudan grass
attract the bugs and then trap their larvae in sticky substances
produced by the plants. When this method is employed, farmers have
been able to reduce losses to stemborers from 40 percent to less
than 5 percent. In addition, silver leaf desmodium helps to combat
Striga infestation, thus further raising yields.70
[100] Results like these indicate that agroecological methods
associated with organic farming may offer a less expensive and more
sustainable approach to insect and pest control than those achieved
through the expensive development of GM crops and the purchase of
their seed. Agroecology utilizes ecological principles to design
and manage sustainable and resource-conserving agricultural
systems. It draws upon indigenous knowledge and resources to
develop farming strategies that rely on biodiversity and the
synergy among crops, animals, and soils.71 More research in this area
is definitely justified.
[101] It is not clear, however, that agroecological farming
techniques and GM crops need to be viewed as opposing or exclusive
alternatives. Some researchers argue that these organic techniques
are not as effective in different ecological niches in East Africa.
Nor, in some areas, do farmers feel they have the luxury to fallow
their fields during the dry season.72 In these contexts, GM crops
might be able to raise yields where they are desperately needed. It
is also not likely that the seeds for these crops will be very
expensive since they are being produced through research in the
public and non-profit sectors. Still, it is certainly the case that
more serious ecological problems could result from the use of GM
crops in Kenya, and even though donors are currently footing the
bill for most of the research, agricultural biotechnology requires
a more substantial financial investment than agroecological
approaches.
[102] Participation. The source of funding for GM crop research in
Kenya raises an important question related to the participation
norm. Are biotechnology and GM crops being forced on the people of
Kenya?
[103] Given the history of colonialism in Africa, this question is
not unreasonable, but in this case it would not appear warranted.
Kenya's Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) began experimenting
with tissue culture and micropropagation in the 1980s. A few years
later, one of KARI's researchers, Florence Wambugu, was awarded a
three-year post-doctoral fellowship by the U.S. Agency for
International Development to study how sweet potatoes could be
genetically modified to be resistant to feathery mottle virus. Even
though this research was conducted in Monsanto's laboratory
facilities, and the company provided substantial assistance to the
project long after Wambugu's fellowship ended, it is clearly the
case that this groundbreaking work in GM crop research was
initiated by a Kenyan to benefit the people of her
country.73 In
addition, the funding for GM crop research in Kenya has come almost
entirely through public sector institutions rather than private
corporate sources. Even the Novartis funds that support the
insect-resistant maize project are being provided from a foundation
for sustainable development that is legally and financially
separate from the Novartis Corporation. Thus, it does not appear
that transnational biotechnology corporations are manipulating
Kenya, but it is true that the country's openness to biotechnology
and GM crops may open doors to the sale of privately-developed GM
products in the future.
[104] Josephine, however, might turn the colonialism argument
around and apply it to Greenpeace's campaign to ban GM crops.
Specifically, Greenpeace International urges people around the
world to "write to your local and national politicians demanding
that your government ban the growing of genetically engineered
crops in your country."74 Though Josephine does not
pose the question, is this well-intentioned effort to protect the
environment and the health of human beings a form of paternalism or
neocolonialism? Does the Greenpeace campaign exert undue pressure
on the people of Kenya and perhaps provoke a lack of confidence in
Kenyan authorities, or does it merely urge Kenyans to use the
democratic powers at their disposal to express their concerns? It
is not clear how these questions should be answered, but the
participation norm requires reflection about them.
[105] The concern about paternalism also arises with regard to a
set of questions about appropriate technology. Are GM crops an
"appropriate" agricultural technology for the people of Kenya?
Genetic engineering and other forms of agricultural biotechnology
are very sophisticated and expensive. Is such a "high-tech"
approach to agriculture "appropriate" given the status of a
developing nation like Kenya? Is it realistic to expect that
undereducated and impoverished subsistence farmers will have the
capacities and the resources to properly manage GM crops, for
example through the appropriate use of refuges?
[106] In the case, Josephine responds aggressively to concerns
like these when she overhears Terra's conversation with Tom. She
asserts that Kenya will do what it takes to educate farmers about
the proper use of GM crops, and it is true that KARI is designing
farmer-training strategies as a part of the insect-resistant maize
project.75
Compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya has very
high rates of adult literacy. In 2000, 89 percent of men and 76
percent of women were literate. At the same time, only 26 percent
of boys and 22 percent of girls are enrolled in secondary
education.76
Thus, while literacy is high, the level of education is low. The
hunger and poverty among many Kenyans, however, may be the most
significant impediment to the responsible use of GM crops. In a
situation where hunger is on the rise, how likely is it that
subsistence farmers will plant 20 percent of their fields in non-Bt
maize if they see that the Bt varieties are producing substantially
higher yields?
[107] This is a fair question. The norm of participation supports
people making decisions that affect their lives, but in this case
the immediate threat of hunger and malnutrition may limit the range
of their choices. At the same time, GM crops have the potential to
significantly reduce the amount of time that women and children
spend weeding, picking bugs off of plants, and scaring birds away.
Organic farming methods would require even larger investments of
time. This is time children could use to attend more school or that
women could use to increase their literacy or to engage in other
activities that might increase family income and confer a slightly
greater degree of security and independence. Aspects of the
participation norm cut both ways.
[108] Solidarity. Among other things, the ecojustice norm of
solidarity is concerned about the equitable distribution of the
burdens and benefits associated with GM crops. If problems emerge
in Kenya, who will bear the costs? If GM crops are finally approved
for planting, who will receive most of the benefits?
[109] Thus far, critics argue that the benefits of GM crops in
developed nations have accrued only to biotech corporations through
higher sales and to large-scale farmers through lower production
costs. Moreover, critics claim that the dangers GM crops pose to
human health and biosafety are dumped on consumers who do not fully
understand the risks associated with GM crops and the food products
that are derived from them. It is not clear that the same could be
said for the production of GM crops in Kenya where these crops are
being developed through partnerships in the non-profit and public
sectors. Researchers expect to make these products available at
little cost to farmers and few corporations will earn much money
off the sale of these seeds. Thus, the benefits from GM crops
should accrue to a larger percentage of people in Kenya because 70
percent of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture.
Like developed nations, however, food safety problems could affect
all consumers and a case could be made that this would be more
severe in a nation like Kenya where it would be very difficult to
adequately label GM crop products that often move directly from the
field to the dinner table.
[110] Another aspect of solidarity involves supporting others in
their struggles. Josephine does not explicitly appeal to this norm
in the case, but some members of the Hunger Concerns group are
probably wondering whether they should just support Josephine's
proposal as a way to show respect to her and to the
self-determination of the Kenyan people. There is much to commend
this stance and, ultimately, it might be ethically preferable. One
of the dangers, however, is that Josephine's colleagues may squelch
their moral qualms and simply "pass the buck" ethically to the
Kenyans. Karen seems close to making this decision, despite her
serious social, ecological, and theological concerns about GM
crops. Friendship requires support and respect, but it also thrives
on honesty.
Conclusion
[111] Tom and Karen face a difficult choice, as do the other
members of the Hunger Concerns group. Next week they will have to
decide if the group should join the Greenpeace campaign to ban GM
crops or whether it wants to submit an article for the campus
newspaper supporting the responsible use of GM crops to bolster
food security in Kenya. While convenient, skipping the meeting
would just dodge the ethical issues at stake. As students consider
these alternatives and others, the goods associated with solidarity
need to be put into dialogue with the harms to ecological
sustainability and human health that could result from the
development of GM crops in Kenya. Similarly, these potential harms
also need to be weighed against the real harms that are the result
of an insufficient food supply. The problem of hunger in
sub-Saharan Africa is only getting worse, not better.

after the prestigious scientific journal, Nature, published a study
by scientists claiming that gene flow had occurred between GM maize
and indigenous varieties of maize in Mexico. Since Mexico is the
birthplace of maize, this study ignited alarm and produced a
backlash against GM crops. In the spring of 2002, however, Nature
announced that it should not have published the study because the
study's methodology was flawed. See Carol Kaesuk Yoon, "Journal

54 Opposition reached a fevered pitch when the Delta and
Pine Land Company announced that they had developed a "technology
protection system" that would render seeds sterile. The company
pointed out that this would end concerns about the creation of
superweeds through undesired gene flow, but opponents dubbed the
technology as "the terminator" and viewed it as a diabolical means
to make farmers entirely dependent on seed companies for their most
valuable input, seed. When Monsanto considered purchasing Delta and
Pine Land in 1999, Monsanto bowed to public pressure and declared
that it would not market the new seed technology if it acquired the
company. In the end, it did not. See Bill Lambrecht, Dinner at the

In the latest twist in the never-ending legal battle between Kaleidescape and the DVD CCA, Kaleidescape CEO Michael Malcolm tells CE Pro (Electronic House’s sister publication) that the California 6th District Court of Appeal has granted a temporary stay of the injunction handed down by Judge William J. Monahan earlier in March 2012.
This means the injunction that would have forced Kaleidescape to stop selling its DVD movie servers will not come into effect on April 8, 2012 as previously ordered, according to Malcolm.
“The injunction will not come into effect while the Court of Appeal decides on our petition that the injunction be stayed during the appeal process,” Malcolm says. “If Kaleidescape’s petition is not granted, the injunction could come into effect later in April or in May.”
After the injunction was handed down, Malcolm sent a memo to dealers and said the injunction might never take effect, unless the Court of Appeal affirms Judge Monahan’s ruling. Malcolm also assured dealers the injunction “will in no way enjoin our dealers” as they act independently and outside of Kaleidescape.
In a flash survey by CE Pro, 23 percent of respondents said they don’t care about how the courts rule in DVD-ripping cases, noting that the future is Blu-ray and Kaleidescape is perfectly legal in that regard.

It’s been over two years since the foundations went in for the extension we’re building on our house. In that time I’ve come to respect and somewhat rely on glib phrases such as “Good things come to those who wait” and “Patience is a virtue”. I told my better half we’d be moved in by Christmas, I didn’t say which one though. In this blog series of the time I used FloVENT to simulate the beneficial thermal effects of the layer of sub-floor expanded foam insulation that UK building regulations insist on. There’s not much point in insulation unless you’ve added some heat to keep inside. Being located in quite a rural location we’re not on the gas mains, we haven’t got an oil tank to power a boiler so the only heating options are wall mounted electric storage heaters or underfloor electric heating mats. I’m not a big fan of wearing socks inside and I don’t like cold feet. I opted for the latter.
Electric heaters, whether wall mounted or buried under the floor, rely on the concept of Joule (or ohmic or resistive) heating to turn electric current flow into heat. Whilst electronics cooling is the challenge faced by thermal engineers helping design electronic products, or products with electronics in, electronics heating is the friend of those of us who live in more temperature climates.
The cost of installing wall mounted electric storage heaters compared to underfloor electric heating mats is surprisingly similar. The main difference in operation being the power density (and resulting local temperature) of the heat source. The wall mounted heater is quite small and gets quite hot, in that respect operating in a similar way to a wall mounted hot water radiator heating system though with a much higher thermal mass and subsequent inability to cool down or heat up quickly. The underfloor electric heating mats are spread over the entire floor area and warm the floor up slightly.
The heating mats come rolled up with the electric heating element already taped to a mesh to ensure that when laid out, the element is equally distributed on the floor.
Once taped to the floor you put a layer of adhesive over the top (unless you’re brave enough to lay the tiles directly on top), let that dry then lay the floor tiles as usual. The installation instructions indicate that you should do a resistance check at all stages of the installation. They didn’t say what you should do if the resistance goes up massively (due to damage or fracture of the wire) after the tiles are down. The inference was I think to run screaming outside with your hands flailing above your head prior to phoning professional installers to rip out your attempt and to do the job for you properly.
Thermal simulation of such an application lies somewhere between what FloTHERM and FloVENT was designed to do. The former having the ability to simulate Joule heating, including the temperature dependent effects of the electrical resistivity of the wire. The latter having the ability to predict specific aspects of the resulting human comfort such a comfort temperature, PMV, PPD etc. Let’s just say I used FloTHENT.
From a qualitative perspective you can clearly see the effects of the hot wires and how the heat diffuses down into the concrete screed. But hey, qualitative, shmalitative, who’s interested in pretty pictures? For an accurate simulation it’s critical to ensure the correct boundary conditions are defined for the heating element itself. More on that next time.

And "a year away from championship quality," according to Todd Blackledge (PSU Alum and CF Analyst) on ESPN's PTI today. Do you agree or disagree?
Before the year began, I'd say (objectively speaking) that Michigan or Michigan State had better all around talent. After the first 3 weeks, I'd have to say that I agree with Mr. Blackledge to some extent, we're on par with Michigan at the top of the conference imo. I personally feel we're currently only a slightly above average team overall though, and probably closer to two years away from championship quality, as opposed to one. What do you guys think?
"OSU: Most Talented Team in the B1G"
And "a year away from championship quality," according to Todd Blackledge (PSU Alum and CF Analyst) on ESPN's PTI today. Do you agree or disagree?
I think they are probably the most talented team, but I disagree that they are a year from a Championship. Urban's guys will still be young, and big impact players like Marshall will only be freshman. I think 2014 is the year they win it all, or are a serious contender that could take on the likes of Bama or LSU. All the immensely talented guys on D will be Jr's and sophomores, Braxton will be a senior, the playmakers like Marshall will have a year under their belts. I say 2013 will be a great year, but 2014 is the title run.
Msu and scum if you combined their best players and made a team are not as talented top to bottom as TOSU... Combine that fact with UFM as our coach and Blackledge is right...
"GIMMIE THAT BEAT FOOL!!! IT A FULL TIME JACK MOVE" Ice Cube jack for beats..
I like Blackledge a lot (even though he played @ Penn State) and I respect his opinion. I think he's correct on the talent @ OSU being best in the conference. I also think by next year we can certainly compete for a national title.
Agree on all fronts. Michigan's defensive talent is still average, and MSU's offensive talent is inferior.
vacuuming sucks
I believe that Ohio State will be "championship quality" next year, but there might be 6-8 teams going into a season that fit that category.
Often, it comes down to breaks, injuries, etc.
Other times, there will be a powerhouse team (or two) that can blast its way through all potential obstacles (e.g., Miami FL in 2001 and, we thought, 2002). As long as there isn't one of those teams next year, and things break right, the Buckeyes might have a puncher's chance next year in spite of youth.
The rest of this season, Spring and Preseason camp, this offense will be championship caliber barring major injuries next season. Braxton doesn't lose any of his wideouts and Hyde, Dunn, Smith all get more experience. The line will be good-very good.
Now for the defense. Well, the offense will be championship caliber.
vacuuming sucks
^Based on what I've seen in recruiting, I think we'll have a Top 5 defense in two year's time. Next year though, you're right, could be a crapshoot. Will likely be a transitional year as guys like Spence, Washington and Shutt try to replace Simon, Williams, Goebel (and Hankins if he leaves after this year).
We do have the most talent, however the thing working against us is that the other teams players are perfectly molded into their systems. In other words we have the best talent but not necessarily the type of player that is needed for each position in the spread offense. For example, a lot of msu's players wouldn't play for osu, however all of there players are pretty good fits for the offense that they run. Going forward particularly into next year and the coming years Michigan should be some real competition but that will probably be about it. In closing, we have the most talent but not even close to the best fit for our players. Also our defense has to improve leaps and bounds if we are to be in national title talk, it probably has to be actually much better than the tressel defenses.
It's destiny. It's just what he does. 2nd year at Utah - unbeaten. 2nd year at Florida - national title. And he has more talent on this team than he did with either of those other 2.
I honestly think Nebraska is the most talented in the B1G this year.
I can't disagree with that. We should by all means have the best team, we kill the B1G in the recruiting trail. Plus we're not Georgia we don't coach down our 4-5* players!!!
Wherever you are, there you be!
Buckeyes14- I respect your opinion but would love to hear your reasoning. They have the advantage at RB for sure and probably OL. Otherwise I don't see where they have more talent, especially with their defensive losses. If anything we might be even overall, but I'd still take OSU's cast any day.
From a talent perspective, OSU is the only team in the B1G who has players that are\will\can end up on award watch lists.
By my amateur estimation, I see the following possible. (Note, this is guys in the running, not anything anyone will end up winning)
Braxton Miller-Maxwell, Heisman, O'Brien, Unitas and Camp
John Simon-Outland and Lombardi
Jonathan Hankins-Outland, Nagurski and Lombardi
Ryan Shazier-Bednarik, Nagurski, Butkus
Bradley Roby-Bednarik, Nagurski, Thorpe.
Now, I don't think any of those names will win any of those awards this year but I wouldn't be shocked if their names crept up on the semi finalist lists at some point, at least for a few of them. I do think Roby will win a Thorpe before its all said and done and Miller will absolutley be your Heisman front runner next year. Shazier has to get the details of the game down but he might want to make a new shelf in his house pretty soon.
OSU is an immensley talented football team. They are actually winning games on talent alone so far as they have a tenuous grasp on the defense and a loose, yet slowly tightening, grasp on the offense. Not many teams in the B1G can say they are winning on talent alone. When these guys all blend the cocktail that is talent and superior coaching, the B1G as a whole and much of the nation at large is in for a very long and painfull curb stomping at the hands of OSU.
4-6 seconds from point A to point B and when you get to point B, be pissed off
Year two could be interesting. The players coming back know what to expect from the coaches in the off season, the competition will heat up for playing time in (spring ball), more talented hungry freshman that's ready to contribute, and coaches ready to roll instead of explaining every little detail. I say we will have a team who knows itself and a team ready to go all out! We may win it all or come close.
Jford
OSU is going to be a top 5 team next season. They'll lose Simon, Sabino, Stoney, Hall, potentially Hankins but all 5 of those guys have their replacements loaded. To be honest, Schutt and Washington has the potential to be a terrifying DT combo with Spence coming off the edge (in addition the rest of the ends OSU is lining up!). Perkins should fill in nicely next season. Dunn and Hyde will be a devastating RB combo. Vannet doesn't have Stoney's versatility but it appears to have the tools to be a very good TE in his own right.
Next year is really going to bug the anti OSU crowd out there...
4-6 seconds from point A to point B and when you get to point B, be pissed off
Unless they improve drastically, not a chance they are championship caliber team. They come out struggling versus teams they should be beating by 2-3 scores at the half. I'll go on record saying I don't think Meyer wins a National Title here.
Run_Fido's favorite word is strawman.
Meanwhile Sparty is losing to directional Michigan late in the 2nd.
Its official, THE BIG TEN IS CURSED!
Run_Fido's favorite word is strawman.
I think we're the best team in the B1G, but let's be honest--it's like being the slimmest person at an Overeater's Anonymous meeting!
First, B1G is horrible...so is this really a compliment? I guess it's all how you look at it and presently I don't look at it as a good thing. We're mediocre and that's not too much to be happy about, but 4-0 is. Hopefully Tue and Wed practices will be enough time to repair all that's broken before 3:30 next Saturday in order to go 5-0. I see Bell getting about 50 carries...why not...OSU's defense hasn't stopped a good RB yet. Not sure 5-0 will be attainable for this team...guess we'll see.
"There's nothing that cleanses your soul like getting the hell kicked out of you."
"I love football. I think it is most wonderful game in world and I despise to lose."
Woody Hayes 1913 - 1987
All I have to say is that Tressel was 7-5 in year 1 and then 14-0 national champions in year 2. Also Meyer's second year at a school has always been better than year 1.

Just want to throw a question out to there on the 09 Z28's.
I've struggled w/ torque issues on my GT. Tried torqueless grips and still have a minor issue.
Is the 09 Z28 any different in the grip area? I heard that it's made
a little fatter at the riser.
Info and thoughts please???

Out with the girly and in with the glam.
When is a fashion show more than a fashion show—when is it a work of art? Marc Jacobs is no stranger to spectacle, but with his NYFW-closing show on Thursday, he elevated the typical show format to a museum-worthy plane. In so doing, he didn’t just delight his audience; he dazzled us. Literally.
Guests arrived at the Lexington Avenue Armoury and entered a show space that was less a set, more a solarscape. A massive ‘sun’ cast an artificial glow over a round, moon-like runway. It was just like Olafur Eliasson’s mock sun from The Weather project, the 2003 Tate Modern installation that had urbanites queuing up to bask in manmade rays through the grayest winter months.
This sun threw a golden-brown light over the catwalk, temporarily obliterating colour perception. When the first model took to the catwalk, we could see shapes and textures, but few fabric details—and no colour at all. Reflective pyjamas, wide-sleeved coats, cheek-baring hot pants, boxy jackets, sequinned dresses and big shaggy furs all took turns.
Every few exits, it looked like a model meandered out from backstage having forgotten to put on the other half of her outfit. Cara Delevingne, almost unrecognisable in her Joan Jett wig, wore a cable-knit sweater and goggly-eyed faux fox stole. Another model made her lunar orbit wearing only a pair of high-waisted hot pants and heels, holding a gloved hand across her chest for a nod to the idea of coverage.
After the entire cast walked, the lighting changed—and they did it again. The natural light by now suffusing the show space revealed unperceived riches of hue. Sequinned shirtdresses flowed over the body in sapphires, rubies and rose quartz tones. The paillette-covered coats and cropped jackets of the finale weren’t just sparkly; they glittered in colour. Bias-cut gowns flowed over the body in precious-metal tones. It was out with the girly and in with the glam.
Jacobs hasn’t enjoyed the easiest of seasons. First Hurricane Sandy devastated his home, to which he apparently has yet to return; then Winter Storm Nemo interrupted work on his collection and forced him to delay his Marc Jacobs and Marc by Marc Jacobs shows. He told WWD that the idea of ‘comfort’ and a reassuring beauty underpinned this collection.
Leaving aside its contemplative basis, one thing about this collection was clear. Sofia Coppola expressed it best as she made her way backstage: ‘I can’t wait to go shopping,’ she said. Something tells us that next season, just about everyone will be ready to let the sun shine in.

Library $50,000 restored, will we notice?
Council restores library budget cuts
The Brookfield's Common
Council last night restored $50,000 in the Brookfield Public Library
budget as part of its approval of the city's 2009 executive budget.
The council approved the budget, which calls for a $34.3 million tax levy, an increase over $33 million in 2009. The overall budget is $73.4 million, a decrease from 2008's $77.1 million.
With the addition of the library funds, the tax rate will be $5.29 per $1,000 of assessed value, meaning the owner of a $335,000 home would pay $1,772 in city taxes.
Two other proposals to reduce the budget - taking $25,000 from the Police Department's DARE program and further reducing fuel budgets - made no headway on the council floor, Finance Director Robert Scott said.
Council to have budget hearing tonightThe city of Brookfield will hold a public hearing on the city's 2009 budget at 7:45 p.m. today at City Hall, 2000 N. Calhoun Road.
The city's overall budget for 2009 is proposed at $73.4 million, a decrease from the 2008 budget of $77.1 million. The tax levy would increase 3.64 percent, going from $33 million in 2008 to $34.2 million in 2009.
The tax rate would be $5.29 per $1,000 of assessed value, meaning the owner of a $335,000 home would pay $1,772 in city taxes, an increase of $47 from 2008.

Elsevier’s “Article of the Future” is now available for all Cell Press Journals
Cell readers can experience the first four issues of 2010 for free
Amsterdam, 7 January 2010 – Elsevier, the leading publisher of scientific, technical and medical information products and services, today announced that all research articles in its flagship collection of Cell Press journals will be published online in the new ‘Article of the Future’ format on. Previously released as a demonstration prototype for two sample articles, the “Article of the Future” is an ongoing collaboration with the scientific community to redefine how scientific articles are presented online. Successful ideas from this project are planned to be rolled-out across Elsevier’s portfolio of 2,000 journals available on ScienceDirect, the world’s largest scientific, technical and medical database.
“By taking advantage of the functionalities afforded by online publishing, our new article format provides authors and readers with more effective and efficient ways to present and access scientific information” said Emilie Marcus, Editor in Chief, Cell Press. “We’ll continue to solicit and incorporate user feedback in developing improvements to the format with the continuing goal of helping to advance scientific research.
In celebration of the launch and to encourage user feedback, Article of the Future articles are accessible for free for Cell Press’ flagship title, Cell, on, for the first four issues of 2010.
The ‘Article of the Future’ reflects a new approach to structuring the traditional sections of a research article, moving away from the linear format required by print presentation to an integrated, linked navigation scheme that allows each reader to create a personalized path through the article’s content. For example, one of the key features of ‘Article of the Future’ functionality is a tabbed navigation structure through the Introduction, Results, Figures and Discussion sections, providing experts with in-depth coverage of a particular experiment, while allowing more general readers to absorb the main message without being overwhelmed by additional details.
Readers will also experience a graphical abstract and a highlights section on the landing page of each article, complimenting the abstract text by creating a quickly reviewable visual summary and bullet points. In addition, articles will offer the article’s text, a figure and a figure caption at the same time on one screen, with a zooming capability to discover the finer details of a figure. Selected articles take advantage of integrated multimedia by featuring PaperFlicks, a video tour of an article’s content.
Elsevier’s Content Innovation Initiative
The functional roll-out of these Article-of-the-Future features at Cell Press is part of Elsevier’s larger Content Innovation initiative. This initiative aims at improving the formal scientific communication in a scalable way, and includes efforts to enhance the presentation of the current scientific article (like the Article of the Future), but also projects to better connect this article with the larger body of scientific knowledge on the web.
“The new capabilities in online publishing allow us to move forward from a one-size-fits-all approach to online formats tailored to specific subject domains.” remarked IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg, Vice President of Content Innovation for Elsevier Science & Technology Journal Publishing. “Content Innovation is thus also about observing the life-scientist, the mathematician, and the chemist and adding relevant domain-specific value to their workflows. And the reactions on our Article-of-the-Future features and on the Reflect pilot demonstrate that we are on the right track here.”

Crossmarks
One of the challenges researchers face is a lack of clarity around whether they are consulting the most up-to-date version of an article or research.
Despite even the most careful scrutiny during the publishing process, corrections, updates and errata, as well as retractions and withdrawals, are sometimes still necessary. The challenge is that many versions of the article may still exist out on the web.
To combat this problem, Elsevier and other to navigate to the most recent version available.
Elsevier and.
We are aiming to roll this service out to 1,250 of our 2,000 journals by the end of 2012 and eventually to all Elsevier titles.We are aiming to roll this service out to 1,250 of our 2,000 journals by the end of 2012 and eventually to all Elsevier titles.
Often, copies of documents are posted on a variety of sites which can make it more difficult for the publisher to notify readers when a correction or other change materially affects the interpretation of the work. CrossMark can help with that communication.
Egbert van Wezenbeek, Director Publication Process Development, has been responsible for leading the CrossMark project at Elsevier. He commented: “The launch of CrossMark offers a significant benefit to researchers. Not only does it create a standard across scholarly publishing for recognizing changes, it can also highlight important publication record information. This can include publication history, the location of supplementary data, access policies, funding sources, peer review processes and other useful information.” Find out more about the Elsevier Policy on CrossMark.

Sahil Malik has a response to my SharePoint 2010 Sandbox Solutions are Bad post that you can read here: Sandbox solutions are pretty damn good.
He also links to a Facebook conversation wherein Razi Bin Rai asserts "At heart of the argument of 'SB solutions are bad', there is actually more of a resistance against new way of doing things" and Sahil replies "True True Razi".
Not true at all. (I am always amazed when an Internet commenter thinks they know the mind of another from a tweet or a page of text).
There is in fact not a resistance against a new way of doing things. I came to this new technology with a great deal of excitement, but I find it distinctly lacking in its merits.
With regards to Sahil's post - I believe that proxies are a sound and vital architectural choice. But they are not part of the sandbox even though SharePoint provides the means to invoke a specific type of proxy from the sandbox. In SharePoint they are, in fact, full trust components that require administrative access to install. My guess is that those who have permission to use them will do so if they are using Silverlight or heavy javascript with the new client namespace. Furthermore, they will use some form of server side proxies regardless of whatever deployment (sandbox or farm) choices they make.
And why not? By going with a predominately client side technology you don't lose anything from the sandbox that you would have without it. Assuming you have admin access you can solve both issues #2 and #3 mentioned in my original post . But let us be completely honest about what this means; you solve them by having components outside the sandbox. Most, I think, would choose this architecture (proxies to server side services) when the UI is client side JavaScript or Silverlight with or without the sandbox. If we both agree that this is a sound architecture in and of itself, let's not confuse the subject of the merits of the sandbox as it is implemented by talking about something that is clearly separate even though complimentary.
Besides, I don't think full trust proxies will be an option on SharePoint Online or other hosted offerings anyway.
Sahil seems to be conflating my choice of the word 'Bad' with 'useless'. This is not a useless technology, but it is a bad one. As you may know, I've been slowly making Elumenotion into an ISV. I hope to have some success with SharePoint Online and its analogs and so we are working on a variety of workarounds and trying to come up with a serviceable architecture. The fact is: there are workarounds and you can build solutions.
This concession made, let me reiterate what I think was the most important part of the original post. If you are going to do development on 2010 and you have access to the server your default choice should be farm solutions unless you have a compelling requirement to do otherwise – the pronouncements at PDC and elsewhere to the contrary (sandbox should be your default choice) are nonsense. Absent a clear requirement (like the need to run as a hosted solution) going with a sandbox will result is more code with strange workarounds and potentially less secure data for more money and time. If that's not bad, then what is it?
I must admit that I was a little irked that I took the time to come up with three specific examples that Sahil ignored and substituted with a straw man when he wrote his rebuttal. I think I have addressed the full trust proxy point, but let me tackle a couple of his other points so that he need not be irked with me. ;)
First Sahil says 'Farm solutions and custom code is the number one necessary evil on SharePoint projects. It is also the number one issue that causes problems and updates. And it is also the number one issue that causes contention between IT Pros and developers.' To this I can only say '[citation needed]'. It's a huge assertion to make that does not jibe with my experiences or anecdotes from my peers or clients.
Second is that the sandbox provides a degree of monitoring that can prevent rogue apps from killing the server. I agree that this is a great thing especially if you are providing hosted services like SharePoint Online that preclude normal QA and monitoring processes for deployed code. Once again though, if you have the option of traditional development because you own the servers, traditional QA and WMI instrumentation along with ULS logging are a first line defense which should minimize the need for such a system.
Third Sahil says: 'My feeling is that there's been plenty of thought given to where and how those walls have been drawn.' My feeling is that insufficient thought and resources went into making these decisions. At some point they have to ship it and they decided where to put the resources. This stuff smacks of a version 1.0, let's get it out the door deal. I am spending a lot of time in Reflector these days looking at the SharePoint assemblies. If there is a security or performance issue that caused them to deny access to the entire SharePoint.WebControls namespace I do not see it. The code for most of these controls is simple and straightforward. However, there are hundreds of them. My purely speculative guess is that they only had so much manpower to go around and they took the easy way out by blocking them all instead of looking at them individually.

Time to party!
The house of horror? Certainly not... this is the place where it all started: the Quartier Latin aka Axel in Kaldenkirchen.
And this is what Linde had to offer. Brewed by Dutch monks just over the border... a true divine intervention.
Not to forget this one. As well as three other nice beers that I forgot to take pictures of. Choices, choices.
The kids, however, didn't care about all this and enjoyed the evening with one table soccer game after the other.
And this is Jenny in action. She's playing Ruben's tried and trusted Rhodes 73 - a heavenly combination.
Elmar is signing the 5th anniversary 'guest book'. A combination of best wishes and wild jokes, as you can imagine ;-)
...which also led to a change of drinks. Here come the shots - better search cover.
Lutz aka Luke the Bear in a cheerful temper, like always. Meet the man behind the "Evil Evening" events.
And here we have Ruben's parents! Thanks a lot for five years of secret laboratory asylum in the basement.
And then came Tom VDH aka elysia France. Boy, the man can play. Usually, I mean ;-)
Like every good party this one ended with burning the place down to the ground.
Time flies when you're having fun. Fun we had in huge loads, so the flight has been supersonic so far. We're looking forward to the next five years!
Unbelievable. Yet true: On January 18th our small but famous pro audio company became already 5 years old. We started a little party on the 17th...
Our good friend and one of the hosts of the evening: Linde! Already in the right place for action...
And this one, of course. Wrong glass, but right content, as always. Never judge a beer by its cover.
Outside, however, Paul was taking care about the really nasty stuff. See the stop sign in the background?
Ruben is just announcing the star of the evening: Jenny. No anniversary without live music, and Jenny rocked!
In the meantime, Jimi was watching over us. He's been doing this for so many years, he can't be shocked anymore.
Halftime! Time to welcome Pepe as the new bartender, as Linde was tired of tapping and wanted to party, too.
And yes, this did have its consequences. Jacqueline and Frank impressively demonstrate what I'm talking about.
Here's Andre together with Ruben. They still look pretty fit, don't they? On the surface, hehe...
Jotto and Ruben couldn't let the chance pass to surprise everyone with an impromptu birthday duo. Oh my.
The winning combination: Fire, food and funny hats. And fun, fun, fun, of course.
On the next day, everybody was looking something like this. The answering machine saved the day.

If movie-to-TV serialisations brings back edgy memories of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, the next few years could set that record straight. Hollywood has gone gaga for small-screen adaptations and is promising - or in one or two cases, threatening - to repackage some of our favourite movies in TV-shaped bites. Read on for all the full low-down on an intriguing development slate...
Stage: Pilot script
How would it work? Agent Coulson: The series. Except without Phil, because he’s (probably, though we live in hope) an ex-Agent after Loki speared him like so much cubed barbecue meat.
What to say about it: As part of Joss Whedon’s deal to oversee Marvel’s Phase Two output (and make The Avengers sequel), he’ll co-write and possibly direct the pilot for ABC with regular collaborators Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen and Jeffrey Bell, with Marvel’s Jeph Loeb also involved.
Not likely to be featured? The Hulk, who is getting his own show in development under the aegis of Guillermo del Toro.
Possible casting: Item 47 star and Thor / Avengers SHIELD man Agent Sitwell, played by Maximiliano Hernández could be a prime candidate.
Possible tagline: “Saving the world. On a budget.”

Things move quickly when you own your own studio and write/direct/ produce/star in your films. Tyler Perry announced his latest project, Single Moms Club, back in October. Since the, Bridesmaids’ Wendy McLendon-Covey has signed on and now Perry has locked in the rest of the cast, with Terry Crews, Nia Long, Amy Smart, Eddie Cibrian, William Levy, Zulay Henaco and Ryan Eggold all on for roles.
Not much has been announced about the film’s plot, though we do know it focuses on a group of single mothers (with that title? Who’d guess?) from different walks of life who must band together after an incident at their kids’ school.
While we’re pretty sure the incident will either be a problem teacher or possibly a death during a particularly tough game of dodgeball, we’ll all have to wait and see what actually happens. Perry has just kicked off shooting the movie.
Perry, who will next be seen acting in Alex Cross on November 30, already has one other film headed for cinemas. Temptation: Confessions Of A Marriage Counselor hits US screens on March 29 but doesn’t have a set date for the UK yet.

The Standard gives pride of place to yesterday's decision by the National Security Council to send army units to Samburu County to help police pursue bandits who killed at least 42 officers in a weekend ambush.
In a separate story, the Nairobi-based daily says national outrage continues to rise over the casual manner in which the State has handled the killings, particularly leaving the bodies of dead officers to rot in trucks outside a primary school for four days after the massacre. President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday commissioned a new commuter train service in Nairobi but though prayers were said for the police officers killed, he did not mention them in his speech.
Yesterday, two missing officers were rescued in the Suguta Valley. A number of policemen are still unaccounted for.
According to sister paper, the Daily Nation, the trouble began on 20 October, when Turkana warriors raided their Samburu neighbours and stole more than 500 cattle and goats. The Samburu struck in a revenge attack and drove away 297 camels.
The government responded by sending a contingent of the paramilitary General Service Unit, regular and Administration Police officers, who were ambushed, resulting in the weekend massacre.
Police have meanwhile arrested a local civic leader in connection with the attacks.
The Nachola ward councillor was taken into custody on suspicion that he and another man, also a civic official, incited the Samburu and Turkana communities to fight one another for unknown reasons.
The Standard also reports that the International Criminal Court has started pushing more countries to sign the Rome Statute and to renew cooperation that would see arrest warrants enforced.
Representatives of ICC member states are meeting in The Hague today to take part in a review conference.
Today's talks will centre on a plan of action aimed at achieving full universality of the statute, which created the court in July 2002 to try crimes of concern to the international community.
Several countries, including the United States, Russia, China and India are yet to recognise the ICC, slowing the court’s ability to exercise criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes.
Suspects indicted by the court like Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir and Joseph Kony of the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda, are yet to be arrested, a situation ICC officials blame on non-cooperation by some member states.
Thirty-three out of the current 121 members are African countries.
In Uganda, former State minister for Health Mike Mukula yesterday told the Anti-Corruption Court that first lady Janet Kataha Museveni asked for and her office to be given the shilling equivalent of 16,000 euros of funds meant for the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation programme.
Mukula is himself charged with stealing about 63,000 euros from the same programme.
The main story in the Johannesburg-based business paper, BusinessDay, says South Africa’s platinum production has fallen to an 11-year low, pushing the global market into a deficit as strikes, safety stoppages and mine closures cut production from the world’s largest supplier, Amplats.
Anglo American Platinum lost at least 170,000oz of platinum during a recent eight-week strike and is still struggling to convince workers to return to their posts.
The global supply of platinum, which includes output from mines in Russia, north America and Zimbabwe, is at the lowest level since the year 2000.

Bread and Circuses
Taking into account the interesting times we live in, it’s not been a bad year, mainly because the government has provided bread and circuses, as governments do when times get interesting.
Even for a curmudgeon like me, the circuses were enjoyable. First off, Hammersmith had a happy time in June when it celebrated Queen Elizabeth’s diamond jubilee, the sixtieth anniversary of her accession to the throne.?

LOS ANGELES (CN) - Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors wants voters to decide in November whether porn actors should be required to wear condoms to make their movies.
The Board of Supervisors voted 3-1 this week to put the "condoms in porn" initiative on the November ballot.
It would require pornography producers in the county to get a health permit from the county's Department of Public Health to make pornographic movies.
Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky, Don Knabe and Michael Antonovich voted Yes: to send the question to voters. Supervisor Gloria Molina was the only supervisor to vote No. Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas abstained.
The law is meant to protect sex performers from AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. And, presumably, set a good example for people who watch pornography.
The president of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has sought mandatory condom use in pornography for years, called the commission's vote "a great day for the performers and safer sex in our society," in an interview with the Los Angeles Time.
Last December, the City of Los Angeles suedfive registered voters who proposed the initiative, including AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein, claiming the measure was pre-empted by state law.
But the Los Angeles City Council later approved a condom ordinance in January this year.
The United States' multibillion-dollar porn industry is concentrated in Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. Porn producers have threatened to pack up and leave the state if actors are required to wear condoms.
The industry claims that monthly check-ups for sexually transmitted diseases protect actors.
But in August 2011, the industry shut down after a performer tested positive for HIV, according to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.
The foundation backed the measure, along with more than 370,000 Los Angeles County residents who signed a petition to have it put on the ballot.
AIDS Healthcare Foundation senior director of public health Whitney Engeran-Cordova told Courthouse News that the group was "very pleased" that the county had "followed the lead of 371,000" people who wanted the issue placed on the ballot.
"I believe the people of Los Angeles believe that workers should be protected from getting sick on the job," Engeran-Cordova said. She said that requiring porn actors to wear condoms was no different than asking a worker to "wear a hard hat on construction site."
"This is not a matter of consensual sex. This is a job," she said.
Diane Duke, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition, said the supervisors had put the measure on the ballot because "they really had no other choice."
"What was made abundantly clear at the meeting, through the written statement by the L.A. County's public health director, is that the cost of implementing the program will be astronomical for the county as well as adult producers," Duke wrote in an email to Courthouse News.
"AHF representatives argued in favor of the measures based on workplace safety issues which only supports Supervisor Molina's argument - this issue does not fall under county jurisdiction but at the state level with CalOSHA [California Department of Industrial Relations]."
But apparently, voters will decide. Some county officials said that enforcing the rule might be difficult.

Gulf scene investigation: oil analysis (5:56)
Gulf scene investigation: oil analysis (5:56)
Since the Deepwater BP oil spill in April 2010, scientists have been collecting thousands of plant, animal, soil, and water samples to determine how the oil has impacted the Gulf's natural resources. After collection in the field, the samples get shipped to labs around the country for analysis. In this video, we'll go inside the lab to get a better understanding of how samples are analyzed, what scientists are looking for, and what happens to the data. While scientists are working hard to analyze many types of samples for a variety of reasons--seafood safety, for example--the samples being analyzed in this video will help inform the Natural Resource Damage Assessment--the process that determines how an oil spill affects the environment and ensures the responsible parties pay for restoration.

Talk about a beautiful way to begin! Take a gander at the recently released music video for upcoming NBC series Smash, featuring Katharine McPhee's version of Christina Aguilera's hit "Beautiful."
On top of McPhee's shimmering rendition of the song, the video also includes sneak peeks of the series, which is a backstage look at a Broadway musical about Marilyn Monroe.
So is the former Idol star cast as the idol herself?
REALTED: Nick Jonas and Bernadette Peters Coming to NBC's Smash
Kinda sorta maybe. McPhee plays Karen Cartwright, a young girl from Iowa with a dream of making it on Broadway who walks in to audition for the role of Marilyn and blows everyone away. Anjelica Huston, Megan Hilty, Christian Borle, and Debra Messing round out the cast.
Smash premieres February 6th on NBC. In a word: Gorgeous.
(Trick! You thought we'd say beautiful, right?)

Shonda Rhimes is one step closer to owning ABC.
The Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice creator just shared some good news with her Twitter followers: her freshman political drama Scandal has been picked up for second season by ABC.
Yay for more fast-talking, scandalous goodness from Kerry Washington & Co.! So what did Rhimes have to say about the news? And what did she share about one of her other fan favorite shows? Plus, what decision did ABC make about GCB?
MORE: CW Renews Gossip Girl For Sixth Season, But Will it Be the Last?
"Am super proud to say that @ScandalABC has been picked up for a 2nd season!! Am doing a little dance of joy. Still waiting to hear on PP...," Rhimes tweeted. (In case you aren't in the know, PP stands for Private Practice. Duh-doy!)
The political soap, which centers on professional crisis "fixer" Olivia Pope (Washington), who has a special relationship with the President of the United States (no big deal!), garnered 6.5 million viewers and a 2.0 rating in the demo in its most recent episode. Scandal finishes its seven-episode first season Thursday, May 17.
Everything's bigger in Texas...except GCB's chances at a second season as sources confirm to us that the Leslie Bibb and Kristin Chenoweth-led dramedy series, which is kind of like Desperate Housewives' sassy Sotuerh cousin, has been canceled by ABC.
ABC recently renewed Happy Endings, Revenge, Castle, Modern Family, Once Upon a Time, The Middle and Rhimes' O.G. show Grey's.

Nicki Minaj didn't join American Idol expecting to feud with one of her idols.
But, she admitted today on Good Morning America, being true to who she is has been known to "ruffle other women's feathers."
Mariah Carey's included.
Nicki flashes a nip on BET
"She's been one of my favorite artists of all time since I can remember, so it's weird that everything kind of, was blown up like that. It didn't make me happy at all," Minaj said of the verbal exchange she had with Carey over the summer that resulted in a flurry of stories about discord—and heightened security—on the Idol set.
"I can't take away what she's done in my life and just in pop culture in general and just having one of the most amazing voices in the world," Minaj continued. "Having said that, I'm an adult and we are passionate on the set and sometimes when you're a passionate woman, you know, sometimes it kind of ruffles other women's feathers, but I'm going to continue to be Nicki Minaj."
Producers had their judges' backs throughout in the meantime, and the panel has remained intact as the 12th-season premiere of American Idol approaches.
Nicki raps about "being quick to check a bitch"
"I would consider myself an honest judge," said the 29-year-old, who was decked out in head-to-toe pink two days after being named Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the American Music Awards. "That's all I'm doing. I've said before, I want them to leave with the truth. I feel like the truth has always fueled me to get better."
Talking about her duet with Justin Bieber on "Beauty and the Beat" at the AMAs, she called the experience "interesting."
"I was surprised when they asked me to perform with him...Of course, I was like, 'I can't turn that down!' The song had just come out, everybody loves the song, so I was like, 'It'll be a good thing, I guess.'"
5 biggest jaw-droppers at the American Music Awards
"I love it, I was just looking at the little body grind," Minaj laughed, mimicking the motion from the replay on the screen in front of her. "We never really rehearsed it together, everything was just so quick, and I had rehearsals the day before, so I had to go and try on outfits and stuff like that. So when I got up there with him, I kinda thought, 'OK, let's make sure everything works and I get my cue and I walk out on time."
And the body grind synced up perfectly!

Renée Zellweger and Kenny Chesney are once again "single persons."
Paperwork finalizing and formalizing the end of the duo's blink-and-you-missed-it marriage was filed Tuesday in Los Angeles.
"The judgment of nullity is entered," the documents read, per TV's Extra. "The parties are declared to be single persons."
Zellweger, 36, and Chesney, 37, met in January, wed in May, and split in September when the Oscar-winning actress filed for an annulment from her country superstar spouse.
If, given its brevity, it seems as if the Zellweger-Chesney union never existed, then the approval of the annulment guarantees that it never did exist. As far as the law is concerned, it was all just a bad Pam Ewing dream.
The couple's uncoupling raised eyebrows not just for its speed--it came a little more than four months after their Virgin Islands ceremony--but for its declaration of "fraud."
In seeking to null and void the marriage, Zellweger checked the box marked "fraud." The Bridget Jones' Diary star explained she did not mean to impugn Chesney's character--she was merely going with the best of a batch of bad options. Other boxes on the request form would have accused one or both of them of bigamy, or even of being of "unsound mind."
For his part, Chesney seemed to take no offense to the word "fraud." He told ABC's The View last month that he and Zellweger still "really care about each other."
The caring, though, wasn't enough to keep the newlyweds together, or even in near proximity. Chesney resumed his Somewhere in the Sun tour shortly after the wedding. From that point on, he and Zellweger were rarely seen out and about as a couple.
Zellweger and Chesney were both first-timers at marriage. They had no children.
Since going their separate ways for good, both have found the going a bit rough. Zellweger saw the rerelease of her summer flop, Cinderella Man, reflop. Chesney saw Keith Urban steal his thunder--and his Entertainer of the Year title--at the Country Music Association Awards.
Still, Chesney's new album, The Road and the Radio, released in November, has been a hot seller--it's fifth in the latest Nielsen SoundScan rankings. And Zellweger's lined up to star in the Tom Cruise-produced Japanese horror remake, The Eye.

Kudos again to Casey over at Modern Hiker. His vivid descriptions and photos of local hiking destinations have provided the inspiration for many of the hikes I’ve taken this past year. And with a special page of “Best Hikes in Los Angeles“, how could he make it any easier?
So his rave reviews of the Mishe Mokwa Trail to Sandstone Peak earned it a place on my list of must-do hikes. Columbus Day provided a day off and therefore the perfect opportunity to check it off the list and explore some wonderful scenery at the same time. Joined by friends A & P, we set out from Hollywood shortly after 8AM and after a bit of traffic on the 101 Freeway, we exited at Westlake Blvd. Within a few short miles were in the winding-road wilderness of the Santa Monica Mountains.
It takes a while to drive to the trailhead, but we easily found the parking lot off of Little Sycamore Canyon. We were the only car in the lot as we set off on the trail. I’ll leave the description to Casey, but it’s just as he described – to a “T”. I can see why he’s a fan of this hike – it’s a well-marked trail that takes you through some varied terrain in a short distance, and offers some phenomenal views around just about every corner. One especially nice aspect of it is that you barely notice the elevation gain as you do most of the hike around to the peak. And then once you’ve ascended it, it’s all downhill back to the car.
As we exited the car, I was immediately aware of the stillness all around. At times when the birds were silent, it was hard to hear anything else – a rarity in the urban sprawl of LA. We saw several interesting sights, including Balanced Rock, and Split Rock. The lone picnic table at Split Rock is in the perfect secluded location for a longer break, but after playing on the rocks, we continued on.
The weather was gray, but it made for a comfortable temperature as we hiked. We didn’t take the spur trails to Tri-Peaks or Inspiration Point; those will have to wait for another day. But we turned off to climb to the top of Sandstone Peak (Mount Allen) and were afforded amazing 360-degree views of the ocean and Conejo Valley. It was at that time that I vowed to come back on a clear day in the upcoming winter months to do the hike prior to sunset (as suggested by another helpful trail blogger). The trail back down to the car is pretty wide and clear and shouldn’t be a problem at dusk with a good headlamp.
All in all, we did a leisurely 6 miles and a 1400 feet climb. A perfect way to enjoy a day off with friends.

What WTO means for working families
by John Burbank and Robert E. Scott
This week, Seattle is ground zero in the battle for control of the global economy. Labor unions, environmentalists and citizen-action groups are in the streets to protest proposals to expand the unilateral decision-making power of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The participants in WTO’s forum must begin to address the imbalance between multinational corporate power and the economic security of families across the nation and here in Washington.
The restructuring of the world economy highlights the fact that between 1980 and 1996, the volume of world trade nearly tripled, and foreign direct investment in low- and middle-income countries increased more than fivefold, according to the World Bank. With the advent of new technologies, falling transportation and communication costs, and recent WTO rulings, international trade and investment will continue to accelerate in the future. Indeed, the WTO acts as the legal arbitrator to encourage the unimpeded flow of capital to maximize profit for global corporations.
Globalization has contributed to the creation of vast new sources of wealth in companies like Microsoft and Boeing, which have been critical to the growth of Washington’s economy. However, multinational companies have also moved thousands of factories out of our country. As a result, millions of high-wage manufacturing jobs have been lost in the U.S. in the past two decades.
The WTO encourages the movement of capital around the world, regardless of the social costs and long-term economic implications. Our own experiences in the early days of this century show that an unregulated market is a tremendous threat to economic stability and prosperity. But the WTO enables private capital to avoid and legally undermine national and state-level labor, environmental and social policy, just when these policies are needed to ensure that the developing global economy results in rising living standards for all workers and communities.
Our political leaders must balance the elimination of trade barriers with the rights of citizens to fundamental environmental and worker standards.
Here in Seattle this summer, Vice President Al Gore acknowledged that “when it comes to trade, labor rights and environmental protection are not second-class issues any longer” and that we need to include “labor and environmental protections in those agreements.”
These issues should be our top priority in all future trade negotiations, and especially in the WTO. We must hold this administration to its word here in Seattle.
But the effects of trade on our communities cannot be solved through international agreements alone. In the face of the increasing dominance and mobility of corporate capital, nations and states need to build community capital — that is, universally shared policies for which all citizens pay and from which all citizens benefit — to ensure a basic level of economic security and quality of life for our citizens.
In building community capital in the context of the global marketplace, we need the following:
- Easily accessible and affordable worker training, re-training, and education. One result of the movement of corporate capital is that individual workers are left more and more on their own. We must give workers the tools to maintain their earning ability even while moving from job to job and company to company.
- Systems to make sure workers and their families have health-care coverage, including when they are caught between jobs or in job-training programs.
- Quality child care for our children that enables their teachers to earn livable wages and commit themselves to this work, while making it possible for parents to maintain their productive roles in our economy.
- Paid family leave so that we can care for our families and excel as productive workers, that is, so we can balance work and family.
- Reinforcement of our systems for Medicare, Social Security, pensions, and other retirement necessities, and universalized systems for pension portability.
Public policy can fill in the gaps corporate capital creates when companies move overseas or simply cut benefits for their work force. Capital may be global and mobile, but, as citizens and family and community members, we aren’t. So we need to build our countervailing community capital.
The creation and enjoyment of wealth cannot be a monopoly for powerful corporations who step around the citizens of our democracy. Our job is to tune up the engine of wealth creation by developing our own social and community capital, to make sure we can maintain and enhance the economic security of
Washington state families.

Sizemore also isn't cowardly persay, he just doesn't want to kill. He was more than prepared to face Jetstone and die, it was DOING killing that upset him.
But they had those things allllll along.
Also am I the only one who has this odd image of Olive dropping the hippie as she grows out of the 60s and becoming a yuppie on wallstreet all corporate ponytail chopped off? Anyone?
Edit: As for the whole natural counters thing, I would imagine turnamancy would be the best counter to Uncroaked, aside from any kind of healing if that works here on uncroaked. Causing those zombies to skip their turn or get stalled, means the entire stack loses strength for the eventual engagement.
Also I don't think there would ever be a natural counter to decryption unless it was another tool of the titans. I mean if one mancy could counter an entire army without upkeep cost that can feed its own ranks? That would have come up before. Frag. The. Mage.

Last night @BayerJeff, @DawnTaylor666, @travisezell, and several others were whooped at poker, possibly by me.
Watch @jamesrocchi interview the COP OUT stars, especially the final question and reaction. Yee-ikes.
Our two new wide releases this weekend are both surprises, one good and one bad.
“Cop Out,” the first film to be directed by Kevin Smith without also being written by him, is the bad one. It’s a surprise because the trailers were pretty funny, and Smith has made some really good comedies before. I mean, not in a while, but he has done it. Just not this time.
But “The Crazies” (review at Film.com) — a horror film that’s a remake and has no big stars in it — turns out to be surprisingly tense, scary, and fun, the way movies about viral outbreaks that destroy towns ought to be. Good for “The Crazies”!
We also have reviews of three Oscar contenders playing in limited release. “Ajami” and “A Prophet” (reviews at Cinematical), from Israel and France, respectively, are both nominated in the foreign-language category. Coincidentally, both also have to do with the drug-fueled world of organized crime, particularly its effects on young people. Also coincidentally, they’re both very good.
The other Oscar film is “The Messenger,” (review at Film.com) nominated for its screenplay and for Woody Harrelson’s supporting performance. He and Ben Foster play Army officers given the duty of going to people’s houses and telling them their son or daughter or husband has just been killed in Iraq. So yeah, it’s pretty hilarious.

RT @JohnnySLC @EricDSnider I wonder what all of those surprised library patrons now think of Alec Baldwin.
I’m not crazy, right? My brother Chris really does look like Alec Baldwin. Around the nose and mouth especially.
@FatboyRoberts Believe me, there is nothing funnier to him (or our dad) than a fart, even an embarrassing one. NOTHING.
You’ll want to read my brother’s simple yet elegant blog post about a fart in a library. Trust me.

Each Apache child does the following: 1. sits and waits for a connection to come in; 2. when a connection comes in, one of the children awakes, 3. reads data from the connection, 4. creates a response and sends it back, 5. closes the connection, and 6. goes back to waiting. Presumably in steps 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, the web server is blocked waiting for the networking code to resume it. In step 4, it might do a number of things. For example, it might spawn off a CGI script belonging to a user, or it might read from a file belonging to a user. In this case, the web server doesn't trust the CGI script (or possibly even the parts of the filesystem belonging to users); if it takes too long to return, the web server will want to send an error to the client so the client doesn't think your web server is poorly administered. Worse, all your web server processes will eventually end up hung; eventually you won't be able to start any more. Assuming that the filesystem's interface is designed under the assumption that filesystem domains will be invoked with call, not send or return, how would you handle this? Can you do a send and make it look like a call? You could spawn a little domain that would accept your call and the resume key, hand the resume key to another domain that will invoke it after a timeout, and then do the filesystem or CGI call you wanted in the first place. (Is there a better way to handle this?) > >Maybe it's premature to be worrying about stuff like this when the OS > >doesn't run Emacs yet. > > This kind of trust is so basic, I think you have to consider it from the > very beginning. I think you are right; that was why I bothered to post. (I was thinking about the lack of software interrupts, like Unix signals, which are (a) impossible to emulate efficiently by any other means and (b) relatively easy to add to the kernel later if people think they're a good idea. Obviously the KeyKOS people don't; Windows NT people didn't, either, which is why interrupting a Windows NT process stuck in a compute loop causes dialog boxes to pop up and then kills the process without notifying it. There is much to be said for the idea that signals enabled Unix programs to get away with all kinds of brain-damage, though. . .) -- <kragen@pobox.com> Kragen Sitaker <> The Internet stock bubble didn't burst on 1999-11-08.

A passion for teaching is necessary for anyone entering the teaching profession, but nowhere is this more evident than when one’s career goal is that of teaching special needs children. While dealing with their diagnosed special needs, whether they are physical, mental, or emotional is rewarding, it takes a certain “something” that only a few people possess. For this reasons, those who pursue degrees, especially in early childhood education, where so many of these children first enter the academic setting, are highly sought.
It is these people whose passion and emotion for teaching must far exceed that of other teachers. Fortunately, in the majority of cases, these teachers rise to the occasion in ways we may not be able to fathom.
Sometimes a person may be studying for an early childhood education degree and through some opportunity — perhaps a student teaching assignment or a substitute teaching job during one’s free time—this person discovers that she has that passion for teaching required to teach special needs children. For this person, the option of taking online courses through such resources as elearners.com can help them make this a realization.
This can be especially true if a person is nearing the last eighteen months to one year of college. This revelation may come at this time, since this is when many people begin to participate in actual classroom settings, and the concern that the courses covered so far may not be sufficient to meet this challenge may surface.
However, by utilizing resources such as elearners.com, one can receive the education needed to succeed in this calling (for this indeed is what it very well may be), because the courses that will prepare them for the many emotional challenges that come with teaching special needs children will be available. This is in addition to others that a person may feel necessary in order to pursue this rewarding but very different career path.

Tankless water heaters
February 25, 2010
On the brink of their 15 year anniversary comes
Takagi’s
most revolutionary tankless water heater ever. Installers will love Takagi’s newest model, the T-H2, because it is a high efficiency condensing tankless water heater with features designed specifically to make life so much easier for them.
With the T-H2, installers can finally vent with PVC instead of stainless steel. PVC venting provides zero clearance so it is easier to install, and it is less expensive compared to stainless steel so it will help reduce some of the installation costs passed onto the customer. The T-H2 will work with four inch PVC pipes.
The T-H2 will also feature a front panel LED screen that displays temperature settings and codes. This built-in digital readout will provide for easier maintenance and troubleshooting. Installers will not have to use dipswitches because they can finally see what temperature is actually being inputted. The digital display will also come with up and down buttons so users can choose from among 16 different temperatures ranging from 100° to 185°. Takagi is the first manufacturer to have the temperature readout built into the unit’s computer board and displayed on the front panel of the heater so that it can be easily read without ever taking the cover off or using a remote.
“The versatility with this unit is unparalleled,” says Takagi’s General Manager Koji Matsumura. “Everything you can possibly need or want in a light commercial/heavy residential unit is found in the T-H2. You have efficiency, power, reliability, endless hot water, energy savings, a long life span, heavy duty components to ensure its durability and an installation that is straightforward and trouble-free. Not to mention the additional savings you gain with PVC venting alone. The T-H2 is Takagi at its best.”
Following in the footsteps of its older brother, the T-H1, the T-H2 is expected to possess an extremely high thermal efficiency of 92%, which would make it the second highest efficient unit in Takagi’s line-up. It will also have a low activating flow rate of 0.5 gpm and a maximum flow rate of 9 gpm. However, unlike its big brother, up to four T-H2’s may be easily linked together without the need for an additional control box, thus providing for even larger applications.
Keeping in line with Takagi’s exceedingly high quality standards for all its commercial units, the primary heat exchanger on Takagi’s T-H2 is made with the most advanced copper alloy on the market, HRS35, which is now a signature trademark for all of Takagi’s commercial units. Its secondary heat exchanger, which handles the condensing portion of the unit, is made with #316L stainless steel, which is one of the highest quality grades of stainless steel available.
Because the T-H2 may be used with PVC venting, Takagi also incorporated two safety measures to control exhaust overheat and prevent temperatures from melting the PVC. These measures are in addition to the standard safety features found with all Takagi tankless water heaters.
The new unit also offers three settings for higher altitude locations ranging from as low as 2,500 ft to as high as 10,000 ft above sea level. The T-H2 is ideal for light commercial and heavy residential water heating, space heating, radiant floor heating, in-direct heating, re-circulation and combination heating systems.

Sony has finally released details on the rumoured Sony mash-up brawler. Titled PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, the all-in beat-em up fest is currently in development by SuperBot Entertainment.
So far, the following characters have been revealed as playable characters on the fighting roster:
- Kratos (God of War)
- Sweet Tooth (Twisted Metal)
- PaRappa (PaRappa the Rapper)
- Sly (Sly Cooper)
- Radec (Killzone)
- Fat Princess (Fat Princess)
Gameplay is much like the Super Smash Bros. series pitting multiple players against each other. Each character will have three level “Super” moves. A filled gauge will deliver knock out attacks whereas lower level special attacks won’t be nearly as effective, but will be easier to charge when wanting to launch an early assault.
.”
PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale offers different gaming modes including single and multiplayer, as well as a tournament mode for online play.
No release date available at the moment but with E3 fast approaching, expect to see more on the title in the coming months ahead. For now, take a look at the first, of what will hopefully be many trailers for PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale:

Cape San Juan Observatory (CPR, 18° 23' N, 65° 37' W), located in the Caribbean region on the island of Puerto Rico, is supported by the NOAA ESRL Global Monitoring Division, is part of the NASA's AErosol RObotic NETwork (), and is one of the contributing stations to the Global Atmosphere Watch (). Physical and radiative properties of atmospheric particles have been measured since 2005 at CPR. Here we present an overview of the results for year 2007. Three types of air masses predominated in this study, (1) those of marine origin or “clean” (C), (2) those bringing African Dust (AD), and (3) those with the influence of volcanic ash (VA) from the Soufriere Hills in the island of Montserrat. Preliminary results show that the average values for the total σsp (Fig. 1) were higher for AD (83 Mm-1) and VA (34 Mm-1) compared to C (17 Mm-1). The same happened for the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) maximum values at 500 nm with 0.92, 0.30, and 0.06 for AD, VA, and C, respectively. The observed increase in the values of the Angstrom exponent (å) (Fig. 2) is indicative of a decrease in the size of the particles associated to VA (å= 0.27) and AD (å =0.89) when compared to C (å =0.24). The volume size distributions and thus the mass were dominated by the coarse mode (> 1.0 µm) especially for the AD case. Results have shown that AD as well as VA has a significant impact on the physical and radiative properties across Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. Additional discussions together with results on the AOT wavelength dependence and on the annual variability of the properties under study will be presented.

: Biological Sciences (School of)Essex credit: 15ECTS credit: 7.5Available to year(s) of study: Available to Study Abroad / Exchange Students: No Pre-requisites: BS221 OR BS222
Bioinformatics has evolved in recent years as a distinct discipline within the Biological Sciences to address the complexity of experimental data generated in the post-genomics era. The sheer volume of high-throughput data based on DNA sequence, RNA/gene expression and protein structure has necessitated the development of computational approaches for i) accessing and navigating database repositories and ii) analysing large datasets in order to obtain biologically-meaningful information (data-mining). These activities have traditionally been the realm of computational biologists, particularly in the development of computer software. However, as Bioinformatics becomes increasingly important in most areas of modern biology, there is a pressing need for biologists who do not have a computational/mathematical background to be able to understand and use the vast range of internet and software resources that are now available.
In addressing a recognised skills gap and in order to equip students from a Biomolecular background with valuable theoretical and practical skills, the Bioinformatics (BS312) module provides a broad-based curriculum that encompasses both traditional genomics together with RNA microarray and protein analysis methodologies. The emphasis of the module is on problem-based-learning; each topic is introduced by a lecture followed by a supervised session in the PC laboratory in which students follow detailed instructions that allow them to work through example datasets in order to understand and learn how to use and interpret commonly used methods. The sessions are supported by extensive documentation with guidance on further student-directed learning. No programming skills (computer language) are required; computational operations are all essentially 'point-and-click' and will use open-source software. Students will then be able to enhance their skills in their own private study.
Learning outcomes:
To pass this module, students will need to be able to:
1. be competent in the use of general on-line utilities such as NCBI;
2. search intuitively for internet Bioinformatics resources including databases;
3. understand the principles and practical applications of commonly-used DNA sequence analysis algorithms;
4. demonstrate the ability to process and analyse gene expression microarray data downloaded from database repositories;
5. demonstrate competence in the use of different in silico methods for protein structure-function analysis;
6. demonstrate competence in pathway and network analysis methods;
7. have a good appreciation of the statistical methodologies upon which different Bioinformatics algorithms are based.
9 x 3hr sessions (27 hrs total); each session comprised of 1hr lecture, followed by 2hr supervised PC class
4 sessions covering general utilities and DNA methods in weeks 2-5
5 sessions covering microarray and protein methods in weeks 7-11
(one session per week except for 'gap week' in week 6 when students complete coursework 1)
Student managed learning: 123 hrs
Total: 150 hrs
100 per cent Coursework Mark
Coursework:Coursework 1 (covering DNA methods) weighted 40% (40 hrs in total)
Coursework 2 (covering RNA & protein methods) weighted 60% (60 hrs in total)
Other details:Both coursework elements will involve DAI including assessment of understanding of methodology; to be submitted in SPF.

New SOS Bus to arrive in November
6:20pm Thursday 27th September 2012 in News
COLCHESTER’S new SOS Bus is set to be rolled out in the town in November.
The new vehicle will hit the streets in the middle of the month, aiming to help more people then ever.
A former Essex Libraries bus, the new vehicle will bear little resemblance to the recognisable yellow base in High Street on Friday and Saturday nights.
Wayne Powell, chief executive of Open Road, which runs the service, said: “We are really excited about the new bus.
“It is going to be really different to the current bus.
“Being a former library bus, it is not something we have been used to converting and it has been a difficult process.
“It will be very different to what people have been used to seeing in the High Street.”

Pa Hockey – Pennsylvania Hockey History Restoration Project
The Pa Hockey Foundation is beginning a lifetime project in 2013 to rebuild the History of Hockey in the State of Pennsylvania and bringing this project to the Internet including Pictures, Videos, Periodicals and Stories of Pennsylvania Hockey from 1969 to the present. The Pennsylvania High School Hockey Championships have crowned 99 Pennsylvania State Champions at the Class AAA, Class AA and Class A levels since 1975 and began in Erie, Pennsylvania at the Glenwood Rink. Pa Hockey Hub will begin to compile the history of the Pennsylvania High School Hockey Championships to the Pa Hockey Hub and Pa Hockey History Hub Websites in unprecedented fashion with the Championship Teams, the Stories including the journey of the development, the championships runs and the moment captured with Video Footage, Press Articles, Pictures and most importantly the stories before, during and after those championships.
The beginning of this project will begin additional projects including the first games in Eastern Pennsylvania in 1969 and Western Pennsylvania in 1971, the Leagues and their Championships, the Pacesetter Players, Coaches and Programs, All-Time Records and Milestones and begin many Reunions of Championship Teams, Players, Coaches and Families.
The project has begun with a Facebook Page called Champions Gate - Pennsylvania Hockey Champions and I have begun to compile pictures of the Pennsylvania High School Hockey Champions from 1975 thru the present. Out of the 99 Pennsylvania High School Hockey Champions, I have uploaded pictures from 2000 to the present and now I am attempting to bridge the gap from 1975 to 2000, with the Archives I have collected plus elicit help from anyone who has pictures of these State Championship Teams.
Send me any pictures, articles and videos you may have collected to Pa Hockey Foundation PO Box 10598, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15235 or jeffmauro@aol.com.

Important Information re Youth Hockey Structure
To: Western PA Youth Hockey Leaders:
This information is being sent to club/team Presidents. Please forward on to other interested officers/individuals.
Confusion has surrounded our sport since June of this year as a result of the USA Hockey rule change regarding the age ranges allowed to play ‘high school hockey.’ We are working to continue expanding opportunities for children to play hockey and feel that it is important for us to provide our thoughts on restructuring the youth hockey system in our region – based off of the latest rules. We have met with key stakeholders from the PAHL and PIHL, their member clubs and facilities which led us to create the structure presented in the following document. Our plan seems to provide a clear career path with opportunities for players regardless of ability, interest level and financial commitment to play the game.
We believe that by making the changes mentioned in our presentation the player development model will be enhanced, the career path for players will be clearly defined and ice at the facilities will be utilized more efficiently.
We realize that these are significant modifications that will require a collaborative effort between all of the key stakeholders, and that there will be challenges along the way. The Penguins welcome these challenges, as well as additional ideas, and hope that you will too. After all, we share the common goals of increasing participation and improving the overall structure of the sport. In the end, it is about providing the best development opportunities for our athletes.

Liberty-Eylau tops Gorman to win tourney
Liberty-Eylau doesn’t have the depth to run its full-court pressure for four quarters, so coach Robert Cochran picks his moments.
After trailing at halftime, Cochran unleashed his team on Bishop Gorman.
The result was a tide-changing quarter in which the Lady Crusaders turned the ball over on their first six possessions and the Lady Leopards capitalized en route to a 69-55 victory in the final of the Macy Chenevert Patriot Holiday Tournament on Saturday at UT Tyler’s Herrington Patriot Center.
Gorman (17-3) turned the ball over 10 times in the third quarter, more than the other three quarters combined (nine). Liberty-Eylau (14-3) scored 16 straight points to start the second half to take a 44-32 lead midway through the quarter and take control.
“We normally pressure the entire game from the word go; we’re not deep enough to do that right now,” Cochran said. “We didn’t press much in the first half at all, trying to save ourselves for the second half; that was our game plan going in.
“We played well in spurts in the first half but I thought the entire second half we probably played our best basketball game and that’s the way we’re going to have to play to get where we want to go. That’s probably our best 16 minutes of basketball that we’ve played probably in a couple years.”
The Lady Crusaders lost 72-61 to the Lady Leopards on Nov. 27 in a game L-E used its press early and held on late. After the Lady Leopards blitz at the start of the second half Saturday, Gorman never closed the gap to fewer than eight points.
“It just killed us,” TKG coach Katie Robertson said of the press. “It’s what happened to us the last time we played them but in the first quarter.”
Future Division I players Imani Wright (Baylor) and Sharde Collins (Arkansas-Little Rock) led the way for the Lady Leopards. Wright had game-highs of 28 points, six steals and two blocks in addition to six boards and two assists.
Collins finished with 19 points and eight rebounds while slowing down Goman’s Division II-bound Michelle Obach.
“Sharde’s, if not the best, one of the best defensive players I’ve coached,” Cochran said. “She takes it as a challenge and … what she did in the second half on (Obach) … really allowed our pressure to take over.”
Obach still finished with a team-high 22 points, 10 coming in the fourth quarter as she tried to will the Lady Crusaders back into the game.
“We’ve played the quote-unquote six or seven Division I guards and she’s by far the best,” Cochran said. “We played in the Metroplex and we played in Shreveport. She’s the best individual guard with respects to the high school game. She’s just a great basketball player.”
Brooke Lee added 12 points, four steals and three assists for the Lady Crusaders before fouling out with 2:23 to play. Danielle Smith chipped in nine points and 10 rebounds.
Obach and Susannah Williams (nine points, seven rebounds) were named to the All-Tournament team from Gorman along with Wright, Collins and Liberty-Eylau’s Lauren Godfrey (eight rebounds).
Gorman trailed by seven entering the second quarter but scored nine straight over 1:43 late in the period to go into halftime ahead 32-28.
After the break, things unraveled quickly for the Lady Crusaders. Wright opened with a jumper, then snagged a steal that led to a layup to tie the game. A minute later Morgan Utsey converted on a TKG turnover to give Liberty-Eylau the lead for good. Wright scored 12 points before Obach drove to the basket for two for Gorman’s first points of the second half.
“Their personnel, they just have so much size over us,” Robertson said. “Mentally we got out of the game a little bit; maybe we just got a little too confident with what we did in the second quarter.”
“It humbles us and makes us realize how much harder we have to work and do things to make sure we do it right.”

Kate Moss Reads From '50 Shades of Grey'
By JACKIE WILLIS
March 15, 2013
The U.K.'s BBC Radio 1 somehow convinced the brooding supermodel Kate Moss to read from the wildly popular erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey in a segment they appropriately titled Fifty Shades of Kate.
As romantic music plays in the distance, 39-year-old Moss really goes for it, and reads with much enthusiasm and facial expressions. After she's done with the excerpt, she falls over laughing.
RELATED: You Won't Believe Who Called Fifty Shades Their 'Guilty Pleasure'
The 50 Shades reading was part of BBC's Radio 1 Red Nose Challenge, an event to raise money for charity through the power of laughter.

An editorial argues that the US Magnitsky law is a pro-Russian, not anti-Russian, act. Indeed, it targets specific officials accused of stealing from the Russian budget. The article says that for the Magnitsky measures to have a maximum impact, Europe show follow suit. Most effective of all would be an EU-wide visa ban and asset freeze. This could be adopted relatively easily, given sufficient political will, in a decision by its Council of Ministers – as has been done with officials from Belarus.Source: The Financial Times
In an interview Ivan Grachev, chairman of the State Duma Energy Committee, shares his expectations for 2013. In particular, the official comments: “For the past decade our country has been leading an uneasy dialogue with Europe about the Energy Charter. The Europeans hoped that the more liberal the Russian market became, the lower the price for energy carriers would be. However, the facts speak for themselves: the market was liberalised but the price for electric energy has gone up twelve-fold. We should keep explaining to the Europeans patiently that in case of fully liberal gas markets and other energy resources, they will just get an uncontrolled price growth.”Source: Oil and Gas Information Agency
Thane Gustafson, an expert in Russia’s oil industry at Georgetown University in the US, recently pointed out that virtually all new Russian production came from fields that were discovered during the Soviet period. He also said that the first slip in Russian oil production was predicted in 2015, with declines setting in during the second half of the decade.Source: The Financial Times
Russia’s 2012 oil output hit a post-Soviet record high level while natural gas production declined amid stalling European sales. The Russian energy ministry’s reporting unit said oil and gas condensate production grew by 1.3% last year to reach a new record of 10.40 million barrels per day. The current output rate outpaces that of Saudi Arabia and clinches for Russia the title of the world’s biggest oil producer. But Russia lacks the rapid ability of Saudi Arabia to boost output in case of a global economic rebound or more serious turmoil in the Middle East. It also appears to be unable to break through any further on large foreign markets to which it has no direct pipeline and that in some cases are starting to depend on US shale oil. Russia’s natural gas production meanwhile shrank by 2.3% to 655.0 billion cubic metres as its European sales shrivelled up. The drop reflects the reality that almost all of Gazprom’s foreign sales are focused on European and post-Soviet countries now experiencing some of the slowest growth rates in the world. The European Union -importing about 30% of its gas from Russia – has made a priority of diversifying suppliers in a bid to ease its political dependence on Moscow.Source: Agence France Presse

Born three years after the accession of Queen Elizabeth, my memory is coloured by events, punctuated by sub-clauses, and swayed by the influences of this woman's life. In this regard I am no different from any other Australian over the age of say 40. How exactly to understand these traces in memory is more difficult to discern.
Those brought up with the Book of Common Prayer each Sunday of their childhood were asked to pray in intercessions for the Queen and all the royal family.
It was never explained then that we had the prayer book because we had the Queen, that the English Civil War had left scars on the English psyche which argued for centuries of monarchy. Australian hesitancy to adopt a republic is, I believe, explained in part by this British refusal ever to go back to the disasters of Cromwell.
My parents' generation were avid followers of the young Elizabeth. Teachers and elders read me A. A. Milne's poem about Christopher Robin going 'down with Alice' to Buckingham Palace, as though it were an everyday occurrence. That they themselves had never been to London was beside the point. They were in a constant state of going to watch the changing of the guard, even if it was only in their own minds.
A similar statement about the barriers between us and them, subjects and royals, was made by that defining artistic phenomenon of Elizabeth's reign, The Beatles. John Lennon sang about the miserly Mean Mr Mustard who 'goes out to look at the Queen, only place that he's ever been, always shouts something obscene', a warning to Little Englanders to get real and expand their horizons.
One curate in our parish was the complete royal watcher. He knew every twig of the family tree, could quote quintessential quips from court history and knew more about Mrs Simpson than was proper. He claimed to dream about the royal family regularly and believed everyone had dreams about them. It was pointed out to me once that he had no family of his own and the royal family was a helpful substitute.
This easy familiarity with an idealised dream family collapsed for me at the impressionable age of 20, when I had to absorb the dismissal of the elected Australian government by her majesty's representative.
When Sir John Kerr handed Gough Whitlam the papers indicating that he was sacked, Whitlam's first question was, 'Have you notified the Palace?' Kerr's reply apparently was, 'It's too late for that now.' It is ironic that the republican movement was kickstarted not by a bushranger like Ned Kelly or a suave politico like Paul Keating, but by an industrial lawyer who late in life developed vice-regal pretensions.
To this day it is not clear what Elizabeth thought. As historian Geoffrey Blainey observed at the time, Kerr's actions revealed not how close the nation's relationships were with England, but how far apart they had become.
There is a saying that the French are republicans when there is a monarchy and monarchists when there is a republic; many Australians enjoy a similar two-mindedness. Malcolm Turnbull is persuasive when he says that in Australia there are now more Elizabethans than monarchists. For most people of my parents' generation this would have been heresy. Meanwhile the mythic reality of Elizabeth's reign is only enhanced and remade.
Like all the monarchs of England, Elizabeth is a literary creation as well as a human being. The majority of her subjects know about her through words and images. Most everything I know about Elizabeth is only through artificial means: newspapers, films, books. This hyperreality is intensified by decades of opinions and stories, ranging from the inexpressibly effusive to the effectively unprintable.
The code of not repeating what the Queen says in private is well kept, such that the myth will blow out of all proportion when she dies and the 'full story' goes public. Elizabeth is supposed to be highly informed and witty, but I cannot instantly think of one witty thing she has said in the 60 years of her reign.
The curate was probably right when he said we have all dreamt about the Queen. These traces of memory blur into our unconscious, which is why I finish this reflection with two other works of popular period art.
In 1982 an intruder to the palace was found sitting at the edge of her majesty's bed. He was harmless, the alarm was called off, and questions were raised about security.
This incident inspired the alternative Manchester band The Smiths to write their black-humoured classic 'The Queen is Dead'. There is nothing innocent about the intruder in this song, who claims to do something very nasty with a rusty spanner. He commits the crime on the grounds that he feels lonely and needs someone to talk to.
The song plays to the shadow side of our relationship with people in positions of power. Assassination, or the imaginary possibility of ridding ourselves of those with influence over us, towards whom we are jealous or angry, is a possibility there in the unconscious. How we choose to counter that temptation is another matter.
A more positive person from the world of the unconscious is The BFG. Queen Elizabeth, or a person precisely fitting her description, is one of the main characters in Roald Dahl's wonderful children's story.
Sophie gets to know the Big Friendly Giant, a benevolent character who collects good dreams and distributes them to children in the secrecy of the night. All the other giants are going out eating people and to stop this vicious destruction Sophie and the BFG go to the one person who will be able to help.
Breaking into the palace they freak out the staff, but the Queen remains completely well-mannered and attentive, calling for breakfast to be served and making the BFG feel at home.
Dahl makes Queen Elizabeth the centre of calm, the person inside us who is rational and conciliatory, the problem solver. Not only is she not afraid of the BFG, she believes what he says and acts on his information. She is the way out of our present crisis. Without her, who knows what we might have to do next?

Your curate, Philip, in his attitude to the monarchy, reminds me of the fawning approach taken by Mr Collins to his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, in "Pride and Prejudice". These were the days when some Anglican clerics here adopted a faux "English" accent. I remember them well. Were these "elevations by (vague) association"? Quite possibly. I think there is Elizabeth Windsor, a real person and the persona she has to wear as Queen. Of course, with the rise of "celebrity" journalism, where millions of bored people follow the banal lives of film stars and sporting "heroes", she and her family are always "relevant" and their lives, in minute detail, are scrutinised in the press. Did those who - like my sister-in-law - "grieved" over Princess Diana's death really "care", or was she merely a peg to hang their dreams on? Dreams which ceased at her death? You are, I believe, raising an interesting question about people who "identify" with the monarchy.
Pam01 Jun 2012
Our 'elevation' of the Queen is a quirk of human nature. Dare I mention in the same breath Mary, mother of Jesus. Both the Queen and Mary are human but elevated by State and Church. And when ordinary women are viewed as either 'Queen' or 'Mary' the misogynistic State and Church are shown in gory detail. The Queen is Elizabeth Windsor, a person placed in a position by fate/ birth (what you will) and instead of walking away which would have been extremely difficult, she has performed her 'duties' to the best of her ability. Mary, an ordinary young woman, was chosen by God for a unique task. So Mary was unique but when women are viewed as substitute 'Queens' and 'Marys' then real 'identities' are swept aside. And the people who sweep the real identities aside, lose their own identities.
Alan Austin01 Jun 2012
Philip, you say "I cannot instantly think of one witty thing she has said in the 60 years of her reign."
Can anyone think of anything she has said at all other than platitudes written by palace speechwriters?
Apart, of course, from "I myself prefer my New Zealand eggs for breakfast."
Brian Poidevin01 Jun 2012
I suspect "annus horribilis" was not the product of of a palace speech writer. The present system works o.k. would it be improved by electing a president. I doubt if Australians if asked to vote on republic would come at our wildly respected parliament appointing a president.
L Newington01 Jun 2012
To be honest, the way things stand in the church today, if we ever did become a republic, I dread the pressures placed on any Catholic presidential candidate.
At this point in time, for me it's "Long Live the Queen".
Richard Laidlaw01 Jun 2012
A thought-provoking piece and a joy to read. It recalls the tale of the Curate's egg. On a practical level, the de facto situation is that Australia is a crowned republic; it is a system that actually works well but which time and tide will eventually wash away. I believe that time will be soon, but it should not be accompanied by vacuous rudeness on one side or sentimental tears on the other. The issue for Australians is what we choose to replace what one might call the Present Fiction. A popularly elected President is not an option. It would create rival political leaderships and require - certainly it would lead to - constitutional change that might well be invidious. So there's a lot of work to be done there. I don't believe that narrative has yet truly begun. I do think that Elizabeth is our last British monarch; so time is necessarily short.
jean Sietzema-Dickson01 Jun 2012
Thanks Philip,
I share your journey in many ways and l loved the way you put it.
Brian Larsson01 Jun 2012
Much of the comment seems to have moved little in my seven decades from the English propaganda of empire we were all raised to believe in.
One day, hopefully very soon, we might all get over the maudlin elevation surrounding this good woman.
PHILIP HARVEY02 Jun 2012
Here are some responses to comments. To Edward F.: The curate is the subject of much humour in English literature, in part because in English society (especially in the time of Austen and Trollope) to be a curate was to have settled on a role in life that was secure but not prestigious. Many curates become influential people in our own society after they have their own parish, but you don’t read about them in newspapers so they are ‘invisible’. The curate in my essay did not affect a faux English accent. His favourite novelist was Evelyn Waugh and his favourite singer was Judy Garland. As you can imagine, his sermons were an unpredictable surprise. To Pam: ‘The Catholic imaginary and the cults of Elizabeth, 1558-1582’ by Stephen Hamrick is but one book that shows how the Protestants transferred Catholic worldviews and practice onto the Queen, when they no longer had a cult of Mary.
To Brian Poidevin: the Annus Horribilis speech was certainly a drastic shift from “My husband and I …” By using Latin she was speaking to history. The speech placed herself and her role up against the collective media of the time, but also distanced herself and her established role as Queen over against the indulgent, dimwitted behaviour of some of the younger royals. You will notice “My husband and I…” was dropped about the same time as the rise of feminism in England. To
Brian Larsson: it is in the nature of things that one form of propaganda will inevitably be replaced by the next form of propaganda. Propaganda is a symptom of political power. On inspection, I would say the hoopla surrounding the diamond jubilee is infinitely more benign than some other kinds of present day propaganda we could mention.

Thank you for your response, Philip. It sounds like your curate had literary taste and wasn't a stereotype. I found many Anglican clerics of yesteryear stereotypical. Many were, I suspect, living up to expectations. Others didn't and were magnificent.

A majority of voters in all States votes against a republic . The Queen ( and by parity of reasoning , the monarchical syatem of government) is probably even more favoured now than at the time of the referendum. The system works well . It coped well with the Whitlam/Kerr/Frazer matter in the 1970s >There is no impetus for change .An ideosyncratic view ( as with the writer of the article ) does not make for a general view.
Long live our Constitution and the sovereign who is part of it .
And hands off the flag- which some republicans want to change.
Peter Kennedy04 Jun 2012
Any evidence for your claim that the republican movement was "kickstarted by" John Kerr?
I don't recall any significant sudden rise in republicanism just after 1975. Republicanism had bubbled along as a rather small minority opinion in Australia from the mid-19th century until Keating gave it a kick along, it reached its peak of a near-majority in the late 1990s and has since fallen back to its historically usual position of a minority opinion sponsored by a few high-profile enthusiasts.
You claim "To this day it is not clear what Elizabeth thought" about Kerr's dismissal of the Whitlam government. The Queen's spokesman made it publicly clear at the time that the Queen intended to take no action because it was a matter for Australians to sort out amongst themselves. A consequence of the independence granted to the Australian government by the Statue of Westminster in 1932 (which Australia was so unenthusiastic about it didn't bother to ratify until 1941). If Kerr's actions only "revealed" Australia's independence to some people at the time, it just goes to show the level of public ignorance and/or apathy about our constitutional arrangements.
You call Kerr "an industrial lawyer who late in life developed vice-regal pretensions."
Kerr did not pretend to be a vice-regent. He actually WAS one. Appointed to the position by Whitlam who thought that with his solid ALP-supporting background he would be a useful puppet who would do as he was told to promote the ALP and its agenda at all costs. Then Kerr decided he was going to actually do the job, not just be Whitlam's puppet. Rather reminiscent of Henry II manoeuvring to get his best mate Thomas Becket appointed Archbishop of Canterbury to get the church's blessing for his political actions, only to find that once he had the job Becket decided to actually do the job without fear or favour.

I thought her unscripted reply to Paul McCartney, when he suggested another concert/party in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, "not in my backyard" was witty.
PHILIP HARVEY04 Jun 2012
To Peter Kennedy: well yes, of course John Kerr was Governor-General. It was after he advanced to that square on the chessboard that it all went to his head, with behaviour that could only be caused by individual pretensions. His second wife had a lot to do with it, to believe the histories. Kerr’s dismissal of the government was an act of extraordinary political pretension, meaning it was out of all proportion to the role of Governor-General as understood by practice and precedent. Kerr was deluded enough to believe he was the equal of Whitlam and that his job was as vital to Australia’s future as that of the Prime Minister. He is the only Governor-General who has ever thought that. As was revealed after Sir Zelman Cowen’s death this year, Malcolm Fraser knew he had to appoint someone as Governor-General who was universally liked, who could undo the damage to the office caused by Kerr. Unlike Thomas Becket, Kerr was not a saint. Patrick White predicted accurately that Kerr will be a footnote.
Peter Kennedy05 Jun 2012
I'm certainly not claiming Kerr was a saint! I was comparing Whitlam's actions to Henry II's.
Please explain by what process you have read the thoughts of every Governor General living or dead and are able to state definitively that Kerr is the only Governor-General who has ever thought that he had the power to dismiss a government. On the contrary I would say it is likely that most if not all other G-Gs would have done the same in the same circumstances (not necessarily in exactly the same way).
Of course Fraser had to appoint someone as Governor-General who was universally liked. That was nothing new. It just became more necessary then because of the campaign the ALP had conducted against Kerr for, as they saw it, becoming a "Labor rat" and deserting the ALP cause after the ALP had placed him in high office in return for his lifelong devotion to it.

Rewarding Lightness, From Top to Bottom
The best way to encourage lightness, empathy, and compassion in training, is to reward those that employ it in their everyday work. The tricky part lies in detecting and indeed finding the margin in a competitive dressage arena, to place these dressage riders above those that use harmful or forceful methods.
So how does a top judge detect lightness in training in elite level dressage? And how do they then reward these combinations, effectively placing them above other perhaps more powerful or flamboyant horses, to give riders and trainers the incentive to train in the right way?
"Every top athlete, be it man or horse, needs a certain amount of positive tension to compete at the highest level," says O-Judge Stephen Clarke. “However, there is a world of difference between healthy ‘positive tension’ and destructive physical stress and mental anxiety.”
Stephen Clarke mentions that the most obvious sign of stress is when the paces become jerky or artificial; often the trot appears hectic or staccato, losing its natural fluidity and cadence. Sometimes the walk can deteriorate to the point where the horse is unable to relax into a clear and regular four beat, or even may jog or show ‘piaffe like’ steps throughout. The canter again may lose its clear three time beat and either ‘scratches’ along the ground with barely a moment of suspension, or if the back is so tight, may appear to show climbing, laboured steps with very limited action of the hind legs (“The paralysing effect of resistance” Podhajsky) Also the horse may, through anxiety, be unable to maintain immobility at the halt, or even halt at all.”
Danish O-judge, Leif Törnblad, acknowledges that we cannot know what goes on behind the scenes, but a judge must learn to pick up on those subtle signs of stress in the dressage horse.
"The usual signs of stress are open mouth and resistance on the bit, grinding teeth, tongue hanging out, sweating horses, swishing tails. All that is well known to everybody, but as a judge you will have to take these signs as a signal of something else."
However, Leif says this is very complex, as for example some horses may grind their teeth, but this isn't always a direct sign of stress. "A horse might grind his teeth without being in stress, as they may be just eager and excited!"
The important thing however, as a judge, is to not only detect the sign of stress, but examine the context and attempt to establish a more concrete verdict as to what may be causing such signs to appear.
"When I see the obvious sign I try to detect other more profound and serious signals,” says Leif. “Is the horse forced into a too rigid frame between hands – seat and legs? Is the back swinging or can you see tension in the top line? Is the horse willing and moving forward easily?"
Mexican O-Judge, Maribel Alonso, finds that tension is most commonly detected "when the purity of the paces is altered. The horse should look relaxed and comfortable with his rider, moving with ease and regularity. If a horse is stressed or tense; the connection with the mouth is no longer soft and still, the contact becomes unsteady, tongue pulled up, or tongue out, the neck becomes too short, the full expression of the horse loses harmony and confidence, the horse will hollow in the back etc."
Certain that incorrect training will manifest itself in all three gaits, the judges all agree that the tension can become even more obvious in the walk. "Especially in the collected walk," says Maribel
Leif adds that "the walk will become very tense and short or even without clear rhythm, and says the canter can also become hectic and with a stiff top line. "Flying changes are thus made very short, and again hectic, if the horse is under pressure."
Stephen stresses that “the main objective of correct dressage is to establish the horse’s natural paces and enhance them through systematic and gymnastic training Poor training will manifest itself in the deterioration of all three paces”.
Leif knows, however, that it is unavoidable during some periods of training, that a horse may become a bit stressed, but a good rider will be able to quickly ease the tension, and calm the horse in the appropriate way.
"When learning new movements, for example, he may become stressed, but if the rider takes it the easy way and does not repeat difficult (for the horse) movements during the learning process, this sort of stress will be a minor problem. Unfortunately you very often see riders that repeat the movements that are difficult for the horse many times in the warming up, and even around the arena. The only outcome of that is that the horse performs worse in the arena."
There are a number of ways harmful and unjust training can present itself, but equally obvious are the many signals of light, effective, well balanced training techniques.
"A well trained talented horse moves easily forward with attentive ears and a closed mouth and can execute the different movements with ease."
According to Maribel "lightness can be detected when the horse has been correctly trained showing elasticity and flexibility throughout its performance, being smooth and fluent and achieving perfect balance. We can observe it in a well performed transition free of tension or resistance".
“The horse that presents such a high degree of lightness and self carriage showing a steady and flawless contact are unmistakably the best trained ones and therefore they are the ones awarded the highest scores. I am sure that those high scores as well as the incredible feeling such trained horse provides become the incentive to improve the way of training."
The outcome of correct training, Stephen says that lightness and self-carriage will only be achieved "when all of the criteria of the Scale of Training have been met".
"Only then, will the horse have the balance and the elasticity in his paces to show a lightness of footfall that, to the onlooker, appears to be hardly touching the ground," says Clarke. "Only when the training is fully developed and the horse is truly light on the ground and in a genuine self carriage, will he be able to demonstrate absolute harmony and expression throughout all of the exercises. We have been lucky enough to witness this at the recent London Olympic Games, which surely in itself will be an incentive for riders to train in the right way if they want the highest points."
With the power and brilliance of the horses being produced today, I wondered if the training might be being compromised as a result of all this power, and that perhaps it needed to adjust or slow, in order not to restrict what the breeding world is producing?
"I think the breeding is moving in the right direction and that the riders have become better and more clever when they select a good horse for dressage. The present Olympic gold winner, Valegro, is a good example of a fantastic athlete, even if he is not the most beautiful horse when he is standing still.” says Leif . “A well deserved victory for Britain and the horse, Valegro's training also appears to have been undertaken with a lot of feeling and in a good manner!"
"In my opinion breeding has changed and is constantly developing in a very positive way," says Clarke. "Compared to earlier times, riders of today have already so much more access to horses with beautiful conformation and inherent gymnastic ability. I believe this is one of the main reasons that we now have so many combinations vying for the top spots, which makes our sport all the more exciting. I am convinced that the breeding has changed for the better. In my opinion it has improved so much that is has become a challenge to trainers, riders and judges. Riders and trainers have to be even more aware of the importance of correct basic training in order to preserve this movement and expression. The last Olympic Games has been a clear example of how many good riders and trainers there are as we had the opportunity to witness some performances that were an inspiration for the upcoming GP elite riders of the world."
The judges make an excellent point and really it is up to the entire dressage community -- trainers, riders, and judges -- to meet the challenge, take time to establish the horses confidence, and accommodate the horses natural talent and expression into our everyday work.
While judges may never know what truly goes on behind the scenes, it is with the desire to reward true lightness and commend the happiness of the horse, that a brighter dressage future will be ensured for our equine partners . And in order to promote correct education and training we must first award those at the highest level, acknowledging them as the true ambassadors of our sport.
And it seems the world's best is on top of it!

EU Countries: Les relations professionnelles dans le secteur de l’agriculture
Le secteur de l'agriculture, qui emploie environ 5 % de la main-d’œuvre de l’Union européenne (et un pourcentage nettement plus élevé dans les nouveaux États membres et les pays candidats), connaît actuellement d’importantes modifications structurelles, notamment en raison de la réforme de la politique agricole commune et du récent élargissement de l’Union vers l’est. La présente étude examine les relations professionnelles dans le secteur agricole de l’Union européenne (plus la Bulgarie, la Norvège et la Roumanie) et, plus particulièrement, en ce qui concerne l’emploi et les salaires, les lois et règlements sectoriels, les partenaires sociaux, les négociations collectives, les autres formes de dialogue social et de consultation, les conflits et les litiges. On y relève que les relations professionnelles dans ce secteur sont particulières, notamment en raison du niveau élevé d’activité indépendante et, généralement, de la faible proportion de salariés.

Slovenia: Unions protest against government's reform programme
On 26 November 2005, trade unions jointly organised the largest demonstrations since Slovenia independence, in opposition to the government’s reform programme. The core and most controversial part of the programme is the introduction of a flat tax rate, which the trade unions and many other NGOs totally reject. Unions also argue that talks over a new tripartite social agreement for 2006-9 are pointless if the government persists with the introduction of the flat tax rate.

The main argument against the Services Directive is that it will lead to social dumping. In the Netherlands, however, the response to the proposed Services Directive has been generally positive. The unions and Dutch government alike are committed to the recommendation put forward by the Social and Economic Council (Sociaal Economische Raad, SER).

Since 2004, employers must pay wage compensation to employees for the first 10 calendar days of their temporary sickness absence. The government has proposed further changes to employees’ sickness insurance with the aim of decreasing the compulsory contributions of employers. The intended changes mean that employers will pay less social insurance but will have to pay wage compensation for up to 14 days. However, the social partners have criticised and rejected the intended changes; as a result, the government has revised the original proposal for changes.

Latvia: Unions call for renewed social dialogue
The practice of social dialogue has fallen off in Latvia recently, following the break-down of discussions between the government and the social partners on critical socio-economic issues. Following an initiative from the social partners, a trilateral agreement had been concluded which explicitly defined the rights of the parties and extended the field of influence for social dialogue. However, this did not improve the situation. Despite these failures, the Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia continues to press the government on the issue of renewing the operations of the social dialogue institutions.

Latvia: Emigration of Latvian workers continues to increase
Since Latvia’s accession to the European Union, Latvian businesses and workers have been making use of the provisions of the four freedoms, i.e. free movement of goods, services, persons and capital within the EU. This has had both positive and negative effects. While Latvian workers have proved to be competitive in the labour markets of other European countries, this has raised concerns among local trade unions. Meanwhile, Latvian employers are starting to witness labour force deficits due to the increasing levels of emigration.

Austria: Supreme Court of Justice judges bank’s agreement hoppingas lawful
In a decision of December 2005, the Supreme Court of Justice (OGH) ruled that a move of Austria’s BA-CA bank corporation from the savings banks employers’ association to the commercial banks association was lawful. The main aim of this move was to change over from the savings banks collective agreement to the - from the bank’s point of view - cheaper commercial banks agreement. The union side expressed its disappointment over this decision and warns of copying such practices of agreement hoppingby other employers.

Finland: Rulings issued in bargaining disputes at Are and Uponor
Two Finnish companies, Are and Uponor, attempted in early 2005 to start applying different sectoral collective agreements by changing their employers’ organisation affiliation. These initiatives were contested and referred by unions to the Labour Court, which issued its rulings in October and November 2005. Uponor was allowed by the Court to change agreements while Are was not. Both cases were finally decided by establishing which agreement first bound the employer. Neither the company's sector of production nor the level of trade union representation were seen as reasons to uphold the old agreements, as had been hoped by unions.

Austria: Government plans to abolish permanent tenure for civil servants
In December 2005, Austria's conservative-populist government announced plans to abolish the permanent tenure of appointment that applies to public employees, and thus their absolute protection against dismissal. The proposals would establish in the civil service a single category of public employee, employed on a private-law basis with uniform service regulations. A draft bill on the issue should be presented early in 2006. Trade unions are strongly opposed, raising questions about the quality of public services and the constitutionality of uniform service regulations, as well as expressing concern about the future independence from political interference of civil servants, especially judges.

Norway: Nordic trade unions' international activities examined
A report published in Norway in 2005 finds significant variations in the international work carried out by Nordic trade unions. Most unions do engage in international activity - and report increased time spent on such activities - but only a minority of unions engage in large-scale efforts, measured in time dedicated or the number of issues covered. International trade union organisations at the Nordic and European levels play an important role in the international activities of Nordic trade unions.

Slovenia: Rail workers’ trade unions divided over restructuring
In 2005, the Slovenian government has been considering a further restructuring of the Slovenian Railways Holding Company (HSZ). At present, there are three rail companies, dealing with infrastructure, passenger transport and freight transport respectively, with the latter two undergoing partial privatisation. Railway workers' trade unions are split over the issue - apparently reflecting the diverging interests of their members - with some favouring the current situation and others calling for a return to a single unified rail company.
- 06 Jan 2006
Slovenia: Strikes held on railways
In November 2005, several short strikes were organised by the Railway Traffic Union of Slovenia (SZPS) and some smaller rail trade unions. The strikes appeared to relate both to current plans to restructure the Slovenian Railways Holding Company and to demands for better working conditions. The majority of rail unions opposed the strikes.

Latvia: Trade unions seek to boost membership
Trade union density in Latvia is only around 15.5% and unions have severe problems in organising in a number of sectors. However, during 2005, unions have made renewed efforts to increase their membership, publicise their activities, put forward demands and expand to new areas, assisted in some respects by financing from EU funds.

Netherlands: Calls for reinstatement of public maternity benefits for self-employed
In late 2005, the Dutch Trade Union Federation (FNV) and the Dutch Federation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MKB-Nederland) called for the reinstatement of a public maternity benefit scheme for self-employed people. The scheme was abolished in 2004, with the idea being that it could be replaced by private insurance arrangements. However, in practice insurers have reportedly declined many applications and self-employed people have been deterred by high premiums. At the request of parliament, the government has also consulted the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Dutch Equal Treatment Commission about whether it was entitled under international and EU law to abolish the maternity benefits.

Spain: Fatal accident reignites debate over safety in construction
A serious accident in November 2005, resulting in the death of six workers involved in the construction of a motorway in Andalusia, has led to a major debate on the relationship between occupational risk prevention and employment conditions in the Spanish construction sector. Trade unions called a protest work stoppage and have linked the high industrial accident rate in construction to the sector's high levels of subcontracting, temporary employment and overtime working.

France: Draft agreement reached on promoting employment of older workers
Negotiations among the French social partners on promoting employment for older workers opened in February 2005 and resulted in a draft national intersectoral agreement in October. Measures agreed include a new form of fixed-term contract for workers over the age of 57. However, the trade unions have reservations, especially as linked negotiations on retirement for workers with arduous working conditions and on unemployment insurance are still under way, while the government is preparing a plan for the employment of older workers.

Poland: Enterprise-level social dialogue in 2005 assessed
Based on recent research, this article examines social dialogue at the level of individual enterprises in Poland, as of 2005. It finds that issues such as trade union presence and employee representation depend strongly on company size, sector of activity and form of ownership (ie public or private). In general, trade unions face a very difficult situation in the private sector (especially in services) and among smaller enterprises.

Italy: New collective agreement reached for telecommunications sector
In December 2005, trade unions and employers in the Italian telecommunications sector signed a draft collective agreement for the 2005-8 period. The industry's 120,000 workers will now be asked to approve the new agreement in workplace assemblies. The deal introduces numerous changes, notably an extension of its coverage to include call-centre companies and the introduction of new rules on subcontracting and outsourcing. Both sides have expressed their satisfaction with the draft agreement, although worries have been voiced concerning the issue of market regulation and the role of the Guarantee Authority for Telecommunications.

The European Citizen’s initiative, in force since 1 April 2012, is an unprecedented opportunity for European people to unite in order to influence the flow of European politics. EP Vice President Georgios Papastamkos, who agreed to answer questions on the Initiative submitted by followers of the Parliament's Facebook page, believes it could be the beginning of something bigger, a true "Citizens' Europe".
How will the initiative solve any of Europe’s problems? Shouldn’t Parliament concentrate on making European elections a true contest instead? For example, by having each political group nominate its own candidate for Commission President and then leave it to the citizens to decide who gets the post? This would really bring politics to Europe.
From this time onwards Europe’s citizens can participate in the EU’s legislative process by asking the Commission to propose rules on issues that fall within its competences. In this vein, the Lisbon Treaty helps to address one of the main problems the Union faces, namely the lack of citizens’ participation in its democratic life. Your question is extremely interesting and is already the subject of much debate in the European Parliament. I have personally supported the direct election of Commissioners, alongside MEPs, already since the 1990s. However, this is an issue that is so far discussed de lege ferenda (in view of future legislation) as it is not possible to do so currently under the provisions of the existing Treaties.
What are EU officials to do if they receive widely supported initiatives asking for radical change in the European Union, in terms of either further integration or even disintegration?
I hope this innovative concept will have the response you indicate in your question. I personally believe that the degree of support that each initiative receives from citizens must be taken into account by the Commission when it decides whether to take it up or not. We hope for Initiatives that will further European integration. However, demands that are at odds with the Union’s principles cannot become the object of an Initiative. In any case, receiving, evaluating and acting upon any initiative actually presupposes a minimum European integration and of course that the Commission has a right of initiative in the respective area.
How will Parliament help ECI organisers? How will the public hearings in Parliament be carried out?
Parliament will offer those organising an Initiative all the assistance it can provide, both in terms of infrastructure and human resources, to enable them to present it in the best possible way. In addition to the organisers and the representatives of the EU Institutions, representatives of civil society and all interested parties will be invited to the public hearings. Holding these hearings in the only directly elected EU institution will send a very strong signal.
Do you fear that interesting Initiatives (such as the one potentially spawned by the “One Seat” campaign for Parliament itself) will not be admitted for lack of Commission authority to deal with it? Can this requirement be overcome?
My concern is that some will be disappointed, not because their initiative didn’t have the results they expected, but because of the extremely high expectations that some are purposefully cultivating or will seek to cultivate in the future. Both President Schulz and I have on every occasion underlined the need to better inform citizens about the rules and the requirements and what can objectively be asked of the Commission through an initiative. The example of the Parliament’s seat is an obvious case in point: it is simply beyond the Commission’s legislative remit, as the seat of the Institutions is set by common agreement of the governments of the member states. We must in all cases defend this truly innovative instrument from any attempt to discredit or manipulate it. There is a wide scope of initiatives to be taken that could help making Europe more visible, more democratic and more efficient; a real "Europe of Citizens".

This edition will, for one day only, feature no discussions of the foregone conclusion of Lane Kiffin's sanity.
"We're the swim team." "Of course you are." Someone in an conference room said into a speakerphone: "Barry Switzer in a coach's shirt and holding a cup of Dunkin' Donuts coffee." And magic happens every day now:
Pick up Petunia!
Like Greg Robinson winning a football game at Syracuse, it only happens twice a year, but when it does it is massive. Cake Rocks the Party may only post twice a year, but it's nice when they do, especially with all 119 teams covered in a single breathless post, with Air Force setting the hook..
The rest is just as tangentially entertaining, even if he is the first person in the history of the internet to match the word "meh" and "Tim Tebow."
True, sad, but still true. Scoff if you like--his name is still tattooed on your soul--but Steve Spurrier really is right about this: He's had the best four-year run at South Carolina in school history. It's been that bad in the present, yes, but it was far, far, far worse in the past.
FURTHER STEELE!!! His Monday blog ponders teams with three close losses who could improve at the margins for 2009 (See: Iowa,) and he made one of his 3,498 daily radio appearances to talk Navy football on Scout's Midshipmen podcast.
As Bill put it: It's warm body time at BC.

EVGATech_DaveB The pump can go with 1-2 more devices, but I really wouldnt trry to add any more in with only a 240 RAD, ESPECIALLY if you plan to overclock. Would it heat to the point of worrying about damage, no, but you will overload the system and not have the capacity to cool it as well as you want.
loveha It is best to go 120mm for every component to get the best cooling.
EVGATech_DaveB The 360 kit would be a better way to go, a 240 for 4 components is just too light, frankly, I think that thee 360 might give you temps a bit higher than you would likely want but better than air. Overall should be a good setup.
jh4db536 How is this priced cmpared to the swiftech kit? Swiftech 240 or 360 radiator combo block, res and pump will save you fittings, hose, take up less space and is totally expandable, think it comes with the newest apogee hd cpu block too. Later down the road you could upgrade pump to 35x or add another radiator to the loop or gpu blocks.
feniks thank you! My room ambients are pretty high as for NJ ... in Summer 27-28C is rather normal in my apartment, even with AC on during the day ... I discovered one problem though ... it seems that XSPC RASA CPU backplate will NOT fit the Z68 motherboard ... need to contact FrozenCPU, maybe I will be able to swap this block (paying the difference and shipping only) with Raystorm block which has 100x better backplate ... RASA block backplate, no way it fits Z68: Raystorm block backplate, should fit easily, opening in center is huge: back of EVGA z68 ftw board (not my pic):
loveha I don't see what the issue is. The back plate normally lays on the CPU Socket retention plate. Unless there is something else I am missing.

That’s it! You’ve finally decided to get your life back on track by bringing in some much needed stress management and relaxation, and you have decided that yoga is the answer. However, for any newcomer to the yoga scene, it can be quite a daunting and intimidating task finding the right yoga class. So how do you figure out which yoga class is right for you? Well, first of all, you should have a clear understanding of what yoga is, what the different types of yoga are, and what it is that you are looking for from your practice.
Yoga is an ancient science that originated in India thousands of years ago, and which is now being practiced by millions of people around the world. Yoga is the science of right living and its goal is to peel away the layers that cloud our ability to see clearly. Its aim is also to bring balance, health and well being back into an individual, so that the individual is then able to feel their deep connection to the infinite energy that we call God or Spirit. This sense of oneness can then be extended towards all beings and enables us to live in a spirit of deep peace, love and harmony.
There are many different types of yoga and it is important that you find the type that is best suited both to your personality and to your needs. The type of yoga that most people are familiar with and which is most commonly practiced today is Hatha Yoga. This is a system of yoga that uses asanas (physical postures), pranayama (breathing techniques) and meditation, to bring physical, mental and emotional balance to an individual. There are many different ways to practice Hatha Yoga, and some can be more challenging than others, so make sure to try out a variety of classes so that you find a teacher and a style that you like and connect to. It is also important to find a class that is structured specially for beginners, so that you will not feel intimidated or discouraged and also so that you do not become injured. Check too to make sure that the teacher holds a valid certification from a qualified yoga school.
There are also other types of yoga that can be practiced along with Hatha Yoga, and in fact, this is what is recommended in order to gain the most out of your practice.
Bhakti yoga is the yoga of devotion and is a means of channeling the pure energy of feeling and emotion for the discovery of the inner self, the pure being. It is a suitable path for those who are emotional and for those who feel an affinity to some form of God or higher being. It is also a counterbalance for those who are overly intellectual or rational, releasing blocked emotions and restrictive thought patterns. Bhakti yoga practices include chanting the names of divinity and surrender to a Higher Being.
Raja Yoga is the path of meditation. It is based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, commonly associated with “the 8 limbs” of Ashtanga Yoga: yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dyhana, samadhi. Its aim is to enter into the realm of psychic consciousness in order to discover the dormant areas of the mind and the consciousness.
Karma Yoga is the meditative awareness of activities in everyday life. It is also the yoga of selfless service where one performs work without the expectation of reward.
Gyana yoga is the process of meditative awareness that brings us closer to our inner nature. It is a process of inquiry that results in illumined or intuitive knowledge of this inner nature. The knowledge that is sought in gyana yoga isn’t intellectual knowledge. It is wisdom, or intuitive knowledge of our true nature.
Mantra Yoga is the chanting or repetition of sounds, which have an effect on the mental and psychic consciousness of man.
Ideally, one combines all of these types of yoga, known as Integral Yoga, so as to bring about a perfectly balanced state of being. However, they can all be practiced separately and are all perfectly valid paths in and of themselves.
If however, you are looking to yoga for relief from back pain and injury, or if you have high blood pressure or any other medical issue, then Yoga Therapy may be what you need. This is where a qualified Yoga Therapist gives you a personalized program that specifically addresses your issues. Generalized yoga classes are not recommended if these (among other) issues are present, as many yoga postures can and will aggravate these existing problems.
It is also important to know what it is that you would like to gain from your practice. Whether it is physical, mental, emotional or spiritual health and well being, having some goals in mind will give you the motivation and discipline that you will need to stay committed to your practice. Most of all be patient. The effects of your practice accumulate over time so regularity and consistency are key. Many people report feeling better after only their first yoga class, and that feeling of wellness simply increases the more yoga that you do. Eventually, it becomes something that you cannot live without. Yoga is life and life is yoga.
The divine light in me honors the divine light in you.
Namaste.

Google Wiki, Where Art Thou?.
"We have to anticipate that at some point Google will offer a Google wiki to leverage some of what they got out of that investment beyond two great search executives," Mayfield told eWEEK, taking a slight shot at the search giant.
Socialtext reloads. Click here to read more.
Jordan Frank, vice president of marketing for Traction Software, which makes the TeamPage wiki, said he expects the wiki software will be mashed in with the hosted Google Apps.
Such an approach would significantly boost Google Apps, adding new layers of collaboration for consumers and businesses. However, trying to get the JotSpot code to work with the various Google Apps can be a tricky architectural challenge, which is likely why the software hasnt yet surfaced.
Frank said the large volume of Google account holders, and the ease with which consumers and professionals can use Google Apps for informal file sharing and calendaring, would put wiki technology into the hands of many user groups who wouldnt have considered trying to use one for day-to-day information management.
Google is mum on the speculation but did acknowledge the association with Google Apps.
"Google shares JotSpots vision for helping people collaborate, share and work together online, and JotSpots team and technology are a strong fit with existing Google products like Google Apps," a Google spokesperson told eWEEK.
Analysts, who typically have their noses pretty close to the ground, arent having much better luck getting a bead on Googles wiki plans.
Forrester Research analyst Oliver Young told eWEEK he asked specifically about JotSpot and was told the company has big plans for the technology but is trying to make sure the integration is right before launching.
Meanwhile, a steady burble of announcements around enterprise wikis is triggering questions about Googles talked-about wiki offering.
Web content management provider acquired wiki software specialist Infostoria Oct. 29. Socialtext Nov. 5 installed a new CEO and banked $9.5 million in funding, and Traction upgraded its enterprise blog and wiki software Nov. 12.
To read more about Tractions new wiki software, click here.
Moreover, open-source wiki specialist MindTouch will soon trot out a new wiki hosting service for creating mashups and composite applications.
While he wouldnt publicly speculate on what Google is doing with the JotSpot assets, MindTouch co-founder Aaron Fulkerson did his part of an open-source torch bearer, claiming that he doesnt put much stock in proprietary wiki solutions.
Fulkerson told eWEEK the proprietary approach will ultimately prove fatal for wiki providerseven Googlebecause customers dont want to use closed systems for collaboration.

OSHA tries to put the brakes on asbestos precautions
. On top of that it appears that the Big Three automakers are behind the arm-twisting and intimidation of Wainless with lobbying muscle from none other than regulatory-hurdle-smashing consulting firm, Chemrisk—brainchild of Dennis Paustenbach. (You may remember Paustenbach from the Wall Street Journal article exposing his role in ghost writing a bogus study on the chromium toxicity.)

Silly season roundup
Since I posted about McLaren driver options for next season, I figure I might as well try and get all the silly-season stories out of the way in one go:
Mark Webber: He has stated time and time again that he wants to stick with Williams. I'm not really sure why he's so keen to stay at Williams. I mean it's a team with a great herritage and outside the manufacturer-backed teams it's the best place to be right now. But if you had the chance to join Renault next year, surely you'd take that wouldn't you? OK, there's some romance for Webber at Williams because Alan Jones won his World Championship there and it also has a fellow Aussie as Technical Director in Sam Michael. But compared to the team that has all the momentum right now? All the more strange is that Webber is managed by Flavio Briatore and had a testing role at Renault before his Minardi->Janguar->Williams adventure.
Finnish driver Heikki Kovalainen seems almost certain to get one of the seats at Renault in 2007. He was runner up to Nico Rosberg in the 2005 GP2 season and is currently the team's 3rd driver. That leaves the other seat - Renault could extend Fisichella's contract or hire a current driver - it seems unlikely they'd run another rookie alongside Kovalainen. Possible signings include Webber (as mentioned above) and Kimi Raikkonen. A few months ago Flavio dismissed the chances of Renault signing Raikkonen in what would be a straight swap for Alonso with McLaren. Since then though senior figures at the Renault parent company have said that they are willing to pay to sign a "top driver". Well there's no chance of Michael Schumacher effectively returning to his old team, so that only really leaves Raikkonen, unless you have a relaxed definition of "top driver".
The speculation of the last week has been that Ferrari are in talks to sign David Coulthard for 2007. What was originally just paddock talk became full-on rumour-mill material when DC refused to discuss it in a press conference at the British Grand Prix. At first sight it seems pretty fanciful that the driver who looked like he might be out of the sport altogether after McLaren dropped him, would now be in line for a seat at Ferrari. But he has done a solid job for Red Bull and without Klien or Liuzzi scoring many points, they must be glad they signed him. He has experience with the Ferrari engine this year (not that I think that really counts for much) and seems to get along well with Schumacher these days (taking the heat off him with the GPDA for example). If Ferrari can't get the signature of Kimi Raikkonen for 2007 or if Schumacher retires, they could certainly do a lot worse (by retaining Felipe Massa for example).
Then there is the thorny subject of Jacques Villeneuve... In an in-depth interview with Autosport.com, Dave Richards rehashes the whole Villeneuve debacle for the umpteenth time (and yes, he's as bored of telling the story as we are of hearing it). Richards claims that with JV's contract accounting for such a large percentage of BAR's budget and the BAT directors wanting him to get the team in order ahead of a possible sale, he made JV an offer that he could refuse: Stay a BAR driver in 2004 but we won't pay you any more than what we're already paying your for the years up to 2004. He was effectively asking JV to drive for free (plus some expenses and bonuses). Unsurprisingly JV refused, thinking he'd easily get a better offer elsewhere. History records of course that not only did he not get a drive elsewhere, but he also as a result missed out of the change to take many podiums (and collect the bonuses for them) in what would be BAR/Honda's best year to date.
Peter Sauber signed JV to a two-year contract for start of 2005 and then sold his team to BMW at the end of that year. There was plenty of talk before the start of the season about whether BMW would honor the contract and keep JV this year. In the end it doesn't look like they had much choice and it's just as well - after enduring a tough 2005, JV has done an excellent job in the BMW-Sauber this year. There remains every possibility that BMW will sign JV for an additional year even though they seem keen to promote current 3rd driveer Robert Kubica to the main place alongside Nick Heidfeld (who's already under contract for 2007). If JV doesn't stay at BMW, there is a lot of speculation that he will go to Toyota to replace a retiring Jarno Trulli. Ralf Schumacher is still on a long-term contract there.
Juan-Pablo Montoya's manager has, we are told, been frantically looking for a full-time drive for him next year. McLaren are almost certain to drop him even if Kimi does leave as expected. Renault don't seem particularly interested. Ferrari likewise. BMW already have drivers vying for seats. Williams are sorted unless Webber decides to leave, but they won't take Montoya back and Montoya wouldn't crawl back to Williams as long as Sam Michael is still employed by them. Red Bull and STR have their own stable of drivers. Honda have two drivers under contract. MF1 and Super Aguri are a fate worse than death. That just leaves Toyota which would leave JV and Montoya fighting for the seat alongside Ralf Schumacher. I'm not sure which one I'd pick out of those two personally.
I'm not sure what will happen to Giancarlo Fisichella if Renault drop him as I expect. There seems to be a dichotomy in modern F1 where there are a few drivers the teams would pay millions to have and then the rest of the seats are filled by "the next big thing". There aren't many seats available for journeymen like Fisichella anymore. It's hard to feel sorry for him - he will have had a championship winning car for two seasons at the end of this year and if he's only won a few races, well, he can't blame it all on bad luck. He seems too young to retire (although now I look it up, he is a year older than me!), so maybe he'll get a 3rd driver role somewhere, but my personal feeling is that he won't be racing next season.
Speaking of Fisichella, this isn't really silly-season news, but I'll stick it here as it doesn't really deserve a post all of it's own: He has today started a legal action against Eddie Jordan over money he claims he was owed from his time there in the 2003 and 2004 seasons. It's interesting that he's sueing Jordan the man instead of Jordan the team, now Midland F1 of course. I don't think anyone needs reminding that Eddie was on the plaintiff side the last time he visited the high courts where his case against Vodafone was thrown out, but not before he received a verbal dressing down from the judge.

A hoarder pinned under piles of things needed to be rescued in Canada. On Jan. 15, Mail Online reported that a 76-year-old Canadian man spent two days trapped under piles of junk. A man called police and said that he had not heard from his relative in days. He was "severely dehydrated" when authorities responded to the concerned call.
"Officials who responded to the scene found the doorway and halls of the man's home blocked with mounds of rubbish requiring help from firefighters. Crews were forced to break down the door and clear a path with a chainsaw to reach the homeowner trapped inside. Police said there was no heat or electricity, and the elderly victim was severely dehydrated," Mail Online reported.
The hoarder pinned under piles of junk was said to be suffering from mental health issues. His home had floor-to-ceiling piles of things -- rubbish, debris, and boxes of junk. Every room on both floors of the man's home was covered with "stuff," much of it not sounding very valuable at all.
Many hoarders don't necessarily "collect" things but refuse to throw things away. It doesn't matter if it is trash or broken items, hoarders just keep piling things in their homes and it doesn't take long for things to get out of control. This condition is not something that is easily overcome either.
The hoarder pinned under piles of junk is expected to be okay. He may lose his leg as it was stuck under debris and lost circulation for days. Sadly, authorities admitted that if first responders didn't find him, he probably wouldn't have made it.

Miley Cyrus hasn't been too open about her marriage to Liam Hemsworth when asked about it during interviews. In fact, the public seems to have concluded that the two are indeed married because of the rings that she wears and comments her father has made. However, if they are married, things could be going downhill for the couple. For one, Liam was caught at a hotel with January Jones just last month and now Miley has been spotted without her ring. To top it all off, Liam jumped on a plane to go visit his brother in Australia, hinting that things are not good with them. According to a new Wetpaint Entertainment report released on Mar. 9, Miley Cyrus has been left home alone as Liam takes some time to think while visiting his brother Chris Hemsworth in Australia.
“Liam did fly home [to Australia on March 1] so they could have a break," a source says. “Miley is still upset with Liam," a source reveals, adding that Miley isn't wearing her ring. "She took the ring off to make him mad." And it sounds like the story with January Jones was just the beginning. “Miley is crazy about Liam, but sometimes doesn't treat him great," a source has said. "She likes things her way and tends to play games. Liam is also a strong person, and that's why they often butt heads." Of course, Miley often spends time in the studio with her friends, so one can imagine that she may not be treating Liam as he wants.
Are you surprised that this married couple is already having troubles? Do you think Liam did the rigth thing in going to Australia after he was caught with January Jones in a hotel?

Take a look at the guy in the 7 of cups card. What’s going on with him, really? This image seems a little unearthly, a little surreal. Something beyond the ordinary and mundane world is going on here. The figure in this card has his head in the clouds. He is lost in imagination. He is dreaming. Is this the best thing for him, does he need to come back down to earth?
7 of cups can indicate a healthy and alive imagination. This can be very healing. There are many answers to the universe that can be found when you step away from rational and logical thought. Sometimes this is the best thing we can do for ourselves. Stepping away from rationality can reveal secret and hidden aspects of the universe, ourselves, or a situation that we do not otherwise see.
Be a dreamer. Stick your heads in the clouds. Live in a fantasy world. Sometimes we need to have our feet on the ground, this is true. Sometimes we do need to be practical and real. Sometimes though, it’s best to forget that idea. Explore the world of “Could Be.” In the World of Could Be, we see the real true contents of our heart. Without the restrictions of “what really is” we can figure out what it is we really want. Once we figure out what we really want, we begin the task of manifestation. So go beyond any and all limiting thoughts. Go crazy with what your real true desires are. There are no boundaries and there are no limitations. Put your head in the clouds and explore your heart’s desire.
While doing this, though, it is important to keep our feet on the ground. Stay rooted. Stay grounded. It is easy to get lost in our own thoughts and imagination and feel like we’ve drifted away. There is divinity in the imagination. However, we are beings of the earth. This is why we must stay grounded. Why do you think we have gravity? Why do you think we are in human form? To utilize what we find in the imagination, we must be planted firmly on the earth. Be as a tree with deep roots that grows tall. Have a firm foundation with high and lofty ideals.
Having your head in the clouds, sometimes, can be the best place for it. Dream. Fantasize. Imagine. Visualize the most ideal situation for yourself. We all need to do this. Sometimes though, you really do need to come down to earth and pay attention to the practical matters of your life. Plant your feet on the ground and root in. Strong roots make for a strong foundation. The stronger your roots, the higher you are able to hold your head. Find balance between the world of fantasy and the practical matters of earthly life. This is to be strong. This is to appreciate what both worlds have to offer in equal measure. Gaining this balance allows for the blending and sharing of the best of both worlds.
When the 7 of cups comes up for you in a reading, use it as an invitation to take stock of your dreams. What is honestly important to you? What can you, as an earthly being, do to manifest these things? Are you “lost in the clouds??” Or are you grounded? Be mindful to maintain a sense of groundedness as you pursue your hopes and dreams.

Support the move to replace our corporate and personal income tax code with a national consumption-based tax.
Why?
Because it will be far simpler than the current sclerotic byzantine income-based tax structure that has been in place since 1913. It will return the United States to the preferred tax revenue-generation method favored by our Founders who thought a tax on someone's income could be capricious and ruinous to a person's freedom and productivity.
They were right on the 'capricious' part.
Most of all, it would be a far better measure of someone's use of all the freedoms and accoutrements of our publicly-supported infrastructure and telecommunications networks in America. The more someone consumes, the more they need a solid defense and homeland security to protect their ability to do so, correct?
We are not that concerned about 'the rich' not paying 'their fair share' simply because the facts of the matter show quite clearly that they already are paying a huge share of federal income taxes each year. The top 1% pay 42%+ of all income taxes as it is today; the top 5% pay 59%%; the top 10% pay 71%.
That is enough for us. What should the top 1% pay, 100% of all taxes so the rest of us don't pay a dime to live in this free country?
When you think about it, the very wealthy and rich do a lot of business and transactions every single day. They buy and sell businesses before most of us wake up in the morning. They buy a new mansion every year it seems if you pay any attention to People magazine. Throw in a few hundred thousand stock trades and 10 new Mazeratis each year on top of the jewelry and bling-bling they seem to sport on themselves, well, you have got a virtual cash machine if you plop a consumption.transaction tax on each and every purchase.
'What do you mean?' you might be thinking. 'Are you saying that the federal government should get a 15% upfront tax on every home that is sold each year in America?'
Precisely. We are saying that those who purchase a lot of things, which would include the afore-mentioned 'rich', would pay a 15% transaction tax on every single thing they purchase each year. As a result, they would pay far, far more in tax than someone who doesn't make a lot of transactions.
Think about it. How many stock trades does a poor person make each year? 45% of all Americans don't own any stock at all. They will not ever pay any consumption tax on any stock trade, leveraged buyout, credit default swap, derivative or any other financial vehicle that has caused the economy such grief over the past 4 years.
How many homes do moderate-income folks buy? 1 in a lifetime if they are fortunate.
How many cars? Maybe one every 10 years and most likely a used one at that. Let the rich guy pay the 15% tax on the full price of a $40,000 car in year 1. The moderate-income person can then buy it used for $19,000 several years later and pay the tax again on his/her purchase.
'What about food and the essentials of life, fella?' some of the more socially-conscious folk might have churning in their brains right about now.
How about them? Why not exempt the mere basics of life for everyone, namely fresh food from the grocery store, prescription drugs and perhaps a few other necessities in life that everyone uses and can agree upon?
However, not the food purchased in restaurants and fast-food joints. Super-Gulps and Whoppers surely need to be taxed since they are so unhealthy for people and have contributed mightily to the Obesitification of America over the last 40 years. They are most definitely not 'necessities' of life no matter how much we might like them.
We tried to ask the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis in Washington for some information detailing the consumption patterns of Americans by income quintile. The analyst from the BEA got back to us in a matter of minutes (so there is a case of an enterprising federal public servant) and said that there was no such data available from the federal government.
Perhaps there is some private sector data that can be found to ascertain just how much economic activity is conducted by the rich people on down the economic totem pole. It stands to reason that wealthier people buy more stuff each and every year, doesn't it? If they don't want to pay the tax, then they can save their money and invest it in a new technology or enterprise that will hire the rest of us and provide more jobs with more income and benefits (if there will be any in the post-Obamacare apocalyptic world, that is)
We might be getting a real-live petri dish experiment of whether this will work or not in the good Old North State of North Carolina. About 1 week from now, newly-elected Republican Governor Pat McCrory and super-majorities for the Republicans in both sides of the state legislature in Raleigh will be sworn into office.
They will be considering replacing the state corporate and personal income tax with a stepped-up excise tax. If passed, North Carolina would become an income tax-free zone for new business and enterprise to pop up or move here from a high tax state such as California which is apparently a real basket-case on the order of Greece today.
If passed, North Carolina will join only 2 other states without corporate or personal income taxes, Wyoming and Nevada. North Carolina will even exceed the statutes of states such as Florida and Texas in terms of tax freedom, both of which have long been considered havens of tax free investment and entrepreneurial activity.
North Carolina might become the bellweather state in terms of showing how and if a new steamlined tax system can help generate vibrant new economic activity. With a 9.4 unemployment rate, 4th highest in the nation, why not try something different to get out of these economic doldrums?
Taxing transactions rather than income makes a whole lot of sense. Rich people might even pay more in taxes, not less.

When it comes to treating their fans well nobody does it better then Anthrax. To thank their fans for their support of the Big Four and Worship Music the band has released a six song cover EP called Anthems, which pays tribute to the bands that have influenced them the most.
Joey Belladonna steals the show on Anthems. You don’t know how versatile he is until you hear the whole record. The EP opens strong with Rush’s “Anthem.” Joey sounds exactly like a young Geddy Lee. It’s remarkable. One would’ve thought Geddy was singing on the record. Another strong vocal outing from Joey was Boston’s “Smokin’,” where the band captures the sound of seventies arena rock then filters it via their trademark speed and heaviness. That heaviness comes into play again on Thin Lizzy’s “Jailbreak” where Joey’s voice takes a deeper turn with the bluesy groove.
Anthems is Anthrax's love letter to the music that shaped them into the band they are today. Despite being only six songs in length it packs a powerful punch. While you may wish the band chose different songs, you can't deny after listening to this record that the band does a stellar job on the tracks they've chosen. They've made these songs Anthrax songs, and when you're talking about bands like Rush, AC/DC, Thin Lizzy, Cheap Trick, Journey, and Boston, that's saying a lot. If you love Anthrax, Anthems is a must listen. Definitely check it out.

Monday January 9, 2002
Phoned Ioana in New York and asked her: “If we found the money and started a magazine in Berlin, would you be in?” Her answer was a bold: “YES. When? I’m booking my ticket right away!” M and I have plans. We’re three now. And what if it were the beginning of something…?
A few weeks ago I unearthed this entry in a diary I had no memory of keeping at the time. A discarded ‘slice’ of life, jotted on a random page of an old notebook, crammed between to-do lists and my Moscow journalism shorthand notes. Little did I know, this random scribble would actually be worth mentioning 10 years later, as a milestone, a piece of history that would affect not only my life but also that of quite a few fellow Berliners – destined to become our readers, contributors or staff.
Over the years we'd fight over whose idea Exberliner was, who was to reap the credit (when being interviewed by appreciative journalists) or to be blamed when everything went so wrong, so many times. There’s no simple answer!
‘M’ stood for Maurice. He was the forerunner, the first ‘Berliner’ of the trio. With German blood and German tongue, he had made it to the new capital before everyone, before the idealistic masses of what we were later to dub ‘yukis’, before his high school friends who were to follow suit later, even before the euro. Following half a life in the US and a journalism degree in the London of his birth, Maurice had settled in Berlin nicely and was already getting sick of working for other people (Die Welt online and Deutsche Welle TV).
Founding a magazine had always been an 'Ioana-Idea'. Born and raised in Ceauşescu’s Romania, she had fled with her family to the West and spent her student life between the 'little Romania' of her two-room Parisian flat and the Sorbonne's department of political science where she and I had met 10 years before.
After London (all three of us went through City University journalism school), she had made it to NYC, the land of her dissident father's dreams of freedom. She had cried flying over the Statue of Liberty (and would cry later looking at the Wall on Bernauer Straße). She witnessed 9/11 with her own eyes.
Yet she was growing tired of New York – the Village Voice where she worked was already not quite what it used to be – and had set her sights on launching a magazine in Paris, a bad idea if I ever heard one.
I had just passed through my Heimat and sealed my decision to not go back: too much had remained the good old boring same since I had left the benches of the Sorbonne to teach and pursue my PhD in Moscow.
Berlin was different, open, unfinished, literally a building site. So, I unpacked my suitcase here as a mournful but grateful exile – a refugee from Putin’s Russia and his FSB Black List of undesirables. After years of loving the kick of intrepid journalism – from war to investigation on chemical weapons, from Chechnya to Moscow, from field reporting to the desk of a major news agency – I had to move on.
Faced with the choice of a career move (back to old Paris) and l-o-v-e (Berlin, terra incognita), I foolishly and rather unfashionably opted for the latter – the riskiest gamble of all.
My first few months here were agony: too comfortable to enjoy, too cheap and easy to be true; my freelancing for a few culture mags felt indulgent – I had risked my life in Russia, now I was losing my sanity. So when an acquaintance suggested that, with our combined experience, we should start Berlin’s much-needed English magazine and that he would be interested in investing some money in it – it did not fall on deaf ears…
From then on, things went too fast to be remembered.
(I couldn’t find any more discarded diary entries to help – with the exception of a paragraph on my decision to cancel a much anticipated hunting trip to Kazakhstan: "My resolution to dedicate myself to our new publishing project is at stake. I've got to be able to make choices – even if it hurts…")
On March 5, Ioana landed at Tegel with a newly acquired American accent and her legendary indomitable faith and headstrong energy. (To my dismay, her only concern was finding a good gym here.) We left to meet our two business partners in the horse-breeding town of Verden in Lower Saxony on the same day.
Here, in the lobby of an unmemorable hotel, serious talks were held, contracts signed, making us the happy managers of one IoMauNa Media GmbH. We left the hotel heavily indebted but in good spirits. We owned a publishing house! Many a journalist's dream – having one's own paper – was becoming our reality.
A month, later we moved into our first office, a two-room shop front on Prenzlauer Berg's drab Jablonskistraße, which we promptly furnished with basics from Ikea and three computers (not a single Mac!).
Maurice, who was the only one who spoke German and had a vague idea of what a Gewerbeschein was, took over business operations; Ioana, who hadn’t practiced design since journalism school but was confident she could do it, art direction; I, 'naturally', reclined into my new chief editor’s chair – an editor without writers, with the notable exception of Robin Alexander, a young German journo I had met in Moscow and who instantly accepted the position of political columnist.
Our start-up team was soon to be fleshed out by Richard, a multitalented German-bred American who was to help raise the infant paper until it could walk by itself, and Rosie, a tiny energetic Brit who ruled over the listings and whose high spirits and fortitude we missed sorely when she had to return home a year later.
The ad sales squad was an all-Berliner duo – a skinny, cat-loving film intellectual called Sven and André, a fifty-something bon vivant recently laid off by the Tagesspiegel. Chance encounters provided the rest of the crew: we met our music editor at a sidewalk café up the street, and our (shy) first film critic was escorted to our Jablonskistraße office by her brother. I don't remember worrying much about writers: we were journalists, after all; never did it occur to us back then this would actually be a problem.
A magazine is a business, not a sandbox for journalists.
Market realities command that successful magazine start-ups be the brainchild of marketing minds and design geniuses – looks and sales are the one and only decisive factor in this war. We were charmingly unaware of such simple truths. When our benevolent but pragmatic investor asked for a “business plan”, we'd rushed to the nearest bookstore to get up to speed on balance sheets and the difference between cash flow and a cash cow.
All I knew about business came from my partial reading of Das Kapital; Ioana was, well, a Romanian… Maurice had escaped the bright business future his family had in store for him to study English literature. Our revenue projections were shamelessly optimistic. Cluelessness has its advantages: it doesn't burden you with paralysing thoughts. Plus we wanted to be different. And reality was to leave us with no other choice.
Over the years we’ve learnt about the publishing industry the hard way: learning by doing and suffering: fiascos and shitstorms, lawsuits and scandals. Here are a few milestones on the road towards what we are today.
How we got our weird name
On June 10, 2002, following a long and laborious birth, a 32-page free newspaper named The Berliner saw the light of day – 30,000 of them! It’s hard to remember what we felt. Tired, probably.
What we do remember though is that within two days of distributing the first issue, we received a wake-up call in the guise of a cease and desist letter from a lawyer. The name ‘Berliner’ had been registered as a trademark by another magazine. A few days later our rather dishevelled, exhausted trio was sitting in a Ku’damm attorney’s office across from a Herr Moshkovits, the publisher of a lifestyle glossy named Berliner which happened to be starting up at the same time to fold only a year or two later.
Made compliant by the threat of a €10,000 fine, we agreed to immediately change the name of the magazine. Freshly hyphenated, The Ex-Berliner was born. (It was almost a year later, when the new Berlin branch of Neville Brody’s Research Studios redesigned the mag, that the name was compressed into a unitary EXBERLINER.)
How we learnt to say no to advertorials
Sometimes it was fate rather than lawyers that taught us a lesson in survival in the harsh world of publishing. While our naïve belief that we would be profitable within two issues and advertisers would flock to our free cultural newspaper in English was charming – finding capable ad reps who could reel in financially solvent clients who actually paid their bills turned out to be much harder than we expected.

Tips on Flying with Kayaks to Chile
From Guide
Flying with a Kayak to Chile
Flying with a kayak to Chile is a "do-able" proposition even on airlines that claim they will not take kayaks. In the best case scenario kayaks can be checked in as baggage with no addition fees. Most often an excess/oversized baggage fee will be charged in both directions for flying your kayak in and out of South America. In the worst case scenario you may get denied by the airline check-in attendant if they follow the airline policy strictly.
1] It is important to find out EXACTLY what the policy is of the airline you will be flying regarding transporting kayaks. Some airlines even have different baggage policies and charges from airport to airport; you need to know these also. The official airline policy will be your WORST CASE scenario. In the event that you run into a check-in attendant who follows the rules you need to be prepared to pay the extra charge, get denied or opt to not take your kayak.
2] If you decide to take your kayak with you we have had the best luck wrapping them up or putting them in a surfboard bag. The idea is to be DISCRETE and allow the check-in attendant a wide amount of latitude about taking your kayak. Be polite as possible and ask them to HELP YOU with getting your boat to South America. Be careful about stowing excess baggage in your kayak as it can put you over some of the airline weight limits. Remember there are different baggage allowances for domestic and international flights. It is also helpful to inform the airline that you will be taking a "surf board" with you when you make your reservation. If this is on the computer when you check-in your kayak is more likely to get through. Try to avoid using the word "kayak" when you interact with airline personnel.
3] It is best to check things straight through. Each time you have to manually check your kayak in for a flight you risk running into a desk attendant who will follow the airline rules. Try to limit these interactions as much as possible. In the worst case scenario you may need to pay another fee in both directions to transport your kayak domestically in Chile or the United States. For this reason many paddlers choose to rent a vehicle in Santiago or take a public bus (which takes kayaks) to their domestic destination.
4] Get the airline policy in WRITING and CARRY IT WITH YOU. If the airline policy says that they will take a kayak, you will want a copy of that so that you do not get denied by an employee in South America or charged an additional fee. You will also want to save all of your baggage check-in tickets for the same reason.
5] Most of us leave our kayaks in South America after our trip by selling them to the locals who want the latest boats. This solves the reverse problem of getting your kayak back to your hometown. Usually the South American check-in attendants are stricter than those in North America about charging extra fees. However, in recent years Chilean buyers have gotten access to the latest kayaks directly through the manufacturers, so they are becoming more selective about what they buy. Be prepared to offer a good deal, especially if you don't have the latest design. In the worst case scenario you may not be able to sell an older model boat.
6] If you call the airline and "get the okay" for your boats DON'T BELIEVE what you hear (unless it is in writing). Things are often different at the check-in counter. They may say no on the phone but will take them when you arrive at the airport. Likewise they could say yes on the phone but get denied at check-in.
7] Have a Plan B ready if something happens, like an emergency rental or purchase option in Chile should something go wrong.
8] Sometimes taking a new boat into South America can be a "customs problem" if they think you will be leaving it there. If you are planning on taking a new boat, take off all sales tags and make it look as "used as possible". You don't want to be charged a customs fee. We don't recommend taking new boats for this reason.
9] We have had bad luck (with timing) flying kayaks into Chile using Air Cargo. Usually the air freighters don't coordinate with your arrival and departure times and arrive at different terminals. The problems involved in retrieving your kayak and getting it checked to your domestic flight usually make keeping on schedule impossible. Don't consider this option unless you have plenty of time.
10] If you are planning an excursion to Argentina the customs officials will note your kayak when you take it over the border. If you re-cross the border back into Chile you will need to have the kayak with you. Argentina has a Luxury Tax on kayaks and the officials want to make sure you don't leave it in the country.

Don't get me started on Australian Immigration .. or US immigration ..
If you are shocked at such questions, me, in my humble words, says .. well, you got off easy ..
You should have demanded she explain the need for such a question .. and see what would have transpired .. on top of it .. when you say you been to Malaysia a couple of times, in local terms, that is known as "Visa Runs" and a lot of people do it for legit and illegitimate purposes ..
As for what laws you have broken or not .. well, I can safely say, Singapore is at the Crossroads in Asia, and, for a start, human trafficking is Immigration's primary concern .. if not into Singapore, it is Via Singapore .. I am not going to get into the details .. so the immigration, as per law, has the right to ask what you are doing here .. as one girl was asked the same question, and she went "I am here to study the culture of Singapore .. " pat came the reply "you been to Singapore for more than 60 days, there is not much you can study about the culture .. your entry is refused .. " - of course, the ICA officer could ask whether is she part timing, or doing other stuff - which is what they cannot ask or accuse - and they have to make a decision ..
The law says the immigration has every right to vet you - especially in Singapore, considering that a fair amount of Foreigners do engage in activities not allowed under the law, when you are on a visit visa - including working, running businesses, consulting .. oh, I can easily say Westerners are NOT exempt from such activities ..
I know a handful of guys, who cannot be bothered to get proper work pass, to run their businesses here, and instead, base themselves in KL and fly down and exit to extend the visa - and it is not like ICA doesn't profile them ..
Sorry if I am long winded, but it amuses me, when Europeans get 'shocked' or 'amazed' and 'annoyed' or 'irritated' .. when Immigration asks questions .. try taking an Asian to Europe or US, and see .. you will be humbled ..
Oh, there is a TV program - on Australian border Police .. take a sneak peek, and see how visitors get treated ..
Border Security - Watch full episodes - PLUS7 - Yahoo!7
PS: the law says you must show proof of return - so you can decipher it as any way you want - all the way to 'staring down the young immigration girls who don't know how to respect people .. ' ..
No offense ..
I can see where you're coming from; no offence but a good reminder though I have been simply sailing through the borders in Europe ( ticketless ), Australia ( return airfare ), SG
( O/W air ticket).It was some time since I went to the US but it was cool there too. So I was shocked when the young ICA at the JB causeway asked what I was going to do on my return to SG ( same day visit too ) and I told her so. I didn't think that was funny for I was with my family and surely she didn't think I was going to rob the bank and colonise Sg!
But judging from the gist of what I've read through this thread, things have changed , perhaps drastically so.
We normally sail through between France and the Uk too, but once, in 2009, the customs guy ( the same guy who sent us off very nicely to Calais on a 5 day trip ) asked where we were coming from on our return. It occurred to me it was so obvious we'd returned from France that I decided to be cheeky and said, " from China." The old guy was so annoyed, he marched us into the checking area and we had to wait for a long time while they slowly looked into our shopping bags and the car boot.
On a more serious note regarding visitor's visa and employment- I don't think there's any prohibition on anyone seeking work while on a visitor's visa in Sg as long as their skills/qualifications are needed by an Sg firm or institution and they haven't overstayed the date stamped on the passport when they get the work pass from MOM. Once you have the post after the interview, the employer applies the WP for you and MOM issues it; all legit.

Cyber Threats Grow in Enormous Proportion
Cyber attacks are no longer limited to petty thieves stealing laptops or hacking into a server to extract sensitive data.
Cyber intruders are now threatening our national security. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta issued a call to arms last month against cyber attacks on U.S. targets.
Panetta said the Pentagon must be able to defend the nation against potential cyber attackers, according to NBC news. Panetta, speaking to business executives in New York, said cyber intruders have already gained access to some of the country’s computer systems that run chemical, electric and water plants. These cyber criminals have every intention of causing panic, destruction and even the loss of lives, he added.
With an annual budget of about $3 billion for cyber security, Panetta says more needs to be done to create an army of cyber warriors to confront the immediate and growing cyber threats facing the nation.
Panetta’s remarks came just weeks after America’s largest banks were attacked by an international hacktivist group. The group launched denial of service attacks against the banks, shutting down their websites for hours at a time. The hacktivists, known as Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters, issued a statement saying the attacks were in retaliation to a YouTube video that insulted many Muslims. These attacks typically flood a website or network with so much traffic that it shuts down. They can last anywhere from hours to days.
But cyber attacks aren’t just aimed at the Pentagon, utilities and banks. They threaten every industry, in every industrialized nation, on the globe. The fact is that no organization – regardless of how large or small – is immune from cyber criminal attacks, denial of service attacks, vicious malware, cyber extortion and cyber espionage.
Is your organization prepared to ward off a cyber attack? Click here for helpful cyber security tips that can help protect your organization from cyber threats.

Wolwedans Dune Camp
Wolwedans Dune Camp is the simpler and more economical sister camp to the lovely Wolwedans Dune Lodge and the luxurious Boulders Camp. A favourite of ours, Dune Camp sits on the edge of a 250m-high dune on the 2,100km2 NamibRand Nature Reserve, within the Namib Desert.
Our view of Wolwedans Dune Camp
Wolwedans Dune Camp has a rustic charm and relaxed atmosphere, suited to the more adventurous traveller. This is coupled with the attentive but not overbearing care given by the staff, making every guest feel special. Of course the surrounding scenery speaks for itself but, in our opinion, this is first-class simplicity in the desert!

My question involves real estate located in the State of: IL
I bought my house 9 years ago. The previous owners of my house supposedly built a retaining wall on my neighbor's property (supposedly received my neighbor's permission to build). My neighbor told me this last year, but now is denying it. They are saying the entire wall in on their property. To know for sure we will need to have a survey done. The last 10 to 15 feet of the wall curves in about 2 feet further in on their property. It was like this when I moved into the house. (I don't have pictures of this and don't know if any exist.) I don't have any plans to fight them on this and they are not asking me to remove the entire wall, but the last 10 to 15 feet. They want me to make it straight as they thought it was originally. They are accusing my brother & cousin (who was doing my yard work) of moving this wall. They never touched this wall. My other cousin was also present (not doing any work) which can testify that they did not touch this wall, but only the weeds surrounding it. During the past week, my neighbor knocked over many of the bricks that was part of this retaining wall. Many of these rocks are now on my property. I would like to resolve this without us having to go to court. I am afraid if I touch this wall, then she will come after me for her property washing away. The dirt has to go somewhere. If they want to remove this wall, I am OK with it. If the dirt falls on my property, then I am OK with some free dirt. I am not that difficult of a neighbor and very easy going. If they say this is their property in which it is probably so, then please take it and take what is on it. My boss at work suggested that I call my title company and the city for them to make a ruling (this is apparently free). Any legal advice on how I should handle this situation would be very helpful.

Minnesota Snow Sports
Minnesota offers plenty of fun on the snow, from snowshoeing in the woods to the adventure of a dogsled trip.

is probably due to seasonal needle drop. Deciduous trees, such as maple and ash, drop all of their leaves in fall. Though it largely goes unnoticed, evergreens also lose a portion of their foliage (needles) on a yearly basis. Seasonal needle drop on most evergreens occurs in fall. Needle loss is most noticeable on white pines. As much as one-half of the needles on white pines may drop in early fall. Seasonal needle loss is less noticeable on spruces, firs and other pines as they retain a higher percentage of their needles. Seasonal needle drop is uniformly distributed throughout the inner part of the evergreen. It is the oldest needles which are shed. The needles turn uniformly yellow or brown and drop to the ground.
Why does fall leaf color on trees vary from year to year?
The weather in early fall largely determines the intensity and duration of leaf color in those tree species capable of producing good fall color. Best fall color typically develops when days in early fall are sunny and mild and nights are cool (but remain above freezing). Long periods of cloudy, rainy weather or a hard freeze in early fall will mute fall colors..

Japanese Photobooks Now in the summer of 2011—but it is the first time that they have devoted their entire space to an exhibition of books. Following this show they will be hosting the 5th International Fotobook Festival, which is traditionally held in Kassel, so it seems that photobooks are becoming one of the major areas of focus of their programme.
According to Martin Parr, Latin-American photobooks “are the best kept secret in the history of photography”… one of the many secrets that are being steadily revealed by Parr and/or Aperture through The Photobook: A History series, Japanese Photobooks of the 1960s and ’70s and a forthcoming book on Chinese photobooks that Parr is doing with WassinkLundgren chez Aperture. The ‘books on books’ phenomenon is gaining so much traction that Andreas Schmidt, a pleasingly disruptive photobook maker, is already looking forward to the book on books on books which surely can’t be too far away. As for Parr’s quote, I am willing to take his word for it, knowing absolutely nothing about Latin-Amercian photobooks (with a few Mexican exceptions) and having had very few opportunities to see any.
I was particularly interested to see how Le Bal would take on this subject. Although there appears to be a growing trend for exhibiting books, the ones I have seen so far have generally been disappointing. Books are not an easy thing to exhibit, in fact they are exhibition-resistant in my view. Most people’s preferred position for reading or looking at books is sitting down and they are generally consumed by one person at a time, things that are difficult to replicate in an exhibition context. Exhibitions do not encourage visitors to touch the works on display, making it difficult to display more than one spread, something which is painfully reductive unless multiple copies of each book displayed can be tracked down. I think the key in exhibiting books is in overcoming these obstacles by recreating the immersive experience of a book in a way that goes beyond the experience of going into a very good bookstore.
In addition to the basic difficulties of exhibiting books, Le Bal’s space is far from huge whereas Latin America is on the large side and presumably has produced a decent number of interesting photobooks over the years. This poses the additional challenge of avoiding the exhibition equivalent of a ‘best of’ compilation album. To borrow the strapline from a random ‘Best of Latin America’ compilation, this could have been “a lively exhibition filled with hot and spicy Latin American photoboks!” which would probably have given me a severe case of indigestion.
Thankfully the exhibition successfully avoids most of these pitfalls. Rather than structuring the exhibition around individual countries, it is broken up into a series of sections: history and propaganda, urban photography, photographic essays, artist books, literature and photography, and contemporary books. These categories go beyond the traditional bounds of the photobook, expanding its definition to something like ‘books that contain photography,’ which makes the terrain far more diverse and interesting, bringing in books such as the revolutionary propaganda tome, Sartre Visite a Cuba (1960) or Auto-photos (1978) an artist book documenting a performance. There is enough material in each of the sections to whet the appetite, but without requiring you to spend several hours in the exhibition space just to cover all the material on display.
The scénographie of Foto/Gráfica is particularly good, the best I have seen for a photobook exhibition. Firstly, in order to tackle the issue of displaying more than one spread from each book, the organizers have decided to go down the road of sacrifice and cut the books up so that a series of spreads can be displayed (there are clearly enough copies of these books to spare, as book-surgery is not the kind of thing that could be done with an exhibition of rare Japanese photobooks for example). The books are displayed in a variety of different ways, from ‘classic’ glass display cases, to superimposed custom shelving units hanging on the walls. The exhibition also makes good use of prints, which are exhibited alongside the books and are a useful reminder of how different these media are. In the downstairs space, the central wall has been covered with scans of the spreads from a single book with a handful of prints displayed in mounts floating on the surface, a very impressive display. I’m posting a few of the official installation views with this post, as my crappy iPhone shots would not do the exhibition justice. By deconstructing the books in these different ways, it makes the viewer think about the form of the book and its specific qualities.
The success of Foto/Gráfica is that it opens itself out beyond Latin American photography to engage with Latin American artistic culture more broadly. By giving politics, literature and other art forms center stage, the exhibition not only provides some much-needed context, but opens up a number of interesting paths of inquiry. Photobook lovers won’t need my encouragement to go and see this, but this is one for those that are not book geeks as well. After Paris, the exhibition is travelling to Ivory Press in Madrid, Aperture in New York and to the Museo del Libro y de la Lengua in Buenos-Aires.

Hi Everyone,
I have been using Money Corp to change my sterling to euros for the past year,
In a thread (that I can no longer find) a couple of months ago I read about a different company that offered a better rate. I looked into it at the time and found this to be true, unfortunateley, however, I can not remember the name of this company (It's an age thing!!!!).
Can anyone help by telling me who they use and about their experiences?
Thanks
Spam post or Abuse? Please let us know
I have used Money Corp previously for stage payments on our quad on phase 2.
For short visits to Spain I have used Crown Currency Exchange and at the moment the rate is 1.1865 for home delivery 28.09.09 - 11.12.09.
We will need to make our final payment on our quad soon so will be very interested to read the answers to your question.
Currency direct ?????
We use HIFX to transfer smaller amounts to cover the mortgage etc and to draw out when we are in Spain for spending. You can set up an online account with them and then do it yourself from home and providing you transfer over £500 you get a good rate (better than going to Intercash). The money is in your Spanish bank account within 3-4 working days.
Hope this helps

hello all
I have an agency with Currencies Direct and they will make the whole process very simple for you,
they offer top rates and some of their transfers like their regular payment plan are done for free,
they offer fixed rate future contracts which can protect you from currency fluctuations which may be perfect for house completions,
if I give them your details they will make the contact with you, if you wish to avail of their services PM me with your contact details and I´ll do the rest
one more thing, they even have a reasonably local office( La Zenia)
Hi,
I used Currency Direct when paying my final payment on our Penthouse. You should be able to negoiate with them. I was told by a banking friend in the city not to except a quote that was .005 less than the exchange rate ie if the rate is 1.200 then don't except less than 1.195 as they are still making a fair bit of money. This is only for large amounts though ie your final 60% payment.
Hi everyone
Thank you to everyone that has been kind enough to reply "currency direct" seems the most popular at the moment.
Thanks again
you can now submit an online request for information to Currencies Direct from my website,
this makes it very easy for you and they´ll do all the running

Recently I reviewed the History of TNA: Year One DVD and had a couple of issues of with it. The DVD presented a certain viewpoint of what it took to get TNA wrestling up and running. I understand seeing things through rose colored glasses, but the main feature made it seem as if TNA never had a bad idea and only encountered the most minor of bumps during their first year of business. There is also one man that was all but completely left out of the revisionist history. That man is Jerry Jarrett.
The Story of the Development of the NWA TNA is an insanely in-depth account of what it took to get TNA Wrestling off the ground as well as the highs and lows of their first several months in business. The first thing to note is that Jerry Jarrett's book is less like Mick Foley's Have a Nice Day and more like The Diary of Anne Frank, except for the whole teenage girl thing (that's more of a Jerry Lawler gimmick anyway.) It is a collection of entries from Jarrett's personal journal in 2002, which is an interesting way to do a book, and is probably more acceptable to a reader due to the phenomenon of blogging over the past couple of years. In addition to giving his thoughts, Jarrett also includes several lengthy emails that he wrote to people at the time, including several to former Pro Wrestling Torch assistant editor, Jason Powell.
"The road to hell is paved with good intentions."
Jarrett starts right from the beginning, saying that he and his son Jeff had an idea for a new wrestling promotion and needed to go about finding a way to get financing. Jarrett gave details of his flights to L.A. to meet with InDemand executives and from Day One we found out that just about everything TNA is associated with is doomed. Jarrett had a horrible experience at the meeting, which was made even worse after finding out InDemand wanted a huge deposit from TNA to assure they would continue the project. Speaking of money, the book overwhelms the reader with the financial detail of starting up a wrestling promotion. You will not believe the amount of data throughout the book and it gets to the point where it all becomes meaningless. To tell you the truth if I see the name SunTrust bank anytime soon I'm going to scream.
The Jarrett's still felt confident that their business plan was a strong one though and didn't feel that they had any competition. Jarrett said that he watched one of those WWA pay per views that Andrew McManus used to run and called it, "The worst PPV in the history of the wrestling business." I believe this show was headlined by Jeff Jarrett.
In wrestling, word gets around fast and Jerry found out that none other than Vince McMahon himself found out about TNA's plans to start a promotion after reading an issue of the PWTorch newsletter. To stir the pot even more, when InDemand agreed to carry TNA they cancelled the WWE Fanatix PPVs to clear room for it. That sure must have gone over well up in Stamford, CT. Once TNA had a PPV channel to carry the show, Jarrett went about contacting talent to appear and found out right away how insane certain wrestlers are. In particular Jarrett went back and forth with the lawyers for Randy Savage and the Ultimate Warrior many times before finally giving up. Wonderful, brutally honest stuff that you just don't get from many wrestling publications.
"My opinion of Vince Russo is that he is truly delusional."
If you are not a fan of Vince Russo then this is clearly the book for you because one of the recurring themes throughout the book is that Jarrett believes Russo to be a complete idiot that is incapable of producing a wrestling show. Jarrett felt that Russo enjoyed limited success in the WWE under the extremely watchful eye of Vince McMahon, but that he has bombed everywhere else since. Jarrett also felt Russo's style would not mesh with the rules of booking wrestling that Jarrett has learned over the past 30 years. What seems clear to me reading the book is that Vince Russo -- whether Jarrett liked it or not -- was indeed part of the early part of TNA, something the company has vehemently denied, I believe even to this day. For the entire year of 2002 Jarrett banged his head against the wall to get his son Jeff to realize what a big mistake it was to give Russo any creative control, but Russo was too close a friend to Jeff for the words to make any difference.
"Jeff is learning the hard way about some or most professional wrestlers."
The ridiculous and absurd antics of wrestlers show up throughout the book. Jarrett told an amusing story of how Dusty Rhodes tried to hold up TNA for more money, while Buff Bagwell and Sean Waltman have their share of moments that will make you wonder why companies continue to book them. One of the stories about Waltman included Waltman's demand about a girl he was seeing at the time being booked on a show. The girl, Alicia Webb - who also happened to be a former girlfriend of TNA wrestler Ken Shamrock - was offered $350 for the show, but she wanted $500. Waltman told TNA to just take $150 off of his pay and give it to her. Lest we forget that now Waltman has heat with Ken Shamrock for dating one of his former girlfriends. You can picture Jarrett pulling his hair out just by reading his account of the story. Tremendous material.
"If we do 15% of the WWE buyrate nationwide, we will get between 90,000 and 100,000 buys. Our break-even point is about 55,000 buys."
Talk about your fuzzy math. I thought about this stupid sentence for a few days and still can't figure out what the hell Jarrett was smoking, unless he thinks the WWE was getting 750,000 or more buys for their PPVs. This just in: they weren't. This is also the area of the book where the Jay Hassman (who Jerry calls "Haussman") story starts to develop. At first, Jarrett said that Hassman was estimating huge success for the TNA PPVs, but over the course of the following weeks all hell broke loose. You won't believe how crazy this story got as eventually TNA was absolutely convinced that Jay Hassman was -- get this -- a saboteur for Vince McMahon. Jarrett personally couldn't imagine any other reason for Hassman's actions even though it seemed every person he told the story to informed him it was probably more about Hassman's incompetence than anything else.
Long story short, TNA immediately had to scale back production costs because their buyrates were nowhere close to what they were led to believe. We never actually find out what the buyrates were because, as Jerry said, "Our buyrate is terrible. We really don't know how bad because there are few sources available that know this business." I found this to be confusing, because every other business that uses pay-per-view, including the WWE, gets their buyrate information and yet TNA claims it can't. Because of the dire money situation, Jarrett saw what looked to be like rats jumping off a sinking ship. He mentioned several people who refused to work for TNA unless they got their paycheck right now (despite Jarrett being in dire straits) and at the same time really put over others (such as Jeremy Borash) who said they would stay with the company through thick and thin. Borash is one guy who comes through this book smelling like roses and is another guy who really didn't get any credit during TNA's own DVD.
What I thought was interesting was the way Jarrett would talk about the early shows. He does bring up that they made mistakes, but for the most part was proud by just about every show they did. Jarrett said that often he went to the Internet to check out what feedback was and almost inevitably it was positive. This is not the TNA I remember watching in 2002, although I do recall the X-Division getting a lot of love. Jarrett often brings up the disastrous Dupp Cupp, mostly because it wasn't his idea, but didn't really touch on any of the other what-the-hell-were-they-thinking stuff like a midget beating off in a trash can.
Jarrett actually included a forwarded email in the book and is something probably all of us get in our email boxes with the subject "TOUCHING STORY PASS ON!" The difference between most of us and Jerry Jarrett is that we delete that email without even reading it. Jarrett puts it into his book. Not long thereafter, Jarrett went into a story where he tried to compare the love he had for the New York Yankees and how it diminished when he read about the reality of sports, such as players leaving for more money. This story was told to basically slam the dirtsheet industry. I don't know how to take it seriously, because professional sports have a million times more scrutiny than the world of wrestling and yet it doesn't drive the fans away. A lot of people "in the business" such as Jerry Jarrett and most of the industry try to blame guys like Dave Meltzer and Bryan Alrvarez, among others, for ruining the business, but to me that is one of the lamest excuses they have next to the laughable cyclical nature of business. Even weirder was that it seemed Jerry was in constant communication with Wade Keller and Jason Powell. I guess it is kinda like Eric Bischoff slamming dirtsheets in his book, and then finding out Bischoff was talking to Meltzer a lot during his hot run.
We get to see Panda Energy go from a prospective investor in TNA to bankrolling the company, which, for all intents and purposes, kept TNA in business. Jarrett was really sweating this one because he and Jeff were personally liable for something like 1.5 million dollars, and if Panda would have backed out, they would have had to declare personal bankruptcy. This was another one of those moments that made me scratch my head because Jarrett repeatedly mentions how successful his construction business was, to the tune of millions in profits every year. Panda told Jarrett they didn't want to pursue litigation with Jay Hassman and Jarrett still wouldn't let that go as he felt that if he dropped the case he would lose locker room respect. Can you imagine? Jerry gives his account of meeting Dixie Carter (who was already working for TNA) and how that led to the entire situation with Panda. Sometimes it really is a small world.
"The mindset of the professional wrestler is unique. Failure to understand is to fail in this business."
Truer words may never have been spoken. Somehow this led to yet another attack on the dirtsheet industry in general and the Torch in particular. I wonder if Sony or NewLine send out corporate emails telling their employees that websites such as DVDActive.com or magazines like Entertainment Weekly are out to destroy them? Regardless, Jarrett brought up more great stories of just how insane some of the wrestlers who passed through TNA were. One night Jarrett was getting sick of Buff Bagwell and here's how he described Buff shooting a simple promo: "We finally began the simple interview segment with Buff and he screws up his lines five times. The director finally whispered to me that he has worked with Buff numerous times and this is as good as Buff is capable of doing the interview. I'm not sure if Buff's mind is deficient or Buff just prefers to write his own interview." Surprisingly, Jarrett had nothing but good words to say about Scott Hall, other than to keep mentioning Hall had to bail out on some shows because of all the problems he was having with his ex-wife.
The Pros: As I said earlier, Jarrett reprints several emails throughout the book and these are really enlightening. You can not imagine the length to which Jarrett goes to explain his points and it is very powerful reading. This guy knows wrestling and explains himself in thorough detail. The book could definitely have used more of these and less of the interminable interview halfway through the book (we'll get to that later.) It also would have been nice if we had been able to look at some of the emails Jarrett was responding to, but who knows what legal situations we would be talking about.
If you want to start a wrestling business, or just want to see what goes into starting a business, then YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK. There are so many of the little things that no one really talks about when starting a business that are discussed often here and it make you wonder why anyone would ever want to put themselves through all the stress. I would say half of Jarrett's entries have something to do with him going to or dealing with a bank. Believe me, the hoops they made Jarrett jump through make you understand why he needed to have a pacemaker installed shortly afterwards. I would have had a stroke months earlier than Jarrett and I'm half his age. The book also uses specifics, and not stupid vague terms, about the financial aspect of this business and while they may bore some readers I found it very interesting. I should add that after a point it became tedious because the exact same figures and banks were brought up repeatedly.
There are tons of great little details about the business that Jarrett drops throughout the book. You get to read his thoughts on the WWE's Katie Vick angle, the people who won bids on TNA's Silent Auction (remember that?) but couldn't pay, and the NFL's Monty Brown trying to squeeze more money out of TNA, among many other items.
The Cons: Jarrett explained early on that this book is his journal, reprinted "as is," and that nothing has been touched up. I can see where Jarrett was going with this, but clearly this book needed an editor for several reasons. The first is the most obvious: there are a lot of typos. I don't think that making basic spelling changes would impugn the author's work. Let's face it, we all make stupid typo mistakes, but to not correct them when given the opportunity is mind-boggling. Jarrett also misspells many names throughout the book (Kimala instead of Kamala, Jay Haussman instead of Jay Hassman) and this drove me absolutely up a wall.
Midway through the book there is a mind-numbingly long thirty page interview with Jerry Jarrett that was just inexcusable. Anywhere else this interview would have been fine (such as on the TNA website), as it's a very in-depth look at Jarrett, but putting it in the middle of this book just took away all the momentum. After the first fifteen pages I started to laugh out loud when I turned the page and saw that the interview kept going. I cannot get over what a bad taste this left in my mouth and have no idea why it was left in the book, other than fear that the book would appear too thin without it.
Jarrett repeats himself. A lot. This would be another job of the editor as there are countless examples of entries that say the exact same thing as earlier ones. A small complaint, and this had no bearing on my enjoyment of the book, is that there are no pictures. I only add this because due to the long career Jarrett has had, he undoubtedly has access to an archive of photos that would make diehard fans - the core audience for this book - drool all over themselves.
OVERALL THOUGHTS: While there were certain parts of the book that I wasn't a big fan of, most notably the never-ending interview that completely derails the book, I think there is more than enough material for me to make a strong recommendation. In fact, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in the finer points of creating a wrestling promotion because it is certainly more work than figuring out which guys you want to book. Seeing that TNA has actually made it past five years, it is very interesting to go back and see how hard it was just to get the company started. Jarrett is very passionate about TNA and it shows. The narrative jumps all over the place, but you get some laugh out loud stories along with an insanely detailed account of everything – and I mean everything – that it took to get this wrestling promotion up and running. An interesting companion piece to The History of TNA: Year One DVD as they both tell the same story from two wildly different perspectives.

Girls star Allison Williams stepped onto the Vanity Fair Oscars party red carpet looking sophisticated in an ivory Valentino gown adorned with capped sleeves and floral beading. While her color choice was safe, it was all about the intricate embellishments. The actress completed her look with diamond drop earrings and a couple of sparkly rings. Thoughts?

Compatibility: When looking at the biorhythmic relationship between two people, the key thing to understand is that we are looking at phase compatibility. In other words, 100% physical compatibility between two people does not mean that the relationship will be in a physical high all of the time - it means that all of the highs and lows between those two people will match. With this in mind, it may be clearer that when you look at a biorhythmic compatibility chart, you are looking at the highs and lows of the relationship as a whole.

Current Research Interests
My scholarship focuses on several components of school-based mentoring for preservice teachers (student teachers). The first strand of my research looks at the ways in which existing models or structures of mentoring facilitate and/or inhibit the learning of student teachers. In particular, it focuses on the ways in which issues of power and competing visions of practice make learning to teach in someone else’s classroom a difficult task. The second strand of my research focuses on the preparation of secondary school teachers for their roles as cooperating teachers (mentors) for student teachers. The third and most recent strand focuses on ways of bridging university and P-12 schools’ work of preparing teachers. In particular, this strand focuses on exploring ways that teacher education faculty and P-12 teachers who serve as cooperating teachers can work together to develop shared discourse and knowledge for preparing today’s teachers. Most recenly, I've been exploring the role of teacher education faculty in mentoring beginning teachers.

This is a lovely keepsake for parents as it is painted on board canvas. I purchase my canvas boards at Michaels in packs of 10 with my 40% off coupon. I use the cheap liquid craft paint.
STEP ONE: Mix up several mixtures of blue for the pond. Remember to have one a bit on the purple side or pinkish.
STEP TWO: Let the children cover their canvas with broke strokes of these colors. I let them "go for it." Let this dry before the next step.
STEP THREE: I give them several sizes of lily pad tracers to trace on their canvas.
STEP FOUR: I mix up several shades of green and let them paint the lily pads. Let this dry before going on to the next step.
STEP FIVE: I mix up three colors for the lilies - pink, light pink and yellow. I tell them to begin with the darker pink and build to yellow. Then we use the side of a cardboard piece and scrape lines into the wet paint. Let this dry before going on to the next step.
STEP SIX: Finally, I give them a selection of oil pastels to use. First, I offer white and blue oil pastels to make "swirls" in the pond. Second, I offer pinks and yellows to add lines to the flowers. I suggest they out line the flowers and lily pads. Finally, I offer greens and yellows for lines on the lily pads.
This is beautiful - really a great keepsake!
Delightful and joyful! Thank you for following me!
Love this blog!!

I was out getting some Christmas shopping done this afternoon when the news broke that the Reds had traded Yonder Alonso "plus others" for Padres starter, and potential ace, Mat Latos. As the afternoon grew old, the names of the "plus others" came out, and I was floored. Here are the details of the trade:
Reds get: Mat Latos
Padres get: Yonder Alonso, Edinson Volquez, Yasmani Grandal, and Brad Boxberger
Here is ESPN and SiriusXM's Jim Bowden's reaction:
- JimBowdenESPNxm JIM BOWDEN
Deal would have made more sense if the Reds had included Alonso or Grandal...but NOT both! Reds win short term..Padres win deal long term.
I couldn't agree more. I have to say I was very surprised at how much the Reds gave up in this deal for Latos. Don't get me wrong, I like Latos a lot, even pitching in Great American Ballpark.
More of my reaction and fantasy impact of this deal after the jump:
My second reaction to this deal was what are the Padres going to do with 4 first baseman? Yonder Alonso joins Jesus Guzman, Anthony Rizzo, and Kyle Blanks. Well Bowden reported that Alonso will be the Padres starting first baseman, and Rizzo will go back to AAA for "more seasoning", or could be traded. Bowden speculated that Padres GM Josh Byrnes could offer Rizzo to the Cubs, who need a first baseman and are rebuilding, for Matt Garza. I imagine the Padres would have to give up more than Rizzo for Garza. The Cubs could get more from the Rangers for Garza, possibly pitching prospect Martin Perez.
In addition to Alonso, the Padres received catching prospect Yasmani Grandal, Edinson Volquez and Brad Boxberger. Here's a quick take on the two prospects in the deal:
Yasmani Grandal
He played at three levels in the minors in 2011, hitting a combined .305-.401-.500 with 14 HRs and 68 RBI. Here is the breakdown of how he performed at each level, courtesy of Baseball-Reference:

Just as Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet had traveled in 1673 to many regions of the southern United States, they had also been through the Missouri area. By April 9, 1682, the French explorer Robert Cavalier, Sieur de La Salle took possession of the Louisiana Territory area for France of which Missouri was included. Over the next few years several settlements are attempted, but fail due to the living condition, usually swamp lands. In 1714, Etienne de Bourgmont finally manages to build and keep a fort for a number of years on the Missouri River near the mouth of the Grand River. In 1724, Fort Orleans was next built by de Bourgmont, but only last six years. St. Genevieve was established as a trading post, the first permanent white settlement.
The City of St. Louis further up the Mississippi River was founded by Pierre Laclede Liguest and Rene August Chouteau by 1764. In 1770, Spain now has control of the area of Missouri. Into the 1790s additional new towns were started along the river, including New Madrid. Then, in 1800, Spain returned the Louisiana territory to France and France sold it to the United States in 1803.
Expansion was underway by 1808, with the Missouri Fur Company organized in St. Louis. The abundance of animal pelts in the Mississippi Valley region played a key role in the development of the Upper Louisiana territory. In 1812, the Missouri Territory was created and stream boat traffic increased along the Mississippi River.
As the area grew, more African slaves are brought into Missouri. There were approximately 10,000 by 1818. The early white settlers came from several of the southeastern states and continued their use of slave labor. In August 1821, Missouri was admitted as a slave state under the ‘Missouri Compromise.’
One of the religious groups emigrating into Missouri were the Mormons. By 1838, due to internal conflicts with the state’s citizens and the Mormons, the "Extermination Order" against Mormons living in Missouri, was issued demanding that members of the Mormon church leave the state. There had been also more free African-Americans coming to Missouri and by 1842, Missouri then banned free blacks from settling in the state.
In 1849, Missouri towns of St. Louis, Independence, Westport, and St. Joseph had become points of departure for emigrants headed for California. Missouri was the "Gateway to the West" with the discovery of gold in California. The Pony Express started its first run from St. Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento, California in April 1860.
Missouri was a border state and very divided during the American Civil War. Many of the Irish and German immigrants arriving in the late 1840s and 1850s fully understood famine, oppression and revolutionary upheaval. These newcomers to Missouri quickly expressed how they were unsympathetic to slavery. In January 1865, Missouri abolished slavery by an ordinance of immediate emancipation, making Missouri the first slave state to emancipate its slaves. Woman's Suffrage got started and organized in Missouri in 1867.
With the railroad system going through the state, the economic basis expanded for Missouri. This also opened new lands for settlement by Germans who were arriving in large numbers. They helped develop small diversified industries within the cities. Later Czechs and Italians immigrated to the state.
In looking at Missouri genealogy, it is seen that by the late 1800s most of the Native Indians had been moved out of the area or died. No Indian reservations were established for the few remaining.
The City of St. Louis has remained the center of the African-American population. Most of the ethnic background for citizens of Missouri today is that of German, then Irish and English.
The population changed from 1.2 million in 1860 to 3.1 million in 1900 to 6 million citizens in 2009. Roughly 87 percent of the population today is of European descent. There are 12 percent of African-American heritage and 2.5 of Hispanic background. A small group of Missouri Creoles south of St. Louis represents about 3.5 percent of the French ancestry.

The Albertine, Shepherd's Bush
View:
FancyaPint?'s review...
Pub Fairy is a passionate friend of bitter beer, but she'll skip it when she can't drink it anywhere comfortable. And that is why we include the Albertine here, even if you can't really fancy a pint in it. In an area devoted to noisy and aggressive enjoyment, this long-established wine bar is a haven of mental health. It serves excellent food and you needn't spend quite as much on the wine as you fear. It attracts the whippety young of the BBC because it's on Wood Lane, but even if you are luvvie-phobic, remember: better the spry than the demented. The staff are goodly, the proprietor discriminating in the old-fashioned way that doesn't need bouncers, and it feels like the best sort of pub, even if it isn't one.

I do not own Dear School Gang Leader
Aiko P.O.V.
"Are you sure you will be okay dear?"
I sighed as quietly as possible, turning to face my mother. Here we go again, I thought as I pasted on my fake cheerful smile. "I'll be fine, Mother. If I don't leave now, I'll be late." I said, grabbing my favorite school bag, the black one that I had fixed up myself. The other bags that I had were designer bags, and I hated them.
"Wait, aren't you taking the limo?" Mother asked, seeing me run for the door.
"No way-erm, no I'll be fine. Goodbye!" I replied as I slipped out the door. Whew, that was a close one... I thought as I ran in the direction of my new school. Oh, dang it, I'm going to be late! To save time, instead of going through the front, I ran to the back of the school and climbed to the top of the wall. As I jumped down, it occurred to me that it was probably not the best idea to do that in a dress. Oh well, I don't care. Running inside, I stared down the empty hallways. Chemistry class 1/1, where are you? I looked around for about five minutes before I finally found the door.
"Sorry I'm late." I said as I walked in, bowing quickly. "I couldn't find the door." As I looked around the room, I noticed that basically everyone in the room was a guy! The guys stared at me,before yelling "It's a girl!" A lot of them started running towards me, but the first few got a taste of my heavy bag. They fell to the ground, and started laughing, until a boy with short black hair walked up to them and started lecturing them.
"Class, this is Daisuke Aiko. Aiko, why don't you go sit by Hayaka?" The teacher said, gesturing to said girl. I looked around, and saw the empty chair beside a girl with pink hair.
"Okay." I murmured, as I went to sit down.
Hayaka P.O.V.
"GOOD MORNING SCHOOL GANG LEADER!" greeted me as I reached the school.
"Good morning?" I replied nervously, looking between all the boys.
"School Gang Leader, we will carry you to the classroom!" The boys announced happily.
"That's really not-" I started to say, but stopped when Katou grabbed me and ran for the classroom.
"Are you okay Banchou?" He asked once we were safely inside, ignoring the yells echoing down the hall.
"Yeah, thanks Katou!" I replied, smiling. He turned away with a blush, getting up to confront the guys who had just walked in. Once everyone came in and sat down the teacher made an announcement. The teacher said we would be getting a new classmate, but they hadn't arrived yet. Of course, Ichiro and Mirai wanted it to be a girl, as did most of the class.
Another girl would be nice. I thought as I grabbed my books. We were just about to start when the door opened, and in walked...a girl! She was slightly taller than me, with a thin frame, and long red hair. Her uniform(which was originally white like mine) was made up of a black jacket and red dress, unlike my white jacket and dress. She had a black school bag with chains and studs on it, and it seemed to be very heavy. Immediately, the boys ran to get her, but she smacked some of the boys with her bag. Katou immediately got mad at the boys for messing with her, then escorted them back to their seats.
"Class, this is Daisuke Aiko. Aiko, why don't you go sit by Hayaka." The teacher said. Then the girl walked over and sat down beside me, in between me and Mirai.
"Hello, how are-" I started to say, but stopped when I heard the teacher ask us to open up our school books. Interrupted again! Oh, well. I know! I'll just ask her sit with us for lunch! Smiling, I opened up my chemistry book.
Aiko P.O.V.
At lunchtime, I was stuck looking for a place to sit. There were boys everywhere!
"Aiko! Over here!" came a voice behind me. I turned to see Hayaka waving me over to a table. There were already four other people there, the black-haired boy, a boy with orange hair, a boy with blue hair, and a boy that had red hair with a dyed black fringe. I walked over to the table, and Hayaka moved over to make space for me. Once I'd sat down, she made introductions.
"This is Katou," she said pointing to the black-haired one. "This is Shun," the orange-haired one. "This is Ichiro," the blue haired one. "And this is Mirai." the red-haired one.
"You should be careful around here," Katou murmured. "We have fights almost everyday."
Everday? I could hardly believe my luck! "You don't say." I replied, giving him a curious look.
Mirai nodded excitedly. "Here," he said, taking my bag. "I'll put a metal plate in it."
Hayaka laughed. "I need to remove one of mine. I have two in here."
"Speaking of fights," Ichiro put down his lunch, taking a newspaper from his bag. "Did you hear that there was another sighting of Akio?" Hearing that name, I almost choked on my drink. Oh no, not again.
"Akio?" I asked hesitantly, hoping I didn't look too suspicious.
"Yeah," said Mirai. "Akio Hitoshi. He defeated the Takeshi gang four months ago, the most notorious gang in Dechuan. And he was only in middle school!" Before I could say anything, the bell rang again.
"Well, lunch time's over, let's get back to class." Hayaka murmured as she cleaned up her space."Let's go."
"Sure thing." I replied as I followed the group back towards the classrooms. I should be careful at this school. Who knows who's watching.
After school, Mirai walked with me to my house, since apparently he lived near me. On the way there, I decided to ask him about Akio. Anything that made him think I didn't know about the guy.
"So where was he seen this time? That Akio guy?" I asked.
"Well, he was spotted near the beach. He beat up some boys, some of which are students at our school." Mirai answered, before turning to me. "It happened last week. So, Aiko, where do you live?"
I cringed inwardly. Well, since he's walking with me, I might as well tell him. Though I really don't want to. I stopped, and pointed at a mansion a few blocks away from us. He froze, then gaped as he took it in.
"So, you're family is well off, huh?" he muttered awkwardly. I blushed, but quickly regained control of my embarrassment.
"Yeah well," I said, sighing. "Sometimes I wish I could just be normal."
We walked the rest of the way in silence until we reached my house.
"So, do you want me to come by tomorrow?" Mirai asked, stopping in front of the gate.
I stared at him, probably gaping. "Tomorrow?"
"Yeah. Do you want me to walk you to school?" He asked again.
"Sure." I replied, as a smile broke out on my face. "You don't mind?" "
No, it'll be fine." Mirai said, chuckling. "I'll be here at seven thirty, so don't forget!" He threw me a fake salute, before turning and waved to me before starting to walk towards his house.
I couldn't help but smile. He's actually a pretty nice guy. I thought as I walked inside.
"Welcome home Miss Aiko." One of the maids took my bag, smiling at me. "How was your day?" I thought about it for a minute.
"Well... it was certainly different, but is was nice."

Preds Season Over, but Not Forgotten
The Nashville Predators truly have some of the best fans in the league, and it proved that Monday night after being eliminated by the Vancouver Canucks in Game 6 of the Western Conference semi-finals.
The 17,113 individuals in attendance stood behind their Predators as the hand shakes were given between the players and coaches of the clubs, and sent the Preds off with an incredible ovation. The crowd stayed in the stands cheering on Nashville, who had its best season in franchise history, and didn't leave until the Preds left the ice.
It was an incredible sight to see, and despite the loss the fans were absolutely proud to call themselves Preds fans.
Nashville's may have been eliminated but that doesn't change the fact that they had one of the best playoff runs in franchise history and continually made history during the push. The success the Predators found this year garnered a lot of new fans and will undoubtedly bring in more new fans in the season to come.
I'm proud to say that I am a fan of the Nashville Predators and happy with everything the team did this season even if they were knocked out of the post season.
Hockey may be over in Smashville for the 2010-2011 season, but it will not be forgotten. Nashville finally received the attention it deserved during its historic playoff run, and will hopefully be recognized as a respectable team and a hockey town from now on.
Game 6 Recap:
Despite an early first period fluke, Nashville played one of its best games this series. It was not going to give up without a fight and that's what's so great about this hockey team. In the face of total elimination, it fights until the last second and never gives up.
Monday night's game was intense from start to finish. The Preds started the opening frame with all sorts of energy and for once in the series, had a lot of time possession time with the puck. However, the Canucks were able to get on the board early when Ryan Suter made a poor decision pass to Weber right in front of Pekka Rinne that was intercepted by none other than Ryan Kesler.
Kesler found Mason Raymond skating towards the net and passed the puck over to him where he backhanded the puck into the twine.
If things couldn't get any worse being down 1-0 to the best team in the league, they did when the zebra's called an unsportsman-like conduct penalty on Jordin Tootoo just over a minute after Raymond's goal.
The call was questionable at best. It appeared that Toots was cross checked and fell to the ice as a result of being hit by the stick by such a brute force, but as had been the case this whole series, the refs played favorites and gave Vancouver the power play.
Vancouver showcased to Nashville why they finished the regular season with one of the top power play units in the league when they scored their second goal of the night just 36 seconds into the Tootoo minor penalty.
Again, Kesler demonstrated how awesome of a player he really is when he got the puck to Daniel Sedin who scored his first goal of the series. Daniels brother, Henrick, also assisted the goal that brought the 'Nucks up 2-0.
Nashville finally answered when David Legwand took a shot to the left of Luongo that somehow found its way past the goal line and into the net. The goal had to be reviewed by the officials and for good reason.
Even on the replay, I still can't find the puck, but I'm glad for once that the zebra's and the hockey giants up in Canada sided with Nashville and called the goal good.
Joel Ward and Sergei Kostitsyn were given assists on Leggy's goal, which continued Ward's point streak to five games and saw the first point by Kostitsyn in the series.
The Predators had the chance to tie things up when Martin Erat got a break-away chance at 13:45 in the second, but he waited too long to make a move and was taken down in front of Luongo and missed his chance. Many fans felt as though Erat should have been given a penalty shot, but the hit was clean and didn't warrant any kind of punishment against the Canucks.
If Erat would have just taken a shot instead of trying to rush the net, I believe he would have tied things up. But as Nashville always does, the perfect play is for some reason more important to the team rather than just getting the puck on net.
The Canucks went on to win the game 2-1 and eliminate the Predators from the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Other Notes:
It wasn't that Vancouver played a better game, because they didn't by any means. They were outshot in the first and second period and played more time on the chase rather than carrying the puck into the zone. Nashville just made some bad plays, one of which resulted in a turnover by Suter and the first goal of the night by Raymond.
We also can't exactly blame the refs for costing us the game this time either. Nashville had five power play chances over the course of the night, but continued to struggle getting anything done with the man advantage. The team will definitely work to fix that problem next season.
The game was yet another where the team victorious won by a lone goal.
I really hope that the Sharks can get things done tonight and stop the Red Wings dead in their tracks. I don't want Vancouver to win the cup, and I especially don't want the Wings to win either. And if the Sharks win do win tonight, then the Canucks are going to have a hard time advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals.
Both Chicago and Nashville made Vancouver work extremely hard to eliminate them from the post season, and if San Jose is their next opponent, they will have to work just as hard if not more.
Win this game San Jose and eliminate the Vancouver, and Smashville will forgive you a little bit for knocking us out of the playoffs those two consecutive years.

June Shortstop Tier Rankings
A lot has happened since the May consensus shortstop rankings were published. Those will be updated around the All-Star break, but until then here are my tiered rankings for June.
Tier 1
Starlin Castro
Troy Tulowitzki
Rafael Furcal
Jed Lowrie
Hanley Ramirez
Castro was a pretty valuable player last year when he hit 10 home runs, stole 22 bases and hit .307. We’re through 60 games this season and he already has five homers and 16 steals and is hitting .308. Our ZiPS updated season projections have him swiping 32 bags with 11 homers. He’s being far more aggressive than last season, swinging at 41.6 percent of balls outside the zone, but it’s possible he goes 15/30/.300 with 80 RBI and 80 runs. Not many players, let alone shortstops, are going to have those totals. The biggest surprise in this group is Jed Lowrie. We’ve all been teased by his potential before. He’s getting regular playing time now, and has avoided injury thus far, and the results are speaking for themselves. His 12 homers lead the position, though he’s driven in himself nearly half the time. He’s become more selective this season, swinging less and walking more. I’ve always been a Lowrie believer and it’s paying off right now.
Tier 2
Derek Jeter
Elvis Andrus
Jose Reyes
Asdrubal Cabrera
Kyle Seager
The real surprise of this group is Seager. The 24-year-old has impressed all around and is going to finish with double digit steals and home runs while maintaining a decent average and OBP. He already has 17 doubles as well, pushing his Isolated Slugging (SLG% – BA) to .210, second behind Jed Lowrie. Reyes had a rough April in his new environment, but has been returning to normal levels since. Every one of his main slash numbers has gone up from April to May and May to June. If he keeps it up he’ll get bumped into the first tier. Andrus is hitting for a higher average, getting on base more, and slugging more than ever. He’s on pace to have the lowest stolen base total of his career, but should still get to 30 bags.
Tier 3
J.J. Hardy
Mike Aviles
Ian Desmond
Jimmy Rollins
Marco Scutaro
Zack Cozart
Jhonny Peralta
I’m not a believer in Aviles, as I’ve written lately. He had a decent start but doesn’t have the plate discipline I like to push him any higher. Hardy has great power for the position, but you have to be ok with giving up some batting average in exchange for home runs. The same goes for Desmond, though he’ll steal you ~15-20 bases. Peralta has been a disappointment after a great 2011 season. He’s started to rebound, though, posting a .756 OPS in May and a 1.054 OPS in 23 June plate appearances. If he keeps it up he will easily move up a tier in next month’s rankings.
Tier 4
Dee Gordon
Alcides Escobar
Yunel Escobar
Gordon has been a disappointment, not getting on base enough to use his amazing speed. He does have 17 steals, but how many could he have if his on base percentage wasn’t .280? Of the two Escobars, Alcides is playing the best. He’s been much better than his last two seasons, raising his average and OBP to respectable levels. That success is partly due to an increase in his BABIP of .345 when it hadn’t cracked .290 in 2010 or 2011. When you’re not fast, having a 63.2% ground ball rate is rarely a good idea. Yunel Escobar is finding that out the hard way. After a very good 2011 he’s hitting just .250/.307/.329.
The Rest
Alexei Ramirez
Willie Bloomquist
Jamey Carroll
Sean Rodriguez
Elliot Johnson
Cliff Pennington
Brandon Crawford
Erick Aybar
These players shouldn’t be owned in standard mixed leagues. They simply don’t provide enough value to sustain ownership.
STARLIN CASTRO at number one? Just leaving aside for the moment any arguments about Tulo being that he’s out with an injury (albeit one that should see him return in 3 days) you used the ZiPS projection for Castro to justify his #1 ranking. Then you put Hanley Ramirez, who’s ZiPS projection utterly annihilates Castro’s, 4 spots beneath him. Is this tailored for a league that weights singles as if they’re home runs??? I don’t get it.
Maybe I’m biased since I have Tulo in 4 of my 5 leagues (including 2 long term keepers)…but having Castro ahead Tulo is nucking futs.
Andrelton Simmons?
Great call on Seager. Unfortunately he hasn’t played any games at SS this year and in ESPN leagues he qualifies only as a 3B.
He does qualify at SS in yahoo leagues.
Stopped reading when I saw tier 1.
I’ll assume you wrote this to convince someone in your league to trade you Hanley for Jed Lowrie.
Godspeed
Agreed.
I’m extremely confused and didn’t bother proceeding after tier 1… Lowrie and Furcal in tier 1 and Castro #1 overall? I don’t get it.
(Although I did scroll down to read some comments on these bizarre ranks)
At what point do we stop assuming Asdrubal Cabrera is going to regress and think that possibly we simply have a case of a guy who has been around for a while, but is only now beginning to hit his prime? His plate discipline numbers suggest that his decrease in K’s and increase in BB’s can be sustained, and even with a HR/FB ratio about 4% lower than last year, he should still finish with 15 homeruns to go along with 30+ doubles.
Yeah, ridiculous to have Castro at 1…..
furcal ahead of cabrera? please explaine
Great List…any thoughts on where Plouffe would fit in these tiers?
Plouffe is SS eligible in most leagues…if Seager’s on this list, Plouffe HAS to be.
STARLIN CASTRO at #1?
JED LOWRIE ahead of Hanley Ramirez?
WTF?? this may be more inane than the NL SP list that Dan Wade pooped out last week.
wait a minute, I just passed out and hit my head on the floor and blacked out, I just had this horrible dream where somebody thought Jed Lowrie was a better fantasy SS going forward than Hanley Rami… OH MY GOD IT WASN’T A DREAM.
Hanley: .254, 33 R, 11 HR, 37 RBI, 10 SB
Lowrie: .289, 27 R, 12 HR, 28 RBI, 2 SB
Lowrie hasn’t even been better than Hanley for the first two months of the season. Unbelievable.
if you use those kind of stats around here to back an argument, you’re bound to get shunned.
Still, I agree. Castro at 1 is a bit much, need to see more out of furcal and lowrie, ANDRUS should be tier one, right up there with Castro as he is a starlin with a little less power and a little more speed. Having Jeter ahead of him, especially after acknowledging Andrus’ enormous strides towards stardom with the batting average, XBH, and plate discipline all skyrocketing. He was considered #5-6 coming INTO the year.
what are you talking about Daniel?
This is a fantasy article. Those are the exact stats that matter.
hey, remember when Erik Hahmann ranked Jed Lowrie ahead of Hanley Ramirez in a SS fantasy ranking?
no? …. um, then do you remember when Erik Hahmann “purposely excluded” Hanley Ramirez in the SS keeper rankings this past offseason, and then posted a lame follow-up article about why he couldn’t handle the task?
no? ….. um, then do you remember when Erik Hahmann made the same idiotic mistake in his SS rankings last year when he ranked Hanley Ramirez at the bottom of tier 3, outside the top 10, and behind such luminaries as Erick Aybar, Yunel Escobar and Sexwi-Lexei?
so why does Erik still get to do SS articles? Thank god for the consensus rankings.
obviously I’m bored at work, don’t mean to sit here harassing poor Mr. Hahmann for his incompetence as I know we aren’t ever allowed to criticize free content… but maybe it would be better if the individual rankings articles had to be passed around to other FG authors for quick approval just to make sure nothing fails the “sanity check / smell test”.
this is a serious request. I’m sure if Erik had emailed his proposed tiers out to Eno et al somebody would have been like, um, have you actually thought this through good sir?
Yea… generally they’re good but definitely some glaring mistakes here.
Bonifacio is due back in a few weeks, and still leads all SS in SB. Since his legs were not injured, and his thumb never did much heavy lifting anyway (.047 ISO) he should probably still be in Tier 3 or so.
~ if you use those kind of stats around here to back an argument, you’re bound to get shunned. ~
Normally, I would agree with that point. But in the context of fantasy rankings, those old school numbers are probably the best to use. And the newer metrics can give some insight as to whether one thinks that performance can be sustained or will regress. But I have never been part of a league that used BABIP, ISO, WAR, etc.
yes, I acknowledge that right now. My bad. Still, just using those numbers isn’t going to get you any where in determining future production.
I wasn’t sure if you were being sarcastic or not but apparently you missed my point.
First off, this is a 5×5 fantasy article and the stats I quoted are their 5×5 stats, so it’s 100% relevant.
Second, the point wasn’t about predicting future performance. Rather, the point was to highlight the absurdity of ranking Lowrie ahead of Hanley by pointing out that even THIS SEASON to date Hanley has been better.
Obviously, no analysis of career performance nor future projections would possibly rank Lowrie in the same universe as Hanley as a fantasy player. So the ONLY possible explanation is that current season performance strongly favors Lowrie. Thus the reason for pointing out that even that isn’t valid, as Hanley has been better YTD.
Just one more way to show how ridiculous the ranking was.
I really enjoy whenever there’s a new Hahmann article, if only for the comments.
I’m not going to overreact or be “rude” in reply to this article like many other commenters, but I still have a few objections. Mainly because I actually want a reply. Many, in fact, but I just want to talk about Elvis Andrus’ ranking. Keep in mind, that, coming into the season, he was generally ranked behind Tulo, Reyes, Castro, Ramirez, and by some Cabrera. This year, he is having a career year by far.
First of all, WAR has Lowrie and Andrus easily on top. Even with the injury, it makes sense that Tulo is ahead of Andrus, just because of his elite track record
I’ll just leave Hanley and Tulo alone.
Looking at Castro, Furcal, Lowrie and Jeter, here are some numbers.
BB/K
Andrus-0.94
Furcal-0.72
Lowrie-0.67
Jeter-0.63
Castro-0.14 (ew…)
That’s just basic plate discipline. Andrus has the second highest Zone% of all SS, eclipsing the 50% mark and 3% higher than the next highest of the bunch in Lowrie; with the Ranger lineup’s protection behind Andrus, he clearly isn’t being pitched around, rather being attacked with strikes. To have so much of a better BB/K than the others while getting the most strikes is definitely to his credit. His SwStr% is only higher than Furcal (by a tenth of a %). Anyway, it’s probably pretty clear that, for leagues with OBP, Andrus’ OBP is no fluke.
Andrus has no ISO; that’s not part of his game. Yet it is still trending up, as his 2B+3B is already as high as 2010, almost as high as 2009 and on pace to easily ecliple his career high of 30 in 2011. Even his drawfish ISO this year is xtill barely lower than the likes of Furcal, Jeter and Castro. His OBP easily makes up for that small difference.
All told, his season to this point is very similar to Jeter and furcal (OBP and Power). Not including Andrus’ speed, easily the best. Which one projects to continue and/or have this success over many years. Who was expected to do the best? Andrus. I really don’t see any reason for Jeter and Furcal to be above him.
Concerning Castro, Castro has a little more pop than Andrus, but his inability to walk and get on base as much as Andrus more than makes up for that small difference. He has a few more steals but hasn’t in the past and they will probably end up with a similar number. Having Castro above him is not that unreasonable, but in no way should Starlin be a tier and a half above Andrus.
Andrus’ power is not at all like Lowrie and Cabrera. Their OBPs aren’t much below andrus’s. The steals for Andrus make up for part of that. Does Lowrie have the track record to be expected to sustain his numbers?
Standard stats for 5 by 5 fantasy players? Runs+RBi is in this order: Furcal, Andrus, Castro, Lowrie, Cabrera, Jeter.
in the end, this is how I assess those above Andrus.
Tulo and Hanley-Yeah, probably.
Castro, Lowrie and Cabrera-I don’t quite think so, but a pretty good case can be made.
Furcal and Jeter-No…
Check that: I’m not sure why I suddenly added Asdrubal into the equation…must have thought he was ranked ahead of Andrus as well. Ignore what I said about Cabrera.
These rankings are downright horrible.
I find it pretty cowardly that this author’s rankings are almost universally blasted, yet he never posts in the comments to defend his position or accept that he might have made a mistake.
After so many controversial/horrible posts, why does Fangraphs continue to allow him to write these?
obviously I agree ;-)
I really do think the worst part is his unwillingness to appear in the comments and defend his rankings with analysis / rationale. It’s smacks of both cowardice and pretension.
Say what you will about the other guys, but Eno, Howard, Pods, etc. are more than willing to come talk about their articles. Even poor Howard who sticks his neck out to the snarky stathead crowd with his “Kicking Rocks” column is willing to respond to the more abusive posts :p
Agreed… I hate to criticize a man who’s working for free, but this is pretty bad. Add to it that Hahmann bascially refuses to defend himself and it seems a bit pretentious.
A lot of “the rest” have to be owned in mixers, if you use a 2B, SS and MI position.
I just gave out Carlos Quentin for Kyle Seager straight up, in hopes for Petco to devour Quentins quick start and I need help at 2b. Was it a decent trade?
that’s a bit tricky as it will be highly dependent on your team needs. Despite his nice start to the season, I still think Seager has most value as a “swiss army knife” who can rotate around your roster and plug holes making sure you don’t lose AB’s when a guy has a day off or misses a few games to a minor injury.
that said, he’s not an elite performer in any category and his value comes from positional flexibility and broadly decent performance — he won’t kill you in any category but isn’t going to put you over the top either.
Quentin probably will still hit for power at Petco (it only really murders LH powr) and also stands a decent chance of getting traded, so I’m not sure your rationale was sound. I do like trading Quentin now with his hot start, but I think you could have aimed higher than Seager. But losing Quentin isn’t going to kill your team, he’s “just” a decent power hitting OF over the long run, he’s really a 2-cat guy (HR + RBI) and is a total zero in SB and mediocre in R + AVG.
They dont have Starlin ranked #1, he is in the Top Tier…Which means he has been one of the Top Shortstops this year…those are the top 5 thus far….

8-year-old Jane Fiemeyer, aka Warrior Princess, of Minnesota has been battling Leukemia for over a year now, and she’s reached out to some very awesome guys for a very special request.
Jane’s mother, Jil Fiemeyer, put off signing up for Make-A-Wish Foundation until very recently. “It was always kind of one of those things that we would do when the bone marrow was complete and she was healthy to enjoy it,” Jil says. She has been trying her best to make Jane’s dream of meeting the band Big Time Rush come true, asking everyone to spread the word so hopefully the boys will see it.
Soon enough, Kevin Schmidt, brother of Kendall, tweeted, “Beautiful Jane Flemeyer, a birdy told me for you to look out for a message from @bigtimerush tomorrow. :) Xo Warrior Princess, Kevin.” Kendall and Logan along with Kendall's brother recorded a video for Jane and are working on setting up a Skype session with her.
It’s amazing what Big Time Rush is doing for Jane, and we with the Firmeyer family and the Warrior Princess the best!

08:13 AM ET 08.17 | Rick Carlisle's options appear to be drying up. The Mavericks' search for a successor to lead assistant coach Terry Stotts will continue without two of the prime names [Carlisle] had been targeting. Former Toronto Raptors coach Jay Triano, according to NBA coaching sources, is poised to join Stotts' staff in Portland as opposed to coming to Dallas. That means Stotts. ... Two coaching sources said late Thursday that a new name to watch in the Mavs' search, who fulfills the head-coaching prerequisites, is Jim O'Brien.
Toronto was dead last in the league on the defensive end under Jay Triano

Seems like a lot of assistant coaches are moving this year. Interesting that is not just players in this off-season.
Carlisle is a good coach and the Mavs are re-building themselves. Looks like a good place to be for an assistant.

I love it when our wet weather creek is running.
The Donkettes have a slightly different opinion.
Want to see more water?!

I love your blog! Thankyou!!
Such a pretty creek! It looks so peaceful...
Cheers,

And here I thought they were just unwilling to get their pedicures messy.
I do love a donkey! I waxed philosophical on my desire to have a donkey on my blog recently..lol. And nope, they aren't at all stubborn, just humans are stubborn :)
I never knew that about donkeys. And yes, I did wonder about the white line.!
I've read that same book...it's great. We now have 5 donkeys, and most people DO believe they are stubborn. But they are just being careful, checking out the situation.
Ours will stand for a l o n g time looking at our stream before they will cross...and then they always must cross in the same exact spot as before. They are really very comical creatures...
Hey, moving water can sweep you off your feet pretty quick. Those donkeys are just being sensible, not stubborn.
They need a bridge :)
I love the donkeys!

Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee: Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the U.S. Government's response to drug-related money laundering in Mexico. President Clinton and Secretary Christopher have made the fight against global money laundering and international organized crime one of our principal foreign policy concerns, integrating it with our other key national security objectives. In this regard, battling the growing strength and wealth of the Mexican drug cartels, responsible for shipping some 50% to 70% of all cocaine to the U.S. market and huge amounts of other illicit drugs, is especially important.
Success in achieving our foreign policy and law enforcement objectives in Mexico and elsewhere strongly depends on a coordinated strategy at home and abroad. As you know, both the Secretary of State and the U.S. Chief of Mission have statutory responsibilities for coordinating activities of U.S. Government personnel abroad, including the representatives of U.S. law enforcement agencies. The Department of State also supports our law enforcement mission using the tools of diplomacy to enhance international cooperation and by funding technical assistance and law enforcement training programs internationally. I would, therefore, like to discuss the State Department's role in advancing our law enforcement interests in Mexico with special reference to money laundering linked to the illegal drug trade.
As committee members know, the President gave Mexico full certification for its narcotics control record in the last cycle. There should be no mistake about the Administration's position. We share the Congress' serious concerns about the drug trade in Mexico and its impact on our own narcotics problem at home. President Zedillo also recognizes the seriousness of the drug trafficking situation and has declared it to be the principal national security threat to his country. The Mexican Government is taking demonstrable action to fight drug trafficking and related crimes, including money laundering.
The Money Laundering Threat in Mexico
Money laundering is a global phenomenon--a threat to financial institutions and stability around the world. The United States is no exception. It tends to move away from jurisdictions that impose effective controls and to those where such controls are not in place. As criminals have seen the risk and cost of money laundering rise in the U.S., they have looked to Mexico and other markets for the initial placement of their illicit proceeds. As the State Department noted in its 1996 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), Mexico is a high-priority money laundering concern, primarily for this reason. Its proximity to the U.S.; serious problems of corruption; and lack--until earlier this year--of adequate legislation, regulation or enforcement made Mexico an increasingly important "money laundering haven of choice for initial placement of U.S. drug cash into the world's financial system." Once placed into Mexico's increasingly sophisticated financial system, these proceeds can be moved in a variety of forms, including wire transfers and drafts drawn on Mexican banks payable through United States' correspondent accounts. All of these mechanisms are, of course, designed to conceal the illicit source of these funds. Indeed, the successful layering of complex financial transactions allows illicit proceeds, generated in the U.S., to be repatriated to the U.S. undetected.
There are many reasons why Mexico is a major destination of choice for Western Hemisphere drug cartels seeking to evade tighter enforcement measures in the U.S. The porous 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico allows bulk cash to be smuggled out of the U.S. and into Mexico with relative ease. Because Mexico is only now developing suspicious reporting and large currency transaction reporting requirements, these illicit proceeds have been placed into Mexican banks and non-bank financial institutions with virtual anonymity. Mexican officials have also stated that corruption within the supervision and enforcement systems is another important factor facilitating money laundering in Mexico. Indeed, money laundering activities are enormously profitable for compromised financial institutions, corrupt banking officials and money brokers, and others willing to exploit the weaknesses in the Mexican financial system.
Mexican officials estimate that roughly $30 billion in drug cash was repatriated to Mexican drug cartels in 1994, and an even higher amount was moved into Mexico for repatriation to Colombia during the same period. Recent allegations of money laundering and corruption leveled at important politicians in Mexico have heightened awareness and concern about this problem in Mexico and the United States.
The U.S. Response
U.S. engagement with Mexico to enhance our anti-money laundering efforts is not itself new. As part of the Administration's narcotics control strategy and its rigorous application of the drug certification law, we have targeted money laundering controls as a key component of the program to combat drugs. If we are to attack the drug cartels successfully, we must attack their financial resources with vigorous enforcement of money laundering and asset forfeiture laws. In this regard, we have for some time worked closely with Mexican law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute money launderers and drug traffickers. The January 1996 deportation of Juan Garcia Abrego, the first foreign-based drug trafficker to be placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, is only one example of the success of these cooperative efforts. In general, the Mexican Government's performance in extraditing fugitives to the United States has improved substantially in 1996. Twice as many fugitives--10 in all--were extradited to the U.S. in the first eight months of 1996 as in all of 1995. Among the 1996 extraditees are two Mexican nationals, an unprecedented step given the Mexican constitution's strictures on extraditions of nationals. Additional extraditions of Mexican nationals are anticipated. Of course, we want to see all of our extradition requests honored in every country to bring criminals to justice. But we are seeing more criminals returned to the United States or prosecuted in Mexico, and this is progress.
The Department of State works closely with U.S. law enforcement agencies to support the full range of fugitive and other law enforcement investigations involving Mexico and, where appropriate, to secure the cooperation and participation of Mexican authorities. We also support law enforcement training efforts in Mexico designed specifically to enhance its ability to work effectively with U.S. law enforcement officials.
Our efforts have been hampered, however, by Mexico's slow progress in developing a comprehensive anti-money laundering regime of its own. Ultimately, it is the adoption and aggressive enforcement of strong laws and regulations in Mexico that will allow it to become a fully effective partner in the global fight against money laundering. We have, therefore, redoubled our efforts to work with Mexico to develop this comprehensive regimen. Our efforts have centered around two Presidential initiatives that I would like to discuss briefly.
President Clinton directed last fall that Treasury, in consultation with State and Justice, identify countries which have the most serious money laundering problems and pursue appropriate measures to address our concerns. To implement this strategy, the law enforcement, intelligence and diplomatic communities have worked together to assess global money laundering and develop country-specific programs to address it. At this juncture, we are in the initial stages of engaging diplomatic efforts with countries identified as having serious money laundering problems. In accordance with the tenets of this Presidential directive, more aggressive measures to bring about the necessary reforms are being deferred until diplomatic avenues have been pursued fully.
As we developed our money laundering strategy, it became clear that in Mexico, money laundering controls had to be part of a comprehensive drug control effort. Since President Zedillo took office in December 1994, Mexico's counternarcotics efforts have intensified significantly--in eradication, law enforcement action, interdiction, and judicial sector reform. In March 1995, President Clinton and President Zedillo established a High Level Contact Group to ensure that important areas of the bilateral relationship - including money laundering concerns - receive regular attention at the most senior levels of government, both to press for even greater cooperation and work to resolve disputes. Under the supervision of the High Level Contact Group, technical working groups have been established on such issues as counternarcotics efforts, arms trafficking, chemical precursors and money laundering.
Our efforts to engage Mexico in these related Presidential initiatives are already bearing fruit. In May 1996, after years of inaction by previous governments, the Zedillo Administration enacted a bill establishing money laundering as a criminal offense punishable by five to 15 years imprisonment. Prior to this new law, money laundering in Mexico was a tax offense which provided for a penalty of only three to nine years and could only be triggered through the course of an audit of a financial institution.
By contrast, the May 1996 legislation has important features that will clearly strengthen the Mexican Government's capability to detect, investigate and prosecute money launderers. It includes a wide range of predicate offenses--beyond drug trafficking. This is important because we know that sophisticated money launderers increasingly co-mingle the proceeds of drug and non-drug crimes. The legislation also applies equally to all those involved in laundering transactions, including the employees and officers of financial institutions. Moreover, while the law on its face requires an individual to have actual knowledge that the proceeds being laundered come from an illicit source, Mexican officials have advised us that, similar to U.S. law, the knowledge requirement also includes "willful blindness." As our law enforcement colleagues will no doubt tell you, the adoption of this standard is an important feature to compel vigilance among bank officials and others who may otherwise hide their heads in the sand to facilitate money laundering activity.
In addition to the May 1996 money laundering legislation, the Mexican Government has also submitted to the Mexican Congress a critically important legal package aimed at enhancing the government's ability to combat organized crime. This bill was approved overwhelmingly by the Mexican Senate in May and now awaits review by the Chamber of Deputies. It provides for use of modern investigative tools and techniques by Mexican law enforcement personnel, such as electronic surveillance and use of undercover operations, and also establishes a system for witness protection. These have been critical to our success against organized crime in the U.S. and we have long encouraged Mexico to consider adopting similar provisions. It is worth noting, too, that the Zedillo Government had to overcome considerable legal, even constitutional, obstacles, as well as to address public concerns about the potential for abuse of these new authorities.
We hope this important bill will pass soon so that the Government of Mexico can begin work on drafting and implementing regulations and to train its law enforcement personnel how to use the evidence obtained with these tools in criminal prosecution. Many of these regulations will involve significant departures from past practices and traditions. The government also plans to set up systems of checks and balances and other controls to prevent abuse of the new authorities by overzealous or corrupt government personnel. The U.S. has offered to provide training and technical assistance as part of a bilateral plan being developed under the auspices of the U.S.-Mexican High Level Contact Group on Narcotics Control.
The Zedillo Administration has also recognized the importance of developing an adequate reporting system for financial institutions. Pursuant to authorities provided by current money laundering legislation, the government is now drafting regulations that would require banks and other financial institutions to report suspicious transactions and large currency transactions to government authorities. The Mexican Government has established early 1997 as the target for implementing the suspicious transaction reporting (STR) requirements, to be followed by regulations for currency transaction reporting (CTR). However, the timely implementation of these regulations depends in part on Mexico's ability to procure specialized computers and software, which I will discuss in a moment.
Any discussion of Mexican law enforcement efforts must address the Zedillo Government's efforts to counter and control corruption. Both President Zedillo and Attorney General Lozano have publicly acknowledged that official corruption is a serious problem in the Mexican justice sector and have taken aggressive measures to counter it. This was a major objective of the reorganization of the Justice Ministry (PGR) in 1995. The firing of over 1,200 federal police agents for narco-corruption and other abuses is the second such mass dismissal since Zedillo took office; we view this as a promising development.
Moreover, the Mexican Government is taking greater steps to change both recruiting and personnel practices that contributed in the past to the spread of corruption; nonetheless, much more needs to be done to strengthen legal/judicial institutions. The U.S. has offered, and the Government of Mexico has accepted, training and technical assistance, and this will be expanded under the bilateral training plan. The Zedillo Government's progress in this important area to date is encouraging, but we will continue to stress the importance of meaningful and concrete action against narco and other corruption to the bilateral relationship.
Mexico's important legislative and other achievements are not themselves enough to address the threat of money laundering. The true test of the Zedillo Administration's willingness to combat money laundering is whether it will take concrete steps to implement the new laws, to adopt needed regulatory reform to supervise the financial system, to prosecute and convict money launderers in Mexico, and to seize and forfeit the assets involved. It is in these areas that the next phases of our diplomatic efforts are focused.
The Road Ahead
In the upcoming weeks and months, we will continue to move to address money laundering in Mexico. We will do so maintaining our bilateral dialogue with Mexico, supporting these efforts through technical assistance and training, and fully engaging in multilateral activities.
Bilateral Efforts: We are concentrating much of our bilateral dialogue in the High Level Contact Group process. As I noted earlier, within that framework we have formed a special sub-group to discuss specific anti-money laundering efforts and coordination issues with Mexican officials. This money laundering working group includes U.S. experts from the Departments of Treasury, State, and Justice, and Mexican experts from Treasury (Hacienda), Secretary of Foreign Relations (SRE), and the Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria). The general objectives of this group are to establish a forum in which both governments can, at a working level, candidly discuss ongoing initiatives to combat money laundering, and identify technical assistance and training that Mexican officials will require to adequately implement strong anti-money laundering measures. The group has already met twice this year, and will reconvene on a regular basis to discuss further issues such as information sharing, additional legislative and regulatory reforms, training and technical assistance and money laundering methodologies.
Training and Technical Assistance: We will support our bilateral discussions with targeted training and technical assistance. The U.S. is fortunate to have the best trained and most knowledgeable law enforcement and anti-money laundering experts in the world. Our law enforcement agencies have the benefit of decades of experience investigating and prosecuting money laundering in the U.S., more than virtually all other countries in the world. However, when attacking global money launderers, we know we must cooperate and coordinate with foreign law enforcement authorities, many of whom are ill equipped to undertake large financial investigations. We must be willing to provide our expertise to other nations as a way of accomplishing our goals. Our assistance is especially important in the anti-money laundering effort since these investigations in most instances are extremely complex and time consuming.
International law enforcement training is a critical component of U.S. foreign policy objectives. In undertaking international law enforcement training and technical assistance, particularly in anti-money laundering, the State Department has two basic goals in mind. The first is to build institutional expertise and capability in foreign countries so cooperation can increase. The second is to foster close working relationships between U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities.
We administer our international training and technical assistance programs consistent with U.S. foreign policy. Providing training and technical assistance to Mexican officials can only further our foreign policy and law enforcement interests in combating international money launderers. We do this recognizing that resources are limited and it is important to coordinate this assistance among the multiple U.S. law enforcement agencies that have expertise in this area.
Key objectives of the interagency money laundering working group ares to identifying both short and long-term training and technical assistance needs for Mexico and to insure that practical training and technical assistance is well coordinated among U.S. and Mexican agencies. Based on the first meeting in July 1996 and an initial assessment, the working group has recommended, and the State Department will provide support, to Mexico for the purchase of hardware and software in order for Hacienda to develop the necessary tools to handle Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs). We will also be supporting and coordinating with Justice and Treasury three to four training programs for PGR and Hacienda personnel among other short-term projects this year.
Although we have a wide range of initiatives ongoing to assist Mexico in combating money laundering, our investment in dollar terms is not large at this stage. As we identify other areas of technical assistance and training through the efforts of the money laundering working group, it is likely that additional funding will be required. All of our training efforts are designed to increase the capabilities of target countries to work effectively with our law enforcement officials and take the battle against organized crime groups to their home turf. As such, these programs further our law enforcement and foreign policy interests.
Multilateral Efforts: It is also important that we engage Mexico in multilateral fora. Not only can we encourage reform in Mexico through organizations such as the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and the OAS, but Mexico can also be an important ally as we work to establish international standards throughout this hemisphere and beyond.
Conclusion
Mr. Chairman, money laundering activity in Mexico poses a real threat to the national security of the United States, but it is an even bigger threat to the people of Mexico and their financial system. The Zedillo Administration has recognized this threat and is taking concrete steps to address it. So long as Mexico continues to demonstrate the political will to move forward, the Department of State and the law enforcement community will continue to work with and support it. We will continue to work with Mexico to ensure adoption of a comprehensive anti-money laundering regime. Indeed, our experts are meeting here in Washington next week to discuss the implementation and enforcement of its new anti-money laundering law. We will support these efforts with training and technical assistance where necessary. And we will continue to support and enhance joint law enforcement activity to attack the financial base of the drug cartels. It is only through effective regulation, law enforcement and cooperation on both sides of the border that we will be able to fight the drug traffickers and money launderers successfully.

Oklahoma produces agricultural products that are exported worldwide. In
2008, the State's farm cash receipts totaled $5.8 billion, and exports
were an estimated $1.6 billion. Agricultural exports help boost farm prices and
income, while supporting about 18,532 jobs both on the farm and off the farm in
food processing, storage, and transportation. Exports are increasingly important
to Oklahoma's agricultural and statewide economy. Measured as exports divided by
farm cash receipts, the State's reliance on agricultural exports was 27 percent
in 2008.
Oklahoma's top five agricultural exports in 2008 were:
World demand for these products is increasing, but so is competition among
suppliers. If Oklahoma's farmers, ranchers, and food processors are to compete
successfully for the export opportunities of the 21st century, they need fair
trade and more open access to growing global markets.
How Trade Agreements Benefit Oklahoma Agriculture
Oklahoma, the fifth largest wheat-producing state, benefited from limits set
on subsidized wheat exports as a result of the Uruguay Round agreement. These
limits influenced the European Union's imports, half of
which is supplied by the United States.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico eliminated import
licensing for wheat and is phasing out tariffs. Since 1994, average annual U.S.
wheat exports to Mexico have more than tripled, from 23 million bushels to 85
million bushels, valued at $349 million in 2002.

Export Success Stories
The Oklahoma wheat industry has benefited from the efforts of the U.S. Wheat
Associates to market U.S. hard red winter wheat to Nigeria. Currently 90 percent
of this wheat variety imported into Nigeria comes from the United States.

Stinking It Up: Lessons From a PR Failure
We had a big party, but got no buzz. Lessons from a PR failure.
I've been thinking a lot about poop lately, and not just because I have two young kids. In particular, I've been pondering that clichéd philosophical question: If a bear poops in the woods and nobody's around, does it still stink?
Recently, DoSomething.org hosted what I'd normally consider a successful party. The event raised half a million dollars. We honored five amazing youths for doing amazing things, from building an orphanage in Nepal to registering thousands of new voters. (Read their stories at FastCompany.com.) Our red carpet at Harlem's Apollo Theater was packed with celebs, and performers including Boys Like Girls and Akon -- who crowdsurfed -- rocked the place. The 1,600 people there were floored. But did anybody else smell what we were cooking? Nope.
Our event PR, it turns out, was crappy. We generated almost no buzz. For the time, energy, and money that go into an event, it ought to reach well beyond the room. You want that poop in the woods to stink far and wide.
After the event, I sat down with my staff to analyze what went wrong and then I called some PR experts for advice. Given how many other organizations -- for-profit and not-for-profit -- do events, I thought the lessons might be worth sharing. Here's what we'll do next time.
Do some digging. We ended up with some run-of-the-mill photos, but Tess Finkle of Metro PR says our shots could have been better had we done more research: Find a juicy story. Get the photo. Were there people in the room who once dated? Which people were meeting for the first time? (The answer was yes: Boys Like Girls have a pet turtle named Dorota, named after the Gossip Girl character, and they met Zuzanna Szadkowski, who plays Dorota, at the event. Unfortunately, I have no photo.)
Be exclusive. We had celebs at the event, but we didn't exploit them well. Nobody loves exclusivity more than the media, so give a blog, a TV outlet, and a magazine one-on-ones with the night's big names. The sidebar exclusives benefit the talent, too: It's a chance to build their bleeding-heart brands.
Get help. Especially for youth-focused orgs like mine, the Web is crucial. Next time, I'll give free flights and hotel to Fred Figglehorn, the 16-year-old You-Tube star with more than 55 million views and 276,000 MySpace friends. And Lisa Witter, COO of Fenton Communications, told me to think beyond "official" bloggers: "You've got a zillion Facebook friends and Twitter followers. Don't forget to recruit them. You never know who has what friend." Had our 18 staffers and 12 interns utilized their Facebook networks, we would have reached 12,781 people.
Feed the paparazzi. I don't mean stories or photo ops. One of our interns gave cupcakes to the voracious photographers who were shooting our red carpet. Smart kid. Good move. I'm told those photogs will remember us now -- and we want as many of them as we can to come back for our next event.
Make your own paparazzi. At most events, they tell you to turn your cell phones off. Next year, I'll ask the crowd to turn them on. Then they can take photos, tweet, upload clips, and update their Facebook statuses. A key to maximizing the multimedia maelstrom, says Attention PR's Naomi Hirabayashi, is to "ask those people to use the same keywords in titles. It will make it easier for you to search for those items later."
Strategize ... after the event. Right after the event (as in that night), gather the staff to review what happened -- and I don't mean what went wrong. What nuggets of info did each of us collect? Nick Cannon presented an award while on a "bathroom break" from an event where he was accompanying his wife, Mariah Carey? Really? Is that a Perez Hilton item? Or maybe we'd rather give him the bit about the Real Housewives of New York City and send Nick to People.com. This is exactly why all the items need to be collected quickly and divvied up strategically.
Follow up. This doesn't just mean pestering people to write stories, which we did. When those stories show up online, it means Digging, retweeting, forwarding, and using every other tech tool out there to spread the word.
And having a column in Fast Company doesn't hurt either.

FBI: Hotel Internet Connections Unsafe
News updates all day from your Fast Company editors.
The government agency known as the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) just went public with the news that the FBI is investigating multiple cases of malware installed via hotel Internet connections.
According to the IC3, travelers' laptops have been infected with malware after using hotel Internet connections--guests logging in to hotel networks were given prompts to update "a widely used software product." The IC3 did not specify at what hotels or in what countries the attacks took place, but warned that government, private industry, and academic personnel traveling abroad pay special attention to any anomalies on their hotel Internet connection.

No. 28 Florida Atlantic University won its 17th straight consecutive game, beating Atlantic Sun member Jacksonville State University 12-3. FAU improves to 24-6, 7-0 A- Sun while JSU falls to 13-15, 1-8 A-Sun.
FAU starter Chris Pillsbury pitched five innings, struck out two and walked only one to earn his sixth win of the season and remain undefeated. He was relieved by James Callahan, Jim Cooney and Matt O'Brien. The trio struck out four and gave up two earned runs.
After allowing the lead off hitters to get on base in the first three innings, Pillsbury worked out of the jam each time with a double-play. He ended the lead off streak in the fourth when he recorded his two strikeouts.
After scoring eight runs in the first two innings, Florida Atlantic was held hitless in the third and fourth. With two outs in the first Mike Cox posted a single to put two men on for Atlantic Sun Player-of-the-Week, Matt Pali. Pali hit his seventh homer of the season and posted three RBI on the play.
The second inning looked almost identical. Gabe Somarriba hit his third home run to right-center field with two on to give FAU a 7-0 lead. Somarriba led the team with three RBI. FAU would score two more earned runs in the sixth after Mike Valdes delivered a double to start the inning.
Bobby Spano went 2-for-2 with two walks to increase his team-leading walk total to 26.
JSU tallied three runs in the last four innings as they collected five hits off of the FAU relievers.
Only two of the runs were earned.

no, minifigs must be kept whole and be an official lego released minifig. no custom figures, even if you frankenstein a minifigure out of official elements, it won't be allowed.

All of the Lone Ranger sets were on display, although the minifigures for 4 of the sets were not present at the Toy Fair ... they were all replaced with standard yellow figures. The release date were were given was 19th July, although the dealer catalogue I have suggests May. The sets overall looked really good and may we drive a resurgence is interest in cowboy themes. The guy who was showing us these sets said that the Lone Ranger figure is different in each set, although I can't vouch for that as we didn't see all the variants.
79106 Cavalry Builder Set ... a nice little "battle pack" set, with 3 cavalry figure and the Lone Ranger. Comes with a horse (the one that can rear up, that first came in the LOTR sets) and a small fort & cannon. Price point £11.99.
79107 Comanche Camp ... a set consisting of a wigwam, canoe and a scorpion pit. Comes with 3 figures, Lone Ranger, Tonto and Chief Redmeat (if I heard my audio recording correctly). Price point £19.99.
79108 Stagecoach Escape ... a pretty nice looking stagecoach (with proper suspension), featuring 5 minifigures ... Tonto, Lone Ranger, 2 bad guys and Red Harrington, plus 3 horses. Apparently, the safe that's on top of the Stagecoach was a Lego invention and they liked it so much, they put it in the film! Price point £29.99.
79109 Colby City Showdown ... a bank and a jail, both of which have plenty of play features where parts of the sets will blow up ... a safe, the front of the bank and the jail cell. Figures include 2 bad guys, Dan Reid, Tonto and the Lone Ranger. Price point £39.99.
79110 Silver Mine Shootout ... a pretty nice playset, again featuring parts of the set that will blow up. Set features Tonto, the Lone Ranger, 2 baddies and another Indian. There seemed to be some nice chrome silver parts too (Coins, bullion bars etc), which is the treasure the baddie is trying to steal, I assume. Price point £69.99.
79111 Constitution Train Chase ... a great looking train, including a complete circle of track and seven minifigures - Rebecca Reid, Tonto, Lone Ranger, Rebecca Reid's son, cavalry officer (that had a rather nice cavalry hat and hair mold) and another bad guy who also has a working gattling gun, which was a good play feature indeed. Price point £79.99.

FCS Diversity and Inclusion - PROPOSED RULE - MARCH 2011
Dear Mr. Van Meter,
As the President of Kirschenmann Family Farms in North Dakota I know how important affordable capital is for the next generation of farmers to enter the farming business. We have a young family managing our farm for us in North Dakota and it is my goal to have them eventually own enough of the farm so they can support their own family into the future. Since North Dakota is the only state with a state owned bank, the state has had the opportunity to launch a lending program for beginning farmers which
makes capital available to them at a little below 2% interest. This has made a huge difference. This young family now owns 240 acres of our farm with a farmstead and we look forward to them owning more of it shortly. Low interest loans, I believe, are critical to sustaining an adequate farm population to meet our food production needs. and as we are learning almost every day, farmers producing food in and for thier own communities is becoming increasingly critical to the food security ofour
communities. So I hope the FCS will support the effort to make low interest loans available to small and midsize farmers.

I just love this picture of my Allie and her Paperback Pup. The lighting, the curls, her little lips and chubby cheeks, I love it.
She has her father’s nose and high forehead.
I think she was watching television. She is obsessed with tv to my chagrin. Every time we’re in the living room, she picks up the remote and says, More? More?
When I tell her “No more,” she asks again. More? More?
This repeats at least five times before she gets mad and walks away or I give in and turn on the tv.
As part of my ongoing relationship with Build-A-Bear Workshop, we get new furry friends every month. This one, Paperback Pup, is especially dear to Allie. She toddles around the house every day with him tucked under her arm.
When she puts him back and then rediscovers him a few minutes later, her face lights up, and she says Woof! Woof! Puppy! Woof! Woof!
She is communicating really well all of a sudden after almost no words for many months.
We made her a cat at Grace’s Build-A-Bear birthday party, and she treats it the same way. Sometimes, she carries both. It’s quite a sight since each one is close to her size. I haven’t gotten a picture of that yet, but I hope to.

Hi ladies. Hope everyone is doing ok on this wet and windy Monday! I went for a scan today. Had a trans vaginal ultra sound to look at my tubes and ovaries. I'm CD 12 today. My right ovary was doing nothing my left ovary had got a small number of small follicles. The biggest was 13mm which is small for mid cycle but my lining looked good. My tubes also looked clear
Any thoughts? This is a natural cycle. I'll see the doc half way through next cycle to discuss going to the next level of tx.
What do people think. My last cycle was 32 days so could it be a late ovulation or am I too inactive on my old ovaries to achieve anything???
Thanks

Depends on how long your cycles are, but i am a 31 day- 32 day cycle and i got lh surge on cycle day 13 and 14, could just be an off month, i think on natural cycles a follicle is supposed to be a bit bigger than that, did they check your LH levels or anything?

We were fortunate to have Dr. Mohammad M. Maula from Harrisburg Area Community College teach Environmental Science at FGCC in the fall term of 2011.
I would like to highlight a few milestones in Dr. Maula’s life. He got a M. Sc. in Zoology from the University of Kalyani, West Bengal, India. He then lectured at Surendranath College in Kolkata, India for 20 years. From 1976 to 1985 Dr. Maula studied German at the Goethe Institut in Kolkata and in 1980 Dr. Maula spent some time at the Goethe Institut in Schwäbisch Hall, Germany. In 1982 he received the Lehrersprachdiplom and taught “Deutsch als Fremsprache” for 4 years. In 1985 Dr. Maula went to the USA and in 1993 he completed a Ph.D. in Zoology (Marine Biology) at the University of Maryland at College Park. After being a Postdoctoral Fellow at Howard University, Washington, DC, he became an Associate Professor of Zoology at Voorhees College, South Carolina in 1994. Then in August 1997 he became a Professor of Biology at Lancaster Campus of the Harrisburg Area Community College.
And here now some pictures of Dr. Maula lecturing at FGCC.

Once again FHS girls achieved extremely impressive A Level grades with 21.4% of results at the new A* grade. The total of 85.7 % of grades at A*/A/ B surpassed last year's very good results.
Despite the concern in the press about the shortage of university places, our girls have almost all achieved places at their chosen universities.
Congratulations to all of our Upper Sixth and we wish them every success in the future.
Well done also to our Year 11 who achieved a very creditable set of GCSE results too.

Bio: I was at the beach six years ago telling my friend one of my stories and she urged me to begin writing, and then and there I decided to follow my dreams. I love to write spellbinding novels that sweeps my readers away taking them on a sensual adventures filled with perilous mysteries, and heart stopping passion in another place and time.
I love anything that has to do with the ocean, mountains, nature, animals, and Native American culture. I come from a mixed heritage of Cherokee, Choctaw, Irish, Scottish and Jewish, and was raised and still reside in Alabama. My greatest love in life are my two children who I adore. I love to write and feel my stories are an incredible gift that I get to share. Never give up on your dreams?because dreams do come true.

South Carolina points finger at lack of encryption
The full scope of the massive data breach of the South Carolina Department of Revenue is still making headlines.
The data included 3.8 million social security numbers and information on 1.9 million dependants. Information from 699,900 businesses was compromised, along with 3.3 million bank accounts and 5,000 credit card numbers.
The data was stolen by a pretty prosaic method. An employee opened an email sent by a phisher, which allowed the phisher to obtain a username and password to access the system via Citrix.
"From there, the hacker installed various tools that captured user account passwords on six servers. The hacker eventually gained access to three dozen other systems…The hacker used at least 33 unique utilities and malware, including password dumping tools, administrative utilities, batch scripts, and generic database command utilities. The hacker used a utility called 7-Zip to compress information, creating 15 encrypted archived files that, if uncompressed, contained 74.7GB of data. The data was moved to another server within DOR before it was eventually moved to another system on the Internet," according to a story in IDG.
Unfortunately, some of the most sensitive information, such as SSNs, was unencrypted. For this oversight, the state is pointing its finger at the IRS. The governor has written to the IRS asking that it require that all SSNs are encrypted. There is nothing preventing states from going above and beyond current requirements, and the state has plans to move to encryption all on its own.
This is a wake up call for other states. States near South Carolina were quick to point out that they already encrypt all data. Encryption as preventative measure is hard to argue against. Consider NASA, which is moving to implement full disk encryption on agency laptops after one containing unencrypted personal information on a 'large' number of people was recently stolen. The laptop was stolen from a locked car.

Czech Republic 4-8 Portugal: Joel's finishing just too hot
With this emphatic win, Portugal have set up a titanic Iberian struggle to decide who goes through to the semi-finals of the FIFA Futsal World Championship Chinese Taipei 2004.
"Our strategy was to press the Czechs in the middle of the court but we failed to do that at times in the first half. But after half-time we got that sorted and I was very pleased with our finishing tonight," said a contented Portuguese coach Orlando Duarte afterwards.
Portugal came into this game a point ahead of the Czech Republic after their creditable 0-0 draw with Italy. This result looked even more impressive after the Azzurri beat the World Champions in the preceeding match.
Spain coach Javier Lozano had named Portugal as one of the five teams who could win the tournament. They started in fine style - Joel Queiros steering Goncalo's lob through Jan Klima's legs.
The Czech's appeared unconcerned that Lozano had not mentioned them in his famous five. They hit back within three minutes - Vit Blazej volleying in Michal Mares' free-kick. Portugal's lead was restored when the excellent Joel Queiros was left unmarked to slot in at the far post.
The Czech Republic hadn't read the script and Orlando Duarte's team seemed uncharacteristically slack in defence. Michal Striz's charges hit back to lead 3-2 - David Levcik worked superbly down the right to square for a tap-in for Roman Musial and Daniel Rajnoch's pass was expertly controlled his thigh and dispatched by Martin Dlouhy.
The counter attacking game of the East Europeans was causing Portugal problems, but they received a boost just on half-time as Ivan toe-poked into the top corner to send the sides in 3-3 at the break.
Duarte's half-time talk certainly had an effect - his team went 5-3 ahead just two minutes into the second half. Goncalo's fierce left wing cross found skipper Andre tearing in at the far post to volley home, then a fine move involving Joel Queiros, Andre and Goncalo saw the latter give his side a two goal advantage.
From here the game seemed relatively easy for Portugal. They were able to soak up the Czech pressure and twice more they caught them on the break with picture-book goals - Ivan nutmegging a defender with his pass for Leo to score coolly, then a great dummy by Israel left him in space to collect Leo's long pass and although Klima stopped his effort, Goncalo followed up to score. Blazej's made it 4-7 with a clever toe-poke over the dives of both Ivan and Joao Benedito, before Joel Queiros made it 8-4 and a hat-trick from the 10m mark.
"The goal just before half-time and the two immediately afterwards cost us the game. I am very proud of our team - don't forget we are all amateurs playing against three professional outfits," Czech coach Michal Striz said after the game.

Bayern sweep four past Nurnberg
Bayern Munich extended their lead at the top of the Bundesliga with another comfortable victory, this time beating local rivals Nurnberg 4-0 at the Allianz Arena.
Mario Gomez scored a brace, while Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery were also on target for the home side, who eased through the second half with their UEFA Champions League tie against Napoli next Wednesday in sight.
Nurnberg never posed a threat to Manuel Neuer's goal as the Bayern goalkeeper kept yet another clean sheet, his ninth of the season in the league.
Bayern were ahead after just 85 seconds when Gomez headed in Schweinsteiger's cross from the right wing, and Gomez then turned provider for Schweinsteiger for the second goal in the 19th minute.
A good exchange between Ribery and Philipp Lahm down the left allowed the Bayern full-back to enter the area and pull the ball back for Gomez, who laid it off for Schweinsteiger to finish from over 20 yards.
As if Bayern were not dominant enough, Timmy Simons almost helped them out by going close to scoring an own goal in the 25th minute. Bayern did not need any favours, though, even if Ribery was invited to make one of his trademark runs in from the left before shooting past Alexander Stephan to score their third in the 39th minute.
Gomez almost made it four in the 66th when he took the ball past Stephan, but Philipp Wohlscheid was covering to clear the ball away from the open goal and behind for a corner.
The German international did score the fourth two minutes later, though. Toni Kroos raced through from what appeared to be an offside position and took the ball to the goal line before crossing low to Gomez, who tapped in with his left foot from point-blank range.
It was Bayern's 30th goal in 11 matches and enough for them to win their eighth game to establish a four-point advantage over Schalke at the top of the table.

ARMY is wary of the Rika brothers in the Sarafui team ahead of their clash in the Suva Cricket Association (SCA) club competition semi-finals at Albert Park tomorrow.
The defending champions are the hot favourites to retain the title but team manager Akuila Nawai said the Rika brothers and Sarafui team manager/player Alex Konrote would be the force to reckon with in the decider.
Former Fiji skipper Joe Rika joined his brother Colin in Sarafui this year and many believe his inclusion helped the team reach the semi-final stage after a long time.
Nawai said the HMT-sponsored Army was not underestimating Sarafui especially after the latter's brilliant performance last season.
"We look forward to a tough game and hope Sarafui gives us stiff competition. In cricket anything can happen and we are not taking Sarafui lightly," he said.
Nawai said the team was focusing on getting the players' fitness back on top following a two-week break last month.
He said the players were given leave during the festive season and they resumed training from this week.
"The focus is on the basic skills of cricket. The main factor is fitness and we are hoping to improve it by Saturday," Nawai said.

A MAN who initially pleaded guilty to murder yesterday has been given time by the High Court in Labasa to reconsider his plea.
Justice Daniel Goundar asked Mohammed Shahim to reassess his plea after learning of his background of poverty.
Shahim allegedly killed a five-year-old boy with his fist on January 28 last year.
Yesterday he was represented by Legal Aid lawyer Mele Lemaki.
Mr Shahim told the court he had lived in a two-bedroom house in Labasa without electricity supply with his five children and three adults, and depended on homegrown vegetables for meals.
He said his family earned about $40 a week and that they usually fetched water from a nearby well for drinking, washing and cooking. Mr Shahim said the victim and his mother moved in with them for about one year before he decided to chase them away.
Justice Goundar said it was only proper for the accused to think about his plea carefully so he wouldn't regret it later.
"Be mindful that the maximum sentence for murder is life imprisonment and I don't want you to regret pleading guilty to the charge for the rest of your life," he said.
State lawyer Sekonaia Vodokisolomone did not object to the decision.
Justice Goundar demanded the presence of the victim's mother in court for evidence.
He told Mr Shahim to seek forgiveness from the victim's mother so he would have peace.
The case will be called again at 10am today.

Anticipation can be a bitch. Expectations can lead to disappointment. Hype can be a killer. Christopher Nolan’s epic conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy has to deal with all three nuisances, and he flicks them aside like villain Bane does Batman, the entire Gotham police force and everyone else who makes the mistake of crossing his path.

Read FilmJabber’s full Cars 2 in a London slum overrun by teen violence.Â Similar to Matthieu Kassovitz’ great film La Haine, Harry Brown provides a strong commentary on teen violence and the cyclical nature of violence, while never feeling heavy-handed.Â As opposed to La Haine, which tells the story from the viewpoint of three rough-and-tough youths, Harry Brown is told primarily through the eyes of Harry, an elderly man who takes it upon himself to help clean up the streets after his good friend is beaten to death by hoodlums,.Â While not as visually striking as Kassovitz’ film, director Daniel Barber takes what could have been a very generic story and infuses it with an energy that continuously pushes the film to the brink of acceptability, keeping the audience both entertained and unsettled at all times.

SXSW 2012 Review: ‘Just Like Being There’ Pays Tribute to Modern Art’s True Heroes, Struggles to Find FocusMovie Review By Neil Miller on March 12, 2012 | Be the First To Comment media. From mp3 downloads to streaming films to podcasts and the like, we spend so much of our time consuming everything we can get our hands on. Lost, in so many instances, are the opportunities to experience things. So in those increasingly rare instances — that time you saw The Black Keys play in a basement in Akron, Ohio, the time Tokyo Police Club played that tiny club in Buffalo, NY — it’s wonderful to have connective tissue to that experience. Such is the brilliance of a good gig poster. One look and you’re transported back to that experience. And the emotion you feel for that experience is no different than the emotion expended to make said poster. Therein lies the brilliance of what is exposed within Scout Shannon’s directorial debut: it’s not about the art, so much as it is about how the art makes us feel.

Dr. No
Upon realising that I have not written many James Bond related film reviews in my time at FilmsClick, I have decided that it’s high time we introduced a project I have been secretly working on for quite some time. In celebration of this amazing British franchise I will be reviewing the first official 20 Bond films – one per day – starting all the way at the beginning with the first official movie, Dr No, and finishing up with the 20th, Die Another Day.
In 1962 when Harry Saltzman and Albert “Cubby” Broccoli decided to bring Ian Fleming’s fictional super spy James Bond to the big screen they perfectly cast Sean Connery for the role. After much consideration for many actors, Sean Connery was chosen despite being practically unknown and he kicked off what has been the most successful film series of all time with Dr. No.
The story sees James Bond (Sean Connery) being sent over to Jamaica in order to investigate mysterious radioactive waves which are interfering with the U.S. missile launches, as well as the disappearance of a colleague. With charm, style, action and wit 007 locates Dr. No’s lair and with the assistance of the beautiful Honey Rider (Ursula Andress) defeats him, as you might suspect, in a great final bout.
Dr. No is regularly misunderstood as a Bond film and for whatever reason is often given appallingly low ratings. I personally love it. Dr No is very stylish, incredibly cool, and Connery’s intro is a masterpiece in film making; in fact this is often considered to be one of the coolest character introductions in cinematic history.

If you believe in capitalism, like this woman probably does, than you have to believe a few things.
1. To become rich, you must be talented and intelligent.
2. Major corporate heads and Wall Street players are rich and donate to the Obama campaign.
So either they hate the own system they profited from or they are sadists. Either way it is dumb. Obama is one of the most right-wing Presidents we have ever had.

Ole and Mari Finnestad had 11 children (7 girls & 4 boys).
Maria and Barnel died as infants in Norway.
Bert died in Outlook, Saskatchewan.
The rest of the Finnestad siblings died in the United States. I have posted photos of all of the headstones except for Maria and Barnel in Norway, Elizabeth and Rachel (those will be forthcoming) and the twins, Iverdine and Bertha.
While I know the dates Iverdine and Bertha passed away, I've been unable to locate their final resting place. However, the other night I decided to go through the Calvary Lutheran Church records and located confirmation of Bertha's burial.
According to the church records, Bertha's husband, Ole Andreas Haaland handled the burial on April 30, 1929. While funeral services may have been held at the church, I am waiting on confirmation from the Union Cemetery sexton (next door to the church) and the funeral home, Unger Horner to verify the location of burial. I'm not sure Unger Horner handled either funeral but they did handle many of the Finnestad family.

Even).
Since losing to Longford Town on May 11th last, Waterford have won all eight games since then – seven in the league and one in the FAI Cup. Two of their last three games have seen them beat the top two of Limerick and Longford and they go into Friday’s game just four points off the top of the table.
Harps go into the game on the back of a three game unbeaten run with their only defeats in the last six games coming at the hands of the top two.
Last weekend, Harps looked like they had pulled off the perfect comeback in coming from 2-0 down against Wexford Youths at Finn Park, only for the visitors to snatch a last gasp equaliser with the last kick of the game to share the spoils in a highly entertaining 3-3 draw.
“It felt like a defeat, given that we had done so well to get back into the game,” said Harps boss Peter Hutton of the game.
“We gave them a two goal start and we worked extremely hard to get back into the game and take a 3-2 lead. So to throw it away with literally the last kick of the game is devastating. It’s very hard on the boys. For all their effort and endeavour they only get a point rather than the three.
“It would have been a massive three points,” said Hutton. It shows the exceptional resilience and character of the boys to get themselves back into he game and into a leading position. But I suppose you have to say, fair play to Wexford too. They just kept plugging away and unfortunately we didn’t clear our lines with seconds to go. It was probably a bit of inexperience and naivety as well. We tried to stay on the ball when we shouldn’t have, we should have just put it out and over the stand. Even the equaliser, it was so fortuitous. The boy just hits a shot and it comes off James Doherty’s heel and just loops up over Ciaran (Gallagher).”
Although Harps haven’t the best of records at the RSC against Waterford, their last two visits there have seen them unbeaten. In September last year, Harps left with a share of the spoils after a scoreless draw. Earlier this season, on the last day of March, a Paul Simon Tracey strike coupled with a Waterford own goal was enough to give Harps a 2-0 victory – their first in Waterford since 2001.
“We’ll look forward to it. We won there the last time, it was the time Ciaran Gallagher got the bad injury,” Hutton said of the trip to the south-east.
“It’s a good venue and a good pitch. Waterford are on a great run at the moment. They are one of the form teams, themselves and Limerick. They are up there and for a lot of people they were possible candidates for promotion this year. You can see now why, they are getting bodies back that they didn’t have for much of the season.
“But we fear no-one. I think there is a very fine line in regards to the rest of the teams in the league. If we acquit ourselves like we did for the second half and the last 15 minutes of the first half (against Wexford), then I think we’ll give them a right good game.”

"There are no red flags," he said.
All of the affected businesses experienced smoke and water damage, he said. The plaza's facade took the brunt of the flames, forcing demolition crews to strip it off Tuesday for safety.
Sean Jones, fire rescue chief at Natrona Heights Citizens Hose Company, said it took crews more than three hours Monday night to control the flames, which officials believe started between J&S Pizza and a vacant business where a sleep clinic was about to open.
He said investigators estimated the damage at $10 million Tuesday. Up to 15 businesses were affected.
Three firefighters were treated for medical issues resulting from the stress of the fire, Chief Jones said. Two for chest pain were admitted to the hospital and one complaining of nausea was released.
The fire rekindled at the State Farm insurance building before 10 a.m. Tuesday, but crews were able to contain it in minutes, Chief Jones said. Firefighters also poured water atop the Dollar Bank, where people reported seeing smoke that morning.
Thirty fire companies responded.
"Besides the loss of tax revenue, it's going to affect a lot of families," said Harrison commission President George Conroy.
Chief Jones estimated at least 100 people would be out of work, including 35 to 40 J&S Pizza employees.
"This is the anchor store of this whole plaza," said owner Debora Malvone.
A Christmas tree stood intact inside the restaurant -- but unlit, as the affected stores remained without power.
Mr. Brucker said the direction of the wind Monday night blew the flames in such a way they more heavily damaged the facade of the shops near the end of the plaza.
Extra security on was duty Tuesday while crews were working, Chief Jones said. All the businesses are insured, he added, but Mr. Brucker said it will take time to contact each insurer.
Heights Plaza was built in the 1950s, and residents remember the mall as a location once popular for retail shopping and community activities around the holidays.

We’ve all been there.
In a queue. Waiting.
You’re watching everyone else get served and asking yourself, why can’t they make this faster? Why can’t they put more staff on? Why is my time being wasted in this queue?
You might be surprised to learn that the time you spend waiting in that queue has been mathematically calculated.
That’s right.
That place where you’re waiting knows exactly how long you will spend on hold, or standing in line and they balance that time against customer satisfaction levels…
The Simple Truth About Customer Satisfaction meet their expectations. They are really satisfied when you exceed their expectations but the simple truth behind happy customers is how well you set their expectations in the first place. Let me explain this marketing plan in more detail.
A Little Bit Of Little Goes A Long, Long Way
First up, let’s get the mathematics out of the way. Queuing theory is the study of queues. It sounds exciting doesn’t it? And you thought your job was boring. But in fact, queuing theory can tell us a lot of quite interesting information like fast your customers rock up to a queue, how long they have to wait and how quickly they are being served.
You can probably see that all these things are a pretty good indicator of how well your whole service delivery process is working.
In 1961 John Little realised that to reduce the length of a queue, you need to slow arrivals and you need to speed exits up. It sounds obvious doesn’t it? Little’s Law tells you how to reduce the size of your queue and it innovated a new way of thinking about the mechanisms of service delivery.
But what if you could make customers happy about being in the queue.
The Secret To Making Your Customers Queue Happily
Clearly it’s important to look for way to improve your service delivery process. While you’re doing that you can improve customer satisfaction levels by simply changing your customers’ perception of waiting.
Let them know how long they will have to wait.
Have you ever been on hold and heard the robot lady tell you that you are 5th in the queue and your waiting time is approximately 7minutes. Or the same voice telling you that the average waiting time right now is 17minutes. This is the information you use to decide to hang on or hang up – and thus your expectations are defined. When your call gets answered in 11minutes, you’re delighted!
Or you take a ticket and you see a big counter on the wall, calling the next number in the queue. You can see the progress being made and how quickly the numbers are changing, and from this you can work out how long you have to wait. There is no queue jumping either. It’s an orderly (if boring) wait for service.
Of course letting your customers know how long they can expect to wait will only work in your favour if the wait time is within their “acceptable wait” time for the value you offer.
Give your customers something to do while they are waiting.
This one is the secret gem of great customer satisfaction because it allows customers to become engaged in the process. And that helps them become connected to the outcome. They’re part of the results and that gives them a spot at the start of the tickertape parade that is their buying experience.
Regardless of whether you have a physical store, or you are online, never under-estimate the power of being part of the process in terms of customer satisfaction levels, even if it’s at a seemingly trivial level.
What it means in real life…
If you often have customers waiting in a physical location, look for ways to take any randomness out of the waiting process. Uncertainty causes anxiety, which leads all the way to angry customers!
Structure is the key. By adding some structure and surety to your customers wait time you will definitely boost your customer satisfaction levels.
- Acknowledge customers on arrival and let them know if there is a wait time
- Use a ticketing system that lets customer move around while maintaining their “spot”
- Take waiting customers past interesting (and distracting) displays
- Invite customers to participate in questionnaires or competitions while they wait
What it means online…
Even if you don’t have customers forming a literal queue, a virtual queue can quite easily form when you’re busy. Well done you if you’re busy but when you work online, it’s easy to miss the signals that your customers are getting annoyed…. Until they’ve gone to your competitor.
Transparency is the key. When you let your customers see that something is happening, you’re giving them the free set of steak knives of customer satisfaction.
- Look for non-essential milestones you can bring forward to get the ball rolling
- Create a delivery schedule so your customers know when they’ll hear from you
- Break your service into smaller segments and get customer involvement at each stage
- Regularly get in touch and keep your customers in the loop
Improving Customer Service Is Only Half The Solution
While you might prefer to pull out your eyelashes than read about the mathematics of queuing theory, you should be looking for ways to shorten your queue and delight your customers with amazing, personal, diligent customer service.
After you’ve improved your service delivery to the best it can possibly be, you can sky rocket their customer satisfaction by accurately setting expectations and helping them define what “satisfied” means.
When you do that, your customers will be happy before you deliver a single thing.
Do you think you can rock your customers’ world?.

Great Article!
Setting expectations is such an important part of good business. Too many people over promise and under deliver…
Instead just say, “You’re going to have to wait 3 minutes… Go get a cup of coffee and then we’ll get you a solution.”
Thanks,
Ryan H.
Belinda! Great stuff! When I started reading I thought this one going to be about that service-debacle copyblogger covered (omg, that was painful lol –
)
I’m pleased it was about queue theory, and it was extremely enlightening. There are many things I could apply from this.
I tend to focus on clarity, and see the deeper roots of any expression, and to me the deeper roots of this is a “focus on making the customers journey more joyful”.
If someone is focused on making the customers journey more joyful, they would basically HAVE to apply some queue theory eventually
So thank you, for helping me make my clients journey better, Belinda. You rock!
Hey Jason. Enlightening is fantastic feedback – thank you!
I love your idea about making the journey more *joyful* (doesn’t gamification follow this idea?) . Having been on many, many driving holidays as a child I always used to hear “the journey is just as important as the destination” (closely followed with “stop complaining”
Some customers will let the journey form their opinion of your service. Some will only care about the solution you leave them with. To make sure you capture the loyalty of both groups you should place your focus on both.
Keep bringing joy Jason!
My pleasure, and childhood wisdom is powerful
As for the two groups you outlined, I’d wager that if you were to take the ones who “only care about the solution” and put another solution in front of them with an understanbly more enjoyable journey… they WOULD join the first group
Just a hunch
Ryze up!
I actually think that the Copyblogger reference is related. If memory serves, that post suggests that most disputes can be easily resolved with kindness – or good manners. I resent waiting in a queue FAR less when I receive great customer service and attention (and even an apology for having to wait) once I’m at the teller. If you can mitigate the more frustrating (and often unavoidable) parts of doing business with a sunny disposition, exceptional products and services, and an acknowledgement of that frustration, I think you’re in good shape.
Agreed Ruth! Well said. Kindness helps so much
Thanks for the story (and acknowledgment)
And for the record, I wasn’t saying it wasn’t related, I just meant I’d read the copyblogger thing, and the intro paragraph felt very similar , my pre-conceived notions were doing their thing lol.
Yep I absolutely agree Ruth. Good (and timely) manners can help take you the distance and that’s the potential simplicity behind this idea. You don’t have to have expensive ticketing systems. What every service delivery process needs is to keep your customers’ needs front and centre.
Thanks for commenting!
Great post Belinda! Although I don’t have an actual queue that people have to wait it, it did get me thinking about my biz & what I can do to give my customers a better experience when it comes to waiting on services or coaching.
I always contact everyone with a personal email after they purchase something & let them know when they can expect it, but I never considered giving them something to do while they wait. So my plan is to link them to awesome info on my blog that has to do with what they’re looking for from me so they can be reading on that until we have our coaching session or they get one of my programs. Thanks so much for the idea!
That’s a fantastic application Meagan. I have a similar “virtual” queue and might just pinch your ‘read these related blogs’ idea! By personalising the information you are pointing them to, so that it’s relevant to their scenario, you are also personalising your service which is a win-win!
Thanks for sharing your thoughts!
You’re welcome & pinch away!
Someone should have told to John Little that to reduce queues you just have to have more employers, or faster ones.
I see your point and it’s interesting but if I don’t know if a customer needs and wants something else than a quick answer. I mean while letting him know how much time he has to wait for an answer is correct being entertained might just make him angry. That’s why those who provide an answer in minutes, at least online, are at the top of their business. Provided the answer received comes from someone who knows what he’s talking about.
WWhat do you think?
Ooh, that’s a great thought, hypnodude.
I think really knowing your customers/clients especially works hand-in-hand with this idea. One customer could have the patience of Job and be willing to have some fun throughout the process, but another customer might want it and want it *now*. You’d definitely have to pinpoint the type of customer you’re working with, and the kind of relationship you have with them, in order to really be successful with this.
Plus, I also agree that it’s important to establish where you stand right away and provide an answer from the get-go, first. Like you said Belinda, it’s about defining expectations.
Thanks Tanya. You’re right, actually on the net I don’t have customers but just readers anyway knowing your audience is surely the first thing to do and then act accordingly for a mutual satisfaction.
Belinda, what an awesome idea! Takes me back to waiting on the phone for tech support.
This is something I can really use, at the very least in my author/writer interactions. I’m always beta reading novel manuscripts for friends, but I’m also always doing a million things at once. I feel just awful during the times I keep them waiting in their “queue” for long periods of time, so I see now that it would be great for me to work on ideas to keep them engaged while I’m still working on it. Even lately I’ve done it on an unconscious level, giving a writer friend small updates on my thoughts while I work on the larger project as a whole.
I’m excited to look at this in different ways though, see how else and in what other areas business-wise I can apply this. Thanks for a super post! I really enjoyed it.
Great application Tanya.
I think that if a client has to chase me up then I’ve failed because I didn’t get them a clear roadmap or I’m not sticking to my roadmap. Just chatting to them about their project shows them that you’re doing something which is a bridge over the empty “what’s going on” void that leads to frustration.
Thanks for sharing your experience. I’d love to learn any new ways you find to apply the idea!
Hey hypnodude, Knowing your customers’ pain points is really important if you are going to deliver outstanding service.
In the scenario you detailed it sounds like time is a critical factor. If your customers need a quick answer you should do everything in your power to provide it. If you can’t then you’re already fighting an uphill battle and will have to work extra hard to keep your customers onside.
Allocating more resources isn’t always the most efficient solution (or possible) so having a plan to ensure your customers are still delighted, using the resources you have, can still lead you to a great outcome.
As you said, if a customer has to wait you should tell them straight away, and how long — so they can set their expectations. If he solution they get is exactly what they want then the wait won’t seem so important. If it’s not, then it will become a big part of their recollection. This is where you might include an offer or guarantee as part of your service delivery. If you don’t get an answer in X or you’re not satisfied, we’ll give you BLAH. This will help balance any feelings of frustration because you are actively demonstrating your commitment to achieving their outcome.
But time isn’t critical to every customer. Nor budget. I’ve had customers wait months for my services which means I have to understand what their primary concern is and make sure that’s what I’m also focused on. This kind of virtual queue is much like Meagan’s scenario, which is an opportunity to engage them in other areas of your service delivery while they wait.
Wow that was a long one. Let me know what you think.
You’re right Belinda, everything is correct. However some times lowering earnings a bit and allocating more resources can with time give much better results through a great customer service. A satisfied customer is always the best possible promotion. At least in the real world, it might be different on the net though.
Thanks for your answer.
You make an excellent point hypnodude – about potentially reducing profits to ensure your service delivery is all it needs to be. A satisfied customers *are* the best promotion and word of mouth marketing be a poooowerful beast.
Hi Belinda,
I have never put much thought into queue theory before but I guess it makes a lot of sense. But wait….does this mean there is some clever reason behind so many telephone queues using that annoying version of Greensleeves? lol
Thanks – Jay
Haha! Greensleeves, no but “your call will be answered in 3 minutes”, yes.
Hmmm unless they need to you to be a little bit INSANE by the time they answer in which case Greensleeves, yes!
This is a great article Belinda. As I get older (and I’m probably showing my age) I have become a stickler for customer service and this article reminds me of my most recent experiences receiving terrible customer service. I’ve had some pretty interesting real-life examples of customer service gone wrong over the last couple of months, most notably by telecommunication companies. Perhaps that won’t come as any surprise to anyone but in both cases, they should have been unavoidable.
Just this week, I had lunch in a cafe and let’s just say this particular business owner clearly does not understand the concept of lifetime customer – and it was all over 50 cents. If I was the cafe owner I would have written off the 50 cents but in my mind this particular business owner is far more short-sighted that I am. It’s his loss because I now have a perception in my mind of how this business owner conducts and operates his business. It’s such a shame because it didn’t need to be this way.
Anyway this article is a great reminder for anyone working online or offline that service delivery is so important to ensure your customers/readers/followers etc receive te best possible customer service experience you can give them.
Thanks for sharing your experience Shae. It sounds painful!
Customer service has always been important but thanks to social media we can share poor customer service with more people than ever before. Some businesses still don’t have their head around that and they suffer for it. Online or offline, good service delivery is our basic expectation!
Great work Belinda! A few really good points, I sent it off to a client who I think will get some good tips from it.
Thanks for sharing it Chris. I hope they can pick out some nuggets to improve their service delivery.
Great post! I can see this applying to my emails. It can take a week or two to get back to people sometimes, I need an auto responder that lets them know that I am not ignoring them personally, I just have too many emails!
Thanks Serena. I’m glad you were able to pick out some useful points for your business.
I think an auto responder is a great idea! I’ve been on the receiving end of one telling me that the person I was trying to contact only checked their emails at 10am and 4pm. It made me realise that my timeline wasn’t necessarily everyone’s and made me much more patient.
Thanks for leaving a comment. Feel free to share this with your coaching network!
I don’t know if the auto responder is a good idea. I came across with one in the past and it looked a bit silly. It was a live chat auto responder, so you can imagine, how useful it was.
But for the automatic email responding is a good idea.
Yeah those live chat auto responders can be as annoying as hell!
When it comes to email responders, I love to put a bit of personality into it so the reader (who has taken the time to email me) doesn’t feel put off by the fact my computer is talking to them. I appreciate it when other people do the same, which links nicely to Cassie’s post!
Great article Belinda. I agree making people happy (whether business, marketing or relationships!) is all about setting expectations. If you can set the right expectation, and communicate effectively, you’re probably in the top 2% of customer service.
Tanya and I had a comment thread going yesterday about how to keep track of contacts. I think services like Hootsuite and Aweber help. The key is probably to automate as much as possible, but of course, we then have our “A” list contacts/clients and prospects that deserve more personalised attention.
My challenge is how to keep track of them. It’s when people fall through the cracks they end up waiting too long for a reply and then they justifiably feel your customer service and attention is bad.
At the moment I’m with Jason Fonceca in that I use Excel to track as much as possible. I’ve tried Zoho and Outlook but both seem too wieldy as CRM systems. I think Icontact is probably one of the best ways to manage your prospects but at $200pcm + it’s expensive and you’d need sufficient online income to warrant an investment of this magnitude.
Good luck in the competition!
Hey Cassie – thanks for sharing your thoughts!
I use CapsuleCRM to manage my contacts and I love it. It’s social media friendly, affordable (I think it’s even free up to 500 contacts), has a task manager and integrates with Google Apps. But I still need a structured service delivery process that guides me through the various stages and reminds me to do things like explain my creative process, notify clients of milestones and follow up with progress notifications.
As great as business support tools are, they are only as strong as your service delivery process (IMHO
.
Service delivery process priority duly noted, and couldn’t agree more!
Thanks for the CRM suggestion – I love anything that syncs with Google apps and social media so will check it out. It might be just what’s needed, and great to have it recommended by you.
Jeez I hope I didn’t sound like a school marm in my last comment. “Now remember everyone, you must have a process!”
I’d love to get your impression of Capsule once you have a look!
Tell it like it is girl!!
Thanks for the shout-out Cassie
I also liked your IContact suggestion, I’ve not tried it, but it sounds interesting
Maybe I’ll design a Ryze Contacts system at the right time, with the right collaborators
Hey Jason, Belinda recommended CapsuleCRM which is free so I’m going to check that out. It syncs with Google Apps so is probably the one for me (without so much as a first date! LOL!).
Maybe the whole community will pick it up
I just checked all the pricing and features (for CapsuleCRM) and the fancy integration comes with the Professional edition which is $12 p/month. But the free version has quite a bit of space and all the other functionality (like cases, opps, tasks, and the email dropbox).
PS I don’t earn a commission from these guys!
Thanks for this Belinda.
To me it’s pretty much always good to promote things you believe in with good intentions.
If you somehow manage to acquire income by doing so, more power to you.
Some people start judging as soon as *money* is ever involved.
Well, I prefer people to get paid for doing (and promoting) what they love. Keep doing your thing Belinda. You rock.
I’ll have to check CapsuleCRM out too, thanks Belinda for the recommendation! Even if doesn’t come with a commission for you. Ha.
Love this article. It does sound obvious and yet so many sites/shops/companies don’t do it!
Even as a writer I have to manage expectations:
- Scoping the project carefully so that I never have to up my quote
- Breaking the project into chunks so that the client never has to wait too long
- Giving the client clear instructions of what to do while they are waiting (gathering assets, reviewing content etc).
- Always slightly under promising on timings to that I can hopefully over deliver.
Great post Belinda, I agree with Jason, you rock!
I’m feeling the love guys!
Thanks for sharing your key points Kate. I think as freelancers we have to pay special attention to managing our client expectations. We don’t have a shop or fancy office (well I don’t anyway) and our credibility is built on our reputation. That reputation is created by the clients we leave behind us.
I wonder if online businesses do this better — because we rely so heavily on other ways to build a strong relationship with our clients.
Do bricks and mortar make businesses lazy? I’d love your thoughts….
That’s an interesting thought, Belinda! I really do think that online businesses and entrepreneurs have more of a mind for this because you’re right in that we rely so heavily on reputation, and new methods, to do a lot of the work for us. Not all bricks and mortar businesses are lazy of course, but I’m sure they have more of a tendency to lean in that direction. Especially in the area of new technologies that might not necessarily be their expertise, but could benefit their business – and their customers.
I agree Tanya. I would hate to make a blanket generalisation but I think there is a certain image/status/message that comes with a bricks and mortar business. Even if it’s a simple office. It lends itself to saying “I’ve done well enough to have this space so you can trust me” but it also says “Now you’re in my world you have to follow my process….”
I imagine it becomes harder to remain flexible to your market’s needs. I expect the ideas behind queuing theory would become even more important – as the service delivery process comes with more risk [higher overheads etc]. Hmmm *brain spinning off in new directions*
Belinda, you went way beyond, “Have good customer service” in this in-depth piece. You covered just enough queuing theory to be helpful without being boring.
I love it when a website gives me different ways to get help–phone, email, chat. And when I have to engage in back-and-forth email, I most like the firms that let me stick with one person. I’m really impressed with companies that follow up to make sure everything worked out; AWeber did that for me recently, and I was genuinely pleased.
We are all in the business of service, whether it’s hard goods, digital goods, or processes that we are selling.
Good luck in the contest!
Thanks for sharing your thoughts Joel!
You allude to a important side effect of setting your customer expectations and that’s the feeling of safety. Fear and uncertainty are extremely powerful emotions that can quick destabilize your service delivery. On the other hand when your customers understand your process, know how long they might have wait or deal with the same person, they have a greater sense of surety and safety in your (seemingly more) capable hands. That’s definitely worth the effort. definitely appreciate it.
Hey Lacey, sorry about that – this one got stuck in spam, too, but I’ve rescued it, and I’ll watch closely to make sure your comments don’t get lost in the future.
As for first-time blogging advice, have you download my book, Engagement from Scratch!? (for free?)
I will second this. Danny’s book, Engagement From Scratch is a WEALTH of information and can SKYROCKET almost any blog endeavour.
I highly recommend the chapter on Business Models — it changed my life
And I will third that! I’m finding Engagement From Scratch SO valuable. I got so excited, I had to stop right in the middle and write down all these new ideas flooding into my head…and only just now realized I still have more to read! It’s awesome, well worth the read.
I am not surprised about this Danny Iny EFS love-fest. It is simply pure quality, accessible to anyone with a PC.
Great article Belinda, with some terrific insights. I would just say that there is another lens that can be brought to bare on this subject that might help to tie it all together. That is Queuing as a barometer of how well your organisation delivers your marketing plan.
Let’s be clear, by marketing plan I mean everything that it takes put your product or service into the hands of your target consumer. Your whole organisation from operations and finance to marketing and administration should be aligned to the promises you make in the brands you deliver through the products you put in the market. Activities that involve queuing are where the rubber hits the road where brand promise is turned into operational capability.
Consider, you sell tools. they’re great tools but they have a failure rate like everything else, yet you’ve done some amazeballs market research and found that this is the single biggest factor in decisions to buy by your target market. Accordingly you make the brand promise that no one will have more than 1 hour of down time through tool failure if they use your tools. That same market research has allowed you to put your return centres within 1 hour of the average + 2.5 st deviations from your target market. Sadly, last week you shipped a bad batch of tools to one location that sold like hot cakes but were defective leading to many returns at the same centre at the same time. So when you applied your erlang formulas to staffing the customer service centre did you take into account what promises had to be kept and how they were likely to be broken given your organisation’s structure and capability?
Queuing is an opportunity to turn belief in the brand promises into the truth of the delivery of those promises.
Again – love the article, well though out piece.
Thanks for leaving such a well thought out response Simon.
I love your line explaining that “Activities that involve queuing are where the rubber hits the road where brand promise is turned into operational capability.”
You are so right! Your business is absolutely judged on your performance at the client end of your marketing process, and those judgements impact your entire brand.
Great example too. It goes to show how much science there is behind process mechanism [in whatever form they take] and how you can use those numbers to work out things like the viability of your brand promises.
Thanks for commenting!
Something to think about! Thx!
Great article. Sometimes it’s the simple things that are often overlooked!
My personal opinion about queues is that as long as I can see some sort of progression, I can be understanding and tolerant of a long queue. It is very dependent on the service/product i’m queuing for though. Medicare for example; I don’t really want to be there, but I want some money back, so i’ll wait, staring patiently at the ticket number up on the screen and constantly rechecking my ticket. It’s not really a nice atmosphere either…..government department, sick people, noisy kids with runny noses…get me out of here!!!!
On the other hand, waiting for my morning coffee when the coffee shop is busy, is very different. I REALLY want my coffee, and most mornings I’d probably crawl over broken glass to get to that fresh espresso goodness!! You can also see that the shop is full of people, and you can see the barista busting out coffee after coffee like a well oiled machine, so you know that you’ll be served soon, and that your coffee isn’t too far away after that.
One thing I really like about where I get my coffee, is that they have an SMS ordering system. I can send my order over while I’m still at my desk at work, and then by the time I walk over the road, my coffee is waiting for me (or at least I’ve managed to jump the big queue of people lining up to place an order, which in itself is almost as satisfying as the coffee!)!
McDonalds is a good example of customer expectation and satisfaction when it comes to queues and waiting. Back in the day, there was rarely a wait on anything, as they had burgers lined up under the heat lamps ready to roll. But now everything is ‘made to order’ (at least everything is ‘assembled to order’ anyway) and there is a wait associated with it. People managed to adjust to the wait, because they were getting a better quality product (or at least the illusion of one) by waiting for it to be made (assembled).
Very busy McDonald ‘restaurants’ (such as Milton, near Suncorp Statium) have employed an ‘order while you queue’ system, where employees will approach you while you’re queuing to be served at the counter and take your order with a mobile device and give you a ticket number. Then all you need to do is get to the counter and pay for your order. Usually by this time your order is nearly ready. They’ve made queuing an efficient process!
Another example I find excellent (and it’s kind of still a queue), is after i’ve made a purchase online, you get the standard email of “thanks for your order”, but it’s really good when the online store has a logistics system that keeps you in the loop every step of the way: “your payment has been processed”, “your order is being picked”, “your order has been dispatched, here’s your tracking number”. There’s nothing worse than placing an order and sitting around for 2 weeks wondering if it’s on it’s way or if there’s been some sort of delay.
Simple things make the experience more satisfying and will ensure return business!
Thanks for sharing your thoughts Ben, and your examples. They are queuing theory in action! You make a great point about how much patient you are willing to be weighing up with the value you see in the end goal. You really love your coffee!
The government agency are undoubtedly aware that their system chokes up and isn’t enormously pleasant to be in, which is why the ticketing system is crucial for them, so you can measure your progress (and be more patient).
The coffee SMS ordering is very smart. You’re effectively queuing at your desk but you certainly don’t feel like it. This also has the benefit of showing the people waiting in the traditional queue that they can access a short cut next time, which kind of says “Hey, do you wanna be in this VIP club over here? You can!” There are loads of awesome subconscious messages being sent out.
And finally, the tracking mechanisms is pure genius. I can actually watch my packages travel the world! Customer service reps are never bothered with the tedious questions of “where’s my package? When will it be delivered?” and you know what? It’s kind of exciting to watch the progression. Maybe that’s just me?
Thanks again for sharing these examples. As you highlighted, they completely transform your experience as a customer so for any business, it’s worth pondering ways you can work on making that queue time more productive and/or enjoyable.
A very well put together posting, the content had me reading about being distracted during waiting times which is in itself a boring subject, however, I had completed the article before I was aware how much I read.
It was as if the writer really was following Little’s Law in copy write terms.
hehe the secret work of subheadings! Thanks for leaving such positive feedback Clare.
A great post Belinda but it had me thinking when was the last time I actually had to queue. It was probably a mere 5mins in the PO prior to Christmas so not really even enough to get me agitated. So much of what I require is organised online these days and hubby does the grocery shop, so no queues in the supermarket for me!
Ah you are lucky to have a queue-less life!
I know you own and run an extremely successful (and therefore busy) virtual assistant agency. I’d love to know how you handle your own service queues? Do clients ever have to wait for your services or does that go against your whole business value proposition?
don’tcha just hate queues! Almost as much as my hate for banks. Although the wait at my bank is nolonger the mind numbingly brutal chore it once was. My bank now has comfortable seating, a tv on and the time seams to pass quickly. You have time to stop, rest your feet and enjoy the air conditioning, whilst checking out whats happening on facebook! Great post Belinda.
Thanks for leaving a comment Louisa with such a lovely example of queuing theory in action! You are right – who likes waiting? Smart banks are totally onto this and you touched on a really important way they changed your perception — you aren’t queueing, you’re enjoying a rest stop.
And this can be applied to other industries. Not just ones with nice aircon
Making the waiting time productive (in addition to keeping customers informed at every turn) can really help make this shift in perspective.
Thanks again!
Belinda – I like the part about delighting the customer before you’ve delivered anything. I think that’s an important point that a lot of people forget. Thanks for the great post!
Thanks Tom! I firmly believe that your customer service experience begins well before you even talk to a customer, which is why good marketing is so important to your bottom line. From the very first contact point you have to help set the right expectations so everything that follows builds on that great first impression.
Good luck in the comp!
Great article Belinda. I can use this information on my websites and, since I just got back from a homeowner’s Board-related meeting, I thought about the different customers we have here in our community and how we can institute your tips in relating to them as well. Great job. I’m sharing with my tribe(s)!
Thanks Carol. I am glad it was so timely for you. And thank you for sharing it with your tribes!
Customer service can also be measurably improved as customer service reps are trained and trusted to deal with customer concerns at all levels. In other words, when a customer makes contact with the rep, is the rep appropriately equipped to define, address, and solve the customer’s problem, or will they be limited in what there are “allowed” to say or do (at their level in the chain)? How often are we told (during our own customer service encounters), “I will have to send this up the chain to perhaps eventually remedy the situation?” Let us, as CEO’s, empower our support personnel for the sake of prompt and efficient customer satisfaction. “Good” and “fine” are not good enough; we must strive for “magical” and “delightful” customer service encounters and experiences. This approach will notably increase brand equity.
Great point Tony. Would just add that empowering your staff in this way leads to greater employee satisfaction, retention and productivity, effectively seeding a virtuous cycle that accelerates the gains in brand equity.

This Clive and Co. collection takes inspiration from the fall runways where Jewel tones were very prevalent and mixed with versatility in all fabrics. Their hair cuts, although strong, shadow the mixed shapes of the fall clothing.
Havilah (green): In this case the hair is pushed to its longest point to create a technically cut faux hawk using the hairs natural growth pattern. The hair was pre-lightened following the shorter-to-longer feeling so that the color is more intense at the longer points. The pre-lightened hair was then colored emerald green following the influence of the fall runway jewel tones.
Ivy (red): This asymmetric style was created for a mix of strength, softness and versatility. The sides where undercut using scissor over comb to add the strong architectural shape while the top lends the softer, more textured feel. This style can also be pushed backwards for the pompadour effect. The color was applied at the roots to add dimension, lift and to give a ‘lit from above’ effect.
Kaia (blue): This style was inspired by the pill box hat. Meant to be square and angular. The color complimented the cut by adding dimension and a glowing effect to the front hairline. Again, the strong blue tones followed what was seen on fall runways.

head, KY (Sports Network) - Morehead State men's basketball coach Sean
Woods has been suspended one game after shoving point guard Devon Atkinson
during Wednesday's loss to Kentucky.
Woods, who was hired in May to replace Donnie Tyndall, shoved Atkinson in the
back as he walked to the bench during a timeout and continued to shout at the
senior during the stoppage.
"My behavior during Wednesday night's game was inappropriate and unacceptable.
I am truly sorry," Woods said. ."
The school launched an investigation on Thursday to further examine the
incident, before releasing a statement on Friday with the decision to suspend
Woods for Monday's contest with Norfolk State.
"We believe Coach Woods, while remorseful, is not above reproach. Therefore,
he will be suspended for Monday nights game against Norfolk State. This will
allow Coach Woods to consider his action and behavior, and allow him time to
contemplate the appropriate way to conduct himself with his players and on the
sideline," Morehead State director of athletics Brian Hutchinson said.
Woods led Mississippi Valley State to last year's NCAA Tournament before
taking over as the Eagles' coach.

So we know the true Siamese Algae Eater is the Crossocheilus siamensis which is often confused with the Flying Fox (Epalzeorhynchus kallopterus) and not so similar Chinese algae Eater (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri) as well as a fish known as the False Siamese Algae Eater (Garra cambodgiensis) which prefers fish food to algae.
Garra cambodgiensis
Epalzeorhynchus kallopterus
Often they are found in the fish store in a tank labeled – Algae Eaters which then house an array of fish that all look like a true Siamese Algae Eater.
Lots of shops mislabel these fish so Siamese algae eaters can also often be found under Flying Fox as well as other names.
The names in shops:
Algae Eater, Thai flying fox, Siamese flying fox, colorful flying fox, Epalzeorhynchos sp, trunk barb, Chinese catfish as well as an array of wonderful other names.
The only real gem for planted tanks is the Crossocheilus siamensis as this is the one that WILL eat brush algae (red algae) unlike most other fish…. All others also rather eat fish food and will not touch any algae.……
Intrigued as to how so many people can be confused a little research was needed…
It seems a whole group of fish who look very similar and near identical all swim in the same habitat and these are all caught up and labeled as one of the above names and sold in the shops.
So even in one tank in the shop you can have a mix of near identical fish who are actually different fish – yes it is so confusing but it gets even worse…
Here it comes… what you think may be a genuine Crossocheilus siamensis may actually be :-
Crossocheilus oblongus
Crossocheilus Langei
Crossocheilus atrilimes
Crossocheilus citripinnis
WHAT?????
Yip these guys all swim around together in a habitat and believe me they all look like the real deal…but don’t act like the real deal when it comes to Algae.
Crossocheilus oblongus
Crossocheilus Langei
Crossocheilus atrilimes
Note that in images the coloration varies depending on stress as well as lighting etc. very very rarely is imported and nearly does not exist in our tanks.
So who is the imposter you thought was your true Siamese algae eater?
If you are lucky it is the Crossocheilus Langei which I believe we all label as and know as the true Siamensis – these guys are the only real brush algae eaters. All the others prefer fish food….
If you are unlucky you have the Crossocheilus atrilimes who favors soft plants and moss which makes sense to me now…. some people report their SAE eating moss etc. whilst other say they don’t touch theirs.
If you have a Siamese Algae Eater and are curious as to which one you really have now here is an excellent link:
After a head breaking hour I have discovered that I have 2 x Crossochelius Langei & 1 x Crossochellus Oblongus & 1 x Crossochellus citripinnis
Two of mine I believed to be Siamensis - the back one is a Citripinnis and the front on is a Langei (note the coloring is the same but the snout is different)

I like those fish! They are just awesome.
Nice blog BTW!!!
Regards,
Patrice from
Just recently purchased 6 of these for my 6ft tank..they are fantastic little fish it's like watching 6 little Hoovers cleaning everything in their path
Enjoy reading your blogs keep up the good work
Barry
Jess, how are you supposed to tell one from the other? Some of them look so similar!
Hi Ava,
If you want the true algae eating one (C. Langei) then look out for a dark blotch under the abdomen and litle barbles on the front then you can't go wrong.

I'd like to ask you a more specific question. Can you write to me at charismaqueen100@gmail.com? Thanks!

I love these perennial rituals that bring family and friends closer together. Whether we're in the same location, or miles apart, these traditions become part of the rhythm of our lives. It can be something as simple as sharing gifts of food, setting the table with your great-grandmother's tablecloth, hanging that special ornament or playing a favorite game after a holiday meal. Traditions pay homage to who we are, where we come from and what we cherish most in life.
As I was setting the table for Thanksgiving I thought about Leila Saks Ranger, my husband's great-grandmother. While I never had the pleasure of meeting her, I've had numerous conversations with my mother-in-law about her life, her passion and her artistic creativity. She had an eye for beauty and the talent to transform that vision into a magnificent handbag, a needlepoint sampler, or a lovely flower arrangement. Often these heirlooms will spark an interesting conversation around the dinner table, or just quietly comfort those who remember seeing them in another home at an earlier time.
Traditions are meant to be passed on to the next generation. This year Ally and her cousins, Chloe and Nicholas, prepared the desserts for our holiday meal. Chloe made a delicious apple pie using a recipe from the original Silver Palette cookbook, while Ally made a traditional pumpkin tart that she served with a caramel sauce. I helped with the crust as that takes a while to master, but we left them on their own to assemble and bake their creations.
Nicholas arrived with his masterpiece which tasted as good as it looked. With the dessert making in more than capable hands, my sister and I went out to dinner on Wednesday evening and decided this might just become our new tradition. It was a welcome respite before a full day in the kitchen.
As we make the seque into the Christmas season, it's time to hang one of my favorite decorations: Stolle's angel. Some wonder why I'm so enamored with this bubble wrap angel and all I can say is that a gift made by a child can really strike a chord. Stolle presented it to me when she was about six years old and I was so impressed with what she created from some very simple, albeit unusual, materials. Who looks at bubble wrap and thinks of an angel? Obviously, an insightful child. With all the hustle, bustle and commercialism of Christmas it's sometimes hard to stay focused on what's really important, so this angel is a loving and gentle reminder as we head into the holiday season.

"My hair is so frizzy, I'm starting to look like my Labradoodle!"
-- Lisa Greenberg, 44, Public Relations Consultant
Like most women with curly hair, Lisa had different textures all over, including soft waves, medium-size curls, and tight ringlets. The top section near her crown was frizzier than the smoother bottom and underneath layers -- and using one product (even sophisticated curl definers and frizz fighters, which she tried) couldn't tame it all.
What do you think of this story? Leave a Comment.
Girls just use a product called pro naturals after a shower. Its argan oil and it takes care of frizz like the gods, haha. Its really good, 100% recommend it.11/11/2012 04:37:01 PM Report Abuse

No!No! Face Trainer: Cool or Not?
My friends over at That's Fit recently tried out the new Face Trainer by No!No! While the name of the company is silly, No!No! has been making beauty products for a while now — Bella reviewed its hair removal gadget.
The Face Trainer ($199) is a mask that provides resistance while you perform a 10-minute facial exercise series. Toning the muscles of your face with the mask is said to decrease sagging and wrinkles as well as improve skin tone and color. The tester at That's Fit could feel her muscles getting a workout — the mask and exercise series left her face tired, similar to the sensation when you hold a smile too long for photos. The device is approved by the FDA. While I like to think of exercise as a panacea to any ill, I am not sure working the muscles in my face will reduce the appearance of my crows feet. What do you think?

Mystery Babylon is not the U.S. The U.S. is not guilty of the blood of the martyrs and saints of Jesus Christ and she certainly is not decked in purple and scarlet. She does not hold a gold cup in her hand. Check out the most recent photos of the pope holding a mass with his dazzling solid gold chalice full of abominations! --- Or a convention of "cardinals" running around in their long black robes with scarlet or purple sashes and little caps.

Kris Dim on shrugging strategies
After suffering a heart attack and life-threatening complications in 2007, Kris Dim made a successful comeback last year. The 2003 NPC Nationals light-heavy winner was third in his first contest back, the 2009 Europa Supershow 202, and then placed an eye-opening fourth in his hometown Sacramento Pro, an open contest, missing his third Olympia qualification by one slot. Dim gives us some pointers on trapezius training and serves up a typical traps routine.
DIM’S TRAP TIPS
- Trains traps once per week.
- Box shrugs are performed with a free-weight box-bar that allows me to hold my arms at my sides with palms facing inward. Dumbbell shrugs can be substituted for these.
- Machine shrugs are done on a Nautilus machine. Barbell shrugs can be substituted for these.
- Shrugs are a short movement so be certain to focus on contractions. I like to hold the contractions early in a set and then go faster as the set wears on and I tire.

Laboratory for Pathology and Bacteriology. For this purpose, pathogenicity and virulence of infectious agents are characterized by histological, histochemical, immunohistological, and molecular pathological techniques.
The emphasis is laid on investigations of the cell and tissue tropism of viral pathogens, the interaction between virus and host including molecular pathogenesis. For this purpose, various diagnostic test methods have been established for the detection of antigens or nucleic acids in tissue sections by immunofluorescence or in situ hybridization and are continuously improved.
Bacteriological investigations are conducted to confirm the freedom of cell cultures and other biological test materials e.g. from mycoplasmas. Furthermore, bacteriological diagnostics are used to support pathomorphological findings.
Main research topics and projects
- Pathogenetic investigations on the role of viral proteins for the neurovirulence of pseudorabies virus (PrV) in the mouse model and in vitro
- Comparative immunohistological investigations on the pathogenesis of classical and African swine fever in domestic pigs and wild boar
- Histopathological and molecular investigations on the pathogenesis of equine sarcoids and other papillomavirus infections of domestic animals
- Comparative pathogenetic studies on the viral neurotropism using PrV, lyssaviruses and teschoviruses as examples
- Immunohistological investigations on the tropism of avian and porcine influenza viruses
- Detection of mycoplasmas in cell cultures
- Pathogenesis of viral and bacterial mixed infections

South Korea's Government has ordered the country's airlines to bypass North Korean airspace on international flights after the reclusive leadership in Pyongyang said it could not guarantee the safety of civilian aircraft.
North Korea is upset over US-South Korean military exercises planned over 9-20 March. It said through the state-run Korea Central News Agency last night that "security cannot be guaranteed for South Korean civil airplanes flying through the territorial air of our side and its vicinity...while the military exercises are underway".
Aircraft have been flying through North Korean airspace since the late 1990s following a groundbreaking agreement reached by IATA and ICAO under which the Pyongyang Government collects overflight fees.
South Korea's Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime says in a statement on its website this morning that as a result of the North's comments Asiana Airlines and Korean Air will be required to bypass North Korean airspace and take longer routings through Japan's Flight Information Region.
It says an estimated 16 flights will be affected per day, 12 to the Americas and four to Russia. It adds that the longer routings will add between 15min and 40min and between 3 million won ($1,900) and 4 million won in additional costs per flight.

Lyrics
"Up to par, Katie bars the kitchen
signs but not me in"
There's an old saying "Katie
bar the door". It's used a lot in the south meaning, "something
unstoppable [is coming]". [gerbil] * 'Katie bar the kitchen door' is a southern term
that meant you better watch out. [Stipe,
on AOL] * It's been suggested that
this song might be related to Stipe's sister's experience teaching
deaf children. (Consider also "I'm the sign and you're not
deaf.") Therefore, the "sign" in question might
be American Sign Language. [Chris
Piuma] * "Up to par" means
"good enough". [Chris
Piuma]
"talk until you're blue"
That is, talk until you're blue in the face from lack of
oxygen, because you talked so much you forgot to breathe. [Chris Piuma]

Good for the price but definately not luxurious
The apartment is on a street of apartment buildings so on arrival the street is not appealing, but the location is good as it is less than 10 minutes walk to Potsdamer Platz or the Branderburg Gate. The bed is comfortable with new linens and the kitchen is well equipped. The finish is not to a high standard - the wooden floor looks new but there are gaps between the floor and the wall and several "bumps" . The ledge under the windows is unpainted. The bathroom has not been renovated and so has a shower over the bath with a shower curtain. With no washing machine or heated towel rail, having fresh towels is a problem if you stay more than a few days. Internet is available if you have a laptop, but there is no Wifi.
Overall we were disappointed with this apartment. From the photos and the title we had expected something of a higher standard. We left a day early and when we asked for a refund for the unused night we were refused.

Fabulous, affordable and central
Joerg and Ralf were really helpful and welcoming. The apartment was very clean and easy to live in. It was comfortable and close to everything touristy in Berlin. It was one of the best vacation experiences we've ever had as a couple.
The apartment was almost 100 percent wheelchair accessible also. The door to the kitchen was a little narrow but my wheelchair did fit through and there was a slight lip on the bathroom door which would not pose a significant inconvenience to most disabled people.

Excellent location
The location of this apartment and its proximity to the most visited sights, public transportation, and shopping can't be over emphasized. The apartment is 2 blocks from the metro, 3 blocks from Potsdamer Platz, about the same from the Brandenburg Gate and an easy walk to Checkpoint Charlie. I choose this apartment for location and I was not disappointed.
The apartment itself is one large room that accommodates one double and one twin bed plus a divan and a small chair. The beds were acceptable. The end wall is fully windowed, which provided lovely light. There is a small kitchen with a dorm sized fridge, no microwave, but an oven/cooktop, kettle and toaster. The bathroom was clean and had an unusual shower/sink connection that it took all three of us to figure out how to operate as the shower was turned off and we didn’t know there was a switch on the fixture. Directions would have been helpful.
A TV is provided, but since no channels were in English, it was of no value to my group. However, we were too exhausted after long days of sightseeing to care much if we had a TV to watch. There is a Hit grocery one block away that was very convenient for breakfast food.
This apartment would not meet my definition of luxury, but I would certainly recommend it based on location, value and the very easy rental arrangements and friendly reception we received.

Perfect apartment - perfect location.
I stayed here for 5 nights in October 2010.
The apartment was very clean and well equipped. The things I look for while travelling are clean premises, a safe neighbourhood, plenty of hot water, good bed and a strong Wifi signal. This apartment had all of these.
It was just meters from the Jewish Holocaust Memorial and the site of Hitler's bunker and just inside the walls of the former East Berlin. 10 minutes from Brandenburg Gate and just a block away from a major subway line. You can see the Bundestag from the window.

Great accommodation, good location and value for money. Joerg very helpful and Marko thankyou for your service in unblocking the shower after I phoned. Myself, my husband and our two sons who were running the marathon all stayed together in this apartment. The big bonus was that Joerg was happy for us to keep our luggage there while the boys ran the marathon so we were able to go back freshen up etc before setting off to catch our flights home. Thankyou.

Thanks for just an excellent apartment!
We stayed at Joergs lovely apartment for four days and it was a great experience.
We looked for a calm place to stay with our little son. The apartment is spacious, clean, have good fittings, nice furniture and comfortable beds.
The apartment is perfectly located close to Friedrichstraße. There is a shopping center around the corner with all of the essentials.
We really enjoyed our stay in Berlin!

A great place to stay!
A great place to stay especially for first timers. Apartment was spacious and clean. Marko the greeter was very informative and gave us some great and valuable hints. Location fab, just 1 block from the metro station, so ideal for arrival and departure. Just around the corner was a bakery, a lovely chinese restaurant and plenty of shops just a five minute walk. Everything you need on hand to make for a comfortable stay, central location, but away enough from the hustle and bustle to get a good nights sleep!
We will definitely go back again!

Profile
ABC Domes
After hurricanes crisscrossed Florida in 2004 and 2005, Peter Fedele, who has spent his career in the construction business, researched which types of buildings fared best during storms. The answer kept coming up domes, which led to ABC Domes, a disaster recovery company based in Lakeland. The company rents out space in domes to financial institutions and document-storage companies. Customers include Bank of America, BB&T and Certified Records Management. The Lakeland site — the company has a dome in Texas, too — employs 35 and has four domes, with plans for another next year. CEO Fedele says the domes can withstand winds of up to 300 mph. “They’re basically disaster-proof,” he says.

Back in my youthful exuberance days, I and another guy (whose name and face both now elude my memory) used to compete to see how short we could land a Cessna 150. The answer was, pretty short. We would come in hanging on the edge of a stall and stomp on the brakes the moment a wheel touched the runway. I felt as if we got stopped in a couple of hundred feet, though I never actually measured.
The 150 was a very forgiving airplane (and I suppose its successor, the 152, was too, but by the time the 152 came out training planes were behind me) and so you could fly these minimum-speed approaches, the airspeed indicator needle wobbling around in the position error zone, without much anxiety about something going wrong. Great things can be achieved in airplanes that make you feel confident. And great mistakes can be made, too.
Here is what may be a case in point. I say "may be" because it's always difficult to say with certainty what was going on in the cockpit before a fatal accident occurs, when there is no cockpit voice recorder to help us out; we have to rely on external evidence. In this case, the external evidence consists of some seemingly rough and erratic low-level flying. The airplane was airborne for less than a minute before it stalled and crashed.
The accident involved a student pilot and an instructor; it took place almost three years ago at Levelland, Texas, on a hot and blustery May evening. Although it was nearing 7 o'clock when the 150 took off, the temperature was still 91 degrees. A stiff wind, 28 knots gusting to 37 as measured by a meteorological reporting station at nearby Texas Tech University, was blowing from 140 degrees. The takeoff runway was 17; the crosswind component was therefore around half of the wind speed.
The National Transportation Safety Board's report on the accident cites the accounts of two eyewitnesses. The first was himself an instructor in the same flight school as the accident pilot. He had realized, after the 150 taxied out, that he had left his wallet and keys in the airplane on its previous flight. He drove out to an intersecting taxiway to try to flag the airplane down, but failed. He reported that the takeoff, which he observed from close at hand, was "abrupt and nose high." The airplane then leveled off, climbed to 50-100 feet, and made a steeply banked left turn. It sank on the downwind leg, settling to 50 feet again before climbing to 100-200 feet. At that point the instructor drove back to the flight school; he did not see the accident that occurred moments after he turned away.
A second witness was standing outside his shop on the airport. He paid attention to the little Cessna's takeoff, he said, because the wind was so strong. He saw the car beside the runway and the arm waving out the window and heard the airplane's engine go to full power. Like the other witness, he reported that the 150 was "sharply pulled into flight," flew level briefly to gain speed, and then climbed to, in his opinion, 300 feet. It then "banked hard left" -- 70 degrees, he thought -- and, after turning 180 degrees, "dove sharply" to a height of 30 feet. It then "sharply climbed" back to 300 feet before it "sharply turned left again at a 70-80-degree bank." It appeared to rock once, and then dove almost vertically to the ground near the approach end of Runway 17.
Note the witness's repeated use of the word "sharply." The airplane was being tossed around roughly -- whether by the pilot or by the wind, we don't know, though the impression, from the extreme bank angles, is that the pilot was more in charge than the wind was. In any case, the numbers -- 30 feet, 70 degrees, and so on -- should not be taken literally; witnesses' estimates are seldom accurate, especially when a fatal outcome has retrospectively heightened the significance of the event.
One can make some guesses about the reasons for the airplane's observed behavior. If it seemed to be pulled sharply into the air, the reason was probably that the wind -- the crosswind component, remember, was 14-19 knots -- was starting to push it sideways, and the pilot wanted to get it off the ground. Once airborne, it picked up sufficient speed to begin to climb. At some altitude -- the witnesses' reports differ, but let us assume that the one who was a flight instructor might have been the more accurate and that the altitude was none too high -- the airplane was racked around in a steeply banked, apparently continuous 180-degree turn onto the downwind leg.
Why such a drastic turn? One reason could have been instructional: to show the student that a coordinated downwind turn, even a very abrupt one, does not result in an immediate stall or even a rapid loss of airspeed. And indeed it did not. The airplane did lose some airspeed, however -- any airplane loses speed in a steeply banked turn, even in still air, and the tailwind may also have picked up a bit -- and it settled somewhat before resuming its climb as it flew along the downwind leg.
The C-150, with its 100 hp engine, is not a powerful airplane even on a standard day at sea level. On this particular evening the density altitude was almost 6,500 feet, and the engine could not have put out more than about 82 horsepower. With so little excess power, it would be slow to recover airspeed or altitude lost to a gust or a downdraft. As it climbed, it presumably did not accelerate much.
The airplane now had two or three cards stacked against it. Its indicated airspeed was probably not very high. It had little excess power. Finally, it was flying in a gusty following wind.
The effect of the wind under these circumstances is complex. On the downwind leg, the 150 was flying with a gusty wind coming from about 30 degrees to the right of its tail. Suppose, for argument's sake, that its indicated airspeed was 15 knots above the stalling speed. A 10-knot gust would still leave it a speed margin; a 15-knot gust -- the reported gusts were not that strong -- would bring it to its level-flight stalling speed, but since its angle of attack would not immediately change it would be able to accelerate with some loss of altitude but not necessarily any loss of control. It is angle of attack, remember, not speed, that makes a wing stall.
When the 150 made a steeply banked left turn, however, its situation became more precarious. Because the bank angle is steep, the airplane is now showing its top, not its tail, to the wind. If the wind is steady, this makes no difference, provided that the pilot keeps the angle of attack below the stalling one. But if a lull -- a negative gust -- occurs during the turn, its effect is not only to momentarily increase the indicated airspeed but also to increase the angle of attack. To the steeply banked airplane with its dorsal aspect to the wind, a sudden drop in wind speed is equivalent to an upward gust. If the wing is already close to its stalling angle of attack, it may stall despite the increase in indicated airspeed.
Is this what happened? Who knows? It's actually unnecessary to invoke exotic combinations of wind and attitude to explain a stall in the traffic pattern. People have stalled airplanes on calm days because they banked too steeply and pulled too hard, or because they got the controls crossed, which is much easier to do when the wind is blowing and the airplane appears to be sliding sideways over the ground.
What makes this accident especially puzzling is the exhibition of an uncommonly abrupt and extreme style of flying in weather conditions in which many people would hesitate even to go aloft in an airplane as light and anemic as a Cessna 150. The two don't seem to go together, especially when you consider that the instructor was 64, an age at which most pilots have outgrown the feeling that they have something to prove. Unfortunately, the NTSB's report includes no comment on whether displays of youthful ebullience while maneuvering in the traffic pattern were typical of this instructor. His colleague on the ground seems not to have considered the gyrations of the 150 sufficiently out of the ordinary for him to continue watching them.
We don't even know, finally, who was flying the airplane, but it would be a strange lesson plan that required abrupt and extreme maneuvering in the traffic pattern. A possible explanation of the 150 staying in the pattern without gaining much altitude is that the instructor caught sight of his colleague in the car beside the runway when the 150 was already in its takeoff roll; that he then saw the wallet and keys and realized that they needed to be returned; that he then said, "My airplane," and, taking the controls, racked the little trainer around with the confident bravado of one who knows the 150 well, and knows what a well-behaved and forgiving airplane it is..

Hi all,
Some of you have been helping me on my other thread but I thought I should start a new one with a more appropriate topic title. Here's my other thread in case you're interested.
We have booked rooms at The Springs in Arenal and at Tulemar in Manuel Antonio and now I'm' on to considering which tours to book and what to do about transportation.
I have seen that there are lots of threads on transportation, but I don't know if having kids (or travelling in a group of 4, perhaps) would affect someone's advice on whether to rent a car and/or whether to get a driver. For instance, maybe it's hard to get a taxi in La Fortuna that fits 4 people, or there may be other considerations that I'm not thinking about. Though I know others have done it and thought it worked well, I don't think we'll do public transportation.
Our itinerary:
Thurs - arrive 9:15 pm SJO - stay at airport hotel
Fri - drive to The Springs
Fri - Wed - Springs
Wed - travel to MA
Wed - Sun - Tulemar - depart Sunday at 11:45 am from SJO
I've seen the rental car vs. driver debate, and both ways have been recommended so I'm sure it's up to personal preference. I am not really afraid of driving, but my husband has unfortunately lost his license for a few months (don't ask) so I would be the sole driver. We'll have the drive to Arenal, the drive from Arenal to Manuel Antonio, and then return from MA to SJO on our last morning. All the long drives should be in daylight.
I see 3 options.
- Get 1 rental car for the whole time
- Get a driver for the 3 longer drives and rent while in La Fortuna and MA
- Get drivers for 3 longer drives and take taxis in La Fortuna and MA.
Does one make more sense than the others?
At Tulemar, I know they do not serve dinner on the property, but they say that there are many restaurants outside the gates. It seems like a very large property. Will we need a car/taxi to get to those restaurants?
Another option: would you drive (either in rental car or with driver) or fly from MA to SJO. I'm leaning towards the drive, so we don't have to worry as much about luggage weight and flight delays, but in some ways it can be easier to just fly.
Regarding tours, we will have 4 full days, not counting travel days at the Springs. The hotel sent us a list of their tours. I know we can book on our own, but just starting with their list, what I saw on TripAdvisor and what I read about in my Eyewitness Travel guide book, I've come up with the following.
- Arenal Hanging Bridges (half day)
- Sky Trek Zipline (half day)
- Cano Negro (full day) or Penas Blancas (1/2 day) - I've heard more raves about Cano Negro but I wonder if it's a long day for the kids?
- The hotel offers a 4 hour volcano hike. I don't know how much of that is transportation time. I think that would be interesting but I don't know if it would be too strenuous for the kids. Has anyone else done this with kids?
My husband expressed interest in a night hike. We should be able to fit that in since I plan to do the other tours first thing in the morning if possible.
What about the Sky Tram? Is that worth doing?
Mostly I'd like to spend our afternoons at the Springs in the pools or springs. We may do tubing and horseback riding in the afternoons too. And I think we'd like to visit the wildlife preserve at The Springs.
Is there something glaring that I'm missing or something I should cut out? Would it be better to leave a full day open in Arenal? My current plan would have us booked for a tour every morning, if we do a volcano hike.
We will have 3 full days in Manuel Antonio (Wed is travel day and we depart Sunday morning), and I plan to spend more time on the beach. According to the Tulemar website we can see quite a bit of wildlife right on the grounds. I remember reading that most of the things you can do near Arenal (ziplines, hanging bridges) you can also do in Manuel Antonio, but I'm sort of feeling like if our time in Arenal is so scheduled, maybe we'd like to wing it more in MA. Anything I MUST do near MA?
Thanks for your help!!

Arenal & MA with kids 8 & 10 - which tours and transportation question
Hi all,
16 Replies | Jump to last reply |
16 more wildlife at Cano Negro. It takes a couple of hours to get there for the boat to put in, so it's up to you if you think your kids would be up for that. It's awesome; we've done it a few times. There is no bathroom on the boat however. We liked Penas Blancas too, but the wildlife isn't as abundant. It's much closer however if that makes a difference. Cano Negro involves a big covered motor powered boat; Penas Blancas is a raft. I would definitely do the tubing at The Springs. We loved that; the river there is absolutely beautiful. We had two guides all to ourselves when we did it. There's a nice open air restaurant by the river where you can eat lunch if you want to. Most of the volcano tour would be hiking since the hotels are fairly close to the volcano. We saw some wildlife when we did it; the best part was going at night to view the volcano, but there's not current lava flow. The hike that we did wasn't strenuous. They give you a lot of history of the volcano and its eruptions. Personally I would rather hike at the waterfall than do the volcano hike. If you do Sky Trek ziplining, you'll automatically do the tram - that's how you go up to the top. Sky Trek is great with wonderful views of the lake and volcano. The lines are incredibly high and fast.
One more thing if you have time; your kids would probably really enjoy the Proyecto Asis animal rescue center. We were able to feed a sloth, monkeys, and macaws when we went. They have a peccary, raccoon, kinkajo, toucans, etc. New animals come in and others are rehabilitated and released, so the makeup is always changing.
There's an internal shuttle at Tulemar that can take you to the property entrance. From there, there are restaurants within short walking distance. You could also walk the whole way. It's uphill to the entrance. We saw capuchin and squirrel monkeys on the property daily and also three and two toed sloths. We never ventured into the park.
I am a confident driver not bothered by most driving including downtown city driving. I would not be comfortable driving in Costa Rica. Plus parking in Manuel Antonio can be a pain.
You do not need a car in Manuel Antonio. We were there for 6 nights without a car. Most of the excursions will pick you up at the door or the concierge will arrange a cab to pick you up at your door.
We were in 405 which is the second condo from the gate so we walked to most of the restaurants from Tulemar. Twice we took cabs to restaurants and had no problem. We took their business card so we could have the restaurant call for our return.
The zip line company, Canopy Safari, is great and wonderful with kids so you can wait until you get to MA for the zipline if you want.
Birdie, which restaurants were you able to walk to from Tulemar? We're looking at staying there for a future trip.
Hi, volcanogirl.
Kapi Kapi, which we really liked. Good food, lovely atmosphere.
Cafe Milagro, casual spot that's great for breakfast and lunch. We did not try dinner there but I did buy a few bags of coffee to bring home for gifts.
Aqua Azul, lively, crowded, very casual, good food. They don't take reservations but the concierge at Tulemar can make one for you.
The casual restaurant at Como Si No because I wanted to see the hotel. I wouldn't go back but enjoyed the huge lizard watching us eat.
We took cabs to:
Raphael's Terrazas which we all really enjoyed.
Ronnie's Place for drinks, sunset and good, not great, dinner.
La Luna at Gaia which was good but I think I prefer Kapi Kapi for a higher end meal.
We also had a private chef cook the fish the guys caught and ate several breakfasts and lunches at the Tulemar beach cafe.
There are any number of other restauarants you can walk to in addition to the little food market. Tulemar is right in the middle of town and seems to be the only high end property that is. At the same time, though, when you are on property you feel like you are out on a quiet peninsula.
Oh, thanks for all the info. We stayed at Mango Moon and were able to walk to Cafe Milagro, Cafe Agua Azul, Salsipuedes, and we took a taxi to Ronnie's Place. I guess Tulemar is sort of in the same area. It's appealing to me because it has its own beach.
cb, we use a private driver to go between cities and then use taxis once we're in town. Arenal is a lot more spread out than Manuel Antonio. We save flying for areas that are harder to get to like Tortuguero or the Osa.
We enjoyed Kapi Kapi (walking distance) too and had several good meals at La Luna (not walking distance). Both are a bit upscale. La Luna has a great view and they have a tapas menu in the bar section if you don't want a full meal.
Birdie, Thank you for your driving input. I was sort of leaning towards hiring drivers, so I can enjoy the view and not be white-knuckled, so I'm not sorry to hear your recommendation that I not drive.
Regarding the waterfall, volcanogirl, I read your report of rappeling and I think I'm too scared (and don't think it's a good idea with the kids!) to do that. I will look into a hike there instead. I think that's something we can do on our own without a guide, right?
The Proyecto Asis would be right up our alley. My youngest is obsessed with animals. Did you do the 1 1/2 hour tour, or the 3 1/2 hour tour & volunteering? I think they would really like the volunteering one and that must be the one people talk about on tripadvisor where they can hold and feed animals.
Is this anywhere near the waterfall? Could we do the 2 on the same day? I hear the hike up from the waterfall is strenuous, so I'd love to be able to do it in the morning, but my mornings are getting filled, if we do Sky Trek, Hanging Bridges, one of the boat tours and the Proyecto Asis.
Patty - thanks for the info on the shuttle at Tulemar. I booked it without doing much research because it was so highly recommended, but the downside is I don't really know basic details that I would have discovered had I done more research. That shuttle will come in handy and we are very happy to do some walking too.
Thanks all!!
c, the waterfall hike and the rappelling are two totally different things in two completely different areas. The waterfall hike is at La Fortuna Waterfall and involves taking steps down to the waterfall and you can swim in the crystal clear river if you want to. It's set with pavers; if you can walk down a bunch of steps you can do it. It took us about ten minutes to walk down. Coming back up is a little steep, and we saw people stopping to catch their breath on the way back up, but it's not difficult if you take a little break. The rappelling is done in a canyon and involves rappelling down multiple waterfalls, much more rigorous than just visiting La Fortuna Waterfall. You can do the waterfall hike on your own. There's a big parking lot and an organized entrance where you pay your entry fee; I think it was around ten bucks or so. The rappelling is done with guides.
We did Proyecto Asis as part of a cultural tour we did with Desafio. They made several stops during the day and Asis was one of them. We also went to an organic farm called Luna Nueva, and we made one other stop. We got a guided tour of the property. It's very small and has a small pond full of turtles and herons. Then there are animals around in big cages, and you can enter some of the cages like the sloth's and macaws'. You can feed the monkeys bananas through the cage. And we were able to hold some of the animals like the raccoon. It's not near the waterfall, but you could do both on the same day depending on how you timed it. They may only do feeding certain times of day though, so you'd have to check on that.
volcanogirl, Salsipuedes was the first restaurant you reached after turning right out of Tulemar's gate. Do you remember an orange 4-story hotel or apartment comlex right in the middle of town? It is next door to the Tulemar gate.
The beach at Tulemar is lovely. We were going to take a cab to another beach just for a different atmosphere but loved Tulemar's so much we decided that we didn't need to go anywhere else. There is shade if you want to stay out of the sun and plenty of chairs and umbrellas. Do check out all the pools, though. There was a quiet one that we went to for swimming and a more popular one we liked in the evening for drinks at the bar.
I don't know if you saw an earlier post from the woman that was knocked down by the wave at Tulemar. I'm bringing it up more for cboris's benefit than yours since she will have kids with her. I think the water at Tulemar is great but there is one characteristic that is good to keep in mind. It may be true at other beaches in Manuel Antonio, too. When the tide changes, the water changes very quickly. Waves that weren't there minutes ago suddenly develop and the undertow gets stronger. If you are on the beach it sounds like a boat has gone by and the waves from the wake are coming in. The waves aren't very big and the undertow isn't particularly strong, but the fact that it occurs so quickly, can surprise swimmers. There is a local magazine that has a tide chart in it. If it isn't already in your condo, you can get a copy at the concierge desk.
We did take a tour of the park, and as Patty pointed out, we saw more wildlife on property than we did in the park. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the park tour. We saw a lot of other creatures like bats and cool insects that our guide pointed out with his scope.
Thanks for all the details. I guess we stayed very close to the property and didn't know it. Where we stayed was fine, but the beach access was terrible, a big long steep muddy hike to get down.
Your family will love Tulemar! As others have noted, the park is worth a visit but we saw more wildlife on property and preferred the property beach. As for Arenal we stayed at Lost iguana and enjoyed the property (to bad the volcano is not active). Our family really liked the hanging bridges, sky trek zip lines, Eco thermals hot springs(stay for dinner) and the horseback ride to la Fortunate waterfall. Enjoy!
Having traveling with kids that age, I would skip Cano Negro. You already have a lot of driving to get from place to place, so to do a full day tour to see wildlife is just adding to the driving. You will see a lot of wildlife already, both in MA and at the Springs, so it's not necessary to me. The drive is long for the amount of time you're on the water. And yes you get to see a lot, it in the distance for the most part. The Damas Mangrove boat trip in Manual Antonio is somewhat similar and you don't have to drive hours to get to it.
As far as the transportation - I think a nice balance is to rent a car while you're in Arenal and hire a driver for the transportation between locations. We've done this and it worked well. For us it was nice to have the flexibility to have our own vehicle in Arenal to go to restaurants, drive to Sky Trek, even just drive around the lake. Just be on our own time. But then with the kids, to have a driver drive us on the long trips took away a lot of the potential stresses. It was also nice to have someone to narrate the ride for us. We've also done the drive on our own. But I find the drive from Arenal to MA to be long and prefer to have a driver. The one from San Jose to Arenal is much shorter. You could consider picking up the car at the airport and driving that leg on your own and turning in the car after Arenal. You definitely don't need a car in Manual Antonio - as others have said. We did walk to dinner each night. I don't remember taking a taxi anywhere, although maybe we did.
As Birdie mentions, do keep in mind that the undertow can be very strong. The waves don't have to be very big, but that water can be very deceiving. That being said, my daughter and I spent hours and hours on the boogie boards they had for us there. We had an absolute blast. We never ventured to the National Park. Never felt a need to - there was a lot of wildlife on the property and the beach was great.
I think one thing we found each time we've been to CR with our kids is that regardless of how much I thought I knew what we planned to do each day, between the unpredictable weather and just getting caught up in each day - we never really did what we intended to do. So have some ideas in mind, but especially with the kids, be flexible.
We loved the Springs, but we didn't enjoy the wildlife preserve there. It consists of cats in cages which to us was kind of sad, like a zoo. Otherwise the property is great. Kids may enjoy being able to get so close to big cats. It's not a very natural setting though.
We did the Damas mangrove tour in MA which only takes a few of hours. While the tour was enjoyable, we didn't like that our guide baited the monkeys. Next time this is something I'd inquire about before booking.

We are going to Kauai in January 2005. The cost of our already booked airline tickets has gone done ~$80 per person (five people). Do you know if United charges a fee to receive a voucher for the difference?
We booked through a travel agent (who is closed today) who appears to be under the impression that you cannot receive a voucher for the difference. BeachBoi mentioned in a previous post that this can be done and to check with my agent.
I am just trying to get more information as I cannot find any on United's website. Are there any United travelers that have received a voucher difference?

United Airlines Question
We are going to Kauai in January 2005. The cost of our already booked airline tickets has gone done ~$80 per person (five people). Do you know if United charges a fee to receive a voucher for the difference? doubt it, knowing the financial state United is in. Frontier wouldn't do it for us recently, either. Give you agent a call anyway, and good luck.
kikahead...Hey ,sup? Yep, I just had this happen to one of my tiekcts on Thursday...If your agent is closed,call United.They have always been very helpful to me.Best of luck!
I have a UA employee sitting right next to me and said that YES, UA will reimburse the difference. Travel agent will have to file claim....
They will do it as long as, at the time of your call, their system shows 5 seats available to your destination on the exact same flights that you've booked , now showing a lower fare.
Thank you thank you!! The travel agency is open today so I will call him and have him make the switch!
kikahead, would you please post the outcome? I always thought an airline wouldn't make any adjustments until the price difference was $100 minimum, and then with a fee charged.
Maureen...Every airline is different.American just recently changed their policy.They will all try to get us, one way or the other.
Kikahead, I would call the airline and then the agent, so you will be "armed with knowledge" talking to the agent.
Maureen, each airline has different rules. I got a $40 voucher from American for free. To use it they now have a $5 charge.
Yep, those airline vouchers have so many strings attached they are just about worthless. I still have four from United for $75 each that haven't been useful yet! I usually get better fares on the internet than I can get going directly to United, even with the $75 discount.
Well I was able to get it. The travel agent sent me back to United, they are sending a voucher for the difference. Again, Beachboi thank you so much for letting me know that United does do this!!!! We will be receiving $400 which is a notable amount!!
kikahead....Glad it worked out in your favor....Glad to help and you are soooooo right that $400 is huge.
Kikahead, don't forget to use them! within a year?

This product listing says "dual voltage" but under specifications, it says "110" next to voltage. I'm looking for a dual voltage model and just want to be sure that it can truly be used under 240V settings.

'Real Housewives of New Jersey' Update: Teresa Giudice’s Surprising New Cookbook
For her third cookbook, Fabulicious!: Fast & Fit, reality-TV star Teresa Giudice of Bravo’s Real Housewives of New Jersey (the guilty pleasure of more than 3 million viewers) doesn't include a single catty comment about her fellow housewives. That's surprising, considering how this season of RHONJ chronicles the explosive aftermath of last year's tome, Fabulicious!: Teresa’s Italian Family Cookbook, in which she managed to offend almost every one of her co-stars with comments like how her “friend” Caroline Manzo is as Italian as the Olive Garden.
While Giudice may be saving her insults for the show this time around, Fast & Fit doesn't lack Giudice's signature wackiness and features some fascinating commentary among the recipes. Here, a sampling of tips and other highlights.
“If anyone tries to throw the word gourmet around to prove their culinary superiority, you can deliver the smack-down and remind them it means greedy little servant boy [in French].”
“Cup your palm: That’s one serving size. Unless you have freaky baby hands, your body is naturally designed to tell you how much you need to eat.”
“I’ve never met an actual 'woodsman,' but I’m guessing they eat lots of mushrooms since they live in the woods and all.”
“A hot red dress makes you feel sexy and confident. A hot red pepper should, too.”
“Zucchini is a great source of manganese, [which] helps produce sex hormones (I find that funny considering the shape of zucchini).”
“Puttanesca literally means ‘prostitution whore sauce.’ There are as many variations as there are loose women in the world (sadly).”
“As far as helping your brain, sage is no joke.”

Oh Baby Baby Pizza!
The much awaited next venture and update to the old Pearl location in Richmond has not failed to deliver! We manage to snaffle one of the last seats in the house and we get to look over the antipasto bar as the guys are doing their thing. The fit out is gorgeous! Very cool but comfortable, very chic without pretention. There are some luscious accents flying around the place and it only adds to the feeling that we are somewhere fabulous on a little holiday!!
The menu is huge, there is antipasto, boards of beautiful wafer thin cured meats, insalate, salads bursting with fresh herbs and leaves, there is ragu, cheese, meatballs and ofcourse pizza!
Pizza choices are varied with but traditional toppings, plenty of ‘fior di latte’, ‘san marzano tomatoes’, ‘fresh basil’ and a touch of chilli, sausage, prosciutto and parmesan! I have a theory that the best best of any place is the Margherita, if they can do it well you know anything else you eat there will be fabulous!!
Sensational – fior di latte, san marzano tomatoes, fresh basil, sicilian olive oil. No messing just perfectly fresh and perfectly… perfect! But you know what makes any perfectly thin, amazing margherita just a touch better….
A side of anchovies please!! Oh Yes!!
As a friend would say “I love those hairy little fish!!” and they are so very loveable!!
So the place is pretty big and it is very busy, there is a fair trade for takeaway pizzas and out food did take a little while with one of our pizzas not arriving until our other friend had nearly finished but the guys at Baby Pizza handled it brilliantly and we didn’t even have to pull a face – the waiter was thoroughly lovely and apologised and offered to remove from our bill without a moments hesitation. Textbook perfect service!
Regardless we all loved our pizzas, the Salsiccia with fior di latte, spiced italian sausage, friarielle and chilli was really good! We could have gone more chilli but we love the burn!! With a no bookings policy you have to time it right but it is so worth the trip!
Exceptional Pizza Baby!!

My latest piece for lovefood.com, a tale, of friendship, good food, and a young family facing tough times.
Before Christmas we ran a competition to win £500 worth of le Creuset kitchenware and a years supply of stock from our friends at Knorr. To enter, we asked which one of our tasty recipes you would cook in the pans if you won.
One entry stood out as the clear winner. User stevewestcliff wanted the prize not for himself, but for a young family who he'd befriended over the years. This selfless act of friendship, we felt, was the true meaning of Christmas, and so we chose Steve as the winner. This was his reply when I contacted him…

You voted for it and here we have it, the New Croque-Monsieur, FoodMayhem style. In preparation for our super awesome Grilled Cheese, Lon made mustard, and I made Challah (Peter Reinhart’s recipe). The Challah should be made and sliced the day before so that it can stale. (Don’t worry, I ate plenty of it fresh that day too. )
New Croque-Monsieur
~Serves 4
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 4 (roughly 7″ x 3.5″ x 1″) slabs of day old Challah
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, divided
- 2 tablespoons Sweet & Spicy Mustard, divided
- 4 oz shredded Gruyere, divided
- 6.4oz ham (Niman Ranch Jambon Royale), divided
- freshly ground black pepper
Instructions -
1. In a pan or dish large enough to hold all the bread in one layer, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, sugar, and salt. Lay the Challah flat in the pan. Let it sit for 30 minutes. Turn it over and let is sit for another 30 minutes.
2. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter on medium low heat, on a cast iron skillet. Place two pies of challah on the skillet. (The side you cook first will end up being the inside of the sandwich. )
3. When the challah is golden on one side, flip one piece over. Spread 1 tablespoon of mustard on. Sprinkle 2 ounces of gruyere. Lay on ham. Sprinkle with black pepper. Place the other piece of challah on top, uncooked side facing up.
4. When the bottom is golden, flip entire sandwich over to finish the last side. When the last side is golden, remove from heat and cut in half.
5. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make another large sandwich (again cutting in half to make two)..
I wanted to add in a comment or two just about the taste of this sandwich. It was ridiculously good. Jessica and I sat around moaning about the flavor. It is a bit sweet from the french toast and the mustard, a bit salty from the gruyere and ham, a bit tangy from the mustard and the pepper, it’s rich from the ham and the egg, and each bite melts in your mouth from the challah and the cheese.
Oh man, seriously, it has everything. This has got to be the winningest Grilled Cheese sandwich for Grilled Cheese month.
Hi Jessica,
Thanks for stopping by my blog…you got it, there’s no going back after panko
Now this sandwich, mmmm mmmmm mmmmmm, looks absolutely delicious, wow.
oh wow – there’s this french bakery/cafe here who features the croque monsieur… i’m sure yours would beat theirs by a mile!
MMMMMM….wow, this new croque monsieur sure gets my vote! yummie twist!!
Fabulous! Thanks for the recipe.
so THAT’S what a perfect breakfast sandwich looks like. good to know.
This is a serious eggy bread recipe Jessica!!
I love the photo’s, thank you for sharing ;0)

This dressing is amazing! I will never again buy ranch dressing from the store. It was so easy to make. I cut back on the dried dill by half, but only because my family isn't crazy about dill. I will definitely be making this again!

A manufacturer of confectionary ginger is developing a new processing system that eliminates the need to use sulphites as a preservative, making its ginger products allergy-free.
Buderim Ginger, which is based in Australia, has been awarded AUS $245,100 (€123,000) in government funding to investigate a processing system that uses chlorine dioxide rather than sulphites, which are a recognised allergen, particularly for people with respiratory disorders.
The development would help the company tap into the growing “free-from” market which has largely been fuelled by the rising number of people with food allergies, according to analysts.
Steve Dennis, process and engineering manager at Buderim, said the funding, awarded under Queensland’s State Government’s Business and Industry Transformation Incentives scheme, would cover research into the performance of chlorine dioxide, the development of an automation system and the undertaking of trials.
He added: “This funding will help us transform our operations and enhance the products we deliver to our customers which is the most important aspect of our business.
“By having an allergen-free product, with no sulphites, we will be able to deliver even healthier ginger products into new markets in Australia and overseas.”
Buderim, which is described as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of confectionary ginger, has the capacity to process over 5000 ton of ginger per year. It also exports to more than 17 countries including the USA, New Zealand, Europe and Asia.
Manufacturers face strict regulations regarding the labeling of allergens used as an ingredient. For example, under current EU allergen labelling rules, companies are required to lable all pre-packed foods if they contain any of 12 listed allergenic foods, which includes sulphites.
Queensland Industry Minister, Desley Boyle, who announced the funding, said that the current trend in food processing was to remove sulphites and that Buderim was investigating the new processing system “to maintain its competitive edge, and to safeguard its export market”.
Free-from market
The "free-from" food market has been enjoying sales growth, with of over 300 per cent reported in the UK alone since 2000, as a result of growing numbers of people with reported food allergies, according to market analyst Mintel.
However, half of the reported food allergies amongst adults are not food allergies at all, according to a paper published in the journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt International.
It said that between 10 and 20 per cent of people see themselves as suffering from a food allergy, but the real figure may be half this.
The Wurzburg University study reported that, of the 419 people with suspected food allergies tested, less than 50 per cent actually had a IgE-mediated food allergy.
According to Allergy UK, 45 per cent of the UK population face food sensitivities at some point in their lives, and two per cent suffer from a food allergy.

The dust has settled and another SXSW is in the books. If you’ve been following along along, you may have known that I presented this year with Will Turnage something called, “My Robotic Kitchen Planned this Dinner Party.” The talk outlined how technology in the kitchen needs to be used to analyze the holistic cooking experience rather than just focusing in isolation on a few discrete tasks. We had a great turnout and a receptive crowd, and you can listen to a full audio recording of the talk and see the slides embedded below from Slideshare.
In the talk, we demoed a rough prototype of a dinner planning app we built as a proof of concept. The app empowers a dinner party planner to customize, scale, and shop for a menu, then organize all of the required steps into one master to-do list. The central inspiration for what Will and I created is essentially a digitized version of the professional chef’s mind, where flexibility and adaptation are the hallmarks of the cooking approach…
We think that this approach represents a different way of looking at cooking instruction from what you typically find out there today. For instance, anyone can easily discover 3 recipes on any recipe site, but each of those recipes still exist in their own silo. The roast chicken recipe has no idea its being cooked with the roasted brussels sprouts and a side and apple pie for dessert. You still need to make your own mental leap to unify the steps of these dishes into one single to-do list and have a meal that’s efficiently prepared and well timed.
Someone who’s an experienced cook or professional chef naturally knows how to get all three of these things onto the table with minimal drama, but for most people, this kind of thing presents a challenge. Herein lies the gap in showing you how to plan and execute a dinner party and we think there’s real value in figuring this and many other problems out with technology.
There’s much more to be done, and the playing field is wide open for where this can go. At the end of the day, I believe that great things happen when you cook for those you care about. Knowing that, I wish everyone could cook more for the people in their lives and have the same great experience I’ve had doing the same. To the extent that I can help lower the barriers to cooking through technology, content, and inspiration, I will, and this is just the start.
Take a look/listen to the presentation and let me know what you think. Would this approach be valuable to you? Leave us a note in the comments.

Gabriel Heinze and French full-back Loic Nego have officially signed for Roma.
The Giallorossi have been in advanced negotiations with both players and the Lega Calcio has already received the contracts.
A statement on the Roma website this evening confirmed Heinze has signed a one-year contract with an option for a second term.

20-year-old Nantes right-back Nego has also completed his transfer to Roma.
Meanwhile, elsewhere in Serie A, Cesena have officially signed midfielder Roberto Guana from Palermo on a two-year contract.

Bury moved into play-off contention by securing a 2-1 win over Bournemouth thanks to first-half goals by Stephen Dawson and David Worrall.
Brett Pitman scored an injury time consolation for the hosts but it made no impact on the outcome of the match.
Barnet lost out to Lincoln City at home after a late Lenell John-Lewis goal snatched victory for the visitors.
It looked as though Ismail Yakubu had secured a draw after cancelling out Lincoln's opener by Cian Hughton but the home side couldn't hold on to secure the point.
Burton's Greg Pearson scored a second-half equaliser to secure a point against Shrewsbury who had taken the lead through Dave Hibbert just before the half-hour mark.
Barry Conlon scored the only goal of the game as Chesterfield edged past relegation-threatened Torquay United at Saltergate.
Dagenham & Redbridge beat Crewe Alexandra 2-0 thanks to first-half goals by Josh Scott and Danny Green, while the match between Grimsby Town and Cheltenham Town ended goalless.

McCourt delivers for Celtic
Published : 14 Aug 2010 15:01:07
Paddy McCourt seized an early chance to prove he can fill Aiden McGeady's boots as his superb strike earned Celtic a winning start to their Clydesdale Bank Premier League campaign at Inverness.The winger was handed the left-wing berth 24 hours after McGeady completed his £9.5million move to Spartak Moscow and he repaid Neil Lennon in style in the 56th minute head knock that ended his involvement.Lennon would have been equally pleased to see his defence keep their first clean sheet since the summer break, a run that included eight friendlies and two Champions League games against Sporting Braga.

McCammon rejects Dover loan move
Published : 01 Apr 2010 13:25:57
Blue Square South side Dover Athletic have made an ambitious bid to sign Gillingham striker Mark McCammon.The 31-year-old has only played one league game for the Gills since the New Year and recently returned from a loan spell with Bradford. Gillingham agreed to the move but McCammon turned it down. "I made the call and Mark Stimson was happy for us to have him but sadly the lad didn't want to come," Dover boss Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio Kent. "That's his prerogative.

Brown thinking of January
Published : 29 Jul 2009 10:03:48
Phil Brown has admitted that he is already looking ahead to the January transfer window as a crucial period in Hull City's campaign. The Tigers made a stunning start to the season 12 months ago but then suffered a dramatic slump and only just avoided relegation. Brown hopes his men will get off to a flyer once again but then realises he will have to be more proactive in bringing in fresh faces in the New Year. He explained: "The lesson I learned from the majority of last season was to improve in January in terms of the transfer window. "We only brought maybe one or two in the January transfer window last season. "One of the main deals we were trying to get on the table was Jimmy Bullard and obviously it is well documented that he picked up an injury in his first game. "If." Survival Brown accepts that he will need a larger squad to remain competitive for the whole season, although he is refusing to set any targets other than survival. "In terms of the numbers of the squad last season, it was critical towards the end that we were using the full squad as opposed to using the same 12 to 15 players and consequently that took its toll on us at the end of the season," he said. "The powers that be turned against us to a certain extent last season however there were three teams that were worse off than us. "So long as we improve on last season that is the main aim this year. That leaves it wide open from 16th first."

Republic of Ireland 0-0 Slovakia: Match Report
Published : 02 Sep 2011 22:00:41
Robbie Keane passed up a glorious opportunity to snatch victory against Slovakia as the Republic of Ireland's hopes of automatic qualification for Euro 2012 were dealt a major blow.
The Los Angeles Galaxy striker headed wide from just five yards with 16 minutes of the game remaining, with the visitors having enjoyed the better of the game until that point.
Damien Duff had earlier forced a good save from goalkeeper Jan Mucha with a 38th-minute shot which clipped defender Martin Skrtel, but Slovakia were more than value for their point with Shay Given having to make first-half saves from both Vladimir Weiss and Filip Holosko.

Inter supporters waved inflated bananas and whistled at Balotelli during the 1-1 draw at the San Siro.
However Balotelli, who played for Inter between 2006 and 2010, helping them to a treble in his final season with the team, kept his composure and responded simply by holding a finger to his mouth during the second half.
Balotelli has already scored four times since joining Milan from Manchester City last month but he failed to find the target on Sunday.
The 22-year-old had three chances in the derby, drawing a great save from Samir Handanovic at one point with a header.

2005 Away Opponents: SD, SF, OAK, SEA, PHI, NYG, WAS, CAR
Vivek: So we have Drew Bledsoe reunited with Bill Parcells, the team signs Jason Ferguson and shifts to a 3-4 defense, and all of a sudden this is supposed to be a .500+ team? I just don't see it. This is a good up and coming team with Julius Jones in the backfield and Roy Williams hitting everything in sight in the secondary, but Dallas is a year away. Its success depends on the development of first round defensive ends Demarcus Ware (who may move to the linebacker spot in the new 3-4 defense) and Marcus Spears. With change to a 3-4 scheme, Parcells is effectively reducing the role of Greg Ellis, his leading sack man for the past four seasons. I am curious to see how he and veteran La'Roi Glover handle this.
What does Bledsoe have around him on the outside? Whatever it is, he will have to find it quickly as the not so fleet footed Bledsoe will have the aging Marco Rivera and Larry Allen protecting him. The Buffalo offensive line wasn't the only factor in opposing defenses sacking Bledsoe almost three times per game during his tenure there. That is the whole key to Bledsoe's success --give him time, and he will produce. Keyshawn Johnson, Terry Glenn, and Quincy Morgan are all nice pieces, but will not be able to bring Bledsoe back to his form from six years ago. Add in the fact that all three are coming off of surgeries, and that cannot make Bledsoe feel too confident. Tight end Jason Whitten might be Bledsoe's most reliable weapon, similar to what he had in New England with Ben Coates.
I might be being too harsh on this team, but out of division games against the Broncos, Chiefs, Rams, Raiders, Charger,s and Panthers do not hurt my case. A year from now I'll take the over but for 2005, I'm predicting a .500 record and the UNDER.
Al: Finally, some serious disagreement between us. I'm expecting Dallas to be one of the top teams in the NFC and possibly the favorite to be playing in February if Terrell Owens isn't lining up wide in Philadelphia for a full season.
There are a lot of reasons, other than the personnel upgrades, to expect Dallas' offense to significantly improve this year. (For more details, read the Dallas (written by yours truly) and San Diego chapters of the top-selling football book on Amazon.com). As is pointed out in much more detail in the book, Dallas was terrible passing the ball on third down last year. Even a moderate improvement in that category could lead to significant overall improvement in the team's offense. Also, Vinny Testeverde was atrocious in the fourth quarter last season. With a younger quarterback than Vinny behind center, Dallas could expect to have more consistency in game performance across all four quarters from Bledsoe than they got from Testeverde.
I am concerned about the secondary, which was Dallas' weak link last year. Their starters should be improved with the additions of Anthony Henry and Aaron Glenn, but I have serious concerns about the depth behind those starters. If Henry, Glenn, or Terrence Newman gets injured, things could get ugly real fast in Dallas.
In any event, this team should go at least 9-7, even if they don't reach the Super Bowl contender status that I'm expecting from them. OVER.
O/U: 11
2004 Record: 13-3
2005 Home Opponents: SF, OAK, SD, DAL, GB, SEA, NYG, WAS

Vivek: T.O. isn't the only one who has to take care of his family this year. I have a down payment and wedding to plan for, and if Terrell Owens doesn't suit up for the Eagles, I'll have to keep my day job because I am sticking with the Eagles this year. T.O. or no T.O, This team is a regular in the NFC title game, and the secondary of Lito Sheppard, Sheldon Brown and Michael Lewis can ensure that the Eagles will not need to score 30 points to win. This will essentially be the same defensive unit went to the Super Bowl last year, minus a handful of players who did not make much of an impact. If the defense can execute Jim Johnson's pressure filled schemes, you should see a something along the lines of last year's 17 interceptions and 47 sacks.
Even with a first place schedule, this team can approach last year's win total. OVER.
Al: This team has won at least 11 games for five straight years. The presence or absence of Owens probably will be the difference between this team having a tough run in the playoffs, or having a cake walk to another NFC Championship. Last year's Super Bowl team is returning virtually intact. The only off-season departure of any significance was Jermane Mayberry who left for New Orleans. But the Eagles have a replacement waiting in the wings with last year's first round pick Shawn Andrews. Add in the best secondary and special teams in football and there's just no way I could take the under here. OVER.

Vivek: 698 and 860 yards in the past two seasons. Does that sound like #1 receiver stats to you? Plaxico Burress missed five games last year, so even projecting his stats across a full season gives you a hair over 1,000. The combo of Burress and Amani Toomer is an upgrade from last year, but not one that would vault Eli Manning into the top half of NFL quarterbacks. You know that your 2004 wide receiver corps struggled when Ron Dayne found the end zone (1) more often than the top two receivers (0). Nobody ever knows what to expect from Jeremy Shockey, so the Giants cannot depend on him as a safety net for Manning. And if Jim Miller is slow to heal from hip surgery, the Giants will be forced to go with the reality star Jesse Palmer or husband-of-a-reality-star Tim Hasselbeck. New tackles Kareem McKenzie and Bob Whitfield should, however, help sure up an offensive line that allowed 52 sacks last year.
Can Tiki Barber pile up the same yards with defenses not as concerned with Manning? He averaged 91 yards rushing and receiving for the final five games of last season (versus 150 the rest of the year) and more alarming was his four fumbles during that span. The Giants would have to give the ball to rookie Brandon Jacobs, who looks more like Julius Peppers than a running back, if Barber goes down.
Towards the end of last season, Al played "What would Ernie Accorsi do?" and wrote, ." Well, Al was ten for ten on those guys, and the Giants build around them by signing Antonio Pierce in addition to McKenzie and Whitfield on the o-line. The losses of Norman Hand, Omar Stoutmire, Ike Hilliard and Terry Cousin will have a minimal impact. OVER.
Al: It's all about Eli this year in New York. As I've mentioned elsewhere -- yes, I wrote this chapter in the book as well -- the Giants have brought in new personnel to improve every one of their weaknesses from last season save one -- starting quarterback. If Manning is the quarterback this season that he was against Pittsburgh in Week 15, the Giants will be championship contenders. If Manning is the quarterback that he was against Baltimore in Week 14, Tim Hasselbeck will become the most talked about backup quarterback in the history of sports radio. I'll split the difference and say Manning plays like he did against Dallas and Cincinnati in Weeks 16 and 17: right around league average. As long as Eli doesn't stop them, this Giant team should make the playoffs or at least be in contention for a spot until the last week of the season. OVER.

Vivek: Al, make sure to temper your enthusiasm a bit after last year's Skins' love fest. Sorry for the cheap shot. I'll note that I also predicted the demise of Curtis Martin last year.
The nation's capitol did have a good offseason in terms of made for television drama -- the drafting of a quarterback of the future when the head coach had given his endorsement for the incumbent, two star players departing for "greener" pastures and what plotline would be complete without an assault/weapons charge for last year's star rookie.
While the potential of the 2005 players might be greater than last season, this team took a big step backwards in terms of on-field talent. Patrick Ramsey only had three wins in his half season of starting, so barring a Drew Brees-like resurgence, how long until Joe Gibbs hands the ball over to Jason Campbell? And even if he does, what weapons does he have on the field with him in the aerial game? Newcomers Santana Moss and David Patten are nice second and third receivers, but cannot carry this passing game. To say that the 2004 offense never got in synch is an understatement. All season the offense looked confused, especially on third downs, an anomaly for a team with a featured back the caliber of Clinton Portis. The Skins converted less than a third of their third down attempts, which can be linked to Portis's drop of 1.7 yards per carry from his other two seasons in the league. Joe Bugel will have to simplify the offense in order to reduce the training camp errors.
The team's best cover corner, Fred Smoot, jumped ship from a Redskins team that has gone downward since his arrival there, finishing a total of 12 games under .500 his four seasons. Linebacker Antonio Pierce followed suit and headed up I-95 to Giants stadium. Because of Dan Snyder's earlier open-wallet policies, the Redskins have limited resources to replace their offseason losses. Almost a quarter of the 2005 cap is allocated to players who are not on the roster or who will not see much action. The return of LaVar Arrington (we think) should soften those blows, but do not expect a defense that will mirror last year's.
The odds makers are being pretty generous with this line, so definitely the UNDER.
Al: Don't worry Viv, I'm not making the same mistake twice. Washington appears to be the weakest team in the division. While their fellow teams in 6-10 land spent their offseason adding to their team through free agency and the draft improving their team's weaknesses, the Redskins went around trading away their one effective offensive player to give them less cap space with which to improve the rest of the squad. The defense has seen departures, injuries and legal troubles this off-season, but very few additions. On offense, Casey Rabach and a returning Jon Jansen should lead to an improvement in the running game, but Washington has replaced the departed Laveraneus Coles and, according to a report on Redskins.com, Rod Gardner with Santana Moss and David Patten. At best it's wheel spinning for the sake of salary cap inflexibility. At worst, one of the league's five worst passing offenses from 2004 will find itself sliding even further down the rankings this year.
Is there anything I like about Washington this season? Sure. Robert Royal is my fantasy sleeper TE of the year. He finished last season with four touchdowns in Washington's last five games. With an increased role in the offense, Royal is a great pick as a #2 TE in leagues where you're forced to carry a backup. UNDER.
O/U: 10.5
2004 Record: 14-2
2005 Home Opponents: OAK, SD, BUF, IND, NO, NYJ, TB, MIA
2005 Road Opponents: CAR, PIT, ATL, DEN, MIA, KC, BUF, NYJ
Al: We're completely into uncharted territory here. Only one other team has won at least 14 games in consecutive seasons like New England has: the 1985 and 1986 Chicago Bears. The next year for Chicago was the strike year, when they still managed to pull of 11 victories. The Bears kept it going into 1988, winning 12 games. What does this mean for New England? Absolutely nothing.
I want to go under, but I just can't do it. Sure, you have to wonder how the team will do after losing both their coordinators. But the personnel is just as good, if not better than it was last year, despite the departures of Tedy Bruschi and Ty Law. The wide receiver corps is deeper than ever with the additions of David Terrell and Tim Dwight. That should make up for the inevitable decline of Corey Dillon as he turns 31 after logging a career-high number of carries last year. The offensive line is back pretty much intact from last year, possibly improved with the addition of first round pick Logan Mankins.
The biggest question marks are on defense, where Bruschi is done for the year and Law is out looking for a job elsewhere. But the secondary was effective without Law for most of last season, and New England has brought in a number of linebackers to fill in for Bruschi as well as Ted Johnson, who surprised the team by retiring today. It would be nice for the Patriots if Chad Brown could stay on the field for a full 16 games for the first time since 2001, but even if he doesn't, newcomer Monty Beisel should be effective, at least on pass coverage.
The schedule looks tough, but the Patriots are still the toughest team any of their opponents will play this year. I'm glad this line isn't a half point higher. OVER.
Vivek: Have we all learned yet not to bet against Bill Belichick? The Patriots will probably slot in Deion Branch in the secondary to replace Ty Law and Patrick Pass at linebacker for Teddy Bruschi. Ok, there was sarcasm there, but how many of you would have believed that Troy Brown would make a greater impact on defense than offense last year? We are all waiting to see how Belichick will do without his right-hand men, Romeo Crennel and Charlie Weis, and that might be Belichick's greatest personnel loss during his years in New England.
So how do you beat the Patriots? You cannot stack their schedule with playoff teams, as New England has compiled a 16-1 record against playoff teams during the past two seasons. You cannot rattle Tom Brady unless maybe you bring back Tara Reid into the picture. And Bridget Moynihan may be the only one who can break through the offensive line to get to Brady. Last year the Steelers handed the Pats their worst loss when Corey Dillon sat out with a thigh injury. If Dillon misses an extended period of time, Brady and the Patriots will find life a little harder. Al is more confident about the WR crew than I am. Branch, Givens, and Terrell should not be a comforting sight if Brady has to revert to the shorter passing game from 2003. Tight end Ben Watson, who lost his 2004 campaign to a knee injury, would have to develop into a deep threat quickly.
On the defensive side, the Pats will slot in free agent signees Brown and Beisel while Bruschi sits this season out recovering from his stroke. Brown help will keep the pass rush at the top of the league, having averaged almost three a game last season. Law was the only other significant defensive loss, but Asante Samuel is emerging as a solid corner.
Another 13-14 win season is within reach. OVER.

Vivek: This Jets team is one of the hardest to predict in the league, one that could end the Patriots' run as the toast of the AFC or one that could fall flat without its leader Chad Pennington. After Pennington's rotator cuff surgery, there is still an outside chance that Jay Fiedler opens the season as the starter. Regardless of whether or not he will be under center in Week 1, Pennington has missed all of the offseason workouts with new offensive coordinator Mike Heimerdinger and his downfield attack. Heimerdinger's offense requires a quarterback with good arm strength and that's not Pennington's game. The return of Laveranues Coles and potential comeback of Wayne Chrebet will mean nothing if Pennington's shoulder does not allow the team to be aggressive. A few interceptions downfield, and Jets fans might not miss Paul Hackett's play calling so much.
Curtis Martin has to slow down one of these years, and this might be the one. Martin could miss last year's starting right tackle Kareem McKenzie, with an unproven Adrian Jones now in that spot. At least if anything does happen to Martin, Derrick Blaylock can easily step in as a different style runner.
The Jets made huge strides in 2004, but regressed this offseason. Pardon the pun, but the team is thin at the tackle spot after Dewayne Robertson. The defection of nose tackle Jason Ferguson will not only hurt Robertson, but also rising linebacking stars Eric Barton and Jonathan Vilma. Opposing teams had to devote multiple offensive linemen to take care of Ferguson, but now they can focus their efforts elsewhere.
I am not sold on Pennington's shoulder, and for that reason, I'll take the disappointing UNDER.
Al: What are you talking about Viv? This team is deep everywhere. So deep that they could spend their first draft pick this year on a kicker! (Yes, Mike Nugent bashing by Football Outsiders. Big shock there.)
Seriously, though, I agree that the Jets didn't do enough to fill the hole left by McKenzie. The Jets had one of the best offensive lines in the league last year according to the new and improved adjusted line yards. They were third in the league running behind right tackle and the best in the league running outside the right tackle. Now, a lot of that has to do with Kevin Mawae's amazing pulling, but McKenzie has to be given some of the credit as well. With an unproven right tackle, you have to expect the Jets rushing numbers to decrease, especially to that side of the line.
I really like the Blalock signing, though. He was in the top 10 in DPAR and top 5 in DVOA last year and had a positive DVOA in 2003, albeit in limited playing time. (DVOA and DPAR explained here.) He'll more than make up for the departure of LaMont Jordan and should end up with a good number of carries backing up and eventually sharing time with the sure-to-decline Curtis Martin.
That road schedule is sick. I wouldn't pencil in a single victory. The Jets aren't going to reach 10 wins without going at least 4-4 on the road, and with this schedule I just don't see it. Especially if The Chad misses more than a game or two with his inevitable annual injury. UNDER.

2005 Road Opponents: TB, NO, OAK, NE, SD, MIA, CIN, NYJ
Vivek: Run, defend, and protect young quarterback J.P. Losman. The game plan is pretty simple for the Bills in 2005. Willis McGahee gets his long awaited full-time starting job in 2005. He may not, however, put up the eye popping numbers that he did as the starter last year with this downgraded offensive line. Other than quarterback, the only other position that will feel a drop-off from last year is the offensive tackle spot after Jonas Jennings signed with the 49ers. McGahee needs to run between the tackles, and we will wait to see if Mike Gandy and Mike Williams can step it up.
I like the pickup of Kelly Holcomb to back him up if head coach Mike Mularkey feels the need to sit Losman for a bit. Losman will have a good group of receivers around him, though. Eric Moulds pulled in 88 catches last year, and the Bills will finally end their efforts to make Josh Reed a solid #2 wideout with the push of Lee Evans and rookie Roscoe Parrish.
This team was very close to the playoffs last year, and I think Buffalo will be competitive again this year, but it is hard to take the over with the Jets and Pats on the schedule for four games. UNDER.
Al: Why do odds makers think this team will do worse than last year? The loss of Drew Bledsoe and Travis Henry? I can understand the hesitation to wager that a team with essentially a rookie quarterback will have a winning season. However, J.P. Losman is unlikely to decide the fate of this team. Not when virtually the entire defense, number one in DVOA last year, is coming back for 2005 and they have a running back that PFP 2005 projects to finish among the NFL's top five in rushing yards.
The Bills' road schedule is much easier than the Jets' looks to be. As you'll read sometime in the next few weeks, I'm not sold on Tampa, New Orleans is perpetually mediocre, and I think Oakland will still struggle, especially on defense, despite their recent additions. If Buffalo can win those games and squeak one road victory out against a division rival or either San Diego or Cincinnati, they'd be 4-4 on the road and half way to hitting the over/under number. Should be an easy OVER.

Vivek: Grass Valley, California. There, I got that obligatory Ricky Williams joke out of the way.
Gus Frerote or A.J. Feeley? Ronnie Brown or Ricky Williams? Marty Booker or David Boston? If you like camp position battles, then this will be a fun team to watch. Frerote, Brown and Booker should be the opening day starters, and those are all the right calls. Feeley has proved nothing as a starter in the NFL, and Williams is nowhere near the physical shape that he was in two years ago (not to mention the mental shape).
With all the offensive struggles from last year, the defense carried this team (if you can say "carried" for a team that won four games). The Dolphins went out and signed pass rushers Kevin Carter and Vonnie Holliday, but will miss corner Patrick Surtain. Opposing quarterbacks will light up when they see an aging Sam Madison and unproven Mario Edwards and Reggie Howard lined up against wide receivers. UNDER.
Al: Maybe I'm in the minority, but I'm expecting the Dolphins to be at least mediocre this year. Williams has been knocked on more than one occasion on this site. But after Williams has had a year to recover from the wear and tear of two 380+ carry seasons, and with Brown sharing the backfield, Miami could actually have a decent running attack.
Of course, this team will only go as far on offense as their line will take them. The Miami offensive line has been awful, finishing at or near the bottom of our offensive line rankings for the past two years. Stockar McDougle will be an upgrade over John St. Clair on the right side of the line. Sprinkle in a little more Vernon Carey and a little less Wade Smith, and maybe this won't be the worst offensive line in football.
On defense, the Dolphins has as deep of a defensive line as you'll find anywhere in the league. They have two lines worth of starters on their team. An effective rotation will keep the linemen on the wrong side of 30 like Jason Taylor, Keith Traylor, and Carter fresh and more effective. The secondary was effective last year and should remain so despite the losses of Surtain to free agency and Will Poole to injury.
Miami has the easiest road schedule of any of their division rivals. If they can find a way to go just .500 at home, this team should be able to squeak out 7 wins. OVER.
Next week: AFC North and NFC North.

Am I the only one that thinks the Jets should sign Jeff George? Yeah, probably. But really... Jay Fiedler?
I'm very surprised the Redskins over/under was so high and the Giants were so low. If I were to set them myself, I'd probably go with five for Washington and eight for the Giants.
I'm a Dolphin fan, and feel that they should be able to win 6 or so games. I think there was a lot of "give up" on the team last year. They seemed to play a little better with Bates coaching. The QB play was pretty bad. Frerotte should be able to turn it up a notch. The Dolphins go from no running backs, to 3 (Brown, Williams and Gordon). They still have lots of solid veterans on defense. I see no reason why they won't be much more competitive than they were last year.
6 seems a little low for the Dolphins line. Dolfans are pretty high on this season. Any thoughts to why it's 6 games? For the record Mario Edwards has been in the league since 2000. I thinks it's safe to say he's proven how much value he has.
6 seems a little low for the Dolphins line. Dolfans are pretty high on this season. Any thoughts to why itâ€™s 6 games?
To balance out the betting. You've got to balance Dolfans who would bet the over on a 14.5 line, with (New England) fans of other (Patriots) teams who would take the under on 4.
I wouldn't be hugely surprised by anything from 3 to 9 wins from this Miami team, so 6 seems as good a place as any to start the line at.
The Jets have been one of the best road teams for quite some time now.
Heimerdinger adjusts his playcalling and schemes. He's not a square-peg-into-a-round-hole kinda guy. He'll attack defenses in different manners on a week-to-week basis. You'll see in due time. Chad Pennington can throw the deep ball. He threw the best pass in the NFL last season. Check out the AFC Wild Card game vs San Diego.
Any thoughts to why itâ€™s 6 games?
Probably because most people don't think they'll make it. I'd bet the under, for sure. I think 0-8 at home is a real possibility.
Am I the only one that thinks the Jets should sign Jeff George?
I am sure a certain ESPN.com columnist from the Atlanta area agrees with you.
RE: 6
The best pass in the nfl last year was an 80 yd td bomb from culpepper to moss that traveled about 65 in the air in detroit. But the jets pass was in a higher stakes game so i see your point. But for pure artistry i'll go with the minnesota pass.
The Jets have been one of the best road teams for quite some time now. Heimerdinger adjusts his playcalling and schemes.
The first part might be true. I don't feel like looking it up. But it's a little early to suggest how Heimerdinger is going to handle the Jets, considering he just joined the team this year. Let them play before crowning the new offensive coordinator as an improvement.
It won't take much to be an improvement over Paul Hackett.
Paul Hackett managed to direct the Jets' offense to the playoffs, then to a playoff win on the road. That puts him ahead of 28 other offensive coordinators last year, including Heimerdinger.
You may argue that the success was not Hackett's, and you may blame him for the loss in Pittsburgh. But Herm Edwards was on the sideline in Pittsburgh, too, piddling away the chance to move closer for that last FG attempt, and he still can overrule his OC.
Don't pin all your hopes on Heimerdinger.
I think Lavernio, Laverana, Lavern.. well, Coles and McCarens and Curtis Martin are going to help Heimerdinger make a splash right away. He has some weapons.
Look out Pats !
& for those of you that weren't watching the Jets every week -Hackett was awful. Painful to sit through... good quarter back coach, but I seriousely question if he will ever be an OC again.
Sometimes I wonder how Curtis Martin must feel, knowing that if he wasn't traded away from the Pats he could of had a couple of superbowl rings now...
The Cowboys won't be a playoff team unless Drew Bledsoe suddenly improves to mediocre. His passing DVOA was -0.2% and VOA was -6.4%. Testaverde was 3.2% and -0.3% respectively. Incredibly, Testaverde was a better runner too with a DVOA of -12.3% and VOA of -18%. Bledsoe's numbers were -41.5% and -42%. And Bledsoe had superior receivers in Buffalo. Looks like I'll enjoy another season of laughing at Cowboy fans. Go Eagles!
Heimerdinger has run two distinctly different types of offenses in Tennessee, so there is no reason to think he's inflexible about fitting a scheme to his personnel. (Of course, anyone who has watched Bill Parcell's post-1990 career would say the same about him, but for some reason every commentator's brain seemed to freeze right after the victory over Buffalo.) And for what it's worth, I think that Pennington is going to succeed far better in a vertical offense than he is given credit for. He spent his entire career at Marshall out of the shotgun and throwing the bomb to Randy Moss. He throws a good deep ball, and he hit on them with a high frequency last year (everyone remembers the Moss pass against San Diego, but Pennington was deadly early in the season with strikes downfield). The routes he struggles most with are deep intermediate routes, deep outs and comebacks, but even then he shows an ability to complete them. On deep passes outside the hash, Pennington tends to put a hump in the ball, with the result that the receiver is the only player able to make a play on the ball. It assures that there won't be any yac, but he can throw those routes for completions. Maybe I'll be proved wrong, but I think Pennington is going to be a much better fit than people give him credit for.
I'm not so sure the Bills had better receivers. Yes, they had good 1 and 2 receivers, but they had the worst 3 and 4 receivers in the league, no pass catching tight end to speak of, and no backs who were receiving threats out of the backfield. The Cowboys have three receivers that fit their roles well, and they have one of the best pass catching tight ends in the league (and if for whatever reason they end up re-signing Richie Anderson, they'll have a quality safety outlet). The Cowboys have a much better ability to attack all parts of the field with their passing personnel than Buffalo did.
OK, Al, you've penciled in the annual injury to CP. Three other QB's with no injuries? What are the chances of that? If TB is one, who is his backup? What do you think their record becomes then? I think you are entirely too locked in on last years news.
Looks like Iâ€™ll enjoy another season of laughing at Cowboy fans. Go Eagles!
The football The football gods do not look kindly upon childish gloating. See a) the Eagles' playoff frustrations for almost half a century; and b) the link.
Consider yourself warned, mortal!
A man is shot and nearly killed, and you're telling a football fan it's his fault for being rude? This is classless, tasteless, offensive, and worst of all, not funny in any way.
I'm surprised at the lack of outrage (thus far) at the Patriots' low O/U. You guys (Pats fans) just so used to be underestimated that you no longer bat an eye when you get a 10.5 O/U, or some bored columnist launches into one of those "Payton > Brady" articles?
For the 2-time defending champs, winners of 14+ both times, with no major personel losses, and a proven ability to overcome injuries, to get an expectation of hardly enough wins for a wildcard spot seems low.
Then again, pretty much every O/U line tends to err towards the side of caution, with no team really low or high, for obvious (gambling-related) reaons. And it's not like the casinos are in the business of losing money.
When gauged against the Eagles' 11, I think it is pretty fair. When the one good team in a horrible confrence is only pegged at 11 wins, then a good team in a conference full of competitive teams only getting a half-game demotion is a pretty nice endorsement. Also, the "no major personell loss" forgets the coaching staff and the brutal schedule of the first month.
Re: 20, 21
Since when does losing both starting inside LBs not constitute a significant personnel loss? And that assumes Richard Seymour is ready to play before the start of the season--something that doesn't look like a guarantee at this point. Not to mention losing both the O and D coordinators.
Having said all that, I still like the over. 10.5 is pretty low for NE until proven otherwise. I agree that O/U usually bunches toward the mean a little too much. Fact is, most seasons there are at least a couple 13-3 and 3-13 teams. At least.
Considering the Jets road schedule and the uncertainty surrounding Pennington's shoulder injury, I like the UNDER here.
Still don't understand why Buffalo gets no respect. Their D and special teams look outstanding. Admittedly their offense looks unsettled, but I still like the OVER.
Washington at 7.5 wins O/U ??? The writer must be on crack or something. They just lost key parts of their D, and their offense still sucks. They'll be lucky to win 6 games again.
I have a suspicion the Football Giants will exceed their meager 6.5 O/U. I think their offense will improve--that Eli will develop.
Re: Pats O/U
Also remember that the bookies offer different odds depending on which one of the Over and Under you take...
Heck, I think the reason the O/U for the Pats is so low is because they simply can't pick NE sweeping Buffalo, Indianapolis, and the Jets again. That, and the NFC South looks like a better division than the NFC West.
Then again, I think the NFC South has just as much potential to implode just like the NFC West, with Carolina the only team I'd put any trust in. So maybe it will be another cakewalk season for the Pats.

Chad's never played a full season and is coming into camp with a reconstructed rotator cuff. His offensive line took a huge hit in the off-season with the loss of McKenzie. Not pencilling in an injury for him would seem foolhardy.
Will New England be hurt if Tom Brady goes down with an injury? Most likely. But Brady has played in every Patriot game since becoming the starter in 2001. New England has ranked 5th, 12th and 8th in adjusted sack rate the past three seasons.
Could Brady get hurt and miss the entire season? Of course. But there's little evidence to believe that it's more likely to happen to him than anyone else in the league.
Any one else around the league? Anyone, in you estimation, besides CP. Wouldn't you think the odds for Brady getting injured would be going up? Certainly the league odds put him in the "lucky, so far" category.

Indy isn't in the AFC East any more, though at times it seems like it is.
billvv (#27 )--
Well, this consideration is only the East divisions. Of the 8 current pencilled-in QB starters, two (Losman, Manning) are second-year starters who should have the health of the young. Two (McNabb, Bledsoe) missed substantial time from big injuries, but otherwise were pretty steady as starters. Two (Frerotte, Ramsey) are widely believed not to really matter if they start or not, since they're essentially replacement-level anyway. Brady hasn't missed a start in 68 straight games, despite playing with a shoulder separation in much of 2002.
And then there's Chad Pennington, who if he starts every game this season, it would be the first time. Chad Pennington in the only QB in the combined Eastern divisions who both routinely misses games, and actually makes a difference if he starts. It's not a gratuitous dig to pencil in CP for his annual injury; it's a perfectly valid dig based on his performance over 4 years, compared to other QBs in the East.
"His offensive line took a huge hit in the off-season with the loss of McKenzie".
How do you know? Seems to me the Jets have him replaced already, and since no one knows what the future will bring -- this may not be such a "huge hit."
Last year the offensive line took a "huge hit" with the sudden retirement of Dave Szott, but then in came Pete Kendall and the "hit" in reality became an upgrade at the position.
I wonder how many people thought it was a "huge hit" to the Pats when Bledsoe got hurt. In steps Brady, and the rest is history.
Let Ricky Williams be the expert on "huge hits"... as for me, I'll watch the game and see what happens.
That's why you play the game !
As a dig, I'm fine with the humor of it. As fact, that you can expect an injury of a player, even a penciled injury, I have a problem with it. Also, he has recovered his form each time, unlike Bledsoe. You can call Favre lucky and Pennington unlucky, but you can't expect an outcome for either.
While the concern about Pennington's recovery from shoulder surgery is certainly valid, I don't think there's any particular reason to conclude that he's injury prone. The "never played a full season" line is a little silly inasmuch as the games missed in 2002 were not due to injury. He played 14 games that year without incident. So we're talking about two injuries, which may or may not have been flukey bad luck. The fact is that there's really no way of knowing. We do know, however, that he has no history of injuries prior to reaching the pros and that neither recent injury is of the degenerative (e.g., knees, back) or recurring (e.g., hamstring, achilles) kind. So if his shoulder is fully healed from the surgery I don't think he's at any greater injury risk than any other QB.
Football is a collision sport, and a player's ability to avoid injury generally amounts to luck and knowing how to take or avoid a hit. However, in CP's case, I'd be concerned about the health of his rotator cuff, as it sounds like something that's caused by his throwing motion. Will Carroll did some more writing on this, and I recall he said that a rotaror cuff isn't as bad for a QB as it is for a pitcher, but we'll see.
I just wanted to point out that the 1989-1990 49ers also had consecutive 14-2 seasons, like the current Patriots and the '85-'86 Bears. Like the Bears, I don't think any conclusions can be drawn from those Niners teams (who subsequently had seasons of 10,14,10,13,11,12,13,and 12 wins). Among other things, the NFC West was fairly weak during most years of the Niners great run of the 80's and 90's. Though like New England (and unlike the Bears), they had pretty good consistency at the quaterback position...
Taking the over for the Cowboys is almost as much of a gimme as the over on the Chiefs
Interesting that both the Eagles and Patriots ended up under the Vegas projections. I guess the numbers weren't that far off after all.

What a superpower wants
Baidu, the ten-year-old leading Chinese search engine firm, is developing a new mobile operating system, like Android or Windows, the Chinese media reports. What does this mean for the smart phone and mobile search/apps commerce market in the People’s Republic of China?
Earlier this year, Motorola’s announcement that its Android smart phones for China Unicom will embed Baidu as its mobile search engine was lost in media reporting regarding Google’s issues in China. This decision reflected Motorola’s bet that Baidu’s familiar search bar shall sell more Motorola phones among Chinese consumers.
However, Google’s Android platform raison d’être is to highlight the Google search engine (and various apps developed for Android OS), so that the user continues on both mobile and Internet with Google search and apps, like email. This is especially critical in the mainland China market, as it is one of a handful where Google does not reign supreme in search; China also follows the emerging markets model, where PC penetration follows mass mobile phone uptake.
As Baidu’s name evokes a Song Dynasty poem, which lyrically describes the search for the ideal amidst chaos everywhere, Baidu leaders envision China inundated by low-cost high-powered smart phones, which allows mobile search to “highlight” each user’s “ideal.” It is not just about Android, as Baidu is also working with the Symbian Foundation to integrate Baidu search into Symbian-OS phones (Symbian and its new owner Nokia have no search engine of their own to promote). According to Beijing research firm Analysys International, Symbian phones (Nokia) made up 72.1% of the smart phones sold in China during the fourth quarter of 2009. During the same period Android phone shipments were a miniscule 0.4% of the 7.25 million smart phones sold in China, yet Baidu projects more lower-cost smart phones made by many Chinese firms – based on Taiwanese Mediatek chipsets with Android OS plus radio frequency software and antenna plus touch-screen hardware case for a total bill-of-materials price of less than $60 — with volume shipments occurring by the fourth quarter this year and into 2011, in time for the Chinese Lunar New Year festival month.
By putting Baidu’s search bar into these new low-cost Android phones and possibly audaciously fielding its own mobile OS, Baidu would have extensive mobile branding and penetration with Chinese smart phone users, and retain them as desktop Internet users. Also, Baidu can embed in smart phones its Facebook-like “Baidu Space,” a SNS site that allows Chinese users to create personalized homepages with blogs and photos in a Web community.
A smart phone with a new Chinese operating system may also result in consumers using bundled Chinese “domestic” apps, like email, games, search – is this why the rumored Baidu project will most likely receive Chinese official blessing?
Having long memories, China’s Ministry of Information Industry officials recall their selection of GSM, the 2G European digital standard, under the brilliant former MII Minister Wu Ji-chuan, as the Chinese mobile standard in the mid-1990s. The GSM selection ushered into China foreign network equipment and mobile phone vendors (Ericsson and Nokia, by holding important GSM patents, occupied an advantageous position for GSM network and handset development, which left Chinese firms in catch-up mode). MII grudgingly worked with foreign suppliers, which made possible the enormous increase of Chinese mobile subscribers, and also concluded that a domestic mobile industry was strategically important for the Chinese state and economy. So this nationalist outlook led to MII adopting a Chinese 3G standard — TD-SCDMA — which became a long saga for network deployment.
Crucially, all current mobile smart phone platforms – Android, Symbian, iOS 4, Windows Phone 7, WebOS, BlackBerry, and others – pose a problem to Chinese authorities: like the 1990s GSM and CDMA network standards, all are foreign-made. Foreign firms, according to MII, take revenues from Chinese enterprises (like carriers’ networks) and consumers, as well as having the potential to embed socially “harmful” software apps into handsets, including mobile search for politically sensitive topics. Ultimately, a China-domestic smart phone operating system (with Chinese-made apps) plus a domestic mobile search engine will be the best strategic 3G smart phone combination for MII. Hence, MII will certainly lobby China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom (the three Chinese mobile carriers) to push handset suppliers like Lenovo and Huawei (plus other OEMs for new tablets, auto apps, TV set-top boxes) to adopt new Chinese mobile platforms.
Baidu’s 2009 revenues reached $631 million (comparatively, Google’s global fiscal 2009 revenues totaled $24 billion). Both Baidu and Google are clashing in a market of 450 million Chinese Internet desktop search users. Moreover, by 2014, the iSuppli research firm projects 110 million 3G phone users, all busily conducting mobile search. In the second quarter of 2010, according to Analysys International, Chinese mobile users chose Baidu first for mobile queries (34.3%). Shenzhen-based firm Easou.com (with WAP-based mobile search partnering with Chinese Web portal Sohu.com) was the second most popular choice, followed by Google.
The Chinese Internet and mobile search business currently totals $1 billion. So is the $1 billion market Baidu’s sole focus, or is the goal to buy time until revenues flow in from markets outside China?
For Baidu, success in the mainland China Internet market in the long term will not result in wildly successful revenues. But China is the one market Baidu knows best and if it lost China search market to a competitor, it can’t make up revenues in another market like North America. The challenge for many Internet players (including many game firms) in the China market is that simply, the payment and revenues model does not work in the same way as in North America, Europe, and Japan – where Internet advertising, metrics, ROI, and payments are all highly developed. Likewise in the m-commerce market, the Apple App Store model is not successful in China, as payment issues continue to plague all Chinese m-commerce sites with industry insiders whispering about recent high bad debt figures generated by Chinese iPhone users utilizing fake credit cards for game downloads.
Baidu’s longer-term strategy is to launch Internet search sites in other countries with developed advertising and revenues markets. This is why Baidu launched a search site in Japan, not an easy market (Baidu currently ranks last among Japanese consumers) – yet Japan is the second-largest advertising market in the world, dominated by Yahoo! Japan, plus Google chipping away at No. 2.
Recently Baidu announced that it will hire 30 software engineers in the United States, and this group will probably be the core team for developing search engines in other languages. However, this “globalization” recruiting project highlights Baidu’s uber-Chinese identity, as among 8,000 Baidu employees, probably only a dozen have non-PRC passports.
Many Chinese firms exhort on their company Web sites that they can develop the right products for Western and Japanese consumers. In the search world, the fundamental reason why a consumer chooses one search engine over another is “intuitiveness,” or how the algorithms “learn” by conducting searches again and again to present the “desired” information in the shortest list in the shortest amount of time — not tens of millions of irrelevant links. In a universe where most Japanese now choose Yahoo! over Google, or a South Korean favors Naver, a Russian goes to Yandex, or a Chinese user picks Baidu, or an American goes for Google (with others for Microsoft’s revived Bing), Baidu’s challenge is how quickly the highly-successful Chinese search player creates a better product so that consumers select Baidu as the top search engine across multiple markets and languages.
Breaking news: On July 27 2010 Yahoo! Japan announced that it is switching to the Google search engine as the back-end search technology. Through this significant coup Google will power more than 90 per cent of all Internet search queries in the Japan market, but the consumer user interface would be different on Yahoo! Japan and Google Japan sites. During 2001 to 2004 Google’s search engine powered Yahoo Japan’s queries until the Japanese-language site completed its installation of Yahoo’s back-end technology.
Ray,
As always, a thorough and clean assessment of the situation. But you failed to note that foreign companies can co-operate with the PRC as well as Chinese companies. I think the bias is against equity control of the asset, rather than lack of compliance with political or nat sec aims.
What I mean is, the Chinese want to own the whole thing no matter how co-operative the foreign company might be.

I write about the intersection of entertainment, tech & business.
Controversy today emerged over the language used by -, ‘girlfriend ‘girlfriend’ ‘girlfriend.
Non-issue, even more so than the last few times this came up and you’ve written about it, luckily this time around the majority seems to agree going by comments on say Kotaku or RPS:
The more militant certain people quibble about trivialities, the more it is likely to derail any bigger issue (if there is any) into ridicule and the less people are going to agree.
All that is going to come from this is that studios/publishers won’t let developers speak to “journalists” freely anymore out of fear of some misguided righteous backlash and instead send steeled PR people trained in the ways of the tongue to do the talking and one can expect even more politically correct but inherently meaningless interviews instead of honest pieces. But go on preaching if you want.
I think the “trivialities” are often the most stark examples of endemic thought-patterns, and the dismissive attitude with which people treat “trivialities” underscores how insidious these ways of thinking are.
This is the same fundamental problem as using “fag” to insult someone. The defense is, “I’m not literally saying they’re gay.” but that was never the issue; the issue is that a word which means “a gay person” is being used to insult someone. That implies that being gay is negative and to be avoided, whatever meaning you claim to hang on the word when you use it to deride.
Language is non-trivial when it reveals unacknowledged prejudices.
Entirely through? And while you started out alright trying to relativize it somewhat and put it into perspective you still got from the harmless act of a developer uttering the words “girlfriend skill tree” upon which a large amount of journalists started a collective hissy fit (I’m just wondering what’ll be next to cause such a “controversy”, the barrier for entry seems to get ever lower) to somehow talking about “endemic sexism” in the entire industry and frustration and disgust this might apparently cause.
And if you are hoping “to have a conversation about who developers actually are developing for, how the market works, who they expect to play their games” etc. this will likely cause the opposite and lead to an even more locked process with only marketing bits getting through and developers not being allowed to talk at all (or even less than already).
This was an interesting glimpse into the decision process of one of the largest publishers, if you want to look for a problem maybe begin there:
Kotick also put it rather bluntly in another article: “Most of the 20 years, that I have provided for growth at Activision, we were content to make products that are attractive to the 16-35 year old guy who has gotten no date for Saturday night.”
Another recent game with a “girlfriend mode” is also Divinity: Original Sin:
Going to have to side with dexter in large part here. This might be a bit of a shocker but men and women are different! :-O
Being so consistently PC and thin-skinned is likely just to lead to people not wanting to speak to journalists for fear of being called racist/homophobic/sexist/whatever.
Fact is that many video gamers are male, and many women are just not as good at games. Heck, even my father who is not exactly a tech guru, knows more about gaming and the computer then my mother. It’s not a slight to her or any other woman, we’re just different. My wife is legally blind and her artwork is about 10x better then mine. It’s not a slight to me, we’re just different. Speaking of a “girlfriend” mode or what-not is shorthand. We understand what it means and we also all understand that there are women who are good at playing games. There are male and female pro League of Legends players who I’m sure could wipe the floor with me and my Kayle. However, such short-hand is still readily intelligible to any of us. Can we just speak without having to constantly check ourselves against the PC dictionary of today’s acceptable language?
P.S. Insults are obviously in a different category.
They could have named it “Significant Other Mode”, and with the tagline: “you have to play SOM to get some”
But you see, that’s actually mildly clever and takes a modicum of effort. Much easier to say “lol girlfriends can’t play video games.”
“But the culture that created the idea, and why it is perpetuated – and why it feels so natural as a way to explain the concept of variable-difficulty co-op: that’s an interesting subject.”
***
It’s also something the gaming industry needs to seriously consider from a purely business prospective. In the USA 47% of gamers are women, so it makes zero sense to make sexist comments that could cost you almost half of your prospective customers.

We provide a continually improving collection of questions and answers
Answer by Jamie Talbot,
Up-front, let me say that I’m a senior software engineer at StumbleUpon, and am thus unashamedly partisan, and also that this is my personal response, not the company’s.
First up, I reject the premise of the question. StumbleUpon does on the order of 1 billion referrals a month. I don’t think you can call any product that does that “failing”!
To the degree that traffic has declined over the last few months, there are a couple of factors that were probably influential, including the removal of some non-core features, which long-time and power users liked (blogging, for example), changes in referrals to StumbleUpon from places like Facebook and Google, and the rise of other companies competing for a user’s time.
The good news is, we’ve listened to our users and are working hard to deliver features that we know they want. (Reading that back sounds like marketing guff, but it happens to be true.)
We’re investing heavily in our recommendation platform to build on what is already great technology – you can see slides from a recent talk here:… and we’re on track to re-invigorate all aspects of Stumbling.
I can’t be more specific than that at the moment, but I will say that internally we’re confident of a pick-up and excited about what’s coming next. You should take a look at our new iOS application (out yesterday!) for a taste.

I write from the left on politics and policy. published in the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
It would appear that Governor McDonnell was handed the plum assignment of firing the opening shot in the launch of Governor Romney’s TV offensive beginning today claiming that the President is doing away with the work requirements for welfare so that he can hand out taxpayer dollars to those unwilling to work and move his socialist agenda forward.
Can a Vice-Presidential offering for the Virginia governor be far behind?
The McDonnell editorial picks up on—and seeks to revive— last month’s failed GOP effort to create an overblown reaction to a tweak in the TANF laws. TANF is the Clinton welfare reform legislation—crafted through negotiation with Newt Gingrich into a bi-partisan Act of Congress—requiring that those receiving welfare assistance be actively seeking or performing work.. These states have discovered that the federal requirements are tying up too many welfare workers and resources with cumbersome paperwork, resulting in less time being spent by welfare workers on actually helping those getting assistance find the work they need to keep, and ultimately no longer need, the government aid.?
Not only are the Republicans going bananas over the President’ decision to show a little election year respect for the concept of more state control, they are doing so in typical, GOP fashion—a coordinated effort to make something big out of something remarkably small.
Say what you will about the well-executed GOP plan to oppose the President at every possible turn, but you certainly cannot criticize their ability to do so in an organized and coordinated manner. Run a Google check on the decision to permit the waivers and you’ll find page upon page of headlines utilizing the words “Obama Guts Welfare Work.” Nowhere will you find headlines or statements suggesting “Obama Modifies Welfare” or “Administration Gives More Control To States In Nod To Local Control”.
Rick, I stumbled upon your writings a month or so back, and oh what a relief it is to read the writings of someone so level-headed and calm nowadays. The misinformation one can find in the “news” as of late has made it mind-numbingly hard to find true news. Be it right or left leaning they just don’t take the time to tell all of the facts, rather cherry-pick what fits their agenda. Even sadder, they often ignore the facts and just make crap(grr, I hate changing my language for the delicate constitution types out there) up.
Anyhow, excellent reporting, and keep the truth flowing. I love the “Token Lefty” title.
I’m stunned and sickened by how the GOP has become a gang of lying thugs; maybe they always were, and I’m among the last to figure it out. I want to believe that I can learn something from everyone, and that no side is strictly “good” or “bad.” I’ve had a personal experience with the GOP’s deliberate misreporting of this issue. Here is a headline that was posted on the Eagle Forum (7/20/12, 9:17 a.m., PST), linking to Dick Morris (7/19/12): “Obama Repeals Welfare Reform.” At the time, I had Eagle Forum on my FB page (because I like to hear from both sides on issues, even some extremists). But the egregious lack of journalistic integrity took me aback, because this was merely a video of some evangelical (Dick Morris?) spewing opinionated rhetoric and avoiding specific detail. He posted no link to the Act or amendment that he spoke of! When I looked it up, myself, I could see that his assertions weren’t at all supported by the facts. “Repeals” was a blatant and malicious lie. And of course, he was peddling his book. I responded on Eagle Forum’s post, explaining that the word “repeal” was blatantly misleading, and I gave links to the black-letter law and explanations (Why did I think that they even cared about the truth?). I even used one conservative site’s link: I was respectful and tactful. That’s when Eagle Forum blocked me from commenting.
Rick, I think you actually make a very valid point here.
As you mentioned, it IS an election year. I commend Gov. Romney for running his campaign exactly like our current President runs his.
In the immortal words of Saul Alinsky: “The means justify the ends when it will work.”
I want to make sure I’ve got that right; Rick’s post is about an instance where the GOP is manipulating an Obama action that they actually WANTED just for the sake of making him look bad. And this isn’t the first time (let’s also remember that Obama’s evil ACA takes its basic design from Romney’s own health care reform in MA).
You’re going to have to tell me what the Dems are misrepresenting. I’ll agree Harry Reid may well have to “put up or shut up” over his claims that Romney hasn’t paid taxes, but it’s not impossible and we don’t know it’s not true. As for Bain… I see nothing being misrepresented at all. If Romney is running on his business experience (which is fair and worthwhile for him to do), he can’t ignore the damage that business went on to do after his “retroactive retirement”.
Oh yes, I have incredibly low expectations for almost any politician, especially in the midst of an election. Our President knows it; his challenger knows it.
Good job on this one Rick. Again, I think you described this situation clearly and fairly. I’m always on the side of the states to have the flexibility to adjust programs to meet the needs of their citizens.
Thank you for your vigilance. You have your thumb on the beat of insanity in this nation. I don’t think this issue would have popped up if it wasn’t for the apparent fact that the Republicans are growing desperate and would do anything to escape the consequences of your last article.
This man is insane. Mr. Romney’s for State’s Rights. He’s against State’s Rights. This is just an attempt to get the word “welfare” and “Obama” into the same sentence. The Republicans are banking on the belief that their supports will never understand the incongruity.
I think this column is an excellent companion piece to your previous column on Sen. Reid’s accusations on Romney’s taxes. This welfare modification and the Republican response is exactly why some of us felt schadenfreude at the mess Reid was kicking up. Yes, it was wrong and we’re above that, but it just felt SO good.
Now we are back to the current reality of Democrats doing good things to actually govern our country in a responsible and reasonable way only to have Republicans lie about what is happening to make us look bad. Seems the only choice we have is to play Charlie Brown with a football to the Republican Lucy or sink to their level. Frankly, I am tired of having the football pulled away and want to bash Lucy about the head and shoulders with it. This is wrong of me, I know, but I am at the end of my patience in dealing with the do-nothing Republican liars.
I wish the President would grab Willie Brown out of SF and fly him to Washington. Mr. Brown could show those folks in Washington really how to screw with a minority party.
OweBama (D) has NEVER done real work in his life — a yapper, not a leader.
He is a leadership FAILURE — food stamps, JOBLESSNESS and TAXPAYER DEBT are his accomplishments. He defeated a worn-out Navy pilot.
The faster OweBama (D) is separated from the public tax-teat, the better the USA will be.
If OweBama (D) is re-elected, the USA will be third-rate (D).
Great reporting, Rick. As an ex NYC street fighter, I would love to take this lying sack, Romney, into the school yard, and beat the living crap out of him. But, alas, I’m 50 years too late.
For a man like Romney, shameless as he is, and who claims to be so religious, perhaps he thinks in the end, he can buy his way into heaven.
The only reason any sane person would have voting for him? They must hate Obama so.
Ha Ha! I never said I was a GOOD street fighter. Where I grew up, you either fought your way to the end of the block, or talked your way to the end of the block. After a few busted heads, fat lips, and a broken nose, I became a pretty good talker.
Off topic, I know, but when Romney talks, ever notice that face he makes after a statement, where he purses his lips together, and nods to the audience? Classic body language indicating a lie. He does it ALL the time. Just sayin’
Rick, I commend you for including a link to the letter signed by Romney and most other governors, but apparently none of your commenters bothered to actually read it to see how you misrepresented what it said to make your biased “case”. The letter specifically asks the feds to provide ongoing vs. annual funding so the states can plan and execute TANF better. The “State Flexibility” paragraph asks for more state control over work requirements so more people can be moved “FROM WELFARE TO WORK”! They certainty did NOT ask for a waiver of work requirements as Obama has done, in the face of recent surveys that show over 65% of those surveyed favor solid work requirements for welfare recipients. And you are tying together two instances that were TEN years apart.
I encourage your readers to get the view of Heritage or some other reputable source for the basic facts on what the Republicans are arguing about before they once again drink the liberal Kool-Aid…

!ENTITY % HTML.Version "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"> Economics DepartmentUndergraduate ProgramsMinor in Economics Back to Undergraduate Programs Minor in Economics Minor in Economics at Fordham College Many students in Fordham College and in the Gabelli School of Business choose to complement their major with a minor in economics. The minor sharpens one's analytical skills and provides a clear and concise way of thinking that is helpful in addressing problems and issues throughout life. The economics minor is an excellent complement to a degree in philosophy, history or political science for students considering law school. The economics minor can provide a student with a competitive edge when applying to a graduate business school, indicating to such schools that the student is capable of rigorous analytical work in the demanding fields of micro and macro theory. Students interested in public sector or international affairs careers are well served by the economics minor, as they have been exposed to economic decision making and policy evaluation. Finally, the economics minor is favorably viewed by many corporate job recruiters as an indicator of the student's analytical abilities and commitment to a challenging academic program. Fordham College If you are in Fordham College, the minor in economics consists of six courses: Basic Macroeconomics Basic Microeconomics Statistics I or Macroeconomic Analysis or Microeconomics Theory Three upper level electives (3000 level courses) If Statistics I is selected for the core, then Macro Analysis and/or Micro Theory can be used as electives. The Basic Macro and Basic Macro courses also satisfy Fordham College's social science core curriculum requirement. Courses such as ECRG32240 World Povery, ECRG3210 Economics of Emerging Nations, ECRG3235 Economics of Latin America, ECRG 3242 Global Economic Issues ECRP 3570 Labor Market and Diversity,andECRP 3580 Economics of Diversity can be double counted to satisfy both Fordham College's global or pluralism distributive requirements and the economics minor. Students who are planning to complete an MBA in the future are advised to take Macroeconomic Analysis and Microeconomics Theory as two of their three upper level electives. A third course could be Math for Economists. Gabelli School of Business GSB students may minor in Fordham College. Because of its strong analytical content, an economics minor will complement the business concentration and enhance job search upon graduation. Because GSB students have already taken Basic Macroeconomics, Basic Microeconomics and Statistics I, they only need to complete three 3000-level economics courses for an economics minor. Note, however, that a course used towards the Business Administration concentration can not also be used to satisfy the economics minor. For example, if one wishes to use an economics course such as Money and Banking towards the Finance concentration, it can not also be double counted towards the minor in Economics. Course recommendations for different concentrations are as follows. Finance concentration Students should give serious thought to the following courses, especially if they are considering a career in Wall Street: Macroeconomic Analysis; Money & Banking; Financial Markets; International Finance; International Economics; Emerging Financial Markets; Issues in Financial markets; and Computer Applications in Economics. Accounting Complementary courses include Managerial Economics; Microeconomic Theory; Economics of Emerging Nations; Health Sector Analysis. Marketing and Management Systems Courses to consider include Managerial Economics; Microeconomic Theory; Health Sector Economics; Economics of Emerging Nations; World Poverty; International Economics Students who are planning to attend a graduate business school will find that Mathematics for Economists will provide them with the mathematical skills required by most graduate business programs. Macroeconomic Analysis and Microeconomic Theory are strongly recommended. There is no difference in course requirements between an economic's minor from Fordham College and a secondary concentration in Business Economics from GSB. One could argue that it is more interesting to potential employers that a student has received a minor from a liberal arts program, rather than a secondary concentration from the same school.

For. Those who resisted or tried to hide food were deported to the Gulag or executed. Whole parts of the Ukrainian countryside turned into death zones. Millions perished, yet Stalin managed to silence all talk of the famine, sending those who breathed a word of it to labor camps in far-off Siberia. The census data, which would have shown a huge spike in mortality rates, were locked away for half a century.
But even before the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, Communist Party leaders in Ukraine started investigating the famine in their own party archives. They found a wealth of gruesome documentation. Some of the most shocking evidence came from photographs of starving children with skeletal heads, ribs poking through their skin, begging for a scrap of food on the pavement in Kharkov, Ukraine's capital at the time of the famine. One picture showed emaciated corpses piled onto a cart, drumstick limbs akimbo amid a tumble of bodies. These were not a few isolated snapshots -- there were hundreds of images. Leonid Kravchuk, who would later become Ukraine's first democratically elected president, was one of the first to see this evidence. He was so haunted by the faces of the children killed by the famine that he persuaded Vladimir Ivashko, then the first secretary of Ukraine's Communist Party, to approve the reproduction of 350 photographs in a book released to the public in 1990. Today, the famine is officially and universally remembered across Ukraine as the Holodomor, literally "death by hunger."
A man-made disaster of even greater magnitude. As in Ukraine, everything was collectivized:.
Other documents presented the famine's horror in the sterile
language typical of communist bureaucracy. A police report I discovered in one
provincial archive listed some 50 cases of cannibalism, all in a city in Gansu,
a province in northwestern China:
Date: 25 February 1960. Location: Hongtai Commune, Yaohejia Village. Name of Culprit: Yang Zhongsheng. Status: Poor Farmer. Number of People Involved: 1. Name of Victim: Yang Ershun. Relationship with Culprit: Younger Brother. Number of People Involved:..

Very realistic view of mental illness in today's criminal justice system. This reality also exists for adolescents and teenagers today. They cycle in and out of juvenile detention centers and mental health needs go untreated.

Forest Society successfully raises enough to close two of four easements to block Northern Pass.
Discussions with additional landowners ongoing
CONCORD, October 29, 2012 The Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests announced today that they have successfully raised $868,500 through their Trees Not Towers campaign, enough to close on two of four conservation easements that would keep Northern Pass towers and powerlines from being built on the protected acreage.
“We are working on the due diligence required to close all the transactions,” said Jane Difley. “We are scheduling the closings over the winter, with the first to occur in December.”
Fundraising to complete the Trees Not Towers campaign to thwart Northern Pass will continue into the new year. Donations can be made via Forest Society website at.
“A number of key donors of told us that it would be helpful to be able to make donations in the 2013 tax year,” said Susanne Kibler-Hacker, vice president of development for the Forest Society. “landowners have signed purchase-and-sale agreements that enable us to meet our donors’ requests.”
The Forest Society also continues to engage additional landowners in the effort to thwart Northern Pass.
“As our blocking action falls into place, we fully expect Northeast Utilities and PSNH to attempt to squirm their way through in some other fashion,” said Will Abbott, vice president of policy/land management. “Other landowners are coming forward, and we are working with them to strengthen the block.”
"Our goal is to stop Northern Pass as proposed in the North Country in order to protect 180 miles of New Hampshire, including the White Mountains, from the unnecessary blight of more than 1100 towers,” Difley said. “Northern Pass’s proposal is outdated, and stopping them from moving forward would appear to be the only way to start a serious discussion of more common-sense ways to transmit electricity, such as burial along transportation corridors.”

Farmington U-15s took their first competitive steps into 11-a-side football this morning at the Market Muir.
Starting on the front foot, the home side spurned a couple of early chances but did take the lead in the 5th minute when Rebekah Brown stroked home from 8 yards. A quick-fire brace from Jodi Allison put Forfar three ahead; a lead that was extended to four when Brown herself netted her 2nd goal of the game after reaping the rewards of some good interplay between Kerri Younger and Louise Falconer. Although not under any severe pressure, the Farmington defensive line of Thomson, Simpson and Keay was well marshalled by skipper Tami Guilcher.
Deeside looked to reassert themselves in the second period, however the home side continued their composed play, introducing all five substitutes in the process. Nikki Grant fired home number five with a cultured left foot strike, with the ever dangerous Younger notching number 6 with a powerfully driven shot. Wilson finished off the Forfar scoring knocking home at the back post after another good cross from Cattanach. Farmington Goalkeeper Rachelle Milton had a sharp one handed save to make after a shot in the box from a corner before Deeside scored a consolation goal in the last five minutes.
Farmington U-15s Coach Jeff Rioch commented "We were delighted with the performance with every player contributing to a convincing win - we really could not have asked for a better start to the campaign.”
“There were a lot of pleasing aspects in particular the passing, movement and communication which was good throughout and as the girls are discovering makes the game a whole lot easier. It was great to be able to fully use all sixteen available players and being able to rotate them with no real disruption to the flow augers well for the season ahead bearing in mind we had another three girls not stripped for action.”
“It was also great to see four girls make their competitive debuts for the club, Sydney, Nikki, Rhianne and Jodi have all slotted in extremely well with last year's squad. Amber Ogg, Hannah Robb and Danielle Grant will return to the squad next Saturady as we head to Westhill,Aberdeen to play Westdyke Girls where we will be looking for a similar performance as we saw today"

The starting six for Morgan were Brianna Frick, Haley Harden, Kaelin Kuretich, Isabelle Garver, Nicole Kauffman and Danielle Gross.
First set:
Erie started the set with a serve and in less than two minutes into the game the score was 4-3 in favor of Fort Morgan. Garver stepped behind the line to serve and gained a point for the Mustangs before a missed dig gave Erie back the serve. After a strong series of volley's on both sides with a combination of passes and six spikes at the net, the Mustangs took the serve with just one more point on their board at 6-4. This was followed by another intense volley sending
Erie took the serve back at 9-6, but Fort Morgan quickly took the serve back at 10-8 with Gross at the line.
Kuretich dug a ball virtually out of the ground on defense to send it back over the net for an Erie flub for a point, and on the next volley Maddy Linton spiked the ball putting Fort Morgan ahead 13-9. Then Gross power spiked into the net, giving Erie the serve. Garver sent an ace out to Erie on their first serve for a point and to regain the serve where Kauffman stepped behind the line 14-10. Kuretich sent an ace over the net for another point putting Fort Morgan up by five points and Erie called a time out to regroup.
Kauffman continued her serve, and after another hard volley, Erie regained the serve at 15-11, but served into the net to give the serve right back to the Mustangs at 16-12. Frick stepped behind the line to serve and the Mustangs rallied a seven-point streak, before Erie regained the serve, but the damage was done at 23-14 with Morgan just two points away from the match point.
Erie volleyed their way to catch up by three points, but Fort Morgan regained the serve as Garver stepped behind the line at 24-17 to serving point 25, but after a volley the battle fell short for Fort Morgan, and Erie regained the serve at 24-18. The Mustangs struggle defensively giving up five points as Erie creeps up on their lead at 24-22, when Kuretich finally puts away the match point with a spike at the net ending the first set 25-22.
Second set:
Kauffman started the set behind the line serving up a point after five sets of volleys between the teams, but Erie quickly took the serve and tied it up 1-1.
A block at the net got Fort Morgan the serve back at 3-3 with Garver serving, but Erie took the serve back at 4-4. Kuretich with a spike at the net gained a point and the serve for Fort Morgan. With an awesome defense block at the net from Linton and Madalyn Brashears, Fort Morgan found themselves ahead by two points before giving up the ball and a point off their lead to Erie at 6-5.
Erie yet again caught up with Fort Morgan and the game -- for the next 19 points -- was a back and forth battle with each team gaining a lead by a point and then tying it and the switching leads by one point back and forth, until finally Gross served the 23rd point, gaining a two point lead. Frick and Garver put up a wall at the net, blocking a spike for the match point, with the final 25-21 Fort Morgan.
Third set:
Erie starts the serves but Frick powerfully sent it right back for a Fort Morgan point and serve. Brashears stepped behind the line and served up three points, making it 3-0 before Erie got the serve back at 3-1. After several volleys and points back and forth, Heather Coup shook up the Erie defense with her power and gained the serve back at 5-3, but Fort Morgan gave it right back with a mental collapse letting the ball drop between all six defensive players with no one making a move towards a pass.
After a few more volleys and points Kuretich served out of bounds, leaving Fort Morgan behind two points before another battle of point chasing for the next eight points for both teams and Erie took a time out.
After the time out Erie immediately regained the serve but Fort Morgan's defense shut down their lead streak and regained the serve coming back two points ahead with Garver behind the line serving. Abbey Tolson stepped in for Garver as a sub and continued Garver's hot serving streak with a streak of her own, putting Fort Morgan up seven points and two points away from the match point at 23-16 as Erie took the serve.
Karli Baker sent an ace over from the net to put the Mustangs at 24-17 with Kuretich serving. Fort Morgan flubbed a volley, missing the final point, but Erie served it out of bounds to give the Mustangs the match point in rally scoring with a final of 25-18.
"It was our first game and we were all a little jittery, but we've been working on our inner confidence at home, and I'm super proud they had each others' backs. The game is a roller coaster, but we can not be (a roller coaster) in attitude and intensity and focus, that's our new focal point and that helped us tonight," said head coach Tiffany Turner head coach.
Turner said she is really proud of the girls for their overall desire to defend the home gym and not sell themselves short, and to keep fighting. The Mustangs lost to Erie last year in a five-set match that kept them out of district play, so they came this year for redemption and earned it.
"Haley Harden did a great job, this was her first five to one setting gig on a varsity level, this was a long time coming for her with last year's setting now in college, she had to pay her dues. She knew this day was coming and she earned it. She's infectious and when she's confident it's a butterfly effect for the team, her intensity is great," said Turner.
Next game is at Sterling Thursday at 6:30 p.m. This is a team the Mustangs also lost to in a five-set match, and their looking for another redemption opportunity.

15th May 2012
Brussels, Belgium
European Parliament Building
In light of the issues presented by the European Union's CEO Coalition 'to make the Internet a better place for kids,' as well as to discuss the importance of crafting a global response, to ensure children have safe and private online experiences, FOSI held a highly interactive forum to explore these issues with the EU Commission, Parliament, key industry players and civil society.
This event allowed an informal, off the record discussion to take place between the EU institutions, industry and the non-profit sector. It proved to be an opportunity for industry to demonstrate the steps that they are taking to ensure that children remain safe and private online, whilst the Commission and Parliament were able to outline their concerns, and aims, of some of their work. The forum also permitted for vital input from civil society.
This constructive dialogue encompassed a wide range of issues including the current EU initiatives, global nature of the problems and current international responses. It also focused on industry self-regulation and the important role that effective legislation can play in this field.
For a more in-depth exploration of these issues and the outcome of the forum, we encourage you to review the post-event FOSI Brief written by Emma Morris, International Policy Counsel, which can be found

Philadelphia, PA (Sports Network) - Being from the East Coast, I have a rather simplistic notion of the Arizona climate.
I picture heat. Dry heat. Skin-leathering heat. Throw in a coyote, a cactus and some adobe and you have my version of Arizona.
Like I said, simplistic.
What I don't picture is snow. Lots of snow. Sideways snow. Enough snow to imperil a PGA Tour event.
But that's exactly what the WGC - Accenture Match Play Championship got on Wednesday when a mini-blizzard descended on the Golf Club at Dove Mountain, dropping over 1 1/2 inches of play-halting powder on the Marana, Ariz., resort.
Not a single match was completed before the opening round was suspended, and 22 golfers, including Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods, Luke Donald and Louis Oosthuizen, didn't even make it to the tee.
"It's absolutely remarkable to think one minute we're playing golf, and then within a space of 25 minutes, it turns from playable to cold drizzle to sleet and to snow," said England's Ian Poulter, who at one point refused to putt on an icy green. "It's just bizarre."
Organizers are optimistic that a Sunday finish is still possible, with PGA Tour meteorologist Stewart Williams saying he "thinks the worst of the snow is probably over for us now." But Sunday finish or not, the bizarre conditions seem avoidable and unnecessary.
Let's keep in mind, this isn't the first time winter weather has hampered play at this event.
In 2011, about an inch of snow fell before the final-round showdown between Donald and Martin Kaymer. The match started on time, but play was briefly delayed when sleet descended on Jack Nicklaus-designed Dove Mountain.
"A couple of years ago, I know that it snowed the final round here," Jason Day said Wednesday. "I've never actually played golf to the point where we've actually stopped for snow, which is kind of crazy. A little crazy for it to snow in the desert, as well. But that's just how it is. Mother Nature can just do whatever she wants."
Yes, Jason, Mother Nature is uncontrollable, but that doesn't mean we can't adjust to avoid her fickle whims.
According to last May's press release, The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain and the PGA Tour only have an agreement through this year's event. In the release, the Tour's executive vice president of championship management, David Pillsbury, stated that "We're excited to continue the long-standing tradition of world- class golf in this marketplace at least through 2014," but he didn't specify Dove Mountain as the 2014 host.
Regardless, it's time to make a change in the coming years.
The PGA Tour's winter stretch is designed to maximize optimal playing conditions while a significant portion of the country is still bringing a six- pack to the nearest indoor golf simulator. Hell, the Tour doesn't even sniff my neck of the woods until at least May, and that's the way it should be.
On Wednesday, guys had fun with the situation. Rickie Fowler had a snowball fight in the parking lot, and a slew of players took to Twitter and Instagram to document the wonderland.
It's always fun to see your favorite athletes with their guard down, but it's even more fun to see them do what they do best. In this case, what they do best is play golf, so let's get this event to a place where they can do just that.

COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO. -- One of the men accused of kidnapping and murdering a man more than a year ago has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping charges, according to the 4th Judicial District Attorney.
As part of a plea agreement, Xavier Rubalcaba-Lopez pleaded guilty to 2nd Degree Murder and two counts of Kidnapping, authorities said. His sentencing hearing is set for May 16. He faces 80-96 years in prison.
It was Jan. 2012, when police said 21-year-old Jeremy Naranjo was kidnapped from his Pueblo home. Police said he was killed and dumped on the side of a street in Colorado Springs.
According to police, the kidnapping and murder stemmed from a drug-related incident. Naranjo had dealings with at least one of the suspects in the past, police said.
Gustave Dreyer, Alfredo Velazquez and Xavier Rubalcapa were all arrested for first degree murder from the same case.

A study of 511 mammal species finds that more social animals evolve bigger brains. Cat brain size has grown less than that of cows, rhinos, and dogs.
Atop the list of brain-size-evolvers -- by a long shot -- are humans and apes. Other animals that have evolved larger and larger brains over time are the wet-nosed primates (such as lemurs), toothed whales (such as dolphins and sperm whales), single-toed hooved animals (such as horses and donkeys), camels and llamas, and dogs.
Animal suborders that did not evolve significantly larger brains include cats, odd-toed hooved animals such as rhinos and tapirs, and grazing animals such as cows and deer.
Cats, in fact, are at the bottom of the brain-size-evolving list.
When plotted against the ability of each group of animals to form stable social groups, a correlation emerges. The more socially successful animals tend to be those that evolved larger brains over time.
"Groups of species whose brain size has been increasing most over evolutionary time are those that are typically very social," study co-author Susanne Shultz, PhD, tells WebMD in an email. Shultz is a fellow of the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at the University of Oxford, U.K.
But do their big brains really make these more socially skilled animals smarter, or are they just a bunch of big-headed louts that hang out together?
"Intelligence is one of the difficult questions," Shultz says. "There is evidence from living species that those with large brains are better at learning, developing novel behaviors, adapting to new environments, and so on."
So if brain-size evolution is linked to smarts, cats would rank below cows, which would rank below dogs.
It's doubtful, however, that Shultz's research will settle the are-dogs-smarter-than-cats question. Cat lovers can always argue that cats were created smart and simply didn't need to get any smarter. Or more social.
Shultz and co-author Robin Dunbar, PhD, report their findings in the early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

(BPT) - differences, according to the Thrivent Financial for Lutherans survey, could have a significant impact on their retirement years - and their family relationships.
Men vs. women
With women living longer than men, there should be some concern about who will actually foot the bill of the costs should a woman require long-term care. With married couples, the woman is more likely to need long-term care - she will likely care for her husband during his final days, and then may rely on long-term care herself since she is likely to outlive him.
Despite that, according to Thrivent Financial's survey, males seem more versed in the topic of long-term care insurance than females. The survey indicated that men are more likely than women to own or plan to buy long-term care insurance. For example:
*.
* 27 percent of both men and women surveyed plan to purchase long-term care insurance in the future.
In short, men seem to be coming around to the necessity of preparing for long-term care, while women appear to be slower to acknowledge the need.
The sandwich generation issue: stuck in the middle - but continuing to work?
When it comes to providing care, the differences between the sexes continue. When asked how they would care for both their children and one or both of their parents or another loved one at the same time, male and female respondents had differing opinions.
* 21 percent of women would rely on the savings and assets of those needing care and continue working.
And what will you do in retirement?
Long-term care in retirement is an important issue facing both men and women but it is often overlooked during the retirement planning process. According to Thrivent Financial's survey:
* Only 10 percent of women considered the possibility of caring for someone else while retired.
* Only 6 percent of men considered the possibility of caring for someone else while retired.
In contrast, 43 percent of women and 41 percent of men plan to retire fully and devote their time to travel, philanthropy and/or hobbies. Unfortunately, many don't stop to consider the impact to those plans should the need for extended care arise. What will be given up to pay the expenses? Are family members trained to provide the type of needed health care? Who is willing to alter plans when push comes to shove?
'The disconnect between our expectations for a long, healthy and independent life and the reality of the chances of needing long-term care is staggering,'.

Recipe from Kathleen McMahon of New York
Directions:
In a deep wok type pan pour enough extra virgin oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Saute chicken tenders seasoned with garlic pepper until just about done. Add chili powder (enough to cover all of the chicken) then add red peppers, green peppers and onion, saute with chicken until tender. Add tomatoes and beans, then add the uncooked rice and let the entire pot stew over medium heat. Cook until rice is done. You may need to add more crushed or diced tomatoes because rice will absorb fluid. If you want it spicier, add more chili powder and/or black pepper. You can also use jalapeno peppers to add real zest.

Machines Take Over Wall Street
“[John, holding a gun to his head]
Terminator: You cannot self-terminate.
John Connor: No, you can’t. I can do anything I want. I’m a human being, not some . . . damn robot.
Terminator: [correcting him] Cybernetic organism.
John Connor: Whatever! . . . .
Terminator: Based on your pupil dilation, skin temperature, and motor functions, I calculate an 83% probability that you will not pull the trigger.”
“Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines”
If it weren’t so serious, it would really be pretty funny. Just imagine – computers controlling Wall Street trading go berserk – film at 11! Well, that’s pretty much what recently happened.
Within the last few years, some strange things have been happening on Wall Street. It seems that the computers which engineer trades faster than humans can follow, recently went stone cold bonkers again – the digital version. Instead of discharging their programmed duties, the trading computers on the morning of Wednesday, August 1, suddenly flooded the market with millions of trades . . .
The story has been unraveling ever since.
A maverick algorithm, those mathematical Zen koans, which guide so much of our computer technology well beyond the barriers of normal human understanding, repeatedly bought and sold millions of shares. Companies like Radio Shack, American Airlines, Best Buy and Bank of America, all saw their trading volumes explode beyond all comprehension. Human comprehension, that is. Advanced technology strikes again.
The trading algorithms are designed to make money on tiny fractional moves of a stock, focusing smaller, and moving faster, than any human can imagine.
We live in a 21stC world, where few of us understand anymore how any of our machines work, or how to fix them when they break. Even the supposed experts often just throw the machine in the garbage and substitute it with a new one, freshly burst free from its shrink wrapping. The product cycles of our electronic machines are now so short that one cannot become attached to any generation because there is always a generation coming right behind which will be promised to be better and more advanced. Who wants to be left behind? Not us.
Computers came to Wall Street long ago already. With them came the ‘Quants,’ former math and physics grad students, who tired of academia, and wanted to drive Ferrari’s and Maserati’s just like some of their far less intellectually accomplished classmates were doing, who were working on Wall Street during the gravy years. Presto, high finance meets modern computing power.
Periodically, regulators and the public have questioned the fairness of having computers, programmed to trade stocks, bonds, derivatives and all manner of financial paper, trading in competition with humans. The average Day Trader sitting at his or her computer from early morning on, cannot read and absorb enough information to be able to act as fast as a computer programmed to execute lightning fast trades – it simply cannot be done.
What we now call the “Flash Crash” of 2010 (a/k/a “The Crash of 2:45”) happened on May 6, 2010. On that Thursday, all of a sudden, the Dow Jones Index crashed some 1,000 points (9% of it’s then value), only to recover minutes later, to the astonishment of human traders standing around, who could only scratch their heads in amazement. This was the second largest intra-day point swing, a 1,010.14 point plunge, and the biggest one-day point decline, 998.5 points, in the Dow Jones’ long and storied history. Trillions of dollars were lost. The SEC (and the CFTC, overseeing commodities trading) studied the problem, and jointly wrote a big report – Congress held hearings. The cause? Still a subject for robust debate, several theories, and much speculation, I am afraid.
The recent Wild Wednesday berserk computer trades went beyond anything seen in the 2010 Flash Crash. “The machines have taken over, right?” speculated Patrick Healy, the CEO of Issuer Advisory Group, a consulting firm.
The crazy, out of control trading seemed to center around one New Jersey stockbroker, who specializes in computer trading..
In case you have forgotten about the serious threats of cyber-warfare against a civilization which became utterly and completely dependent on computers within practically a single generation, you can bet that some hacker in North Korea, or Lord knows where else, has not forgotten. ‘Pull the thread, and watch the whole sweater unravel.’ That’s the risk.

A U.S. judge on Friday rejected a proposed $8.5 million class action settlement with Groupon Inc
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego found fault with a provision in the settlement that would have set aside $75,000 to be divided among two non-profit groups. The judge said neither of the organizations were "expressly committed to righting the specific wrongs alleged in this case."
While Sabraw denied other objections to the settlement by members of the class, he said he had to reject the entire settlement because he did not have the authority to strike just the charity provisions.
Representatives for Groupon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
John Stoia, a lawyer at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing plaintiffs who bought vouchers on Groupon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The decision marked the latest by a court to address so-called cy pres awards in class actions, in which money is dedicated to charity rather than distributed to the plaintiffs themselves. Cy pres comes from a French phrase meaning "as near as possible."
The charitable awards have become common when the amount of money recovered is small and the class itself is large, making distribution impractical.
The charities are typically intended to represent the interests of the classes of plaintiffs.
But in several instances, courts have rejected the settlements after finding the money dedicated to the cy pres award should go to the plaintiffs themselves, or are going to inappropriate charities.
Groupon agreed to the settlement in April as the Chicago-based company sought to put behind it lawsuits alleging that its vouchers violated federal and state laws applying to the expiration dates for gift certificates.
Among the laws Groupon allegedly violated was the federal Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act, which restricts the sale of gift certificates that expire in less than five years. Groupon denied the allegations.
Of the $8.5 million, $75,000 was set to go to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy and Technology, two organizations concerned with Internet rights.
But Sabraw said neither organization was focused on the core issue of the case -- expiration dates and other restrictions on consumer vouchers or misleading advertising related to vouchers.
"That consumers purchase vouchers on the Internet is not enough," he said. "Indeed, it is incidental to the claims at issue in this case."
Sabraw said he agreed with objectors who argued that the money should instead be distributed to the class itself.
Representatives for the non-profits did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The case is In re Groupon Marketing and Sales Practices Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, No. 11-md-02238.

ZURICH – Richemont on Friday named Cartier chief Bernard Fornas and deputy chief executive Richard Lepeu as joint CEOs to navigate the luxury goods group through a period of slowing sales growth in its important Asian markets.
They will take over from executive chairman Johann Rupert, who also held the role of CEO since 2010. He will step down from that role on April 1, 2013, but remain chairman, Richemont said.
The announcement came as the Geneva-based group reported a slowdown in sales growth to 7 percent at constant exchange rates in October from 12 percent in the first half.
The world's second largest luxury goods group after France's LVMH remained tight-lipped on its trading outlook, saying only that good growth in Europe supported by Asian tourists is compensating for slower domestic Asia Pacific sales.
"For the second half of the year, the comparatives are likely to be impacted by less favourable exchange rates," the group said.
Richemont said in a presentation overall growth in the Asia-Pacific region, which accounted for 41 percent of group sales in the first half, was "normalizing" after two exceptional years.
Growth in the region slid to 9 percent in the first half from 60 percent in the year-ago period.
"The slowdown to 7 percent in October appears reasonable enough - however, Asia Pacific and Americas appears to have declined at mid single-digit growth rates in October, which might raise eyebrows," Kepler Capital Markets analyst Jon Cox said.
"I think the slowdown is temporary and we certainly aren't seeing a repeat of 2007-8. Post elections in the U.S. and China, I suspect sentiment will improve," he said.
Strong sales growth between April and September helped net profit at the maker of Cartier watches and Montblanc pens soar 52 percent to 1.08 billion euros, beating a 1.04 billion forecast in a Reuters poll.

During Hanukkah, Jewish children often play a simple gambling game using a 4-sided top called a dreidel. Each face of the dreidel has a Hebrew letter, one of which is called nun.
The dreidel game is played for small tokens; often toothpicks, chocolate coins or M&M candies are used.
To begin the game, each player places a token in the central "pot," similar to an ante in poker. The players then take turns spinning the dreidel, and the result is determined by whichever letter is facing up when the dreidel comes to a rest.
- Nun: "Nothing" -- The player neither gives nor receives.
- Gimmel: "All" -- The player takes the entire pot.
- Heh: "Half" -- The player takes half the pot.
- Shin: "Put" -- The player adds to the pot.
When the pot is emptied, the players ante once again, and play resumes.
Hanukkah recalls the reign of the Greek king Antiochus IV, who repressed the Jews and forbade the study of the sacred Torah. According to the jewish101.com Web site, people who gathered for Torah study would use a gambling game as a cover story. That has come down through history in the form of the dreidel.
Under the leadership of Matthias and his son, Judah Maccabee, a Jewish Army (the Maccabees) rebelled against Antiochus and reclaimed the holy Temple. Ritual required that a lamp be kept burning in the temple all night, but there was enough pure oil for only one day. Yet the lamp was said to have burned for eight full days.
The letters on the dreidel recall the Hebrew phrase Nes Gadol Hayah Sham, which translates to "a great miracle happened there." The nightly lighting of the Hanukkah menorah also recalls the miracle. Even some of the foods traditionally eaten during the holiday recall the miracle of the oil. Jews often eat fried foods, and fried potato pancakes called latkes are a favorite.
You can play an interactive online version of the dreidel game at the jewish101 Web site.

DURHAM, N.C. –.
The 10thth-ranked Tigers (8-1, 5-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) had 718 yards — 379 through the air — during their 56-20 win at Duke on Saturday night. Boyd passed for five touchdowns to match the program record for the second straight game, while Hopkins had three TD catches to set a school record for most career touchdown catches.
That performance against Duke — Clemson had 28 points in the first quarter and 42 by halftime — was one reason Boyd sounded so pleased after the Tigers' fifth straight win.
. He had scoring catches of 5, 58 and 45 yards.
, had missed three games because of suspension and illness. He had his first touchdown catch last week at Wake Forest to go with a program-record 202 yards receiving, then had a 30-yard TD catch from Boyd in the final minute of the first quarter against the Blue Devils.
Hopkins had four catches for 128 yards, while Watkins had six catches for 97 yards.

Black Caviar set to bypass Newmarket Handicap and have Melbourne swansong in William Reid Stakes
- Herald Sun
- February 19, 2013
Going around again ... Black Caviar's next race will be the William Reid Stakes. Source:News Limited
Champion sprinter Black Caviar will not risk her unblemished career record by running in the Newmarket Handicap at Flemington on March 9.
Trainer Peter Moody declared on Tuesday morning that the mare, winner of 23 consecutive starts, instead will head to the weight-for-age William Reid Stakes at Moonee Valley on Friday, March 22 for her final race in Victoria.
Moody said the handicap conditions of the Group 1 Newmarket Handicap (1200m) was the decisive factor.
She would be handicapped at 61.5kg, meaning she would have to give massive weight advantages to rivals, including another of his gallopers, Moment Of Chance.
Moment Of Change ran second to Black Caviar down the Flemington straight last Saturday in the Group I Lightning Stakes (1000m) and will contest the Newmarket.
The champ would have to give the Group I winner 9kg in weight, a huge turnaround for the race.
"She'll head to the Reid under weight-for-age conditions," Moody said, saying he would not continue speculation about the Newmarket race.
Bookmakers and the TAB had Black Caviar the favourite for the race - with the caution that she was a doubtful starter - and punters who backed her would have lost their money as betting is "all-in".
Moody reported that Black Caviar, who broke Special's track record at Flemington last Saturday, pulled up extremely well and was in great condition.
Moody reported that Black Caviar, who broke Special's track record at Flemington last Saturday, pulled up extremely well and was in great condition.
The Reid Stakes event will be a huge bonus for Moonee Valley, which has been promoting the night as Victoria's farewell race in Victoria.
She then is likely to run in the TJ Smith Stakes in Sydney and the BTC Cup in Queensland - an identical campaign to last year before retirement to stud.
A second trip to the UK is unlikely..

Like Strauss-Kahn, Christine Lagarde Dragging Baggage Into Likely IMF Directorship
(Pictured: "Bilderbergers" building bridges.)
In the infamous column in which French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy cried his outrage at the public humiliation inflicted to Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the aftermath of his arrest, one sentence described particularly well the unspoken but unshakeable consensus governing politicians and the law in France. Levy expressed his indignation against: “The American judge who by delivering him to the crowd of photo hounds, pretended to take him for a subject of justice like any other.”
The idea that Strauss-Kahn should not be treated as “a subject of justice like any other” remained a leitmotiv through the flood of media reactions to his arrest in France. Because he had more to lose than “a vulgar delinquent” would have in a similar case, the argument went, because of his years of service to the world as head of the IMF and because of his prestige as future presidential candidate, he should be given special treatment. His disgrace should be hidden from public view; he should be spared the humiliation and disagreement of handcuffs, detention, and monitoring; and most importantly he should be given the benefit of the doubt.
This is nothing new in under the sun in French Politics. During his twelve years as President, Jacques Chirac was cited in nine different corruption cases while shielded both by presidential immunity and a merciful public opinion. One of his former Prime Ministers, Alain Juppé, was convicted of corruption in 2004, only to be recently welcomed back into Sarkozy's government in the key spot of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Other prominent members of the French government have been implicated in scandals in the past few years, from Minister of Budget Eric Woerth's shady dealings with L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt to former Minister of Interior Brice Hortefeux's conviction for racial slander. While these cases certainly sparked media scandals, Sarkozy maintained his public support to the indicted ministers -- perpetuating the tradition of that political figures benefiting from impunity, proportionally to their rank. The message is clear: you might have to lay low for a couple of years after the scandal but you will be protected, and eventually come back safely to the front rows of power.
Another such disreputable figure is Bernard Tapie, a Berlusconi-esque figure who has dabbled in murky-yet-profitable business ventures, show business, politics and soccer club management. He last hogged newspaper headlines in 2008, for receiving 403 million Euros of public funds in compensation for having been cheated fifteen years earlier by the French Bank Credit Lyonnais in the sale of the firm Adidas, which he headed at the time. In a time of economic downturn, public opinion was outraged that Tapie would received such a colossal sum, coming straight from their tax-Euros. But most importantly, the procedure through which the settlement was made was shady: three arbiters were picked to review the case and come to a decision behind closed doors a process contested at the time by several legal commentators, since public funds were involved.
Most critical to the affair is who took these questionable decisions and personally picked the arbiters: France's Minister of Economy and Finances, and now leading candidate to take Strauss-Kahn's spot as head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde. Lagarde could face prosecution for “abuse of authority” in this case, as the Cour de Justice de la Republique (CJR), in charge of judging crimes and offenses perpetrated by Ministers in office, is evaluating the case and deliberating on the need for further investigation. More severe than the dubious process chosen to settle the case is the fact, revealed by french independent news website Mediapart (), that Lagarde knew of a relationship between one of the arbiters and Tapie's attorney and chose not to interrupt the process or appeal its outcome.
In the mainstream media's coverage of Lagarde's candidacy, the case is usually referred to as a detail, almost a footnote. Lagarde herself dismisses these accusations as innocuous. “I am perfectly confident and serene regarding this subject and this has absolutely no bearing on my candidacy” she declared on June 10th, after her audience was pushed back to July. Once again, just as Strauss-Kahn's widely known compulsion toward sexual harassment never impeded his political ascendency, we are faced with an example in which a political leader is not held to the rule of law because of a “special treatment” granted by her position on the national and now global political chessboard. There is serious evidence that Christine Lagarde, in the cesspool of corruption that is France's political landscape turned a blind eye on another instance of cronyism. Should it be disregarded as Strauss-Kahn's history of sexual “misconduct” was four years ago?

Rogue trader Kerviel launches appeal
Société Générale rogue trader Jérôme Kerviel appealed his 2010 conviction in a Paris court on Monday, saying he was "not responsible" for the €5 billion in losses from risky trades that almost bankrupted one of France's biggest banks.
News Wires (text)
AFP - Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel argued Monday at the start of his appeal hearing that his ex-employer Societe Generale bank knew he was making the risky gambles that eventually cost it five billion euros.
"I am not responsible for this loss and the acts I am accused of. I always acted with the knowledge of my hierarchy," he told the judge when asked why he was appealing his 2010 conviction.
The 35-year-old Frenchman was originally sentenced to five years in jail with two years suspended for breach of trust, forgery and entering false data into computers during the 2008 covert stock market deals.
The original verdict also required him to pay back the staggering 4.9 billion euros ($6.0 billion) which his market gambles cost Societe Generale and which nearly ruined the bank.
Critics of that ruling said it made him a scapegoat for a banking system based on pure greed.
Kerviel, who wore a dark-blue suit and white shirt for his Paris court appearance on Monday, has consistently argued that his superiors knew what he was doing and turned a blind eye as long as he was making them a profit.
Rejecting charges that he acted alone, he has insisted the firm knew all about his $50 billion in trading positions, and even encouraged him to take risks.
Kerviel, who told the court he was currently unemployed and had no source of income, has admitted regularly exceeding trading limits and logging false transactions to cover his gambles, but says this was common practice.
Societe Generale management has argued it knew nothing of what Kerviel was up to.
Two months ago, Kerviel changed his lawyer, hiring David Koubbi, who has launched two countersuits against Societe Generale.
One accuses the bank of.
Societe Generale, which said in 2010 that it would spare Kerviel paying the full compensation, has hit back with two suits for malicious falsehood.
Since the Kerviel case exploded, banks have insisted that internal safeguards have been reinforced to prevent a repeat.
Societe Generale was fined four million euros at the time by the French banking commission for failing in its internal checks.
If his appeal fails, Kerviel faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
The appeal is set to last until June 28.

So you've seen the photos and thought to yourself, "How the heck did they do that?!?!" well, we are here to help
answer those questions with the FrankenFAQ. We hope that these nuggets of information help shed light on some of our creations.
FAQ #1
Q: What power does
it take to drive a disk can (cage) from a 6xx or 7xx machine so I can
hook it up to my 170?
A: The cage has a 9
pin connector on the back with one pin missing so you can't connect it
backwards. The pins need the following voltages applied:
+5V +12V G G G G Pin +12V +5V
We have found that a 250W PC Power supply can handle two cages along
with a couple fans to keep the cages cool. Be Careful to allow for the
fans to come off for drive maintenance. Also watch fan speed because
those that go like crazy get kinda noisy!
FAQ #2
Q: Can't I just
apply power to that 'PC Like' 4-pin molex power connector on the back
of the can?
A: No. That
connector is output power to drive a tape or CD Drive only. Applying
power to that connector doesn't do anything.
FAQ #3
Q: Some of my disk
cans have two SCSI ports. Which do I use?
A: On the top cages
in the 6xx and 7xx machines there is an input 68 SCSI connector
(female) and an output connector (male) The Male connector MUST have
an LVD terminator connected or bad things will happen. The lower cans
have no output connector and have termination build in.
FAQ #4
Q: Can't I hook
anything to the output connector of the disk can?
A: Yes you can. If
you want to add an LVD tape drive or CD Drive, connect it there with
an LVD SCSI terminator downstream of the drive. You MUST set the SCSI
address of the drive properly. It can be address 0 but CANNOT be
address 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. These addresses are the 5 drives, the
SCSI backplane in the CAN and the SCSI controller.
FAQ #5
Q: My 720 has two
disk cans on the left which are full of drives but I am told I cannot
add a third can to the left side of my 720 model. But there is one can
on the right with no drives in it. Can I use that can?
A: Yes you can!
While iSeries Navigator will get all confused about the physical
location of the drives in that can you can run the SCSI cable from
that can through the center of the cabinet and connect it to port
three on the SCSI card (i.e. 2741, 2748). It already has power
connected to it.
FAQ #6
Q: What is this
high speed low speed slot thing? They sure look the same to me. Is
this to keep me from overloading the IOP or is IBM just limiting the
capabilities of my server?
A: The low speed
slots are missing some pin signals that certain cards really do need.
The reason for this is the SPD heritage of the machines where slots
have this designation (i.e. 6xx, 7xx, 170 and 250 machines with PCI
slots) If you put a 2838 in a low speed slot for example it will show
up and appear to be happy. However try to vary on an Ethernet line
description that uses the card and it will fail miserably even if you
configure the line for 10Mb.
FAQ #7
Q: I want to add
some extra disk units to my 170 but I already have 10 of 'em in there.
I've looked at FAQ #1 but I don't want to add another power supply.
Can't I simply draw power from one of the extra connectors inside my
170?
A: Maybe. The left
side power supply runs memory and processor and such and while it may
have extra power I would avoid overly stressing that power supply. The
one on the right side is usually a bit larger so it is a candidate.
Now if you have an Integrated Netfinity Card on the right you won't
have the extra power available to keep everything going. Without an
INS card there is enough power there to run one extra disk can and a
cooling fan. Frankie ran that way for over a year until we added
another INS card. We couldn't get the INS card to vary on in this
configuration - it would fail completely at some point during the vary
on.
FAQ #8
Q: Where does
Frankenseries.com run?
A: We at
Frankenseries.com eat our own cooking. Our web site, email, ftp etc
all run on Frankie. When we're messing with him you'll get an 'Oops'
page.
FAQ #9
Q: Does IBM support
Frankenseries.com?
A: Are you nuts?
They know we exist and think we're cool. When we call with problems
they laugh a lot. We have broken so many rules that even the local CEs
stand well clear of our stuff.
FAQ #10
Q: There is a big
UPS in the bottom of my old 720 which is being retired. Can't I use
that as a stand alone UPS?
A: While it is
possible, so far Dr. Franken has not yet ascertained the pin signals
needed to get it to fire up. Remember that an important function of
these UPS was to supply DC voltage to keep main storage powered during
a power outage. In addition to that you are messing with 240 Volts 20
Amps of AC power and 48 Volts (and 100 Amps?) of batteries either one
of which could cause big problems (serious problems like burns and
DEATH!) if improperly handled. If you aren't qualified to deal with
this stuff, keep your hands off! Also Dr. Franken has blown one of
those UPSs to smithereens, every single one of the 20 Power MosFets
inside the UPS exploded within about 3 seconds. They are about as loud
as a starter pistol and they throw flames when they go!! Fortunately
they are inside a stout metal box. (Thank you IBM.) In another
experiment my trusty assistant iGor caused the transformer in that UPS
to roll smoke.
Hmmmm. Do not try this at home, we're what you call 'experts.'
FAQ #11
Q: If I have more
drives in my system than IBM allows how can I maintain them if one of
them would fail?
A: Well you won't
maintain those through the iSeries navigator GUI! IBM has built in a
table of drive locations and tower layouts. Any disk unit above the
limit for the system clearly won't have an entry in the table.
Fortunately in Service Tools the drive will have an address and a
device name such as DD035. Service tools will happily allow you to
replace a failed drive using that name and then rebuild it if it's
RAID or MIRRORed. The only thing you cannot do is add more drives in
MT slots. This is since the MT slots aren't supposed to exist, the
drives that aren't in them don't have a name. You will need to put the
drives in and IPL the system for them to be recognized.

You probably never even heard the name Costas Mandylor until the Saw films rolled around, but he's actually had a pretty storied Hollywood past and the Australian born actor has been in some major films and television shows that you've probably seen. To give a little pre-acting background, Mandylor played professional soccer for both Greece and Australia, before he suffered stress fractures to his shins. In 1987, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career and it took just two years before he landed his first major role. That role was alongside Willem Dafoe and Edward James Olmos in the 1989 Holocaust biopic Triumph of the Spirit.
The fresh faced Mandylor portayed the real life character of enslaved Jew Avram Arouch, brother to lead character Salamo Arouch (Dafoe), who got shipped off to Auschwitz and seperated from his just married wife during the Holocaust of World War 2. Rather impressively for a big screen debut, Mandylor has a heck of a lot of screen time during the early parts of the film and he's a pretty pivotal and important character throughout and he turns in one hell of a performance.
In an incredibly intense scene about an hour into the film, Avram refuses to work in the ovens pulling gold teeth from those who were gassed to death and he is shot dead right on the spot. The death scene takes place entirely off screen, but its impact is felt for the remainder of the film and marks a huge turning point for Dafoe's character.
From there, Mandylor went on to have a role in 1991's The Doors as well as roles in the television shows Tales From The Crypt, The Outer Limits, Picket Fences (he starred in every episode), and most recently 7th Heaven, which i'm somewhat ashamed to admit I remember him from. Most interesting of all, Mandylor was featured as one of People Magazine's prestigious 50 Most Beautiful People In The World of 1991!
From most beautiful to the star of one of the most violent and bloody franchises in horror, Costas Mandylor's career path is certaintly an interesting one and I for one am glad to have such a talented actor in the horror world! I definetly have more of an appreciation for him now that i'm aware of his acting roots.

So, the laptop does not seem to be accessing the network. We need to check if the wireless connection is, well, connecting. Let's answer a few questions: 1. The laptop uses 802.11g, right? 2. With the wireless connection on the laptop, there should be some sort of monitor on the bottom right for the wireless. If you hover over it or open it, somewhere on there should says CONNECTED or DISCONNECTED. Can you verify that it says CONNECTED? 3. Checking in the same spot as #3, if it says connected, it should tell you what SSID it is connected to. What is the SSID name given? 4. At this point, with the laptop, can you access the internet? 5. Using the laptop, can you access the router? How would you know. simple. open your web browser on the laptop (IE or any other) and see if you can access the router settings. If you can access the settings, then you're at least connecting to the router. If you cannot access the router settings, then you are not even connecting to the router. To access the router settings on a Linksys, you should type in the browser <> 6. Assuming you can access the router settings, look somewhere in there at one of the settings tab. I don't have a Linksys, so I am going off the top of my head here. But, it may be a tab called SETTINGS or STATUS or ADMIN. Point is, you are looking for a setting called SSID. When you find it, tell me what it is, and is it the same as the SSID the laptop is connecting to. 7. And, last important, are you using Cable or DSL?

Assuming that's correct, we can move to the next step. The desktop is XP Home. So, that's already set up as using 'simple file sharing', as that's the only way XP Home can be set.

Legendary hip-hop collective Wu-Tang links up with sports watch brand G-Shock for an exclusive watch to commemorate the Wu’s upcoming 20th anniversary. The two decided to go with G-Shock’s classic DW-6900 model, using the color scheme of black & yellow (Wu-Tang’s signature colors) for the overall colorway of the watch. The wrist piece features the iconic Wu-Tang Clan “W” logo on the upper dial and G-Shocks signature “G” button on the bottom, which lights up the whole bezel when pushed. This looks like a perfect tribute to one of the most dynamic groups in rap history.
No official release date has been set for the Wu-Tang x G-Shock DW-6900, but it is scheduled to be sold in North-America exclusively. Keep your eyes open for this one.--

For a long time, hibernation has been associated with proprietary operating systems. Now, the feature has started taking the front row in GNU/Linux systems too. What’s more, it’s fast, flexible and is a real time saver!
Introduction
Software hibernation or suspend-to-disk is a very productive operating system feature. It has many advantages over a cold system start or reboot. Not only does the hibernated system load up faster, the user also gets back to his previous session without much effort. This is important because of the time the user saves by avoiding the need to set up a work session again.
So, how is hibernation different? It is different because it saves the contents of the RAM (Random Access Memory) into some non-volatile storage medium before shutting down the system. Consequently, when the system boots up again, the operating system loads the suspended image from disk to get back to the previously stored session.
Software suspend, as hibernation is popularly known in Linux systems, has evolved a lot in present day kernels. It is constantly getting more and more stable and useful. Some implementations are available in the kernel while one is available as a patch that can be applied to the 2.4 or the 2.6 series. This article is meant to introduce you to the implementations available and the features that they provide.
Not only does the hibernated system load up faster, the user also gets back to his previous session without much effort
History and available methods in Linux
The history of software suspend in Linux can be traced to Gabor Kuti and Pavel Machek who developed a patch for the 2.2 series known as
swsusp. It was probably an abbreviation for swap suspend as the snapshot image was written to the active swap partition of the system. Gabor used to maintain these patches on his personal page. The code base for this patch became the basis for three different implementations that we have today:
swsusp,
suspend2 and
uswsusp.
swsusp was first incorporated in the 2.5.18 kernel. It subsequently became a part of the 2.6 stable release. Later, a fork of
swsusp, known as
pmdisk evolved. The difference between
swsusp and
pmdisk was that the latter’s code was much cleaner and well structured. Moreover, while
swsusp used the
/proc interface,
pmdisk used the
/sys interface.
pmdisk cleanups were eventually merged into the
swsusp code base.
Among all the available methods, the one that generates the maximum excitement is
suspend2 by Nigel Cunningham. It introduces some important changes in the way the snapshot image is handled and is also noticeably faster.
suspend2 is currently available as a patch for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels and will hopefully be merged into the mainline kernels in future.
Also worth mentioning is
uswsusp, abbreviation for
userland-swsusp. It is an implementation of an interface for software suspend in the user space. All kernels starting from 2.6.17 have
uswsusp merged in them. The module gives access to software suspend functionalities by exposing common file operation methods that can be used to operate on a character device. This is only useful for developers who would like to write their
software suspend applications in user space and hence I won’t delve into this topic in detail here.
swsusp
How swsusp works
swsusp works by taking a snapshot of the contents of the RAM. This snapshot or suspend image is copied and then saved in an atomic operation fashion to the active swap partition. Upon rebooting, if a valid image signature is found on the active swap, the image is loaded and the snapshot transferred back to memory. This gets back the saved state to the user. The following illustration shows the sequence in simple terms:
- User requests for software suspend
- All the running processes are given the
suspendsignal
- The devices are frozen so that they don’t change the system state when the snapshot is taken
- The memory image is atomically copied with interrupts disabled
- Frozen devices are awakened so that the image can be written
- The image is written to swap
- Devices are suspended and the system powered off
The resume process involves just the inverse of the above steps.
Configuration and running
Configuring and running
swsusp is a breeze since it is a part of the 2.6 vanilla kernel. If
swsusp has not been compiled in your running kernel, you will have to enable it and recompile your kernel. It is always a good idea to compile a fresh stable version instead of tinkering with the running version because that way you always have a backup with you.
To enable
swsusp, bring up the kernel configuration window:
$cd /your/linuxsourcedir $make xconfig
Enable Software Suspend under Power Management Options as shown in figure 1.
You can optionally add your swap partition path in Default resume partition. This step appends a
resume parameter to the kernel section in grub.conf. You may also enable Encrypt suspend image that would encrypt the image stored in the swap partition. The key that is used for encryption is stored temporarily and deleted after resuming.
swsusp will not work with Symmetric Multi Processing (SMP) enabled in your kernel. So, you will have to disable Symmetric Multi Processing_support under _Processor types and features to enable the
swsusp module as shown in figure 2.
As
swsusp uses the AES module to encrypt the suspend image, you will have to select Cryptographic API and AES cipher algorithms as built-ins into the kernel (not as modules as they won’t be loaded). Refer to figure 3.
`swsusp` will not work with Symmetric Multi Processing (SMP) enabled in your kernel
Now compile your kernel and if the compilation succeeds, install your kernel.
$make $make modules_install $make install
You should also check whether a resume parameter has been appended to the newly installed kernel’s entry in grub.conf. If not, you can add it manually as resume=/your/swappartition. (Refer to figure 4)
The default location of grub.conf is /etc. It may be different for your system. Finally, to hibernate, type the following command :
$echo platform > /sys/power/disk; echo disk > /sys/power/state
If everything is fine, your system should enter the hibernate process and after saving the image should power off. You should again restart your system to find out if it really worked. The boot sequence should load the suspended image and get back to your previous session.
There are a few other important points worth mentioning:
- To limit the suspend image size to N bytes, type:
$echo N > /sys/power/image_size
where N is the number in bytes.
- Instead of using
echo platform, you may use
echo shutdownto hibernate your system. (Refer to the command above)
- If the system becomes too slow after a resume, you may try turning off the swap and then turning it on again:
$swapoff -a $swapon -a
- You may try a SysVInit patch that would enable you to suspend using:
$shutdown -z now
The patch is available here
- Append the
noresumeparameter to your kernel if you would like to boot normally but be warned that something might go wrong!
suspend2
How suspend2 works
The fundamentals behind the working of
swsusp and
suspend2 are almost the same. However, there are some major differences in the way
suspend2 does things and the flexibility it provides to the user.
suspend2 first saves the lru (least recently used) pages in memory to the disk backstore, then does an atomic copy of the rest of the memory and then saves that. Since it is not doing an atomic copy of the whole of the memory, the process becomes much faster than
swsusp and the image size is not limited to just half of the memory. The module sees to it that once we start saving the page lists, no pages are added or deleted, hence maintaining the integrity of the saved data. To summarize the steps:
- User requests for system hibernation
suspend2waits for the number of processes in their critical paths to reach zero
- New processes are prevented from entering states that can cause deadlocks or inconsistent states
- The page cache is saved to disk
- Drivers are suspended and the processor state is saved
- The rest of the memory is atomically copied and then saved to disk
- The system is shut down
The resume process is just the opposite of the above steps.
Configuration and running
To enable
suspend2, you will have to patch and compile your kernel. Patches for many versions are available on the
suspend2 downloads page. However the stable version is suspend-2.2.5 for 2.6.16.9 kernel. Using the stable release reduces the chances of breaking the kernel compilation. First of all, you need to apply the
suspend2 patches using the apply script supplied.
$tar -jxvf linux-2.6.16.9.tar.bz2 $tar -jxvf suspend2-2.2.5-for-kernel-2.6.16.9.tar.bz2 $cd linux-2.6.16.9 $../suspend2-2.2.5-for-kernel-2.6.16.9/apply
If you have other patches on your kernel (such as the mm patch), chances are that the apply script will fail. In that case, patching the files individually would be a good idea. The patch file that refuses has to be manually applied by looking through the diff file and replacing code at the right places. After patching, you will have to configure your kernel. As shown in figure 5, enable Suspend2 under Power Management Options. From the options that show up in the Option window, enable File Writer and Swap Writer. You may ignore the rest of the options but feel free to go through their descriptions.
By default,
suspend2 uses the LFZ modules for compression and encryption which may be built into the kernel by selecting Cryptographic API and LFZ compression algorithm under Cryptographic Options.
Once you are done selecting all other modules relevant to your system, compile your new kernel and install it.
suspend2 gives you the flexibility to choose the location to save the suspend image. You can either choose the file writer or the swap writer for this purpose. While the filewriter can save the image to a normal file, the swap writer can save the image either to a swap partition or to a swap file. Unlike
swsusp,
suspend2 can write to any swap partition! It need not be the system’s active swap partition. I’ll cover the above three steps one by one.
Unlike swsusp, suspend2 can write to any swap partition! It need not be the system’s active swap partition
- Writing to a normal file: First of all create a file that is at least equal in size to your system RAM. Here, I create a 512 MB file called suspend-image.
$dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=512 >> suspend-image
Next supply this file to the
suspend2 filewriter target.
$echo suspend-image > /proc/suspend2/filewriter_target
Finally, you will have to get the actual physical offset of this file and append it to the kernel section in grub’s configuration file (grub.conf).
$cat /proc/suspend2/resume2
The above command gave me the following output:
file:/dev/hda5:0x3c000
So I need to append resume2=file:/dev/hda5:0x3c000 in my grub.conf. (Refer figure 7). Don’t just copy-paste the above output as it will definitely be different for your system.
- Writing to a swap partition: This is the easiest of them all and is recommended for first timers. You just need to append your swap partition path to the
resume2parameter for your kernel. Find out your swap partition:
$/sbin/fdisk -l | grep "swap"
and edit grub.conf accordingly. (Refer to figure 8)
- Writing to a swap file: The steps to this are similar to writing to a normal file except that here, you create a swap file instead of a normal one. To summarize:
$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=512 >> swap-suspend-image $ /sbin/mkswap swap-suspend-image 512 $ sync $ swapon swap-suspend-image
The output of the following command tells you what to append to the
resume2 parameter.
$cat /proc/suspend2/headerlocations
The following output was obtained:
For swap partitions, simply use the format: resume2=swap:/dev/hda1. For swapfile `/home/bandan/PTPRO/FSM/swap-su`, use resume2=swap:/dev/hda2:0x1d92678
The second output is what you would append in
grub.conf.
After choosing from the filewriter and the swapwriter (a combination of both is also possible), you should take a look at the
hibernate script. This is a shell script that greatly simplifies the hibernation sequence. Get the latest version from the
suspend2 Downloads page.The script is available as RPM, SRPM, deb or tar.gz. Choose one of them and install it. By default, it should install in
/usr/local/sbin.
If you use initrd (common in redhat distributions), you need to tell it about suspend2. Open the mkinitrd script in a file editor and go below the line that says:
echo "echo Mounted /proc filesystem" >> $RCFILE
Add the following:
echo "echo > /proc/suspend2/do_resume" >> $RCFILE
The default location of
mkinitrd is
/sbin.
The advantage of suspend2 lies in the flexibility it offers. A set of configuration files are provided by default in
/etc/hibernate. Hopefully, suspend2 will work “out of the box” but it is always a good idea to go through these configuration files if you want to tweak suspend2 to get the best out of it.
Here is a brief summary of all the configuration files suspend2 offers. The verbose commented sections give a detailed explanation of all the available options.
blacklisted-modules: Lists all the modules that have been reported to cause problems while suspending or resuming.
hibernate.conf: The file actually read when the hibernate script is executed.
disk.conf: Used when using the hibernate script to suspend using swsusp.
common.conf: Includes list of common configurable options.
ram.conf: Used when suspending to RAM instead of disk. (useful for laptops)
suspend2.conf: Configurable options for suspending to disk with suspend2.
Now all you have left to do is reboot into your new kernel. Keep a close eye on the system output while booting up. You should see something like
Suspend2 enabled. Finally to hibernate, simply type the following as root:
$/usr/local/sbin/hibernate
The system should enter the hibernate sequence and shutdown. Reboot again to check everything is fine.
If you are having problems with the filewriter, you may switch to the swap writer instead. It is usually convenient to try suspending to the swap partition first because that’s the easiest. Then, you may try suspending to a normal file or a swap file. If the
hibernate script doesn’t work for you for any reason, you should try the following:
$/usr/local/sbin/hibernate --bug-report > suspend-debug
Go through the contents of suspend-debug and see what went wrong. The most important information will be towards the end of the file. If you find its contents meaningless, you would be better off sending it to the suspend2 mailing list. Most probably, someone will help you out.
Eye candy
Not only does
suspend2 work differently, you can also make it look different. You have the option of a text based user interface or a graphical interface to show during the
hibernate sequence. Download and install the Suspend2-User-UI package from suspend2 website. Additionally, obtain a theme from here and extract it to
/etc/splash. Create a symbolic link to it and name it as suspend2.
$ mkdir /etc/splash (in case it does not exist) $ cd /etc/splash && tar -zxf theme.tar.gz $ ln -s theme/ suspend2
Add the appropriate entry in
suspend2.conf depending on what user interface you would like to have.
For text UI
ProcSetting userui_program /usr/local/sbin/suspend2ui_text
For Graphical UI
ProcSetting userui_program /usr/local/sbin/suspend2ui_fbsplash
Now hibernate and see if everything goes as expected. If not, you can use the
--bug-report option with hibernate to diagnose the problem.
hibernate’s log file also provides a lot of information about what went wrong. Its default location is
/var/log/hibernate.log.
Some tips and tricks
- Using the power button to suspend: First of all, make sure you have compiled your kernel with acpi support. Then install acpid and add it to the default run level.
$ rc-update add acpid default
Edit
/etc/acpi/default.sh as follows:
#!/bin/sh # Default acpi script that takes an entry for all actions set $* group=${1/\/*/} action=${1/*\//} case "$group" in button) case "$action" in power) /usr/sbin/hibernate & ;; *) logger "ACPI action $action is not defined" ;; esac ;; *) logger "ACPI group $group / action $action is not defined" ;; esac
- If you would like to reboot instead of shutting down your system, simply press “R” during the suspend process.
Conclusion
suspend2 clearly seems to be the successor to
swsusp. It provides a lot more features than any other available method and is also very configurable. It allows you to store the suspended image almost anywhere. A more interesting feature which is in the TODO list is suspending to a NFS share! However, kerneltrap reports Nigel as saying that he will devote less time to
suspend2 which may prevent its merging into the vanilla kernel.
The three different methods available target three different types of users. If you just want your system to hibernate and have no desire to tinker with your kernel,
swsusp is definitely for you. On the contrary,
suspend2 gives you greater speed and flexibility. If you are one of those who fancies writing his own userspace program, go for
uswsusp. Get set and take your pick!
Distros that already come with Hibernate
I just wanted to mention that for many users, Hibernate on GNU/Linux can be even easier. (Especially of interest to those who consider switching from Windows or the Mac and might be scared off by lengthy walkthroughs like this.)
gNewSense () and Ubuntu () both come with Hibernate already configured. So, for the user it's just a matter of clicking "Shut Down" -> "Hibernate". (I'm sure there are others too, but these are the ones I know.)
Distros that already come with Hibernate
Debian Etch (Testing still) also has the hibernate built in. It worked out of the box for me on my Thinkpad (R51)
Distro's that come with Hibernate
openSUSE 10.2 has it enabled by default too (I haven't tried it yet though), what I don't understand is this:
swsusp will not work with Symmetric Multi Processing (SMP) enabled in your kernel
But openSUSE has 2.6.18 with SMP as default kernel
Mac Suspend Techniques
I hear the mack is always updating changes in ram to the hybernation partition so that when a hybernation action is called for there is less writing necessary. I'd really like to see this functionality brought to Linux.
-Joe Baker
Distros that already come with Hibernate
Tried nearly all recent versions of Ubuntu to try out the Hibernate feature..works like crap.
Went back to Windows just bcoz I wanted this feature rather than waiting for Ok, Linux booting now.
thanks
thanks
It was raining heavily with
It was raining heavily with lightning while my lengthy fortran code had been running on my dekstop pc for about a day, I simply hybernated Ubuntu and once the rain stopped I was able to continue from where it's left, This is a very useful feature which really worked and helped me,
I'm wondering what'll happen if I unplug the computer after hybernating, I'll see if writes the current state to the RAM or to the Harddisk. I'm assuming the latter is true.
Wanted to say thank you!
I know this probably wasn't the most up to date article on Linux hibernation, but it worked perfectly for me.
Followed the swsup method. I'm running SW 12.1 on a Toshiba Satellite MX40 series. Worked like a charm.

Thank you to FreeSpirit Fabrics for asking me to be a guest blogger. I am so excited to tell you about my newest book for Creative Publishing International – Precut Patchwork Party. As the tag line says on the cover of the book, it’s full of “modern projects to sew and craft with fabric strips, squares and fat quarters”.
I have been a huge fan of FreeSpirit precut fabric bundles for a long time . I often pick them up with absolutely no idea of how I will use them. The colors and patterns just look so pretty all together in a bundle.
There are lots of patterns and ideas available for using precuts charm squares, strips and fat quarters to make quilts. But I wanted to design a collection of projects for this book that were everything but quilts. So Precut Patchwork Party will show you how to make a variety of home dec projects, as well as wearables, accessories and gift items. I’ve included lots of basic sewing information, tips of working with precut fabrics and several of my favorite sewing techniques like fabric rick-rack and rosettes that can be made from folded precut strips.Here is one of my favorite projects from the book:
Tisket Tasket Fabric Basket (Insert photo of baskets.)
Fabric strips from Kathy Davis’ Blossoming collection are used to make these woven fabric baskets. Make a few to organize your spools of thread and notions in your sewing room or use one to hold a casserole dish (and sew a coordinating lined napkin with a couple of fat quarters).
The projects in this book are perfect for a new sewist as well as someone who has been sewing for awhile. They all are constructed with very basic sewing techniques. Anyone who makes quilts and wants to do something new with their stash of precuts will find inspiration. So next time you can’t resist buying those beautiful bundles at the quilt store, know that there is a lot you can make with them, other than your beautiful quilts.

I am fascinated with those pretty baskets! Pre-cuts are a 'go-to' with a few staple patterns for a quickly needed quilt - time savers as well as you get to taste all the fabrics of a line.
I love precuts because the hardest part - making sure my cutting is true - is done for me :-) i hate when I've fdone my cutting and realise that I've cut things an inch to short or have done a wonky line.
E
I love sewing with precuts as I don't have to worry about coordinating the fabrics as I know everything will look good together. I also like the fact that they make the project faster to make.
I love precuts - they make making this so much faster, since you spend hardly any time cutting! I would love to make some not-quilty patchwork things for our house!
I love precuts because you get the whole fabric range in itty bitty squares, I like making wall hangings and I've just made a bag with a charm pack :)
I love sewing with precuts because cutting is my least favorite part of the process! I also love that you can get a little bit of every fabric without going broke :)
I love precuts! Obviously, I love not having to cut the fabric, but I also love that I can have the whole fabric collection in one bundle. Love them!
Sewing with precuts saves time and I am able to get a substantial variety of fabrics for my quilting projects without aggravating my LQS staff by asking them to cut small amounts of a whole line of fabrics.
I love precuts because of the accuracy of the cuts - no slipping of rulers, no being off just a hair - precision.
Pre-cuts save so much time and I agree FQ bundles are the best, enough fabric to make something wonderful and all matching fabrics. Thanks.
Precuts avoid some of the tedium of cutting and you get results fast!
I love precuts because they take the guess work out of what goes with what for me and then is already cut so I won't have slip-ps on my cutting. Thanks.
I love that those precuts can sit there quietly on my shelf, and then just come to my rescue when I need a quick project.
Cutting into fabric and getting absolutely straight and square cuts is still a bit intimidating to me, so buying precuts are a great way for me to just jump right in which makes the entire process FUN!
I love to sew with precuts because I don't have to wash them before sewing and I get a coordinated look without effort.
Precuts are great! The hard part of cutting is already done for you, and the fabrics all coordinate. Thanks for the givewaway.
Pre-cuts are so fun because I get some of each fabric in the line. They are easy to put together to make the many beautiful patterns availble using pre-cuts.
I am just beginning to work with some precuts - this book would be great - love the little baskets and napkins!
I am just beginning to work with precuts - would love the book! the basket and napkin are too cute
Having a little bit of this and that in my fabric collection, I've grown to love precuts. They give you new colors and designs to add to my less-than-up-to-date fabric. Though sometimes I love a line so much I design a project around the precut. Great way to buy just a bit of fabric!
I love precuts because at least half my cutting time has already been done for me. Plus I can get the scrappy look I love quickly & easily. Thanks.
I have not been quilting for a long time so I would love to try working with precuts! love the little baskets!
I love precuts because it makes it faster to make a quilt with the strips already cut and they are straight. I love the colors so coordinated
I LOVE precuts! All the tedious work of measuring and cutting has been done for you and you can get right to the fun part of sewing! I also love that everything is color/pattern coordinated. It really makes sewing and quilting and creating more fun!
I love the precuts because they cut the time it takes me to select fabrics as well as the cutting. They are great for quick and easy projects and they always look great because the colors are so coordinated. I love those baskets! Thanks for a chance to win a copy of the book.
Those little baskets are super cute.Precuts save time and the best is that you don´t need to coordinate,all match very well.
What a wonderful preview, baskets, and book. I would love some precuts and the book to try something new. Thanks for the opportunity.
I really haven't used precuts that much because I always cut my fabric to size. Using pre-cuts would make my life a lot easier and these projects are great.
what a delightful project! and i can imagine that the rest are just as wonderful. this would be great to have and the baskets would so much fun for my girls :)
this looks like so much fun - my girls would love these and i would love to see the rest of the book!
I love precuts since they take the prep work out of projects. I can usually open them and get started pretty quickly.
I love the simplicity of precuts. I can start with a charm pack and have a project going pretty quickly without too much prep work.
I usually can't wait to start a new project and to save time on the cutting part makes it even better. And matching colors is always right!
I love to sew with precuts because they are already cut and because you can get a great variety of prints without spending a ton of money!!
I love that precuts include every print from one collection! I also use them when I want just a little fabric, from a line I really like, to make something small and beautiful!
Love them
I would really love to try precuts. I'm very left brain and have a difficult time pulling things together. It would be a great help to have all the fabrics matched up for me ahead of time. Thanks much.
I LOVE the baskets and how easy with the precuts! Especially when you live an hour away from a fabric store!
Can't wait to tackle those super cute baskets for my sewing room!! Love! What other goodies are in your book?
Can't wait to make those super cute baskets for my sewing room! Love..love..love! What other fun projects are in the book?
Awesome giveaway! I can't wait to do my first precut jelly roll race.
Love using precuts in my projects. I am able to get the whole line for a reasonable cost and can quickly get to work because they are, well, pre-cut.
I love using precuts when I'm making quilts as gifts--it comes together so quickly! christina112358 at gmail dot com
Right now I'm dealing with both space and time constraints. Pre-cuts are the answer. I don't need a huge cutting area, so I can cut what is needed in the available space. And since I only spend a fraction of the time cutting, I can spend most of my time sewing. I really appreciate that.
I would like to see these projects especially to woven baskets that can be used for hot foods and be made to fit special dishes.
I love to sew with precuts because my cutting is not as perfect as it should be and because of that cutting is the part I enjoy less. Thanks for the chance!
ap_lemos at yahoo dot com
I like precuts, because it is one less thing for me to do wrong! The number of times I have cut something too short or too narrow because I'm not concentrating enough, well, lets just say you'd think I'd learn to pay more attention! Often I like everything in a fabric collection too, so I can have a little bit of everything with precuts :)
I love having a bit of each piece of a line. This book looks like fun.
Sewing with precuts puts you ahead. The cutting is (mostly) done for you.
This looks like a fun book! Pre-cuts just save so much time - they're brilliant!
Precuts are handy, ready to be used, save time and fabrics are coordinated beautifully.
I like to get the variety that pre-cuts offer for a project!
I love precuts! so easy to use and you get a sample of each fabric
I'm new to quilting and choosing right colours is difficult so the pre-cuts save me a lot of work and worry. And also they are always perfectly cut.
Less cutting, can use all the fabric in collection and not go broke and they are fun!!!!
Like you said in the post, cutting is my least favorite part of sewing. Plus, I'm terrible at coordinating fabric, so the bundles make that so much easier!
I love sewing with precuts because as a new quilter most of the hard work is done for me.... accurate cuts, colors coordinated, and straight seams. I also like that you get to see a whole collection of beautiful fabric. The projects in this book would be great for those single precut packs that aren't enough to make a whole quilt with. Thank you!
I love per cuts for numerous reasons. No standing in line to have fabric cut, wonderful bits of fun..... Elaine your book gives me more reasons to buy fabric precursor. Thanks
I like precuts as they all work together and you get a bit of a whole range rather than having to decide on just a few!
I love pre-cuts because they coordinate and I don't have to try and select just a few from the range!
I love pre-cuts because you they all work together and I don't have to try and select just a few from the range.

Leaseback - Introduction
"Leaseback" is an extremely popular option for investing in France, from studio apartments in coastal or ski resorts, through to luxury chateau and golf developments. Leaseback property or "Residence de Tourisme" was introduced in France over 20 years ago as a way of creating quality tourist accommodation for the world’s most popular tourist destination. Some 20 years on and France remains the world’s top tourist destination and the number of French and growing overseas investors that have benefitted from the Leaseback scheme has had a significant impact both on individual’s wealth creation and the tourism sector.
The Leaseback scheme allows investors to cover the major part of their mortgage repayments thanks to the rental income they receive and to benefit from a regular and secure source of supplementary income.

Does anyone have an idea to spruce up my kitchen? I have a typical 1980s kitchen with the beige formica cabinets that go all the way to the 7 ft ceiling in my VERY small kitchen. It is a galley kitchen and the plain, drab beige is really getting to me, but I don't have any ideas or knowledge of how to redo the formica cabinets. I am on a fixed income and although the cabinets are in good shape, their dullness is depreswsing. Does anyone know the secret of how to paint these if, indeed, that is my only option?

Fresh Selects: Joi – Sunshine and the Rain mp3
My old high school friend DJ AppleJac introduced me to a girl named Keya. I ran my magic and in no time we were on our way to a beautiful relationship. one of the things that i rememeber the most about that time period, was that key put me on to soooo much music…Omar, Jamiroquai, Meshell Ndegeocello, Vanessa Paradis the list goes on. One night while being schooled she dropped song that blew me a way. The song was loaded with heavy jeep bass that knocked like “Hold On” by EnVogue, but way harder. I didnt even have to ask who or what it was ringing out the speakers as she handed me the jewel case. The song was called “Sunshine and the Rain”, from a cd called The Pendulum Vibe. The artist was the same slim slender that lit up the hallways of my youth, my friend’s sister’s best friend JOI.
Now…
Since then I’ve JOI flossing billboards and posing slim and sexy in mega money print campaigns. I’ve been to many of her shows, and watched as her forward thinking style and attitude shed its influence on Atlanta and beyond. When i started dj’ing I searched high and low for a 12 inch copy of “Sunshine and the Rain”. It’s a timeless futuristic classic that always stays handy incase i have to rock vinyl.
Now rest assured that JOI is still that forward thinking sexy slim. This is very evident in her latest project Hot Heavy & Bad. Hot Heavy & Bad = JOI and Pal’s Lounge owner and original Proton memeber, Devon Lee. The video for their first single, “ONE” was directed by my old muchacho and Yin Yang Alumni Dashon.Is. A freshly serious piece of work that I’m not even going get started on cause it would take up too much time. I’ll let the Creative Loafing and the interwebs take it from here… Required reading: Creative Loafing. Be sure to follow Hot, Heavy & Bad.

Is it a camera? Not quite. But Polaroid‘s new SC1630 isn’t really a smartphone either. Hence the creative designation of “smart camera”. With a 16-megapixel camera plus a 3X optical zoom lens housed in a nifty, leather bound case, the Polaroid SC1630 Smart Camera is capable of recording High Definition videos and ultra sharp still images. On the device’s back is a 3.2-inch touchscreen LCD display. It doubles as a Smartphone and controls to the camera. Thanks to its Wi-Fi and cellphone capabilities, images and videos can be geo-tagged, edit, and upload to the social network of you choice. Though competitors like Samsung, LG, Sony Ericsson, and Sharp all have peddled similar two-in-one devices in the past. This debut design from Polaroid shows the revamped label is thinking outside of the box. Currently on display at CES in Las Vegas, the Polaroid SC1630 Smart Camera will be available sometime this year with price yet to be determined.

The median overall survival was 25.1 months with FASLODEX 500 mg and 22.8 months with 250 mg. The updated OS analysis, conducted at a minimum follow up of 50 months and 75% maturity, showed a 19% relative reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.96). No adjustments were made for multiplicity, therefore these data cannot be considered statistically significant. The KM estimate showed a sustained separation of the curves and a median survival of 26.4 months vs 22.3 months for the 500 mg and 250 mg doses, respectively.3
About Metastatic Breast Cancer
Metastatic breast cancer occurs when cancer cells spread beyond the initial tumor site to other parts of the breast or body; it is the most advanced stage of breast cancer (stage four).5,6 Metastatic breast cancer may be diagnosed as an initial diagnosis, as a distant recurrence after treatment of early breast cancer, or as a progression of earlier stage disease.7,8 There is no cure for metastatic breast cancer; the goal of treatment is to delay the progression of the cancer).

HOUSTON -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is the United States government’s principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services. As such, its mandate is one of the most extensive in the federal government – a real acid test for any software company’s products.
DHHS decided that the agency needed an IT service management solution that could provide consistent service to its IT-savvy internal customers. This would improve internal performance, and ultimately result in better service.
“When we can find ways to improve processes or make ourselves more efficient, it benefits not just our agency team but the taxpayers at large,” said Wallace Wilhoite, who leads the DHHS digital forensics team.
After a major evaluation, the agency selected BMC Remedyforce Service Desk from BMC Software (NASDAQ: BMC) because the solution best delivered the improved responsiveness and quick ROI that the agency was looking for. BMC’s in-depth understanding of federal security requirements and its active involvement in the FedRAMP program for cloud security were also important factors in the decision, as was the company’s strong support of the IT Infrastructure Library® (ITIL®) standards.
“With BMC Software, the agency’s return on investment was nearly immediate,” said Wilhoite. “In addition, BMC has been actively involved in FedRAMP compliance, which is what all Federal agencies are watching right now. They have essentially committed to making sure that they adhere to those security requirements and deliver us a secure solution.”
The Challenge
DHHS wanted to replace its slow, inconsistent ITSM processes – such as a paper-based IT service management process – with a solution that could consistently meet the demands of its IT-savvy internal customers. The agency also needed to meet government-mandated security requirements such as FedRAMP.
The Solution
The agency chose the BMC Remedyforce Service Desk solution to meet these goals with a cloud-based approach.
Benefits
By implementing the BMC Remedyforce Service Desk solution, DHHS has experienced a number of benefits, including:

USC §119(e) of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/582,357 filed Jun. 23, 2004.
Two copies of the sequence listing (Copy 1 and Copy 2) and a computer readable form (CRF) of the sequence listing, all on CD-ROMs, each containing the file named SEQUENCE_LISTING.txt, which is approximately 901,120 Bytes (measured in MS-WINDOWS), are herein incorporated by reference.
The invention relates generally to plant molecular biology and more particularly to the expression of isopentenyl transferase genes in plants under the control of cell cycle promoters that function in plants.
One of the goals of plant genetic engineering is to produce plants with agronomically important characteristics or traits. Recent advances in genetic engineering have provided the requisite tools to transform plants to contain and express foreign genes. Particularly desirable traits or qualities of interest for plant genetic engineering include but are not limited to resistance to insects and other pests and disease-causing agents, tolerances to herbicides, enhanced stability, yield, yield stability, shelf-life, environmental tolerances, and nutritional enhancements. The technological advances in plant transformation and regeneration have enabled researchers to take pieces of DNA, such as a gene or genes from a heterologous source, or a native source, and incorporate the exogenous DNA into the plant\'s genome. The gene or gene(s) can then be expressed in the plant cell to exhibit the added characteristic(s) or trait(s). In one approach, expression of a novel gene that is not normally expressed in a particular plant or plant tissue confers a desired phenotypic effect(s).
Plant growth and development is controlled by a diverse array of phytohormones in response to endogenous signals and environmental cues. These molecules include auxins, gibberellins, ethylene, cytokinins, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, oligosaccharides, jasmonates, salicylic acid, and polyamines. In recent years, the large-scale sequencing of plant genomes, together with extensive molecular, genetic and biochemical studies, has led to the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways for cytokinin biosynthesis. This in turn has allowed for new approaches to crop improvement by manipulating the expression of genes regulating the plant hormone biosynthesis through novel combination of gene expression elements and structural genes. Prior work has shown through both forward and reverse genetic analyses that plant hormonal regulation is highly complex. This has made it difficult to develop transgenic plants with improved agronomic traits but without deleterious pleiotropic effects.
Isopentenyl transferase (IPT) is a gene that was first isolated from Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA. It was shown that expression of IPT in transgenic plants resulted in elevated cytokinin accumulation, which was accompanied by morphological alterations of transgenic plants. Expression of IPT in an entire plant has phenotypes that are not advantageous, causing dwarfing, reduced leaf area, and thicker stems (Hlinkova, E., et al., Biologia Plantarum, Vol. 41: 25-37, 1998). Expression in entire plants also leads to stunting, loss of apical dominance, reduction in root initiation and growth, either acceleration or prolonged delayed senescence in leaves (depending on growth conditions), adventitious shoot formation from unwounded leaf veins and petioles, altered nutrient distribution, and abnormal tissue development in stems (Li, et al., Dev Biol 153: 386-395, 1992). When IPT is constitutively expressed at high level through either the CaMV 35S promoter or the native IPT promoter, the transgenic plants would develop severely retarded shooty morphology and would fail to root (Klee et al., Ann Rev Plant Phys 38:467-486, 1987). Whole plants transformed with IPT genes with weaker or controlled expression, such as the promoter of heat shock protein genes, also display the effects of cytokinin overproduction, such as uncontrolled axillary bud growth as a result of the loss of apical dominance, the development of small, rounded or curling leaves, and the retardation of root formation (Medford et al., Plant Cell 1:403-413, 1989; Schmulling et al., FEBS Letters 249:401-406, 1989; Smigocki, PNAS 85: 5131-5135, 1991; Hewelt et al., Plant J 6: 879-891, 1994; Smart et al., Plant Cell 647-656, 1991; Van Loven et al., J Exp Bot 44: 1671-1678, 1993; Faiss et al., Plant J 12: 401-425, 1997). It was also shown that low level of constitutive IPT expression, such as that directed by a heat shock promoter under non-inductive conditions, would be sufficient to induce abnormal plant growth and development (Medford et al., Plant Cell 1:403-413 1989; Smigocki, PNAS 85: 5131-5135, 1991). Remarkably, such deleterious pleiotrophs occurred even when some seemingly tissue or organ specific promoters were used to drive the IPT expression in plants. For example, when an auxin-inducible bidirectional promoter from the soybean SAUR gene was used to drive the expression of IPT in transgenic tobacco plants, the transgene-produced cytokinin was present in a tissue- and organ-specific manner. Yet the localized overproduction of cytokinins still resulted in a number of morphological and physiological off-types, including stunting, loss of apical dominance, reduction in root initiation and growth, abnormal leaf development, adventitious shoot formation from unwounded leaf veins and petioles, altered nutrient distribution, and abnormal tissue development in stems (Li, et al., Dev Biol 153: 386-395, 1992). When IPT was specifically expressed in developing seeds using a highly specific seed promoter, no seed size increase was observed (Roeckel et al., Transgenic Res 6:133-141, 1997). We show that, despite these and other teachings against expression of IPT in plants, the expression under certain cell cycle regulated promoters leads to advantageous phenotypes.
In accordance with the present invention, it has been found.
In accordance with one aspect of the invention transgenic plants expressing a cytokinin biosynthetic protein under the control of a cell cycle regulated promoter are provided wherein the plants exhibit at least one phenotypic trait selected from the group consisting of accelerated plant growth, increased organ size, increased organ number, increased reproductive organ number, increased seed size, increased silique number, and/or increased seed number when compared to a plant of the same species not expressing such cytokinin biosynthetic protein under the control of a cell cycle regulated promoter.
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, recombinant DNA polynucleotides comprising a cell cycle regulated promoter that functions in plants operably linked to a DNA polynucleotide which encodes a protein involved in cytokinin biosynthesis are provided.
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, cell cycle regulated promoters are provided. More particularly, such promoters are identified from the 5′ upstream region of the family of cyclin genes, such as the promoter regions selected from the group consisting of the CycD3 and CycB1 genes.

It has been discovered.
Isopentyl transferase (IPT) is a gene involved in cytokinin biosynthesis that may be isolated from many species. One particular IPT is a gene isolated from Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA. It has been shown that expression of IPT in transgenic plants resulted in elevated cytokinin accumulation, which was accompanied by morphological alterations of transgenic plants. Constitutive expression of IPT in an entire plant exhibits phenotypes that are not advantageous for a growing crop. Herein it is shown that the expression of IPT under the regulatory control of a cell cycle regulated promoter whose expression is predominantly in dividing cells of the plant provides advantageous phenotypes directed to yield that are useful for a growing crop plant.
“Isopentyl transferase” or “isopentenyl transferase” or “IPT” or “ipt” as used herein includes any enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of adenosine 5′-monphosphate or adenosine 5;-triphosphate and dimethylallyl disphosphate to N6-(Δ2-isopentenyl)adenosine 5′-phosphate, including but not limited to all isopentenyl transferase/dimethylallyl transferase from all sources including plants, animals, and microbes (Buchanan, et al., Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants, Courier Companies, Inc., USA, ISBN 0-943088-39-9; Haberer and Kieber, Plant Physiology 128:354 (2002)). “Isopentyl transferase” or “isopentenyl transferase” or “IPT” or “ipt” also includes any enzyme that increases cytokinin levels through a pathway which includes zeatinriboside-5′-monphosphate (ZMP) (Astot, et al., PNAS 97:14778-14883, 2000). Examples of IPT and IPT-like proteins that are within the scope of the invention include SEQ ID NOs: 2, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 22-359, and any protein related thereto, or any nucleotide sequence encoding such a protein including such nucleotide sequences that would hybridize to any of SEQ ID Nos: 1, 14, 16, 18 and 20 under stringent conditions as described hereinafter. IPT genes expected to function in the invention include, but are not limited to, for example, proteins which contain the motif found in many IPT genes, such as PF01715 are also expected to function in the invention. These latter motifs are from Pfam which describes IPT and IPPT as follows: IPT or isopentenyl transferase/dimethylallyl transferase synthesizes isopentenyladensosine 5′-monophosphate, a cytokinin that induces shoot formation on host plants infected with the Ti plasmid. IPPT). Pfam is a large collection of multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models covering many common protein families. Pfam version 12.0 (January 2004) contains alignments and models for 7316 protein families, based on the Swissprot 42.5 and SP-TrEMBL 25.6 protein sequence databases.
“Promoter,” as used herein, refers to a DNA polynucleotide that binds an RNA polymerase (either directly or indirectly through another transcription factors) and promotes transcription of a downstream DNA polynucleotide. The downstream DNA polynucleotide can be transcribed into an RNA that has function, such as rRNA, RNAi, dsRNA, or tRNA. Often, the RNA produced is a hetero-nuclear (hn) RNA that has introns which are spliced out to produce an mRNA (messenger RNA). A “plant promoter” is a native or non-native promoter that is functional in plant cells
A cell cycle regulated promoter is a promoter that is regulated in its expression during the cell cycle. Cell cycle regulated promoters, as used herein, are further characterized in that they express an operably linked polynucleotide at their highest levels in actively dividing cells as compared to non-dividing cells. Preferably, cell cycle regulated promoters of the present invention are characterized by a reduction of about 20%-about 30% in the expression level of an operably linked polynucleotide in non-dividing cells. More preferably, a cell cycle regulated promoter of the present invention has an expression pattern wherein 10% or less of the expression of an operably linked polynucleotide can be attributed to non-dividing cells. The promoters herein encompass not only the sequences of the cell cycle regulated promoters described herein, but sequences that hybridize (as defined hereinafter) to at least one of the cell cycle regulated promoter sequences provided herein and operative fragments thereof, that function as plant promoters in the same or similar manner. In particularly preferred embodiments, the cell cycle regulated promoter is a promoter isolated from a member of the cyclin gene family. Specific cyclin promoters include those selected from the group consisting of the promoters identified herein as CycD3 (SEQ ID NO:8) or CycB1 (SEQ ID NO:5), both Arabidopsis promoters. The term “cyclin” refers to a regulatory protein, comprising a protein domain of about 100 amino acids known as the “cyclin box”. The cyclin box is the binding site for cyclin-dependent kinases, allowing the cyclin to exert its regulatory effect on the kinase activity of the CDKs. A cyclin box can be identified by comparing the amino acid sequence of the protein with known cyclin boxes. An amino acid sequence identified as a cyclin box on the basis of sequence comparison should possess at least the 5 conserved residues required for cyclin activity R(97), D(126), L(144), K(155), and E(185) (indicated positions are from the sequence of CYCD2 from Arabidopsis thaliana) at equivalent positions. (See, e.g., Soni et al., Plant Cell, 7:85-103 (1995) and Renaudin et al., Plant Molecular Biology, 32:1003-1018 (1996)) (R=arginine, D=aspartic acid, L=leucine, K=lysine, and E=glutamic acid). Cyclin promoters are those promoters that drive the expression of cyclin genes at specific times within each cell cycle in the organism in which they occur, for example, plants. Specific cyclin promoters include those of specific cyclin genes, for example see the sequence listing and examples. Cell cycle progression requires the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) whose catalytic activity and substrate specificity are determined by cyclins and by other regulatory proteins (Hilde et al., Plant Molecular Biology, 43:583-593, 2000; Marcel and Murray, Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 4:44-49, 2002). The activity of the CDK-cyclin complexes is activated and deactivated at specific points in the cell cycle. Certain CDK-cyclin complexes are activated at the G1-S transition and trigger the start of DNA replication. Different CDK-cyclin complexes are activated at the G2/M transition and induce mitosis leading to cell division. As used herein, cell division control (CDC) genes are genes that control cell division, and are differently expressed during cell division. Promoters isolated from a CDC genes of specific types, for example, CDC2a (SEQ ID NO: 11) do not have expression patterns that provide high level expression predominantly in dividing cells.
A first nucleic acid or protein sequence displays “substantial identity” or “substantial similarity” to a reference nucleic acid sequence or protein if, when optimally aligned (with appropriate nucleotide or amino acid insertions or deletions totaling less than 20 percent of the reference sequence over the window of comparison) with the other nucleic acid (or its complementary strand) or protein, there is at least about 60% nucleotide sequence equivalence, even better would be 70%, preferably at least about 80% equivalence, more preferably at least about 85% equivalence, and most preferably at least about 90% equivalence over a comparison window of at least 20 nucleotide or amino acid positions, preferably at least 50 nucleotide or amino acid positions, more preferably at least 100 nucleotide or amino acid positions, and most preferably over the entire length of the first nucleic acid or protein. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm(s), preferably by computerized implementations of these algorithms (which can be found in, for example, Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.). The reference nucleic acid may be a full-length molecule or a portion of a longer molecule. Alternatively, two nucleic acids have substantial identity if one hybridizes to the other under stringent conditions. Appropriate hybridization conditions can be determined empirically, or can be estimated based, for example, on the relative G+C content of the probe and the number of mismatches between the probe and target sequence, if known. Hybridization conditions can be adjusted as desired by varying, for example, the temperature of hybridizing or the salt concentration (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1989).
The term “recombinant DNAs” or “recombinant DNA molecules” as used herein means DNAs that contains a genetically engineered modification through manipulation via mutagenesis, restriction enzymes, and the like. The polynucleotide itself can come from either naturally occurring sources or can be created in the laboratory. It can also include all vectors created by DNA engineering, for example, all the DNA molecules included herein designated by pMON. For example, it can include molecules containing naturally occurring DNA or cDNA, or DNA molecules of synthetic origin in a plasmid, or isolated DNA. A “recombinant” polynucleotide or “recombinant DNA molecule” can be made by an artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of a polynucleotide, e.g., by chemical synthesis or by the manipulation of isolated segments of polynucleotides by genetic engineering techniques. Techniques for nucleic-acid manipulation are well-known (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, N.Y. (1989); and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y. (1988). The terms “recombinant DNA construct”, “recombinant vector”, “expression vector” or “expression cassette” refer to any agent such as a plasmid, cosmid, virus, BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome), autonomously replicating polynucleotide, phage, or linear or circular single-stranded or double-stranded DNA or RNA polynucleotide, derived from any source, capable of genomic integration or autonomous replication, comprising a DNA molecule in which one or more DNA polynucleotides have been linked in a functionally operative manner.
Hybridization conditions are dependent on the sequence of the polynucleotide and will be different in different circumstances. As used herein “stringent conditions” are selected to be about 5° C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific polynucleotide at a defined ionic strength and pH. The “thermal melting point” is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of a target molecule hybridizes to a completely complementary molecule. Appropriate stringent, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, the salt concentration in the wash step can be selected from a low stringent condition of about 2.0×SSC at 50° C. to a high stringency of about 0.2×SSC at 50° C. In addition, the temperature in the wash step can be increased from low stringent conditions at room temperature, about 22° C., to high stringent conditions at about 65° C. Both temperature and salt concentration may be varied, or either the temperature or the salt concentration may be held constant while the other variable is changed. For the purposes of this disclosure, stringent conditions include at least one wash in 2.0×SSC at a temperature of at least about 50° C. for 20 minutes, or equivalent conditions.
A first polynucleotide is “operably linked” with a second polynucleotide when the polynucleotides are so arranged that the first polynucleotide affects the function of the second polynucleotide. Often, the two polynucleotides are part of a single contiguous polynucleotide molecule and sometimes are adjacent. For example, a promoter is operably linked to a gene if the promoter regulates or mediates transcription of the gene. A promoter is “naturally operably linked” to a structural gene if the promoter drives the transcription of the structural gene in the genome of an organism when said promoter and said structural gene are in their native locations within said genome.
“Heterologous” sequence refers to a sequence which originates from a foreign source or species or, if from the same source or species, is modified from its original form; for example, a gene from a fungus being expressed in a plant; or a gene from the same species present under a different promoter, or a promoter driving the expression of a gene or RNA in a non-native location within the genome.
An “isolated” nucleic acid sequence or DNA molecule.
“Native” refers to a naturally occurring (“wild-type”) nucleic acid sequence.
In a preferred embodiment, the instant invention comprises a transgenic plant comprising a recombinant DNA molecule having a cell cycle regulated promoter operably linked to a cytokinin biosynthetic enzyme. The plant may be a monocotyledonous plant or dicotyledonous, and includes but is not limited to corn, soybean, Arabidopsis, cotton, wheat, rice, and canola.
Recombinant DNA molecules of the instant invention can be transformed into a many commercially useful plants. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a transgenic plant expressing the desired protein is to be produced. In this case the desired protein may be operably linked to particular promoter controlling expression in a cell cycle regulated way.. Exemplary particles include those comprised of tungsten, platinum, and preferably, gold..
Microprojectile bombardment techniques are widely applicable, and may be used to transform virtually any plant species. Examples of species that have been transformed by microprojectile bombardment include monocot species such as maize (PCT Publication WO 95/06128), barley, wheat (U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,055, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), rice, oat, rye, sugarcane, and sorghum; as well as a number of dicots including tobacco, soybean (U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,783, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), sunflower, peanut, cotton, tomato, and legumes in general (U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,055, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety)..
The regeneration, development, and cultivation of plants from various transformed explants.
The regeneration, development and cultivation of plants from single plant protoplast transformants or from various transformed explants is well known in the art. See generally, Maliga et al., Methods in Plant Molecular Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1995); Weissbach and Weissbach, In: Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1988). Plants of the present invention can be part of or generated from a breeding program, and may also be reproduced using apomixis. Methods for the production of apomictic plants are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,636.
The transgenic plant prepared in accordance with the invention may be of any generation, including a fertile or sterile R0 transgenic plant as well as seeds thereof, and hybrid seed wherein the seed comprises a cell cycle regulated promoter operably linked to a cytokinin biosynthetic enzyme, e.g. isopentyl transferase. Also included within the invention are progeny plants of any generation of such a fertile R0 transgenic plant as well as seed of a progeny plant.
Another aspect of the present invention relates to methods for obtaining a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence of the present invention. One method for obtaining a nucleic acid molecule encoding all or a substantial portion of the amino acid sequence of a protein encoded on the same gene as the sequences described herein would be: (a) probing a cDNA or genomic library with a hybridization probe comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding all or a substantial portion of a DNA, cDNA, or RNA molecule described herein (b) identifying a DNA clone that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the hybridization probe; (c) isolating the DNA clone identified in step (b); and (d) sequencing the cDNA or genomic fragment that comprises the clone isolated in step (c).
The IPT gene (SEQ ID NO: 1 and 2) of 720 bp from Agrobacterium tumefaciens was amplified by PCR from plasmid pMON38210, using two primers that introduced a NcoI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end of the amplified gene. The two primer sequences are CGCGGCCCATGGATCTGCGTCTAATTTTCGGTCCAAC (Seq ID NO: 3) and CGGCGCGAATTCTAATACATTCCGAATGGATGACCTT (Seq ID NO: 4).
The promoter of Arabidopsis CycB1 (Seq ID NO: 5) was cloned by using the upstream DNA polynucleotide sequence of CycB1 from the genomic clone with Genbank number AL035601. Two primers were designed to amplify from the total genomic DNA the 1550 bp fragment immediately upstream from the ATG start codon, introducing a PacI site at the 5′ end and a NcoI site at the 3′ end. The two primer sequences are CGCGGCTTAATTAAGAGCAATAACAGTGTGTGAGGCATT (SEQ ID NO: 6) and CGGCGCCCATGGTCTTAGTGTTCTCTTCTCTTTCTCTC (SEQ ID NO: 7). To clone the promoter of Arabidopsis CycD3 (SEQ ID NO: 8), the upstream sequence of 1500 bp was determined from the genomic contig AL161585 (Genbank), which was then cloned by PCR using two primers that introduced a Pad site at the 5′ end and a NcoI site at the 3′ end. The primer sequences are: CGCGGCTTAATTAAGCATTATGCGGGAGCAAAGGTAAGT (SEQ ID NO: 9) and CGGCGCCCATGGTGGGGGACTAAACTCAAGAATGAGAA (SEQ ID NO: 10). Similarly, to clone the promoter of CDC2a (SEQ ID NO: 11) from Arabidopsis, the corresponding 1400 bp upstream sequence was determined from AL132963 (Genbank number), and amplified from genomic DNA using two primers, introducing a AscI site at the 5′ end and a NcoI site at the 3′ end. The two primer sequences are: CGCGGCGGCGCGCCATATATATTATTATATAAATATAAC (SEQ ID NO: 12) and CGCGGCCCATGGTTTCCTGAATAATAAAGCTGAAG (SEQ ID NO: 13).
To construct the binary vector of IPT driven by the constitutive 35S promoter, the binary vector pMON23450 was linearized with NcoI and EcoRI, followed by ligation with the NcoI-EcoRI IPT fragment. The resulting vector was named pMON66507 (FIG. 8), in which the IPT gene is under the control of an enhanced 35S promoter (e35S). To put the IPT gene under the control of the CycB1 promoter, pMON66507 was digested with PacI and NcoI to release the e35S promoter, which was then replace by the PacI-NcoI P_CycB1 fragment. The resulting vector was named as pMON66508. Similarly, the PacI-NcoI P_CycD3 fragment was used to replace the e35S promoter in pMON66507 to generate the plasmid pMON66509, in which the IPT gene is under the control of the CycD3 promoter. To construct the IPT gene under the control of P_CDC2a, the amplified P_CDC2a fragment was digested with AscI and NcoI and ligated to pMON66507 that had the e35S promoter released by AscI and NcoI. The resulting plasmid was named as pMON66510.
The constructed binary expression vectors from Example 1 were used to transform Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia using an Agrobacterium mediated procedure. Transformants were selected on kanamycin MS plates and thirty two independent transformation events were transferred to potted soil in growth chamber and grown to maturity for seed harvest. Expression of the IPT transgene was monitored at the transcript level using Taqman analysis.
Plant Growth
Seeds of the transgenic plants were sowed in potted soil along with wild-type plants (controls), and were vernalized at 4° C. for three days before moving to a growth chamber. The plants were grown under the following conditions: at 22° C., 24 hours constant light with light intensity of 170-200 μm Einstein m−2s−1, and a humidity of 70%. Plants were also grown under short day conditions, with 10 hours of light period. Plants were fertilized twice a week using Peters 20-20-20 fertilizer (in half strength) from Hummert International, Earth City, Mo.).
RT-PCR Analysis
Total RNA was prepared from roots, rosette leaves and flowers of Arabidopsis plants using Trizol reagent from Life Technologies (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md. U.S.A.). The RNA was then treated with DNAse and column purified. All samples were adjusted to same concentration based on spectrophotometer readings. 2.4 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA in a 20 μl reaction with SuperScript II-RT Kit (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.) according to the manufacture\'s procedure. An aliquot of 1 μl of the synthesized cDNA was used as template for PCR reaction (a total volume of 50 μl), using gene-specific primers. The reactions were limited to 20 cycles so the amplifications were still in linear range. The amplified PCR products were resolved on agarose gels and photographed.
Real-Time PCR (Taqman) Analysis
Two hole punches, or a piece of the youngest leaf tip approximately 1-cm long, were sampled from each Arabidopsis thaliana plant. The sampled tissue was placed in 96 well format boxes (1.1 ml micro tubes, VWR, Cat# 20901-027) with 4 mm parylene-coated stir balls (V&P Scientific, Cat#725E-1) on dry ice. Equal volumes of nucleic acid purification lysis solution (ABI, Cat#. 4305895) and Phosphate Buffered Saline (Life Technologies, Cat # 12394-011) were added. 0.40 ml of the Lysis buffer/PBS mixture (1:1 of 2×ABI Nucleic acid purification lysis solution and LifeTech Ca—Mg free 1×PBS) was added to each well, then tightly cap the tubes. The tissue was homogenized by shaking the samples with a Qiagen MixerMill—MM300 (Qiagen, Cat# 85110) for 5 minutes at 30 rev/sec. Particulate matter was removed using a 96 well QiaFilter (Qiagen, Cat# 10020). Genomic DNA was prepared using the Automated Nucleic Acid Workstation from Applied Biosystems (ABI, Cat#6700). 25 μl PCR reactions were prepared using the ABI 2× SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix, (ABI, Cat# 4304437) and 10 μl of template DNA prepared on the ABI6700. Primers used were purchased from Life Technologies and were used at the same concentration in all experiments.
Real-time thermo cycling was performed on the ABI 7700 with standard cycling conditions of: 50° C. for 2 minutes, 95° C. for 10 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95° C. for 20 seconds, 60° C. for 1 minute. Standard data analysis procedures were followed for baseline adjustment then the data was screened for two-fold standard deviation of variance. Results of these analysis are discussed below. IPT was differentially expressed among different promoters in transgenic plants.
Gene Expression Results.
Four promoters were used to drive the expression of IPT in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, CycD3, CycB1, CDC2a, as well as the constitutive e35S promoter. The CycB1 promoter, P_CycB1, is expressed at the G2/M phase. The CycD3 promoter, P_CycD3, is expressed throughout the cell cycle in dividing cells. Both P_CycB1 and P_CycD3 are therefore cell cycle promoters. CDC2a, encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase, is constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle, and is expressed in certain non-dividing cells. We conducted a semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay on the expression patterns of these genes in wild-type Arabidopsis plants. As is shown in FIG. 1, CycD3 and CycB1 were most abundantly expressed in flower and root tissues, but were expressed at much reduced level in expanding leaves, with CycB1 only showing trace amount of leaf expression. In contrast, CDC2a was expressed at about same but relatively low level in the different tissues. Because expanding leaves have been shown to only have trace cell division activity, these results confirm that CDC2a expression is not tightly correlated with cell division.
Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing IPT under the direction of the four different promoters were generated. Given the fact that all the promoters are capable of directing at least low levels of gene expression in leaves, we conducted transgene expression assays using the young leaf tissues from the transgenic plants. FIG. 2 shows the real-time quantitative RT-PCR, as well as the copy number determination (Taqman) of multiple independent transgenic plants expressing IPT from the four promoters. It is apparent that the strong promoter e35S led to high level IPT expression, while the promoters of CycD3, CycB1 and CDC2a resulted in significantly reduced expression. A comparison of the expression levels of the transgene driven by the promoters of CycB1, CycD3 and CDC2a showed that plants containing P_CycD3::IPT had the highest leaf expression level, whereas that of P_CycB1::IPT had the lowest. In the latter case, the one plant with a single copy of the transgene showing relatively high level of IPT expression is likely a result of transgene positional effect. Interestingly, although the CDC2a promoter is stronger than that of CycD3 in directing transcription in leaves (FIG. 1), the expression of IPT driven by CDC2a promoter was much lower than that driven by CycD3 promoter in the leaf tissues (FIGS. 2C and D); furthermore, while the IPT expression level of transgenic events driven by the promoter of CycD3 appeared to be positively correlated with the copy number of the transgene per genome, with more copies having higher level of transgene expression (FIG. 2C), all the transgenic plants expressing IPT driven by the CDC2a promoter contained only one copy of the transgene. This could at least partly suggest that high level of IPT expression by CDC2a promoter was deleterious, and only those with lower copy and thus lower expression had survived. Four independent transgenic events expressing IPT from the CDC2a promoter were advanced and their progeny analyzed for expression and transgene copy number. It was shown that 2 out of the 4 events resulted in progenies segregating 1:1 for 1 vs. 0 copy transgene, while the other two events had the majority of the progenies containing only one copy of the transgene, with a few plants missing the transgene (data not shown), which further suggest that, not only high level IPT by the CDC2a promoter was deleterious to the plant growth, but also the deleterious effect appeared to take place at gametophytic stage, resulting in the high occurrence of negative segregants.
Methods
Seed Size Analysis
To determine the seed size of different transgenic plants, about 50 transgenic seeds (V2 and V3) were dispersed evenly in an area of about 0.5 cm in diameter on a flat surface, along with wild-type controls. Magnified Images were then taken and the image size in pixels was determined using the Image-Plus™ software. Four samples for each seed set were used in the analysis, and statistical significance of the seed size variation was determined by T-test.
A high throughput screen was also developed internally to determine the Arabidopsis seed size. The software is a UNIX command line image processing program that automatically segments images containing touching seeds, screens out non-seed subjects, and then measures the areas of seeds on TIF images. Using this program, seeds from about 600 independent transgenic events involving 21 vectors were assayed for seed size compared to wild-type controls. The Arabidopsis with cyclin promoters operably linked to IPT showed increased seed size. Detailed analysis is discussed in the results section of this example.
Canopy Size/Vegetative Growth Rate Determination.
Transgenic plants, along with wild-type controls, were arranged in Latin Square, with 12 plants for each genotype, and grown under uniform conditions. At days 25, 32 and 42, images were taken for each plants, and the canopy size of the one-dimensional image was determined with the Image-Plus software. Statistical significance of size variation was determined using T-test. The growth rate for a given genotype was determined by comparing the percentage of canopy size variation of that genotype to wild-type among different growth stages. The Arabidopsis with cyclin promoters operably linked to IPT showed increased canopy size/growth rate. Detailed analysis is discussed in the results section of this example.
Analysis of Other Plant Seed Weight Components.
When siliques were starting to turn yellow, individual plants were placed within transparent plastic cones to prevent tangling and thus facilitate seed collection. At maturity, both siliques and seeds were harvested and naturally dried for quantitative analysis, including seed weight per plant, silique number per plant and silique length. For silique length, 50 siliques were randomly selected from each plant, and the means were used for comparison. The Arabidopsis with cyclin promoters operably linked to IPT showed increased seed weight. Detailed analysis is discussed in the results section of this example.
Results.
IPT Expression in Non-Dividing Cells LED to Abnormal Plant Growth and Development.
The deleterious effect of non-specific IPT expression was manifested throughout the plant life cycle. When the transgenic seeds were plated on selection medium, seeds transformed with E35S::IPT and P_CDC2a::IPT exhibited much lower shoot regeneration rates when compared to those transformed with P_CycD3::IPT and P_CycB1::IPT. As is shown in FIG. 3A, with similar effort for each transgene, while we were able to generate more than 250 independent transgenic shoots transformed with P_CycB1::IPT (bar 2) and P_CycD3::IPT (bar 3), only 4 events for E35S::IPT (bar 1) and 50 events for P_CDC2a::IPT (bar 4) were generated. Furthermore, as is shown in FIG. 3B, the regenerated transgenic shoots survived differently, with E35S::IPT shoots (bar 1) having only one survive to maturity, which turned out to be the event with the lowest IPT expression; for P_CDC2a::IPT plants, only 25% of the shoots were able to grow to maturity (bar 4). In contrast, over 95% of the transgenic shoots of P_CycB1::IPT (bar 2) and P_CycD3::IPT (bar 3) developed and grew to maturity. The pleiotropic effect of the transgenes E35S::IPT involved a number of abnormalities (FIG. 4, Panel A), including the lack of root development, severely retarded shoot growth, extensive leaf curling and reproductive arrest. Most of the plants died before the flowering stage. A similar, though less severe, phenomenon was also observed for the transgenic plants of P_CDC2a::IPT, with one third of the seedlings failed to set seeds as a result of retarded plant growth and development (FIG. 4, Panel B). Remarkably, the deleterious effect of P_CDC2a driven IPT expression became apparent at very early stages of plant development, as all the kanamycin resistant seedlings had very low level of IPT expression (FIG. 2). On the other hand, over 95% of the transgenic plants of P_CycB1::IPT (FIG. 3B, bar 2) and P_CycD3::IPT (bar 3) were developmentally normal throughout their life cycle (FIG. 6).
It has been shown previously that transgenic expression of IPT by various promoters resulted in deleterious pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development, the inventors reasoned that such pleiotrophs were likely due to the ectopic expression of IPT and consequently forced division in cells that were not committed to proper patterning after cell mass increase. Several lines of evidence from this study suggested that uncontrolled expression pattern, rather than the level of expression, was indeed a cause of the deleterious effect of the transgene on plant growth and development. First, a survey of the IPT transgene expression levels and the normality of plant growth and development when using the four different promoters showed that the transgenic plants were able to tolerate much higher level of IPT expression when the transgene was driven by the cell cycle-specific promoters P_CycD3 and P_CycB1 than that driven by non-specific promoters 35S and P_CDC2a (Table 1).

Thus while only at very low level of IPT expression that the transgenic plants harboring E35S::IPT could grow and develop normally, they would display normal plant growth and development even at 200 folds increase in IPT expression when driven by the CycD3 promoter, suggesting not only that plant development is very sensitive to uncontrolled pattern of IPT expression, but also that the cells that had been programmed for cell division are a primary natural target of cytokinin for growth regulation, and can tolerate high levels of transgene expression without disrupting the subsequent organ patterning and formation.
Taking together, these results demonstrated that cytokinin expression in non-dividing cells in plants as shown by the IPT expression by P_CDC2a, had a pleiotropic effect, leading to abnormal plant growth and development. In contrast, cell cycle-specific IPT expression, directed by the promoters P_CycB1 and P_CycD3, were able to effectively eliminate the deleterious effects associated with uncontrolled IPT expression, and even at relatively high transgene expression level, the transgenic plants were able to grow and develop much like the wild-type plants.
Cyclin-Dependent IPT Expression led to Accelerated Plant Growth Rate
The inventors further examined the effect of IPT expression from the different promoters used in this study on plant growth rate. The inventors wanted to determine whether amplified cytokinin expression in the natural cyclin-expressing cells would also lead to accelerated plant growth rate. To this end, the inventors conducted an experiment to quantify the morphological variations of transgenic plants compared to wild-type controls in the course of plant life cycle. FIG. 5 shows the accelerated plant growth rate of a typical transgenic plant of P_CycD3::IPT compared to a typical wild-type control plant. For example, at the age of 32 days, the transgenic plants of P_CycD3::IPT exhibited a critically significant (P<0.01) canopy size increase by 35% over that of the wild-type control (FIG. 5). Size comparison of leaves of the same position showed that the transgenic leaves were much larger than the wild-type control (FIG. 5A, lower panel). Noticeably, the degrees of canopy size increase varied along the growth stages, with the largest increase after about one month plant growth, and the increase declining at flowering. Thus the canopy size increase over wild-type control was 28%, 32% and 18% when measured at days 25, 32 and 42 after sowing, respectively (FIG. 5B
It was previously shown that, although the constitutive CycD2 expression could accelerate the growth rate of transgenic tobacco plants, the transgenic plants flowered earlier than the non-transformed plants, resulting in plants that are similar in size and overall productivity as compared to the wild-type controls at maturity. The inventors examined the organ size, organ number and overall plant productivity of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing IPT from the cell cycle-specific promoters. In contrast to over-expression of CycD2 by the 35S promoter, cell cycle-specific IPT expression, while accelerating the plant growth rate, did not alter the timing of developmental stages, with the transgenic plants flowering at the same time as the wild-type controls (FIG. 5A). Furthermore, by comparing to the wild-type control, It is clear that the transgenic plants, while developing normally, showed an overall enhanced productivity, including increased leaf size/vegetative mass (FIGS. 5A and B), increased plant height, increased branch number, increased flower and silique number (FIG. 6).
The inventors further examine all the transgenic events for the size of seeds, an organ in which CycD3, CycB1 and CDC2a in their native forms all express in wild-type Arabidopsis plants, and the size of which is mainly determined by cell cycle and the resulting cell number. The inventors developed an automated seed size (seed image area in pixels) screen and assayed the seed size of all the 70 independent transgenic lines that had been advanced, including 29 transgenic events of P_CycB1::IPT, 30 of P_CycD3::IPT, 10 of P_CDC2a::IPT, and 1 of E35S::IPT. A power calculation has determined that, at high detection power of 95%, our standard operation protocol would be capable of detecting 9% seed size difference at critically significant level (P<0.01). Using 10% as the cut-off value, the inventors showed (FIG. 7) that 72% of the P_CycB1::IPT events and 63% of the P_CycD3::IPT events exhibited significant seed size increase, ranging from 10% to 70% size increase over wild-type controls. In contrast, none of the P_CDC2a::IPT nor E35S::IPT events exhibited significant seed size increase. These results demonstrate that the amplified expression of cytokinin in dividing cells not only eliminated the deleterious pleiotrophs associated with ectopic cytokinin expression, but also accelerated target organ growth and size with high phenotypic penetrance. The improvement of multiple attributes of the transgenic plants expressing IPT from the cell cycle-specific promoters, including increased silique/seed number and increased seed size, has led to the increased seed production of the transgenic plants.

The day of the month where we all copy a look we've seen on someone else!
This month I am copying the adorable Kourtney Kardashian.
This is not my first time copying a Kardashian, and last time I copied one it was Kim and I wore this same camel colored blazer!
What can I say? We're all Armenian and they have great style!
I don't know why I keep choosing looks with hair up. I seriously NEVER wear my hair up and so I'm confused as to why I decided to do it again. Oh wells.
The good news is that when we were walking over to take these pictures Ian said, "You look like Kim Kardashian from behind. That seems like something she would wear."
Although I'm copying her sister Kourtney this time, I took that as a compliment because that is exactly what I was going for... obviously!
So there you have it!

Frisco Fire Safety Town is a place where children learn real life strategies for dealing with emergencies while developing a positive attitude towards safety. Frisco Fire Safety Town combines traditional classroom education methods with unique interactive experiences in a realistic child-sized townscape. Children participate in activities designed to build self-confidence and to strengthen their ability to make safe decisions. Students then have the opportunity to practice a variety of their newly learned safety skills in a safe environment, complete with 5/8th scale replicas of local buildings, roads with realistic pavement markings, traffic signals and street signs.
Interactive areas include an actual living room and kitchen, which illustrate various fire safety hazards such as a lighter and matches, candles, frayed electrical cords and an overloaded electrical outlet. A child sized bedroom is equipped with a nontoxic “smoke machine” that demonstrates to students how smoke fills a room during a fire. Children then have the opportunity to practice escaping safely from a bedroom through either their primary or backup escape route.
Pedestrian, bicycle and motor vehicle safety are taught in an outdoor environment while children operate battery powered vehicles and ride bicycles on realistic streets. Children have the unique opportunity to practice safety skills from both youth and an adult perspective, while remaining in the safe environment of Frisco Fire Safety Town and under the watchful eye of trained educators.

Why is it that the part of this that bothers me the most is "She loses his stripes"?
As Bobby rightly pointed out, Fail.

What the hell do mythological creatures have to do with evolution?

I read about the afterlife
"Lions are felines, true."
Yes, good. And dogs are Canine!
"Lions and cats evolved from reptiles or others, false."
The "or others" part is actually true.
"Let's take an example:
You care of a tiger in your house. and with time, she loses his stripes"
okay one: is this hypothetical tiger transgendered? Secondly, why would he/she lose his/her stripes?
"She will look all orange and white. but she is still a tiger."
Yeah, okay. I guess.
"She will give birth to tiger cubs and they will grow to be tigers."
No shit sherlock.
"If they continue like that, after a hundred years, they will always be tigers..."
Yep. Pretty much. Of course, they might be longer or shorter and have slight changes due to survival of the fittest.
"You can call them cats or big cats. But they won't grow horns or wings."
Again, no shit sherlock.
"mythological creates play a lot with evolutionists minds. The likes of Minotaur and pegasus are behind all this evolution hoax."
All I've learned from your rambling is that you're a lunatic that knows jack shit about evolution.

You really don't have a fucking clue what evolution really is all about, do you?
Let me give you a hint, the ones who keep resorting to magic are the creationists.
Call it a hoax if you want to but so far all the evidence is in favor of it, not your stupid myth.

Clearly you have not a fucking clue how evolution works. Moving a tiger into your house will not make her 'lose her stripes'.
And hundreds of years? Oy.. your dumb is making my brain hurt.
Mythological creatures that were written about thousands of years ago, before evolution was even considered??? Please, don't breed.

Creotards are hominoids, true.
Creotards evolved into hominids, false.
There is something called adapting to one's environment. Creotards have abjectly failed to do this. Their hair dye and polyester levels may change with their denomination, but the stupidity will remain the same.
Let's take an example:
You take care of FullWhiteMoon in your house, and over time she/he learns to sit upright and not to fling feces. But FWM is still a moron and will keep mouthing idiocies. If FWM lives for a hundred years she/he will still be a stranger to reason. You can call him/her human, but FWM still won't know an ass from an elbow.
Mythology plays a lot with creotard minds. Stories of talking snakes and flying telepathic zombies are behind all this creationism hoax.

"Lions are felines, true." Very nice of you to admit to this tricky, little known fact.
" color/nature/habits may change....but the animal will remain the same." Um, no. It can't change and still stay the same. Only god could do that, if he existed.
Take a tiger into your house and you will lose your head (literally - they are hungry carnivores, y'know) long before she loses her stripes - which will never happen.
Very astute of you, though, to understand that a mummy tiger gives birth to baby tigers and not to baby elephants or baby penguins. You should get a job teaching biology and zoology in Texas. It would be a step up for their education system, by the sounds of it.
PS Mythical creatures never evolved coz they never axisted. That's why they are mythical. Think of god, for example, and you will understand what I mean.

AHHHH YESSSSSSSSSSSSSs.....the old fundie creation science argument about "adaptation" instead of evolution.
To wit: "there is something called to adapt with the evironment. color/nature/habits may change with the climate and other reasons. but the animal will remain the same.
Oh REALLY????? Let's see how well that works. If you make a poodle a guard dog, will it turn into a german shepard? How about racing a chihuahua, will it "adapt" into a greyhound? If you put a pigeon into the water, will it "adapt" into a duck?
And... in case you didnt realize it ....evolutionists realize that "the like of Minotaur and gegasus" or mythologies. Evidently you think that believers in evolution think they are real. Shows how much you really truly understand about evolution. Notta.....

Oh crap, he's onto me. I indeed only agree with the theory of evolution because of coercion by a minotaur. If it weren't for the minotaur I would actually believe in god and creationism. But every time I start to believe in god the minotaur comes along and jabs me in the back with its horns, threatening to run me through with them. Damn you mINOTAUr, dAMN YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Nope, Minotaurs and Pegasuses are completely against the theory of evolution, they are part of a religion mythology.
Lions and cats evolved from lion/cat-looking animals, who evolved from somewhat less lion/cat-looking animals, who evolved from even less lion/cat-looking animals, and so on. I highly doubt they evolved from reptiles.

ToE doesn't support their existence either. Basically, you're railing against something you have absolutely no understanding of. Your post is in good company here.

So you're saying that even though the animal will change it will remain the same? What the fuck are you on about?
If a tiger was to 'lose' its stripes, that would mean that a genetic change/mutation had occurred and the animal has changed. Even though that particular mutation may not inhibit cross-breeding, it's still a mutation. That's called evolution, dumbass.

Tammy and her husband David live in Kansas City. In October 2008, Tammy went to give blood, something she had done almost every year since she turned 21. After having her hemoglobin checked, Tammy was told she was a little anemic. It was recommended that she get some more tests from her doctor, which she did. A complete blood analysis was done; all her counts were low. Following a bone marrow biopsy in November, she was diagnosed with mylodysplastic syndrome, the precursor to leukemia.
Over the next few months, her condition deteriorated rapidly. Though she had no clue she was sick when she first got the test results, she quickly started to develop symptoms. The doctors did what they could to keep it from progressing, but it was obvious that she would need a bone marrow transplant in order to survive. David's latest email summarized the ordeal: "That was the beginning of a long, arduous process requiring this family to fully rely on the Lord for the healing Tammy would need."
Friends were kept informed of Tammy's progress through periodic blogs from her husband, and we all celebrated when we heard that an anonymous donor had given Tammy the blood she needed.
A year ago David had posted, "We were talking earlier tonight that her donor is now 39 years old. Somewhere, he is probably thinking about the sacrifice he made, and we hope he is proud of his service. We still hope to meet him someday to say thank you in person."
That wish came true last week when Tammy received a phone call from a man named Jim who, as it turned out, was her match. In David's own words: "We have shed a lot of tears of joy today, as Tammy finally got to say thanks to the man who saved her life. He didn't want any credit for that. He just wanted to know how she was doing. He readily acknowledges God's role in this story. He and Tammy talked about God's will during their discussion, and Jim recognizes that God led him to drive past that fire station that day.
"It turns out that Jim is from Waverly, a small town in upstate New York, about 100 miles south of Syracuse. The fire station in his community was having a bone marrow drive one day in early spring 2009, and he felt the nudge of God to go in and sign up. When he got the call that he might be a match for a 49-year-old woman in Kansas, he agreed to be a donor. Tammy is alive today because of his willingness to obey that nudge."
David's email continued: "We had a bone marrow drive at our church in Kansas City, but around the same time, the fire station in Waverly was having its own drive. It may have been in honor of someone in that area, but God had other plans. Just like He had a friend of ours donate her bone-marrow to someone about a year and a half ago as a result of our drive, He had Jim respond to the sign at the firehouse to save Tammy's life.
"Today, Tammy is the picture of health. She amazes people with how good she looks (like she's been amazing me with her beauty for more than 45 years). No one who doesn't know her story can believe that she survived cancer so recently.
"Thanks, in large part, to our new friend Jim, who was willing to respond to the divine nudge of the mighty God we serve."
Reading Tammy's story reminds me to become keenly aware of those "divine nudges," no matter how inconvenienced I might be. I hope it does the same for you.)

The Starboard Seak, by Amber Dermont, Corsair, RRP£14.99/ St Martin’s Press, RRP$24.99, 320 pages
Amber Dermont’s debut novel is set in the summer of 1987, and we first meet Jason Prosper on his 18th birthday. He is, according to his father, “damaged goods” and the story opens with father and son driving together; Jason daydreaming about “the car flipping forward and crushing Dad’s body.” They are en route to Bellingham Academy, a boarding school specialising in second chances for the delinquent offspring of America’s elite. At Bellingham, Jason explains, “If you could pay, you could stay.”
Jason can’t forget his best friend, sailing partner and secret lover, Cal. It was Jason who discovered Cal’s body in the bathroom at their prep school, but the truth about the events that led to Cal’s death and Jason’s subsequent expulsion are withheld until the end of the novel.
Jason tries to fit in at his new school by joining the sailing club, only to quit after the first tryout ends with his sailing partner momentarily trapped under the water. He retreats, and befriends a girl called Aidan. The pair become lovers. When she disappears, Jason takes it upon himself to work out what has happened to her. Learning of Aidan’s fate, he feels “the waves of this new truth, this new loss crash over me”.
The sea is a constant presence, both physically and in the language used: Dermont’s passion is sailing, and the novel’s title, The Starboard Sea, is a made-up sailing reference. As Cal explains to Jason: “It means the right sea, the true sea, or like finding the best path in life.”
Dermont sketches Bellingham’s self-contained world of privilege with authority and ambitiously borrows characters and themes from Shakespeare: Jason Prosper and his lovers Cal and Aidan evoke Prospero and his servants Caliban and Ariel in The Tempest.
The Starboard Sea also exposes illusions of justice and power. At Bellingham fortune is fickle and power breeds cruelty: the Black Monday crash robs one student of her place at the school. As her dishevelled father comes to collect her in an old station wagon, Dermont writes: “She put me in mind of a fabulous hotel room some rock star had trashed.”
Meanwhile, the male students torture one another in ritual initiation rites that have been passed down through generations. Having been rolled up in a carpet and left out on a football field in the cold, Jason thinks only of revenge: “I can’t wait to get even. I can’t wait to do this to someone else.”
Dermont measures out the stories behind Jason’s twin tragedies coolly, without altering the pace of her well-crafted narrative.

Comments:The entire idea of signing up on the Do Not Call List is because you don't want these people calling you. People includes the automated, worse than having a real telemarketer call you, machines. I do NOT want these people bothering me in any form or fashion. Furthermore, "prior business relationship" is abused beyond all recognition - "we sent Bob a peice of mail, so we have a prior business relationship."

Fulbright Partner and Former U.S. Attorney Michael Shelby Dies at Age 47
Michael T. Shelby
Partner
Houston
Mr. Shelby passed away Tuesday at age 47. He fought an extended battle with cancer. His favorite saying was “remember what’s important.”
“The partners and employees at Fulbright & Jaworski are deeply saddened by the loss of Michael Shelby,” said Steven B. Pfeiffer, chair of Fulbright’s Executive Committee. “Michael dedicated his life to public service and making sure the law was upheld. His honorable life and career is one to be emulated by others. We at Fulbright were honored to have worked alongside Michael – a man who inspired so many. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to the entire Shelby family.”
He spent most of his career with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, with the last three years as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, one of the largest and most prolific federal judicial districts in the nation. Mr. Shelby wanted to make sure his two young daughters were able to attend colleges they chose. As a result, he decided to leave behind public service and enter private practice.
Leon Jaworski had long been an inspiration to Mr. Shelby, who decided Fulbright was the place where he would take his comprehensive experience in white-collar crime and government investigations.
“Michael said he wanted to be a part of the firm Leon Jaworski helped build,” Mr. Pfeiffer said. “Like Col. Jaworski, Michael had a passion for public service, was a trusted leader and took difficult stances in the courtroom.”
Mr. Shelby was born in Central Texas and raised in Houston. After attending Texas A&M University, he went onto law school at the University of Texas. He later became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Naval Reserves. He served in the Middle East during Operation Desert Storm, and his active military duty also included service in Bosnia.
Mr. Shelby’s legal career began in the Harris County District Attorney’s office, where he spent five years in the Special Prosecutions Division. He joined the U.S. Attorney’s office in 1989 as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. He specialized in the investigation and prosecution of cases involving public corruption, organized crime and environmental law.
Mr. Shelby prosecuted corrupt public officials after moving to Phoenix in 1997 and then returned to Houston in 2001 to become the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.
As the U.S. Attorney, Mr. Shelby served on the President’s Corporate Fraud Task Force. He tried more than 250 state and federal jury trials and argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit during his legal career.
In June 2005, Mr. Shelby became a partner at Fulbright, where he headed the firm’s nationwide white-collar criminal defense practice.
“Michael brought a combination of experience, trial skills and tremendous respect when he joined Fulbright,” Mr. Pfeiffer said. “We’ll always remember the remarkable contributions he made throughout his career.”
When not serving and protecting others, Mr. Shelby basked in the time he had with his wife, two daughters, family and friends.
“When Michael wasn’t on a foreign battleground or in a courtroom, he was a family man who enjoyed life,” Mr. Pfeiffer said. “He was known for his adventuresome spirit and fondness for skydiving, cars and space. He was a man of great courage. He fought a difficult battle against cancer.”

Hi,
i could talk to somebody who would want to chart to person from russia but i cannot be useful for whose who learn english language as i myself need someone native what to improve my english (most of all i mean my pronunciation).
Hi Natalia. I understand your comment about needing to speak with a native English speaker but chatting to people from other non-English speaking countries is also useful in different ways. You will get to listen to different accents (in the real world there are literally 1000s of different accents) and you must make sure your English language is clear and easy for people to understand. It's just another - slightly different - way to practice English!
i agree with you Jamie, I would just like people to know I only teach English as well and do not want to disappoint them. any way, we should try any possibility to improve our english skills.
Ok
IT will be nice to practice english with you

Would anyone be interested in setting up a group conversation? A few members can log in at the same time and talk about a subject - for example a news story or one of our lessons. It will be difficult because we are all in different time zones but it might be worth a try in the future.
This is something I will arrange for some time after the New Year. If you are interested let me know and we'll try and make it happen!
Hi ! I think it would be very interesring to talk in a group. I live in Austria GMT +1 so maybe it's difficult to join. Please let me know when you arrange a group and I will try to be there.

I am using my laptop for development and all desktop stuff. (LXDE with compiz - looks great, works fine, consumes few power)
When I switch on my machine I see my funtoo grub theme. This is followed by my funtoo boottime splash. This is also schown when suspending, hibernating and waking up and shutdown. This works great with tuxonice-sources and splashutils.
Each time "funtoo" starts, I feel save and home. This is my machine, it looks good and works even better.
Maybe somebody else wants his/her machine to fit exactly his/her requirements. Then You may want to have a look at tuxonice-sources.

6SigmaFM
Predictive DCIM
The modern datacenter can often house hundreds of racks or cabinets containing thousands of servers, with changes often happening daily. Once installed equipment will often be required to be available 24/7 with little or no opportunity to power it down to change the configuration. Combine this with the ever-increasing power densities of the IT equipment, and it can represent an ever-present risk of thermal failure with very limited possibilities for remedial actions.
6SigmaFM enables the datacenter operator to test proposed configurations in order to predict outcomes, so minimising the risk of failure and indeed of getting into this difficult to manage scenario. In addition, a comprehensive change history – including environmental impact and performance – is stored so past decisions can be revisited to help refine the decision process and better predict the future.
Once your Virtual Facility (VF) is up and running, you can easily: drag-&-drop new equipment into every cabinet and fill it to capacity; add or change cabinets in the model; move floor grilles around; or model almost any other everyday operation you wish do in your datacenter.
In-depth understanding
Gain a better perspective on your data center running your asset management operations within a 3D space.
Up to the minute information
Just like the asset management integration, 6SigmaFM works with Real-Time Monitoring Systems to provide the current status of your data center.
(see 3rd party integration page for more information)
Principal Uses
IT Demand Management
- Consider Installs, Moves, Uninstalls… to IT equipment considering space, power, cooling, network
and weight in choosing locations.
- Synchronize the virtual facility with other management tools by, for example, importing changes from
asset management tools, and use simulation to assess plans before deployment.
Capacity Management
- Use thermal simulations to reset cooling limits on cabinets as IT layout deviates from original
design loads.
- Export updated cooling limits back to IT asset management tools. o Modify layout of data-hall. o Add
or remove rows of racks and floor-tiles.
Design Upgrade
- Test effectiveness of proposed changes such as hot- or cold- aisle containment or cabinet-level
cooling before deployment.
- Test impact of new cable routes on airflow management before deployment.
- Consider changes to cooling strategies.
- Assess effects of different control strategies such as group control, control-on-supply or pressure
control.
- Test performance of a new ACU design such as EC fans in the floor void or variable-speed drives.
Trouble shooting
- Diagnose the cause of overheating equipment.
- Test potential fixes before deployment.
Facility Management
- Assess the impact of taking an ACU down for maintenance or simulate an ACU failure scenario.
- Identifying potential energy savings – for example, identify bypass air and ACU short-circuiting plus
test potential fixes before deployment.
- Periodically assess whether the facility is being overcooled and reconsider energy efficiency
measures that could be adopted.
- Test whether cooling set-points can be turned up to make cooling system more efficient without
compromising resilience.
Integrating Products
6SigmaFM integrates with other parts of the 6SigmaDCsuite to enable the simulation and assessment of various aspects of the facility before any changes are implemented:
6SigmaCooling – 6SigmaDC CFD solver for prediction of thermal conditions and airflow paths;
6SigmaRack – pre-test IT layout inside a cabinet;
6SigmaPower – power configuration and SPOF analysis;
6SigmaWeight – check loading on the raised floor;
6SigmaRoom – major design changes to the infrastructure of the facility;
6SigmaITM – (primarily for IT managers) view rooms being managed by 6SigmaFM to enable effective
separation of tasks and responsibilities and raise Change Requests (CRs) in order to service them.
Typical CR actions include:
- Adding and removing items from the Store Room;
- Installing, decommissioning or moving, equipment around a facility;
- Changing one item for another;
- General maintenance.

Last week gold dropped like a NASA satellite falling from space. What was the driving force of this drop?
Last week December gold opened the week at $1,820 and closed the week at $1,639.80. The weakness in the market was very clear if you were watching the COT report week to week. Before I cover the COT, look at the daily chart below to see the technicals. We see ADX now at 33 reflecting a strengthening downtrend. You can see how the very strong uptrend that started back in early July started weakening mid-August after gold touched $1,900 for the first time. MACD is showing momentum building in the move down with increasing divergence and Stochastics are deeply oversold. Not concerned about this as ADX is at 33 and rising. You also can see the large drop in Open Interest. So who is responsible for this large drop? Let’s have a look.
Proceed to Page 2 for the latest COT Data...
COT Data
Looking at the weekly chart below you can see that back on Aug. 5 Commercials on the old legacy COT report were 287,634. As of this past Friday, Sept. 23 Commercials came in at 197,628 contracts net-short. That shows liquidation at just over 90,000 contracts. As you know from reading Market Pulse, I prefer the newer Disaggregated COT report. And here is why.
On Aug. 5, Producers (true commercials) had a net-short position of -195,940 contracts. On Sept. 23, Producers were net-short -181,944 contracts. Managed money back on Aug. 5 was net-long 228,824 contracts. This past Friday managed money came in at 151,425 net-long. A much larger drop in longs than producers drop in shorts. So who exactly was liquidating on the other side of managed money? You guessed it, our friends the Swap Dealers. Back on Aug. 5 Swap Dealers were -91,693 contracts net-short. This past Friday, Sept. 23 Swaps came in at -15,684 contracts net-short. This is the lowest we have seen since late 2008.
So you want to know when gold will drop it’s free fall? Keep an eye on the Swap Dealers because when they start adding to their net-shorts again, that is when we will see price rise. And if they continue liquidating, we definitely can see gold test $1,500.00..

U.S. stocks advanced as equity markets in the world’s largest economy reopened after Hurricane Sandy caused the longest weather-related shutdown since 1888.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1 percent from Friday’s close to 1,413.83 at 9:31 a.m. in New York. The benchmark gauge has declined 2 percent in October after four straight months of gains.
“Investors are braced for an exceptionally busy open, as three days of trading are combined into one,” Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in London, wrote in an e-mail. “There is the additional feature of some likely window-dressing business, given today being the last trading day of the month and the end of the year for many mutual funds. There has been some encouraging economic data in the form of house prices.”.
Backup Power
Internet and mobile-phone connections were limited on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as U.S. equity markets prepared to open after the longest weather-related shutdown in more than a century. The NYSE’s headquarters are running on backup power and will keep using it if necessary all week, Larry Leibowitz, the chief operating officer, said in a phone interview.
Data yesterday showed the S&P/Case-Shiller Index of property values in 20 cities rose 2 percent in August from a year earlier, after a 1.2 percent advance in July. The average estimate by economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a 1.9 percent increase.
A report today may reveal business activity in the U.S. expanded in October. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.’s business barometer rose to 51 from 49.7 last month, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 54 economists. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction.
Economic Data
The Labor Department is striving to issue its monthly report on employment on Nov. 2 as scheduled, a spokesman said yesterday. Payrolls increased by 125,000 workers in October and the jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent, according to the median forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The jobs report is the last before the Nov. 6 presidential election, and may help sway voters trying to decide between giving President Barack Obama another four years in office or to change course with Republican challenger Mitt Romney.
Investors are also watching corporate results. Some 24 companies in the S&P 500 are due to report earnings today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit has exceeded projections at 72 percent of companies to have released third- quarter results, while sales trailed estimates at 60 percent of firms, Bloomberg data show.
Hurricane Sandy may reduce economic output by $25 billion in the fourth quarter, according to Gregory Daco, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. That could lower the fourth-quarter pace of growth to between 1 percent and 1.5 percent, from an estimate of 1.6 percent, he said.

Leapfrog Tag - the latest in teaching children to read
Leapfrog make reading interactive with the use of a Tag pen to help read the book and play games. Your child can hold the pen and touch a symbol on the page to read the story to them by the characters in the book, with a signalling sound to tell them when to turn the page. Alternatively they can touch another symbol to have just that page read to them. To aid understanding and memory there are games within the story asking kids to find favourite characters or demonstrate their understanding by pointing to parts of the picture when asked a question.
The stories are cute and the characters are colourful and fun.
In the Ozzie and Mack story I tested, the tale is followed by a series of learning games. There is an alphabet page when pounces the letters and gives examples of words starting with the individual letters. In Ozzie's Rhyme Time Band the kids can point to ryhming words which are read out loud to them. The game that goes with this page asks kids to find words as they are read to them. Tree House Telephone shows children how adding the letter 'e' to words changes them - for example, not to note. River roundup explains more complicated words like a mini dictionary. On each of the game pages there are 3 levels - children work their way through each level. Because the Tag stores what your children have played so far, they can only move up a level once they have mastered the previous one.
The Tag system comes with a CD which loads a program connecting your Tag pen to programs on the Leapfrog website. Here you can dowload stories and receive rewards for using the Tag Reading system. I'm not sure what the rewards are - as clearly I didn't play long enough with my TAG to earn any!!!
I started off unsure about the Tag reading system - as I'm very much one for natural parenting and I'd prefer to play these games with the kids myself rather than relying on technology. However, as I played with the Leapfrog Tag I could see how useful it could be for busy families. These days not everyone has enough time to teach kids to read, or maybe can't think up enough entertaining games to play with the kids to help them. I also know that some kids are very reluctant to be shown what to do by an adult, but are quite happy to sit by themselves learning from this type of technology.
I wasn't enamoured by the internet part of the product and was concerned about entering personal data into yet another website - even though I was assured this was intended to help construct an age appropriate learning plan. I thought the product was good enough on its own not to need the rewards element on the website. It's just a personal opinion, but I really don't think we need to use the internet for everything - including learning how to read.
On balance, my concerns are purely personal and for what it is setting out to do, the Leap Frog does succeed. It's easy for children to understand and very easy to use. The stories are well laid out and beautifully illustrated. The games are well thought through for the intended age range of 4 - 8 years old - though you could start kids on these books earlier than that. I like the fact that there are levels of games to play and so the book continues to be useful as the child reading progresses.
The Leapfrog Tag system can be bought at Amazon for £33.99 and includes your first Tag book.
There are more Tag books available from £11.10 on Amazon and include some favourite characters such as Spongbob Square Pants, Cat in the Hat and Kung Fu Panda. A selection is here at Amazon:

Tell me my mother: Stories of Campbelltown’s Aboriginal Women
Campbelltown Arts Centre
ISBN: 978-1-875199-55-6
“Stories of resilience and inspiration” is how I would sum up this collection of oral histories with 15 local Aboriginal women residing in the Campbelltown District. They are stories that resolve issues for each of these women, and help the younger generations understand the lives we are fortunate to have today.
Many stories revolve around the history of the local areas these women have come from across the State and even Victoria, and life under the Protection Act including mission life, as well the negative effects of alcohol and domestic violence on the family. But most stories end with life today in Campbelltown and the roles the women play in community activities such as the street patrols Gladys Lock is part of.
The stories are about reconciling the past for these women. Marnie Williamson says, “Reconciliation must begin within ourselves. As elders, we must strive to reconcile our own past, somehow make sense of it, or we’ll always live in this voice, shadows in our own land.” And in trying to reconcile such stories of hardship, the women also recall the funnier side of life and growing up, such as the first time Verna Barker saw a plane and how she screamed thinking it was aliens coming to get her.
I was astounded at the size of the families that some of these women raised and continue to raise. Jenny Brown had four kids of her own but raised another 600 foster kids, while Christina Craig has 93 grand kids.
Some stories were also interesting local histories such as Glenda Chalker’s entry about living at Pheasant’s Nest, which is named PN because it’s the first place lyrebirds were recorded at. The Lyrebird is also Glenda’s totem, so she feels especially at home at Pheasant’s Nest. I’ll remember that when next I drive to Canberra along the M5.
Most women had key messages for their children and for all young people. Sue Davis’ message was that we should respect one another, respect culture and respect ourselves. In line with that Kylie Dickson believes that “to earn respect, you’ve got to give respect”. Artist and painter Sue Grant advises that you should follow your spirit and your dreams and be proud. And Julie Hoffmanbeck’s words to her children and other parents are “The most important thing is protecting you and your kids.”
Judy McKay recommends taking one day at a time, enjoying a sunset or a sunrise, the birds chirping, and the smells around you. And to never lose the little child inside.
Some of the stories are about achievement for these women, and that is measured in different ways. For Norma Layt her greatest achievements in life were going to uni, buying her own home and bringing up seven children. I would’ve thought one of those would be enough!
The book is really about the role of the mother and other key women in our lives and Alana Moffatt talks about the guidance and knowledge she got from her Mimi (grandmother) and how that’s where her drive stems from.
Each short autobiographical narrative is complimented by a beautiful black and white portrait by Mervyn Bishop.
Finally, Ruby Langford Ginibi says she tells her stories to make things change and to make people wake up. And this collection of truly hard lives lived, by women who are not bitter or twisted, but who are full of love and compassion should really make some of our young people wake up to themselves and see that what they enjoy today is a far cry from what our old people had to endure.
This is an inspirational read about women, many whom were born in dire conditions and raised without the basic human right we enjoy today. Show them you appreciate their generosity of spirit to tell their stories by reading them, and in turn you will show and that they deserve a place, as Mona Porter says, “My philosophy is that in the world, it doesn’t matter who you are, where you are or where you are from, you deserve your place in this world.”
This small volume is a gift to the Campbelltown community by these women, through the Campbelltown Arts Centre who coordinate the Campbelltown Intergenerational Aboriginal Project, through which this book was completed.

Hurray for Castiel luvers!!! ;3
Anything you wanna talk about?
Do you talk to people in Humphrey Poptart's chat thread? It's a really nice bunch of people and I think you'd get bumps from them even with a modest tank of 17 fish. And free advice.
I wish more booty grab players would do as you do -- bump for every grab. Just one bump makes a world of difference to a tank owner trying to recoup the cost of fish.
Except, I stalk people too ;P Then I figure after I find out all their interests are similar to mine, I fantasize about our should-be life together.
Sorry, I know I'm weirder than you ;P

Let me digress briefly: I am not a scientist; I have however, done research on this theory and have written articles about it and participated in a colloquium in February 2009 in Atlanta titled “Weather or Not” sponsored by and as a member of Mensa.
For those who are still reading this, I don’t have to bore you with data, statistics or even hockey sticks to remind you of some very basic science. CO2 is a byproduct expelled from our lungs during the breathing process. Plants then breathe in the carbon dioxide in order to expel oxygen for us to breathe; this process is called photosynthesis. CO2 is also created by manmade activities such as the combustion of carbon containing hydrocarbons in fuels or wood. It is also used to make our soft drinks fizzle, fire extinguishers put out fires and you may also recognize it in solid form as dry ice.
The reason for my grievance manifests itself when I hear so-called scientists, who receive taxpayer subsidized government grants, and politicians staking claim on more of our money in order to combat this most dangerous of gases. There is not one shred of genuine scientific data that proves the theory of global warming. Nor is there consensus in the scientific community.
There has been a lot of inaccurate and purposefully skewed data offered up as proof, but it has been discredited by genuine scientific data and historical records. One does not have to know much about science to realize that while CO2 is colorless and odorless, something indeed looks and smells rotten.
If you have followed the political path of this topic, you know what I mean. However, I will concede this; carbon dioxide does indeed become dangerous as soon as politicians open their mouth.

Fallout New Vegas Recommended System Requirements
Steamworks digital platform (Games for Windows is the certification)
Operating System: XP, Vista, Windows 7
Processor: Dual Core 2Ghz (enhanced for multi-core)
Video Card: Nvidia GeForce 6 Series or similar (ATI 1300 minimum)
Memory: 2GB
Hard Disc Space: 10GB
You will notice that above the system requirements image is the question and answer taken from the Official FAQ. As part of the answer they state that these requirements are the recommended.
Now it seems to us that these recommended requirements are pretty low. Admittedly the game engine came out a couple of years back, Fallout 3. We will get in touch with our contact and double check this and report back.
-----------
Ok, we have had word and these requirements are actually the "required" system specs. So it will make sense that this means we are looking at the Fallout New Vegas minimum system requirements

SNK Arcade Classics Volume One takes some of you back to the arcade games between 1990 and 1996. The rest will take a good look at what games look back eleven to seventeen years ago. This collection has 16 games (which is a lot of games), including favorites such as Samurai Showdown, Metal Slug, and...more

i am a bit late knowing the FF series. I think FF X and FF XII are the best series in the game. It's the only reason i still appreciate my PS2 console.

Final Fantasy is the only reason I have a PS2, haven't got XII yet but I'm still happily playing Wario Smooth Moves and Wii Sports so the PS2 is sitting unused for now.
Another reason that there are no FPS is that as most games are sold on the PS2... FPS's on PS2 suck harder than a $10 whore, the only decent one on there was..... was..... I'm struggling.... certainly wasn't Killzone....
Every country has its differing sales charts, preferences are varied but of course the mass charts do not account for everybody's taste within that region. Lots of folk in the UK (myself included) love fps games. The uneducated views of people from elsewhere are merely false assumptions !
[quote]FPS's never do good in UK. The violence tolerant level is lower there than in north america.[/quote] What?!?!?!?! FPS games do very well in the UK and the only reason none are in the top 10 is because the FPS market has been dry for so long. Wait until Stalker comes out, that'll go straight to the top.
gd gd final fantasy beats the rest and rightly so ..fifa 07 good.. evolution soccer 6 nice to see still there... sega megadrive collection i was expecting at no.2 but fair enough ... and mario still hanging in there.. nice collection of games in the charts this week
'Violence tolerance is lower there'?. Have you ever actually been or met anyone from the UK?. I'd love to see some proof to back-up such a ridiculous claim. FPS's don't sell well in the UK because most of the time they're only released on PC's and PC gaming in the UK is fringe at the extreme (with the exception of the sims franchise). I also don't believe that Crackdown sold because of the Halo 3 beta. I believe it sold because of over-rated media hype and the fact that since the (middling-success) title of Lost Planet there really hasn't been any significant releases on the console since November (GoW).
I dont see what the big deal is with all those final fantasy games. They are all the same and I find them all very boring. On another note it is true that Crackdown will sell well just because of the Halo 3 demo. That is one smart move by Microsoft. I cant wait until Halo 3 come out!
final fantasy 12 is cool, but i cant seem to get into it as i used to with rpgs. and the only reason crackdown sold so high is cuz the halo 3 demo...cant wait till that comes out
FPS's never do good in UK. The violence tolerant level is lower there than in north america. Props to square enix, for making such a sick game.
Yes well done to all the clever Final Fantasy players. I spend most of my free time on it at the moment. Today is the only day I haven't played it, I can feel my hand moving to the controller now... I am level 25, wasted loads of LP :( My only criticism of the whole game is when epensive gambit slots appear on the licence board getting in the way of progress. I really don't need them! Lol @ the Tomato Bandit guy, when I first got to that bit I tried to kill the T-rex thing as well. I hit it and saw it take off 0 damage, I ran like hell but it killed me. Annoyingly I hadn't yet saved it so I had to start from the beginning.
I Bought this game, its awesome. I have bought nearly all of the FFX Games on the PS2 and they have all been fun to play. So far im on the part i have to go out side the city to destroy the Tomoto Bandit lol. :D
I salute each and every person responsible for getting FF12 to the top spot. *salutes* I made sure I bought it on day of release, and haven't stopped playing it since.
I don't think there was quite this much hate for Sony when the PS2 came out though, the competition was Dreamcast who'd sort of made all the mistakes that Sony are making now.... Sega were fond of quoting "up to 6 billion players" and then didn't release a decent on line game for over a year, Sony has just dumped rumble, backward compatability, Dualshock pads that everyone loved, and added a huge price tag and a blu-ray player that not everyone wants.
ragrdoll21 said . "------ yeah i agree but things were differet then, ps2 didn't have any real competition. xbox didn't come untill later and when it did it was more expensive and had far fewer games on it while the gamecube..........well it was a gamecube. now however the tables have turned and sony really need to get their act together and stop hoping that customers are still going to buy their console despite their common sense and rattional thinking telling them otherwise. sony actually have to work to be successfull this time around, both the 360 and the wii are amazing machines.

i loved Bad Boys 1
"PS3 will never replace the PS2" Remember people saying that about the PS1 when the PS2 was launched, boy were they wrong.
PS3 can never replace the PS2 because the attitude Sony has now is different and that is causing a negative effect. Haters have increased, websites are taking the mic, websites are constantly posting bad info after bad info etc. Never happened to the PS2.
kavadias1981 ''The PS3 will never replace the PS2. Just look at the charts for chrissake!'' Yep, Sony sure have the long term intention of investing more in the PS2 than the PS3 to keep it alive for longer don't they ?
Final Fantasy has made a triumphant come back after the disappointing Final Fantasy 10 and 11. It's so streamlined and accessible to play, great to look at and the voice acting is a lot stronger too. Finally, the UK chart is representing our taste in games. I would love to see the back of FIFA, Need For Speed and The Sims for good but thats not going to happen any time soon :(. It's good to see Sega Mega Drive Collection in the top ten still as well as New Super Mario Bros but the chart is missing a few titles. I would like to know the position of Okami and where it stands in sales as well as Gears Of War. :D But finally, the charts are finally looking like they should do!
By random battles I meant that you can be running along a road nicely and suddenly you find yourself in a battle against 1,2,3,etc creatures that appear as if from nowhere. I did not mean fighting against something on a different screen or whether the outcome was random. It always annoys when you can be travelling from place to place and the game decides you have to fight now, if you run away from the battle 20-30 seconds has passed, so you run away and carry on your journey for another few seconds and wallop... another battle. So despite travelling over clear plains or an empty road suddenly there are creatures around that want a scrap. I've lost count of the number of times travelling from one village or location to another takes 30 minutes because the game decides you should have a scrap.
For those who do not know in FF XII you can see the monster and you fight on the same screen so if u get into a fight u can run away with no hassle IT IS NOT RANDOM thoughg the place where the monster summon and how many are in that spot is random.
TTDog, no it does not have random battles...
Had heard that the story is FF12 falls away a little, due to the bloke in charge of the story itself leaving halfway through development to work on Blue Dragon. I'm assuming FF12 still includes the "Random Battle" element that has put me off playing them too much in the past.
I might pick final fantasy xii
I knew it would sell well, its a great game. Wonder how well it went in Australia.
Good to see that Final Fantasy XII is being recieved so well in the UK.
Only one game in that list deserved to be there, and it got the top spot too. Nice going Square Enix.
Go Final Fantasy XII!
Bad Boys 2? They just got that game now?
yes Crackdown does come with halo3 mp beta over here however i didn't think crackdown was an amazing game it had a really good idea but i just found it a bit boring with no storyline. i can totally see why FF XII outsold crackdown its a better game plus there are still probably at least 10 ps2s to every 360 so the install base is huge. i don't think it was ever going to be the other way round.
this just proves that no matter how good the graphics and no matter how many explosions in however high definition, a good story is always going to sell the games. FF XII is just a very well done overall package.
Bad Boys 2 in the top ten?????? What's really going on in the UK?
FFXII beat Crackdown and FIFA? Guess the stereotype of soccer (football)being above all else only goes for part of the year. One question that I do have though is did the Crackdown come with Halo 3 multiplayer tryout like here? Also, Bad Boys in the top 10? How does that work?
BAD BOYS 2???
No Gears? Thats surprising.
Great to see Final Fantasy atop the charts. Also, how on earth can anyone call Final Fantasy chav-like? I mean, are the fanboys THAT deluded and they would convince themselves that FF appeals to chavs and that's the only way it could top the charts? Please, you people are sad. Final Fantasy topped that chart because it is a great game.
I'm really glad FFXII is being received well, despite all the flak it's been receiving about it's licence/gambit system, and well the game itself. I know that Dirge of Cerberus tanked, but I really hope that this game joins its predecessors (all ps1 ff games from seven (i think it starts with 7) on is in the top ten for the ps1 ranks. How mad is that?) in the halls of glory. And it's nice to note that today its 19 out of all the games in the database... makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, even though I had a few reservations about it. Keep it up Square, because I'm gettin my ps3 just for XIII and versus!
bad boys!!!!!! woooooooooo!!!
I see crackdown dropping way down after this week. All of my friends bought crackdown because they were too late signing up on-line. Now the freaking game is collecting dust.
Bad Boys 2? Lol, that game is old and has been for sale brand new for $9.99 since it came out. I'm glad FFXII is number #1, I'm sick of seeing Gears at number all theII

The new trailer for Transformers: Fall of Cybertron certainly isn't one of those irritating clips where you get half the story in 90 seconds. Like the game, this video jumps straight into the action at the conclusion of the predecessor - so if you can discern much from the clip other than “badass giant robots are giant and badass,” more power to you indeed. Well, there's also the strong implication that the game will have plenty of varied robot-annihilation and look just fine while doing it, which is always nice – and the clip's most useful fact, an August 28 release date for the game.
If this video's left you with a few blank spots re: Fall of Cybertron, we've 15 things you need to know about the title. When we saw the last Transformers: Fall of Cybertron trailer deconstructed by director Dave Tieger, he promised the game would take pains to have you caring deeply about giant brawling heaps of metal: does this clip bring a lump to your throat, or will you be requiring a little more persuading?

Marvel Avengers: Battle For Earth Review
In recent months, it’s been more apparent than ever that popular culture is hell bent on eating itself
In recent months, it’s been more apparent than ever that popular culture is hell bent on eating itself. It’s a never-ending glut of movies based on toys, toys based on books, books based on TV shows and games based on all of the above. Movie game tie-ins are often derided as the most soulless of this sorry bunch, and while Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth doesn’t entirely fly in the face of preconceptions, it at least attempts to. That’s got to count for something when it could have just contented itself as the next in line to an endless procession of bloated and bland gaming cash cows.
Though created to tie in with the film franchise, Battle for Earth takes the majority of its cues directly from the comic books, specifically the 2008 ‘Secret Invasion’ story arc by Brian Michael Bendis and Leinil Yu. Using Kinect’s motion-based controls, players can control up to 20 characters from the Marvel universe as they try to halt a global invasion by shape-shifting alien race, the Skrull. Disguised Skrull sleeper agents have also infiltrated the ranks of Earth’s mightiest heroes, a premise that gives this brightly coloured brawler the perfect excuse to pit good guys against other good guys and the bad guys against, well, everyone.
Though the game clearly has respect and affection for the source material, the campaign mode isn’t afforded much in the way of a story. Despite the wealth of inspiration to draw from, only a few still comic book panels and lines of voiceover tie stages very loosely together. The main attraction is the core gesture-based combat, and luckily there are plenty of additional modes to complete, a versus and co-op feature that allows you to play with or against friends, and costumes and collector’s cards to unlock. The fighting itself is surprisingly satisfying at first. Each character has three unique moves that can be strung together to create combos, and performing these will fill a Special gauge that can then be used to initiate breakers and powerful Ultra moves.
There are some nice touches, such as shouting character-specific phrases during an Ultra sequence to receive damage boosts, but the problem that quickly becomes apparent is that the heroes are essentially tactically identical, with any complexity in their unique actions and Kinect’s ability to recognise them providing the only real variation and challenge in the entire experience. Having so few unique attacks per character simply highlights this issue, and though individual matches are well paced, the campaign soon becomes a tiresome, repetitive and gimmicky slog. There are plenty of good ideas in Battle For Earth, but it’s clear that it has been restricted in what it can offer and ultimately accomplish by its very nature as a motion-based fighter.
Though an overall shallow affair, Marvel Avengers: Battle For Earth displays lot more polish, flair and finesse than your average movie tie-in title, but like those Skrull impostors, it can’t escape its true, uglier nature for too long.

League of Legends changes Champion pricing and release schedule; 7800 IP Tier added
Today on the League of Legends site, Riot employee Hippalus discussed their company plans for changes to IP/RP prices and the champion release schedule. There's some big changes coming -- specifically to champion pricing, which will now have tiers where older champions will go down in price whenever a new champion is released. But lets start at the beginning...
Over the past few months, the rate of releasing champions has slowed. For 2013, Riot's goal is to release 14-17 new champions -- around one every three to four weeks. This not only gives their design team more time to polish each new champion, but it gives you more time to save IP in-between champion releases. That's good, because Riot is adding IP and RP price tiers, including a new 7800 IP tier. The tiers are:
To help you understand, there will be a price reduction schedule that Riot is implementing. All brand-new champions will cost 7800 IP/975 RP for the first week only, and will then be reduced to 6300 IP. This should help with everyone buying a new champion and dodging when they don't get to play it. Every time a new champion is released, the oldest 6300 IP/975 RP champion will be reduced to 4800 IP/880 RP -- the next lowest tier. In addition, with every third champion release, an additional champion currently priced at 4800 IP or lower will be reduced to the next lowest tier, based on age and ease of play.
Did you get all that?
To make it easier, Riot provided a Tl;dr:
In addition to all of this, the seven oldest 6300 IP champions are getting an immediate price reduction. These champions are Ezreal, Vladimir, Renekton, Nocturne, Lee Sin, Brand and Vayne. They are all reduced to 4800 IP/880 RP. If you bought these champions in the two weeks prior to today, Riot will automatically refund the difference for you.
I think the new changes are great. In fact, they're amazing, and the 7800 IP tier is genius for the first week. This is how you help deal with overpopulation of a champion at release.

Okamiden Review
Some games don’t get sequels, no matter how patiently we wait. We didn’t get another ICO, we didn’t get another Final Fantasy VII (though many of us are still hoping for a remake), and after playing Okamiden, the long-awaited handheld offshoot to one of Capcom’s most remarkable properties, gamers will find themselves waiting some more.
That’s not to say that Okamiden isn’t a good game. This handheld iteration is, if nothing else, amusing. But the overall package—the good, the bad, and the seriously ugly—is not as impressive as it might have been seven years ago when the Nintendo DS first came out.
For those who have barely touched their DS, this may not be much of a problem. Like the PS2 and Nintendo Wii original, Okamiden provides the player with complete access to a paintbrush tool (called the Celestial Brush) that can be used to color the world. But instead of spray-painting walls (as in Jet Set Radio), revitalizing decayed environments (as in Epic Mickey), or removing sludge/paint from the islands of Super Mario Sunshine, Okamiden allows you to attack, influence, and enhance the world with the simple stroke of a paintbrush.
Or, more specifically, the simple stroke of a finger or stylus across the bottom screen of the DS. This gameplay element makes Okamiden instantly cool, charismatic, and unmistakably irresistible. If you've never experienced anything like this before, you'll be won over for hours.
However, if you have played a game like this before (namely Okami, but either of the handheld Zelda games will do), Okamiden might come across as more of a chore than a work of art to be cherished.
In theory, the gameplay is remarkable. Players control a lone wolf, Chibiterasu, who just happens to be the descendant of Amaterasu. He’s quick, loyal, and has been placed in a world with a more immerse camera than The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. The camera is low and pleasantly angled behind Okamiden. But while it's possible to swing the camera around in games like N64 and Nintendo DS versions of the fifteen-year-old Mario 64, for example, there is no such feature available in Okamiden. Thus, when it’s time to backtrack, players will have to endure a stiff camera that makes it appear as if our four-legged friend is running toward the screen. Unfortunately, backtracking is as common in this game as lawsuits are at Activision, so you’ll be running toward the screen a lot.
But wait—now I need to backtrack. I was about to tell you why the gameplay was theoretically remarkable.
As with the N64, GameCube and Nintendo Wii versions of The Legend of Zelda, Okamiden allows you to battle in a world that’s wholly immerse and entirely in 3D. Jump, dodge enemies, launch simple combo attacks—all the staples of a good action/RPG are here. It’s very impressive to see these features, no matter how trivial, in a Nintendo DS game. The cel-shaded art style, which attempts to mimic the beauty of Okami, is even more impressive. Granted, Okamiden completely fails in this regard (the jagged edges and generic cartoon effects have been seen on the DS before). But this is old hardware, and you can tell that the developers put their hearts and souls into making the game look its best. If you haven’t played some of the system’s finer titles, Okamiden should qualify as a very beautiful game.
It seems that I have gotten sidetracked once more. Now I must backtrack to the gameplay, which, according to mathematical calculations that have yet to be proven (aka a “theory”), should be downright spellbinding. So why isn’t it?
Okamiden’s developers (like most other developers) confuse backtracking and rehashing with gameplay length. Have you ever noticed that the longer an RPG is, the more you have to backtrack? Meanwhile, short action games tend to feature very few moments where you have to retread old environments. This is not a coincidence, and it's a glaring flaw that severely detracts from Okamiden’s potential and appeal.
It is not uncommon for players to go out of their way to step on a switch, only to walk back several steps (or feet) to flip another switch, and then be forced to return to the first one. We've done it before, and any interest that was once there is definitely gone by now.
Aside from the mission-specific moments, when a Crazy Taxi-style arrow is used to point us in the right direction, players are required to journey without any helpful hints. In a larger, more open-ended world, this might be acceptable. But Okamiden isn’t exactly a non-linear adventure. There are obstacles (physical and magical) that will keep players from wandering too far outside current path. The problem is, within these confines is a land full of boring characters that must be spoken to and tiring environments that must be revisited in order to trigger the next step.
Frankly, Okamiden is a game that should have done better. Yes, Okami had its share of repetitive moments, but it also featured one of the most compelling presentations of any game of its time. It was a unique alternative to Zelda. Okamiden is not.
If this review has advertised Okamiden as a bad offshoot, then it should be noted that my comments come more from disappointment than anything else. There are some players who will undoubtedly love Okamiden, either because the flaws (such as backtracking) are not as familiar or because they have the capacity to overlook its myriad mistakes. I wish I could do the same.

de Blob 2 Impressions
Everyones favorite Blob comes splattering onto all major consoles this time around.. No, what's so weird is that the game alternates between being childishly charming and almost aggravatingly difficult.
In the original Wii exclusive a lot of this difficulty was due to the motion controls which, while not badly done, complicated matters just enough to really screw you up at the worst of times. But the level design in this game is so deceptively simple that the game is an absolute terror if you aren't incredibly patient and navigating carefully. But the core of the gameplay has been much tightened up since the last game, making the process of playing this game much less hair pulling.
Of course some of this is probably helped by the fact that the game is being released on the Xbox 360 and PS3. For those of us that just aren't very good at using the motion controls this comes as quite the blessing although there are sure to be Wii fans (if those still exist) that will cry foul at the loss of a console exclusive. The non-Wii versions are quite responsive thanks to all the actions being mapped to controller inputs allowing for rapid, easy movement around the levels although we weren't able to test out a Wii controlled version of the title sadly.
Everything has improved in de Blob 2 over the first one. The missions are more expansive, the game is more challenging and there are varied obstacles to deal with. With the painting being just as engaging as in the previous title this is more or less a must own for anyone who was a fan of the previous entry.
Climbing the various towers in the demo while defeating the "cops" that were trying to stop us, avoiding the water (which washes away all of your paint) and trying to not accidentally break barrels containing black paint (which undoes your hard work) was quite the enjoyable little trial. The time limit is a pressing concern but not so much so that it feels oppressive, providing an impetus to move quickly but not punishing you if you fall short of perfection. Even when being forced to dodge water and enemies while mixing paints the objectives never become so obscure that you can't suss out what you're supposed to be doing.
Look for de Blob 2 to hit store shelves rather soon, splattering all over the place this February in all regions. Prepare to paint, smash and crash your way across the landscape when this title hits all major consoles, including the Nintendo DS.

In the Garden:
Middle South
July, 2003
Regional Report
Tender baby zucchini deserve to be gathered daily, preferably early in the morning when they are at their best.
Those Crazy Cucurbits
The season is here for following the zucchini diet, which involves eating them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But zukes aren't alone in showing their zest for life. There are butternuts tumbling out of my compost, cucumbers rambling beneath my tomatoes, and it's time to plant pumpkins, too. Cucurbits love the summer garden, so it only makes sense to love them back.
Planting Replacements
Whether they are zucchinis, yellow crooknecks, pattypans, or acorns, the summer squash that are filling your harvest basket now won't last forever. Squash borers often take the plants down, or they may simply exhaust themselves. This being the case, why not sow some more plants for late-season harvest? I like to start a few seeds indoors and set them out in late July or early August.
Research from the University of Georgia shows that young summer squash plants, less than three weeks old, produce just as well as direct-seeded crops. And starting seeds indoors often is simpler than keeping them adequately supplied with water in the garden.
Pretty Pumpkins
If you want to grow some pumpkins for fall harvest, there's an easy way to get the plants up and growing. Prepare a furrow for the seeds, dampen it well, lay in a few seeds, and then cover them with an inch of compost or potting soil. Then cover the seeded area with a board for a few days. Because the soil atop the seeds is not watered, it will not form a crust, and the seedlings should pop right through as soon as you remove the board.
Use newspapers or old cardboard to mulch around your pumpkins. Between the paper mulch and the plants' large leaves, weeds will be kept in check. I like to grow small-fruited pumpkins like 'Baby Bear', which produce lots of fruits and require less care than varieties that produce huge fruits.

October, 2011
Regional Report
This bed of fall greens is simply awaiting its portable cold frame.
Planting Fall Crops
The cold weather is coming on fast, and I can't stand the idea of giving up my Swiss chard, mustard greens, and lettuce that are thriving right now. So I'm hauling out the cold frame. I still have some small Chinese cabbages and endive also, so I'm going to protect them and see how they go through the winter.
Plant Greens Now and Again in February
Although some gardeners swear they can keep salad greens growing in a cold frame all winter, we can't grow much past end of November in our area since the days are too short to store up enough heat. However, we can start again in mid-to-late February for the early spring greens.
Cold Frame Worth the Effort
I'm always on the lookout for ways to push both ends of the gardening season, and I've had pretty good luck with cold frames. Even if an occasional plant is lost to frost, succulent greens for salad in late fall make a cold frame well worth the extra gardening effort.
Portable Cold Frames Easy to Move
I bought a used cold frame last spring, and it is very portable. I can pop it over anything I want to save. It was built out of plywood with rails to hold two storm window panels and is quite sturdy. I plan to leave it in the garden over the winter. I'm sowing lettuce, mustard, and mixed Asian greens in flats to put in the cold frame. I've left enough room to put in jugs of warm water on the coldest nights, and I plan to bank the sides with bales of straw. I know the greens will not get to full size, but as long as they grow somewhat, I can cut them for a tender salad or stir fry.
Cloches and Bell Jars Work on a Smaller Scale
If you don't have a cold frame, you can use smaller scale season extenders such as cloches and hotcaps. These are bottles or caps to slip over individual plants that allow you to extend the growing season three or four weeks on each end. Traditional cloches such as the beautiful bell jars of French intensive gardening are quite expensive, so it usually makes more sense to use the plastic or paper ones that are readily available commercially or to recycle your own milk jugs.
Disposable Covers
You can purchase simple plastic covers that are meant to be discarded after the season is over or more elaborate ones such as the plastic sleeves with water-filled tubes that surround the plant with insulation, called Wall-O-Water. I also used my Wall-O-Waters last spring to protect my tomatoes from the late cold snap we had.
With a little extra effort, you really can have fresh greens for the Thanksgiving table and perhaps even for the December holidays. Besides, what can it hurt? It's only seeds.

hi tinker, hope the dog recovers soon, has it eaten something it doesn't normally
Hi guys, great final of scd thoroughly enjoyed that, a good evenings entertainment, thought the final three all deserved their places and couldn't call the result after the final dances, Hi Jean that jasmine is so close to flowering, as brucie would say keep on misting.
Afternoon forkers "big shop" done, Ouch££££!. Great tree Dean, love the dolls Bjay, very festive conservatory jean, Haven't a clue on the choccie so will guess snowflake , spent a few hours this morning doing the nearest I get to cooking which was starting off some homebrew, if all goes well 5 gallons of fine irish stout will be ready to enjoy sitting out on those long warm summer evenings next year. (I know but we can all dream).
I always lose my car Jo, I'm partially colour blind which doesn't help so an RNLI pennant adorns it's aerial. Looking forward to relaxing watching SCD
sounds lovely, my dream is to move to somewhere more rural, Sadly the wildlife where I am tend to wear hoodies.
if there on your pc click on the oak tree symbol, this should guide you thro finding and uploading them into your post
Aye funny things animals, we don't often associate them with having feelings or emotions but I know from the dogs I've been fortunate enough to have that they definitely do, they have a sense which knows when your coming home, when your sad etc, my old german shepherd supposedly a big tough dog would cry and howl like a baby when I went to work, I used to joke with the missus that she loved me more than she did . I fear were maybe getting a bit morose and apologies if I've been party to that but that story did upset me so as I've now finished work for christmas let's lighten the mood who's organized, zippy has a tree in a plastic bag, Jo or at least I think it's jo has three rings on her hob and were off tommorrow for the "big shop" ouch I fear my wallet will take a bashing.
Just read the story about the poor dog in China, staying with its mate how touching is that, brought a tear to my eye,
Hi Guys, nice to be back in the warmth, just drying out as I have been absolutely soaked through today, It's not stopped here today, some more wonderful trees and decorations on show well done everyone, noted the comment on the coke truck which made me smile as we always think christmas has arrived when that advert is shown, the truck was given to me a few years back by someone who has sadly passed away now and I've never seen another like it, it has flashing lights all over the trailer and has become a cherished part of our decorations. Off for some tea and a noggin of something warming.
Thanks verdun, I'll hopefully try this out too, thanks for the advice.

suggestion on converting an outdoor cat to an indoor cat
#1
Posted 05 September 2012 - 08:52 PM
i won't keep it as an outdoor cat.
girl at work suggested finding where it's been going and bringing a sample home.
the only thing i can think of is some type of quarantine - no options situation.
#2
Posted 05 September 2012 - 08:57 PM
But, yeah, putting it in the box and scratching around a little is always the first step. Most cats are smart enough that they just get it, but if this has been an exclusively outdoor cat, then maybe it needs some coaching.
#3
Posted 05 September 2012 - 11:02 PM
maybe 4 - 6 weeks ago w/ one 1/2 + 1/2
#4
Posted 05 September 2012 - 11:25 PM
I tried it a couple of times and gave up, those bastards sat at my door meowing all night to go out, then to come in, then to go out......... It's not worth alcoholism and mental issues IMO, send the cat packing and start fresh.
Good luck
#5
Posted 06 September 2012 - 02:28 PM
so this morning i go to set up a barrier so the cat couldn't stay in the living area, didn't want any part of that - kept thorwing itself at the thing until it gave way - only to bolt outside when i went to leave.
the cat lady suggested keeping it in a dog pen until it figured out the whole box thing - wtf does everyonehove a spare dog pen laying around ?
anywho i think i've got something figured out, but if that lil f'r would just use the damn box, he'd get free run of the place.

#17
Posted 20 September 2012 - 11:55 PM
does this mean you are keeping him, dave?
hope so...
if you can put something he can hang out on next to a window, so he can look outside and sunbathe, he would probably like that
they sell little hammocks that you can attach to the sill but just a chair and a pillow or towel works, too
maybe put some catnip nearby to encourage him to use it
if you have any kitty-poppa questions, post em and we can help!
#18
Posted 21 September 2012 - 03:28 PM
might be having some upper GI issues, but since i have no idea what his diet was - garbage/dry food/critters ?- hopefully they are just related to changes.
since he was out for so long, i was planning to go to the vet anyway - so i'll just move up the plan.
for now he had to go back into segregation -

i'm headed back out in a few hours, i'll see the results tomorrow
#21
Posted 22 September 2012 - 09:31 PM
and def, the transition from free-range food to other food can make them pukey...
also, if he sheds a lot, he can get hairballs from grooming which end up being puke torpedos
is he showing you affection yet?
i wanna see more pics
#22
Posted 23 September 2012 - 01:26 AM
Doesn't someone sell a converter for that?
that was my first thought
the second thought I had was that he needs some cool places to hang out, but apparently he found it.
There's this pretty cool show on Animal Planet called "My Cat From Hell." It's very interesting and informative... this cat behaviorist goes and helps people with their misbehaving cats.
Basically, cats just need lots of places to climb and hide and they like looking out the window.
If you play with the cat, you might see him more often. You could get one of those feather things on a string, or a laser... but I have mixed feelings on the laser. They love it but maybe a little too much. They seem to look for it long after you stop shining it... makes you feel bad.
I give mine catnip a lot... but for medical reasons
Oh and don't forget something to scratch on... otherwise it'll be something you love. They need to scratch for their nails.
#23
Posted 23 September 2012 - 04:35 PM
since day one - no problems petting, really likes getting brushed - not shedding, scrathes under the chin.
took to the scrathing post thing, chases the toys i put some treats in, has 2 wondow sills for looking out.
i also leave some treats on top of on old chest, on top of the scratch post or one of his hiding places.
not many just one or 2of those temptation things.
will be making vet appt tomorrow.
i met this guy years ago, helped w/ some strays and didn't charge my friend.
that seems like 100 years ago.
photos - will try, once i find the gdmf camera - maybe in the car, ????
i'm on the dl right now, jammed my left elbow preventing a fall - maybe the vet can check me out too ?

cat does not like to get put in the box.
are taping up the almost destroyed box from the first 2 attepmts, i did manage to get him out to the car.
where it took the first oppertunity to bolt.
there was a slight chase around the inside if the car, no damage to dashboard etc.
I still went to the vets office and found out they have someone there between 8:00AM and midnight ,7 days a week.
"just bring him in when you can".
cat was a no show all last night - untill 10:00PM anyway
when i went to leave this morning it was 50 degrees out, and the cat was back in the apt as fast as he left the car yesterday.
getting a real carrier today or tomorrow, but i might wait a few days before i try that again.
i have a wake i need to get to tonight, and may need to see dr. about the elbow
update -
hard carrier secured,

i might try to find a way to spring load the door and make it into a cat trap to use when i'm home.
once the door closes, i can be at the vet in less than 5 min.
he's pretty much keeping his distance from me right now, so it might be a few days.
#30
Posted 26 September 2012 - 01:49 PM
Like nancy said, you have to outsmart them. Let them eat safely in there for a few days or so... leave the thing with the door open so he can go in and out as he pleases, and then on the day you bring him to the vet you shut the door when he least expects it.
That worked for Poncho. Sometimes it even seemed as if she enjoyed being inside the carrier. She'd just go in there and lay down.

UPVC SUPPLIERS LTD ESKVALE & CLEVELAND LEAGUE
LEALHOLM won 2-0 at Boosbeck and Lingdale United overwhelmed Great Ayton 11-4 as league teams met in the North Riding Challenge Cup.
Staithes enjoyed a huge 9-0 win at Scalby to join them in going through but Loftus and Stokesley bowed out of the competition.
Lealholm scored twice in two first half minutes to move into the third round, with Darren Harland adding to Phil Brown’s opening goal.
Lingdale had to come from behind to beat Great Ayton, but it was pretty much one-way traffic once they hit top gear.
Anthony Jones scored four times while Wayne Skelton and Andrew Smith both grabbed a brace.
Shane Breckon, Michael Woodhouse and Luke Johnson also got on the scoresheet.
Staithes also spread their goals around as they dominated at Scalby. Chris Harland scored twice and Joe Gibson, James Rice, Ryan Thompson, Gary Gilding, Steve Starsmore, Simon Bowes and Ryan Gibson all chipped in.
Loftus went out in a 4-2 home defeat to well-organised Amotherby and Swinton, while Stokesley lost 4-1 on penalties at Redcar Newmarket following a 2-2 draw.
Jordan Smith and Martin Say scored for Loftus as they went into the final 15 minutes on level terms before being picked off.
Stokesley led 2-1 at Redcar Newmarket with 20 minutes to go but conceded an 87th minute equaliser and lost on penalties.
Brotton Railway Arms beat visiting Hollybush United 2-1 and Goldsborough United were 4-3 winners at Hinderwell in two closely-contested league games.

Bracewell feels foreign shores will benefit Gloucestershire
10:00am Saturday 23rd February 2013 in Gloucestershire Sport By SNJ Sport
JOHN Bracewell is confident that all the Gloucestershire players who have spent this winter abroad will benefit from hugely positive experiences.
Some members of the squad, including newcomer Gareth Roderick and Paul Muchall, have already returned to England to begin pre-season training.
Others, such as Ed Young, Ian Cockbain and Jack Taylor, are continuing to enjoy success with their club sides in Australia and New Zealand.
Bracewell said: "Players are starting to head back from their various winters in the sun. Gareth Roderick arrived from South Africa this week and Paul Muchall has returned from New Zealand.
"James Fuller gets back from New Zealand next week so the squad is starting to build up, although some of the lads who have stayed at home are taking a short break before the start of pre-season."
The highlight of Young's winter has been a T20 century. He blasted 106 off just 49 balls for his club side in Adelaide, much to the delight of Gloucestershire's Director of Cricket.
Bracewell added: "It's good to see that Ed has taken the initiative to get more batting by putting himself up to the top of the order in club cricket in Australia.
"That means he is getting to face the new ball and his position in our team often requires him to face the second new ball, so that is valuable experience.
"Ed is also getting in a lot of bowling and at different stages in an innings. I think he opened the bowling in the same match as he made his T20 century.
"We knew he had it in him to play that sort of innings. It was whether he was prepared to let it out.
"He is a lovely clean striker of a cricket ball, but has tended to soak up a few balls getting in. Obviously he has taken the bowlers on from the word go to get his T20 ton and proved to himself that he can do it."
Elsewhere, Gloucestershire players have been helping their winter sides to successful campaigns with good individual performances.
"A number of guys are going into finals with their respective teams," said Bracewell.
"Ian Cockbain got a hundred a couple of weeks back opening the batting for his club side, which was pleasing.
"It looks as though both Jack Taylor and Benny Howell are going to reach finals with their teams, which, while it might delay them coming back, will ensure they are involved in very competitive cricket right to the end of their winter trips.
"We want the ones not involved in finals back as soon as possible now and, whatever happens, none of the players currently abroad will miss any games at the start of our season.
"James Fuller's winter in New Zealand offered the bonus of being picked for Otago's T20 squad and, although we had to pull him from some games recently because of a knee problem, it was really no more than a precaution. "He also managed to get in a first class game and record his first ten-wicket haul in a game, which is great for his confidence."

Archivist preserves her place
Katherine Demrow
Age: 83
Community: Rural Janesville
Occupation: Retired
Family: Husband of 60 years, Ken Demrow; son, Steven Demrow, 59, of Algonquin, Ill.; daughter, Sharon Clark, 52, of rural Orfordville; and another son, the late William "Bill" Demrow
Hobbies: Golf
Books: Histories of the area written by others, including friends
Philosophy on life: If you're going to do something, do it well, not halfway.
Podcast Episode
JANESVILLE If Kay Demrow isn't at the Luther Valley Historical Society archiving or researching history, she's most likely in her home office doing the same thing.
"It keeps me busy and fills my life up a little bit more with meaning. I don't want to die in a rocking chair doing absolutely nothing," she said.
Odds are that won't happen.
Demrow is archivist, treasurer, newsletter editor and speaker for the society. During the past two years, she has volunteered 2,050 hours and logged more than 10,000 miles traveling between her rural Janesville home and the society in Footville.
Genealogies of Demrow's and her husband's families fill glass-encased bookshelves in their home office. On a card table and on other shelves, between her and her husband's desks and computers, are more historical census records, plat maps, diaries, church, town and cemetery records. She is working on them or already has indexed, transcribed, researched, organized and compiled them into booklets and books.
"The amount of her volunteer time is phenomenal. She is tireless, dedicated, driven and modest," said Margie Douglas Boylen, society president.
Demrow, who has survived two knee replacements and breast cancer and endured the deaths of a son and grandson, is direct. She also is hard working, a trait that was instilled in her at a young age as the oldest of five siblings growing up on the family farm.
After retiring and helping her father chart his family genealogy, Demrow got interested in history and began volunteering in 1991 at the society. Since then, the group's membership has grown from five to 200 members, she said.
Although her time spent collecting and preserving the history of Southwestern Wisconsin benefits others, it also fills an emptiness for Demrow since her son killed himself.
"That's one of the reasons why I do history—to keep my mind occupied," she said as tears pooled in her eyes.
Demrow was on her knees crawling from tombstone to tombstone in Center Cemetery doing historical society research the day her son died. Fourteen years later, she still hasn't gone back.
"I know he's gone, learned to live with it. But going back there brings back immediately the whole chain of events," Demrow said.
Still Demrow has never lost her intrigue with history that she believes must be preserved and shared.
"It's addictive to find out all the stuff," she said. "How can you go ahead if you don't know what happened in the lives of the people before you?"
Demrow also was instrumental in saving Rock County's property tax records, which are now stored in the basement tunnels of the courthouse.
For her efforts, she received the 2008 Governor's Award for Archival Advocacy and also was inducted into the Rock County Hall of Honor in 2007.
"I don't think I'm deserving of any of them," Demrow said. "To get an award for something I enjoy doing is redundant. I don't do it because I want to get an honor. I just like doing it. I was embarrassed."
Boylen said she is deserving.
"Rock County would not have the wealth of genealogy and historical records it does were it not for dedicated historians like Kay."

Ingalls fights hard, but doesn't advance at state volleyball tournament
Published 10/27/2012
By CONOR NICHOLL
Special to The Telegram
HAYS — The Ingalls High School volleyball team didn't make it out of pool play at the Class 1A, Division II state tournament Friday at Fort Hays State University's Gross Memorial Coliseum. However, Ingalls had plenty to be proud of - both with the season and its play Friday.
"We played as good as we could have," Ingalls coach Kim Batman said.
Ingalls went 1-2 in pool play and finished third behind perennial powerhouses Baileyville B&B and Wheatland-Grinnell. B&B is the No. 1 overall seed and defending state champion. Wheatland-Grinnell was state runner-up two years ago. Those teams qualified to Saturday's semifinals.
Still, Ingalls pushed those teams. The Bulldogs lost 25-20, 23-25, 25-12 to Wheatland-Grinnell in the day's first match and then defeated McPherson-Elyria Christian 25-14, 25-18. In its last match, Ingalls dropped the first set, 25-11, to B&B. At that point, even if Ingalls came back to win the match, it had virtually no chance to pass B&B and Wheatland-Grinnell on tiebreakers.
Still, the Bulldogs, with three seniors and three freshmen on the floor, rebounded to win the second set, 25-23.
"To come back and win the second match was just incredible," Batman said.
Then, it lost the third set, 23-15. Ingalls, the No. 4 seed, finished 31-11.
"I was really proud of them," Batman said. "They did awesome. ... I think we always thought we had the potential (to make state). It's just whether the chemistry was on on the day that we were playing. Because we can play incredibly well, or we can play not so well. But the girls just need to learn to have fun."
In the first match, Ingalls led 9-6 in the third set against Wheatland-Grinnell, but the Thunderhawks finished on a 19-3 run. Wheatland-Grinnell consistently delivered kills from the left side, as Ingalls had trouble shifting its block.
"We always said, 'They get one serve,'" Thunderhawk all-state senior setter Brooke Ostmeyer said. "We always try to sideout as soon as we can. If we mess up, we don't let it bother us."
Junior Tristan Rathgeber collected seven kills in the third set for the Thunderhawks.
"We didn't block her as well as we should have, and we weren't covering exactly where we should have either," Batman said.
Against B&B, Ingalls had what Batman called "some chemistry issues." Ingalls' three freshmen included one who hadn't seen much playing time.
"We had to work through those," Batman said. "End of the first set, there was a lot of friction on the team. Made a few changes and the girls really pulled together and they wanted to win, and represent our school very well, so we wanted to finish strong. We didn't want to end the year on a bad note."

Australian Reserve Bank leaves cash rate unchanged
Sydney: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Tuesday announced its decision to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.50 per cent after its July board meeting.
The decision to hold comes after the central bank cut the cash rate by 50 basis points in May and 25 basis points in June, reported Xinhua.
RBA Governor Glenn Stevens said Tuesday that the Australian economy grew faster than expected in first part of 2012, but there were signs of weakening in Europe and slower growth in China.
He said there had been no changes to the RBA’s outlook for inflation.
Stevens said financial markets had initially responded positively to signs of further progress towards longer-term sustainability in European financial affairs. However, he said Europe would still be a potential source of adverse shocks for a while.
“At today’s meeting, the board judged that, with inflation expected to be consistent with the target and growth close to trend, but with a more subdued international outlook than was the case a few months ago, the stance of monetary policy remained appropriate,” Stevens said in a statement accompanying the decision Tuesday.

Looking for an skilled and experienced programmer to develop a Joomla component/module which shows the Islamic prayer times for any country.
We will provide the method and logic required to calculate the prayer times, which will have to be based on the users IP and longitude/latitude lines as well as mathematical formulas.
Currently our site - - is running Joomla 1.5, so we are seeking development for this version, and one that will work in the upgraded versions (1.7 - 1.8) in the near future.
An example of the desired final solution should be similar to this - -
1. So when someone goes to our site's prayer section, it will automatically determine their location based on their IP (similar to this - ) but the desired CSS design and view should be similar to the mentioned site -.
So to reiterate, the desired final output should be a replica of this site - - and all its features and design.
Now to calculate the prayer time, this site - and - provide a step by step explanation on the mathematical and logic required to determine the prayer time for any area based on the users location and timezone.
Please base only calculation method as the Leva Research Institute, Qom, Iran.
Hope this is enough explanation of our desired goal and what we wish for it to achieve, but you may ask further questions if the need arises.
Thanks, happy bidding.

Tattooed Barbie: You're No Daughter Of Mine!
Mattel's new 'Totally Stylin' Barbie doll comes with a bunch of sticker tattoos you can apply all over her forehead and neck to make her look way more totally stylin'. Make her a little R2-D2 backpack and that is one fine piece of plastic ass (note to self: verify Barbie's age before using this). Plus, the doll comes with a fake tattoo gun and ink tattoos so your daughters (and sons) can apply tattoos to themselves! Shockingly, some parents aren't cool with the idea.
Barbie-maker Mattel has said the tattooed Barbie provides a way for kids to "be creative" with the doll. Some parents, naturally, see it differently, suggesting that a "Totally Pierced Barbie" or a "Divorce Barbie" could come next.
As for the tattooed Barbie, Mattel says it's selling better than expected and there are no plans to pull it from the product lineup.
Personally, I don't care, but that may just be because I don't have any daughters. No, I'm the proud father of three very handsome boys (woman always on top). Just kidding. But now that you know how they're made, ladies?

Use this device to store photos, videos and movies. Very easy for these to be set up. Only con so far is that fact that there is not a hdmi port on the device. that would be very easy to plug into the non-dlna smart tv. I am sure there is a usb-hdmi adapter just havent got that far yet. Very satisfied with the unit.
Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

ZyXel NSA325 is a very nice NAS box!
By Gilligan
from Overland Park, KS
Very nice NAS box with many cool features. Western Digital red 3tb drives work perfect, I have them in RAID 1. Manufacturer support seems good. There was a firmware update needed, super easy to install. No problems streaming large (.mkv) HD movies to TV or computer.CONS: Large file transfers max out the processor. Transfer speed is around 50 to 60mb/sec on a gigabit network. Wish that was higher. Overall I am very happy. It's fun to play with all it's features. It's well worth it's price!

Historical Newspaper Archives Search Tips
Newspaper Archives Last & First Name Search
-.
- However, if the person's name is popular, like Smith, try using some of the available search options such as location, date range, and keyword, in order to narrow your search to the specific Smith you are looking for (see below).
Using Advanced Search in the Newspaper Archive Database
- There are two keyword search boxes to narrow your search for newspaper articles: "Include keywords" box and "Exclude keywords" box (see below).
- Use the Date search box to enter a specific date or date range of the newspaper content you want to search online.
Using Keywords & Quotation Marks to Search Newspapers
- All the searches for historical newspaper articles are full-text keyword searches against OCR-generated ASCII text.
- By using the "Include keywords" box and/or "Exclude keywords" box, you can narrow or expand your online newspaper article search.
- Put phrases in quotes like "John Adams" in the "Include" keyword box to limit the newspaper article search to that exact name—versus using the last/first name search that brings back results matching John near2 Adams.
- If you find too many names in the newspaper archive search results, narrow your search even more by typing names or places you do NOT want in your search in the "Exclude" box.
Using Boolean Operators to Search Newspaper Archives
- Use AND, OR, ADJx (order specific), NEARx (order non-specific) and Wildcards, such as "?" and "*")
Broaden or narrow newspaper search queries
- by emptying filled-in fields to broaden your search, or filling in empty fields to narrow your search.
Display newspaper search results in different ways, such as:
- Best matches (this is the newspaper search default)
- Oldest items (based on newspaper publication dates)
- Newest items (based on newspaper publication dates)
- Once changed, the selection will remain the default until you change it again.
Search Newspapers by Date Range
- If you know the date of the newspaper content you are seeking, then use the "Date" search box.
- Enter a specific date or a date range—a variety of date formats are accepted.
- Examples: June 2, 1804, or 1804 - 1849, or June 1804 - August 1949.
Using Colonial English Variant Spellings to Search Old Newspapers
- Many of the newspapers in the historical newspaper archives are very old, and the searches must deal with Colonial English.
- The long "s" character was almost identical to the "f" in many texts.
- When searching old newspaper articles on words containing the letter "s," use the "?" wildcard in place of the "s."
- Note: this can occur whether it is the first letter, a letter within a word, or at the end of a word.
- The double "s" is in words like Massachusetts needs to be replaced with two wildcards in historical newspaper searches.
Examples of Searching for Old Newspaper Articles with Colonial English
- In addition, type was set by hand for early American newspapers and printers did not always have enough pieces of type to include all of the letters in a word. This resulted in letters being omitted, or sometimes letters that looked similar were used as substitutions.
- Much of this historic newspaper material did not use standard spellings.
- Examples of some conventions that were common in old newspapers:
- letter e to word endings
- Brown - Browne
- Chesapeake - Chefopeak or Chefopeake
- Clark - Clarke
- highways - highwayes
- Examples of interchanging use of the letters "i" and "y"
- adjoining - adjoyning
- Pennsylvania - Pensilvania or Penfilvania
- rails - rayls
Colonial Newspaper Search Notes
- If in doubt, use wildcards such as the question mark "?" or the asterisk "*" in your colonial newspaper search.
- A question mark is a single-character wildcard and an asterisk multi-character (allows for up to 5 characters) wildcard.

We had 11 members share - all the way from long-time members down to one of our newest members (who joined in October). There was a tremendous variety of remarks - from pure research experience to vacation summaries. Here are my summary of each person:
1) Bobbie (new member in 2006) - found immigration records for her German great-grandparents, and found much French-Canadian data while searching for, and finding, a Native American link.
2) Barbara - found data on her biological grandfather in World War I draft registrations and marriage certificate.
3) Martha - found probate records in South Carolina for her RevWar ancestor.
4) Kathy (new member in 2006) - connected with cousin through Internet with 11 generations of family
5) Shirley - found 1850 to 1880 census data for a previously elusive family with four different surname spellings - added a generation of ancestors.
6) John - found land record in PA for an ancestor, then googled the surname and found cousin with two published books, which extended his line 3 more generations.
7) Randy - started a genealogy blog, organized a successful workshop, found many probate records in MA and RI, got a lead on parents of an elusive ancestor, and visited New England to visit relatives, take pictures and drive through Maine, NH, VT and MA looking at the foliage.
8) Bill - received an email from somebody who found a letter with his surname in a purchased used book. He also vacationed in NC and found connections.
9) Helen - vacationed in Philadelphia and found lots of info on her ancestor, James Wilson, a Declaration signer and Supreme Court Justice.
10) Jan - visited the National Archives, DAR, and Colonial Dames libraries in Washington DC and found RevWar connections.
11) Penny (new member in 2006) - received a letter from a distant cousin (who did not respond to her 1993 letter earlier) who provided lots of data and introduced her to cousins in CA and WA.
Our members enjoy these sharing times because they reveal experiences and research tips, in addition to providing insight into their research problems. Several connections were made between members who had suggestions on further research.
Yours truly was elected President of CVGS for the next two years, and very capable people were elected for the officer positions. Our challenge will be to continue the excellent programs, to find ways to help our members in their research, and to not mess up a really good thing.

GEN News Highlights : Nov 18, 2010
OSEO, the French state innovation agency, has pledged €10.4 million (about $14.3 million) to fund a six-year collaborative program led by Pharnext, focused on developing an early-stage diagnostic for Alzheimer disease (AD) and a corresponding therapeutic Pleodrug™.
The funding will take the form of a €2.7 million grant and €7.7 million loan. The loan will only be repayable if the Dippal (diagnostic précoce et Pléothérapie de la maladie d’Alzheimer) project is successful. Collaborating with Pharnext will be biosystems international, the Bordeaux Center for Memory Resources and Research, the Unviersity Bordeaux Segalen, and Inserm’s epidemiology and biostatistics unit U897.
The Dippal project has three main goals: To develop and validate a prototype multiparameter blood test for the early diagnosis of AD; to discover and develop a Pleodrug™ for the treatment of AD through to the end of Phase II; and to develop a companion diagnostic for monitoring Pleodrug’s effectiveness and determining whether there are subpopulations of responder patients. The prototype diagnostic, theranostic, and Pleodrug will subsequently be licensed out to relevant industry partners for further development and commercialization.
Established in 2007, Pharnext is commercializing its pleotherapy platform, which is based on network pharmacology. The associated discovery engine is designed to identify rational drug combinations known as Pleodrugs, comprising cocktails of low-dose, off-patent drugs that have already been approved for other diseases. Pleodrugs are designed to target different mechanisms within the biological processes associated with a particular disease, Pharnext explains. A number of candidates are currently in development against a range of diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, Charcot disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and polycystic kidney disease.
In June Pharnext inked an exclusive research, development, and marketing agreement with Ipsen for its lead candidate against Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Under the terms of this agreement Pharnext will carry out development of the Pleodrug to the end of Phase II clinical trials. Ipsen will then take over to further the development and commercialization of the drug in Europe, the U.S., China, and certain other territories. Pharnext retains exclusive rights in other key markets.

March 24, 2013: Study finds molecular 'signature' for rapidly increasing form of esophageal cancer
From the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute:
During the past 30 years, the number of patients with cancers that originate near the junction of the esophagus and stomach has increased approximately 600 percent in the United States. The first extensive probe of the DNA of these esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) has revealed that many share a distinctive mix-up of letters of the genetic code, and found more than 20 mutated genes that had not previously been linked to the disease. The research, led by scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Broad Institute, and other research centers, may offer clues to why EAC rates have risen so sharply. The findings, which are being released as an advanced online publication by Nature Genetics, point to an array of abnormal genes and proteins that may be lynchpins of EAC cell growth and therefore serve as targets for new therapies, according to the study's authors. The work was supported in part by grants from the National Human Genome Research Institute.

Compression Genomics
A collaborative effort between researchers at MIT and Harvard University has produced a new, high-speed genome search algorithm described in the latest issue of Nature Biotechnology.
The new algorithm combines the power of data compression algorithms with genome alignment search tools.
Capitalizing on the fact that most currently sequenced genomes are very similar to previously collected ones, the team exploited this redundancy to allow for computation on compressed genome data. This approach shaves off time during the analysis of highly similar genomes to that of the time it takes to operate on one genome.
“You have all this data, and clearly, if you want to store it, what people would naturally do is compress it,” says Bonnie Berger, a professor.”
As described in their Nature Biotechnology paper, the researchers have implemented accelerated versions of both Blast and BLAT and underscore the importance of compression as a way to cope with ever-increasing amounts of genome data.
One obvious drawback of an approach like this is that, as more genomes are added to a database, the speed resulting from the analysis of compressed genomes decreases.

If you want to perform a networkless installation, you should read the Gentoo 2008.0 Handbooks which contain the
installation instructions for a networkless environment.
Also note that, if you plan on using GRP (the Gentoo Reference Platform, a
collection of prebuilt packages meant for immediate use after a Gentoo
installation), you must follow the instructions in the Gentoo 2008.0 Handbooks.
We also provide a Gentoo
Installation Tips & Tricks document that might be useful to read as
well. If you are an experienced Gentoo user and just need a brief installation
checklist, feel free to use our Quick Installation Guide available from our Documentation Resources if your architecture has
such a document available.
You also have several possibilities: you can compile your entire system from
scratch or use a prebuilt environment to have your Gentoo environment up and
running in no time. And of course you have intermediate solutions in which you
don't compile everything but start from a semi-ready system.
Troubles?
If you find a problem in the installation (or in the installation
documentation), please as our chat channel
covers the broad Gentoo spectrum :)
Speaking of which, if you have a question regarding Gentoo, check out our Frequently Asked Questions, available from the Gentoo Documentation. You can also view the FAQs on our

The photos featured on Getdecorating.com represent some of the leading interior designers and architects
in North America. With over 50,000 photos, Getdecorating has the largest collection of design
and decorating pictures on the web.
The number of photos posted next to the various subjects on the main screens is entirely
accurate and is in fact a computerized count of the pictures as we enter them in the database.
Please note that the screens indicate the number of photos in each category.
In addition to the Photo Gallery and all its categories, there are thousands of interesting photos and comments under the Networking tab. These represent every category of home design and products associated with home construction, furnishing and home accessories and are provided by businesses, professionals and home owner members and are easily accessible by browsing or key word searches.
Problems viewing the number of photos seem to occur for three main reasons:
1. Not clicking on pages. At the top of each category description i.e., Bathrooms/Powder/Master/Pool, the number of pages are shown followed by page number 1,2, 3, 4, 5, etc. It is necessary to click on these page numbers to go to the next screens. All screens contain nine "primary photos". (exception may be the last screen in the sequence).
The arrow at the end of the number sequence indicates there are more pages to follow, you must click on the last page number in the sequence and you will see a "double arrow." Click on this arrow to go to the next sequence of page numbers. Continue to follow this procedure until there is no "double arrow" showing.
2. Not scrolling down. In order to see all photos it is necessary to click on each "primary image" and SCROLL DOWN to see the "associated photos". The reason we have designed the pages this way is to try and depict the greatest amount of detail associated with any given "primary photo". For example, if we had a picture of a living room as the primary photo, we may show a detail of the window covering, crown molding, ceiling, furniture etc. all used in that particular room. In this way the user can see much more than the large scene of any given room or exterior. Often what appears to be the same photo will have subtle differences to show such things as, hidden pantries in kitchens, or screens on sliding doors, or hidden cabinets in bedrooms, usually designed to accommodate television sets. The number of "associated photos" varies, with some pictures not having any and others as many as 25.
All photos in the Photo Gallery are generally available in three sizes. The best detail can be seen using the largest photos. Using the thumbnails or the next smaller photo size, will allow you to browse more photos faster, rather than having to look at each one in the largest size.
3. Not deleting your Temporary Internet files. Your browser could contain a memory of the last photo pages you have been viewing and as a result your cache memory (Temporary Internet files) could be full. You can clear its memory by clearing the cache. In order to speed up web browsing, web browsers are designed to download web pages store them locally on your machine in an area called "cache". When you visit the same page for a second time or click the "back" button, the browser speeds up display time by loading the page locally from cache instead of downloading everything again, this sometimes results in less than current versions of web pages being displayed. If you believe that you have a less than current version of a page or unable to open more pages or see only the preview images, please use the following steps to clear the cache in your browser. You should clear cache at least once a week. Note: directions vary depending on whether you use the AOL, Internet Explorer or Netscape browser. However, for Internet Explorer and most browsers, go to the top of the browser, click on "tool" button and then click on "Internet options." A screen will open on the "General Tab" and show three headings. Go to "Temporary Internet files" and click on "Delete Cookies" and "Delete Files." This will clear your cache memory and overcome any problem viewing images.
Please remember to click on Logout when finished browsing images, not the X on your browser. If you have not clicked on Logout you may have to re-type our URL into the address line of your browser and not use "favorites" until you have re-typed the URL. Once you have done this, then add to favorites again. You may also have a security issue, such as a firewall/spam blocker/anti-virus program that is not allowing our HTML pages through or your security settings are not allowing cookies to be enabled.

We’re chuffed to say that our revamped customers area is now live – and just in time for Christmas!
This update includes a ton of improvements and we’ve also added a bunch of completely new features – including the ability to merge customers.
The full list of changes include:
Massive shout-out to our own Willy B. who has been labouring over this project for the last few weeks.
Awesome work guys! Looks great.
Just a friendly point-out that the ‘Import Customers’ tab now opens underneath the main Customer section.
Keep up the good work, and Merry Christmas
Thanks Andy – good spotting. We’ll get that fixed up. Merry Christmas to you and the team too!
Pingback: Timely adds Facebook Appointments, Smarter SMS Messaging – BoxFreeIT : BoxFreeIT
The MERGE feature is BRILLIANT ! ! ! You have saved me a lot of time on a weekly basis. I have been going in, working my way through the lists and manually merging customers for the past few months. Sometimes when customers book their own appointments online they mis-spell their name or a new customer file is created for them so I have had to change their appointments individually to the correct customer file etc. So YAY! Thanks for that!
Great to hear! Warm fuzzies for us

There is nothing wrong with getting a tattoo. There is nothing wrong with asking a tattoo artist what would look good. A quality tattoo artist even if they'd never played the game or understand the reference can tell you whether the tattoo will turn out well long-term in terms of how it'll age. It's actually probably smarter to go this route because they won't be biased toward or against a character or quote. They are simply there to help you design a quality tattoo. You should come up with a short list of three or so games and look try to come up with three rough ideas per game. Take these to two or more tattoo shops and let them give you their inputs and appraisals. If that sounds like a lot of work, remember that this is your body and it's worth it.
That being said, the Tatau from Far Cry 3 is a great tattoo, and furthermore, a great video game tattoo. Two birds. One Tatau.

$299.00
PLEASE CHOOSE A REGISTRY LIST TO ADD YOUR GIFTS TO:
Perfect for daily use, this powerful electric double pump is a favorite of moms everywhere! It simulates natural nursing patterns to help provide maximum milk flow, and comes in a stylish tote that lets you take it anywhere.
Why it's a giggle pick This fully-loaded breast pump is the top-of-the-line model7.27 lbs.
- AgeNewborn - 12 Months
Rated 4.8 out of 5 by 26 reviewers.
Rated 4 out of 5 Great, but handsfree is better You have to buy a handsfree bra in order to use this, which is ~$40, so I recommend, just buy the handsfree pump for the beginning. Being handsfree while pumping is absolutely necessary! December 12, 2012
Rated 4 out of 5 by pizzalover A must have for a working nursing mom! I used my Medela Pump in Style with both of my kids with great success. I was able to breast feed excessively through their first birthday while working full time, which was my goal. I will say that with my second child it seemed like toward the end the pump wasn't as strong. Maybe it was wearing out after being used multiple times a day through two kids? Not sure. Maybe it was just me too. But overall, it was easy to use, needed replacement parts were easy to get, and it worked well! December 11, 2012
Rated 5 out of 5 by RyansMom8 Must Have for Working Moms While it is not always ideal to have to be nursing and back at work, this pump makes the process so much easier. The cooler located in the bag is perfect, and the tote's bigger size allows you to stuff in extra parts. Three recommendations...if you need the battery pack, keep lots of extras on hand. It requires 8 but I found it drains them pretty quickly. I would also recommend buying extra Medela bottles to pump into. Even though I was using the Playtex system, I found it easier at work to use the bottles and then dump them into my own freezer system when I got home. The Medela wipes were also a must for me...as it made it easier not to run back and forth to the sink with all the parts (for work) while the steam bags were great for home. Highly recommend March 26, 2012
Rated 5 out of 5 by CoolMom A must! This pump will be your best friend. This is the pump to get. Don't question it. Just get it. Don't think about the price. Just do it. You will need this powerhorse! March 26, 2012
Rated 5 out of 5 by Chellins Great for the working mom This is great and made it possible to breast feed past the one year mark. Excellent pump, I will be using it again when my next baby arrives in a couple months. March 21, 2012
Rated 5 out of 5 by Rehanna My Medela saved me ! Out of everything we bought for the birth of our little baby I consider the breast pump the best thing we ever purchased. My baby had a very hard time latching on (in fact she never latched on!) that our lactation consultant suggested this breast pump and OMG it was such a life saver! I pumped at least 3~5 times a day for 3 months and my baby got her breast milk! I HIGHLY recommend this pump for new mother. Please it will save your life ! March 21, 2012
Rated 5 out of 5 by moonrose2715 Love this pump Although I have the backpack version (not the tote version) I love this pump. It was relatively quiet and super easy to use. I definitely recommend getting a hands-free bra to use with it, since I typically needed to do a little massage to get my best production, or needed to entertain my baby. I had severe supply issues and ended up pumping a great deal more than planned or expected. I also had a hospital grade pump for a couple of months. I found that the Pump-In-Style worked just as well as the hospital grade pump did. Also, it is very easy to take on the go. I could easily load up everything I needed in my bag, including pesonal items, and carry it as my "purse". It is worth every penny to invest in a good pump. March 20, 2012
Rated 5 out of 5 by Artmom Working Mom Must Have I am gone from the house 12 hours a day. This pump has allowed me to continue breast feeding for my son. I am so greateful for it's easy use. Gentle suction that works and it's so portable and easy to pack up. Great product March 19, 2012

Battery life
Q:I noticed that the Medela Pump in Style requires 8 AA batteries. Generally, how long can you pump for before needing to replace them?

Answers
A:Medela's Pump in Style Advanced On-the-Go pump may be operated with a battery pack that uses 8 AA alkaline batteries, or, for more consistent pump performance, use rechargeable batteries. Each set of batteries will provide approximately 2 hours of pumping time. It is recommended that batteries be replaced or recharged between the 10th and 12th pumping session.

Original Penguin
The amusing story behind Original Penguin begins in 1955 with Munsingwear salesman Abbot Pederson, who, during a sales trip to New York City, bought a stuffed penguin from a Manhattan taxidermist and sat with the specimen on his flight home to Minneapolis. During the trip, the penguin ended up wearing Pederson’s tie — prompting a flight attendant to remark that such a fancy penguin deserved to be embroidered on a shirt. Pederson shared the idea with his colleagues, and soon thereafter Munsingwear debuted the Original Penguin golf shirt — creating an icon of suburban leisure and a favorite among athletes. Half a century later, young urbanites began trolling thrift stores for clothing marked with Pete the Penguin. In response, Chris Kolbe relaunched the brand, now under the Perry Ellis umbrella, in 2003. Today the brand's comprehensive menu includes its signature piped placket shirt as well as swimwear, footwear, watches, hats, shoes, eyewear, and ties.

So you’re mashing potatoes and have a mound of skins. And maybe T.G.I. Franchise has made you think that those skins are only for being covered in 2500 calories-worth of neon cheese. But—surprise!—potato peels are nutritious, tasty and useful even without bacon bits. Turn them into crusts for savory pies, crunchy snacks, and even use them in place of breadcrumbs; their sturdy, earthy flavor and ability to crisp are so intriguing when they’re unexpected.
But first, we’re talking uncooked peels that look good enough to eat, so skip peels from potatoes that are shriveled, green from sunburn, or tentacled with sprouts. The best peel comes from large, starchy potatoes with thick skins, like russets, although really huge baking potatoes can be too leathery. Small, waxy, so-called new potatoes yield only flimsy tatters that cling to your fingers like damp tissue, so skip them. (Just leave their skins on whenever you’re cooking them for extra flavor and fiber.)
Potato peel should taste earthy, not earthen, so start with well-scrubbed potatoes. A sharp Y-shaped peeler removes wide, even strips of peel that are easy to handle. To store the peels for up to three days, submerge them in cool water, cover, and refrigerate. A pound of potatoes yields about 1¼ cups of packed peels, and here are four commendable ways to make the most of the lowliest part of a potato.
Crumbs: Bits of peel can replace the fresh bread crumbs used to bind meatballs, meatloaf, or croquettes. Chop or pulse the peels in a food processor, into pieces just small enough to look like rolled oats (excess processing will spin them into a gluey mess) and substitute them one-to-one.
Crackers: Remove the peel in pieces as long and wide as possible. If they curl, snip the edges to help them lie flat on the baking sheet. Brush with oil and sprinkle with one or more of the following: coarse salt, ground pepper, finely grated Parmesan or other hard cheese, a pinch of dried herbs, and/or garlic or onion powder. Bake at 450°F until crisp and lightly puffed, about 6 minutes. Serve hot or let cool, uncovered. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days.
Crisps: Remove the peel in long, wide strips and pat them very dry. Leave the strips whole or thinly slice them to make frizzled straws. Fill a deep, heavy skillet or pot to a depth of 1 inch with oil and heat it to 350°F. (If you don’t have a deep-fat thermometer, test the temperature by sprinkling a pinch of flour into the oil; it should immediately sizzle and begin to brown without hissing or spitting.) Adding no more pieces than can float freely, fry them until they are lightly blistered and the flesh sides are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain well and season while hot with salt, Old Bay, BBQ rub, or anything else you like.
Crusts: Potato peel crust is softer and darker than pastry crust, but it delivers the hearty, satisfying flavor that one expects from well-seasoned potatoes. This versatile mixture can be formed into a pie shell or baked flat for a kind of flatbread. (When cool, it even folds like a slice of pizza.) Chop 2 cups of firmly packed peel (from about 1½ pounds of potatoes) until the pieces resemble coarse sawdust. Toss with 1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt and drain in a sieve for 15 minutes. Squeeze out every drop of moisture. Transfer to a bowl and stir in ¾ cup very finely chopped onion, 2 large beaten eggs, and ¼ cup all-purpose flour (or rice flour for a gluten-free version). If you like, add up to 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, sage, oregano, or parsley. Press the mixture into one of the baking pans described below. Bake at 425°F until set, about 15 minutes. Brush lightly with olive oil and continue baking until the crust is very firm and lightly crisped along the edge, 6 to 8 minutes more. If the crust still isn’t as crisp as you like, stick it under a preheated broiler, but watch it carefully.
- For a pie shell, press the mixture into a greased 9-inch pie tin. For mini shells, press the mixture into 12 standard or 6 jumbo muffin cups (but the baking time will be shorter). This crust is great with savory egg custard fillings, such as quiche.
- For “pizza” crust, press the mixture onto an oiled 12-inch pizza pan.
- For flatbread, press the mixture to a ¼-inch thickness on an oiled baking sheet. While warm, cut it into serving pieces and serve warm or at room temperature, either unadorned or topped. When cool, the pieces can be filled and then rolled or folded, like soft lavash or a tortilla.

I am really nervous about going to school next fall. I mean, I went to a community college its not like I havent been in a college atmosphere, but this is a HUGE university! I know people who are going there but I dont know a single person who is in my area of intrest or in any classes with me. My best friend who is going there is no longer my friend so that kind of rules out having a good friend there. I dont know where my classes are, and I am worried that I will have one class on the west bank and 15 minutes later have another one over on the east bank or something!!! And I am worried about my classes what if they are too hard?? I am just freaking out here...
What I always did was as soon as I had my schedule, I walked around and found where all my classes were located. If there are back to back classes on opposite sides of campus, you might want to switch to a different section (class time/location). If it's a big univesity, then there should be several sections of the same class to choose from.
As far as not knowing anyone, the first university that I went to was 8 hours from where I grew up and I knew no one going there. I ended up making friends with my roommate and a couple of people from my classes. Study groups are also a good way to meet people.
Good luck!
Lisa
don't freak out. go to campus a day or two early and look around and find your buildings. it makes life easier. i can help you if you want. you'll be fine!
Erika, if you have the time that would be awesome! I was thinking of going a few days before school starts and finding all my classes... it would be cool if you want to come with me.
i know that your school is a hundred time bigger than ours... erika can atest to my awe when i saw it... but really it was nt that huge of a transition for me going from communtiy college to university.
i knew no one when i started, and it has gotten btter.. especially my second semester i started recognizing people that were in my same field and i had taken classes with.
i always have nightmares that my classes with be soooo far apart.
let erika help you, she is a pro at that campus!!
and congrats, and good luck!!!
also the student parent help center is a HUGE resource!!
where is that?
in johnson hall, basement i think. its got a lot of community resources. runs a parenting group. lots of neat mamas. good staff. scholarships for childcare. toys. coloring books.
cool! i think i know where that is... its the place where they have the advisors and stuff right? i will have to check that out, thanks
It's in Appleby Hall, actually.
And Skylar, you should give me a call and we can find your classes. I have free time on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays right now.

Prior to beginning a Gold Award project, a girl must earn four Interest Project Patches, the Leadership Award, the Career Award and the Four B’s Challenge: Become, Belong, Believe and Build. These four requirements enable girls to develop skills, practice leadership, explore career possibilities, and discover their self-potential.

eriously?! You do not mix football and poetry. Fine I wrote this for extra credit and got 20 points...
Lost at War
I walk on these barren lands
Watch the blood flow from my hands.
The gut-retching terror in my soul
I feel like I’m spiraling out of control.
I watched the people I trusted die
Barely having time to say good-bye.
I feel the mental and physical pain
This whole idea is purely insane.
The bloodshed, the hatred, the ultimate fear
Watching all life suddenly disappear.
Why do these warriors slowly fall?
Why do they take the risk of losing it all?
And as I watch the horrors come to an end
I realize that they may be trying to defend
A country, full of lives and full of choice.
A country of freedom and of every voice.
Do I fight with the blood and the terror?
For the country with hope that is even rarer?
For the unnamed lives that will be lost
I thank you, and will help you, at any cost.

I try to write poems but they aren't that good. I mostly start writing stories for school and if I think they're good I'll write more. Right now I'm writing a story about assassins. 32 (roughly) people have died already!

@izzyrose
This can be very hard! But you gotta hang in there. I'm sure that everyone has told you "When one door closes, another one opens!" But it can be hard to find that door. Take a look at your new class. Be extra vigilant. Did you find someone that looks like potential friend? The shy girl in the corner? Well, don't keep quiet. Find your new acquaintance! Start out small. Offer her a piece of your dessert. Then the next day, do the same. Until you feel your strong enough, ask her if you can sit with her at lunch. She should say yes. Build on your relationship from there! hope this helps!
(And if it doesn't, don't sweat! Try finding clubs or activities outside of school you'll like. You'll most likely find a friend with the same interest!)

Okay so ive moved to a new school this yr and I feel like nobody want me there. Ill have to stay at this school for the rest of my elementary hood so that makes it even worse. Im depressed sometimes and sometimes cry because of it and I dont like it at home either. I feel like I belong at my other school because of like a million things. What should I do?

I am kind of going through the same thing when I think about it, except to not that extreme where I have no real friends and don't talk at all. But I'm trying to get over it, too
by marshmelo on 11/8/2011 6:12:17 PM
I think it's so amazing that you sort of healed yourself. I know that some people can't do that and I think it shows just how strong you are as a person to be able to do that. I'm so so sorry that you had to go through that though. Now that you know how it feels, help other people too! Good job getting the word out! You're very inspirational to me

Former Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has backed FC Copenhagen's Andreas Cornelius to earn a move to Old Trafford.
The 19-year-old was promoted to the Copenhagen first-team squad in May and has enjoyed quite a rise since being given his senior chance, scoring ten goals in his first 11 appearances.
Cornelius has already been awarded a first cap for Denmark, while he scored in first goal in European competition last week against Solskjaer's Norwegian champions Molde.
Solskjaer, who scored for Manchester United in their dramatic 1999 Champions League final win, now believes the young forward can continue his rapid rise and believes his is good enough to play under Sir Alex Ferguson.
“Yes, he’s definitely an option [for United],” Solskjaer said, according to Sport360. “He has the qualities to play at the top level if he continues his development.
“He has speed, he has art. And I think he is very good in the air. He can go as far as he possibly wants.”
Ferguson has been active in the recruitment of young strikers in recent seasons, with the acquisition of Javier Hernandez followed by the signing of Angelo Henriquez during the summer, and Cornelius could be next.

Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse is a reported target for Liverpool and Tottenham with suggestions the Senegal international is becoming frustrated with life at St James' Park.
The pursuit of goalscoring reinforcements would appear to be a January transfer window priority for Liverpool, while Spurs are also light up front, and Cisse is reported to be considering his future with Newcastle.
According to The Mirror, Liverpool and Spurs are both monitoring Cisse with the Newcastle star struggling to replicate his stunning form from last season.
Cisse scored 13 goals in 14 games after joining Newcastle from Freiburg in January, with the 27-year-old netting the goal of the season against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in May.
He has, however, scored only just once for Newcastle in the Premier League this season and his current predicament has seemingly caught the attention of both Liverpool and Spurs.
Luis Suarez is the only senior striker available to Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and bringing at least one more forward to Anfield in January is surely a must for the Reds.
Tottenham, meanwhile, are slightly better stocked up front with Jermain Defoe and Emmanuel Adebayor among their number, but Andre Villas-Boas is likely to further bolster his forward department, should the opportunity arise.

Glasslamʼs first new silicone spacer module arrives
April 6, 2011
COMMERCIAL, RETAIL, FABRICATION
Glasslam has its first fully inline silicone spacer module at its Pompano Beach, Fla., headquarters, according to an April 5 release. “We're very excited to show off this new manufacturing system to any company interested in making their own silicone spacer at a fraction of their current costs," said Steve Howes, CEO, in the release. "The payback is unbelievably quick, and the system is a game-changer in warm edge spacer.” Feedback has been amazing from many of the largest users of flexible spacer in the world, he said.
Matt Hale, Air-Tight products sales manager for Glasslam, compares the impact of the new system to that of the regionalization of custom tempering over the last 20 years. “There was a time when large regional glass tempering companies shipped their products hundreds and thousands of miles," he said in the release. "Now there are state-of-the-art tempering facilities in most every metropolitan area. That's what this Glasslam invention means for the warm edge spacer business.”
The new system will operate using less than 10 percent of the energy costs of current flexible spacer manufacturing processes, making it the most environmentally friendly and technologically advanced way to make warm edge spacer products, Howes said in the release.

Holmegaard glassworks declared bankrupt
(1/3) > >>
a40ty:
On Friday Holmegaard glassworks was declared bankrupt; 150 employees have lost their jobs and 60 have been suspended. It seems that the glassworks and the activity centre have been kept separate and that the latter will continue.
Pinkspoons:
It's a shame, but not exactly a surprise. They've been in financial difficulty on and off since the 1970s, and haven't released any interesting new designs for about 15 years.
I daresay, though, that someone will buy up the brandname and continue the outsourced production in Poland that Holmegaard have been running since the '70s.
R.I.P. real Holmegaard.
Pinkspoons:
I think the problem with a lot of these glassworks (and most businesses in general) is that as soon as they hit trouble they streamline their output to just the very safe and very neutral designs - as well as the very cheap designs - then try to trade solely on their brandname and charge something not dissimilar to studio glass prices for bland and tired mass-production items.
a40ty:
Hear hear! The innovative designers have already got the boot and have left for pastures new.
Pinkspoons:
Just flicking through the pages of Holmegaard's 1999 catalogue and nearly all of it is identical to their current one. Very few changes indeed.

25 Years of Global Exchange
In 1988, four friends co-founded Global Exchange to fight a worldview based on greed, domination, and unvarnished worship of power. Global Exchange was founded to change the hearts and minds of those lured to believe that corporate profit would trickle down to create wealth for all. We aimed to speak truth to power. We sought to create awareness of what was being called, “global warming.” We chose to stand in solidarity with South Africans seeking democracy and with peasant farmers seeking a fair economy.

In addition to compensation to customers, banks are incurring big administration charges. RBS said this accounted for 325 million pounds of its provisions. Following are details of provisions by major banks (in millions of pounds, except HSBC in millions of dollars): PPI === BANK PROVISION PAID OUT PERCENT OF PROVISION PAID Lloyds 5,300 3,700 70 Barclays 2,600 1,600 61 RBS 2,200 1,300 700 c.5,000 600 HSBC $240 c.5,000 customers c.200 Santander -- fewer than 500 ($1 = 0.6608 British pounds) (Compiled by Steve Slater and Matt Scuffham; Editing by Jane Merriman)

The US Anti-Doping Agency has brought formal charges against Lance Armstrong, which may cause the former cyclist to lose his seven Tour de France victories, the Washington Post reported.
Armstrong, who began competing in triathlons after his retirement from cycling, has been banned from the sport because of the charges. His former teammates, Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton cooperated with federal agents and accused Armstrong of doping.
According to USA Today, Armstrong has strongly denied doping accusations throughout his career. He has never tested positive, Sports Illustrated reported.
"I have never doped, and, unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one," Amstrong said in a statement he released via Twitter.
He further elaborated on his website, according to the BBC: ."
More on GlobalPost: LA Kings, Dustin Brown score with video hat trick (VIDEO)
Earlier this year the US Attorney's office ended their investigation in Armstrong, after a two year probe into doping allegations.
Armstrong said in his statement of the latest charges: "These are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the Justice Department chose not to pursue after a two-year investigation."
USADA is the quasi-government agency that oversees anti-doping in Olympic sports in the United States. It does not have authority to bring criminal charges.
The USADA said, "USADA only initiates matters supported by the evidence. We do not choose whether or not we do our job based on outside pressures, intimidation or for any reason other than the evidence," according to the BBC.

Scientists at Argonne National Laboratory have discovered a possible mechanism to control chirality in biological molecules. Chirality, or 'handedness,' is a trait existing in the basic molecules of all living things, and controlling it has long been a goal of researchers. By changing the magnetization direction of some chiral molecules in relation to a high-intensity X-ray beam, an excess of one form of chirality was created over another. Understanding such basic occurrences in the building blocks of matter could be an important step to understanding the origin of life....")

Researchers are looking to put micro-robots to work as internal surgeons. The hope is that some of these tablet-shaped robots could perform certain gastrointestinal operations without injuring the patient's body. The process would begin with the swallowing of individual parts of the robot, which would then self-assemble into a more powerful system to perform the task. The feasibility of such an operation is currently being tested in artificial stomachs.
The design of surgical implants will soon be undergoing a revolutionary change. So says a team of researchers at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and their supportive peers. The team has succeeded in coating surgical implants with "intelligent" fibers that will facilitate bonding action to the living bone. This bonding technique, said to be the first of its kind, will last throughout the patient's lifetime, and will improve the reliability and durability of the implant.
Perpetually powered data acquisition? You heard right. GE Energy has recently developed wireless sensors with an endless power supply. The sensors harvest and use vibration energy from the very machines they monitor. How? The system uses a micro-generator to transform vibrational energy into serviceable electrical energy. It also stores that energy in a super-capacitor; during peak operational phases, there will still be enough power for data measurement and transfer.
How does one acquire data in temperatures that sometimes drop to -80° C? Embedded technologies are the answer, allowing researchers to gather data in extreme situations such as at the South Pole. Find out how an IceCube experiment is being developed to detect neutrinos by recording flashes of light through a telescope, or by measuring the acoustics involved in a neutrino collision. These data acquisition systems have all been designed to be rugged, stable, and cold-rated.

Measuring the presence of dark matter is a task that's, well, out of this world. A newly developed detector out of MIT can help aid in this pursuit. Existing detectors are flawed in that they continue to pick up the presence of ordinary matter. However, these detectors, when run simultaneously with the new device, can identify the presence of all ordinary neutrons, leaving the dark matter detector to locate any other signals as a strong candidate for identification as dark matter
Respiratory measurement technology is being fine-tuned at a new research facility, and the hope is that researchers can use their discoveries for several applications. One such example is in the realm of breath monitoring. Breath monitoring can be a crucial tool in the diagnosis of respiratory conditions. One problem that researchers have overcome is how to collect data from a normal breath, as opposed to making the patient exhale forcefully — a task that can be impossible for seriously ill patients.

The current state of nanotechnology safety in the U.S. is woefully inadequate says a new report. The main issue appears to be a lack of research to provide the public with information that can improve acceptance and understanding of the benefits of nanotechnology. The report also calls on the Obama administration to consider a new strategy for identifying and managing potential risks.
Latest word out of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is that nanotechnology could play a big role in food safety. Specifically, ARS has developed a microscopic biological sensor that can detect the presence of salmonella bacteria. Researchers used nanotechnology principles to help develop the sensor, and include fluorescent organic dye particles that attach to the bacteria, making it easier to spot.

Residential customers in Singapore connected by the country’s carrier-neutral FTTH operator, Nucleus Connect, will soon be able to pick and choose between different telecoms operators David Storrie: multi-tiered approach has challenges. If you’re vertically integrated, everything is under your own control The Singapore telecoms regulator is commissioning the development of a set-top box that will allow customers to take services from different telecoms operators at the same time via the country’s next-generation national broadband network. The box — which will bring the market in telecoms right to consumers’ homes — will be connected to the national carrier-neutral fibre-to-the-home network, which is operated by a local company, Nucleus Connect.
“The project is being managed by the government and the plan is to have the specification by the end of this year,” says Nucleus Connect’s CEO, David Storrie. Following that, the box.

About this entry:
At the end of the second millennium of the Third Age, the realm of Gondor came close to its destruction..
Unknown to the victorious Wainriders, their allies in the south had met with much less success. Beyond hope, the Gondorian Captain Eärnil had led Gondor's Southern Army to victory over the Haradrim, destroying their army in South Ithilien, to the north of the Poros. Then challenged her again, and the battle where Eärnil won his success was named after the Wainrider camp where it had taken place: the Battle of the Camp.

About this entry:
The third of the great battles of the Wars of Beleriand, and the most decisive victory for the Elves. Some sixty years after the Return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, Morgoth sent out armies of Orcs to test the northern defences of Beleriand. The Orcs attacked in the west through the Pass of Sirion, and in the east through Maglor's Gap. Both of these assaults were repulsed by the Noldor, and the armies of Morgoth were destroyed completely: it was said that not a single one of the thousands of Orcs ever returned to Angband.
To commemorate this great victory, the Elves gave it the name Dagor Aglareb, which translates as the 'Glorious Battle'. With the Orcs defeated, the Noldor set a siege around the Dark Lord's domain - the Siege of Angband - that kept Beleriand safe from any similar invasion for nearly four hundred years.

FIFA President Sepp Blatter 'Deeply Moved' After Togo Attacks
FIFA concerned by shocking events...
FIFA has expressed concerns after the Togo national team bus was attacked by rebels in Cabinda en-route to the Africa Cup of Nations on Friday.
Emmanuel Adebayor, the team captain, revealed that the Togo players will meet on Saturday to decide if they will still take part in the tournament after a machine gun attack on their bus - lasting 30 minutes - killed their driver and left six others injured.
FIFA spokesman Nicolas Maingot told Goal.com UK: ''FIFA and its president, Joseph S. Blatter, are deeply moved by today's incidents which affected Togo's national team, to whom they express their utmost sympathy.
"FIFA is in touch with the African confederation and its president, Issa Hayatou, from which it expects a full report on the situation.''

Jason O. Watson-US PRESSWIRE, US PRESSWIRE
Being an avid New York Mets fan (yes, it is as painful as it sounds and some), I've run across many an interesting post from Mets beat writers, bloggers (including the guys over at Amazin' Avenue, which by the way, if you're not familiar with, is one of THE VERY BEST blogs out there in the SB Nation network, and if you're a baseball fan of any team I'd recommend it) and fans. But one of the most captivating ideas I've seen in any setting is the yearly "Take 'Em Or Trash 'Em" segment done by Adam Rubin, who covers the Mets for ESPN.com. In what has become a yearly exercise, Rubin will ask fans to vote on members of the Mets roster, giving them option of either taking them (or keeping) or trashing them (basically what it sounds like). And while he has included Manager Terry Collins, General Manager Sandy Alderson and the Wilpon Family (Majority Owners of the Mets) this year (couldn't tell/remember if he did a year ago, as the posts glitched and somehow merged), he didn't offer his opinion like he did for the players. So as this is a site for all things Virginia Tech, and colleges can't really trash players (well actually they can, and when they do it's even more disgusting, but let's just say it happens less often at Tech) and they don't actually tender the players contracts and pay them to play (yet), I thought it would be fun to do a Keep 'Em or Trash 'Em (I changed Take to Keep because I think it just makes more sense) for the entire Virginia Tech football coaching staff and similarly, let the fans decide the fate of the Hokies' coaches (well...at least on here). But before you fire from the hip and cast your vote, make sure you read the pros and cons below to see if there's anything that would change your mind or alter your opinion. If not, happy voting and have fun.
So after reading the title for this article, you might be thinking, "If you're going to do a series of posts on which Virginia Tech coaches should be fired and which should keep their jobs, why in the world are you starting with Shane Beamer?" To which I would answer, I understand what a peculiar choice it seems like, but I will be doing these posts chronologically relative to when the coaches were hired. So, by virtue of being the newest hire on the staff (two days senior of Cornell Brown), Shane is up first. So let's dive right in.
Reasons For Keeping Him
I think this is going to be one of the quickest posts in this series, if not THE quickest. Let's start with his best asset. The younger Beamer is somewhat of a master recruiter, having made a name for himself on the recruiting trail both at Virginia Tech and his previous stops. According to Rivals.com, since 2009, (only the second year he was given a full recruiting load), Beamer has individually landed an astounding EIGHT four-star recruits, including guys like Alshon Jeffery, Connor Shaw, and for the Hokies, Joel Caleb, Holland Fisher, Drew Harris and Deon Clarke. He was also assigned as the personal recruiter for names like A.J. Green, Robert Quinn, and Trent Richardson at South Carolina, so it shows the kind of faith Steve Spurrier and his staff put in Beamer.
For the Hokies, he has also been assigned as the personal recruiter for guys like Derrick Green (the nation's top running back prospect), Jarron Jones (a huge Notre Dame commit from a year ago), Tim Harris (now a UVA decommit) and Dorian Johnson (a Pitt commitment that the Hokies desperately wanted), all of whom were ranked four stars or higher by Rivals and two of whom may not have even considered Tech without Shane Beamer being their personal recruiter. It is also worth noting that for whatever reason, Rivals shows that Beamer did not have a full load in 2011 as well, so if you were to take an average of how many four star recruits Beamer raked in between the recruiting classes of 2009-13 (seasons in which he had a full recruiting load), you would come up with two per year. That's pretty terrific for an individual recruiter.
Over that time period, the coach who was previously considered as Virginia Tech's best recruiter, Bryan Stinespring, has nabbed exactly five four-stars. In fact, going back all the way to 2006 to include Virginia Tech coaches' recruiting efforts (the first year Rivals began tracking recruits landed by an individual recruiter), no Hokie coach landed as many four-star or higher recruits individually in those eight classes as Beamer did in the five classes since 2009. Just in case you were interested, Coach Cavanaugh pulled in six and a half, Gray and Stinespring landed six apiece and Newsome added five and a half (the halves represent a player in which the two coaches shared the lead as a primary recruiter for Tyrod Taylor). So it's fair to say that Shane has galvanized the recruiting efforts, as in his two years at Tech, the football program has seen probably its best two recruiting years in school history (as long as the 2013 class remains intact).
To that end, he is personable, relatable, charismatic, courteous and young, character traits that players and their families take note of. That's why Virginia Tech players (particularly running backs like David Wilson) have oozed about how much they've enjoyed playing for him and how much he fires them up. It's always great to have guys like that on the sideline (ahem, Stinespring, you too buddy) as a lot of the Virginia Tech coaches seem fairly vanilla in their interactions with players on the sideline.
Reasons For Trashing Him
So here are the knocks on Shane Beamer. He is a positional coach who has coached at least three different positions in his assistant coaching stints. There is nothing wrong with being a positional coach, but often it's hard to judge a positional coach because you don't get to see the X's and O's, and unless you know what you're looking for or the commentators point it out, a lot of what a positional coach teaches is technique. And let's be honest, if you're watching a game and the running back goes 80 yards, are you paying attention to his technique, or are you saying "Holy hell look how fast that kid is," or "Man what a great call that was" (I am aware you're not saying that for Hokie games, just giving a hypothetical). In fact, David Wilson fits the first part of that scenario to a T, and given that Beamer inherited that supernatural freak athlete at his position, coupled with the struggles of the group this year (even thought the offensive line often played horribly), it is fair to ask how much of the success Tech has had with their running backs in the last two years was David Wilson/J.C. Coleman, and how much of it was Beamer? TBD.
The point is, while positional coaches are rarely the goat, you often don't know what you have in them until they take a position as a coordinator or a head coach, something Shane might be poised to do in the near future. Speaking of which, Shane's name came up as a a person of interest several times during coaching searches after the season, including reported interest by Georgia State, who ended up replacing the retiring Bill Curry with Trent Miles. To several people I have spoken with, taking a job as the head coach of another team for a few years to develop some head coaching experience wouldn't be a bad thing. I understand that logic, but what I don't understand is why he would leave a job working for his father in which he is essentially being groomed as the coach-in-waiting. As far as head coaching experience goes, I think having been around the elder Beamer in his coaching career can only help to prepare him. I know that Shane taking another job isn't necessarily trashing him, but the end result would essentially be the samd: Shane would not be at Virginia Tech under either scenario.
The very last thing I think you could fault Beamer for is the sporadic and often questionable running back rotations used this season. I don't know if Shane really has full control over personnel decisions, but at any rate, some of the substitutions for certain plays/packages were so boneheaded (for instance using J.C. Coleman as a lead blocker and Martin Scales on outside runs) that even being a part of the decision-making and not objecting signals a pretty significant problem. Also, contrary to what the staff said about the running back-by-committee in the off-season, they often went away from the hot hand instead of sticking with it. So the rotations and substitutions based on play-calling/packages has to get better, no matter who's responsible for it.
Final Argument
Again, as I said in the beginning, this one is pretty easy. I don't see any reason to want to fire the team's youngest coach, most successful recruiter and potential head coach-in-waiting. Shane has a promising future (most likely at Virginia Tech), and despite some unknowns to this point, he has brought a lot to the program with his influence both in recruiting and on the sideline. I think he is and will continue to be a stabilizing force on the staff for years to come.
Verdict: Keep 'Em
Poll
So what should be Shane Beamer's fate?

RADFORD, Va. - The Coastal Carolina University volleyball team took home two of the top awards and had four players earn Big South Conference honors for their play in the regular season, announced the awards ceremony on Wednesday, Nov. 18 prior to the Big South Tournament.
Senior middle blocker Jill Nyhof was named the 2009 Big South Scholar-Athlete of the Year for the second year in a row and teammate Sierra Livesay was named the 2009 Big South Freshman of the Year. Junior Chelsy Kimes earned First Team All-Big South honors and junior Megan Bickford earned Second Team honors.
Nyhof, who has a 4.0 grade-point average in political science, has played and started in every match except one this season and has been a huge contributor at the net. She is a two-time Big South Scholar-Athlete of the Year in 2008 and 2009 and an ESPN The Magazine First Team Academic All-District selection in 2008 and 2009 and Second Team honoree in 2007. She ranks second in Coastal Carolina history in career block assists with 312 and total blocks with 422 and had a career-high 13 blocks against Dayton in the first match of the season on Aug. 29. She is a two-time Big South Defensive Player of the Week and leads the Big South in blocks, averaging 1.28 blocks per set, having been ranked as high as second in the NCAA in blocks per set. Nyhof also earns her third All-Big South Academic Team honor.
Livesay has played in 28 matches and started 27 for the Chanticleers this season. She ranks second on the team in kills, averaging 2.44 kills per set, and ranks third in digs at 2.18 digs per set. She had a career-high 18 kills against Gardner-Webb Oct. 16 and is a two-time Big South Freshman of the Week honoree.
Kimes remains a lethal threat for the Chanticleers in the Big South, averaging 3.70 kills per set, leading the Chants and ranking fourth in the league. She enters the tournament sixth in the Coastal Carolina record book with 1,264 career kills and has had 25 double-digit kill matches, including 14 double-digit kill performances in a row this season. She also has had 15 double-doubles and the Chants are 11-4 when Kimes records a double-double. Kimes earns her second straight First Team All-Big South honor and was a Big South All-Freshman Team selection in 2007.
Bickford has been a consistent contributor all season for the Chanticleers, starting in every match this season. She has had the top hitting percentage on the team for the past three years, and ranks fifth in the Big South in the category this year with a .322 hitting percentage. She also ranks third on the team in kills per set at 2.30 and earned Big South Player of the Week honors Oct. 19. Bickford was an All-Big South Tournament team selection last season and a 2008 First Team All-Big South and an All-Freshman Team honoree in 2007.
In other Big South Awards, Winthrop's Kelley Taylor was named Player of the Year and UNC Asheville's Julie Torbett was Coach of the Year.
No. 4-seed Coastal Carolina will open the 2009 Big South Tournament Thursday, Nov. 19 against No. 5 High Point. The match is scheduled to start at 5 p.m. at the Dedmon Center in Radford.

Mark your calendars and start planning: Spring's almost here
Complaining about winter and all the hassles it brings is part of an Erieite's DNA.
It's also a waste of time: The snow is bound to fall and keep falling, sometimes into April, along with the mercury every year. As of Wednesday, Erie was the second-snowiest city in the Golden Snow Globe contest for cities larger than 100,000 people. The 82.1 inches that have fallen at Erie International Airport this season put us behind only Syracuse, N.Y., with 85.6 inches.
It's enough to make you want to hibernate.
But rejoice! Spring arrives March 20, or at least that's what the calendar promises.
Here's what I'm looking forward to:
- No more shoveling. Or snowblowing. Or scraping ice off the car. Is there a worse way to start the day?
- Eating ice cream at Sara's.
- Birds chirping.
- Packing away the sweaters, gloves, scarves and hats that threaten to bury me in a winter avalanche every time I open the living room closet. I'm ready for short sleeves and baseball games.
- Turning down the heat, throwing open the windows and airing out the house. I won't cry about the cheaper gas and electric bills, either.
- Walking Presque Isle without the parka.
- Gardening. I don't have a green thumb, but I'm going to try to make a few well-intentioned trips to local greenhouses anyway. Nothing says spring like flowers in the window boxes.
- Hitting the playground with the kiddo. We both have serious cases of cabin fever. I'm ready for the swings to reappear at Frontier Park. She's ready to run through sprinklers.
- Hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill. The smell of charcoal.
- No more mopping puddles left by snow boots on my kitchen floor.
What are you most looking forward to?

Who can I call about doing a mineral rights search? This is for LA.
Views: 1006
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply to This
There are about 5 properties that my grandmother, mineral rights rather..
The family found this out by accident. Going through her paperwork one day, we discovered that a company tried to buy her mineral rights to 5 sections of land. We figured we would do our own research.
We also figured this company would not have offered her money to buy mineral rights if she didn't have them. So this is why we are trying to find this info out.
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply
As an aside... While Ken Boone's grandmother may have known what she owned, she didn't convey that info to her heirs. I have created, for my family, a "land book" that has a section devoted to every piece of land I own, no matter how tiny. In that book I note what I own (and include maps), names and contact information for any other joint owners, what (if anything) is under lease (oil, gas, lignite, pipeline ROWs), how I came to own it (purchase, inheritance), and anything that might occur in the future (prescription, expiration of leases, timber cuttings) that my heirs would need to know about. I also included copies of all past deeds, leases, contracts, division orders, etc. If everyone would create such a book and keep it up to date, it would make life easier for one's heirs. JMHO.
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply
Great post, Henry! I suggest that you make it the topic of a Main Page discussion. Everyone who owns mineral interests beyond the size of a residential lot should have a book.
Agreed.
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply
I went to the Panola County deed records and researched my ownership from 1911 to current date. It took about six hours so take a snack and drink for a break. But I can tell you I found the land men and researchers there very helpful. The room was a beehive of activity. It was also very interesting looking thru the old conveyances. I would have gone to the wills but found it was not necessary. Found what I needed. I had/have an O&G attorney but by researching it myself saved hundreds of dollars. It just happened that the landman walked in as I was leaving and I told him what I had found, he called his office and within minutes the "problem" of my interests was solved.
The oil companies do make mistakes.
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply
And public records are not always correct or complete. Better to discover omissions or mistakes with a chain of title and fix it before it potentially becomes a problem. In the land business they call it title curative. One common problem is that a succession or judgement of possession is recorded in the county/parish where the owner died but not in the county/parish where the mineral estate is located. Heirs should get a certified copy of that instrument and have it recorded in the additional jurisdiction.

History suggests U.S. Open is Tiger's to lose
- By Doug Ferguson
- Jun 16, 2012 3:53 PM ET
SAN FRANCISCO – The expectations came back before Tiger Woods did.
For the longest time, there was a sense of inevitability about Woods when he was in front going into the weekend at a major championship. Eight times he had the outright lead after 36 holes, and eight times he went on to win, a streak that Y.E. Yang finally ended in 2009 at the PGA Championship.
The circumstances were slightly different Saturday at the U.S. Open.
This was the first time Woods has shared the lead at a major going into the third round, and the other leaders have some experience.
Jim Furyk won the U.S. Open nine years ago at Olympia Fields, where he had a chance to set the 72-hole scoring record until meaningless bogeys on the last two holes. David Toms is 11 years removed from his lone major at the PGA Championship, though not quickly forgotten is the resolve he showed. With the gallery one-sided in its support of Phil Mickelson, Toms laid up on the 18th hole at Atlanta Athletic Club and made a 12-foot par to win.
The other difference?
This is 2012.
Woods removed his cap on the putting green Thursday, revealing an increasingly receding hair line. That was always going to be a losing battle, though it was a subtle reminder that Woods is not the 24-year-old who completed the career Grand Slam at St. Andrews, nor was this the 30-year-old who won consecutive majors.
He is 36.
He has gone through four operations on his left knee.
He has gone through public scrutiny of a very private life.
In some respects, this week could be the start of a new era for Woods, who will always be compared against his old era.
This business of the ''new Tiger'' looking like the ''old Tiger'' needs to stop, for no other reason than the new Tiger is older. For all this talk about whether Woods is really back, he has won two times this year on the PGA Tour, and that's as many as anyone else. Woods won five times in 2003 and it used to be called a slump because it didn't include a major championship.
So now Woods is among the leaders going into the third round at The Olympic Club, and the expectations are that he will win the U.S. Open for a record-tying fourth time, and finally get to his 15th major in his delayed pursuit of Jack Nicklaus.
Woods' mother is at Olympic this week, and she rarely goes anywhere but the Masters and Honda Classic, her new home. Maybe she's onto something.
Then again, it's hard to imagine Woods not expecting the same thing.
If a 70 in the U.S. Open at Olympic is equivalent to a 66 at a regular PGA Tour event, then this would be a stretch of golf that should get some attention. He closed with a 67 to win at Memorial, then joined Furyk and Toms as the only players who have not gone over par this week.
''It's one thing to have a game plan, but you also have to execute the game plan,'' Woods said. ''And I think that's one of the reasons why I was so excited about how I hit the ball at Memorial,.''
Perhaps it helps that he has two players whose game he admires joining him as the only golfers who remain under par.
Woods thinks so much of the Furyk's toughness that he finally got his wish to have Furyk as a partner in the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup. A few years ago, Woods was presented one of those age-old hypothetical questions: If his life depended on someone making a 15-foot putt, and he couldn't pick himself or Nicklaus, which player would he choose? Among the names he eventually mentioned was Toms.
The lesser-known players have proved far more dangerous over the years.
Bob May took him to a playoff at Valhalla in the 2000 PGA Championship. Woods had to hole one of the biggest putts of his life at Torrey Pines just to get into a U.S. Open playoff with Rocco Mediate in 2008, and he still had to go 19 holes to beat him. Rich Beem didn't blink when he beat Woods in the PGA Championship at Hazeltine. Yang remains the only player to win a major when Woods had the lead going into final round.
His former caddie, Steve Williams, once said that what looked like the easiest of Sundays felt like one of the hardest. He was talking about the Buick Open in 2009. Woods went into the final round with a one-shot lead over a group of players that made it look like a Nationwide Tour leaderboard. Only two of the seven guys behind him had won on Tour, and none was ranked among the top 100.
The tournament, in the eyes of everyone except the players, was over.
Woods is not at that stage yet, though Saturday could go a long way toward raising the expectations even higher. Woods is known for closing on Sunday, but he traditionally has set himself up for the win on Saturday.

Which pro-am is better: Alfred Dunhill or Pebble Beach?
- By Randall Mell
- Oct 6, 2012 9:00 AM ET
With plenty of celebrity and tradition on both sides of the pond, the GolfChannel.com team debates the better pro-am: AT&T Pebble Beach or the Alfred Dunhill Championship?

Even if you don’t like golf, walking along the fairways during the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am is anything but a good walk spoiled.
Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods all played at Pebble Beach, but they never made contact more spectacularly than the way the surf hits the rocks in Stillwater Cove. The old Crosby Clambake will never lose its charm because of that, no matter which stars show up.
There are few vistas in the game as stunning as the tee box at Pebble Beach’s seventh hole, the shortest tough hole in golf. The views on the eighth and 18th tee boxes are not bad either.
The Alfred Dunhill Links Championship also offers some special settings with St. Andrews and Carnoustie among the courses the event is played upon. There is no more sacred ground in golf than the Old Course, but Pebble Beach feels as if it takes you to heaven's doorstep. Robert Louis Stevenson didn’t call it “The most felicitous meeting of land and sea in creation” for nothing.

Athletes want to be rock stars and rock stars want to be athletes. Blondes want to be brunettes and brunettes want to be blondes. (And yes, some of us just want hair.) The point is, as Mick Jagger has been screeching for decades, you can’t always get what you want.
The grass is always greener on the other side. Unless, of course, the other side happens to include a three-course rotation of St. Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns, where faded fairways and brownish greens are not only the norm, but perfectly acceptable.
It only makes sense that a British golfer would long for the lush shorefront real estate of the Monterey Peninsula, just as an American secretly craves the hallowed ground of Scotland’s yards. You won’t find me bellyaching about the majestic California courses, but given my choice of whether to compete in the grandest stateside pro-am or the coolest overseas edition, I’ll take the latter and run with it – for as far as my punched 2-iron will take me on those vaunted links.
Kingsbarns is the most awe-inspiring “new” course I’ve ever had the pleasure of visiting; Carnoustie is a dreaded beast best left untamed and St. Andrews is, well, it’s St. Andrews – and if that simple explanation isn’t enough to get you salivating, then you clearly haven’t been paying attention these last couple of centuries.
So give me that 2-iron in a romp over a hybrid. Give me another pint at The Dunvegan in a 1-up victory over a cocktail in The Tap Room. Give me the Dunhill Links by the smallest of margins over the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
Maybe someday it’ll happen. After all, you can’t always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.

With a monsoon of respect to the home of golf and Auld Grey Toon, there is only one Clambake and only one pro-am that is a must-see, or must-play if one is lucky enough to merit a tee time.
What the Old Course and St. Andrews enjoy in historical significance, Pebble Beach makes up for with postcard views, an “A” list of celebrities and a rejuvenated rotation of courses that is second to none.
Iconic Pebble Beach has always been the centerpiece of the annual PGA Tour stop, but in 2010 Monterey Peninsula Country Club was added to the “Crosby” rotation and may be, according to many a Tour frat brother, a better golf course. By comparison Carnoustie and Kingsbarn, the other two courses in the Dunhill Links rota, are consolation prizes.
While neither event enjoys a world-class field, other than Bill Murray – whose shtick seems lost on the U.K. galleries – the Dunhill lacks the star power that Pebble Beach enjoys.
And if that wasn’t enough, consider the weather. For all the annual hand-wringing over “Crosby weather,” Pebble Beach has enjoyed Chamber of Commerce-like conditions in recent years. By comparison, on Saturday at St. Andrews the morning groups will tee off in breezy conditions with temperatures in the 40s.
There is no place better than St. Andrews in July, at the Open Championship, but when it comes to a pro-am, Pebble Beach is the gold standard.

New Nightclub Laws Make Downtown Safer
Saturday, July 23, 2011
When college students all over Providence return to campus next month, they will undoubtedly kick off their years with trips to the city’s many nightclubs and bars. But they could face stricter guidelines when it comes to places they’ll have access to and they will be following a different set of rules than they’ve become accustomed to.
That’s because both the city and the General Assembly passed laws this summer in an attempt to control both underage drinking and the violence that occurs when the bars close early each weekend morning.
Now, bars and nightclubs that fail to prevent underage patrons from consuming alcohol can be barred from having events that cater to young people under the age of 21. In addition, the city has decided to stagger closing times for clubs in a response to a series of melees that took place in part because of the overcrowded downtown area after 2:00am on the weekend.
Underage Drinking Bill
The underage drinking bill in the General Assembly was sponsored by Rep. Chris Blazejewski. His legislation, which was signed into law by Governor Chafee last week, is meant to encourage establishments to comply with laws concerning alcohol and to directly prevent minors from accessing alcohol by shutting off an easy source.
“If nightclubs can’t control underage drinking, it doesn’t make sense to let them admit underage people,” said Blazejewski. “The licensing board needs these tools to respond to violations both as a means of enforcement and for the safety of patrons and the public, especially in light of recent violence at or near some Providence nightclubs.”
Because of the high number of college students in the area, Providence has always been known as a place where the underage crowd could find a place to acquire alcohol. With many clubs promoting 18-and-up nights and some bars failing to ask for identification at the door, students have seen the city as an easy place to drink illegally.
Places Have A Reputation For Serving Underage Crowd
The result, often times, has been trouble for the city at closing time. Fights break out. Intoxicated people get behind the wheel. Downtown becomes a major traffic jam.
Under the new law, the places known for allowing underage drinking will likely enforce stricter guidelines so they can continue to allow young people to at least enter their place of business.
“Places that have a proven reputation for serving minors become magnets for those who are underage and want to drink,” said Providence Senator Harold Metts. “That reputation is actually a competitive advantage, bringing more people to that club to drink and spend money. Not only are they violating the law, but they’re making a profit as a direct result of that illegal activity.”
State Rep. Joy Hearn echoed her colleague’s thoughts. She said establishments known for serving underage drinkers should be punished.
“If we are serious about preventing underage drinking, we can’t let those who repeatedly serve minors continue to invite them into their clubs,” she said. “Those establishments have already shown they are either unable or unwilling to stop them from drinking, so they shouldn’t be allowed to let them though the door.”
Staggered Closing Time
The new underage drinking law comes shortly after Providence decided to stagger closing times for nightclubs throughout the downtown area. The decision came after rival gangs got into a shootout shortly after the bars closed one night last month. Shots rang out and sent hundreds of clubgoers into a panic.
Now, almost a dozen downtown nightclubs are permitted to stay open until 3:00am on weekend nights, with drink service still ending at 2:00am. The city hopes the changes will alleviate some of the congestion that takes place downtown and possibly, some of the crime.
But will it work?
“I think it will make for less of a traffic jam downtown,” said Kevin Hoffman, a Providence student from the West End. “I’m not sure about the crime. As long as there is alcohol, there will probably be crime.”

I’ve been writing about the possibility of hyperinflation, if there is ever a run on Treasury bonds. My argument has been, Treasuries are the New & Improved Toxic Assets, a termite-riddled house waiting to collapse. If and when there is a run on them, money will flow to a safe haven, which I am predicting will be commodities. As a byproduct of this sell off in Treasuries and buy up of commodities, consumer prices will rise catastrophically in a hyperinflationary event—and the dollar will be left dead on the highway like roadkill.
This scenario got me thinking about the last time there was a panicked run-up in commodities: The stagflation of the 1970’s in the United States, specifically the period 1979–1983. Oil nearly doubled in price, gold and silver went hyperbolic. Gas shortages were rampant—the situation almost got to the point where the government considered rationing gasoline. In fact, ration cards were printed—that’s how bad things got.
Because of the Oil Shock, the inflation index rose to a peak of 15%—yet unemployment also exploded, reaching almost 11%. This combination of unemployment and inflation was what gave the period its name—stagflation: “Stagnant inflation”.
Because of the Oil Shock, the inflation index rose to a peak of 15%—yet unemployment also exploded, reaching almost 11%. This combination of unemployment and inflation was what gave the period its name—stagflation: “Stagnant inflation”.
Thinking about this period, I asked myself a simple question: Could the ‘79 Oil Shock, and subsequent bout of stagflation, be better understood as a period of incipient hyperinflation? And if so, what lessons could it teach us about today?
First, a bit of history:.
This event naturally led to oil prices ballooning, from a nominal average of $15 per barrel in 1978, to $25 per barrel in 1979 (data is here). This had a profound impact on inflation throughout the American and world economies.
Up to the overthrow of the Shah, the U.S. inflation index had been at a moderate-to-high plateau. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) averaged 6.5% during all of 1977 and for the first third of 1978.
But in the lead-up to the Revolution and the subsequent overthrow of the Shah, inflation got in high gear: For the rest of 1978, inflation averaged 8.13%, and by March of ‘79—two months after the Iranian oil supply was disrupted—inflation was tracking at over 10% annually. By the end of 1979, average inflation for the year was 11.22%, and by March of 1980, inflation was peaking just shy of 15% (data is here.)
That was also the winter when gold and silver took off in parallel speculative jags that reached all-time highs—that winter was retrospectively the peak of inflation in the United States.
Keep that date in mind: March of 1980. Annualized inflation: 15%.
Though the inflation index was rising, unemployment hardly budged for a full year after the Oil Shock. Unemployment was at 5.9% when the Shah was overthrown in January of ‘79. And during the rest of ‘79—even though oil prices skyrocketed and the attendant inflation swept the economy—U.S. unemployment was more or less steady at or below 6%—
—until 1980: Starting that winter, unemployment bumped up to 6.9%, and it didn't look back. Unemployment would eventually reach a plateau of 10%, and stay at that plateau for a whole year (July 1982 to June 1983), peaking at 10.8% in November of ‘82.
Though unemployment would slowly fall, it wouldn’t be until September of 1987—almost nine years after the start of the crisis—before it reached its pre-Oil Shock level of 5.9% (unemployment data is here).
But during those years—nearly a decade, really—of staggering unemployment, what happened to inflation?
Well, in a word, it got a stake driven through its black heart—but like all scary movies, it was a close call.
Inflation got killed as dead as Dillinger because of the measures taken by Paul Volcker, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
As can be seen by the chart, up until Volcker was named Fed Chairman in August of ‘79, Federal Reserve interest rate policy was playing a game of catch-up with inflation—and inflation was winning.
But in October of ‘79, Volcker raised the Fed funds rate to 12% in the so-called “Saturday Night Special”—and then kept on raising them. Volcker kept the Fed funds rate up above 15% for most of 1980 and ‘81, peaking at 19.1%.
That’s right: 19.1%. It shocks the senses to look at that number, and then compare it to the current Fed funds rate of 0.25%.
From the graphic, it’s crystal clear that unemployment jumped up as a result of the first harsh taste of Volcker rates—in January, three months after the first interest rate hit, unemployment jumped to 6.3%, held steady there through the winter, then jumped to 6.9% in April and 7.5% in May. Then it just kept on climbing after that.
Essentially, Volcker induced a severe recession, in order to beat back inflation. There’s really no other way to look at it. Like a doctor administering chemotherapy, Volcker hiked interest rates high enough to kill the cancerous inflation—but he also killed business investment as well, during his reign of double-digit interest rates.
But all’s well that ends well—eventually, when inflation was safely taken care of, the Fed lowered its funds rate: Investment returned, the economy picked up, unemployment went down.
And inflation? It went into remission, after Dr. Paul’s tough medicine. Since the stagflation period and its successful treatment, inflation as measured by the CPI numbers has been basically a non-issue.
Now, let’s double-back to take a closer look at what happened back in 1979, and how it might compare to our situation today in 2010:
(A quick note on terms—by the word “inflation”, I mean two distinct things: One is the macro-economic event whereby prices rise, due to the expansion of both the economy and the credit environment, which bids up the prices of consumables. This sense is used in opposition to the other three macro-economic events, deflation, disinflation, and hyperinflation. The other meaning of the word “inflation”—or what I sometimes call the inflation index or sometimes the CPI number—is simply the actual percentage rise in prices in an economy, regardless of whether the cause is inflationary or hyperinflationary.)
The cause of the rampant inflation of ‘79–‘81 was an oil shock. It wasn’t that the economy was overheating, and consumables (labor and commodities) were being bid up in a growing economy coupled with an expansionary credit environment. Rather, commodities were rising against the dollar—the market was turning on the dollar, and determining that every day, it was worth less vis-à-vis commodities.
What was happening was that, in a very real sense, the dollar was going into a death spiral, when Paul Volcker implemented his psychotically aggressive interest rates.
What was happening was that, in a very real sense, the dollar was going into a death spiral, when Paul Volcker implemented his psychotically aggressive interest rates.
Note how money supply played no role whatsoever in the inflationary period 1978–1983. Consider the following table:
Increase in the money supply was both inverse to high inflation levels some years (like Jan. ‘75) and inverse to relatively low inflation levels in other years (like Jan. ‘77). But it also tracked high inflation levels other years (Jan. ‘82) as well as low inflation levels in still other years (Jan. ‘86)..
When inflation was indisputably on the rampage—1980—money supply had increased by a mere 8.34%: The low end of the curve. Yet inflation that year was over 13%—even in the teeth of Volcker’s medicine..
Had Volcker not applied his medicine, ever-spiraling commodity prices would have sent inflationary tsunamis throughout the U.S. economy—until eventually, there would have been a run on the dollar. If CPI numbers had ever crossed 20% or 25% or some other psychologically important (and so far unknown) number, then it would have been Game Over for the dollar—Zimbabwe/Weimar absurdities would not have been far behind, because there would have been a complete loss of faith in the dollar: After all, a fiat currency is only as strong as the belief it inspires in its holders.
The conclusion is therefore obvious: Paul Volcker prevented hyperinflation from happening in the United States. Had inflation continued rising unabated, the dollar would have collapsed—which would have meant the collapse of the U.S. economy, much as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
If Paul Volcker were a rock star, then I'd be a screaming 15 year-old girl—Tall Paul is my hero. One cannot overstate the political will and strength of character it must have taken for Paul Volcker to resist all the calls to cut interest rates—which were a hysterical clamor, at the time. Had he caved, the Cold War would not have been won, and so our world would be much, much different—for the worse. Those like myself who know this, know how much we owe him—which is why we respect him. As far as I am concerned, he ought to have a white marble statue thirty feet high, placed prominently on the Mall in Washington, D.C., eye to eye with the other great heroes of the Republic. He earned it.
Now, let’s ask ourselves: Was this near-catastrophe Paul Volcker saved us from back in 1979 really a case of incipient hyperinflation?
Many people have been using a throwaway line I wrote as a definition of hyperinflation: “Hyperinflation is the loss of faith in the currency.” If I do say so myself, it’s a nice line—but it’s inaccurate.
Hyperinflation is a severe price distortion, that eventually leads to a loss of faith in the currency. In every hyperinflationary event, CPI numbers rise as the prices of consumer necessities rise. Their prices rise for different reasons—which for this discussion are myriad and irrelevant. But what is relevant is, eventually, such price rises skewer the overall economy.
One of the key distortions that hyperinflation inflicts is price distortions on assets, be they equities, bonds or real-estate. By creating a run-up in consumer prices, hyperinflation imbalances the whole of the economy, making bonds, equities and real assets less valuable. This effect has been observed in every undisputed hyperinflationary episode.
So apart from the severe rise in CPI numbers between ‘79 and ‘82, was there such a hyperinflationary fall in asset prices in the United States?”.
(By the way, this gives lie to the notion common among money supply fetishists that “there aren’t enough dollars in the economy to ever start hyperinflation”—of course there are enough dollars: We saw it in ‘79. Money supply has got nothing to do with hyperinflation. Where there is a shortage or need for a good or commodity, the economy will rebalance itself to meet this new demand. In simple terms, people will somehow always find the cash to purchase their necessities, whatsoever price those necessities might reach. And if the market—for whatever reason—determines that a currency is worth consistently less against the same amount of commodities, then that currency is circling the hyperinflationary drain. The central bank need not inject more money to bring about this end—it can happen without recourse to money printing, or any other central bank or governmental measure.)
Now all of this history is well and good—but how does it apply to the situation we find ourselves in today, in 2010?
Very simple: I have been arguing that Treasury bonds are in a bubble, as they have become the New & Improved Toxic Assets. I have further argued that, at some point in the future, the markets will realize that Treasuries will never be repayed, and if they are, they will be repaid in debased dollars. Therefore, I have argued that when such a realization occurred, the markets would begin exiting Treasuries, and go to commodities as a safe haven.
Contrast this with 1979: At the start of the ’79 Oil Shock, commodity prices rose because dollars were chasing commodities. These dollars weren’t fleeing from Treasury bonds—if they left Treasuries, it was simply as a byproduct of going towards commodities. As more and more dollars went towards commodities, those commodities bid themselves up, creating inflation.
So in a practical sense, the period we are living in now and the period just before the Oil Shock are identical: In both cases, dollars were poised to chase after commodities, following a triggering event. In ‘79, it was the fall of the Shah. In 2010, we are waiting for our moment to exit Treasuries.
Therefore, one can look at the events of ’79–’82 as a dress rehearsal for what I think will happen today, and in the immediate future, if and when the Treasury bond bubble pops:
Like in ‘79, there will be a crisis that will trigger a run on commodities. Like ’79, the inflation index will start to pick up. Like ‘79, this will create hyperinflationary distortions in the American economy, which will be seen at least initially as “stagflation”.
In my previous writings, I had originally thought that, when the moment arrived when markets lost faith in Treasury bonds, commodities would go hyperbolic immediately, or within a very short time frame.
However, studying the events of ‘79 more closely, I realize I was wrong: I now no longer think commodity prices will spike hyperbolically and in a reduced time frame. I now think commodity prices—and CPI numbers—will rise initially at an accelerated clip, say at an annualized rate of 5–6% in the first month.
But here is the tragedy: Increased inflation will not be perceived—at least not at first—as anything to get into a twist over. Each subsequent month will see an inflationary rise at a slightly faster pace, adding a percent or two a month to the annualized rate—but at least at first, not only will this not be perceived as anything worrisome, it will be considered a good thing: Because of the current deflationary recession we are in, any pick up in the inflation index will be interpreted as a pick up in the overall economy.
Eventually, however, as inflation continues to rise but the jobs market doesn’t really improve, the current American economy will wake up and find it has reached the exact same point that was reached back in March of 1980—a 15% annual inflation rate.
But here is the key difference: Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve cannot raise rates to reign in incipient hyperinflation, like Volcker did in ‘79..
Bernanke doesn’t realize that inflation is a symptom that can augur many things. He is convinced that inflation means growth—the opposite of deflation. So all his liquidity windows, all his cash infusions to prop up the Too Big To Fail banks and their bankster operators, QE, QE-lite, the forthcoming QE2—all of it is being carried out by Bernanke so as to cause inflation. He is convinced that inflation will signal that the economy is recovering, and that the Federal Debt will be inflated away, and therefore not break the Federal government finances.
He believes that rising prices will mean that the U.S. economy is about to be saved.
This is why Bernanke is set up to take a hit from hyperinflation: If and when there is a run on Treasuries, and a subsequent run up of commodities, at least initially, the Federal Reserve under Ben Bernanke will not only do nothing, they will encourage this situation. The Fed and its current leadership will interpret this rise in the CPI number as an indication that “We are on the road to recovery!”
We are not: The first hint of commodity prices rising as the Treasury markets begin to fade will be an indication that hyperinflation is on its way. And by the time we get to our March 1980 moment—by the time we get to 15% annualized inflation index—it will be over.
The next stop will be Zimbabwe.
Well, this is a very BLEAK picture.
But - if possible - the situation of Mr Bernanke is even WORSE than that described above.
This is because the measures of unemployment of the present ARE NOT the same of the measures of thirty years ago ... today the unemployment is ALREADY FAR ABOVE 10% IF MEASURED WITH THE STANDARDS OF THIRTY YEARS AGO ...
Gonzalo, I've really enjoyed reading your series on hyperinflation but you've lost me here on the comparison to '79.
Volker is certainly hero as far as recent U.S. history is concerned (and it's a shame that he doesn't have a stronger voice in the current administration) but let's not lionize him as the savior of the free world. You haven't made a convincing case that we were on the edge of the abyss in 79-80. Why would 20% + inflation in the early 80's been the end of the world? What were the alternatives to the U.S. $ at the time? Remember winning the Cold War was an enormous objective. This objective had far more clarity than say winning the "war on terrorism" of today.
My guess is prolonging inflation in the 80's would have been bad but not disasterous. We would have muddled through. Our economy at the time - even with sharply accelerating inflation - was still far more productive than the economy in the USSR. The baby boomer generation was starting to move into their working prime. Perhaps stubbornly high oil prices would have pushed us more quickly to energy alternatives. Perhaps Reagan would have been a one-termer. I don't see how basic history would have changed. Capital would have found productive inputs.
That last point segways to our current problem - accumulated years (or even decades perhaps) of applying our excess capital (essentially the boomer generation savings) into unproductive inputs. The first bubble - the tech craze - was the least damaging. Author Michael Lewis has writen a pretty good case that the bubble actually boosted productivity in a number of ways - remember Global Crossing wrapping the world in fiber optic cables? Anyway, we decided to move our capital into housing. Unless you open a farm, a house provides little net value-added to the economy, no matter how many garages you have. Instead of writing that off, we passed that hot potato to the U.S. Treasury. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury was busy collecting its own inventory of useless junk - counterproductive wars, counterproductive health plans, etc. We've "consolidated" all are credit card loans to one place. Given that capital now moves at the speed of light - literally - this is unprecedented in world history. It's certainly much different that 1979.
As Spengler predicted, politics eventually destroys the money system.
Well written. One thing I would add to Bernanke's psyche is that he is not only trying to cause inflation, but he is trying to induce a wealth effect by driving up equity and asset prices.
Clearly this has thus far not worked, as outflows from equity mutual funds have been non-stop and housing overhang is resulting in a resumed price decline.
Thanks for your clear thoughts.
Great article. I have to agree with you 100%. I wrote something just the other day saying pretty much the same thing, just not as eloquently as you did.

It is going to be very ugly when everything starts pouring into commodities. God help us all.
Gonzalo,
This scenario is extremely plausible. I think you hit the nail on the head when you said "Bernanke thoroughly believes that only liquidity injections and cheap money can save the economy—he is looking for inflation".
As Bill Gross told us in August 2009:
"Reflating nominal GDP by inflating asset prices is the fundamental, yet infrequently acknowledged, goal of policymakers. If they can do that, then employment and economic stability may ultimately follow."
I emphasize that Gross used the words IF and MAY, not when and will!

John Hussman's Aug. 23, 2010 commentary "Why Quantitative Easing is Likely to Trigger a Collapse of the U.S. Dollar" on this topic was excellent.
Hussman:
"My impression is that Ben Bernanke has little sense of the damage he is about to provoke. A central banker who talks about throwing money from helicopters is not only arrogant but foolish."
Later in the commentary, Hussman:
."
The emphasis in capitals is mine.

Right on Gonzalo. That was a bomb of an article.
Gonzalo:
It's great to hear you reference this period in our history..... I was a floor broker at the CEC and a partner at a small boutique IB/TH.... I lived that period at my trading desk in lower Manhattan and in the silver, gold and sugar rings at the CEC in the WTC at the COMEX and the NYCS&C Exch.
Those were truly memorable times and I reference them regularly as a parallel to this state of affairs we're in today....
In this latest post, I believe that you have articulated some adjustments in the synthesis of your theoretical forecasts, that fall much more in line with my own.
Correct me if I'm wrong.... However, I see you moving more towards the hyper-inflationary scenario in the deflationary context school of thought. That is precisely what I have positioned myself for in the markets. I wholeheartedly agree with you that treasuries are bubblelicious. Gold, silver and sugar (I consider sugar to be the agricultural currency) are undervalued. And equities as a matter of fact and not perception, are well overvalued. I'm not going to touch oil for reasons that I can't go into at the moment, however, I do anticipate that the price of oil will move much higher later in the cycle.
To those who have a blind spot to your measured and well thought out theories, all I can say is GOOD LUCK....
Best regards,
Econolicious
Well said. Even now we can watch the price of silver as reflecting exactly what you are arguing.

Gonzalo,
In my opinion the oil supply played a key role in helping Paul Volcker fight back inflation. I'm going out on a limb here, I don't have the numbers to back this up, but at the beginning of the 80s the world still had plenty of untapped supplies, starting with Saudi Arabia. The USA used their political pull to nudge Saudi Arabia, as well as other befriended Middle East states, to produce more, which was instrumental in diminishing the pressure on commodities and reinforcing the faith in the dollar. Later on, the North Sea discoveries were also a huge factor in helping the western world, especially the UK, fuel a new economic boom.
In other words, Paul Volcker could count on the fact that the oil supply disruption were temporary and politically induced. There was no "peak" situation in any commodity like today, no peak oil, no peak gold, no peak copper or iridium...
It's absolutely not the same for Bernanke now. On the contrary, the constraints on the oil supply are now almost entirely geological, and we know that in the coming years world oil production will gradually decline. It is very unlikely that new discoveries will save the Western economies at the 11th hour.
Gonzalo,
disappointed you didn't mention that Volcker was one of the 'advisers' that took the US off the gold standard and started the mess in the first place !
Vincent said:
"...in the coming years world oil production will gradually decline. It is very unlikely that new discoveries will save the Western economies at the 11th hour."
I think you're right Vincent that oil will no longer be available "cheap" - not necessarily because there couldn't be new discoveries but because $150 oil was an ominous warning that world demand is increasing faster than supply.
We could avoid the disaster at that 11th hour by recognizing NOW that the price of oil will surely go up; and setting federal policy to encourage us toward alternatives (rather than waiting for the regular demand/supply forces to bring about that change).
The good news is that when oil-based energy triples in price, from where it is now (ie, $10 gasoline), then virtually all alternatives will become viable. [Based on this I see a $300-$400 ceiling on oil.]
The bad news is that the US is at the very bottom in creating a *stable-energy-policy* (one that isn't blocked by politics or changed every 2-4 years).
I view a well-thought-out AND *stable-energy-policy* to be MORE IMPORTANT than almost all other issues facing our economy.
If all US consumers of oil-based-energy knew that oil would gradually become less viable as an energy choice (perhaps every 3 months there could be a small tax-increase on each barrel of oil extracted/imported, over a 10-year period), then individuals and businesses would develop their plans accordingly. There would be no need for CAFE standards, or other heavy-handed methods. With a known energy policy, consumers would know how choose, and capitalists could do what they do best: be capitalists!
[Note: I prefer government "encouragement" in the form of gradually-implemented taxes, rather than passing out subsidies chosen by bureaucrats that have no capitalist incentive (and possibly corrupt motives).]
Alas, it will probably not happen that way, I expect to see a disaster (either/both of dollar-destruction and war) long before the US adopts a "stable-energy-policy".

PS - my apologies for getting a bit off-subject.
Two comments on currency:
Consumers tend to have little plastic printing presses in their back pockets. An expectation of price hikes on commodities will probably send a lot of us to Costco, to stock up using our credit cards. The collective balance on those cards will then be an asset which the card issuers can leverage for further cash flow. This might result in some sudden inflationary events; the first crowd-sourced devaluation, if you will.
It's also interesting to consider USPS "forever" stamps as portable, exchangeable, commodity-backed currency. Their nominal price hasn't gone up much, recently, but I could imagine people using them to store some small amount of value. It's probably of academic interest that postage stamps are backed by a commodity service rather than a commodity good, and a service tied so closely to transportation fuel prices. It's very interesting that the USPS chose to de-couple from the US dollar when they did.
Where's Mish...? :-)
I like the poster above who suggested the imperative and 'clarity' we had in 'winning' the Cold War...
We spent a lot of money, that's for certain. But in the context of of the old Soviet Union, vs. the New & improved FSB, what did we win? In terms of their still-existing partnerships with 'terrorists' (like Iran & Syria), and fellow travelers (like Red China), what have we 'won'?
The Russians still have nuclear weapons - and other armaments that are equal or superior to ours. And they're building...
We didn't 'win' anything. And the Russians are still 'Soviets' in many aspects. And Putin still runs the country.
Another piece of re-written history that needs to be un-re-written and put back in its proper context...
I disagree with you not one iota. "Tall Paul" deserved a tremendous amount of credit. However, you failed to mention the name of Ronald Reagan once much less B. H. Obama. President Reagan backed Volker throughout this entire period and took the political heat. On t
he other hand you have the "annointed one".

Comparing the remains of the US today to the 1970s may be optimistic.
Problem with this analysis is that there was no oil supply shock. The dollar price of oil increased but the gold/oil ratio (the real price of oil) was fairly steady at between 1/13 and 1/15. So the reason the oil price doubled is because the gold price doubled. The price of gold pulled the price of oil up with it. The exact same thing is going on today.
Gonzalo, your thesis that a selloff of US Treasuries will lead to a commodity bubble should be tested against the more recent history in 2007 and 2008. At that time, we had a commodity bubble with oil prices approaching $150 per barrel. There are people who believe that the following collapse of commodity prices (oil prices fell all the way down to $40 per barrel) was initiated by Paulson and Bernanke in order to prevent a Dollar hyperinflation. Regardless whether true or not, the fact is, that oil prices did collapse (even gold fell 20%) and money started to flow into US Treasuries. The Treasury bubble is still going on with no end in sight.
The question therefore is: If Treasuries sellout and money flows again into commodities, why can the trick of 2008 not be repeated and a huge sellout of commodities be forced upon the market? It would be enough to convince a few large hedge funds to sell out their commodity positions. That is was happened in 2008.
I don't think that commodities would have gone any further than they did and it is not clear to me that Volcker's actions were completely necessary.
Gold price rose, reflecting a loss of faith in the dollar--this much is true. However, the gold price hit its (up to that time) all-time intraday high of $875/oz at which point the US treasury obligations were fully backed by the bullion that the US held. At that point, the US was solvent again, and with short rates at 19% it was extremely tempting to leave gold and move back into treasuries, which is what happened.
If interest rates had been somewhat lower, the situation would have been the same. The key event was the pricing of gold at a level sufficient to back US obligations.
Of course, now those obligations are so large compared to the gold held by the US (which is unknown without an audit) so the same fix will occur at a presently unknown gold price.
While I think you've made an admirable attempt here, it seems to me that you're taking the relevant context too narrowly to get a full picture. It seems to me that, while the oil may have been a catalyst, there were far more basic reasons for the occurrence of stagflation in the '70s and '80s, namely the fact that this was the start of the period in which American manufacturing could no longer compete with Asian companies, where the US capitalist class was taking its investment capital. This could not be fixed, however, because of the - at the time - counterproductive labor unions, which prevented wage adjustments and other changes that might've made american businesses more competitive, and because of US subsidization of the car industry through gas price subsidies etc., which allowed US auto makers to ignore the fact that their cars were obsolete. In this and similar ways, protectionism and unions caused the stagflation.. But while the problem today is still the fact that US manufacturing cannot compete, this is no longer because of labor, as we know that the US worker has not had an inflation-adjusted wage increase since the mid-70s.. The problem lies entirely with the capitalists who are no longer interested in making sure their consumers earn wages which they can then use to buy goods with, and in stead asked Greenspan to make it happen that US consumers could borrow and fund their consumption that way, which he promptly did.
Anyway, parts (higher-educated workers) of the US workforce are still competitive, and other parts have become more or less competitive by now, so I don't think hyperinflation would've been a very likely outcome, but it seems to me that the stagflation From The Perspective of the (lower) Middle Class has never really abated, but it is only in the last few years or so that people have started noticing this - a fact that is absolutely pathetic. As for now, I doubt that inflation will really happen, as all the QE has not led to a marked increase in M1/M2, and it is disadvantageous in the extreme for the rich to own a devaluating currency.
Huh? what gold, backing what dollar?
have you not learned that Nixon got mad at France in 71 and abandoned the gold standard, refusing to honor the pledge to exchange gold for dollars at the rate of $35 per once.
Best I know, that policy is still in effect.
if the truth is your best friend, why did'nt you post my comments on the federal reserve? are you in denial? its ok, you figure you will be squashed if you naysay the fed. but just for youself - try to identify the shareholders of the fed. It's the best kept secret since dealy plaza.
Don't forget that some of the PM leaps up were connected to the Hunt's efforts at cornering the silver market. They might have made it and the price of silver hit the moon but the exchange rules were changed which shot down both silver and gold. If that large-economy cheating didn't happen, it's interesting to speculate what might have happened.
"In simple terms, people will somehow always find the cash to purchase their necessities, whatsoever price those necessities might reach."
Can you please explain your rationale for this statement? Exactly what is the "somehow" people use to find cash to buy necessities when they are unemployed and their bennies have run out.
Inflation can only persist if the consumer has money to spend. Reality check Gonzalo, the consumer is ALREADY BK. Prices go up any more, people will not buy at those prices, necessity or not. They will steal it, they won;t be ABLE to buy it.
Deflation all the way my friend.
RE
Deflation all the way to where?
The problem with the deflationists' argument for me is that I have never heard a convincing outcome to the deflationary period.
Please, could a deflationista describe what they see is the endgame to the deflationary period, if it isn't hyper-intflation/currency death?
Thankyou in advance
In the late 1970's Gold nearly doubled from around $400.00 after the Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan. Also, one of the largest mines and source for Gold in the late 1970s went on strike in South Africa. Important to note that gold ownership by citizens had been restricted or outlawed by the government until the mid 1970s. This means the rise in gold was in part due to the US government leagalization of gold ownership in the 1970s. Mr. Volker was indeed lucky to be in the right place at the right time to receive credit for the Gold and Silver commodity bubble burst. The true market value of Gold at the 1980 peak was about $80-125.00 based on the government deficit figures. The government deficit caught up and surpassed gold in the late 1990s. Except for extreme events or supply disruption that occurred during the late 1970s, add about $100 to the price of Gold for every 1 trillion dollars added to the government deficit based on the governments current high credit rating. As stated in another post above, the Hunt Brothers helped Silver rise to about $50.00 before it collapsed.

I don't consider myself a "deflationist", nor am I sure what it means, but I'll try answering the question "How can a nation escape a deflationary spiral?"
If a nation has little or no debt, then it is much easier to end deflation, but in that case it is unlikely that such a nation would ever fall into the deflationary pit. The nation could borrow and use that to pay down private debt.
If a nation owns some particular natural resource (gold, oil, timber, etc), then that wealth could be used to pay down private debt.
War may be the most common endgame for those nations that can actually pull off a "win" of such war. War works because the government can successfully pull-off things like wage-price freezes, rationing, ceasing private wealth/property, restricting flow of money, and dozens of other things that seem anathema to today's citizenry.
-Dave
My take away; get out of I bonds. Thanks!
You can't think of any other outcome to credit collapse than hyper-inflation? Was the outcome of the Great Depression a hyperinflation in Amerika?
Hyperinflation is the anomaly rather than the norm. Generally in deflationary depressions goods simply disappear from the marketplace as the money supply disappears.
Anyhow, hyperinflation may occur once Da Goobermint starts passing out free money to J6P as they do for the banksters, but until then if prices go up to the moon, people will simply stop buying, necessity or not. They don't have the MONEY. That is the simple truth.
RE
Hyperinflation is economically defined as a minimum monthly inflation rate of 50%. In the world's greatest hyperinflationary event - post-WWII Hungary - prices doubled every 13 1/2 hours. Even the recent Zimbabwean hyperinflation 'only' experienced price doubling every five days. Hyperinflation is not a relative thing. It either is, or it isn't. Using the strictest of definitions, 1979 was no more hyperinflationary than was 1937. That said, there's no reason to believe that hyperinflation will by-pass the U.S. under current monetary and socio-political conditions.
Thank you so much for these recent articles, they have given me great insight into things I have come to only recently.
In response to RE, during the Great Depression the U.S. dollar was a gold backed currency. Today, it is a pure fiat currency, meaning that it requires the public's faith in order to have any value. That's why we didn't have hyperinflation then.
Hyperinflation will happen here because it's impossible for the government to pay off its debts. This is not widely recognized yet. Once it is recognized, the flight out of bonds will begin, and that money will go straight into commodities. Deflationists believe this money will go straight into the U.S. dollar, which makes absolutely no sense to me. And quite frankly, I don't see how anyone who follows the economy, and the philosophy of the Federal Reserve Bank, could possibly believe such a thing. After all, bonds are just promises to pay dollars. The Fed is not going to default on its debt. No way in hell. They will print.
You explain hyperinflation better than anyone else I've read, and I've read a lot of people's work on the subject. Excellent!
The US dollar may be the beneficiary of large capital flow. Most debt in the US and on other balance sheets is denominated in US dollars. This moutain of debt could act as a huge synthetic short against certain tangible items leading to a rush to dollars to service public and private debt. The massive wave of US dollar creation may be partly a final step to dollarize the world or leave the world few alternatives due to US dollar related debt.
Gonzalo, I hope you read the comments on your blog. I'm posting this comment instead of sending you an email.
I've read your posts the past few weeks about hyperinflation, the treasury bubble, and now stagflation, and I think you are dead on target. I agree with everything you have said -- except your assessment of Glenn Beck. :) Ironically, I think you and he would agree with each other on many, if not most, things.
Having lived also in S America during highly inflationary times, having seen the consequences of both military and socialist governments, and knowing the resulting civil unrest, I share many of your perspectives.
I am beginning to wonder if we are now seeing the early stages of commodity hyperinflation.
I am a commodities trader, and despite that with every tick higher I make money, I am genuinely alarmed that commodities are back in bubble territory very much like 2008 again. Just look at the weekly charts for corn, soybeans, sugar, coffee, and cotton. They are going parabolic!
I expect each day to see these commodity bubbles collapse and prices crash back to earth, but each day, they move higher and higher. Instead of prices reaching a zenith and tumbling back to earth, they are ACCELERATING higher, not lower! Other commodities, especially agricultural commodities, are rocketing higher almost every day. So are commodities not traded in the futures exchanges. Even commodities that were trending downward (lumber, cocoa, natural gas) have now reversed and are trending higher again.
I don't know of any commodity futures that are trending lower except for crude oil, which is only down 3 days. Corn, sugar, cotton, coffee, orange juice, soybeans, soybean oil, soybean meal, live cattle, milk, lean hog, oats, gold, silver, palladium, platinum, copper, and rice are all trending higher. Many are rising at parabolic rates. Just look at the charts! Why not post those weekly charts here? They would help to make your case!
I find it hard to believe that ALL these commodities are all facing strong demand with limited supplies simultaneously. I can't help but wonder if some of the QE money being funneled through the primary dealers is also finding its way into commodities. This is likely to accelerate even faster when the bond/treasury bubble(s) pops. It makes me very nervous to see where this is headed.
When I read your articles a few weeks ago on ZH and here, something clicked in my head and I had an "aha" moment. I think you are absolutely correct and with the very rapid rise in commodity prices over these past few months, I am beginning to wonder if we're seeing it in its early stages right now.
I also remember reading some months back an article suggesting that we could see hyperinflation in some assets while we are simultaneously seeing debt-based deflation of other assets (eg., real estate) and paper assets (bonds, stocks). Sound familiar? Commodity inflation (bad enough) or hyperinflation (much worse), the author suggested, would kill pricing power of businesses, thus plunging many into insolvency, while consequently leading to even higher unemployment. (By the way, the effect on employment would be a subject that I would like to know more about in the Allende government. What was the impact of hyperinflation on unemployment?)
Keep up the insightful writing! Thanks for having the courage to share it with the rest of us!
Hasta entonces, amigo!
To RE.... Why the hell does the price of gold keep going up if people have no money? Food aint gotten any cheaper either... Lol
who the hell is this Anon who states the price of gold went up in 1971 because the Feds allowed gold ownership again... That has to be the single stupidest thing I ever read. Hello! The price of gold went up because we went to a fiat currency and Nixon turned down France's request to turn in their dollars for gold. We renigged on the Bretton Woods agreement! Ya think... Maybe... Just maybe that had a bit to do with it? Wow!
S Benard said it...commodities are already going up and have been since May or June of this year. Meanwhile the long end of the curve is beginning to steepen with the /ZB futures down 3 of the last 4 weeks.
food for thought.
@Neil
That the Fed will continue to print, of this I have no doubt. They have been doing it for well onto 2 years now, with no hyperinflation. What the Fed will NOT do is distribute free money to anyone but the PDs, who will not hand out the money to anybody else. So unless and until Da Goobermint pulls a China and FORCES the banks to lend and FORCES biznesses to take the loans, the notional currency simply never goes into circulation. When one of these factors changes you can get your hyperinflation, but at the moment its not politically possible to do that here inthe FSofA.
Anyhow, I wrote a longer explanation of this over on Reverse Engineering. The article is too long to fit in this response field.
RE
Very good article, Thanks. My comment is that faith in the dollar and thus price of commodity could rise very quickly instead of gradually
1. at that time the Feb kept rasing interest rate to chase after inflation rate. Today it's likely the Feb will keep it low even if CPI starts to go up
2. at that time dollar = oil. Today countires starts to sell their oil in other currencies.
3. Today we have China
Having lived through that period running a family petroleum distributor biz (and saddled with an MBA), there is a need for clarification on what was what back then. Note the following differences:
1. When people saw that they could get a 2 year CD at 18%, they believed like he** in the $. This is the MOST important point. Wouldn't you like that now from a stable bank?
2. The US had a manufacturing base. In NC/SC, most county seats had their traffic jams at 3:30 when the 1st shift got off.
3. Moral Malaise Carter got run out of town by Reagan.
4. Remember that price controls existed on oil and gasoline. Reagan dumped them and gasoline/ heating oil doubled in price in a year, going from 60 cents to $1.20.
4. Derivatives? We don't need no stinking derivatives. Yes, there was some CBOE hedging. How gauche and unsophisticated.
5. The mainstream press was nothing like what it is now. They WANT us to suffer now.
6. FICA was 1% when JC got elected - Democrat legislation in the late 70s ramped it to the 15.3% level.
7. There were local businesses and full service gas stations. Now we have WalMart and pump your own, bitchez.
8. Prez Ford actually had red/white buttons printed saying "WIN" - Whip Inflation Now". It was around 5% then. The Man From Plains got it to 15% or so.
Ho hum. The bottom line was that no one felt that the US was going down the tubes.
Well, just my thoughts, I don't think the commodity prices have been rising during the last several months from people slowly and surely running from dollar, but mostly from equity linked trades(stocks are to go up, they also trade to bet commodity go up) or actual belivers of V shaped economy.
I believe the event in Iran back in 1979 was a surprise to everyone, it was really a shock. On the other hand, US treasury, Fed, and banks throwing around US debt is not a secret and it has been going around for many months. Even governments around the world are worried about defending dollar. I am afraid that once we see the possibility of an auction failure, the run will be a sudden and large one. And I wonder whether everyone will run to commodities. There are good currencies out there with a lot of trade vol, these just have to be "safer" than the previously so called safest US assets. NZ, AU, NOK, and a few others might qualify, even Yen.
Ag commodities continue to go parabolic Sunday evening.
I remembered whose article I read about some assets were inflating while others were deflating. It was Gordon Long, who also has posted to ZH. You guys on on the same page!
...and from what I'm seeing of real estate and ag commodities, the markets are too!
CFTC COT report from Friday indicates that USD shorts are increasing their bets. No small wonder!

I have a question: is there a measure people can look at to see how many dollars have been created by the Federal Reserve? Would that be MB, as explained on Wikipedia?
It seems to me that the effects of fractional-reserve banking should not affect our faith in the value of a dollar, so measures of the money supply that include those effects (M2 among others) don't tell us whether the dollar is being debased or not.
I understand that a panic can occur based on a widely-held belief that the Fed will debase the currency in the future, even if the Fed hasn't actually done so at all yet, but I'd like to be able to watch what the Fed actually does, if that's possible.
Karen,
The Fed has been sneaky about debasing the dollar—I'll have a post in a couple of days. Meanwhile, the best way to figure out how the Fed is debasing the dollar is to look at its balance sheet.
In the "Termite-Riddled House" post, I linked to a very good interactive graph the shows the composition of the Fed's balance sheet through time.
Hope this helps. Specific questions, do feel free to e-mail me.

It should be noted that inflation was a windfall to homeowners in the 1970's as the value of their homes soared and the dollar value of their mortgages remained unchanged. Business who invested in capital goods to grow businesses in this period also benefited. We have been brainwashed to believe that inflation is a wholly negative phenomenon,rather than a phenomenon that has winners and losers. Volker's fight against inflation help set the stage for the debt laden strait jacket the US and the rest of the world is now facing. The fight against inflation was won at the cost of high unemployment which undermined the bargaining power of labour to demand fair wages. The nail in the coffin of inflation was augmented by the outsourcing of american jobs and the importation of cheap foreign goods.
The engine of growth for the American and world economies for the past several years has been debt, both private and public. This debt will only be repaid if economies create jobs to repay this debt. Inflation ensures that those holding cash put the money to work either by buying assets or investing in businesses.
trishflanagan -
I think it is impossible to say that true hyperinflation is anything but awful. It leads very quickly to a barter economy, and one in which some people (farmers) can do OK but others (government employees) have to come to the black market with nothing but their (nearly worthless) stuff to trade.
I read a book about inflation (The Economics of High Inflation, by Paul Beckerman, 1992) that did a bad job of explaining its causes but a good job explaining why it is bad. Mr. Beckerman certainly convinced me. His points:
(1) People avoid holding money. Many buy hard assets like gold, silver, foreign currencies, and artworks. That money is totally nonproductive. Others buy stocks, which is not as bad, but when people do this they spend a lot more time juggling their accounts and investments, because they have to buy and sell stocks all the time to pay the bills. They also experience a lot more anxiety, especially if stock prices are volatile.
(2) High inflation tends to be unpredictable. The higher the average value, the higher is the variability. That leads to difficulty in planning, which leads to avoidance of long-term loans, which makes financing big projects very difficult. Big projects are therefore postponed or abandoned, which shrinks economic activity.
(3) High inflation affects different goods and services differently, distorting relative prices and leading to the misallocation of resources. So lenders and borrowers cannot escape uncertainty by agreeing to "real value" inflation-adjusted repayment terms, because if the borrowing business doesn't have enough pricing power it won't be able to repay the loan.
(4) High inflation increases conflict and reduces trust, damaging social cohesion. Loans tend to end up being unfair in one direction or the other, causing resentment in the loser. Different interest groups (business, labor) also try to protect themselves by lobbying government for special treatment, which when granted always hurts the other parties.
Sorry for the long post!
GL - Thanks, I'll look forward to that post!
I hope you will clarify whether everything is reflected in that balance sheet, including currency. If so, that seems kind of scary.
Reverse Engineer's Deflation all the way is nonsense.
If Americans won't have the cash to buy things which are dirt cheap in the stores you think the Chinese will not either?
Neil:"In response to RE, during the Great Depression the U.S. dollar was a gold backed currency.":
Uhh, no it wasn't, after 1933, when FDR took the US off the gold standard.
It's the end of 2012, and it isn't happening. I don't doubt the fact that hyperinflation is likely, but it seems like the status quo can be maintained for a long time.
Kicking the can down the road seems to be the policy of the government for now..

Because Reading Is Magic: Take a Child to a Bookstore on Dec. 1st
In 2010 I brought my two young children ran—a more avid group of readers you couldn't hope to find. When I floated the idea for Take Your Child to a Bookstore Day, bloggers on the listserv spread the word. My husband designed a poster, a website, and bookmarks, and we marked the first Saturday in December on our calendars.. The goal was to raise awareness that kids + bookstores = magic.
And maybe something critical to building strong citizens as well as strong readers.
You know that old ad campaign, "Orange juice isn’t just for breakfast anymore?" I hear that now as, "Bookstores aren’t just for reading anymore."
They're more than that because you can also buy toys, cards, gifts, or have your butterscotch latte there. Bookstores are places where people can come together over ideas and engage in a cultural conversation. That concept is so important I have to say it again. They are places where people come together. Booksellers are a group who know how to zig while others are zagging, so impassioned are they by their life's pursuit, and 1, 2012 is the third annual Take Your Child to a Bookstore Day. Whether you take your own child—or that of someone else in your life—together let's build literacy, support community, and make magic happen.

Kym Gail Ryder (née Marsh) (born in Whiston, Knowsley, Merseyside, England, on 13 June 1976) is an English Actress and Singer. Marsh grew up in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Greater Manchester. Ryder first arose to fame when the reality TV show Popstars emerged. She is presently most recognisable from her role as Michelle Connor on the long-running ITV soap opera Coronation Street which she has played since 2006.
In 2001 ITV's talent show Popstars was on the lookout for five girls, or boys, to be part of a group, that would go on to try and make it big in the charts. Kym was one of the lucky one's who impressed judges with her vocal talent.
After becoming one of the chosen five for the group now called Hear'Say, she and fellow group mates were moved into a mansion, in preparation for the single and album launch. Whilst auditioning for the group, she kept it a secret that she had two children, David and Emily, who were then aged 5 and 3. She became particularly noticeable when she became angry and emotional when one judge, Nigel Lythgoe, advised her to lose weight. Cursing and crying, Marsh refused to be judged, but became popular with the public.
Hear'Say hit the #1 spot with debut single Pure & Simple and also with their debut album Popstars. 37 date sell-out arena tour and performed numerous television guest appearances.
However, the media were quick to savage the group, and scrutinise their every move. The band enjoyed one more single before tensions started to emerge.
In July of 2003 Kym released her debut solo album which contained her three solo singles and twelve other tracks.
Kym's 'make-or-break' 3rd single, Sentimental, stalled at #35 resulting in her being dropped by her record label. Kym has since expressed her unhappiness whilst she was in the music industry.
In a surprise move in early 2006, she entered Making Your Mind Up, the UK show to pick a singer and song for the Eurovision Song Contest with a song called "Whisper To Me". Kym came fourth in the contest, losing out to the winner Daz Sampson.
From July 2004 to February 2005, Marsh played "Annette" in the hit West End musical Saturday Night Fever at the Apollo Victoria Theatre to much critical acclaim, The Guardian calling her 'sparkling'. In November 2005, Ryder re-joined the musical during it's UK tour with a short run of performances at the Edinburgh Playhouse.
Awards WON 'Best Newcomer' (Michelle Connor, Coronation St) at the September 2007 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards 2007. 'Best Newcomer' (Michelle Connor, Coronation St) at the May 2007 British Soap Awards. 'Most Popular Newcomer' (Michelle Connor, Coronation St) at the 2007 2nd TVNow Awards.
Kym is also nominated for the 'Best Newcomer' award at the National Television Awards to be screened on ITV1 on the 31st of October 2007.
After settling in St Albans with husband Jack Ryder, the couple had early difficulties and a split for a short while. In light of her regular roles in north-west-produced dramas, while Jack generally tours in theatre, the couple moved to Manchester and closer to Kym's family in 2005.

6. Increased penalties for attacking and/or injuring Auxiliary Police Officers.
By granting Auxiliary Officers the status of PEACE OFFICER WHILE ON DUTY, Auxiliary
Members will be re-qualified as "NYC SPECIAL PATROLMEN." a status that exists
in the NYC Administrative Code and the NYS Criminal Procedure Law. The change
in status will automatically bring with it an increased range of penalties
for injury to an Auxiliary Officer.
7. Appropriate benefits for disabled Auxiliary Officers and their families.
8. Mandated regular reporting by NYPD to City Council on Auxiliary Program statistics such as equipment, vehicles, training, hours, and number of personnel.
9. Improved and increased training and self defense classes for Auxiliary Officers to be administered by Police Academy Instructors.

MEMPHIS - -
Senior forward Nicole Dickson was named the Conference USA Player of the Week and freshman guard Ariel Hearn was named C-USA Freshman of the Week Monday.
Dickson scored 28 points in the Tigers' win over Missouri on Saturday, her sixth 20-plus point effort in the first 12 games of the season. Dickson opened the game with a three-point field goal and never looked back, shooting 56.3 percent from the field and knocking down a total of four three-point field goals to improve to sixth in school history in career threes. With the scored tied at 69 with less than 30 seconds to play, Dickson got the ball and knocked down a six-foot jumper with 0.4 seconds left on the clock to break the tie and put Memphis up 71-69. She knocked down the and-one for the old-fashioned three-point play to give the Tigers the final 72-69 edge on the scoreboard.
This is her second C-USA weekly honor this season and the second of her career.
Hearn earned her first career weekly honor from C-USA after scoring 17 points, including 12 in the second half, in the win over Missouri. Three times, Missouri hit a bucket, including two threes, to cut into Memphis' lead in the waning minutes of the second half on Saturday. Each time, Hearn answered on the Memphis end of the floor, knocking down a layup and converting the jumper and one to help Memphis hang on to the lead. She finished with four assists and was the team's second-leading rebounder with six boards in the win.
The win over Missouri was Memphis' first win over an SEC school since 2003 and snapped a 13-game losing streak to SEC opponents for the Tigers.
Memphis is hosting Tennessee Tech beginning at 12:05 p.m. in the Elma Roane Fieldhouse on Monday. Memphis wraps up non-conference play Saturday with a 1 p.m. contest against Wright State in the Fieldhouse.

Verizon quietly confirmed that it will be releasing a BlackBerry 10 smartphone when RIM’s new mobile operating system launches in the early part of 2013.
The carrier confirmed the news to CNET yesterday in addition to confirming plans to release multiple Windows Phone 8 powered smartphones in the fourth quarter of this year.
Verizon Chief Marketing Officer Tami Erwin stated that the carrier will be carrying a BlackBerry 10 device at launch though Erwin remained silent about what device it would offer, if it would offer multiple devices or when the launch might take place.
Read: RIM to Debut 6 New BlackBerry Devices With BlackBerry 10 in Early 2013.
Thus far, all RIM has said is that the software will launch in Q1 of next year. Originally, the software was going to debut this year but RIM delayed the launch beyond this year’s holiday season.
The company is said to be releasing a grand total of six BlackBerry 10 devices to go along with the launch in Q1 2013 though the company remains mum on the specifics of those devices. We do have bits and pieces of information though.
We know that one will be a touchscreen-only slate-style device with an HD display clocking in with 1280 X 720 pixels. And we know that another will come with a candybar form factor, full QWERTY hardware keyboard, and a 720 X 720 display.
The other four BlackBerry 10 devices remain in the shadows at this point. We expect the two aforementioned devices to be the flagship devices though, meaning they will get the most promotion and likely, the most sales.
Read: Early Review of QWERTY BlackBerry 10 Device is Positive.
It’s unclear what other carriers, if any, will be on board when BlackBerry 10 devices do arrive.
The new software represents a major overhaul for the BlackBerry operating system, the current generation of which is Blackberry 7. BlackBerry 10 will feature a new UI, improved virtual keyboard, a new Music player and a whole lot more.
RIM also says that BlackBerry 10 will have a thriving app marketplace at launch and it expects to launch with more applications than any first-generation operating system.
It has not said how many apps it plans to have available at launch.

Energy Projects
The Isle of Man, and Isle of Man Government use a lot of energy every year. Within Government, we are committed to improving our energy efficiency and reducing our overall energy use To assist in this the Energy Initiatives Capital Fund was established in Budget 2008 with £3m. This Fund is to finance spend-to-save energy projects if Departments aren’t able to finance these projects themselves. The Fund has also been used for other energy and sustainability projects, such as the Renewable Energy Study from AEA which you can download below. The AEA report reviewed which Renewable Energy technologies may be most suitable for the Isle of Man, how much energy they could supply and at what cost.
A selection of already implemented projects can also be found below.
The AEA Report confirmed that the first priority is always energy efficiency. Biomass (woodchip) was highlighted as a very attractive option for the Isle of Man to supply renewable heat.
The graph on the right shows the relative prices of Isle of Man fuels, as at April 2011. Wood Heating is a very cost-effective source of energy. The first building to install a wood chip boiler was DEFA HQ in St Johns. Future buildings suitable for wood chip boilers include Sheltered Housing schemes, swimming pools, large schools and offices. Heat from wood fuel, burned in special biomass boilers, is environmentally friendly and carbon neutral because the plantations are managed and replanted, so there are always more trees to replace those harvested.

I've heard that the coyotes found here are as big as wolves, or a German shepherd?
The average Eastern coyote in Nova Scotia is about 15 kg (34 lbs) with some males reaching 23 kg (50 lbs.). This is about twice the size of coyotes found in southwestern USA. This larger size has been attributed to past interbreeding with wolves, as coyotes spread northward and eastward across the continent. Today, the coyotes found here are considerably smaller than wolves. In terms of dogs, they're about the size of a border collie or approximately 61 cm (24 in.) at the shoulder. See visually the size of coyotes.
Weren't coyotes brought into Nova Scotia by people?
No. Their arrival here was part of a natural range expansion that began in the southwestern United States in the late 1800's due to pressures on their traditional habitat caused by land clearing and development. The first coyotes in Maritimes travelled here from Ontario, Quebec, New England. They eventually reached Cape Breton by crossing the ice-covered Canso Strait.
Are there wolf/coyote crossbreeds in Nova Scotia?
It is highly unlikely. It appears that interbreeding with wolves was in the past and that the Eastern coyote is now genetically distinct.
What about coyote/dog crosses, or coydogs?
There were reports of coyote/dog crosses during the initial stages of range expansion across the continent. Today the likelihood of successful coyote/dog crosses is remote. As young would be born mid-winter, their likelihood of survival would be low, and unlike wild dogs, male domestic dogs do not help provide food for the young.
How can I tell if what I'm seeing is a coyote. See visually the size of coyotes.
Is it more common to see coyotes during.
Don't coyotes hunt in large packs?
Coyotes may hunt alone, in pairs, or family units. Family units often occur in the fall or early winter as an adult pair teaches their young to hunt.
Is it true that female coyotes can have super-sized litters to compensate for population losses due to hunting and trapping?
In Nova Scotia the average litter is five to seven pups. Our records show a low of two, and a high of ten, pups per litter. If the coyote population goes down there will be less competition for food and as a result females will be in better condition and the litter survival rate may increase, but there is no evidence that a female can somehow control the size of her litters.
Why is the population of coyotes in Nova Scotia increasing?
The population of coyotes in the province is actually fairly stable. There are slight variations often dependent on the amount of trapping activity as well as availability of traditional food sources.
Why are coyotes also found in urban areas? Have we invaded their home?
As coyotes are a relatively new species to Nova Scotia, we have not invaded their traditional home. Coyotes are very adaptable opportunists and will live in and near human settlements, and take advantage of any food sources found there. Does the provincial government trap nuisance coyotes when people lose pets? No, but your local Department of Natural Resources office can provide a list of nuisance wildlife operators who are available for hire to capture animals that come into conflict with humans. Why do we have a pelt-incentive program instead of a bounty? The pelt-incentive program was put in place to increase trapper participation and thus have more coyotes harvested. Increased trapping can also affect coyote behaviour causing animals to fear and avoid humans. This is different from a bounty, which is a broad-scale price put on the target species to promote killing by anyone at anytime.
Isn't there some way to get rid of coyotes once and for all?
No. The Eastern coyote is a permanent year-round resident in Nova Scotia. Even a full scale bounty would have only a temporary effect on reducing coyote numbers. The best measure we can take is to Keep Coyotes Wild by not willingly or inadvertently providing food sources for them. This will help preserve their normal behaviour of avoiding people and places of human settlement.

Show me the cuts! That's the message coming from 50 pro-clean energy House Democrats, who are growing concerned over the lack of details on possible sequestration cuts to energy and environment programs.
My colleague Amy Harder reports for National Journal Daily on the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, chaired by Reps. Steve Israel and Gerry Connolly.
From Harder's story:
For example, it's assumed that some national parks would be closed, but the Obama administration is not being specific about which ones.
"The lack of specifics is troubling: We don't know what this will mean for our ability to provide clean drinking water, protect people from hazardous air pollutants, and continue creating good-paying American jobs in the renewable-energy industry," said Kara Allen, executive director of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition...
"SEEC members are ready to work with members on both sides of the aisle to find a solution to these indiscriminate across-the-board cuts," Allen added.
But the White House isn't budging. The administration isn't doling out any more details than what's already in a lengthy Office of Management and Budget report.
While that document does have dollars and percentages on broad cuts to programs, it doesn't really lay out what specific things will be cut from programs. And when you're dealing with a budget of, say, $2.2 billion, like that of the National Park Service, a 8.2 percent cut could get implemented in lots of different ways.

ALUMNUS RECOGNIZED FOR WORK IN EXCAVATION
Grace alumnus Ben Thomas (BA 02, MA 05), who is currently a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, was a square supervisor for an Oriental Institute dig in Zincirli, Turkey. They excavated a well-preserved eighth century B.C. funerary stele for an official named Kuttamuwa. Archaeology magazine selected it as one of the top 10 discoveries of 2008. For a picture of the stele and Ben reading it, see. Ben reports that he was called on to read the inscription (it’s in an old western Aramaic dialect in the Phoenician script). His success in translating it received public recognition from Professor Dennis Pardee and the dig director, Professor David Schloen.
Ben has published an article in ZAW 120 (2008) and has two articles awaiting publication (in Hebrew Studies and BASOR). He’s also a contributor to a forthcoming encyclopedia and a volume entitled, Popular Controversies in World History. In addition he’s been presenting papers at SBL and AOS meetings. Ben is ABD and is working on his dissertation proposal: “Prophetic Historiography in the Books of Kings.”

In december 2011 I received a call from a tele-caller who introduced himself as calling on behalf of bag-it-today. I was offered a 7 nights/8 days holiday at luxury hotels/Resorts all across the globe. I told him that I would only be interested in resorts in and around delhi. He then went on to give me some website addresses around delhi/Rajasthan and asked me to see for myself the kind of resorts that would be available to me if I bought this package. The sites were some lovely resorts nearby delhi which anyone would like to visit. I said what is the assurance that I would definitely get bookings at these resorts? he told me I would need to book 0-45 days in advance and I would 'definitely get my choice of resort'. He also made me speak to his superior who told me I would definitely get an assured booking, in one of the resorts, if I booked as per the procedure of booking 0-45 days in advance. On these assurances the transaction was completed as per the following details: item code: a1671 - affordable holidays-7 nights 8 days amount: rs.7000 invoice no.Trnpl/DLI/2011-2012/410569 order no. 2078 invoice date: 31/12/2011 order date: 31/12/2011 the points where I have been misled /Cheated are: 1. The resorts / Sites that were shown to me before booking are not there on the list of resorts available for booking. These were the resorts I wanted to visit. How can you show me one thing and then not have it on your list? this is definitely misleading/Cheating. 2. It was said that 0-45 days advance notice would be required and you will 'definitely' get one of the two resorts you opt for. On making inquiries I am told that the resorts availability depends on the resorts being up for promotion at the time when we want to visit. You can only opt for the resorts that are up for promotion at that time. What happens to the resorts you want to visit/Wanted to visit/Or were shown as being on the list when you booked? this means that they can just show few resorts as being up for promotion at any given time and you 'take-it or leave-it'. What I booked for is not on the list, and even if it is on the list it will not be up for promotion, so we are back to square one - take seven nights at a shady resort that they offer or just forget it! this is cheating/Misleading of the highest order. I request a complete refund, immediately, with interest, and an apology from the company for the mental agony and financial loss caused by such wrong/Fraudulent dealings by the company. If the company fails to take action then I request grahak seva to help me file a case in a consumer forum to teach these cheats a lesson. Thanks for the great help to consumers like me by grahak seva. Atul sharma

Faulty parallelism
Can anyone help me understand what is wrong with this sentence and how I can make it any clearer?
See example:
As an Industrial Designer I look forward to not only solving functionality problems but also challenging and stretching the limits of my creativity, and as a poet and writer, I anticipate creating comprehendible beauty in the things I write and fully expressing and sharing the things most important to me.
1 answer
I don't think there are any 'faulty parallelism' errors in your sentence. All of your clauses contain gerunds so there are no problems there which relate to 'faulty paralellism'.
However, this sentence is quite long, and, first of all, it would be more effective if it were broken down into two sentences, as follows:
As an Industrial Designer, I look forward to not only solving functionality problems but also challenging and stretching the limits of my creativity. What's more, as a poet and writer, I anticipate creating comprehensible beauty in the things I write and fully expressing and sharing the things that are most important to me.
But there is more for you to think about. 'Functionality' is a horrible word. I am not at all familiar with the 'industrial design' field, but if you are also a poet/writer, you should be able to come up with a less jargony word for that.
Comprehendible is an actual word in the dictionary, I found out, but comprehensible is much more common. Neither word particularly lends much to your sales pitch, or whatever it is. It might be a good idea to get rid of it.
'Anticipate' may not be quite the exact verb you want, either. It simply means 'expect' (which is not the same as 'look forward to'), and I think you need a stronger, more desirous verb to express yourself. How about something like this:
What's more, as a poet and writer, I strive to express the world's beauty, and connect my everyday concerns to the universal.
You seem to be melding two quite different identities into one thought/marketing statement/sales pitch, and if that is your project, more power to you! Without any other context, I can't quite understand how 'industrial design' matches up with 'poetry and writing' so I am not sure what this text is trying to achieve, or who you want to appeal to. And the part where you said you are interested in challenging and stretching the limits of [your] creativity doesn't sound particularly related to industrial design, which your text links it to, but seems more connected to writing, including specifically writing poetry.
I hope my comments are of some help. Good luck!
Shawn
Shawn thank you so much! The sentence is part of a college application supplemental essay for a dual degree program that wants to know how I intend to meld my passion for the two. If you were to see the sentence in context it would probably make more sense. Thank you so much for your feedback! I hope it will be ok using some part of your corrected sentences in my revision :)add comment

ONLINE EXTRA: Treumann Lykken's war: Rural Adams, N.D., native's service in 164th launched lifetime of vet involvement (Aug. 12, 2007)From Herald archives, 2007.
"I was on a weekend pass down in Beaumont, Texas" in December of that year, recalled Lykken, 21 then, now 87 and a Grand Forks resident. "Four, five of us got in a car and drove down there, just for the weekend. Just looking the sights over down on the beach there.
"Well, we come to the gas station, we were going to gas up for the trip back home (to Camp Claiborne), and the guy says, `Are you ready? ' And we said, `Ready for what? '
That's when they learned about the Japanese attack on Hawaii's Pearl Harbor.
"So, we said, `Well, we better head back to camp.'"
Lykken was among the first troops sent to the Pacific Northwest - the nation's, not the ocean's. His squad was assigned to guard a railroad bridge at American Falls, Idaho. "We slept in a boxcar right outside the bridge and ate uptown at the cafe."
They ultimately were sent by ship to Australia, then New Caledonia, both in the South Pacific, in 1942.
By the time the rural Adams, N.D., native's Pacific Theatre tour of duty was over, it was latter 1945, and World War II had just ended.
Lucky and unlucky
Recuperated from a bout with jaundice that late summer, Lykken was aboard a ship bound for the States that had stopped at Hawaii for repairs when word came that the Japanese had surrendered.
"I was one of the last (discharged)," a chuckling Lykken said. "I guess I wasn't lucky.
"You took it a day at a time. Not much you could do about it. ... I was happy to serve, of course. There were ups and downs, but I come through it hale and hardy."
Not completely. After dodging malaria throughout his island-hopping combat service in the Pacific, Lykken says, he was stricken at home by the infectious tropical and sub-tropical disease around Thanksgiving and Christmas.
But return home, he did.
Not all members of the 164th - which, at the battle of Guadalcanal, became the first U.S. Army unit to take the combat offensive in World War II - were as fortunate, Lykken knows all too well.
The records show that the war killed 325 members of the 164th and wounded nearly 1,200 more.
"We were lucky to get through it alive," said Lykken, assigned to 60-millimeter mortars during the war. "We're grateful."
Active veteran
He's come a long way from the high school kid who went with several friends in the late 1930s to sign up with the National Guard's Grafton, N.D.-based C Company. Then, he was paying little attention to the uneasiness in Europe involving Germany's rising Nazi Party.
"Really, I just wanted to get into the service. Hope I'd pass the physical and so on," he recalled, laughing softly.
Post-war, Lykken quickly left farming when North Dakota dirt and dust gave him frequent nosebleeds. He worked eight years in retail sales for Gamble stores in Grafton, Carrington and Bismarck, and in Webster, S.D. Shortly after moving the family to Grand Forks in 1954, he began a 28-year career at Sears, retiring in 1982.
But he didn't abandon his military ties. Back in '45, Lykken and an older brother, Harvey, an Air Force mechanic in the war's European Theatre, quickly joined the American Legion post in Adams. "I guess most guys were joining veterans organizations at the time," Treumann said.
He became an active, involved member, serving twice as a post commander, at Carrington and Grand Forks; and once as state commander, in 1975-76. He also spent three terms of three years each on the Legion's National Americanism Commission.
A den in his home contains memorabilia from 60-plus years of service in the Legion and other veterans organizations.
He lives alone now.
His wife of 56 years, the former Margaret Lothspeich of Langdon, N.D., died in May 2002. She spent most of the war years in Washington as a secretary for the offices of the War Production Board, which oversaw the wartime rationing of fuel, rubber and other materials. They married in 1946. Three of their five children - Diane Kraemer, Warren Lykken and Debra Muus - live in Grand Forks.
Treumann Lykken's life may be far removed from his first combat experience in 1942. But he hasn't forgotten Guadalcanal.
Restless nights
From Australia, the 164th were sent to join other troops to form the Americal Division at New Caledonia. Then, they were sent by small boats to Guadalcanal to help Marines defend Henderson Field, a vital airstrip to the war effort, from Japanese naval and infantry attacks.
Reaching Guadalcanal in October 1942, Lykken and other 164th soldiers saw beach debris and other evidence of shelling. "We got our first casualty while unloading," he recalled. "He was killed by a sniper."
On Guadalcanal, the soldiers quickly tried to find places to dig a sufficiently deep fox holes amid the shale and rock. The landscape "was infested with roaches and other insects, you know. They'd chirp at night. Pitch black. You couldn't see your hand in front of your face. Any movement, you'd think it was (Japanese soldiers)."
For several days, "we were really bombed from land, sea and air. I don't know, but a lot of people said we really could have been pushed back into the ocean very easily. But we held on. ... We almost lost (Henderson Field) many of times. It was bombed and strafed, of course, and we had very few aircraft left at one point."
The 164th's C Company was several miles from the field, and some other companies took higher casualties. In the Battle for Henderson Field, the 164th saw 26 of its own killed and double that number injured.
"I know I spent 30 days in the foxhole without getting a bath or a darned thing," Lykken recalled. "Thirty days on the line, (under fire) anytime, all the time," with only C-rations - prepared canned food - for meals. "I spent a lot of restless nights there."
Deadly individual battles and patrols replaced the fierce fighting of those first weeks. The 164th saw nearly 150 of its soldiers killed by the time it left the island in early 1943.
Closest call
From Guadalcanal, Lykken and others got some rest, relaxation and more training on the Fiji Islands before being sent in late 1943 to Bougainville, part of the Solomon Islands.
The 164th stayed there for most of 1944, going out on patrols, checking for signs of Japanese combatants.
At Bougainville, Lykken says, he came closest to losing his life.
"We were advancing on a ridge. There happened to be a ridge to our right, and it was higher up than we were, actually. The Japanese had a pill box there, and we got strafed by machine gun fire, you know. So, we got off of that hill as fast as we could, of course, on our stomachs.
"That's where my gunner was hurt, and I think the lieutenant up ahead of me there, he was hurt. ... The shells were peppering all right around me, and it took the front sight off my rifle. ... It scared me."
Shock of loss
Combat training helped save his life, but it couldn't prepare him for a different loss that occurred while at Bougainville.
An Army chaplain found Lykken at his position in the Solomon Island hills one day and delivered a letter with news from home.
"I lost my mother when I was in Bougainville," he recalled somberly. Ragna Lykken had not been sick. "Not really," he said. "She died in the Langdon hospital. That's where they went. She had a blood problem of some kind. ... She wasn't very old. 47, 48. Maybe a little older than that.
"Never expecting anything at all, you know, that was wrong with her," Lykken recalled, his voice softening. "So, it was shocking."
That news from home, he says, remains one of his most distinct war memories.
A year later, back in the States, Lykken was discharged at Fort Lewis, Wash., and he took a long bus ride across the Rocky Mountains and Northern Plains to Grafton. His sister Beulah picked him up at Grafton and brought him back to the farm home north of Adams.
Once there, one of the very first things Treumann Lykken did was to visit the gravesite of Ragna Lykken.

ANN BAILEY: Are we raising a generation of nincompoops.
After reading a story a few weeks ago that questioned whether we are raising a generation of nincompoops, I decided to check out the definition of the word and find out where it originated. I had a general idea of the meaning, but wanted to get the official word on it.
According to the Merriam Webster online dictionary, nincompoop means fool or simpleton and synonyms include ding-bat, ding-dong and doofus. The first known use of nincompoop was in 1676, but its origin is unknown, the dictionary said.
In the Sept. 27 news story about nincompoop children, Beth J. Harpaz, an Associated Press writer, talked about second-graders who can’t tie shoes or zip jackets, 4-year-olds in diapers and teens and pre-teens who are befuddled by can openers and ice cube trays.
The story quoted a mom who said that her kids struggle with coat hangers and that her teenager daughter doesn’t know how to use a can opener. Meanwhile, Harpaz noted, a 12-year-old who visited her house didn’t know how to remove ice cubes from a tray.
Whose fault is it, anyway?
The rest of the story quotes a person who condemned the younger generation’s lack of skills and another who defended them. Mark Bauerlein, author of “The Dumbest Generation,” argued that kids are confused when technology isn’t available and that there’s a loss of independence and initiative, according to Harpaz’ story.
Meanwhile, Lenore Skenazy, who wrote a book called “Free Range Kids,” said parents are partly to blame for children’s apparent incompetence. Parents are told kids need to go to Gymboree or their children won’t learn to hum or clap. Meanwhile, she said they’re also pressured to buy some kind of contraption to teach them to walk.
My thinking on who to blame for raising nincompoops falls into Skenazy’s camp.
If kids are nincompoops it’s because their parents are encouraging them to be that way. Kids have no incentive to do things for themselves or get themselves out of a bind if their parents do everything for them.
Consequences
I’m a firm believer that adversity builds character and that if kids never have to solve conflicts, they won’t have any survival skills. So maybe instead of hand-wringing, parents should teach their kids how to use a can opener or put their clothes on a hanger. After the kids are shown how to do it, the parents should step out of the way. If their kids still are perplexed about how to get the contents out of a sealed can or leave their clothes on the floor they can deal with the consequences.
It’s unlikely that the children will starve and it’s their problem if their clothes lay on the floor and they wear wrinkled garments to school. Going a little hungry and being slightly unkempt may be incentive enough to learn the mechanics of can openers and hangers. If it’s not, again, it’s the kids’ problem and as parents, we have to grit our teeth and live with kids who complain they’re hungry and who wear rumpled clothes.
The other point that Harpaz’ story brings up, that kids are nincompoops because society is pressuring parents, from the moment their children are born, to take them to classes and buy gadgets for them also is valid.
It’s true that parents today get a lot of expert advice coming at them from all sides and from a variety of sources. Not only are there parenting magazines, newspapers and books filled with advice on how to raise kids, there also is a plethora of information on the Internet.
Just say no
Still, I don’t think parents can use information overload as an excuse for raising clueless kids. Our job as parents is to sift through the information, retain what’s useful and dismiss the rest. A lot of parenting comes down to using common sense and determining what will be best for the child in the long run.
If that means that a child doesn’t get a cell phone when he or she is 9 years old, then the child — and parents — will learn to deal with it. Some parents may find it hard to believe, but, my sons, who are 13 and 11, do not have their own phones. They use the family home phone if they need to call someone, just like I did when I was their age. Or, if they’re at a friend’s house, they ask to use the phone.
Sometimes, that turns into a learning experience. Recently one of my sons needed to make a phone call from a house that still had a rotary phone. He learned a lesson in dialing the old-fashioned way that day and thought it was pretty “cool.”
Trust
While it makes some parents uneasy that they can’t call their kids to check up on them when they’re not with them, it doesn’t bother me. I figure if they’re at their friends’ houses, their friends’ parents are keeping an eye on them. If the kids decide to go out and explore the woods or ride their bikes around town, then I trust my sons’ good judgment to stay safe.
That philosophy has worked so far and I plan to keep embracing it when my children are older. I hope to resist the temptation to constantly call them to get updates on where they are and who they’re with. I want to raise children who are independent, responsible adults and I think that allowing them some space is the way to do that. If they make mistakes, and they likely will, then they will have to deal with the consequences.
The decision not to give our sons cell phones doesn’t mean that Brian and I eschew all technology. The boys and Ellen have a variety of electronic gadgets, big and small, to keep them entertained. They also have board games, horses to ride, footballs, basketballs and baseballs. They enjoy them all. Life is about balance and as I see it, technology can fit into the balance.
Chores also are an important part of the equation. Our children are expected to help keep the house clean, the yard mowed and the buildings painted. If, as the article says, many kids aren’t doing chores, I feel sorry for them. I think raising children who are helpless is setting them up for a rude awakening when they are adults and have to live on their own.
That is, unless their parents plan to take care of the kids when they’re adults. While some parents seem to be OK with doing that, I’m not..

When horticulturalist and sustainable gardening expert Jeff Epping daydreams about his field of study, he sees a meadow.
Epping, a featured speaker at this year's March Garden Day in Grand Haven, will challenge gardeners to reimagine their landscapes to include a “fescue meadow that has spring flowering bulbs that would be mowed two or three times a year, and require limited water and chemicals.”
“We like to replace Kentucky bluegrass turf when that’s possible,” Epping said.
The annual March Garden Day, with the theme "A Celebration of Gardening," is 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday at the Grand Haven Community Center, 421 Columbus Ave.
Organized by the West Michigan Nursery and Landscape Association, March Garden Day attracts approximately 300 gardeners of all skill levels from across the state. The event offers lively and informative programs, a garden market filled with vendors and greenery, and a welcome peek at the growing season to come.
In his program titled “Sustainable Gardens: Designs and Plants for Greener Gardens,” Epping acknowledges the need for lawn areas for recreation, but suggests many other ways gardeners can “go green” in their home landscape, such as making smart plant choices.
“We’re looking at plants that are as disease-hardy as possible, and matched to the garden we’re putting them in — not just because they look good,” he said.
Smart plant choices minimize the use of water and chemicals, Epping said.
Epping, director of horticulture for Olbrich Botanical Gardens in Wisconsin, will also discuss “Small Trees with Big Impact.” He’ll be joined by Chuck Martin, curator of woody plants for Dow Gardens in Midland, who will present “Shrub Roses: A New American Love Affair.”
Martin said the shrub rose’s profusion of blooms, disease resistance and general ease of care has allowed it to grasp a huge share of the market once dominated by the comparatively fussy hybrid teas.
“It’s definitely where the rose industry is going,” he said.
Martin will help gardeners sort out the myriad “brand” shrub roses on the market today.
The daylong seminar also includes break-out sessions with plant and garden experts covering topics such as: adding color with bulbs, vertical gardening, deer-resistant plants, rain gardens, bees and other pollinators, and propagating azaleas.
Registration for the seminar is $45 in advance and $50 at the door. A gourmet box lunch, provided by Grand Haven’s Landyacht Bake House, is included in the price of the ticket.
To pre-register and reserve your space at March Garden Day, visit Grand Haven Garden House in Grand Haven or Jonker’s Gardens in Holland. For additional information, visit wmnla.com.
The West Michigan Nursery & Landscape Association is a nonprofit organization of gardening and landscape professionals. Proceeds from March Garden Day, including a silent auction, help support the association’s efforts to aid horticulture education.

So…there’s a big, big world out there of repurposing vintage furniture, doors, dishes, jewelry anything that needs a face lift. I find it quite fulfulling to take a vintage piece that really can’t be displayed or used in its current condition and discover a way to morph it into it’s next productive life!
I even have a Pinterest Board dedicated to such, called Vintage Repurposed. This board is to collect ideas from everyone who has found a way to repurpose something once loved and regal into a new and exciting product.
For example, a friend gave me a stunning acrylic brooch which must have made a loud statement of fashion during the “Flower Power” era but the pretty green paint had begun peeling and some of the petals were missing. I added a few new touches covering the peeled spots with new gem stones and faux pearls and a vintage goldtone ear bob with a large pearl to cover the missing petals. Finally, I added a florist butterly to the center to nuzzle the original yellow and black acrylic center and there it was…a beautiful repurposed brooch. Still vintage and yet new.
This 1960′s Acrylic Brooch is ready to be added to a bright colored lapel, funky bag purse, colorful scarf or floppy hat to ride the fashion wave…again!
Click here to see my Grandma’s Treasures Online Facebook Photo Album of vintage buttons, watches, and jewelry making a debut into fun repurposed creations!
What do you have in your drawer, closet or garage that could find a new life? Be inspired!

The basic English translation of Om mani padme hum is "Om Jewel in the Lotus Hum" or "Praise to the Jewel in the Lotus." However, the meaning and significance of the six Tibetan syllables have been interpreted in a variety of ways. One common interpretation is that each syllable corresponds to one of the six realms of existence and purifies the vice associated with that realm:
•Om purifies bliss and pride (realm of the gods)
•Ma purifies jealousy and need for entertainment (realm of the jealous gods)
•Ni purifies passion and desire (human realm)
•Pad purifies ignorance and prejudice (animal realm)
•Me purifies poverty and possessiveness (realm of the hungry ghosts)
•Hum?"

Gosh, we’ve missed you, Luella. It’s great that you’re writing a book and everything, but really, now that it’s summertime, we NEED your girly accessories and super-feminine clothes. Sigh. But what’s a girl to do? After Bartley’s investors pulled out in December, the label folded, and Luella’s boutique on Brook street has since shut down. And now our first Luella-less season is hurtling towards us!
So, imagine our delight to be contacted by the girls at Cocosa (the invitation-only fashion website that offers its members designer clothing and accessories at up to 80% off) who were completely over-excited to tell us that they have a genius competition going live at lunchtime today.
Cocosa are offering their members the chance to win a pair of Michael Lewis for Luella shoes made exclusively for Luella’s final S/S ‘10 show (* sobs *). The shoes are supercute, and available in a size 39 only (sorrreee!).
To enter the competition, and win the last pair of Luella shoes left on the planet (probably) just use the invite code iwantshoes, to become a member.

Two Birds Artisan Spirits looks for landing
Although craft beer and locally produced wine have taken the lead in a growing Michigan craft beverage industry, artisan spirits are also emerging, such as Two Birds Artisan Spirits.
Eventually, Two Birds will likely find a permanent home in Michigan, but, for now, it provides Michiganders another artisan spirit choice in an unusual way.
Co-founder Nathan Jonjevic said him and his partner, Ryan Bailey, are “gypsy distillers.” The pair currently makes their Greyling Modern Dry Gin at Yahara Bay, a Madison, Wisc.-based distillery.
“Right now, you can buy a still and a building and go through the (licensing) process, which takes six to 18 months,” Jonjevic said. “So we could be operational in a building and not be allowed to produce for a long time.”
Making matters even more confusing, Jonjevic lives in Missouri, while Bailey calls Michigan home.
It might not seem very Michigan based, but the pair has made a point to source almost exclusively from the Mitten State.
They use a hard red winter wheat and lavender from Northern Michigan in the gin. They only ingredients they struggle with are juniper and citrus peels.
“We source everything from Michigan that we can,” Jonjevic said.
For now, Two Birds will only make the gin, potentially expanding the line in 2014.
The focus now is expanding the market, Jonjevic said, which currently is Missouri and Michigan.
They do have plans to begin distribution this year to Washington, D.C., Maryland, Delaware, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
“Distilling is funny,” Jonjevic said. “People get into it, because they think it’s a beautiful process — and then it’s all marketing. That’s what we’re doing right now.”

Teacher quality
Principal leadership
Parent involvement
My kids were in Daniel's run Elementary school, I had to move them because one of my son had a lot of troubles, yes St Leo ipis very strict and there are more rules than other school, my kids are doing great the teachers are so professional and the most important think Religion is the best, I'm very happy that they've been educating by good teachers, they are safe, professionalism I give them 10 stars ;) God Bless you guys
This is a great school my kids are happy, teachers are always there with the answers for all the questions they are great ;)
The middle school teachers at this school are extremely biased, they favor The girls over boys, the front office staff are just blatantly rude when they found out I was transferring out of this school, the vice principal kept questioning us about why we were transferring. The students there were great, However there was alot of hatred and discontent towards many teachers though. There are barely any students, about 400. For pre-K through 8th grade.
Great school, excellent Christian formation, great education, friendly and knowledgeable faculty. We have our two daughters at Saint Leo since Pre-School. We have seen many children of our friends and even though we are aware that most of the Christian foundation is provided at home, we are also aware that reinforcement and dedication will make the difference. We made a great decision and can see the difference with other kids even from other religious schools. Public schools were never an option, as we can see all the problems and exposure the new generations need to live in. I was shocked when I read about the parent who was not even happy with the Principal. On the contrary, the Principal, Mr. DiPippa makes really the difference. We strongly recommend this school, one of the feeders to Paul IV, another excellent Religious school in Fairfax and where my daughters will go after they graduate from 8th grade.
Last year was my last year at St. Leo's. To start, the administration is terrible. The principal doesn't even do their job so they leave it to the vice principal to do everything. They care more about the dress code than student actually achieving good grades. Also, they care more about what the middle schoolers are doing on Facebook than anything else. And I'll probably get tracked down for writing this review. Seeing as I have a limited amount of characters on this review, I can't really write about personal experiences but there is a list of MANY. The middle school teachers favor female students over male students to an EXTREME extent. The science teacher thinks it is her duty to reveal her whole personal life such as telling her students that it is THEIR FAULT that she can't watch Jeopardy and American Idol every night. Also, extremely incompetent considering it is almost June and my 7th sister has made it through only 4 chapters in their text book. They absolutely do NOT put religion as a priority. I enjoy the fact that my religion teacher last year taught about sexism and she is the biggest sexist in the whole school. I'd advise you to take your money elsewhere. 0 stars
I have had two children in St Leos if they had not changed principals my youngest would not be there. With a change in the church and the new staff at the school it is better. But I agree that it is too much run like a public school for my taste. I don't want PC I want a strong base with a Christian basis and St Leos does not do this well, When she gets to middle school will really be the test.
I was shocked to read the review from the parent who said that religion was not a priority or incorporated. We have had the absolute opposite experience. The priests are engaged with the children, my children have weekly assignments in religion - between writing reports on saints to memorizing prayers - all of my children learn a great deal about the faith and religion as a whole. Of course, even being able to mention God, Jesus and the Holy Trinity is leaps and bounds ahead of what the children are allowed to be exposed to in public school. Kudos to Saint Leo s! Keep up the good work!
This is a good but not a great school. My children attended the local public school for two years prior and had better academic programs there. We transferred to this school due to the expectation that religion would be incorporated into the curriculum, but that has been spotty at best. Religion is not a priority for the administration, so if the teacher makes time for it great, but it is not consistent throughout the school. Administration more concerned about finances of the school than quality of the school, has a tendency to act more like a private school than a parochial school.
We have been extremely happy with the school. My son attended two years of preschool here and is now enrolled in their full-day K program. The teachers are exceptional and have shown a great deal of caring towards the students. The preschool emphasizes learning through play and is like a small family with low teacher/student ratios. The school recently upgraded all their equipment and has interactive whiteboards, etc. in all the classrooms (including K, where they project the books being read that day, etc.). The academic standing of the school is excellent. My son enjoys going to school everyday!
We are extremely pleased with the quality of eduaction that our children are receiving at St Leo's. The faculty and staff are professional and nuturing which is the perfect blend. As with any school, there have been issues but they are quickly reviewed and addressed.
A National Blue Ribbion School that has a wonderful community that focuses on the whole student. Religion and Spanish are part of the core curriculum. Parent participation and engagement is the norm.
This school is absolutely wonderful! The teacher's are well educated and well informed. They respect the students' differences and bring out the best in them. Administration is cooperative and the front office staff is always cheerful and helpful. Both my children attended St. Leo's from preschool to grade 8. They were well prepared for high school!
This is the best elementary/middle school in the area! Selected as a 2006 'Blue Ribbon School' by the US Dept. of Education this year, it is known for its consistent high standards of excellence in the spiritual, academic, and technological preparation of children in grades PreK-8. The principal is top-notch as are the teachers. We wouldn't send our children anywhere else!
The staff at St. Leo's is good but not great. he real problem is the administration. The answer to everything is get a tutor. If the teachers are doing their job then they would not need a tutor. The school is poorly run and the teachers reflect that. For the most part this school could turn around quickly if they replaced the administration.
Education is average to good. The main issue with the school is the Principal, Mrs. Drews, and the Administrative staff. They are not friendly, nor working well with parents. They treat parents like children --> one way communications. Enrollment is at the lowest point. Unless the school staff starts showing attention and care to students, the school will not improve. Facilities are old and poor. The Extended Day Care program does not provide enrichment program to students, as everyone congregates at the school gym with basketball hoops and a small climbing wall. The school gym is also used as the cafeteria at lunch time. From former parents.
Teaching,Administration, and Maintenance staff are outstanding. They are thorough and informative. The atmosphere is challenging! I like the way the teachers take control and run the classes. My kids are in 3rd and 6th grades. The learning environment is filled with love and positive feedback. My kids feel very secure and happy here. I wish St. Leos went to 12th grade. The parent support with school activities is also excellent. I have a hard time getting my kids to leave the extended day program because they enjoy it so much.

This table summarizes the meaning of various strings in different regexp syntaxes. It is intended as a quick reference, rather than a tutorial or specification. Please report any errors.
BRE refers to POSIX "basic regular expressions" and ERE is POSIX "extended regular expressions".
grep is supposed to use BREs, except that grep -E uses EREs. (GNU grep fits some extensions in where POSIX leaves the behaviour unspecified). egrep uses EREs. grep -F doesn't use regexps at all, of course.
ed uses BREs. ex and vi use BREs but additionally support \< and \> as described above, and use ~ to match the replacement part of the previous substitution.
expr uses BREs with all patterns implicitly anchored at the start.
awk is supposed to use EREs, plus the extra C-style escapes \\, \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v with their usual meanings. sed is supposed to use BREs, plus \n with its usual meaning.
lex is also supposed to use EREs with some extensions: "..." quotes everything inside it (backslash escapes are recognized); an initial <state> matches a start condiiton; r/x matches r only when followed by x; and {name} matches the value of a substitution symbol. A variety of escape sequences, including the usual C ones, are recognized. Possibly this deserves a new column.
regcomp uses BREs by default but can also use EREs. It has a variety of other options which modify the syntax slightly.
Boost's regex++ supports a variety of syntaxes.
PCRE is almost the same as Perl, though it doesn't support the embedded Perl feature and the man page lists a number of other differences.
Vim has enough differences and extensions that it perhaps deserves a column (or two) to itself.
Subexpressions or groups are surrounded by ( and ), or sometimes \( and \). They serve two purposes; firstly they override the precedence rules of other operators, and secondly they "capture" part of the text matched by a regexp. This can then be used later on in the regexp via the \digit syntax (this is called a back-reference) or outside the regexp to extract the appropriate part of a string.
"Shy grouping" has the precedence-overriding feature but not the capturing feature.
"Symbolic grouping" allows groups to be identified by name rather than number.
The syntax of this varies a bit; sometimes you used \{ and \}, and sometimes you use { and }. However the idea is the same:
It is worth nothing that the GNU Grep manual says:
Traditional `egrep' did not support the `{' metacharacter, and some `egrep' implementations support `\{' instead, so portable scripts should avoid `{' in `egrep' patterns and should use `[{]' to match a literal `{'.
This refers to expressions in [square brackets], for which POSIX defines a complicated syntax all of their own.
Firstly, if the first character after the [ is a ^ (caret) then the sense of the match is reversed.
The rest of the bracket expression consists of a sequence of elements selected from the following list. The bracket expression as a whole matches any character (or character sequence) that is matched by at least one of them (or is matched by none of them, if an initial ^ was used).
1. Collating symbols. These look like [.element.], where element is a collating element (i.e. a symbolic name for a multi-character string), and match the value of the collating element in the current locale. This doesn't seem to work in GNU grep.
2. Equivalence classes. These look like [=element=], where element is a collating element. They match any collating element (single or multiple characters) which has the same primary weight as element, i.e. if they appear in the same place in the current locale's collation sequence. This doesn't seem to work in GNU grep.
3. Character classes. These look like [:class:], where class is the name of the character class to match. The following character classes exist in all locales:
[:alnum:] [:alpha:] [:blank:] [:cntrl:] [:digit:] [:graph:] [:lower:] [:print:] [:space:] [:upper:]
4. Range expressions. These look like start-end where start and end are either single characters or collating symbols. The behaviour is only specified in the POSIX locale, where they match all the characters between start and end inclusive.
5. Single characters. These match themselves.
To include a ], put it immediately after the opening [ or [^; if it occurs later it will close the bracket expression. The hyphen (-) is not treated as a range separator if it appears first or last, or as the endpoint of a range.
Emacs "character sets" are similar to bracket expressions, except that collating symbols, equivalence classes and character classes aren't supported.
Perl "character classes" are also similar. They support POSIX character class syntax (argh, confusing names!) and recognize, but don't support, collating symbols or equivalence classes.
GNU Grep has slightly strange handling of . and newlines.
Firstly, the manual says that . matches "any single character". Superficially it appears not to match the newline character:
$ echo | grep . $
The outcome is actually in keeping with standard and traditional behaviour for grep, where the newline is not included in the text to be matched. But that doesn't appear to be quite what's going on with the GNU version, as explicitly searching for a newline does produce a match:
$ echo | perl -e 'exec("/usr/bin/grep","\n");' $
So is there a newline to match against or not?
The other case to consider is when the -z or --null-data option is used. In that case, . definitely does match a newline, exactly as the manual says:
$ perl -e 'print "\n\0";' | grep -z . | od -tx1 0000000 0a 00 0000002 $
The /s modifier changes the meaning of . to match any haracter including \n.
The /m modifier causes ^ and $ to match at the start of any line within the subject string rathe than just the start and end of the subject string.
Perl's lookbehind matches, i.e. (?<=p) and (?<!p) only work for fixed-width patterns, not arbitrary regular expressions.
The POSIX regular expression specification can be found at. For the regexp languages used by particular programs, I looked at the documentation for GNU Grep 2.4.2; GNU Emacs 21.2.1; Perl 5.6.1; Python 2.2.1; and Tcl 8.3.3.
All errors are my own!

Last Monday, Freakonomics had a post called How About Them (Wrapped) Apples? suggesting that packaging on foods is a good thing because "in addition to protecting food from its microbial surroundings, packaging significantly prolongs shelf life, which in turn improves the chances of the food actually being eaten." Later in the article, the author suggests that Americans waste half of all the food they buy.
The same day, Arduous took up the argument with the assertion, "If the waste trade-off is either the plastic bag for a bag of pre-washed lettuce, or an entire head of lettuce that rotted before you got to eating it, I would probably say to go with the bag of lettuce."
I have all sorts of opinions that I could toss into the discussion (none of them on the side of food packaging), but for me, one of the main issues seems to be that Americans don't know how to store produce. Why buy lettuce in a plastic bag when you can keep it crisp for just as long in your fridge without a bag? If you know how...
I bought this head of lettuce last Wednesday. On Monday when I took the picture, it was still in perfect condition. The carrots came in my CSA box last Thursday. By Monday, they were getting floppy, so I chopped them up and put them in a bowl of water. They crisped right back up.
How to Store Specific Vegetables
Cut the tops off of carrots and store in a container of water. Periodically change out the water. We generally buy carrots once a month, and they will last all month if stored this way.
Celery can be stored the same way.
Wrap lettuce in a damp cloth and store in a container with a lid.
Keep kale, collards, cabbage, and other greens wrapped in a damp cloth. The outer leaves will go bad first - simply peel them off and eat the inner leaves.
Potatoes should be kept in a cool, dark place.
Onions should also be stored in a cool, dark place, preferably not touching. One tip I've seen is to store onions in old panty hose, twisting the hose in between onions to keep them from touching.
Cut the greens off of root vegetables. Store the greens separate from the vegetables.
Extra Random Tips
Most vegetables will last longer if you wrap them in a damp cloth.
Plan meals so you eat the most likely to spoil veggies first.
If you get fresh vegetables from a CSA or farmer's market, it's best to hold off on washing them until you're going to use them.
On the other hand, if you're more likely to choose fresh fruits and vegetables as a snack if you can grab and go, take 30 minutes after your shopping trip to peel, cut, and store your veggies. Put carrots and celery sticks in a bowl of water. Wrap cucumber slices and broccoli trees in a damp towel. Wash fruit and put it in an easy to access bowl on the counter.
If That's Not Enough
Fake Plastic Fish recently linked to a huge document about how to store fruits and vegetables without plastic: HowTo: Store Fruits and Vegetables - Tips and tricks to extend the life of your produce without plastic (at the bottom of the post)
What tips do you have for storing fruits and vegetables?
19 comments:
Just a note: storing cut vegs in water will leach nutrients so water should then be used as stock or baked into bread or other baked goods so vitamins are not thrown out.
Erin, this is priceless! Thank you--this is absolutley info I will use. I'm one of those people who all-too-often loses the produce to rot, and nine times out of ten it used to do its rotting INSIDE the plastic produce bag I bought it in. Oddly (or not!) since switching to mesh bags a lot of problems have gone away, but your suggestions will help us a lot! Thanks--
Jenn
I cannot tell you how helpful this post is! Thank you!
@Olivia - Great point. I often use the carrot or celery water when I'm making broth, but I hadn't thought of using it in bread. Love that idea.
I learned from my mom to also put radishes (cleaned up and ready to eat) in water.
Great tips!
Kathy
Thank you so much for this list! I also wrap my lettuce in a damp towel and it lasts over a week, did not know about the carrots, though. Another tip - store apples away from other fruit and veggies since they emit Ethylen which will cause other fruits and veggies to ripen faster.
Great post Erin!
If we're going to throw something (food or plastic) away anyway, I'd much rather throw a rotten head of lettuce into my compost heap than a plastic bag into the landfill.
We store asparagus standing up in the fridge with the bottoms in a bowl of water. Also, store bananas away from your other produce. Keeping bananas close to all your other fruit will make it go bad much faster.
Putting potatoes in a paper bag helps keep them good. I just use one that my in-laws had, since I don't get any.
Also I have an award for you on my blog-
Thanks for the link! My favorite tip of all is immersing carrots and celery in water. We've been doing it for years and they stay crispy for many weeks. Not that it takes us that long to eat them.
Glad you responded to that Freekonomics article. It pissed me off.
@Beth - Me too - I fumed to my husband about it for days. They got so many things wrong in that article.
like Kellie says, asparagus + fresh herbs if you're buying not growing, do well standing up in a cup of water. I freeze a lot of extra herbs as well -- and make veggie broth from peelings and such, so if something is a little past prime but not rotting, I throw it in my freezer bag for the next broth batch. Love this post....
This is great, just a little bit of water on a cloth can make a huge difference in the quality of your produce- you just have to remember to do it right after you get home. We use foil to wrap our celery and have found that it stays really crisp this way for weeks and you don't lose nutrients by soaking them in water. Even better, you can reuse the foil every time you buy celery preventing you from producing more waste.
Great tips, thanks! I'm going to try the carrots/celery in water. Then, to use up all the leftover veg I always make a quick pureed veg soup at the end of the week - just boil the veg in stock, season, whizz with immersion blender (the best kitchen gadget!) and maybe drizzle in some cream if you're feeling naughty. Yum!
Great tips. I've found that the store in water trick also works for olives and fresh mozzarella, as long as you keep remembering to change the water.
@Jenn the Greenmom - I too have discovered that produce seems to keep longer in mesh produce bags. Glad to know it's not all in my head.
Great tip about lettuce! I store onions, potatoes and carrots in our garage because it is cool and dark. They have been lasting forever.
Great tips. Thanks a lot for the advice. They're very helpful.
When you put the carrots or celery in a bowl of water is it one with a top? and do you mean to store them in the fridge that way?
when you said to cut up the carrots/celery, do you put them in a bowl with a top??
and also do you store them in your fridge?
really appreciate your help :)

When my son entered a new nursery school at the age of 3, I arrived to pick him up on his first day to hear two mothers having a conversation about how well their kids were reading and how they had hoped that this particular nursery school would continue to enhance their children's academic performance.
Curious about how my son had done on his first day, I checked in with his teacher, who reported that he had been particularly "friendly and polite."
I thought to myself, "Well, he might not be reading at the age of 3, but hearing that he's friendly and polite is the kind of feedback I want to hear. That's the person that I want my son to be."
When my daughter was in second grade, she had a teacher that would reward the students for random acts of kindness.
These random acts included times when a student would offer to help another student, when a student would compliment another student or when a student would offer appreciation toward others. There were many times that my daughter would earn this type of reward.
And each time she would come home with one, I would once again shake my head and smile thinking, "I'm so proud of her. She's becoming a good, caring person." As parents it's all too easy for us to get caught up in our children's grades, reading levels, the age they completed their first "chapter book," whether or not they've been chosen for advanced placements, etc. Of course we want to know that our children are reaching appropriate milestones and are performing well. But despite my conscious attempts to not compare my children to others, I have occasionally found myself doing just the opposite and got caught up in academic competition.
Mind you, I've never felt that my children are competing with their friends and classmates. Academic competition seems to be among parents. Granted, I've been blessed with three children who are all good students.
But somehow, I've become overly sensitive to statements like, "My child read his first book at the age of 2," or, "My child could recite the Periodic Table of Elements at the age of 3." When I hear that I just want to scream, "My children have been complimented for becoming good, caring people!" I'm not suggesting that smart children don't have good manners. And of course it's a wonderful accomplishment when a child has a special talent or excels in something. But sometimes I feel like we focus so much of our attention on how advanced our children can be that we often take the risk of missing out on enjoying the people our children are growing up to become.
When we feel like we're becoming trapped in the world of academic competition and questioning ourselves about our children's educational achievements, perhaps we might want to stand back and take a look at who our children have become. How do they interact with their friends? Are they sensitive? Polite? Do they reach out to others? Do they assert themselves appropriately? Do they show empathy? Sympathy?
I'm proud to admit that when I ask myself these questions I am constantly reminded of how proud I am and how much I truly enjoy the people that they have grown to become. And most importantly, they are proud of themselves.
I truly believe that as parents we have quite a bit of influence on our children's education. If we are positive, involved and invested in their education then it only stands to reason that they will have a positive experience. With that said, however, perhaps we can spend less time competing with each other and instead devote that time investing into the development and recognition of our children's character.
Think about it. When the day comes that they are applying to colleges, nowhere on the application will it ask "what reading level were they in first grade," and "how old were they when they first recited Shakespeare." What will matter the most is the person they have grown up to become.

STAMFORD -- Building and Land Technology's path toward redeveloping the South End waterfront into a hedge fund headquarters suffered a potentially damaging blow this week after a chorus of attacks made during a state public hearing on its proposal to relocate a working boatyard to Shippan.
"This whole thing is a joke," said Charles Weiner, an 88-year-old Stamford resident and longtime boater during a Wednesday public hearing at the Government Center held by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
Referring to the South End peninsula where the Harbor Point developer last year dismantled the city's largest working boatyard, he voiced the sentiment that seemed to be widely shared in the audience.
"The boatyard property is sacred, it's designated and mandated," he said. "Why would you want to change it?"
For months, critics have attacked BLT's proposal to erect a boatyard on a 3.5-acre site at 205 Magee Ave. as both an unworkable and blatantly unfair solution.
The project aims to re-establish services to the city's boating community in the aftermath of the developer's decision to raze a 14-acre boatyard in the South End without zoning approval. With the support of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, BLT is seeking to rezone that site from a strictly water-dependent use into a $750 million office headquarters for the Westport hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.
Wednesday's hearing, which came on the heels of a city-commissioned report released Tuesday that identified severe deficiencies with the Shippan plan, was the first public opportunity for opponents to bring their case against to the state. The DEEP has granted BLT a draft permit to perform in-water boating-related construction as well as dredging along the shore of 205 Magee Ave.
More than 100 people, mostly boaters, showed up for the proceedings. About a dozen, several with detailed slideshows, took turns speaking at the podium. Among the repeatedly raised objections was whether BLT's application should have been considered by the DEEP because the property it owns at 205 Magee Ave. does not include a critical 4,200-square-foot parcel bordering the waterfront.
In December, Mayor Michael Pavia signed a letter of intent that gives BLT the right to include the city's property in its development plans as well as the right to negotiate for rights to it in the future. But many, including city board members, have called the validity of the agreement into question, raising questions about the parcel's intended status as part of a park. Representatives from the city's Harbor Management Commission also challenged the DEEP's decision to grant the permit, citing environmental concerns. Last month, the commission ruled the project is not consistent with the city's harbor-management plan, in large part because the dredging involved would affect tidal wetlands.
Safety concerns about the boatyard's proposed location on a narrow and heavily trafficked portion of the eastern channel of Stamford Harbor were voiced by boaters and businesses alike. Among the speakers, a spokesman for O&G, an asphalt manufacturer that uses barges, said that the plan as designed would impede the company's operations and cause accidents.
To date, the agency that is charged with protecting water-dependent uses has not addressed BLT's unauthorized removal of the South End boatyard, which the city has said constitutes a violation of the Coastal Area Management Act.
"The elephant in the room tonight is that what this company is attempting to do is take a 14-acre piece of land and eliminate a water-dependent use," said Peter Alviti, director of programs for the New England Laborers' Health & Safety Fund.
Afterward, John Freeman, an attorney for BLT, refuted some of the environmental and safety allegations. Dredging, he said, would not affect any portion of the tidal wetlands, which he said the DEEP had concurred with. He said the developer would offer a full response to the criticisms on Feb. 20, when the hearing is to continue at the DEEP's offices in Hartford. The public has until Feb. 13 to submit further written comments.
Despite being clearly outnumbered by opponents, Freeman said he was gratified to see growing support for the boatyard plan. He pointed to a petition signed by more than 400 South End residents as well as the three individuals who spoke in favor.
Among them was Stamford boater Paul Norton, who called BLT's ultimate aim of developing the South End for Bridgewater as one that "will bring a lot of high-paying jobs."
Of the Shippan plan, he said, "I'd like to see a ball rolled toward getting a boatyard in Stamford."
He then added, "Personally, I don't think there's ever going to be a 14-acre boatyard in Stamford."
As he wrapped up, he was met with disapproving headshakes and some boos. One person, however, could be heard clapping in the back.
"That's my wife," he confessed, with a smile.

Hey, folks!
Something’s cooking on ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ (as always) and apparently it doesn’t look good. Check out this spoiler below the cut!
Is Grey’s Anatomy planning a ruinous return to ABC next month?
Maybe. This has not been confirmed by the network, but there are rumors that another disaster may strike the hospital – and not of the fiscal variety. We’ll get to that in a second. First, here’s what we do know:
On March 14, the show returns with “Transplant Wasteland.”
For the actual “spoiler”, please visit the source site below!
What say you about this? Hit me with your honest thoughts. I’d love to hear ‘em
LongLiveGA! GreytXcape

Also called third molars, wisdom teeth usually make their first appearance in young adults between the ages of 17 and 21. Usually, an initial evaluation of the wisdom teeth should be performed between the ages of 16 and 19. Because most mouths are too small for these four additional molars, an extraction (removal) procedure is often necessary.
The following signs and, many dentists will opt to monitor them over time. If the wisdom teeth are causing problems or are likely to cause problems, most oral health specialists will recommend immediate removal of the teeth to help:
Bacteria and plaque buildup
Cyst impacted tooth needs to be removed to allow the tooth to be extracted. Also, the tooth may need to be cut into sections to remove it.
Most wisdom teeth extractions are performed in the dentist's office under local anesthesia. People who are particularly anxious should consult their dentist or oral surgeon about supplements to local anesthesia or alternative forms of anesthesia.

"Policies" in this report are government policies. They are formulated against the larger background of national and international events and trends, and result from millions of decisions within the existing and only slowly changing cultural, economic, and military balances. Their implementation often poses considerable problems if they represent longer-term interests and insights.
Government policies are among the dynamics that influence population growth, economic and social development, technological change, resource exploitation, and pollution management. While the role of policy has been touched upon occasionally in earlier sections, government policy development can be thought of as a process in itself. The role of policies in SRES needs to be considered, partly because governments are one of the primary audiences for the scenarios and partly because the scenarios are intended to form a reference against which mitigation strategies can be assessed (although, as stated earlier, the SRES terms of reference require the SRES scenarios to not consider any explicit climate policies).
GHG emissions are affected by policies designed for a wide variety of purposes. Perhaps the most obvious are energy policies, but other important policy areas are those of economic development, technology development, education, health, social welfare, transport, industry, agriculture, and forestry. Policies in each of these areas also affect other areas. In each policy area various instruments are used. The choice of instrument may influence both the policy's success in achieving its primary objective and its effect on GHG emissions. Taxes, subsidies, regulations, information-based instruments, and R&D all bring different mechanisms into play and so have different affects.
The remainder of this section is organized around specific policy areas or objectives. It considers major policy issues in each area, and discusses the possible implications for GHG emissions in reference (non-mitigation) scenarios.

This week, community leaders from two small villages in very different parts of the world will meet on Bougainville Island in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to discuss a common problem: their need to relocate as a result of climate change. The communities of Newtok, Alaska, and the Carteret Islands, Papua New Guinea, are among the first in the world to choose relocation as the best means of adapting to the effects of a changing climate and ensuring their cultural survival.

Last Week’s Results
Fri., Oct. 19 - GRIFFINS 3 at Rochester Americans 4 - 0-2-0-1, 1 pt. (T4th, Midwest Division)
Sun., Oct. 21 - GRIFFINS 4 at Toronto Marlies 3 SO - 1-2-0-1, 3 pts. (T3rd)
Three in Three: The Griffins will play the first of this season’s nine three-in-threes this weekend, hosting the Charlotte Checkers on Friday and Rockford IceHogs on Saturday (both games at 7 p.m.) before making their first visit of the season to Chicago to battle the Wolves on Sunday at 5 p.m. EDT. Grand Rapids will play a three-in-three in back-to-back weekends, as it visits San Antonio, Texas and Houston on consecutive days next weekend (Nov. 2-4).
Live by the Sword: A strong penalty kill was the story of the Griffins’ opening weekend, as the unit killed 12 of 13 power plays and scored a league-high two shorthanded goals. Special teams also played a factor in the team’s 4-3 shootout victory over Toronto on Sunday. The penalty kill denied all six Marlies power plays, including two brief 5-on-3 advantages. The Griffins’ power play capitalized on two opportunities in the second period, as Gustav Nyquist scored his first goal of the season to cut a two-goal deficit in half and Tomas Tatar scored late in the second period to bring Grand Rapids within one heading into the third. Nyquist scored again to tie the game in the third period, and was one of three Griffins to score in the shootout to give the team its first win of the season, and Jeff Blashill his first win as the Griffins’ head coach.
Die by the Sword: While special teams drove the Griffins to Sunday’s win, it proved to be the opposite in the team’s 2012-13 road opener at Rochester on Friday. Grand Rapids got out to a two-goal lead but surrendered four unanswered goals to the Americans, including three straight power play goals. The Amerks’ power play was 3-for-5 in their 4-3 victory, while the Griffins’ power play did not capitalize on any of its four opportunities.
Weekend Promotions: Fans attending this Friday’s game versus Charlotte can enjoy $1 hot dogs and $1 domestic drafts from 6-8 p.m., while supplies last. Fans can also ride the Rapid busses to and from any Friday game and enjoy complimentary fare by showing their, which allows fans to have $1 beers and $1 hot dogs served directly to their seats. Call (616) 774-4585 ext. 2 or visit griffinshockey.com/dzone for D-Zone tickets. The first 1,500 fans through the turnstiles before Saturday’s contest versus Rockford will receive a Griffins 2012-13 team calendar, courtesy of Delta Imports. Fans are also encouraged to participate in the team’s Halloween costume contest. Members of the Griffins’ game day staff will patrol the stands and concourse and select the best-dressed fans for a contest that will be held at ice level during the second intermission. The winner will be determined by a round of applause. Finally, for every home game this season is a Military Night. Current members of our military can purchase up to four upper bowl tickets for $13 each (or $11 in advance at The Zone) with a valid military ID. The offer also extends to veterans who present a VA ID or discharge papers.
We Interrupt This Broadcast:. Additionally, the game will be carried on SiriusXM NHL Network Radio (Sirius 207, XM 92), which will air live AHL hockey games nearly every night during the NHL lockout. The current broadcast schedule is available here.
Close Calls: The Griffins are one of just three teams in the AHL, along with Hershey and Milwaukee, to have each of their games decided by one goal. The Griffins lost their season opener to Milwaukee on Oct. 12 (3-2) and picked up a point against Hamilton the following night (3-2 SOL) before splitting decisions last weekend against Rochester (4-3 L) and Toronto (4-3 SOW). Additionally, all four Griffins games this season have featured comebacks after two-goal leads. The Griffins had early 2-0 leads in their losses to Milwaukee and Rochester, and they came back from two-goal deficits in their shootout loss to Hamilton and win against Toronto.
Feels Like the First Time: Griffins forward Tomas Jurco opened the scoring in Friday’s 4-3 loss to Rochester, beating the Amerks’ David Leggio off a centering feed from Trevor Parkes for his first goal and point as a pro. The high-scoring right winger tallied 68 points (30-38—68) in 48 games with the QMJHL’s Saint John Sea Dogs in 2011-12 and added another 29 (13-16—29) in 16 postseason contests. Jurco helped Saint John to three consecutive appearances in the QMJHL finals, earning back-to-back championships and a CHL Memorial Cup title in 2011. The Kosice, Slovakia, native also scored on his first professional shootout attempt to help the Griffins beat the Toronto Marlies 4-3 on Sunday.
Three Cheers: Rookie defenseman and Marysville, Mich., native Chad Billins also picked up his first professional point last weekend, doing so in style with three assists during Sunday’s 4-3 win over Toronto. Billins recorded helpers on the team’s two power play goals by Gustav Nyquist and Tomas Tatar and also helped to set up Nyquist’s second of the game that knotted the game at three and sent it to overtime. Billins’ three-point night was the third by any Griffins defenseman over the last three seasons, joining Logan Pyett (3-0—3 on February 27, 2011) and Doug Janik (1-2—3 on November 11, 2011). He also holds a share of the team scoring lead along with Landon Ferraro, Gustav Nyquist, Tomas Tatar and Nathan Paetsch and is tied for third among AHL rookie blueliners.
Shootout Specialist: Through four games, Jordan Pearce and Tom McCollum have evenly split the Griffins’ goaltending duties, with two starts each. Both of McCollum’s starts have gone into a shootout – a 4-3 shootout loss to Hamilton on Oct. 13 and a 4-3 victory over Toronto on Sunday. The fourth-year pro has stopped six of seven (0.857) opponents in the shootout this season, tying him with Chicago’s Eddie Lack for fourth in the AHL in shootout save percentage. The number also matches McCollum’s shootout save percentage from 2011-12, which was the fourth-highest in the league and second-highest in Griffins franchise history, trailing Drew MacIntyre’s 0.875 mark during the 2005-06 season.
Mr. 300: When he steps on the ice for Friday’s contest versus the Charlotte Checkers, Francis Pare will become the sixth player in franchise history to reach 300 games. Pare, who also ranks second all time in goals (81), sixth in assists (113) and fifth in points (194), has spent his entire five-year professional career with Grand Rapids and finished in the Griffins’ top-five scoring leaders in each of his first four seasons with the team. Pare will join Travis Richards (655), Michel Picard (364), Jamie Tardif (316), Derek Meech (304) and Ryan Oulahen (302) as the only Griffins in the 300 club.
Walleye Watch: Several familiar faces continue to perform well for the ECHL’s Toledo Walleye, who are off to a 2-1 start. Petr Mrazek took his first pro loss on Saturday night when Toledo fell to the Kalamazoo Wings 4-2, despite making 36 saves on 40 shots. Mrazek is 11th in the league with a 0.932 save percentage after his first two professional games. Willie Coetzee is tied for third on Toledo with three points (2-1—3) in three games. Coetzee tallied a goal and a game-high 11 shots on Saturday night. He currently leads the league with 26 shots on goal – twice as many shots as Terry Broadhurst, who is second on Toledo with 13, and 10 shots more than any other player in the ECHL who has played fewer than four games. Andrej Nestrasil also has three points (1-2—3) in three games after recording a three-point night in the Walleye’s season-opener versus Kalamazoo.

St Cloud Library Closed at 3pm Friday Due to Power Outage
Kids' Picture Books
Children's picture books are filled with wonder. Magical things happen on their pages. A picture book can be a place where a child learns right from wrong and learns values such as kindness and honesty. Picture books can make a child laugh out loud (a parent, too) but they can also be educational. Children's picture books can be the foundation of literacy. Reading with a child is one of the great pleasures of parenting, because picture books provide a unique connection between child and adult imagination.
The library has a New Kids' Picture Books list on the New, Best & Fun page tabbed on our catalog. It has a wonderful selection of titles. Some, like Building Our House by Jonathan Bean, help children understand how things work. Others, like The Perfect Hug by Joanna Walsh, are more about how we feel. Browse the list, place holds on books that interest you, and visit the library to see what delightful new books are on the shelves today.

Obama Names Internet Outreach Transition Team
American President-Elect Barack Obama’s internet outreach during his campaign was second-to-none. He used the internet for communications, information dissemination and fundraising with great success and seemingly great appreciation for the medium’s rapid response qualities.
Now, as he builds his transition team, President-Elect Obama has appointed two experienced Web operatives: Macon Phillips, an Internet campaign official, and Jesse Lee, the Democratic Congresssional Campaign Committee’s (and Rahm Emanuel’s) internet operation guru during the 2006 midterm elections.
Macon Phillips was instrumental in running the election campaign's new media department, especially using social networking for communications and outreach.
Jesse Lee was the first to write the blog for the Speaker of the House and was in charge of Democratic National Committee rapid response during the recently concluded election cycle.
All of Obama’s internet related appointments are, of course, interesting and important to GroundReport, since the site would like to continue to grow in access to and communication with the new Administration.
Other Internet related appointments announced today are Deputy Directors of New Media Dan Siroker and Andrew Bleeker, Online Communications: Cammie Croft, and Content Lead: Kate Albright-Hanna.
It has already been reported that President-Elect Obama intends to use his vast resources in communications from social networking sites and email addresses to support his policies when he takes office. Let us hope that he also desires to communicate with Citizen Journalists such as those with GroundReport.

Shopping in Guthrie.
Since Phil Clayton became the owner of TSO Optical 25 years ago, he's transitioned away from the traditional discount-eyewear model and toward a premium, boutique system that delivers higher-caliber frames. Since then, he's found that his smiling customers generally need fewer frame adjustments and less warranty work. Instead of opting for cut-rate glasses that have been blessed with a flashy label, his shop opts for quality glasses made by actual eyewear experts, housing a vibrant collection populated by frames from brands such as Oliver Peoples, Ray-Ban, and Tom Ford. A friendly and knowledgeable staff curates this vast selection, and an onsite optometrist provides prescriptions for both glasses and contacts. TSO Optical fills these frames with lenses made in their own laboratory, an onsite facility that cuts back on turnaround time so that clients get their glasses quickly and don’t have to extend the rental on their seeing-eye eagles.
Fashion meets function at Hip & Swanky, a boutique clothier that carries designer threads, jewelry, and accessories. KUT jeans, for example, pair with handcrafted Old Gringo Western boots that can be dressed up or down with a variety of tops and blouses. Dresses pay homage to the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University, and various fun wallets and jewelry accessorize outfits, much like the high heels in a football player's uniform..

The turnaround began in the run-up to Sydney in 2000 as the first substantial proceeds from the lottery began to flow into sport. There was investment in infrastructure – tracks, swimming pools, velodromes – but crucially also in the structures supporting individual sportsmen and women. There were funds for world-class coaches, such as Jim Saltonstall in sailing and Dave Brailsford in cycling, and for nutritionists and sports psychologists. Also for science and technology where appropriate, ensuring we had the best bikes and boats.
Crucially, the money was not distributed through one statist institution pursuing a centrally determined strategy, but through the varying intermediate bodies, from the Royal Yachting Association to British Cycling. They knew their sport well, could direct the spending where it was most needed, but still had to show – through results – that they deserved the cash. Last but not least was a ruthless approach to picking potential winners and grooming them for success in a world of intensely global competition, all dramatised by the reality that Britain would host the Olympics.
Everything was underpinned not by a raucous jingoism but by a determined pride in what our country now is and to show that we can be the best, a patriotism that allows us to be open to the cream of the world but also to use it for our own purposes. The alchemy is, as we have seen, extraordinarily powerful.
Not only do we need to sustain these principles so they become structurally and culturally embedded for continuing Olympic success, but they should also be applied elsewhere. The problem is that they are born of an ideological hybrid that wrong-foots our political class. They are mostly rooted in liberal social democratic values that understand the importance of public investment, public organisation and institution-building. But they also involve an unashamed recognition that in the end individual application, resolve and will to win are indispensable.
David Cameron and London mayor Boris Johnson are happy to celebrate the element that is rooted in competition, elitism and individual effort. But they flounder the instant the conversation moves to the role of public investment and the necessity of understanding and sustaining our unique sport ecosystem, just as nearly every Labour politician flounders the other way round.
The number of British politicians who understand this hybridity – and will argue for it – is tiny. Michael Heseltine always has and Peter Mandelson finally got there in the dying days of the New Labour government, a government that should have been all about such hybridity but was racked by the desire to show its "business friendliness" and warmth to the City.
In today's government, only Vince Cable consistently argues for it and is thus nicknamed the "anti-business" secretary by many on the right whose understanding of what drives success in modern economies and societies is close to zero. The big point is that success depends on recognising that both elements count.
So what to do economically? The first part of the alchemy is for the state to trigger substantial public investment in everything that supports enterprise – communications, science, knowledge generation and transfer, housing and education. And to do so with purpose and consistency. It should be running at least £30bn a year higher than the Treasury currently spends, financed either by taxation or borrowing, depending on the particular economic conjuncture. Currently, it should be financed by borrowing at the lowest interest rates for 300 years. A plan B should begin immediately with such an ambition.
But that is only the start. The next step is to reproduce sector by sector the kind of ecosystem that sport has developed. There needs to be specialist knowledge, commitment, long-term finance and coaching for business and a new web of intermediate institutions that can do for companies in life sciences, robotics and new materials what the RYA, British Gymnastics and British Cycling have done for sportsmen and women. For example, the fledgling network of "catapults" designed to transfer technology into varying sectors must become centres of open innovation, coaching and support and scaled up quickly so they can reproduce the Olympic effect for business.
But for any of that to work, engaged owners have to be committed to their companies over time and banks need to behave more as business coaches – not sellers of credit and of useless financial products. They need to become organisations that attempt to co-grow the companies in an active partnership, not organisations that opt for money-laundering, Libor manipulation or mis-selling. This will demand a wholesale recasting of Britain's system of business ownership and finance, informed by the same pride and ambition for Britain as our athletes and Olympic crowds have shown.. But such focus is meaningless unless informed by an understanding of what to do and a determination to do it.. But first it has to find politicians who understand the necessity of hybridity. They are not Osborne and Camer

Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney are to star in a film loosely based on the rise and fall of presidential hopeful Howard Dean. The Warner Bros production will be based on a stage-play written by Beau Willimon, a former assistant on the Dean campaign.
Entitled Farragut North, after a Washington Metro station in the heart of the lobbyist district, the film sounds like darker version of Joe Roth's Primary Colours. It tells the tale of a youthful communications guru working for a principled but unorthodox politician who finds himself undone by a slick and corrupt Washington establishment. Currently in rehearsal, Willimon's stage-play is set to open on Broadway in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election. Mike Nichols is directing..

Fans of Ryan Gosling have taken to the streets outside the New York offices of People magazine after the publication named Bradley Cooper their 2011 sexiest man alive, ignoring the Drive star.
Tens of protesters waved pro-Gosling placards ("Ryan was robbed", "Not MY people") outside People's offices on Avenue of the Americas. They wore masks for the actor's face and chanted slogans like "One, two, three, four, Bradley Cooper's such a bore. Five, six, seven, eight, Ryan Gosling's super great!". Meanwhile, several blocks south, another group of protesters were yelling about finance or business or something.
People's executive editor, Liz Sporkin, came out swinging for her rag. "We stand by our man!" she said in a statement. "Bradley Cooper is the whole package. He's gorgeous, talented, brainy, loves his mom, can cook up a storm and speaks fluent French! Who can argue with that?"
"We are devastated," said Matt Stopera, a writer for celebrity news website BuzzFeed and part of the movement People has labelled "Occupy Sexy". "[Gosling's] left arm alone makes him the sexiest man alive. Hello, look at his abs!"
It's not the first time the magazine has made a controversial choice in their search for the sexy. Previous winners of the award, now in its 26th year, have included a non-actor (John F Kennedy Jnr in 1988) and a couple (Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford in 1993). Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt and George Clooney have all been honoured twice, while Mel Gibson was the first winner in 1985.

Domaine de la Romanée Conti-Romanée Conti (France): a legend
The most desirable and exclusive Burgundy. Bottles that come onto the market are sold at prices from 600 to thousands of euros in few days. Best drunk after 15 years in bottle to be able to taste the best vintage on the planet. In 2002 some 1990 magnums were auctioned for 5,800 dollars each. Amongst all the vineyards in the Domaine, Romanée is the most exquisite. Its Pinot Noir grapes give a dense ruby coloured wine, delicate in the mouth and very long.

Leroy Clos Vougeot (France): organic and audacious
With the good work of Lalou Bize-Leroy, organic agriculture is used to produce this Burgundy with an audacious nose, touches of wild fruit and an exquisite smooth and perfumed flavour. A second-place with the soul of big winner.
More [+]
Château Haut Brion (France): a fine blend
A blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot produces this elegant Bordeaux vintage of an inscrutable red. In the nose it is mineral, with notes of wild fruit and coffee beans. Smooth and long-lasting in the mouth.

4.- Château Margaux (France): the dean
At the beginning of the 19th century, the founder of Margaux was the first to separate white wine from red. Since then, excellent Bordeaux is produced on the property. The vintage from 2008 has a fine nose, pure and deep, and a long and fleshy palate.
More [+]
5.- Château Cheval Blanc (France): consistency
The consistency of this Bordeaux shows off its incomparable characteristics, whatever the age of the bottle. Its main variety is Cabernet Franc and the extra shades come from Merlot. Very complex, with aromas of quince, fleshy fruit, coconut, toasted coffee and pepper.
More [+]
6.- Quinta Do Vale Meao (Portugal): Douro makes its point
Another quality red wine that is relatively affordable. Number one from the fast improving Douro, it comes from the renewal of a tradition that, at the end of the 1950s, gave birth to a classic, the Barca Velha. Mature, long and with distinctive touches of black fruits in the nose and mouth.
More [+]
7.- Penfolds Grange (Australia): integrity
This is a model in its country of origin and one of the Top in the world. With great texture, intense and fruity, the Grange remains firmly anchored to its own tradition, and combines the Syrah variety with the Australian climate.

Unprecedented GLAD experiment at the heart of improving oil spill
and at-sea emergency responses
MIAMI
– Scientists have embarked on a 3-week expedition aboard the R/V Walton Smith in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM)
zgök ‘trail’’ deployment, while Dr. Brad Rosenheim at Tulane University led sediment and water sampling along select Florida Panhandle beaches aboard the RV Pelican earlier this summer. Data from Rosenheim’s experiment will help scientists confirm the presence or absence of oil and the type of weathering that has occurred to the oil in both the sedimentary and shore-line water environment.
For a few months following the GLAD experiment, the drifters will continue to drift along the GoM currents. All CARTHE data derived during the project will be shared with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to improve their search and rescue operations.
“This joint research operation between the USCG and CARTHE combines our expertise and resources – it is a partnership that can truly save lives,” said Art Allen, a physical oceanographer with the USCG Office of Search and Rescue in Washington, D.C. Allen worked with CARTHE researcher Bruce Dr. Lipphardt from the University of Delaware to release five drifters by aircraft. The drifters deployed by USCG aircraft in advance of the GLAD experiment helped CARTHE researchers to identify appropriate locations for the larger deployment.
CARTHE’s field work at sea, combined with laboratory experiments and the development of interconnected modeling systems, will produce a comprehensive, four dimensional description of the oil/dispersant fate and transport in the GoM, as well as its impact on other coastal environments across all relevant time and space scales. “Our research goes well beyond the Deepwater Horizon incident,”
Ӧ
zgökmen said. “These experiments are complex and painstaking, but the results will be key to generating vast improvements in how and where emergency responders are deployed in the event of another oil spill or at-sea emergency.”
The CARTHE program includes twenty-six principal investigators from twelve research institutions in eight states. Together these scientists are engaged in novel research through the development of a suite of integrated models and state-of-the-art computations that bridge the scale gap between existing models and natural processes.

Ascalon Catacombs (AC) is a level 35 dungeon that is the first players can undertake in Guild Wars 2. Like the other dungeons in Tyria, there are 3 paths with several bosses overlapping between them all. In this second guide to AC, we take a look at route two: “Detha’s”. – “Detha's.
Room Of Pits
This encounter might appear difficult at first but it’s incredibly easy and incredibly quick. After defeating Kohler you’ll head down into a long rectangular chamber that has an altar towards the back and a series of pull chains. Interacting with these chains results in a series of spikes erupting from the floor, in the water below. When the encounter begins, Gravelings with rush from the back of the room towards the altar (and thus over the spikes) to attack Detha. All you and your party need to do is keep the Gravelings in the middle of the room (away from the altar) so that the spikes, operated by your party, can kill them.
The best tactic here is to have 3 members of your party operate the spikes (one to the front left lever, one to the middle and one to the front right) while the remaining 2 stand in the water in front of Detha. The two tanking at the front will then distract the Graveling’s long enough for them to be spiked, providing Detha enough time to do what she has to do. You will need to keep this up for 20 seconds before the encounter is considered “complete”, at which point you can loot the chest and exit the room, even if there are Graveling’s left.
Roundup
- Place 3 members of your party on the chains (front left, middle and front right).
- Have 2 members of your party stand in the water, in the middle to hold the aggro of the Graveling’s.
- Time the activation of the spikes for when there are large amounts of Graveling’s present as the recharge time is quite long.
- While your chain is recharging, if you have ranged AOE skills it’s a good idea to use them on the Graveling’s before re-using the chain.
- Once you’ve survived the onslaught for 20 seconds, the chest will appear for you to loot.
- You can exit the room and ignore any remaining Graveling’s.
Defending Detha
Easily the most difficult part of the dungeon is the final part before the end boss. As with the previous encounters, you have to defend Detha while she repairs three cannons. When Detha fixes a cannon (roughly 30%) a series of ghosts, of varying professions, will spawn. At this point I’d sincerely suggest you kill the Elementalists and Rangers first followed by monks, mesmers, necromancers and warriors. Personally, I always target the Rangers immediately as their single target attacks really hurt and can kill players in seconds. I then target Elementalists because although they hit hard, their attacks are easier to avoid. When the first wave of Ghosts are killed, Detha will finish the repairs and work her way to the next cannon, where she will once again begin the repairs, with more ghosts appearing for a total of 3 waves. Once all the cannons are repaired, the encounter is finished and the final boss will appear.
Roundup
- Detha will always repair the lower left hand cannon first, followed by the lower right and upper middle.
- Target the ghosts in the following order: Ranger, Elementalist, Monk, Mesmer, Necromancer and Warrior.
- The Elementalist and Necromancer ghosts can cause a great deal of AOE effects so ensure you stay out of their fire.
- If Detha dies, you will have to start again so ensure you protect her.
- Using skills such as Feedback are an excellent way of combating the heavy hitting Rangers.
- Don’t forget to loot the chest!
The Ghost Eater
The easiest boss in all of Ascalon Catacombs is very similar to the Howling King in Hodgins path with the exception that he doesn’t have his shout, but retains his burrowing attack. Replacing the shout is a skill which causes oozes to appear that do little or no damage. All you and your party need to do here is tank-and-spank, while killing any oozes that appear. It’s also useful if one of your party members uses the Frost cannon to keep the Graveling chilled.
Roundup
- Have one member of your party man the Frost cannon
- Attack the Patriarch
- Kill any spawned Oozes
- Profit????
Another great writeup, thank you. Some more tips:
In the room of pits, the left and right chain spikers have 2 chains each, and they can run back and forth between the 2 chains to cause more dmg. The middle guy just has the one chain, as you say. Also, having the 2 tankers run around in opposite circles seems to help (clockwise & counter-clockwise).
Isn't the room of pits event over when the graveling boss dies? Once that's dead, the spikes no longer do any dmg to the other gravelings, so either ignore them and grab the chest (as mentioned above) or kill them normally and proceed onwards.
Whilst protecting Detha, I always kill the necros first, as their conditions are horrible. The kill order is then the same as yours.

How Jazz Music Can Make You a Better Guitarist
(by guest blogger Chris Huff at Behind the Mixer)
Jazz music, specifically instrumental jazz, forces the listener to focus on the instruments and the arrangement. You can’t get lost singing along. Jazz brings all the instruments to the forefront and it’s there where you will learn a lot.
Great jazz musicians know how to play off each other, how to play behind the other instruments, how have the right sound for their instrument, and how they sound along with the other instruments.
Electric guitarists (that means YOU), have spent a lot of time and energy finding that perfect tone you love to hear from your guitar. It might even be song-specific. But there are two questions I have to ask you; 1) did you set your tone based off what you heard on the stage or from the house speakers? 2) did you ever check that tone against the other instruments?
There is a lot your sound guy can do for shaping your sound and the sound of the band. HOWEVER, the best modifications are made first at the instrument level. Welcome to some extra time in the church sanctuary.
The five steps to a better sounding electric guitar tone;
1. Arrange time with your sound guy to work in the sanctuary when it’s not in use.
2. Set up your equipment in the middle of the sanctuary. Connect to the audio system with the help of the sound tech.
3. Play and listen to how it sounds from the house speakers.
4. Tweak your settings (guitar, effects, amp).
5. Play and repeat step number 4 until you find the best sound.
You’ll find that great tone you thought you had on the stage sounds different in the sanctuary.
Now that you’ve got that great tone, how does it sound against the other instruments?
I’m not saying you have to drag the whole band to the sanctuary. What I am saying is there are specific instruments you should work with during your practices to create the best complimentary sounds. Specifically, the bass player and the keyboard player. The two instruments can fight for audio frequencies that you share and if there is more fighting and too much sharing, your instruments will sound like mud.
For example, a keyboardist playing pads can really fill out the sound of a band. But if the pad sound sounds so much like the electric guitar effects, then the sounds blur together. The sound guy can tweak the frequencies to a limited extent but when the two instruments are so similar in frequency / sound, then the mix (your sound as a band) will suffer.
Therefore, the next time you are practicing with the band, spend some time with the bassist and the keyboardist one-on-one so that you have all found the best patches and effects that prompt the great sound of your respective instruments while also making room for the other instruments in the mix.
What Type of Tomato Are You?
Odd question, definitely, but follow me on this point. The sound tech is like a cook. I can take all the ingredients and create a pot of chili. The success of the chili, however, is based largely on the quality of ingredients I use. Rotten tomatoes, dried out beans, spoiled meat…are these ingredients you’d want to make a pot of chili? View your sound as an ingredient and you’ll find yourself striving to be vine-ripened. And if you want to know what it sounds like to have instruments that make a great pot of chili, look to jazz.
–Chris Huff.
(Ready to learn and laugh? Chris Huff writes about the world of church audio at Behind The Mixer. He covers everything from audio fundamentals to improving instrument sounds. He can even tell you the signs the sound guy is having a mental breakdown.)

Typical ost from a “sound guy”. In all seriousness, great post. Us guitarists need to start thinking as part of the band with our tone and not just our playing. It’s all fine to say “let’s create space” or, “use layers” or, “other cliche worship guitarist line”, but if our tone doesn’t work with the other musicians, it’s all useless.
Thanks Samuel. I should have mentioned in the article that I play guitar – used to play on a worship team or two or three. It came down to always being on the stage or in the sound booth on Sunday so I picked one so I could spend the rest of the time worshiping with my family. So I’m not saying anything that I haven’t lived.
good points. but i think choice of notes and dynamics are more important than tone. don’t get me wrong, tone is important … but that should be up to the soundguy to figure out the best way to mix on the board via EQ. of course it helps if the source tones are already EQ’ed properly
I really like some of your suggestions. Our keyboard player just recently started experimenting with pads and I think we need to spend some one on one time figuring out how we interact with each other. Especially with her being new to it.
I usually work with the sound guy to get my tone to a place where it melds well. We keep the amps in a back room which I have found helps me understand how I sound to everyone else. Usually if there is an EQ issue we try to fix it on the amp first and only use the eq on the board for quick fixes during a set.
Don’t forget Piano as well. But I agree choice of notes / chords shapes and dyanmics are more important. A good rhythm session also helps.
Notes and chord shapes are definitely important! I had to draw a line somewhere in the article and that was it.
You don’t want your sound guy yelling out “Try that with a G Dim7th instead!”
fwiw, the article was good and you made your points clear about tone … and soundguy yelling the progression would really be something
Hey thanks for the suggestions, I just might do that middle of the sanctuary thing. Unfortunately guitarists like other fanatics on this planet are a bit irrational at times, and we don’t want to even consider the possibility of our sound being sculpted better at any other source than our amp. Maybe because we spent a pretty dollar on it? Maybe because the house speakers can’t match the perfect ones inside our cabinet? Haha insert any other slightly ridiculous reason here.
But every Sunday, it does travel beyond that point, so it’s good to know what it sounds like further down the line. I’ll say it’s transmitted, not replicated, so as not to injure the source *pats amp*. I’ve listened to CD’s of our worship service but I can’t remember how our sound guy records it–if it records the straight in sound before he mixes it or if it records the mix he lays down. Anyway, I am interested in how it sounds to the audience, with the best way hearing it with other instruments.
And on the jazz, playing with other musicians always helps. I’m always impressed by a musician who can meld well.
Hearing your self form the middle of the sanctuary is a great idea. I recently got myself a wireless unit for my guitar and was actually able to stand out in the seats for a few songs during a Sunday am run-through (we’re a portable church meeting in a school’s caf-a-gym-a-torium so Sunday am is the only time I get to hear the main system) and it was really useful hearing myself in that context.
The other option if you can’t get to the middle of the auditorium is to place a recording souce there. I have a little flash based recorder, the zoom something or other, and it is GREAT about showing flaws and successes in performance.
The other thing to consider as well is that sound changes once you got a bunch of people in there, so all that time you spent perfecting your tone is going to have to change again.. ah well.
Thanks for the great post.
What’s the best option for using an amp to get good tone through the house? Direct out through the speaker out or with a dynamic SM58 offcenter?
@BenG – Between the two options? I tend to go with offcenter. Direct out can work but I like capturing that true “from the speaker” sound.
Hi there Chris! Thanks so much for this post, very helpful. As a guitar player I really struggle with finding good tones. There’s so many variables from cords, pickups and amps to pedals, mics and mic placement that it’s a really hard thing for me to find good tones, especially distorted or overdriven tones. Gonna see if I can really get some time to focus on getting a good tone for all applications within the church. Thanks for the tips, and I really love your site!

Computex 2008 - Day 1
In the beginning there was .. rain, lot's of it!
Hey everyone and welcome to the the first real article from the show floors at the opening day of Computex here in Taiwan. The Computex started with a bit of a rumble as there was a bit of an Earthquake two days ago. It scaled 6 on the Richter scale, and appearantly here in Taipei it was quite noticeable. Nothing went really wrong and .. well I don't think anyone even cares here, in what is easily one of the most populated cities in the world.
Anyway, as good as things are organized inside the buidlings, outside it's a tad more depressing. The rain season started and it pretty much rains here all day, combined the humidity and temperatures make it a 'special' experience. That does make some very nice photo's though.
None the less, Computex ... today TAITRA officially opened the Computex with a press conference. Guru3D quickly attended as well.
Of course on openings day some dancing girls can't be left out. Before you start emailing us, yes! Loads and loads of nice looking booth-babes. Once I return from Taipei later this week I will finalize such articles as Internet access over here is pretty bad, and we do have loads and loads of photo's to cover and process.
But with that being said, let's enter the exhibition floors, we'll start at the 4th floor of the Nangang facility. Since Point of View sponsors our Computex stay, I figured it would only be fair to start with them. Head on over to the next page please where we will start covering the booths.

DULUTH - Three Duluth residents are vying for a vacant seat on the Duluth City Council.Billy Jones, George Rhode and Elise Whitworth are running for Council Post 3, a seat being vacated by retiring Councilman Jim Hall. All three candidates agree the struggling economy is a big challenge the council will have to face. Jones, who served on the Citizens' Budget Committee, said he knows how hard it was for the city to balance the fiscal year 2010 budget. "I know FY '11 will be just as hard, if not harder," he said. The lifelong Duluth resident has been active in the community for years, volunteering for the annual Duluth Fall Festival and serving on the city's Parks and Recreation Advisory Board. He also filled an unexpired term on the City Council in 1992. "I decided to step it up a notch," he said on why he decided to run for the council. "I have five generations living in the city limits. I have a very vested interest in the city and its future." As the economy recovers, Jones said the council needs to have a prioritized plan to address the city's infrastructure needs and improve the roads and parks. Rhode, who has lived in Duluth for 28 years, has also been active in the community, serving in several civic organizations and as chairman of the Duluth City Alcohol Review Board. "I decided it was time to step forward to the front line," he said. "I feel like I could bring a new perspective and energy to the City Council." If elected, Rhode said he will work with employees to learn as much as possible about city operations. He wants to tackle economic redevelopment projects, such as revitalizing the Buford Highway corridor, and build a senior activity building at W.P. Jones Park. As for redeveloping the old City Hall block, Rhode said some parts of some of the buildings must be torn down. "I'd like to see as much saved as possible because it's part of the character of the city," he said. Whitworth, a longtime Gwinnett County resident who moved to Duluth more than two years ago, said the city's major challenges are aging infrastructure, economic decline and job loss, and overdevelopment of retail space. She said she wants to serve as a catalyst for increased job opportunities, sustainable economic growth, improving infrastructure, crime prevention, increasing sidewalks, walking and biking trails, preserving Duluth's historical heritage and hometown character, and advancing the fine arts. "I am concerned about the direction our country is taking and the impact it has on our local citizens and economy," she said. "I want to be an active part of the solution and serve as an advocate for Duluth families and businesses, preserving and advancing core values of faith, family, and flag." Incumbents Marsha Anderson Bomar and Jim Dugan are running unopposed. SideBar: Post 3 Post 3 · Billy Jones · Age: 50 · Education: Some college · Occupation: Project manager at Cisco · Political experience: Filled an unexpired term on the City Council in 1992 · Family: Divorced; children David, 28, and Dana, 23, granddaughter Madison, 2 · If Elected: With five generations of family living in Duluth, Jones said he'll bring a unique perspective on the history and needs of the city. "No other candidate has that connection," he said. · Elise Whitworth · Age: 61 · Education: Bachelor's in psychology from Medical University of the Americas, master's in adult education from the University of Georgia and master's in divinity from Emory University · Occupation: Online faculty with Axia College of the University of Phoenix · Political Experience: Appointed to Duluth Ethics Board in 2009 · Family: Single · If elected: "I will facilitate increased job opportunities, improved infrastructure, crime prevention, multi-generational planning, sustainable growth and preservation of our historical heritage and hometown character." · George Rhode · Age: 60 · Education: Bachelor's in business administration from Southern Illinois University and graduate work in hospital and rehabilitation administration · Occupation: Retired from U.S. Army · Family: Single · If Elected: "I plan to work closely on the Buford Highway redevelopment (and the) 'Old City Hall' block and secure funding to build a senior activity building."

DORAVILLE -- Firefighters from Gwinnett and DeKalb counties helped contain an ammonia leak at a Doraville refrigeration facility Monday night.
Gwinnett County firefighters and the department's Hazmat team responded to Nordic Cold Storage on the 4300 block of Pleasantdale Road at about 8:15 p.m., finding the business already evacuated, spokesman Capt. Tommy Rutledge said.
Calling in DeKalb County's Hazmat crew as backup at the scene near the Gwinnett-DeKalb line, firefighters donned special suits and carried monitors as they entered the building to find the leak coming from a "pump packing valve," Rutledge said.
Employees at the 24-hour operation were already outside the business when emergency personnel arrived. They worked with a crew from Nordic Cold Storage in order to locate the leak, Rutledge said.
"Firefighters from the Hazmat team said that the safety systems in place seemed to have functioned as designed in isolating the leak," Rutledge said.
Anhydrous ammonia is often used as a refrigerant in large-area cold storage facilities, Rutledge said.
"It is a high irritant to skin and the respiratory system," Rutledge said. "It can be very hazardous if you're exposed to it or breathe it in, but, again, it was isolated to the building itself in a particular area."
The leak was under control by about 10 p.m.

There's nothing like a night out to pick up your spirits. And when it's National Night Out, it also sends the message that everyone in the community is of the same spirit when it comes to fighting crime.. Lilburn was one of them.
This year, under the leadership of SafetySmart Lilburn President Margot Ashley, residents will gather once more to show their support for their community.
"(National Night Out) is designed to send a message to criminals letting them know neighborhoods are organized and fighting back," Vice-President Teresa Czyz said.
And it's not just about a few volunteers putting up posters for a party.
"Gwinnett Police Department offers community building organization to subdivisions that garner 65 percent participation. Three initial meetings are led by Eric Rooks, followed by yearly meetings," Czyz said, noting that NNO provides a good opportunity for people to get out and connect with each another.
But let's get back to this big night out. The organization has gathered more than 50 sponsors so far for the Aug. 7 event at Lilburn City Park. Many local restaurants are donating food and drinks. Entertainment will include music, cookie decorating, police K-9 demonstrations and a chance to see the latest firefighting technology up close.
The activities will take place from 6 to 8:30 p.m. But it doesn't stop there. After the main event, the celebration goes on. And even those who are unable to attend NNO in the park still have the chance to participate by "Lighting Up Lilburn."
"This year, SafetySmart Lilburn wants everyone in the entire Greater Lilburn area to participate. And it's easy. All you have to do is turn on an outside light or porch light from 8 to 10 p.m." Czyz said.
Participation in NNO can be as simple as that. It does not have to be a major event in order to be included in the national statistics. Registration information and ideas are available at
Norcross will be participating in its first NNO from 4 to 9 p.m. in Thrasher Park, tying in with the community spirit of the Whistle Stop Farmers Market which conveniently runs at the same time.
Registration is still open, and I repeat, this does not have to be complicated. With all the online communication we have available it should be easy enough for every community in the county to get the word out. And how cool it would be to support every policeman in the county by following that familiar advertising slogan of "We'll leave the light on for you."

The GYROTONIC EXPANSION SYSTEM has completely transformed the way I understand my pitching delivery and how I prepare for each outing during the baseball season. GYROTONIC and GYROKINESIS exercises have improved my body sensitivity and awareness through the introduction of certain concepts such as circular movement, spirals, kinetic chains, spinal health and mobility, hip and shoulder joint health and suppleness, and energetic pathways. It's a way of taking care of my body by opening up the spine and improving the quality of movements in space, on the baseball field, and in life. By opening up pathways in my body, both GYROTONIC and GYROKINESIS practice help my actions and reactions in baseball to be quicker, smoother, and completely under control. Ultimately, both of these modalities allow me to enjoy the game in more depth, which is why I keep doing it.

One of the reasons to hope that the effort to re-invigorate American political history succeeds is the flow-on effect such a revival might have for the development of studies of the American state. The changing role of government, especially the central government, and the relationship of the citizenry to that state should be major themes in the study of American history, but this is not the case. Yet the role of the state is at the heart of an essential difference between today's, no less than yesterday's, political parties. Many scholars suspect that the growth of bureaucracy has had important consequences for the downturn in voter participation, just as the lateness of the growth of the state in the United States helps explain some of the most important and enduring differences between the United States and other Western nations. Certainly the comparative theme in American history would be stronger than it presently is if there were a broader history of the American state. And finally, at a time when everywhere in the West the state appears to be shrinking (though hardly withering away), it is interesting to ask about the earlier circumstances which led to the growth of state activity. One of the interesting claims to emerge from Canadian studies of the state is the notion that governmental roles grew in response to increasing levels of international trade in order to provide a new level of protection for the citizenry against the vagaries of the international economic order. If we understood the growth of the state in those terms, we might be even more alarmed by the sudden decline of state activity at the very time that global economic interdependency reaches new heights. The state and the growth of the state are rich historical themes with broad integrative powers. Moreover, a long run historical perspective on the rise and relative decline of state activity is the best means by which we can evaluate the changes of the moment.
Ballard Campbell's book is a helpful step in each of these respects. The focus here is on the growth of U.S. government, and he means essentially the government in Washington, from the late 1880s to more or less the present. Campbell argues that a fundamental shift in the scope of state activity occurred in the late 1880s with the Cleveland Administration effectively separating a past in which the central government performed few functions from the modern era of a vast and activist state. But of course the actual process of change has been more gradual, both in the development of state activity and in the seeming retreat of government in the modern era. Campbell sees the shift as involving four stages of civic expansion.
The first, the longest period, stretched from federation to the 1870s. The "Republican Polity" reflected the traditional view--the Revolutionary fear--of governmental power. Government performed few functions, had limited revenue which it derived largely from indirect rather than direct taxes. Government, certainly at the federal level, was small because a wider range of functions was deemed dangerous to notions of republican virtue. The fact that the national government had access only to indirect taxes constituted a powerful limitation on any wish to expand the governmental role. Locally based property taxes were important, but closely watched and always contested. Citizen involvement was high in the absence of a direct governmental bureaucratic role simply because reliance on temporarily commissioned citizens was the only means by which important public functions, particularly road building and school construction, could happen.
The "Transitional Polity," from the 1880s to the 1920s, saw an increasing level of governmental regulation and higher indirect taxes. The Interstate Commerce Commission serves as the quiescent transitional agency. Campbell sees Cleveland's 1886 "State of the Union" address as a clear departure from so much of the "small government" thought which had preceded it, especially in Cleveland's call for relief for those financially destroyed by the collapse of the Freedman's Bank and in his call for a pension bill for all Civil War veterans in preference to the previous policy of individual claimants. And of course there was the ISCC. Campbell provides telling reminders of this smallness of government against which one must set these innovations--the governor's office in Wisconsin which consisted of five people, including the janitor, and of Cleveland answering the White House telephone and on occasion the front door. But the changes came gradually, reflecting a "great debate," a rehearsal for that conclusively conducted in the New Deal era, about the proper role of government.
The incrementalism of the transition period is captured in the growth of the "on the ground" functions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In due course, the Department began radio broadcasting as well as purchasing of farm surplus. County Agents became features of virtually every county of the United States, and in many counties there was a female agent to address the problems rural women encountered. Government was indeed proving to be a solution to many problems.
No doubt the most controversial part of the book is the treatment of the "Claimant Polity," stretching from the 1930s to the 1970s. It is not difficult to demonstrate that this short period involved a categorical shift in the responsibilities of government, building on the Cleveland departure but involving new levels of activism at all levels of government and demonstrating as well a new capacity to marshal power. In part, this was made easier by Hoover who, in a re-statement of traditional views, Campbell sees as holding firmly to the older understanding of a limited governmental role, regardless of the circumstances. War was of course a more powerful impetus to expansion than even Depression. In the midst of WWII, federal government expenditure was ten times the highest level of the Depression era. This was possible only because direct taxation by the federal government became part of virtually all citizens' lives. Social welfare became a central responsibility of the federal government and direct taxes rose accordingly.
Why did government grow so fast? Campbell advances four explanations--genuine responses to industrialism and its consequent dislocations, pressure from interest groups seeking favors, voters who want and come to expect new levels of governmental programs, and finally government itself in seeking its own growth. Campbell's argument is that all of these are both interrelated and important. This is not the most compelling argument, though one cannot but agree that there is no "magic bullet," as Campbell says, to explain the growth of government. If the enormous expansion of the state for war and welfare are familiar themes, Campbell is very useful in denoting the price which underlay this expansion. Taxes were one issue, excessive levels of regulation was another; adding power to both objections was the perception, increasing since the Kennedy administration, that big government was slowing down positive change.
Enter the "Restrained Polity" perfectly represented by the Reagan and Bush, and Clinton, administrations. Government, Reagan said, was the problem, not the solution. Tax cuts and privitization became central issues of national political debate. Increasingly critics perceived that the state was behaving as some of the republicans of so long ago said it would--for the few at the expense of the many. But Campbell makes clear that while the language of the "Restrained Polity" may resemble that of the old republicans, in fact there has been a sea change. The old fear of central government which animated the republican ideology is gone or at least largely displaced. The state under Reagan, after all, expanded; it did not contract. Taxes were reduced and capped, which meant that government income slowed. But spending rose and debt grew enormously. Perhaps more importantly in terms of Campbell's developmental trajectory, there is no evidence that Reagan or his administration were as afraid or distrustful of government power as the true republicans were. The modern Republicans pushed harder to reduce taxes than they did to reduce spending. Military spending expanded enormously. The republican era is not upon us and will not return. Americans have come to accept large government.
In delivering this message, there are some inevitable problems. The most serious goes to the core of the book's purpose and market. Is this a textbook or a monograph? In one sense, the sheer vastness of the subject constantly pushes the book to high levels of generalization and treatment. Campbell accentuates this sense of a generalized account by providing too many formal definitions and thinly developed models from other areas. There are, for example, echoes of systems theory's feedback loops in the discussion of the explanation for the growth of government in the "Claimant Era." Some parts of the general story are familiar; a closer focus would provide the different perspective necessary to the re-telling. This is always a difficult matter to gauge but a lesser treatment of the familiar would leave more space for the specific. Even the most general sections would be improved with a clearer statement of how this book intersects with the standard works in the field. Campbell does not see his state as particularly "maternalist" in the fashion of Theda Skocpol. Nor does he emphasize the development of administrative capacity to the degree that this dominated the earlier work of Stephen Skowronek, though the ability to marshal power and act directly upon the citizenry are central points in Campbell's argument. This book places greater emphasis on tax and revenue flow than either of the above, and it would be useful to draw out more fully the differences and convergences in at least these three quite different approaches to the history of state development in the United States.
Second, the aspect of the book which most effectively served as a counterpoint to the excessively generalized account of the ebb and flow of federal power is the use of two case studies--Arlington, Massachusetts, and Birmingham, Alabama--introduced here as exemplars of the impact these developments had on ordinary lives. This side by side treatment of the macro and micro levels of state development is a highly imaginative and potentially very successful aspect of the book's methodology. Unhappily, the process is not sustained, and the two case studies become less and less visible as the book proceeds. Now perhaps there is a message to be read into that trajectory, but if so it is not stated and one suspects that there in the end was just not room for the effort to trace national changes in any detail back to the local level. A dramatic alternative would have been alternating national and local chapters with the latter exploring the consequences of changes in the former. The gradual and unexplained weakening of the Arlington and Birmingham case studies reduces the book's effectiveness.
Third, in line with the above, the book would be stronger with a more sustained and systematic focus on governmental activity at the state and local levels. Campbell notes that state and local governments were "the workhorses of the republican polity" (p. 16). These governments were never "small," and certainly they always impacted on the citizenry; indeed state and local governments were for all intents and purposes the most important levels of government activity until the modern period. This in itself, of course, undermines a notion of all government as being "small" before the late nineteenth century. Local government, in the republican era, involved tremendous numbers of citizens, often in the form of independent boards and commissions, both with large and rapidly changing memberships. A philosophy of low taxation ensured that most of the activity of local government was in lieu of a bureaucracy. Functions--especially road building in rural areas--could only happen if it depended on citizen labor. Road districts were created and road taxes levied, but the expectation was that the tax would be acquitted by labor on the roads of each district. Reality and ideology were mutually reinforcing. All of this deserves a greater emphasis, even if only to help sustain the argument of the book positing a clear conceptual break between the traditional and modern worlds. Likewise, the older "commonwealth literature" on the state--largely ignored here--might have been usefully deployed. Our understanding of the earlier periods of state activity would be further enhanced if alongside the notions of republicanism there were also some attention to the legal philosophy prevailing which saw the purpose of government being the release of private energy. The book could have done more with the fact of the growth of bureaucracy and the implications of this growth for traditional republican notions of political engagement.
Fourth, there is little reflection here on the consequences and costs likely to be associated with the disappearance and/or privitization of state services. At one point Campbell notes that government grew "as a mechanism to reduce the risks of an unpredictable and sometimes harsh world" (p. 53). That point could be drawn out more carefully and used as a evaluative ground against which to consider the modernizing trends which seem to leave more and more citizens at the mercy of a newly deregulated world.
Against these complaints should be set the great virtues of this book. First it is a valuable step in the right direction. The state is a tremendously useful focus for political inquiry and one which, while common overseas, seems remarkably muted in the United States. The long term development tables in the book are marvelous; the effort in putting them together must have been enormous. They chart and summarize whole eras of state development, especially of the growth in federal government activity and costs. The Growth of Government certainly fills an important gap in charting exactly that. If the republican polity remains less fully discussed than might be the case, the discussion of the growth of government during the transition and New Deal eras is excellent. Campbell shows convincingly that government responsibilities at all levels, state and local as well as national, expanded enormously. In the aftermath of WWII, management of the economy became a federal government responsibility. Federal outlays were suddenly twice those of the most expansive year of Hoover's administration; federal debt went from 16 percent of GDP in 1929 to 46 percent in 1939. The "great debate" changed from a fixation over the degree of government power to a debate over the uses of governmental power.
Second, the book puts the complaint about government spending in a useful context. The U.S. remains, by European standards, a low tax nation, but taxes have gone up enormously in the period. Campbell notes that in Cleveland's era, most Americans were not paying any direct governmental tax at all; the Civil War experiment with income tax had collapsed under adverse court rulings and the 16th Amendment was yet thirty years in the distance. Only a minority of people directly paid property taxes because only a minority of people owned property.
When the income tax did come in 1913, only one percent of the workforce was eligible and the maximum rate was seven percent. By the end of WWII, however, two thirds of workers were paying income tax. Congress provided for these increasingly large taxes to be withheld, reducing the visibility of the tax bite, if not the pain. The surge in the flow of revenue to Washington was under way and would not slow for forty years; the federal government came to capture three quarters of all tax dollars. And, Campbell insists, revenue flow drove expenditure programs. Chapter Six on income security is outstanding in its own right and as an example of that process. Campbell reminds us that the federal government spends three times the amount on non-means tested insurance programs such as social security than it does on means tested programs. The former are virtually sacrosanct; the later are the red meat of political debate. The elderly universally receive social security; only a third of the poor receive welfare.
Third, the book traces the rise of executive government, beginning with the New Deal's focus on the presidency. Campbell emphasizes, however, that the same trend toward reliance and focus upon executive government is evident at all levels. In the "republican polity," the emphasis was on short political careers and short terms in office while the "Claimant Polity" helped keep bureaucrats and politicians in power for long periods. Congress responded in a telling way by creating its own retirement scheme in 1946. The republican era rested upon a largely passive executive--a "low-key stewardship"--whereas in the modern polity the executive has become the core of government and the presidency, "the dominant institution in the nation's civic life" (p. 209).
Finally Campbell shows how the worm turned, how government increasingly came to be seen as a problem rather than a solution to a problem. The first signs emerged in the Kennedy Administration with the argument that greater growth would be possible through curtailing taxes. A second shot was fired in the early 1970s in the increasingly vocal resistance to the vast regulatory system then in place. Campbell sees a rather Machiavellian aspect to this process. Money, he argues, became the lifeblood of the "Claimant Polity" and the most lucrative taxes were tied to the most popular spending programs. This explains why Reagan's presidency was decisive, but not in the ways we often think it was. No new ideology was put in place; the old republicanism did not re-emerge. Programs (some) grew and debt rose. But the flow of revenue changed dramatically. Reagan reduced taxes by 25 percent, reduced the tax brackets to three and, perhaps even more importantly, indexed the brackets for inflation while simultaneously launching a decisive war on inflation itself. The slowing of inflation and the indexing of bracket thresholds ended "bracket creep" with its painless flow of ever increasing levels of revenue to the central government. The expansionary state stopped expanding. Policy changed because the revenue flow, the lifeline of the "Claimant Polity," slowed. Campbell, it should be clear, is no fan of unrestrained government growth, which, as he notes, confuses responsibility and concentrates power while all the time building the claims for yet more revenue. The "Claimant Society" said that government should respond to needs and perceived needs; the problem was that it became increasingly difficult to obfuscate, to use Campbell's word, the true costs of special benefits.
This is a valuable book, broad in its scope and thus capable of charting over two centuries the expansion and contraction of governmental, especially federal government, activity in the United States. The costs and benefits of that expansion and contraction are judiciously stated. Campbell helps provide a sense of our own time in this large scale pattern. The Reagan presidency was important for the seriousness of its attack on at least some programs; while welfare was the easy target, even Social Security--hitherto sacrosanct--was curtailed in the most substantial changes in the life of the program. Yet the state was not cut back dramatically by Reagan, Bush or Clinton. Only the rate of increase has been slowed. The goals were limited--lower taxes and less welfare.
Far more important is the continuity in the ideas which Campbell sees as rising to ascendancy in the "Claimant Polity" and continuing into the "Restrained Polity." Today government is less feared and more trusted than it was in the past. There is a broad social consensus in favor of governmental programs to support education, to protect the environment, to conduct drug education programs and to protect the health of individual citizens. The powerful state, Campbell argues, is here to stay. Our time is a moment in the continuing great debate over the role of the state; the underlying consensus in favor of governmental action and the faith in the capacity of government to act positively will no doubt loom larger to future historians than the modest restraints on the growth of the state which recent years have seen. Campbell concludes that the present is best understood as continuing the long-standing debate between one set of values emphasizing the necessity of individuals to be free to flourish and another set which emphasizes the need for government to provide the security necessary for the flourishing of freedom. Campbell helps us understand why it is that the consensus of the moment revolves more around the latter proposition.:

Mofaz sets his sights high
A mistake or two by Netanyahu, such as his withdrawn ultimatum regarding the referendum over disengagement, is all that separates Shaul Mofaz from a victory in the next battle for the leadership of the Likud and the premiership.
It is possible that the next government, the disengagement government, which people mistakenly insist on calling a "unity government," will be the last government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. On the assumption that the new government is intact when it reaches the elections in November 2006, when the next Knesset completes its term, Sharon will be 82 years old. The prime minister himself generally says that he has taken it upon himself to disengage Israel from the Gaza Strip, and that he is leaving the challenge of the final status agreement to the next generation of leaders. The evacuation of a few thousand settlers from Gush Katif and from the northern part of the West Bank is only a preliminary to the withdrawal from most of the territory of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. After the disengagement plan pushed the Labor Party into the back seat, it is reasonable to assume that this important and difficult task will devolve partly on the next leader of the Likud.
The prevailing opinion in recent years is that anyone who doesn't want Sharon will get Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, according to public opinion polls, a mistake or two by Netanyahu, such as his withdrawn ultimatum regarding the referendum over disengagement, is all that separates Shaul Mofaz from a victory in the next battle for the leadership of the Likud and the premiership. On the eve of the last elections, the High Court of Justice managed to stop the general, who was in a rush to get into the Knesset, and forced him to make do with the cabinet. Now Mofaz is already a full-blown party activist. He has his own "camp," and his own "candle-lighting ceremony," and an emotional "Likud now and forever" speech. If everything goes as planned, next Rosh Hashanah he will already be inviting his friends to drink a toast at the Fair Grounds in Tel Aviv. Just like Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and Health Minister Danny Naveh.
When Major General (res.) Ami Ayalon, who became a civilian over four years ago, expressed interest in becoming prime minister, it was claimed that he was rushing from the army into politics. Lieutenant General (res.) Mofaz cooled off for barely one winter out of uniform before entering the Defense Ministry and registering for the Likud, and he is already storming the Prime Minister's Office and galloping ahead in the polls. It is difficult to understand why Mofaz is enjoying special treatment, and not only from the right wing. Why did Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon alone bear the criticism for the epidemic of harming innocent Palestinian citizens, the "confirmed killing," abuse of dead bodies and humiliation at the checkpoints?
Mofaz always remains untouched, as though the concept of "ministerial responsibility" has nothing to do with him. The defense minister is not called to account for the expansion of the outposts located within his area of jurisdiction, nor for the uprooting of thousands of olive trees and theft under the noses of Israel Defense Forces commanders. He didn't find it necessary to apologize for the scandalous planning of the route of the separation fence, which caused Israel a great deal of political and economic damage, and dealt a mortal wound to the fabric of life of thousands of Palestinians. According to his recorded whisper into Sharon's ears, had it been up to Mofaz, instead of force majeure quietly removing late Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat from the area, an IDF would have been sent to the Muqata, and the territories would have been burning.
Until it became clear that Sharon is determined to pass the disengagement plan, and that most of the public stands behind him, Defense Minister Mofaz openly opposed IDF withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Lieutenant General Mofaz did the same on the eve of the withdrawal from Lebanon, and at the height of the negotiations over the Camp David 2 accord, and the Clinton proposal. Regarding Mofaz's contribution to igniting the territories - Shlomo Ben-Ami, who was foreign minister at the time, wrote that then minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who coordinated the effort to achieve a cease-fire at the start of the intifada, expressed fury at the fact that the army under Mofaz's command "was conducting on the ground an entirely different war from the one ordered by the political echelon" ("A Front Without a Rearguard: Voyage to the Boundaries of the Peace Process," published in Hebrew by Yedioth Ahronoth).
Ben-Ami testifies that "the IDF operated in this crisis according to its own ideals ... which in the final analysis led to an expansion of the cycle of violence." The distorted image of a soft-spoken general among belligerent political activists is placing in the front ranks a person who sees the world through the gun sight - just when there is a special need for a statesman with broad horizons.

.
A tall, graying pilot in a U.S. Air Force uniform walked through the General Staff Building in Tel Aviv last month with a thoughtful, or maybe worried, expression on his face. This was Lt. Gen. Paul J. Selva, assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, following his meeting with a pilot in an Israel Air Force uniform, Maj. Gen. Amir Eshel, head of the army's Plans and Policy Directorate.
Selva is the Pentagon official who accompanies Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her trips abroad. He also has another role left over from the days of former secretary Condoleezza Rice and the Annapolis summit: He is the road map peace plan's kashrut supervisor.
The Obama administration's statement that the Annapolis understandings no longer obligate Israel has no real substance. At bottom, in Jerusalem as well as in Washington, there is continuity between administrations. Selva, like Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton, who is building up the Palestinian security forces, was held over from the previous administration to the current administration. If Israel wants former president George W. Bush's vague promise to former prime minister Ariel Sharon - that any Israeli-Palestinian deal will recognize "the new realities on the ground" - to obligate Bush's successor, President Barack Obama, then there must also be continuity from Sharon through former prime minister Ehud Olmert to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Interim agreements have always been considered nonbinding until there is a comprehensive agreement. The talks between Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, or between former foreign minister Tzipi Livni and former Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qurei, would not have obligated Livni, either, had she formed the current government. But practically speaking, national, organizational and personal memory form the basis for continued talks. There is no such thing as a clean slate. There are only slippery leaders.
Nor is Annapolis dead in a more profound sense. American policy has two stages: It starts with ana, which means "please" in Hebrew, and moves on to polis, which means "police" in Turkish. If polite urging does not suffice, we will glimpse the international policeman's baton - that of military, economic and diplomatic aid, and also that of the police force that hightails it out of the neighborhood when war breaks out between gangs who murder each other. A degree of isolationism, expressed in bumping Israel and its neighbors down on the list of international locales to which the White House gives its attention.
Fear of the impact of a failed diplomatic process led by America formed the background to both the talks with Egypt in 1977 and those with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993: Both began courtesy of a third party (Morocco, Norway), but were handed over to the Americans as a draft account when the time to close it arrived. Processes that begin with an American initiative - such as the talks with Syria, from the Madrid summit to Shepherdstown - have never succeeded, even if through no fault of the mediators.
The indirect talks between Netanyahu and Abbas, after nearly 17 years of direct talks between former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his successors on the Israeli side and Yasser Arafat and his successors on the Palestinian side, reflect a regression presented as progress. One must look not only at the talks' exterior casing, but rather at the ridiculous deal that ended with each side getting what it wants - Netanyahu the casing and Abbas what isn't inside it. The former will be able to say he talked, and the latter, that he has proved there is no one to talk to and nothing to discuss.
Israel's real problem is not with the Palestinians or the Syrians; its real problem is with itself: It has no self-definition. Israel has not yet decided what it wants to be when it is no longer so big. It is avoiding actions that accord with what is ostensibly its guiding idea - "to be a free nation in our land" - because it is still not clear on what our land is, who belongs to our nation and how concepts of freedom, independence and sovereignty should be implemented in an impossibly knotty world of dependency and reciprocal relations. Therefore, Israel's representatives conduct empty, conditional talks, on the implicit assumption that toward the end, they will have to go back to those who have sent them to receive the authorization without which the talks had no point to begin with.
Without an overarching idea, a vision from which to derive the moves that together make up a path, Israel is subject to endless turbulence, which is making it seasick. It has only political captains, who fear to lead and whose message is "both this and that." "Situation assessments" and "staff work" are the faded substitutes for statesmanship, leadership and winning the hearts and minds.
Prior to real proximity talks between Israel and itself, any contacts with any Arab party will become proximity fuses - detonators of bombs, landmines, booby traps or missile and rocket warheads, which cause explosions when the intended victim draws near.

On Saturday, the Year of the Dragon draws to a close. 新年快乐! In other equally important news, Purdue gets a shot at payback for the blowout loss they suffered in East Lansing last month. In addition to their eccentric chest-thumping techniques and hidden cameras, here are some highlights of the statistical profile the Spartans will be bringing into Mackey:
1 They haven't been quite as awesome as their record suggests.
Although they remain tied for first in the Big Ten, Michigan State has not exactly been dominant. With the exception of their blowout victory against us (yay!), all of their wins have been by fewer than 12 points. Compare this to Michigan, five of whose victories have been by more than 12.
Or look at the Spartans' conference efficiency margin. Good, but not great. More Naomi Watts than Scarlett Johanssen. (I'm talking hotness, not necessarily acting chops.)
This is not to disparage the Spartans. I'd be quite happy to wake up with either their record or their efficiency margin (or Naomi Watts for that matter). But the tempo-free perspective reminds us that Izzo's team is not quite the juggernaut that their conference record would suggest.
What to watch for: Do the Spartans come out looking like their record or their efficiency margin? The preview at The Only Colors included this interesting tidbit: During its last two games, MSU has shot 33% during the first half and 76% in the second. Their last two games have also been at home. If Purdue can hound them into another poor first half, perhaps momentum and the road environment can finally get them to wilt under pressure.
2 They're good at limiting opponents' scoring opportunities.
The Spartans are 3rd in the Big Ten at forcing turnovers. They do so on 19.1% of opponents' possessions. And when their opponents do get shots off, the Spartans collect most of the rebounds--71.3%, good for 2nd in the Big Ten. Now it just so happens that limiting turnovers and getting offensive rebounds are two of the (very small list of) things that Purdue doesn't suck at, so this will be an area where Boilermaker and Spartan strengths are in conflict. Dominating either category would be a big advantage for either team.
What to watch for: As far as rebounding goes, how big is our lineup? All of our bigs grab offensive boards at a decent rate, but they can't grab them if they're sitting on the bench. In the last game against MSU, Purdue's post players got 79 minutes. If that happens again, there's no excuse not to compete on the offensive glass.
As far as turnovers go, does Ronnie continue to value the ball like he has the last two games? Since finishing as co-champion of the impromptu turnover competition that broke out during the Indiana game, Ronnie has only surrendered the ball twice. But Michigan State is much better at forcing turnovers than either Northwestern or Penn State is. A third consecutive good performance today would be some solid evidence that young Ronnie has turned the corner as far as ball security goes.
3 They don't take very many threes.
For the conference season, about 27% of Michigan State's shots have been from distance, fewer than everyone in the Big Ten except for Purude and Ohio State. That may seem surprising since their threes killed us in East Lansing, but even in that game, fewer than 25% of the Spartans' shots were from behind the arc--the problem was that they hit over half of them. That and free throw shooting were the big difference in that first matchup.
What to watch for: Does Purdue tempt the Spartans from three? According to The Only Colors, Travis Trice is questionable for the game, while Gary Harris is likely to play but is not in great shape. Those two shoot over 40% from three, but without them, the team is right around 31%. Why not pack it in and try to keep Nix and Dawson from getting the ball while also keeping our bigs out of foul trouble?
Predictions:
Since I hadn't started doing these write-ups at the time of the first MSU game, I didn't have a good grasp of the Spartan's statistical profile. After looking at it, I felt happy because what I saw was a good but not great team--A team, moreover, who comes in battling injuries and has to play on the road. To me, that screams "toss-up game," whether the game's being held at the Bryce Jordan Mausoleum or the Kohl Center.
Aside from the
Indiana game Will Sheehey technical foul dress rehearsal, Purdue has been decent at home during conference play. In addition, the appearance of Stephen Toyra last game plus the extended minutes given to Donnie Hale gives me hope that Painter is ready to shake things up to get solid performances from whoever is ready on a given night.
So let's welcome the Year of the Snake with a surprise victory that gets us thinking NIT again and might even start those NCAA sugar plums dancing in dreamier heads. Am I stupid to predict a victory against a Top 10 team? Yes I am. Am I going to do it anyway? You betcha.
Purdue 66, Michigan State 63

Fast-paced, language-free video 5 minutes in length with 3 modules developed for training the why, when and how of hand washing. An excellent tool for motivating good hand hygiene behavior with existing and new employees. Format: NTSC DVD
“The Why” Segment Preview:
“The When” Segment Preview:
“The How” Segment Preview:
Excerpts from a review by John Lawn at FoodManagement Magazine:
“This new training video helps foodservice trainers address cross contamination issues in an effective, high-impact way.”
“It isn't often that you see a simple business tool that is nearly perfect for its job, but that's the feeling you get when you have your first viewing of Handwashingforife®:.”
“Packaged in three segments, each only 90 seconds long, the video is long on impact and short on words. It has no words at all, in fact, and instead focuses on communicating a universal message to those of even short attention spans or language barriers.”
“The visual impact comes from dramatic, special ‘glowing’ effects, first used to indicate hands contaminated by Norwalk virus, and then to show how quickly contamination can spread. from one employee to another, from utensils to food, and eventually directly to a finished plate served to a young child in a restaurant.”
“Let me say it again: this video sends a strong message that is very hard to ignore.”

The last of the 1,650 voters in the Falkland Islands have been casting their ballots in a referendum aimed at showing Argentina and the rest of the outside world that they are determined to remain a British overseas territory.
There are just 2,563 residents, but they have been doing all they can to show their sympathies, waving Union flags and dressing up their off-road vehicles.
Election observer Juan Henao said the process has been completely normal, and that more than 70% of the voters had cast their ballots by Monday afternoon. Polls were closing at 6pm local time (9pm GMT), and the results were expected to be announced later.
The ballot asks a simple yes-or-no question: "Do you wish the Falkland Islands to retain their current political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom?" Most islanders interviewed said they expect an overwhelming "Yes" vote. They were not given a choice in this ballot for any alternatives, such as full independence or some sort of political relationship with Argentina. The Falkland Islands Government said that in the hypothetical case of a majority for "no," they could explore alternatives in a second vote later.
The government barred from voting any visiting contractors or personnel from the sizeable British military deployment, as well as anyone who has. The islands' community, which includes families that have worked the land for nine generations, is steeped in British culture. has needed a large military garrison.
Argentina maintains that the islanders have no voice in a dispute that must be settled bilaterally, with Britain alone. The islanders hope the referendum will help them keep any deal off the table - and perhaps even persuade neutral nations such as the United States to come down on their side.
Two Falkland Islands MPs were already on their way to Washington, preparing to hand-deliver the results of an overwhelming "yes" vote to the US Congress. "Self-determination is what the United States was founded on and it is a fundamental right. It's a right that they recognise. So I would hope that they would listen to what's happening here today," said another member of the islands' legislative assembly, Dick Sawle.

Dear Editor,
Larry Rohter's assertion that former associates of Mr. Bishop "who was deposed and then killed by a faction within the New Jewel Movement..."merits closer scrutiny.(13 Years After Invasion, Grenada Agonizes Anew 5/21)
There was absolutely no evidence presented at the so called trial and conviction of Bernard Coard and other members of the Central Committee. Witnesses for the defense were prevented from testifying, cross examination was restricted according to U.S. and Jamaican attorneys who went to observe and consult with the defendants. The presiding justice admitted that the normal procedure with appeals to the Eastern Caribbean Judicial bench and thus a higher appeal to the Privy Council in London would be denied.
In a booklet brought back by attorneys entitled The Side You Haven't Heard; Bernard Coard Speaks to the Court in Grenada (August 1986) Coard presents documentation of the close comradely relations between Bishop and himself to the very end. Decisions of the Central Committee provided for separate responsibilities of the two leaders. At a Central Committee meeting just prior to the invasion and Bishop's house arrest, Bishop conceded that he had failed to implement the resolutions that were then adopted by the full Committee.
Given the history of infiltration, destabilisation, military force and cooptation, by the U.S. in the region and the stated policy of preventing "another Cuban model", a scenario of assasination by other members of the New Jewel Movement's leadership should be reexamined.
Sincerely,
David Silver

"Don't blame us!" was the theme of a Facebook court filing submitted Friday in response to lawsuits that shareholders filed after the company's disastrous IPO.
More than 40 lawsuits in different state and federal courts have been filed in the weeks since Facebook went public on May 18.
The offering was plagued with problems. On day one, a "technical error" on the Nasdaq exchange led to delays and errors in Facebook trades. Later, allegations surfaced that Facebook disclosed certain financial information in advance to analysts for big banks and not to average investors.
Friday's filing was Facebook's first response to the lawsuits, which the company wants consolidated into one case in a New York court.
Facebook used the filing to preview its defense, blaming Nasdaq for the trading issues that marred its debut day. It also admitted to having private conversations with analysts, but insisted it "followed customary practices" and didn't disclose anything improper.
First, the company tackled the Nasdaq meltdown.
'Shock and awe': Problems with Nasdaq's software systems made a hash of Facebook's first few trading hours, leaving many buyers in the dark about what they had bought and at what price they scored shares.
Those problems "created market uncertainty and caused investor losses," Facebook said in its court filing. It pointed to the the mea culpa Nasdaq issued, and quoted a smattering of press articles spotlighting the role Nasdaq's errors played in Facebook's share-price drop following its IPO.
"The head of NASDAQ's trading operations reportedly responded with 'shock and awe' over a mess out of his control," Facebook wrote, citing a Wall Street Journal article.
A Nasdaq spokesman declined to comment. Facebook's representatives declined to elaborate on the statements made in the company's court filing.
'Selective disclosure': disclose -- in less specific ways -- in a publicly available amendment to its IPO paperwork.
Facebook admitted in its court filing to having "follow-up conversations" with analysts from the banks underwriting its offering. Those analysts, according to the plaintiffs, then "discussed their forward-looking forecasts with certain institutional investors."
Even if they did, nothing illegal happened, according to Facebook.
"[Plaintiffs] ignore that what Facebook and the Underwriter Defendants allegedly did both followed customary practices and did not violate any rules," the company said in its filing.
Similarly, Morgan Stanley has insisted that it followed "the same procedures for the Facebook offering that it follows for all IPOs."
Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman elaborated on that theme in a CNBC interview last month.
"There was no nefarious activity. There wasn't any desire to obfuscate or hide [information]," Gorman said during that interview. He also acknowledged that several regulatory bodies are looking into the allegations.

Higher order function
From HaskellWiki
(Difference between revisions)
Revision as of 20:47, 9 March 2007
1 Definition
A higher order function is a function that takes other functions as arguments.
2 Discussion
The major use is to abstract common behaviour into one place.
2.1 Examples
2.1.1 In the librariesMany functions in the libraries are higher order. The (probably) most commonly given examples are
and
map
. Two other common ones are
fold
. A possible implementation of the them is:
curry, uncurry
curry :: ((a,b)->c) -> a->b->c curry f a b = f (a,b) uncurry :: (a->b->c) -> ((a,b)->c) uncurry f (a,b)= f a b
's first argument must be a function which accepts a pair. It applies that function to its next two arguments.
curry
is the inverse of
uncurry
. Its first argument must be a function taking two values.
curry
then applies that function to the components of the pair which is the second argument.
uncurry
3 See also
Accumulator recursion where the accumulator is a higher order function is one interesting case of continuation passing style.

Prime numbers
From HaskellWiki
1 Simple Prime Sieve
The following is an elegant (and highly inefficient) (factorize n) primeFactors 1 = [] primeFactors n = go n primes where go n ps@(p:pt) | p*p > n = [n] | x `rem` p == 0 = p : go (n `quot` p) ps | otherwise = go n pt
2 Simple Prime Sieve II
primes :: [Integer] primes = 2:filter isPrime [3,5..] where isPrime n = all (not . divides n) $ takeWhile (\p -> p*p <= n) primes divides n p = n `mod` p == 0
3 Prime Wheels
Notice in the above Prime Sieve II, only odd numbers are tested, because we know that all the even numbers (greater than 2) are composite. In effect, odd numbers, and not even numbers, are candidates for primality testing.
A prime wheel is a scheme to generate candidate numbers that are "pre-screened" so that they don't have certain predetermined divisors. For example, suppose we want candidates that are neither even nor divisible by 3. In that case, we need numbers of the form 6n + {1,5}.
primes :: [Integer] primes = 2:3:5:filter isPrime wheel where -- these numbers are automatically not divisible by 2 or 3 wheel = 7:11:map (6+) wheel -- don't bother to check for divisibility by 2 or 3 ps = drop 2 primes isPrime n = all (not . divides n) $ takeWhile (\p -> p*p <= n) ps divides n p = n `mod` p == 0
This generator runs slightly faster than Prime Sieve II above because it doesn't bother to perform prime testing on multiples of 2 or 3.
Here is why the scheme is called a prime wheel. Imagine that you had a wheel of circumference 6, and you are rolling that wheel along the number line. The wheel is marked along the edges to automatically tell you which numbers are candidates and which numbers to exclude. Specifically, multiples of 2, 3 or 6 are excluded, while numbers of the form 6n+1 and 6n+5 are candidates.
We can go further and exclude multiples of 5. To exclude multiples of 2, 3, and 5, our wheel has to increase in multiples of 30.
primes :: [Integer] primes = 2:3:5:7:11:13:17:19:23:29:filter isPrime wheel where -- these numbers are automatically not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 wheel = 31:37:41:43:47:49:53:59:map (30+) wheel -- don't bother to check for divisibility by 2, 3, or 5 ps = drop 3 primes isPrime n = all (not . divides n) $ takeWhile (\p -> p*p <= n) ps divides n p = n `mod` p == 0
This generator runs slightly faster than the (2,3) prime wheel because it doesn't bother to check multiples of 2, 3, or 5.
We can go even further and exclude multiples of 7, but this requires a much bigger wheel, and it provides only a very small additional speed-up. This wheel has a length of 210, and at this point we are probably well beyond the point of diminishing returns.
primes :: [Integer] primes = initPrimes ++ filter isPrime wheel where initPrimes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47, 53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97, 101,103,107,109,113,127,131,137,139,149, 151,157,163,167,173,179,181,191,193,197,199] -- the following numbers are automatically not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 wheel = [211,221,223,227,229,233,239,241,247,251,253,257,263,269, 271,277,281,283,289,293,299,307,311,313,317,319,323,331, 337,341,347,349,353,359,361,367,373,377,379,383,389,391, 397,401,403,407,409,419] ++ map (210+) wheel -- don't bother to check for divisibility by 2, 3, 5, or 7 ps = drop 4 primes isPrime n = all (not . divides n) $ takeWhile (\p -> p*p <= n) ps divides n p = n `mod` p ==)

#187: Paths_pkgname module is hard to use in a library ------------------------------+--------------------------------------------- Reporter: duncan | Owner: Type: defect | Status: new Priority: normal | Milestone: Component: Cabal | Version: 1.2.2.0 Severity: normal | Keywords: Difficulty: easy (<4 hours) | Ghcversion: 6.8.1 Platform: Linux | ------------------------------+--------------------------------------------- Most users of the auto-generated {{{Paths_pkgname}}} module are programs. With GHC at least they can get away with not specifying the {{{Paths_pkgname}}} in the {{{Other-Modules}}} field. Get away with in the sense that it does not lead to linker errors because {{{ghc --make}}} does dependency chasing and links in all the necessary .o files. However for a library you must specify every module in {{{Exposed- Modules}}} or {{{Other-Modules}}} or one does get linker errors when you try to use the packages. That's because the missing module's .o files will not have been included in the library .a archive. See bug #128. So for a library one must specify {{{Other-Modules: Paths_pkgname}}} but then of course Cabal cannot find that module since it is not in the normal source directories but in {{{dist/build/autogen}}}. So people have to hack around it by adding {{{dist/build/autogen}}} to the {{{Hs-Source-Dirs}}} field. Obviously that's rather unsatisfactory. Probably the right solution is for Cabal to automatically add that directory to the end of the source dir search path. -- Ticket URL: <> Hackage <> Hackage: Cabal and related projects

Wayne Batten who has been training Henry Castle for the past six fights believes that his man is maturing at 30 and is more than ready to step up to challenge for the big belts. Castle has somehow missed out on the opportunity to challenge for the major titles, but not now. His British Lightweight eliminator against Gary Buckland in Newport this Friday is the perfect opportunity for him to put that right according to his trainer..

WEDNESDAY, Sept. 12 (HealthDay News) -- Listeria-linked illness affecting 14 people in 11 states and the District of Columbia -- including three fatalities -- have prompted the recall of an imported ricotta salata cheese, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on its website Tuesday.
On Monday, "Forever Cheese, Inc., voluntarily recalled one lot of Frescolina brand ricotta salata cheese due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination," the CDC said.
Listeriosis is a sometimes severe foodborne bacterial illness. According to the CDC, local, state and federal investigations have pinpointed the Frescolina cheese as the likely source of the outbreak, and 12 of the 14 people who fell ill say they consumed a soft cheese prior to becoming sick. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also identified the outbreak strain of Listeria in a sample of uncut Frescolina cheese, the CDC said.
Ricotta salata is a salty, dry, crumbly cheese, not the soft ricotta used in most lasagna. and Aug. 9, the FDA said.
The recalled packages carry lot number T9425 and/or production code 441202, according to the FDA.
Anyone who bought recalled Frescolina ricotta salata cheese should discard any remaining cheese and not eat it. This is especially important for pregnant women, those with a weakened immune system, and older adults. When in doubt, throw it out.
So far, three cases have been reported in Maryland and one case each from California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The CDC said three cases ended in deaths in Minnesota, Nebraska and New York. Listeriosis is thought to have contributed to the deaths in Nebraska and New York but not to the death in Minnesota..

The Sony Open is in full swing but to get it going it takes an army of volunteers. There are volunteers from all over coming to Oahu for the tournament.
"They are coming from Minnesota, from South Carolina, they are coming from Alabama, from Florida," said Dean Scheid, Tournament Vice President. "And we have a group of 13 woman and they have been here for 20 years."
1700 volunteers are registered to help out in the Sony Open from ground control, hospitality, registration, admissions and score-keeping.
"We both are golfers," said Gerhard Frohlich, a volunteer. "We enjoy to golf."
There are 1300 volunteers alone in ground operations that are spread over 21 committees. Some make it a tradition to come every year as a way to give back to the community.
"This tournament is for the 'Benefit of Friends of Hawaii,' and so since we are both retired we enjoy volunteering for various organizations," said Frohlich who lives in Hawaii and who has been volunteering for the last 6 years.
'Friends of Hawaii Charities,' as you are well aware, we have given away over 12 million dollars with the 15 years that the Sony Open has been involved, so it is a great event and cause to be a part of," said Scheid.

The Hawaii House of Representatives unanimously passed HB154 HD2, to establish an industrial hemp research pilot program.
The bill now goes to the Senate.
A primary focus of the research is phytoremediation, the process by which the hemp plant draws toxins out of the soil and processes them safely through its roots, stalk, branches, and leaves.
House lawmakers expanded the scope of the research to include industrial hemp's value as a biofuel feedstock in Hawaii.
."
"Adding industrial hemp as a source of biofuel is another avenue worth pursuing," Thielen said. "Reducing our dependence on foreign oil through the use of a renewable resource would be very good for Hawaii."
The bill was introduced by Thielen, Speaker Joseph Souki, Representative Derek Kawakami, Representative Sylvia Luke, and Representative Angus McKelvey.

Big Wednesday ticket sold in Hastings
The $15million Big Wednesday was sold in Hastings at Caltex Station on Karamu Rd.
the Caltex Station also sold the second division-winning ticket - presumably to the same person.
Lotto spokeswoman Victoria Barton-Chapple said it had been an exciting run, as the jackpot had been rolling over since September 12, when a Tauranga man in his twenties won $27 million.
Ms Barton-Chapple said interest had become increasingly high as the jackpot grew.
"It's been running for a long time and we've just been waiting and waiting for it to go and tonight it's finally happened," she said.
"Obviously we don't know at this stage whether the winner is a local or someone passing through - it could be someone on holiday."
The jackpot is one of the biggest to be won by a single Big Wednesday winner in recent years.

That is why I got one of these instead, it come out perfect every time. I know it is not a real thing but I don't have time in the morning to get it right I can't leave the house without coffee.

For those that were interested in my binaural dummy head, i have posted my first recording with more, full length recordings coming soon.
I've never known superautos to ever make coffee resembling anything close to "perfect," though they are certainly at least somewhat consistent
Honestly not too sure. It's still in the wrapper. Bought it based on review, priced, and it being a face-balanced putter... which supposedly are better for less experienced/skilled individual like myself... who haven't really played in over 8 years.
Very nice clubs! What made you decide on the Nike irons instead of the Callaway's? I don't normally think of Nike for cavity back irons - for pro forged irons, absolutely - but I've been out of the market for quite a while, so all the high-tech golf gear looks pretty wild to me!
Based on review, price, and it supposedly being a good set for mid to high handicappers.
Now if only I can get some free time to test them out...

TTVJ- Slim AMP/DAC- Great Condition
Will Ship To: Anywhere
Hello,
Im selling my TTVJ Slim AMP/DAC that I currently use in my office. Its a great unit and I actually just recieved it back from Todd/Pete who upgraded the firmware and made sure the unit was in pefect working condition, so this is almost as good as new.
I'm selling only to fund an upgrade for a desktop amp (looking for Apex Peak if you are intersted in a trade plus cash from me) and the sound is amazing when paired with a simple iphone and my JH13's.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Price inculdes regular USPS shipping CONUS, but does not icluded PP fee's so add the % if you dont want to gift. Lastly, I will ship anywhere, but we will need to discuss shipping increase and increase in customs, etc. I rather stay USPS if possible.
Im not in a rush, so ridiculous lowball offers will be kindly ignored.
Cheers.

Hello all,
I recently bought a DT880 (600ohm) and so far have been quite disappointed in the sound. At around 30 hours of burn-in, the headphones still sound relatively bodiless. While I won't describe it as bright, the headphones seem to have a more upper mid focus, overall giving it a very thin sound.
I'm wondering if it's my amping that is the problem. So far I've paired it with my Fubar IV plus and Asus Xonar E1 with similar results. Are there any amps that have better synergy with the 880s that I can try? Or should I let the headphones burn in for a longer period before passing judgement? Or is that just the way the 880s sound?

Texas Health, Baylor Stake Claims for DFW Market
"You want to establish that you are moving forward," he says. "That is an inside-outside announcement: inside to reassure their people that they're doing what they need to do for success, and outside to say 'we a full-service provider.'"
The Baylor/Scott & White merger has no geographic overlap. Separately, the two systems are not natural competitors. However, Scott & White has an integrated health plan that, if extended to include Baylor facilities in Dallas, could provide critical savings through improved market share, vertical integrations and the elimination of "double marginalization" that comes when both payers and providers attempt to make a profit.
"Our new organization will not only prepare us for healthcare reform, but will help drive and shape what healthcare delivery in this country will become," Robert Pryor, MD, president/CEO of Scott & White Healthcare, said in prepared remarks last month.
"Scott & White has been recognized as a national leader for our strong physician-led population health model. Our shared vision with Baylor is to build upon our unique approach and create an innovative healthcare delivery model enhanced by medical education and research."
Self says comments by leadership in the two rival systems signal that they are positioning themselves to protect their mission interests and financial interests "before the real battle begins."<<

I have a family history of multiple sclerosis (MS). Is there any way to prevent it?
No matter how much you exercise, how healthful your diet or how well you take care of yourself, there is no way to prevent MS. It affects people randomly. But keep in mind that MS is not an inherited disease. Genetic susceptibility plays a role. Although there is a higher risk for MS in families where it has occurred, but just because you have a relative who has MS doesn't mean you will get it. Other possible factors in triggering MS are viruses, environmental factors and low levels of vitamin D. If you get MS, remember that it is somewhat manageable, and, if detected early, medications may slow the progress of the disease and the severity of symptoms.

CD Reviews: Alt-Stringbands Black Prairie and Real Vocal String Quartet
So yeah, I kinda made up the genre "alt-stringband", but I think it fits well. There are a good number of groups taking the old stringband idea and ramping it up with avant-garde arrangements inspired by jazz listening and conservatory training. These two bands are some of the best examples of where traditional stringbands have been taken today.
Black Prairie. A Tear in the Eye is a Wound in the Heart.
2012. Sugar Hill Records.
By now, most people should know that Black Prairie is the "stringband" side project of Decemberist members accordionist Jenny Conlee-Drizzos (Sparklepony from Portlandia!), dobro multi-instrumentalist Chris Funk, and bassist Nate Query (plus drummer John Moen). Portland roots scene stalwart John Neufeld (Jackstraw, Dolorean) rounds out the band, and Portland fiddler Annalisa Tornfelt steps up to the mic on the new disc, assuming lead vocal duties. She's got a gorgeous, ethereal voice, so it's great to hear Black Prairie bringing her more to the fore. Though the arrangements and compositions on the new album are notably complex and nuanced, really the key to Black Prairie is their insane blend of a hundred different cultural influences. In the space of one song, say "Dirty River Stomp," you can hear barrelhouse piano, old cartoon musical accompaniment, Parisian cafe nuances, and some grooved-out Zydeco accordion. "Taraf" features guest musicians Paul Beck on cimbalom (Hungarian hammered dulcimer associated with Roma music) and Irish pennywhistle player Hanz Araki and sounds like a full-blown Eastern European party. Perhaps the most interesting track conceptually is "34 Wishes," a riff-based folk jam that started off, according to Nate Query, as an attempt to put Mastodon's crushing heavy metal jams on to folk instruments. Hunting out strange musical influences in this new Black Prairie album becomes something of a fun game as you progress through it. But this hides the fact that only the best players can unite so many strange ideas into a cohesive whole. Don't try this at home folks, otherwise you end up with the gypsy-jazz-klezmer-slam-grass hybrids that seem to proliferate everywhere. Throughout all these madcap musical melanges, Annalisa Tornfelt's voice floats supreme. And the best tracks on the album are definitely the songs. "How Do You Ruin Me" got a ton of plays at our house before we got the advance copy, mainly because it's such a gorgeous, catchy song. "Little Song Bird" is another keeper, a great folk song that could fit on a lullaby album. "Rock of Ages" sounds like it could have come off a Sarah Jarosz album. Which makes sense since they're labelmates and have collaborated before. I guess the main point here is that Black Prairie is clearly having far too much fun rifling through each other's record collections for cool ideas to bother coming up with some kind of new genre definer for their music. Good thing too, who needs those phony genres anyway!
Black Prairie: Nowhere, Massachusetts
Real Vocal String Quartet. Four Little Sisters.
2012. Flower Note Records.. The cello buzzes along, often treated like a bass instrument (actually this is a tradition itself from Appalachia, where early stringbands couldn't afford or couldn't carry around full string basses, so used cellos), the fiddles soar together in twin flights, and the viola spins between both axes, pulling down grumbling rhythms and smooth melodic runs at the same time. This is definitely the kind of band that must have formed at a music conservatory from virtuosic musicians who were chafing from the strictures of classical music. I can see them all gathered in a rehearsal room in the stuffy conservatory, happily poring over their lists of favorite songs from any genre and dreaming up ways to arrange these songs for the quartet. I've met two of the four members of Real Vocal String Quartet actually, both at the Festival of American Fiddle Tunes, and they're dedicated roots musicians with the kind of chops to pull off these lush arrangements. Nice folks too!
Four Little Sisters is all over the map in terms of influences. Malian wassoulou singer Oumou Sangare is given a tribute track, Brazilian songwriter Gilberto Gil is featured as well with an arrangement and translation of his song "Copo Vazio", there's a nod to Cajun music with a cool remake of the common song "Allons à Lafayette," Swedish roots crossover band Väsen gets a nod as well with "Falling Polska", and there's even a cover of David Byrne's "Knotty Pine". Fiddler Alisa Rose's composition, "Elephant Dreams" is another standout track, matching a lilting Celtic-ish melody with some really cool harmonies and counterpoint.
There's no doubt this is a masterful album from a group with great vision and a lot to say. Search it out for yourself and you'll find that these four musicians leave few stones unturned in their quest to bring new traditions into their chamber stringband.

Ela Soroka is a news anchor and reporter with KTVO.
Ingredients:
4 T. unsalted butter
4 T. flour
1 t. baking soda
2 C. milk
1 28-oz. can of whole tomatoes with juice, chopped
1 T. tomato paste
1 t. salt
½ t. cracked pepper
½ t. celery seed (optional) You can also substitute ½ C finely chopped celery, lightly sautéed.
½ chopped onion, lightly sautéed (optional)
Directions:
In a large saucepan, melt the butter and add the flour, whisking vigorously to avoid lumps. Let the mixture (which is a roux, by the way) cook for a few minutes till it’s light golden brown in color. Whisk in the baking soda; then add the milk and whisk well to blend. You’ve just made béchamel (white) sauce! Let the sauce cook for several more minutes till it thickens. Add the chopped tomatoes with their juice and the tomato paste and season with salt, pepper, celery seed, and cooked onions. Switch to a spoon and keep stirring well to make sure the soup doesn’t stick or burn. (The tomatoes will gunk up your whisk.) Heat the soup through, garnish with fresh parsley or dried herbs and serve with toasted cheese sandwiches or your favorite accompaniment.
This soup is thick and chunky. If you wish, you can puree it in a blender. It’s also delicious cold.

God's One Wish Today
What is the one thing you would like to be true today? What is your heart longing for? If you could have one wish fulfilled today, what would it be?
This is hard to say because you find you have many wishes, and you don't want to give up any of them. Nor should you.
But today, write your list of wishes, and pick one, not three, to put up top. Don't worry. This will not exclude the others from tomorrow or even today, but today you pick one before all the others. It is like this: If you can have only one ribbon in your hair this morning, which one would you choose? The other ribbons remain for another day or perhaps even later today. It is the same with your wishes. Choosing one does not make the others less timely nor does it delete them.
Even when it is understood that you are not giving up anything by choosing one wish for today, still it is hard to come down to one, for many of your values are at stake. Naturally, you desire excellent health and wealth and love and success and you also wish for peace in the world. You also wish for lost loves to return, even if they are no longer on earth. So your wishes also fall under innately possible and innately impossible in the earth realm. Are there any other categories that your wishes fall under?
Do you perhaps feel guilt when you choose personal love over peace for the world, or success for yourself, as if you are putting yourself before others and somehow denying them? Be truthful. Now you are getting to why some of your longings have not been fulfilled. It is not clear to you that you are fully entitled to them.
You do not help others go forward when you straggle behind. As you personally manifest your desires, you bring others with you. So, right now, I limit the wishes you write down to those that are for your personally. This is the assignment. For the moment, put aside your wishes for others and the world and stick with your personal desires, even the wild ones. Never mind what you are supposed to wish for.
Read no further now. Stop, and write your long list as fast as you can. Write now.
Now that you have written your list, what have you learned about yourself? What is important to you? Which one of your wishes do you choose to head the list? Listen to your heart for this one. You are not choosing which one you think would come first if you were a better person or a more ambitious one or anything like that. Which one would you choose for your heart's content right now? When you let your heart choose, it is clear. It is only your mind that is confused and would waver.
I daresay that, when all is said and done, wealth is not your priority. You might have thought it would be. Well, when you worry, it is. Without worry, it is not. I will even venture that health is not at the top of your list. Again, when you worry it is. When you are not worried, it is not. I daresay that, perhaps to your surprise, neither fame nor whopping success head your list. I daresay that physical beauty does not. I will venture that your top wish has to do with love.
I do not want to tell you what your deepest wish above all is, but shall I tell you what My deepest wish for you today is? Shall I tell you? Or shall I not? I think I will.
My wish for you today above all is that you feel love in your heart.

Grand Concert/Avslutningskoncert
The Helena Döse Master Class 2013 will be the eighth event in a successful series of Master Classes held in Kungälv, Sweden. World renowned teacher Professor Rudolf Piernay, pianist Ulrich Staerk, and Anita Åstrand together with Helena Döse are teaming up to deliver high quality voice education. The course starts on Monday the 5th of August and ends with a public concert on Tuesday the 13th of August. A select group of 12 singers will be admitted.
Masterclass Faculty
Professor Rudolf Piernay is regarded as one of the most respected voice teachers around the world. Among his famous students are leading opera stars Bryn Terfel, Michael Volle, Melanie Diener, Anke Vondung and Kate Royal. Mr Piernay divides his time between Germany teaching at The Hochschule für Musik in Mannheim and London where he is based at The Guildhall School of Music & Drama.
Ulrich Staerk will be giving interpretation classes and creates magic. His coaching sessions with singers are extraordinary. He is regarded as one of the finest concert pianists in Scandinavia and is very sought after as a song- and opera accompanist worldwide. We are extremely proud and happy to have him as a member of our faculty.
Anita Åstrand is a licensed physicaltherapist, instruktor of yoga and dalcrozerythmic and a former professor at Academy of Music and Drama at Gothenburg University. She will guide the participents through the "Elsa technique" in groups and in private sessions. The work is focused on a greater body awareness to free creativity and vocal possibility to enable a stronger and freer voice with true expression.

Cord Blood transfusion for children with Type 1 Diabetes
The aim of this study is to improve the control of blood glucose in children with type 1 diabetes, with an autologous cord blood transfusion. In the USA already 23 children with newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes received a cord blood transfusion.
Analyses of changes in peripheral blood regulatory T cells (Treg) concentration demonstrated a 42 % fractional increase of Treg during the 6 months immediately after cord blood infusion. The children with transfusion had a lower HbA1c value and a higher stimulated c-peptide level compared to the control group. After twelve months there was no significantly difference in the HbA1c and the insulin dose between umbilical cord blood recipients and control subjects. Whereas the HbA1c was stable over the 1 year of follow up in the transfusion group and the GAD antibody concentration decreased form 4.2 units/ml to 3.5 units/ml. No adverse events were observed in association with autologous umbilical cord blood infusion. These results show that umbilical cord blood in young children with type 1 diabetes is feasible and safe.
In Germany 10 children will receive an autologous cord blood transfusion. Five children have received an autologous umbilcal cord blood infusion, already. The participants should be older than 1 year and the diagnose of type 1 diagnose should not be longer than 12 months. The children must have stored their own cord blood sample. Another 20 children without a cord blood sample can participate in a control group to evaluate c-petptide, insulin, antibodies, HbA1c and T-cells.

If you've paid attention to BMW over the years you know that the 7-series is not only their flagship line but the test bed for new design cues and technologies that eventually trickle down to their other models. Few cars let alone BMWs have sparked as much controversy as the E65 7-series. Introduced in 2002 to replace the aging E38 the E65 featured a polarizing new look and more technology than most modern battleships. Despite mixed initial reactions the car went on to become the best-selling 7-series of all time simply by being an extraordinary car to drive be driven in and live with every day. Dressed in a tasteful palette of grays this 2004 745Li is a great example of the car so many BMW enthusiasts have grown to love. Low-mileage and clean in every way this 7-series is a perfect intersection of luxury power and value. If that sounds like the perfect combination for you settle in and learn a bit more about this sharp '04 745Li.
The design was a joint effort between Adrian van Hooydonk and then chief designer Chris Bangle. Though the car seems straightforward at first glance a closer looks reveals a complex blend of short long angular and curved lines that combine to give the E65 its calm stately appearance. The front remains pure BMW with kidney grilles framed by dual bi-xenon headlights. The side profile extends a straight line from the edge of those headlights all the way back to the taillights. Dual heated rear view mirrors anchor the A-pillars for some added luxury when the weather outside is frightful. Above a coupe-like roof line flows into the split-level rear view that critics nicknamed the ''Bangle butt''. With its distinctive light bar chrome trim and bold '745Li' badge at the edge of the automatic deck lid no one will ever question this BMW's identity. As a low mileage car this 745Li presents as new with crisp dent-free panels and the excellent fit and finish so closely associated with European luxury cars. The bodywork is dressed in an even coat of Sterling Gray which complements the car's personality perfectly.
Open the soft-touch doors and this E65 offers all the luxury you've come to expect from BMW. The Basalt Grey leather interior is accented by large expanses of dark wood trim which can be found on the dash center console and door panels. The front features seating for two on heated leather bucket seats while a large standard seat fills the back. In between the front seats the well-dressed console offers control over the iDrive system - a computer system used to control accessories such as climate control the audio system and the navigation system from a single location. While there is a bit of a learning curve with iDrive it eventually becomes second nature and a very welcome presence in the cabin. The console also hosts bonus niceties like a climate-controlled storage compartment. From the driver seat a simple but attractive gauge cluster mixes plainspoken gauges with red backlighting for a contemporary feel. In front of the cluster control of the front wheels is granted through a leather-wrapped steering wheel mounted atop a power tilt/telescopic column. Above the driver a large sunroof brings the outdoors inside. Behind the rear seat a cavernous trunk offers more storage than most apartments making the car ideally suited for extended travel.
Motivation for the sedan comes from a stout N62 DOHC 32-valve 4.4 liter V8. Named the ''Best New Engine'' of 2002 the V8 utilizes variable valve timing for both the inlet and exhaust cams as well as variable valve lift. With 325hp at its disposal the 4545lb sedan is capable of impressive 6-second 0-60mph sprints. Behind the V8 a six-speed Steptronic transmission monitors a variety of perimeters in order to adapt to the driver's preferred driving style. The chassis is equally as sophisticated with systems like Dynamic Stability Control Dynamic Traction Control and Dynamic Braking Control which clamps down on four-wheel ventilated discs controlled by electronic proportioning. Steering is also adaptive thanks to its speed-sensitive variable-assist variable-ratio power rack and pinion setup. All these systems pair with the basic aluminum double-pivot strut-type front suspension and four-link integral rear suspension for a driving experience worthy of the BMW name. At the corners attractive 18x8 inch alloy wheels meet the road through new Falken tires.
As a late-model car all the standard BMW paperwork comes with the car. This includes a leather-clad owner's manual BMW marketing materials and the original window sticker which pegs the price of the car at $76430 brand new.
The BMW 7-series has always had an authoritative presence on the road. The E65s took that presence and expanded it into a car that everyone stops and notices. Powerful luxurious and worthy of the ''flagship'' title it's difficult to think a more comfortable daily driver. If you loved the distinctive styling of the E65 but had a hard time swallowing the $75k+ price tag here's your opportunity to buy a practically new 745Li for a fraction of the price. Everyone deserves a little luxury after all.
Price: $29,900

Spiritual Directors: Mark Anderson, Rick Hatem, Wil Hernandez, Joann Nesser, Karen Patena, Susan Vander Woude
Mark Anderson
My wife, Petra and I have two children in College and together co-pastor a small congregation in Vancouver, British Columbia. In addition to offering Spiritual Direction, I also draw on my background as a consulting engineer to provide Whole Life Coaching to leaders in ministry and the corporate world. My passion is to help professionals have an inner experience of God that is just as real and formative in their lives as their career and family. To this end, I have an M.Div. from Regent College with an emphasis on biblical spirituality and a 2-year Certificate in Spiritual Direction from SoulStream. I grew up outside the church and remember as a young adult finding the hope which faith in Jesus can bring. However, professional training and the complex demands of life in our society can steal away all our joy if we do not continue to mature spiritually. This results in a deep emptiness and hunger for more. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, business executives, sales people, artists, pastors, and church planters ... if you are looking for more to life: healing, freedom, and effectiveness, I'd love to join you in paying attention to what God is doing in and around you. While meeting in person for Spiritual Direction has definite advantages, I do most of my one-on-one work with people over the phone. When I'm not walking with people, I'm out walking with our dog, or paddling a canoe, or snowboarding, or mountain biking, or planning a trip, or ... well, you get the idea!
Rick Hatem
I am in my late 50’s, single and Catholic. My training as a spiritual director was with the Spiritual Renewal Center in Syracuse, NY. Today I work as a spiritual director through The Spirituality Network in Columbus, Ohio and am a supervisor in Wellstreams, an Ecumenical Program of Spiritual Formation and Training in the Art of Spiritual Direction. I lived in Jerusalem between 1986 and 1991 and was active in dialogue with Jews, Muslims & Christians. In 1987 I joined l’Arche Bethany, the first l’Arche community in the Middle East. Daily Bible reading, centering prayer, experiences with the three Abrahamic religions, and 12 years in l’Arche influence my spirituality. I lead retreats using scripture stories to explore life. Beginning in 2001, I helped my parents for nearly a decade in the challenges of aging and my mother’s Alzheimer’s. They were able to remain in the rural home they built until shortly before their deaths five months apart.
Wil Hernandez
I graduated with a Ph.D. in Practical Theology with a special concentration in Spirituality from Fuller Theological Seminary (with additional training from the University of Notre Dame and Loyola Marymount University). I am a trained counselor and a certified spiritual director who holds a private practice in Southern California. In addition, I teach courses and conduct retreats all year round on Henri Nouwen and his writings. I have written three books on the spirituality of Nouwen all published by Paulist Press: Henri Nouwen: A Spirituality of Imperfection (2006) and Henri Nouwen and SoulCare: A Ministry of Integration (2008) and Henri Nouwen and Spiritual Polarities: A Life of Tension (2012). I consider it a privilege to accompany people on their spiritual journey regardless of where they're at. I enjoy working ecumenically with both Catholics and Protestants, two faith traditions I feel equally at home with. I have been married now for more than 25 years to Juliet and blessed with two grown-up sons, Jonathan and David. Reading books of all types remains my favorite pastime of all! You can check out my website at:
Joann Nesser, DMin
I am a graduate of the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation, have an MA in Pastoral Theology and Ministry from Luther Seminary and a DMin in Spiritual Direction. I am Founder and retired Executive Director of Christos Center for Spiritual Formation outside St. Paul, MN. USA. I have led retreats, workshops and classes on contemplative prayer, spiritual direction and formation in the US, Canada, Europe and Africa as well as authored several books and articles on related topics. After reading Henri’s books for years, by happy chance I was able to spend a week retreating at Dayspring with him. I accompanied him to offer Eucharist at the group homes in Toronto, we ate meals together, washed dishes together and I was able to attend the daily Eucharist and much informal chatting. I have never met a person so open, and real. He was a window to God for me. I will treasure these memories always. My Book titles: Contemplative Prayer: Attending to Prayer When the Well Runs Dry and Journey Into Reality. Articles: Presence Magazine (Spiritual Directors International Journal) several including June 2011 issue; The Lutheran; Thrivent Financial Publication. I am available for email and telephone spiritual direction.
Karen Patena
I am a spiritual and retreat director as well as a certified lay ecclesial minister in the Cleveland, Ohio Catholic Diocese. For 9 years I facilitated lay ecclesial minister candidates in their spiritual formation year. My ministry includes giving retreats, one-on-one and group spiritual direction as well as preparing couples for marriage and guiding couples already married. I have a particular love for praying with Scriptures and reflecting on the lives of the saints, the 'big S’ and 'little s’ saints as I like to call them. I see in the stories of their lives God’s passionate love for us and the invitation for all of us to respond to His incredible love. Henri Nouwen is a great example to me of a 'little s’ saint. He has served at times as my mentor and spiritual director through the gift of his life and his writings. His honesty, openness of sharing his life’s struggles, the clarity in which he wrote, and the depth of his insights has touched my life tremendously. My incredibly supportive husband, Jim, and I take great delight in our two grown sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren. I love reading, walking, and nature, especially sunsets on Lake Erie.
Susan Vander Woude
I graduated from Tyndale Seminary, Toronto with a Master of Divinity Degree with a counseling focus in 2000, received training in spiritual direction at Tyndale and at Loyola House in Guelph, Ontario, and have been a spiritual director for several years. Henri Nouwen has been an influential mentor to me through his writing and life witness. It is great privilege for me to witness and accompany others as they journey more intentionally with God. I’m a supervisor for spiritual directors, facilitator for SoulStream’s Art of Spiritual Direction Program, and facilitate Spiritual Direction Groups. I have been married to Tony for 45 years and we live in British Columbia, Canada. I'm mother to three grown children and grandma to six grandchildren. I enjoy walking, hiking, reading, traveling, exploring, gentle yoga, watercolor painting and being a grandma.

The concept of hard-working, tough-nosed athletes from rural America has become somewhat of a cliché these days, and with that cliché has sprouted a number of stereotypes. Some of these stereotypes are true, but most do a grave injustice to the kids they represent.
Yes, these kids like putting their hands in the dirt and getting their faces a little muddy, as the cliché goes, and yes, the hard work they put in at their family farms often helps make them physically stronger, but that is where the comparisons end.
Some movies and television shows in popular culture like to paint these kids as corn-fed hicks, bred for strength, but not brains. They have names like Billy Ray and Bobby Sue, but these misrepresentations couldn’t be farther from the truth.
The reality is that these homegrown athletes from farms and rural communities across the country aren’t just strong, but smart, to boot. They might have to work harder in life than a kid that grows up in a metro area, and they probably don’t have as many resources, but that is why they learn to adapt, and become stronger physically, and mentally, in the long run.
Senior Mark Nowak, junior Jasper Asplin, and sophomore Kelsey Hartkopf are three such Dassel-Cokato student athletes.
All three of these kids have grown up on local farms, and all three find time to play in two sports or more while also going to school, and helping at home.
They and their coaches agree, it has given them a strong work ethic and determination that propels them to become better at their sports.
Nowak lives on a farm south of Dassel, and helps his father with things around the farm.
“It’s like a hobby farm,” he said. “My dad rents quite a bit, and then I just have to help him. We have a couple cattle, but it’s small.
“I do some digging in the fall and spring. After we combine, we go out and dig it. Sometimes I combine corn. I haven’t done beans yet; dad does those.”
Nowak plays football in the fall and basketball during the winter. He is also thinking about going out for track and field this spring.
Fall is the busiest time for him between school, football, and chores at home, but he finds a way to make it work, even if he has to get up early, while many of his classmates are probably still sleeping.
“With football, it is kind of hard with evening practice until 5 p.m., and then I have homework,” Nowak said. “I still go out and help him a little bit. Sometimes, in the mornings, I have to bring him out to the field.”
Nowak is proud of the work he does, and feels it helps him in other parts of his life, like sports and school.
“It gives you a lot of values, like hard work,” he said.
Asplin is another farming athlete, and he lives on the Asplin family farm south of Dassel.
“We have a family farm, the Asplin farm; that’s my dad’s farm,” he said. “We’ve probably been farming there for a couple generations.”
He, too, plays football and basketball, but he also plays baseball during the spring and summer. His is a good-size farm, and that keeps him busy.
“We have eight steers at our house, and what I usually do is bale hay and rock pick,” Asplin said. “I mainly do the manual labor, but I have been starting on the tractor now, and that is fun.
“I usually work on the weekends because of how busy I am during the weekdays with school and sports. Being in three sports, and summer baseball, takes up a lot of time.”
For Asplin, the best part about working on the farm is the quality time he gets with his family.
“I like spending time with my dad,” Asplin said. “That is our main time together, with my brothers.”
The work isn’t always fun, though, and he says that one of the jobs he likes the least is cleaning the corn out from the bottom of the silo bins.
“We have to do it manually with a tube, and that is the worst,” he said. “It is so hot.”
Even though he hates this part of the work, he puts up with it. This is the type of attitude that makes Asplin and Nowak great kids to have on a team, and DC head football coach Ryan Weinandt is well aware of that.
“They have a big-time work ethic,” Weinandt said. “Mark and Jasper are two of the hardest working guys on our team. And, there is just a sense that there is no excuses and no complaining.
“They are used to putting their nose to the grindstone and doing what is expected, and then some on top of that.”
Hartkopf is the youngest of the three farming athletes, but, is no different when it comes to what is expected of her at home, and the effort she puts out.
What is different is the work she does, and the type of farm she lives on an elk farm south of Howard Lake.
“I have to feed them, and sometimes care for them by giving them shots and stuff like that,” she said. “Usually, I work at night, around 6 p.m. We’ll go out and feed them, and tend to whatever needs they have. It’s usually after practice.”
Hartkopf is another three-sport athlete. She plays volleyball in the fall, basketball in the winter, and softball in the spring.
She loves the work she does at home, and also appreciates the values she learns.
“I like the experiences with animals,” she said. “Doing different stuff with them. Learning how to take care of them, and being responsible with them.”
Not only does she feel her work helps her physically, but it also helps her in another important aspect of life and sports.
“I think it helps with my strength. Carrying the feed around makes me stronger,” Hartkopf said. “It also helps my communication skills. Working with animals, you have to communicate a lot.”
Although Hartkopf is just a sophomore, and her full potential as an athlete is still developing, she is being noticed by coaches, including DC head volleyball coach Beth Flick.
After seeing Hartkopf’s tough work ethic coming into this season, Flick decided Hartkopf should be one of only four sophomores on the varsity roster.
“She played on the ninth-grade team last year, and the other sophomores that are playing with us were on the junior varsity team, so she has made a big jump,” Flick said. “It’s really her work ethic that caught my eye right away. We saw her do some things during the offseason, and the more I saw her, the more I felt we really needed her to be playing and practicing at the varsity level.”
Farm kids like these three are a credit to their schools, and lifestyle. While some stereotypes try to make them out to be something they aren’t, you won’t hear them complaining. They’ll just keep going to work every day, whether that be at school, in sports, or on the farm, knowing they are the true representation of rural athletes.

ONE IN THREE couples argue while on their two-week annual holiday abroad, a new survey reveals.
And of over 7,500 Irish people surveyed by AA Travel Insurance, over a third, 36pc, said that "different interests" were a source of much of the tension.
"We spend so much time looking forward to holidays and probably not enough time thinking about what we will do when we arrive," said the AA's Conor Faughnan.
"People who talk freely about different interests in advance are far less likely to fall out with each other while away," he added.
The survey also found that 12pc of couples will argue about where to go on holidays in the first place, and while away, issues like timekeeping, tidiness and different interests are likely to set at least a third of us squabbling with our partners.
"We were a little surprised at the results but I guess they tell us that we are all human," Mr Faughnan said.
"As well as the overall findings we had over 500 individual comments made about the type of rows people have while on holidays." The survey found that that rows began at home over the amount of luggage to bring. Women complained that their their partners were often disorganised and late. Bringing the children on a plane was also suggested as a likely flashpoint, the AA found.
Stress
"Our respondents had a lot of common sense advice to give us on how to stay stress-free," says Mr Faughnan.
"The key is good communication. Discuss your plans well in advance, not just about where you are going to go but about what you are going to do when you get there."
Some 15pc of the 7,710 respondents to the poll said they were either 'very likely' or 'somewhat likely' to have an argument about alcohol. This may be because one partner or another is drinking too much.
"Too many foreign beers, sangrias or ouzos are a very bad combination in very hot sunshine," says Mr Faughnan. "Gently does it... it's better for your body and for your relationship."

Majid Haq last night upstaged the county recruits as Scotland enjoyed a run feast on the opening day of their latest tour match in South Africa, writes William Dick.
Matt Machan, who scored a century last week, looked set to take the batting honours again with a sparkling 91. However, Clydesdale's Haq finished unbeaten on 93 as the Saltires closed on 387-9 in their three-day match with North West Dragons.

STEUBENVILLE - City Council and administration officials met behind closed doors for two-and-a-half hours Tuesday to discuss "personnel and contract negotiations" before listening to local residents ask for the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center to remain open in the light of a looming general fund $822,968 budget deficit.
City Manager Cathy Davison said the executive session, "saw progress in us moving forward to correct the projected deficit. The council and administration have agreed on a plan to resolve the issue."
"Unfortunately, almost 90 percent of our general fund budget is salaries and benefits. We have requested the city unions to join the rest of us in reaching a solution to the projected deficit," said Davison.
Davison sent an e-mail following last week's special city council closed-door meeting to union representatives requesting the three city unions agree to changes in the employee health care program and a 7 percent cut in wages.
Davison, Law Director S. Gary Repella and Finance Director Alyssa Kerker met with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 2015 last week and with the International Association of Firefighters Local 228 on Monday.
She said she has not received a response from the Fraternal Order of Police Ohio Labor Council .
"We are asking union and non-union to share equally to resolve the deficit issue for the future of our city," Davison said following the Tuesday night council meeting.
"If we," stated Davison.
She said the city finance office, "will be moving a small cash balance to the 2013 budget.
Sixth Ward Councilman David Lalich, who serves as chairman of the council Finance Committee, said Tuesday night the deficit, "is especially stressful on city employees as well as the community."
"We are discussing difficult options. Personnel cuts may be necessary if we don't see cooperation from everyone. I hope all city employees consider their fellow workers who also have families when making their decisions," said Lalich.
Davison also met Tuesday morning with Jefferson County Commissioner Thomas Graham and Jefferson County Auditor Pat Marshall, "for discussions on collaboration."
"Councilman Lalich has discussed the need for regionalization of water services in the county. So, with the agreement from Commissioner Graham, I will be contacting the waterworks association and asking them to conduct a feasibility study on how we may be able to create a regional water utility," explained Davison.
"We will continue our discussions with the county and I believe we can move forward with collaboration efforts. Council will meet in executive session next week to continue to review our end-of-the-year projected budget deficit and our options in resolving the deficit," Davison noted.
Council heard from three residents who urged city officials to keep the MLK Recreation Center open.
"I understand the city is facing difficulties. But can we start a drive to save the MLK Center? I am afraid if the center closes there will be more violence because the youth will have no place to go," Terese Elder told the council members.
"I agree. I understand we are facing a deficit. But we are going to see more violence if the center closes. Children go there to play. Senior citizens go there to socialize and play games. I am asking you to please find a way to keep the MLK Center open at least a few days a week or a few hours a day," said Delores Wiggins.
During the meeting, council approved two ordinances as emergencies and supported a resolution opposing n Ohio House of Representatives bill now under consideration.
Council authorized Davison to proceed with a task order with MWH Constructors Inc. for repairs to the 100-year-old sewer line that runs under University Boulevard.
City officials have said the sewer line is in immediate need of repair and a void created beneath the brick and block sewer must be backfilled in order to avoid a sinkhole in the future.
Members also passed an energy service agreement as an emergency with Plug Smart for a review of all energy used by the city.
And, the council passed a resolution opposing the passage of HB 601 by the Ohio General Assembly which proposes uniformity measures for municipal income taxes.
First Ward Councilman Gerald DiLoreto reported a recent tire drop-off campaign coordinated by the city and the JB Green Team saw 503 tires brought to a collection center.
"Next, we are going to start cleaning up all of the mattresses that are dumped in the city," promised DiLoreto.
And John Poole of county Road 26 asked the city to replace a water line in his neighborhood that has broken several times.
"I am tired of buying heating elements for my hot water heater because every time the city shuts off the water to repair the line it acts as a siphon and drains the water from our local residences. In my case it drains water out of my hot water tank," said Poole.

Causes for Low sperm Count, remedies
Causes for Low sperm count and helpful remedies
By Veena Deo
This article is about causes for low sperm count and some of the remedies that can be followed to alleviate this situation.
The male sperm is an impregnating fluid. The semen is a Viscid whitish fluid of the male reproductive tract consisting of spermatozoa suspended in Secretion of the accessory glands and of the Prostate and Cowper’s gland. As per Ayurveda the properties of a good sperm are being thick, slimy, White, Sweet and unctuousness.
Causes for low sperm count that men experience-
Stress, Strain, Blood sugar conditions, Obesity, advanced age, excessive intake of alcohol, steroid usage, smoking, excessive exposures to heat, use of antidepressant pills, unbalanced food, are all the causes of low sperm count. Studies show that electromagnetic frequencies also affect the sperm count. Researchers find that men who spent more than four hours a day on their cell phones had lower sperm counts, less motile sperms and more irregularly shaped sperms than men who did not use cell phones.
Hormones also play an important role in semen production and in the fertility of men. One of the main hormones is testosterone. Insufficient levels of Testosterone, imbalance in Lutinizing hormone and Follicle stimulating hormone in men can affect the Sperm Production. Diet also has a big impact on sperm health. Let us discuss how deficiencies of Vitamins minerals affect the sperm count or sperm quality.
Herbal remedies for low sperm count and low libido Video
Zinc – Zinc deficiency results in the less production of Testosterone levels. A study done at Michael Busk Sorensen and published in MHR Basic science of Reproductive Medicine in 1999 showed that Zinc concentrations are crucial for adequate sperm mobility. Dietary sources of Zinc are Yogurt, Cashew nuts etc.
Folic Acid – Recent Research done at Netherlands shows that zinc can become most effective in improving semen quality in sub fertile men. The Dutch team published their findings in the March issue of the Journal Fertility and sterility. Zinc and Folic acid both are known to be essential for the creation of DNA and sperm. Research Done in Holland shows a diet rich with folic acid and zinc can effectively improve semen quality in Sub Fertile men.
Co-enzyme Q10 – A study done in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Hadassah – Hebrew university medical school in Israel revealed that oral administration of 60mg of Co-enzyme Q10 significantly increased fertilization in study subjects. The results of this study favorably predict the positive function and mobility. Dietary sources – Soybean oil, Sesame seeds Peanuts etc.
L-Carnitine, Amino Acid L – Carnitine plays an important role in the process of sperm formation, sperm maturation and in the maintenance of sperm quality L-Carnitine plays a crucial role in sperm development and maturation. It plays a vital role in maintaining the sperm membrane and the metabolic processing of endogenous fuel into energy, expressed as sperm mobility.
Vit B12 – is found only in animal foods. Some studies suggest that B12 supplements may improve sperm count and sperm mobility. But lot of research work is required for this. Some researchers observed that the men, who have Vit B12 deficiency, have fertility issues also.
Also read articles on- Stress supplements
Two Brazilian studies published in 2005 confirmed earlier suspicions that caffeine could improve sperm mobility. But lot of research work is required to establish this.
Now let us discuss about the Herbs known to improve sperm count, mobility and quality.
1. Blepharis Edulis (Utangan): Is an aphrodisiac, sex stimulant and spermatogenia can be given in spermatorrhoea and impotency situations.
2. Chlorphytum Arundinaceum (Safed Musali) Indicated in impotency. It is a nourishing and rejuvenating, aphrodisiac. Ref. Material, Medica of Ayurveda by Vaidya Bhagwan Dash et. al, 1980, 50 ;Raj Nighantu.
3. Argyrevia Speciosa – It promotes fertility, increases sperm count and sperm mobility. It is also effective to treat male impotency and sterility as evidenced by increase in Testosterone in alcohol exposed rats. Ref. Mitra SK, Muralidhar TS, Roo D.R. “Experimental assessment of relative efficacy of drugs of herbal origin on sexual performance and hormone levels in alcohol exposed and normal rats. Phytother Res. 1996, 10, 10: 296-9
4. Hygrophila Auriculata seeds (Talmakhana) - Prescribed seeds in impotency and spermatorrhoea. This herb can be used as an ingredient in herbal formulations prepared for aphrodisiac, impotence and in seminal and other debilities. Ref. IMM – 668-669.Sushrut samhita, Chikitsa sutrasthan 26; Ashtang Hridya Chikitsathan 22; Raj Nighantu.
5. Orchis Latifolia (Salabmisri) - Restorative, invigorative and aphrodisiac. Useful in impotency. Charak, Sutrasthan 27, recognized its anabolic, tonic and aphrodisiac properties.
6. Leptadenia Reticulate (Jeevanti) - Increases sperm count and sperm – mobility. Promotes Spermatogenesis by improving the testicular, seminal vesicle and epididymal function.
7. Saw palmetto (serenoa-repens) - A natural steroid that tones and strengthens the reproductive system. It increases libido and sperm count.
8. Horny Goat Weed - It supports healthy seminal emission by action on the prostate gland and the seminal vesicles. It is a powerful sexual tonic. It promotes production of healthy testosterone. Several studies show that this herb has a potential to increase sperm production.
Here are a few simple things that people can do to increase sperm count naturally-
Quit smoking, follow a balanced diet, avoid working in stressful atmosphere, sleep for about 6 to 8 hours, avoid hot showers and avoid wearing tight undergarments.
I hope this article helps all men to understand as to the causes for low sperm count and some remedies that can be followed by all.

4. Tuna Apple Salad
Apples are also surprisingly complementary to tuna, and a salad containing both ingredients is healthier than a traditional tuna sandwich! Put the dressing in a small container and add it to your salad right before eating – that way the spinach won’t get soggy.
Ingredients:
5 oz can of your favorite tuna
Apples cut into small squares
Cheese cut into small squares
Grapes, halved
Lettuce
Olive Oil
Mustard
Directions:
Put lettuce in large Tupperware container. Add cubed cheese and cubed apples. Drain tuna and place in separate bowl. Mash and break up tuna with a fork, adding olive oil to taste. Throw halved grapes into tuna mixture and add tuna mixture to salad. In a separate container, add olive oil and mustard for dressing. Always add 3 times as much olive oil as mustard, otherwise mustard will overpower salad. Sprinkle salt and pepper, if available, into dressing.
5. Fruit and Cheese Plate
The traditional soups, sandwiches and salads of lunch can get old, so add some variety to your diet by packing a fruit and cheese platter once in awhile!
Ingredients:
Cheese
Apples
Grapes
Salami
Crackers
Directions:
Put two handfuls of crackers in Zip-loc bag. In additional bags, add cheddar cheese, grapes and slices of salami. Also grab apples and knife for cutting cheese.
6. Mediterranean Sandwich
This do-it-yourself version of the traditional Greek gyro is a great way to mix up your lunchtime routine. Throw it together in the morning before class – as the sandwich sits, the flavors get even better! For a twist on traditional sandwiches, try buying pita bread instead of normal bread during your next visit to the grocery store.
Ingredients:
Deli sliced chicken
2 slices of bread
Olive oil
Greek yogurt
Feta Cheese
Cucumber, diced finely
Lettuce
Tomatoes, diced
Directions:
In a small bowl, mix 3 T yogurt, a handful of diced cucumber, a dash of olive oil and 1 T feta. Add 2 slices of meat and lettuce to bread. Sprinkle diced tomatoes over lettuce. Add yogurt mixture to sandwich between layers of meat and veggies to avoid soggy bread.

As You Like It (or Not)
The play starts with a clever and well-executed live recreation of a silent movie clip, setting the scene for the beginning of the action. The scene then shifts to a conventional theater stage, with décor and costumes implying puritan England. Things work well like this until the main characters all flee tyranny and end up in the forest of Arden, which has somehow been relocated to the East Coast of North America. The same stage magic that merged two continents also transformed time, placing the continuing action just prior to the American Revolution.
That transition was jarring and a little disorienting. But the tie in with a search for freedom made it somewhat palatable. Unfortunately it didn’t stop there. Suddenly years and sets began to change at a dizzying pace. The play skipped merrily through almost 200 years in two hours which seemed like an eternity.
But wait, there’s more: the movie theme resurfaced. With each scene change various camera crews, gaffers, etc., swarmed the stage, then faded into the wings.
I kept waiting for the director to tie it all together, but when the spectacle was over, I was merely confused and disappointed.

2013 Not-for-Profit Training Series
The Let's Practice Outcomes session scheduled on Thursday, April 25th has been cancelled due to health issues.
Welcoming Community
Will Miller, president of The Wallace Foundation in New York City and former president and CEO of Irwin Management Company was the keynote speaker at the Human Rights Commission Annual Meeting on April 10th. The theme of the meeting was “The Columbus Journey to Building a Welcoming Community.” Will focused his speech on how a commitment to making everyone in a community feel welcome and respected is in everyone’s best interest.
Will’s speech in 2004 at the Economic Development Board Annual Meeting was a key driver to the Heritage Fund’s Outreach Committee’s Welcoming Community work. His graphic of critical issues a community needed to address to create a healthy and vibrant economic base was based on the presence of three factors:
• Attractive Educational Opportunities
• Leisure and Cultural Activities
• Welcoming Culture
Following the 2004 speech the Outreach Committee conducted its first Welcoming Community study and found that while Columbus has many positive attributes it was not perceived as a welcoming community to all people, particularly:
• People outside the traditional mainstream
• Young people
• Newcomers
In the years since results of study were published community leaders and organizations have worked to address recommendations made by the Committee. The Outreach Committee conducted a follow up study; Welcoming Community II (WCII) in 2011 to gauge whether there had been improvements. Will referenced the groundbreaking work of the studies during his speech at the Human Rights Dinner. WC II reported many areas of improvement within the community and offered seven recommendations for community leaders, organizations and residents to continue to grow the welcoming factor.
Welcoming Community II Report
The Outreach Committee continues its work in promoting the importance of a welcoming culture in Columbus and Bartholomew County. We encourage you to read more about the study and contact Lyn Morgan, lmorgan@heritagefundbc.org with any comments and questions.
Community Fund Grants Program
Heritage Fund invited staff and Board members from local not-for-profit organizations to attend a breakfast meeting at YES Cinema on March 12th to learn about changes to the Community Fund Grant Program.
In 2012 the Heritage Board undertook a detail review of policies and procedures. The process included a revision of the Areas of Initiative. Heritage Fund’s Board of Directors has identified four community issues where the foundation intends to take an active leadership role. The Areas of Initiative provide the framework for the.
Community Investment Grants
The Community Investment Program was created to encourage innovative ideas and solutions that will address our community’s most pressing needs and make Bartholomew County a welcoming and vibrant place to live and work. The grant program is designed to offer support for programs and initiatives that provide a strategic and innovative approach that will positively impact the community and deliver measurable results.
Positive Change Grants
The Positive Change Grant Program is designed to support community programs and projects that strengthen and improve the quality of life in Bartholomew County. The grant program is designed to support programs and initiatives that offer solutions for positive change for our community and its residents.

Opportunity Grants
The Opportunity Grants Program provides an opportunity for not-for-profit organizations to seek funding support for governance and effectiveness projects, staff training programs or urgent needs.
Detailed information regarding the restructured program as well as grant forms can be accessed in the Grant Application/Document Center.
Grant a Wish 2012
We would like to thank everyone who made gifts to the Grant a Wish Program during the holiday season. This year Heritage Fund received gifts totaling $31,000 to the Grant a Wish Program from 140 individual and family donors. More than 233 wishes were granted, many as holiday gifts in honor of friends and family members.
The Heritage Fund’s Community Fund along with Elwood Staffing, MainSource Bank and Marguerite Rust provided matching funds which will result in more than $58,000 being distributed among the 38 Grant a Wish organizations.
Tracy Souza, President and CEO, spoke about the program, “Once again the generosity of our community was demonstrated by the response to the Grant a Wish program. Every non-profit organization that submitted a wish will receive grant funds and the Heritage Fund had the good problem of finding additional match money to ensure that all donor gifts were matched.”
Lincoln Centeral Neighborhood Family Center had a number of wishes granted. Randy Allman, Executive Director shared the following, “The Heritage Fund never ceases to impress! Its understanding of - and appreciation for - the non-profit community throughout Bartholomew County is simply amazing! The proactive nature of the Grant a Wish Program challenges all non-profits to think creatively when serving our clients. Individuals, families, children and adults have benefited from the visionary leadership of the Heritage Fund’s Board and staff!”
The generosity of Heritage Fund donors meant that:
- Children living in foster homes will have the opportunity for family outings to the zoo
- Children from less fortunate families will be involved in sports activities at Foundation for Youth and Columbus Parks and Rec.
- Cats and Dogs at the Humane Society will be fed and receive medications
- Children with Special Needs will attend the Very Special Arts Festival
- Love Chapel clients will receive gift cards to purchase meat.
- Simmons One Room School House can replace worn and damaged old fashioned toys.
- Aging and Community Services will provide meals to home bound seniors
- Sans Souci will provide blankets to clients to enable them to stay warm over the winter
The Grant a Wish program is now closed. We encourage individuals and organizations interested in providing support for the changing needs within our community to make a donation to the Community Fund. The Community Fund provided support for the Grant a Wish program aswell as funding support for a significant number of community programs. Grant awards from the Community Fund during 2012 totaled more than $400,000.

Neither Scott Brown nor Elizabeth Warren had much to say during their campaign about Warren’s expertise on bankruptcy and financial regulation. Writing for The Daily Beast, Daniel Gross makes her sound like an impact player:
At no time in recent history has there been a senator who knows so much about Wall Street—and is so little beholden to it.
Gross says the assumption is she’ll be named to the Senate Banking Committee, where she’ll be able to oversee the implementation of Dodd-Frank and protect her Consumer Finance Protection Bureau from efforts to undermine it. But while Brown caricatured Warren as a party-line Democratic hack, her record suggests otherwise:.”

National:
And below is the full roster for the recruiting class of 2013 complete with links to their bios here at HLS:
Personally, I’m thrilled with this class. The only thing that would’ve possibly made this class better would have been if Alex Anzalone had stayed in the fold to bring the class to a full 25, but, honestly, at that point, I’m just being greedy.
With this class the Irish could almost field an entire team of just freshmen on both sides of the ball save for one linebacker. The Irish managed to snag four five-star players (according to Rivals) which is the most I can ever remember the Irish having in a single class.
Notre Dame also only trailed a single school in the Rivals average star ranking. That school is Southern Cal, who bested the Irish’s 3.92 average stars with 4.42 average stars — of course, USC only managed to sign 12 players, so that skews that average ever so slightly.
Oh, and right below the Irish in the same ranking: Alabama with 3.84 average stars.
I could go on and continuously gush about this class, but the bottom line is that Notre Dame finished yesterday with an elite recruiting class. It is incredibly well balanced, addresses areas of need, and stocks the depth chart in crucial areas like both the offensive and defensive line (and Brian Kelly said he still considers those areas of need for 2014 — this is a man after my own heart).
Be excited, be very excited about what Brian Kelly and his staff just pulled off. This future is beyond bright for this team.
Finally, the folks at IBN Sports have reached out to us to share their ND signing day segment, featuring Mike Frank of Irish Sports Daily. They have loads of other signing day segments over at their site as well so be sure to check them out if you are interested.

“The human being is the centre in all our projects", says Sofia Olandersson, a Ph.D candidate involved in the Hand project. The aims of the Hand project are to develop methods to examine muscles acting on the hand and to a better understanding of the dysfunctional hand in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases affecting joints and muscles. Hopefully this will create possibilities to a better understanding of disorders and environmental factors that may affect the musculature. Possible environmental factors may include nutrition, injuries and physical training. See also the presentation of PRODEA — Centre for product development within the network alliance Health Technique.
The Pain project also focuses on the human being. The team collaborates with other partners to develop methods to examine the function of pain sensitive nerves. In addition, this will open up possibilities to better diagnostic tools and new strategies for the treatment of pain.
The project Training focuses on training and elite athletes, in which the exercise efficiency and the effect on the immune system are being studied.
In all our research projects there is a close collaboration with researchers nationally and internationally. “This is essential", says Marita Hilliges, the research team leader. Studies of patients would not be possible without the collaboration with experienced clinicians. Our collaborations are a prerequisite for research at a high scientific level and give our research students possibilities to make international experiences.

Wind turbines and humans
Wind turbines produce renewable energy with low impact on the environment, but the planning process is often delayed by public objections based on fear of disturbances. Are people living in the vicinity of wind turbines affected by noise and shadows? If so, is this effect due to the exposure or to other factors influencing the variation in perceived annoyance?
Environmental effects of nitrogen deposition
The northern hemisphere receives large amounts of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen deposition. Beneficial effects that initially appear, e. g. increased forest production or decreased emissions of carbon dioxide from soils may turn into negative effects after long-term high deposition. Such negative effects are increased emissions of the greenhouse gas dinitrogen oxide and coastal water eutrophication. The possibilities to counteract negative effects are poorly known and are studied from regional and global perspectives.
Effects of nitrogen deposition on plants
Other effects of nitrogen deposition are increased concentrations of different nitrogenous compounds in forest trees and ground flora which may lead to changes in plant nutrient balance and in plant species composition. Plant species show differences in their sensitivity to high nitrogen deposition. Studies are made on forest edge effects and in areas near point sources of ammonia in order to find the limits for stable forest ecosystem functioning.
Environmental effects of use of biogas residue as fertilizer
Farm-scale anaerobic digestion produces, apart from gas, also a digested residue. Digestion of manure and agricultural residues produces a stabilised fertilizer with a more controlled nutrient release than regular manure. Thus, emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and nutrient leaching can be avoided. Studies are made on how different substrates and process conditions influence the quality of the digested residue, including nutritional and environmental aspects.
Effects of eutrophication on suspension feeders in Fucus communities in the south-east Kattegatt
Eutrophication has a negative impact on various suspension-feeding organisms. Further studies in this field may relieve a variety of shortterm- and longterm effects on the biodiversity in the coastal seaweed communities. These are important breeding and feeding areas for many species of fish and should be considered of major environmental interest.
Biodiversity, indicator species and morphological adaptations
Dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata) are used to detect changes in species richness in agricultural and forested areas in Sweden. Dragonflies are predators and their presence in aquatic habitats may indicate high diversity. Similar studies are performed in tropical environments: rain forests in Costa Rica and deserts in Namibia. In addition, morphological and ecological adaptations of these insects to different environments are studied in relation to their known phylogeny.

The research has a wide application range. General methods within research areas, such as signals analysis, statistics, physical metrology, and quantitative topography characterisation can be applied to support engineering applications. The applications vary from the automotive industry with manufacturing of low fuel- consumption engines, silent gear boxes, and complex car body panels, to manufacturing of dental implant surfaces and characterisation of artificial hip joint-implants for improved function and long product life.
The topic within the functional research group are by definition cross- and multi- disciplinary. PhD students and researchers from the University in Halmstad, Chalmers in Göteborg, Göteborg University, Linköping University, and Lund University co-operate and find partners within the mechanical- and biotechnical industry. Most of the financial support comes from the industrial branches mentioned and the governmental VINNOVA, as well as the national SSFand KK-foundations.
Focus for the research is to analyse surface topography and texture to enable detailed modelling of manufacturing and function of general surface applications.
The two main application areas: Automotive and Biotech, are organized in project areas; engine cylinder-liner and piston interactions, transmission surfaces, car body panel surfaces, and dental implant surfaces. Common for the automotive applications is the endeavour towards friction and wear control. Dental implant surfaces need to be correctly characterised for improved manufacturing quality and bone integration. The research in the Bio area is placed within the research platform/centre PRODEA.
The manufactured micro- and nanostructures on the titanium dental-implant screws (left picture) contribute significantly to a strong jaw-bone anchoring and possibilities for early, safe loading after the surgery.
When controlling the manufacturing of the micrometer-large criss-cross pattern of the cylinder liner walls of an internal combustion engine, the research group and its partners have the tools to significantly change the fuel- and oil consumption, with strong impact on the environment.

In a rare case of technology transfer into new research and development, the Photonics and Microwave group, with research in radio astronomy, at the University of Halmstad and MEFOS of Luleå are together developing new technologies for dynamically and in real-time measure multiple levels and off-gases in industrial processes. The development is close collaboration with Swedish and European steel and metal industries, in some cases within the frame works of the European Coal and Steel Collaboration (ECSC).
The research program includes:
* Three-dimensional imaging with microwaves. This project aims to develop a new fully 3-D imaging system which from a single vantage point will make a complete microwave holographic image of the burden surface of a blast-furnace.
* Analysis of off-gases. The project aims to analyze the molecular composition, concentration, and temperature of the off-gas from industrial and combustion processes. The analysis is made with a phase-coherent microwave spectrometer mounted across the duct channel.
* Tomographic imaging of fiber material. This project aims to make holographic images of fiber material, e.g. meat and wood, with coherent polarized microwave signals.

This process is unique for plants, algae and photosynthetic bacteria. In the mitochondrion, the cellular respiration takes place. In this process, common to both animals and plants, energy is recovered when energy-rich compounds (carbohydrates and fats) are degraded. Both photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complicated processes, which can be divided into many partial reactions. Despite the fact that photosynthesis may appear as the opposite of cellular respiration, the two processes do in fact share many similarities. One important similarity is that many of the enzymes involved are membrane proteins, integral components of biological membranes.
Most of the proteins in the organelles are synthesised outside the organelle and must be transported into it. They are synthesised with an extension called presequence, which functions as an "address tag". This tag is recognised by receptors on the surface of the organelle, and thereafter the protein is transported into the organelle. In plant cells, which have both chloroplasts and mitochondria, this process is more complicated than in animal cells. The presequences directing proteins to mitochondria and chloroplast are similar, but there are small differences that determine to which organelle the protein is directed.
We study the structure of these address tags, and how they are able to direct a protein to chloroplasts or mitochondria and also further within the organelle. As experimental organisms, we use higher plants, mostly pea and wheat, and the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas.
To map the mechanisms that regulate the transport of proteins to and within chloroplasts and mitochondria, we use isolated DNA clones encoding specific chloroplastic and mitochondrial proteins. Using the DNA clones as templates, we produce radioactively labelled proteins. These labelled proteins are mixed with isolated chloroplasts or mitochondria, or with purified membrane fractions. In this way, we can study the molecular mechanisms of protein/ membrane interactions. To study protein transport directly in living cells, a hybrid gene with a modified sorting signal has been constructed. When this gene is introduced in algal cells we will be able to compare the sorting of the modified protein and the original protein in the cells.

Flow-proportional water sampling. Variation in nutrient removal values between wetlands is very large, and removal values also vary between years for the same wetland, weakening modelling estimates on overall nutrient removal. We attempt to produce better data for modelling nutrient removal by applying flow-proportional water sampling in three agricultural wetlands in South Sweden. We intend to test if removal data from periods with different water flows can be used for modelling the removal capacity of individual wetlands.
An experimental wetland research facility with replicated wetland units. The experimental wetland research facility consists of 18 similarly shaped wetland units (mesocosms) in which water flow, water depth, and vegetation composition can be controlled individually. The number of wetland units makes replication of treatments possible, thus facilitating statistical evaluation of obtained results. Experiments are primarily performed to reveal which factors are most important to obtain a high nitrogen removal in wetlands. Important factors assessed in the experimental wetlands and assumed to be important for nitrogen removal are: hydraulic load, nitrogen load, temperature, water depth, and vegetation composition.
Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in wetlands. This project approaches the different impacts of species composition and diversity on magnitude and stability of ecosystem functioning. How are biodiversity and plant composition linked in constructed wetlands in the agricultural landscape? How is ecosystem functioning (specifically retention of phosphorus and nitrogen) linked to biodiversity and vegetation composition in these wetlands? How can ecosystem functioning and biodiversity be optimised in such wetlands? The answers will enable us to deliver concrete guidelines regarding wetland construction and management.

- West Boulder Canyon
- Pinnacles near first pass en route to Superstion Crest
- The Superstition Mountains are vast and rugged.
- Weaver’s Needle, the most celebrated sight in the Superstitions
- East, from the mouth of West Boulder Canyon
- Saguaro cacti at twilight
In the Canadian Rockies, winter is a malicious brute. And here he is again, barging back into our lives, obviously intending to stay a while and rough everybody up. For the next week, the forecasted high temperatures in Canmore and Banff are approximately -20°C. The lows will plunge to -30°C.
Even if winter isn’t quite so brutal where you live, we urge you to run for it. Because it’s surprisingly easy to escape. You don’t have to go far to find sunny skies, warm temperatures, and an abundance of hiking trails accessing exotic, spectacular wilderness.
Our recommended destination for winter hiking: Arizona’s Superstition Mountains, a mere 45-minute drive east of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. If you’re a keen hiker, the Superstitions are worth a two-week vacation.
“The Supes,” as we call them, comprise 160,000 acres (646 square km) of snow-free, desert mountains and canyons. Summers there are too hot to safely enjoy hiking. But late October through April, the days remain warm enough that you can often comfortably stride in shorts. We’ve backpacked in the Supes in January, when daytime temperatures averaged 21°C. After twilight, however, heat always dissipates rapidly in arid lands, so be prepared for freezing nights.
From Calgary or Vancouver, Westjet and US Air fly to Phoenix. Round-trip fares start at about $350. Within the States, US Air offers inexpensive fares to Phoenix. Renting a car at Sky Harbor might cost as little as $20 per day.
If you arrive in Phoenix in the morning, that afternoon you can begin sampling the Supe’s extensive trail network. You’ll hear the satisfying sound of gravel crunching beneath your boots. You’ll be surrounded by bizarre cacti: writhing ocotillo and statuesque saguaros. You’ll see monolithic cliffs, sharp pinnacles, plunging, boulder-strewn ravines. Tilt your head back, and you’ll likely be staring into a brilliant, blue sky. Not only will you see the sun, you’ll feel it massaging the muscles that just hours ago you’d held taut against the onslaught of winter. Only on weekends, on certain trails, might you encounter many Phoenicians. Tranquility reigns in the Supes.
Trails Illustrated Map 851 “Tonto NF Superstition and Four Peaks Wilderness Areas” is adequate for dayhiking. If backpacking, get the USGS 1:25 000 topos so you can pinpoint springs, which will be your only water sources.
These are our favorite hikes in the Supes:
Siphon Draw
Drive the Superstition Freeway, then Hwy 60, east to Apache Junction. Turn left (north) off Hwy 60 onto Idaho Road. Set your trip odometer to 0. In 0.6 mi (1 km) turn right onto Hwy 88. At 6.2 mi (10 km) turn right into Lost Dutchman State Park, at 2080 ft (634 m). This is a very appealing campground.
The trail leads to the mouth of Siphon Draw, where a steep route ascends 2470 ft (753 m), culminating at 4550 ft (1387 m) just below the summit of Flatiron where you’ll enjoy a vast, aerial panorama. Time it right, and you’ll see the sparkling lights of Phoenix on the western horizon while you descend.
LaBarge Creek / Boulder Canyon
Drive the Superstition Freeway, then Hwy 60, east to Apache Junction. Turn left (north) off Hwy 60 onto Idaho Road. Set your trip odometer to 0. In 0.6 mi (1 km) turn right onto beautiful, winding Hwy 88, known as the Apache Trail. Drive northeast 14.5 mi (23.3 km) to Canyon Lake. Park at the marina, then return to the trailhead opposite the marina entrance. The trail initially climbs above an arm of the lake, then enters a dramatic desertscape. Most people will want to return the same way rather than loop back northwest through boulder-strewn LaBarge Creek Canyon.
The trail climbs above La Barge Creek 1 mi (1.6 km) to a ridgecrest, then descends into LaBarge Creek drainage at 2.5 mi (4 km). Turn around anywhere along here for a fulfilling, half-day hike.
Strong hikers who examine the map will see they can continue south to 7 mi (11.3 km) where Trail 104 splits into east and west forks. Go right (west) briefly, then right (northwest) on Trail 241 to pass beneath Black Mesa. Loop right (northeast) on Trail 236 back to Battleship Mountain at 13 mi (21 km). Then rejoin the Boulder Canyon trail and you’re on familiar ground for the final 3.5 mi (5.6 km). Total circuit distance: 16.5 mi (26.6 km).
Fremont Saddle
From Idaho Road in Apache Junction, continue east 8.5 mi (13.7 km) on Hwy 60. Pass King Estates. Turn left (north) at the sign for Peralta Trailhead. Follow FS Road 77 (unpaved but graded) north 8 mi (13 km) to the trailhead at 2400 ft (732 m). This popular trail leads 2.5 mi (4 km) to 3766-ft (1150-m) Fremont Saddle and a startling view of the Supes’ most famous sight: Weaver’s Needle. Elevation gain to the saddle: 1440 ft (439 m).
Swift, eager hikers will continue, descending the far side of the saddle, proceeding northwest of the Needle to a junction at 5.5 mi (9 km). Go right (south, then southeast) beneath Black Top Mesa. At the 6.5-mi (10.5-km) junction, go right (south) on Trail 234 to 3410-ft (1040-m) Bluff Saddle. Bear right on Trail 235 in Barks Canyon to return to Peralta Trailhead. Total loop distance: 11.5 mi (18.5 km). Map: USGS Weavers Needle.
West Boulder Canyon to Siphon Draw via Superstition Crest
This 8- to 9- hour, one-way traverse is for athletic hikers who are competent, cross-country navigators and have either a second vehicle or a willing shuttle slave. The USGS topo maps Goldfield and Weavers Needle are required equipment for this long, highly scenic route linking the east end of the crest with Siphon Draw in the west. The distance, a mere 12 mi (19 km), sounds relatively easy but isn’t. Though the route is distinct the entire way, the terrain is rough, going astray is a constant possibility, significant ups and downs are frequent, and the elevation gain and loss totals about 5000 ft (1524 m).
In winter, it’s essential that you start hiking by 8 a.m. because the sun will set at approximately 5:30 p.m. If you think you’ll be too pressed by the limited daylight, consider hiking out and back. Start at the east-side trailhead and go only as far as the cluster of pinnacles on the ridge near 4300 ft (1311 m). Well before reaching the pinnacles, you’ll attain an impressive view of Weaver’s Needle. The ridge climaxes at 5057 ft (1541 m).
To reach the West Boulder Canyon trailhead, follow the above directions for Peralta Trailhead. About 1.2 mi (2 km) shy of Peralta, just before the road dips into a wash, park in the unsigned but obvious trailhead on the left.
Begin hiking the rocky road (chained to block vehicles) north-northeast. Ahead you’ll see two drainages. Your trail will ascend the one on the right. Soon reach a fence where you’ll pass through a hiker’s maze. About 1.5 hours from the trailhead, surmount a pass. Bear left here. The trail contours briefly. Do not descend right into West Boulder Canyon. Further directions should not be necessary if you have a compass, the topo maps, and the requisite experience.
Tortilla Flats / Upper LaBarge Box / Peters Mesa
For a superb two- or three-day backpack trip, drive Hwy 88 to Canyon Lake marina (described above for LaBarge Creek / Boulder Canyon). Set your trip odometer to 0. Continue past the tourist hamlet of Tortilla Flats. At 8.6 mi (13.8 km), immediately after milepost 221, reach Tortilla Flats trailhead on the right.
Ascend FS Road 213—a rough, 4WD route best traveled on foot. Gain 350 ft (107 m) to a pass. Follow the road southeast, descending 200 ft (61 m) to the wilderness boundary at 3.2 mi (5.2 km). You’ll pass a windmill and watering hole. Hike the JF Trail 0.75 mi (1.3 km) southeast on a rocky hill to a junction. Turn right onto Hoolie Bacon Trail 111.
At 8.5 mi (13.7 km) reach the east side of Upper La Barge Box and possible campsites. Exit the west side of the Box at 10.25 mi (16.5 km). At the junction with Whiskey Spring Canyon, go right (northwest) toward Music Canyon. Another good campsite is at 13.5 mi (21.7 km), near Charlebois Spring. Go right on Trail 105 over Peters Mesa, then generally northeast via Kane Spring to Tortilla Flats trailhead. Total loop distance: 20.5 mi (33 km).
Further Information
There are several guidebooks on the Superstitions. None is exceptional. All will suffice. In addition to describing the trails, they explain the intriguing legend of the Lost Dutchman Mine. Supposedly, enough gold to finance a life of luxury awaits you at the tip of the Weaver’s Needle shadow. Precisely where the gold is buried along the arc of the shadow is the question that remains unanswered.
Nice site. There’s some good information on here. I’ll be checking back regularly.

By Noam Weinblatt Hillel presented eight exceptional Hillel professionals with its Richard M. Joel Exemplar of Excellence Award for their outstanding commitment to fulfilling Hillel’s mission of service to Jewish students around the globe. The awards were given at Hillel Institute, a conference of Hillel professionals held at Washington University in St. Louis, August 10-13.
“These Exemplars are in various stages of their careers, hold different positions and hail from a variety of Hillels and communities,” says Hillel President Wayne L. Firestone. “They are all committed to enriching the lives of our students and ensuring that every facet of Hillel reflects a culture of excellence.”
The award, named in honor of former Hillel President Richard M. Joel, is presented to individuals who emulate Joel’s devotion to professionalism, extraordinary faithfulness to Jewish principles, a profound interest in the welfare of friends and colleagues, and a passion for connecting new generations to the joy of Jewish living.
The exemplars are:
Marni Blitz, Assistant Director at Princeton HillelBlitz understands that meaningful Jewish experiences and developing relationships go hand in hand. Her passion for Judaism is genuinely inspiring. Students appreciate her warmth and enthusiasm. Blitz’s supervisor said, “Marni is a true thought partner who balances strategic insight with practical wisdom, helping to envision future directions while recommending a reasonable pace for growth and new initiatives.”
Shana Teig Kantor, Executive Director at Hillel BinghamtonAn experienced Hillel professional, Kantor brings a strategic approach to Hillel’s work, figuring out how to engage more students with fewer resources. Her vision has led to an explosion of participation in the Hillel’s Freshman Orientation, expanding the impact Hillel has on students from the moment they step on campus. Kantor has demonstrated how to balance the demands of a growing family and an expanding campus program. Even the Binghamton’s vice president of student affairs said, “Shana’s efforts distinguish Hillel among student organizations by its deep and enduring commitment to community service,” adding that he “frequently consults with Kantor to help develop the university’s own alternative breaks.”
Sheila Katz, Assistant Director for Jewish Student Life at North Carolina HillelKatz is a natural bridge builder with infectious enthusiasm, compassion and charisma. She is strongly committed to the values and growth of Hillel, not just in her local environment, but also more broadly for the field. When presented with a critical need for program processionals, she helped organize a grassroots initiative to address the problem. A colleague wrote that Katz “is profoundly sensitive to the power of language and non-verbal cues that welcome or alienate students.” From a diverse Jewish journey that included years teaching through Teach for America, Katz draws on past experience to continue to be innovative in her work.
Rabbi Adam Naftalin-Kelman, Executive Director at Berkeley HillelRabbi Naftalin-Kelman is a humble leader who inspires others to act positively through compassion, kindness and poise. He believes in the importance of strategic and authentic relationships on campus and in the community that can lead to positive and constructive dialogue. Colleagues have said that he is insightful, intellectual and innovative, managing complex situations while also advancing Hillel’s engagement efforts through the development of meaningful relationships. His campus was recognized by the Israel on Campus Coalition for its work in preventing a passage of an anti-Israel divestment resolution.
Rabbi David Komerofsky, Executive Director at Texas Hillel FoundationVision, humor, and generosity of spirit are at the core of Komerofsky’s efforts to energize Hillel. He has been able to balance the needs of a large state university Hillel and to give it a new fresh identity. As someone who understands true partnership, Komerofsky continues to explore how to diversify Hillel’s funding sources. He is able to balance the ebb and flow of making difficult decisions while maintaining a sense of joy and humor in any situation. As a result of his leadership, every Taglit-Birthright returnee receives contact from Hillel within five days of returning to campus, inviting them to share what has been exciting and challenging about their “reentry” into campus life.
Rabbi Danielle Leshaw, Rabbi and Director at Ohio University HillelRabbi Leshaw harnesses every possible resource to ensure that Hillel engages students in breadth and depth. With a strong commitment to Israel, she is already preparing plans for a unique immersive experience in summer 2011. Despite having only 600 Jewish students on campus, Rabbi Leshaw continues to mentor Peer Network interns which engaged nearly 200 students this past academic year. She is well respected by her local Jewish community and across North America for giving a strong voice to small and mighty Hillels.
Rabbi Dan Smokler, Senior Jewish Educator at the Edgar Bronfman Center for Jewish Life at NYUAt the beginning of his Hillel career, Rabbi Smokler pioneered a new methodology of engagement, bringing Torah to life, on several small and mighty campuses. Since then, he has become a magnet for Jewish life, continually adapting to the changing environment of the college campus. Rabbi Smokler understands what it means to build networks and micro-communities. In interactions with students, he is careful to not shy away from difficult questions while still allowing students to steer the conversations. A colleague noted that Rabbi Smokler loves to provoke and challenge while simultaneously setting the stage for safe and open dialogue. Rabbi Smokler was recently featured in the largest Jewish newspaper in North America for creating a conference of scholars to discuss the creation of a unique field of Jewish education for emerging adults.
Olga Tovkach, Director at Dnepropetrovsk HillelTovkach is a genuine model for others to learn and grow. She has an uncanny ability to relate to others and is wonderful at welcoming students, new and old. A professional who has transformed Hillel to become a center for Jewish life on campus, Tovkach focuses on preserving the past while looking toward the future. One colleague noted that she harmoniously combines creativity with rationalism, a big vision with punctuality in details. Always looking to lead and develop staff, Tovkach creates professional development opportunities through scheduling regular learning sessions and other educational opportunities.Noam Weinblatt is a Hillel communications intern and a rising junior at the University of Maryland, College Park.Reprinted by permission from the St. Louis Jewish Light.See also:

Dec 13 2012 by Emma Ray, Hinckley Times
A NEW building contractor has been given the job of rescuing Hinckley’s multi-million pound council offices scheme which hit the buffers after its previous building contractor went into liquidation.
Rugby-based Stepnell has been selected as the new building contractor to complete the construction of the Hinckley Hub civic offices, based on the corner of Hawley Road and Rugby Road.
The council’s development partners MRP and Aviva selected Stepnell after the original building contractor, Hallam Contracts, of Oadby, went into administration at the end of last month with the loss of 100 jobs.
Council bosses say Stepnell will be taking on full liability for all aspects of the construction, including that carried out by Hallam and key sub-contractors, many of whom are local to Leicestershire, will be retained.
Work stopped on the Hinckley Hub three weeks ago after the firm went into receivership but council chiefs say work will start again before Christmas and is set to be completed by the end of April. Council services and other partners will begin the relocation into Hinckley Hub shortly afterwards.
Councillor Keith Lynch, Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council’s executive member for finance, ICT and asset management, said “While it is regrettable that Hallam has gone into administration, I am absolutely delighted that our development partner MRP, with the support of their funding partner Aviva, have turned the situation around so quickly and have chosen Stepnell as the new contractor. Although there will inevitably be some delay in completing the building, this is not significant, given the circumstances. I can once again confirm that, because of the contractual and funding arrangements negotiated by senior officers under direction of the administration, the council has not incurred any financial costs from this unfortunate situation.”
Richard Anderson, director of MRP, said “Hallam Contracts were an excellent contractor on this project. We were very saddened that they were unable to survive a tough economic climate for construction companies. Stepnell have shown a strong interest in completing the job and their professionalism is demonstrated by the amount of due diligence they have undertaken in a short space of time. This has enabled them to assume full liability for the project. Stepnell’s financial position is very strong and this is obviously important to ourselves, the council and Aviva in view of what has happened.
“We look forward to working with them to complete this important regeneration project for the town of Hinckley.”
Mark Wakeford, managing director of Stepnell, has met with senior officers of the council and anticipated a start on site before Christmas, with the full workforce on site in the New Year.
He added: “We are able to re-commence works on site and take over all warranties with confidence on the basis that Hallam have carried out works to the highest standards. I look forward to working with MRP and completing this iconic building.”
Hallam Contracts had been working on the £12 million project to build new headquarters for Hinckley and Bosworth for the last 10 months.
Once completed the 41,000 square feet office development will house staff of the borough council, allowing it to vacate its current accommodation in Argents Mead and at St Florence House. It will also provide office space for other partner organisations.

translation is very nice and can be understood easily.thanks
THANKS I AM CHANTING IT FOR LONG TIME.. THANKS FOR THE TRANSLATIONS
But this sanskrit verse seems to narrate the conversation between Agastya and Rama about Adutya Hridhyam. But where is Aditya hridhyam which Rama recited?
Criticalmass...could please clarify what you mean
Abhilash, In my understanding, this verse narrates the converstaion between Agastya Rishi and Rama.
Agastya Rishi speakes to Rama from stanza 3 to stanza 27 and praises the Sun God and advises Rama to recite Aditya Hridhyam.But which Hymn did Rama recite as mentioned in stanza 28?
Am I clear now?
Ok i feel the particular prayer you wants starts from Stanza 6 and ends in Stanza 24. But as far as i know chanting of Aditya Hridayam means chanting these 31 stanzas.
Hey,
Wonderful job! Thanks for the verses in English., ppl like me can chant it. and translation is also very useful.
ThanQ!
This is one of the powerful 'mantra' of all time... I have personally benifitted from this. To get the full benefit of this 'mantra', one should recite it at the time of sunrise (strictly after bath).
Reciting Gayatri Mantra before Aditya Hridayam gives the complete benefit.
-Thank you.
Dhananjaya
Very nice and precise explanations, it is always better to understand and say Slokas; But why is that it is said we have to say this slokam during the day times only? That too specifically during Sunrise or Sunset.
Thanks
Many thanks Abhilash...

Best Regards, Kumar

The state goes to the polls on December 13 and 17. The result will be out on December 20. Read the Sankalp Patra
Releasing the BJP manifesto on Monday, Modi promised five million houses to the “neo middle-class” — those who have beaten poverty but still need government’s help to stay afloat.
In a rapidly urbanising Gujarat, where about 42% of the population lives in urban areas, it is a fetching proposal that also aims to neutralise a similar pledge made by the Congress in September.
The BJP manifesto “has been copied from Gujarat Congress' 12-points Gujarat development declaration…” said the Congress, describing Modi as a copycat.
The opposition is doing its bit to deny Modi, who is contesting from Maninagar segment. Keshubhai Patel's Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP) Monday withdrew its candidate in support of Congress's Shweta Bhatt, wife of suspended IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt. Shweta had Sunday urged all parties to together take on the CM.
“We have decided to withdraw our candidate and asked all our workers and activists to extend their support to her,” GPP vice-president Suresh Mehta said.
While the opposition closed ranks, BJP leadership continued to hail the 62-year-old as the best CM. “Modi is undertaking great development work in Gujarat. He is a role model for chief ministers of other states on how to rule, govern and take care of even the poorest,” party veteran LK Advani said at a public meeting in Mansa town of Gandhinagar district. But unlike party colleague Sushma Swaraj, Advani, known to nurse an ambition for the top post, stopped short of endorsing the Gujarat CM as the only candidate for the Prime Minister's post.

Saif is the great-grandson of the last Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan, whose daughter Sajida Sultan was married to Iftekhar Ali Khan Pataudi. Their son Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (Saif's father) had inherited the title of Nawab of Pataudi from his father's side and Bhopal from his mother's side.
Those who have received invites from Bhopal include entrepreneur Sikander Hafiz Khan of the Reliable Group, hotelier and relative Nadir Rashid, family friend and corporator in Bhopal Municipal Corporation Mahira Salamuddin, 'Tiger' Pataudi's friend and fellow bridge-player Rasdeep Singh, family member Nasir Mirza, writer Sikandar Malik and ADC to Pataudi Anwar Mohammed Khan.
"The family has invited those who have been close to them. I think since it is a high-profile wedding, they have restricted the guest list to a minimum. I'm sure they would have wanted to call many more people," says Mahira Salamuddin.
While the residents of Bhopal were not really expecting a grand reception, there is, however, a certain disappointment at receiving yet another cold shoulder from its erstwhile rulers. After Pataudi's death last year, Saif held a pugree ceremony in Pataudi to accept the title of Nawab, but did not hold a similar ceremony in Bhopal. "Though 'Tiger' Pataudi spent a substantial amount of time in Bhopal right from his childhood, the circle of friends he had here was very limited. I suppose that is the reason for the family not inviting many people for the wedding. One could also say that they were slightly disconnected from Bhopal," says Shamshul Hassan Arif, owner of the Urdu newspaper Nadeem.
"The family is not very keen to maintain any ties with Bhopal or else they would have invited many people. Late Tiger Pataudi had attended numerous weddings of relatives in Bhopal and if the family was keen they would have reciprocated," says Syed Akhtar Husain, author of the Royal Journey of Bhopal, a book on the princely family of Bhopal.
The walima is being held on October 18 at Aurangzeb Road in Delhi.

"Yes, the note to EGoM has been withdrawn," a top ministry official said.
This was done in view of panel haded by Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council Chairman C Rangarajan being asked to suggest "structure and elements of the guidelines for determining the basis or formula for the price of domestically produced gas, and for monitoring actual price fixation."
Prime Minister had appointed the six-member panel to essentially look at the design of future contracts for exploration of of oil and gas. It had also been tasked to suggest pricing of natural gas.
Sources said the Ministry had in the October 10 note to EGoM members argued that a higher price of KG-D6 gas would result in $6.3 billion rise in subsidy burden. $6.3 billion.
The ministry, however, in the note did not state that RIL had modified its January request for a price revision to clearly state it is seeking rate revision only from April 1, 2014 when the current price is due to expire.
RIL first in June and then again on September 6 reiterated its demand for a price at par with the rate India is paying for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from April 1, 2014 when the current five-year period of $4.2 price expires.
It wants to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67%.
Its CBM pricing formula as well as Essar Oil's demand for $4.2 per mmBtu price of CBM from its Raniganj block in West Bengal had been referred Rangarajan for review.

The turf war between rival drug trafficking groups has spread terror in the state of Nayarit. For some time things have been quiet but the violence appears to not have an end in sight.
Yesterday at approximately 10:00 pm, the Puente de Los Lobos located near Mazatlan, was again the scene of a gruesome discovery, this time a young man was hung in place and hundreds of people were able to witness the event.
The hook was tied to the feet, and he was wearing only boxers. Immediately, elements of different police forces came to rescue the body. The maneuvers took a few minutes, while people were watching.
Staff from the Medical Examiner, moved the body to its facilities to perform the autopsy by law.

Photo: low-skill jobs
A new report for the Migration Policy Institute states that despite what many have said in regards to the benefits of only highly skilled immigrants, it is just as important to the economy to have low-skilled immigrants as well.
Though economists are still arguing over the costs and benefits of less-skilled immigrants, the report Immigration Policy and Less-Skilled Workers in the United States: Reflections on Future Directions for Reform, Professor Harry Holzer of the Georgetown Public Policy Institutes states that he found that the benefits of low-skilled immigrants mostly go to the employers who get to pay the workers lower wages, but the benefits also reach both higher and lower-income consumers, as they both purchase the goods and/or services produced by the lower skilled workers.
The negative aspect of these lower skilled workers is seen amongst U.S.-born low-skilled workers and immigrants who come to the country earlier, as they must compete over the low-skill jobs with new immigrants coming in. However, Holzer, a former chief economist for the Labor Department said that this negative aspect is relatively modest, and the positive still far surpasses it.
“Even the most negative estimates of the impacts of less-skilled immigrants on U.S. workers in similar jobs suggest that in the long run, immigration accounts for only a small share of the deterioration observed in less-skilled Americans’ employment and earnings,” said Holzer.
Holzer argued that an “optimal level” of less-skilled immigration is too complex to determine, but gave suggestions on how to modify immigration policy to increase the benefits of such workers.
· Providing pathways to legal status and citizenship for low-skilled workers already here, and a legal route for future workers by using provisional visas that make it possible for some temporary workers to become permanent residents.
· Allowing less-skilled workers on employment-based visas to switch employers more easily and gain a path to citizenship.
· Setting employer visa fees at a level sufficient to offset some of the costs that low-skilled immigration imposes.
· Ensuring flexibility in the numbers admitted so that flows can respond to employer demand and macroeconomic conditions.

Mark Sanchez and Tim Tebow often have talked about how
they have become fast friends off the field despite the Jets'
unusual situation at quarterback.
But maybe their communication on the field could be a little better.
On third-and-3 from the Jets' 27 in the third quarter of their eventual 23-20 overtime victory against Miami, Sanchez tried to throw to Tebow in the right flat. The ball went off Tebow's helmet when he failed to turn around in time.
"I was not expecting it that quick," Tebow said, "but I guess I'll learn."
However, Sanchez blamed himself.
"It probably wasn't the best read," he said. "I think they covered it better than I thought. Going through it in my head, probably not the best read."
It was one of 11 plays during the game in which Tebow and Sanchez were on the field at the same time. Tebow also had three snaps as a Wildcat quarterback.
"I was in a lot of different places, all over the place," Tebow said, "trying to give [the Dolphins] a lot of different looks. We didn't know how they'd play it. We were in the huddle, and they'd see both of us [quarterbacks] or they'd see one of us. ... It was just a little game-planning."
But Tebow's tangible contribution came in his other role as personal punt protector. On fourth-and-3 from the Jets' 25 in the second quarter, the Jets faked a punt for the first time this season. Tebow bulled 5 yards for a first down and the drive eventually resulted in a field goal.
"It's definitely gratifying," Tebow said. "I was hoping we'd run another one later in the game, but they were playing it safe the whole game."
Special teams coordinator Mike Westhoff said it was a "special formation" and that Tebow had the option to check out of it if the Dolphins had lined up in a formation unfavorable to the Jets' chances.
And it likely won't be the last fake, as Westhoff made clear.
"I'll come up with something else before I get back to New York, I promise you," he said before leaving the stadium.

On March 17, 1901, paintings by the late Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh are shown at the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in Paris. The 71 paintings, which captured their subjects in bold brushstrokes and expressive colors, caused a sensation across the art world. Eleven years before, while living in Auvers-sur-Oise outside Paris, van Gogh had committed suicide without any notion that his work was destined to win acclaim beyond his wildest dreams. In his lifetime, he had sold only one painting. One of his paintings--the Yasuda Sunflowers--sold for just under $40 million at a Christie's auction in 1987.
Born in Zundert in the Netherlands in 1853, van Gogh worked as a salesman in an art gallery, a language teacher, a bookseller, and an evangelist among Belgium miners before settling on his true vocation as an artist. What is known as the "productive decade" began in 1880, and for the first few years he confined himself almost entirely to drawings and watercolors while acquiring technical proficiency. He studied drawing at the Brussels Academy and in 1881 went to the Netherlands to work from nature. The most famous work from the Dutch period was the dark and earthy The Potato Eaters (1885), which showed the influence of Jean-Francois Millet, a French painter famous for his peasant subjects.
In 1886, van Gogh went to live with his brother, Theo, in Paris. There, van Gogh met the foremost French painters of the postimpressionist period, including Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, Camille Pissarro, and Georges Seurat. He was greatly influenced by the theories of these artists and under the advice of Pissarro he adopted the kind of colorful palette for which he is famous. His painting Portrait of Pere Tanguy (1887) was the first successful work in his new postimpressionist style.
In 1888, van Gogh, mentally exhausted and feeling he was becoming a burden on Theo, left Paris and took a house at Arles in southeastern France. The next 12 months marked his first great period, and working with great speed and intensity he produced such masterful works as his sunflower series and The Night Cafe (1888). He hoped to form a community of like-minded artists at Arles and was joined by Gauguin for a tense two months that culminated when van Gogh threatened Gauguin with a razor blade and then cut a piece of his own ear off. It was his first bout with mental illness, diagnosed as dementia.
Van Gogh spent two weeks at the Arles Hospital and in April 1889 checked himself into the asylum at Saint-Remy-de-Provence. He stayed there for 12 months and continued to work between recurrent attacks. One of the great paintings from this period was the swirling, visionary Starry Night (1889). In May 1890, he left the asylum and visited Theo in Paris before going to live with Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, a homeopathic doctor and friend of Pissarro, at Auvers-sur-Oise. He worked enthusiastically for several months, but his mental and emotional state soon deteriorated. In late July 1890, feeling that he was a burden on Theo and others, he shot himself. He died two days later, on July 29, in the arms of his brother.
He had exhibited a few canvases at the Salon des Independants in Paris and in Brussels, and after his death both salons showed small commemorative exhibits of his work. Over the next decade, a handful of other van Gogh exhibits took place, but it was not until the Bernheim-Jeune show in 1901 that he was recognized as a truly important painter. In subsequent decades, his fame grew exponentially, and today his paintings are among the most recognized works of art in the world.

Japan
Introduction:
The Department encourages highly qualified applicants in modern Japanese history. Successful applicants are expected to have excellent undergraduate educations as evidenced by GPA, GRE scores, letters of recommendation and, when appropriate, samples of historical research. In addition, students should have a firm start (three years) in the Japanese language.
Prospective students are encouraged to consider those areas in which the Department's faculty are particularly suited to training, and should consult the faculty web pages for examples of our faculty’s scholarship. Associate Professor William Marotti currently acts as field coordinator; his specialization is in broadly-construed cultural history, with an emphasis on the post-WWII era (and a related interest in global history and critical social theory). Professor Herman Ooms, an expert on early modern or Tokugawa intellectual, social and legal history, with additional expertise in Nara-period politics and ideology, and critical social theory, will be retiring at the end of 2012 from full-time teaching. While he is not taking new students, we expect him to continue to offer an albeit reduced set of courses over the next several years. We hope to commence a search for a new faculty member for the Japan field shortly.
The study of Japanese history at UCLA is enhanced by the existence of strong programs in a variety of related fields both within the department and across the university. We work closely with colleagues in Chinese history, and with our excellent program of Korean studies in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures (which also includes numerous specialists in Japanese and Chinese history, language, and culture.) Japan specialists are also featured in the faculty of the departments of Anthropology, Art History, Geography, and Political Science (to name but a few; a more complete list may be found on the Terasaki Center for Japanese Studies’ website).
UCLA’s Terasaki Center for Japanese Studies greatly enhances the intellectual climate by sponsoring visiting professors, workshops, conferences, and research projects in all areas of Japanese history, society and culture. It also provides fellowships and research assistantships to graduate students on a competitive basis at all levels of their training.
Foreign Language Requirements:
For the M.A. degree, two years of Japan.

It was bitter cold with a foot of snow on the ground and no moonlight the night of January 24, 1945, as the green GIs of the 42nd 'Rainbow Division's 222nd Infantry Regiment strained to see the enemy. But a low ground fog covering the firebreak between their positions in the Ohlungen Forest and the Haguenau Forest before them made this an almost useless exercise. More chillingly, they could hear sounds from the woods beyond, sounds of tramping feet and loud talking. Water turned to ice in the bottoms of their foxholes. Anxiety built as they waited for the unseen enemy to come swarming out of the woods.
By January 1945, Adolf Hitler's Ardennes offensive was faltering, and in a last-ditch effort to break through Allied lines, the Führer scraped together what forces he could to launch an offensive into Alsace. Earlier German attacks in the area had created two small salients above and below Strasbourg and had forced the U.S. Seventh Army back on an arm that pivoted on Bischwiller, not far from the Rhine River, and extended northwest along the Moder River.
German plans called for a pincer movement to be launched from each of these two salients. It was hoped that this attack would either cut off Haguenau northeast of the Moder, or so seriously threaten it that the Americans in the city would withdraw back to open country, where the panzers could make quick work of them. In order to cut off Haguenau, however, the Germans would have to destroy American positions in the Ohlungen Forest. Poised to strike the 222nd were elements of the 25th Panzergrenadier, 47th Volksgrenadier and 7th Fallschirmjäger divisions.
The 42nd Division had arrived in France only a week before and was just becoming acclimated to combat conditions. Some of the 222nd's companies had fought in a few small engagements, but the bulk of the regiment's men were untried. After withdrawing behind the Moder on January 21, the regiment's commander, Colonel Henry L. Luongo, had spread his men along five defensive positions. From west to east, these were: a series of low hills on the left of the line, the town of Neubourg, the Mill d'Uhrbruck, the edge of the Ohlungen Forest where it formed an arc opposite the Moder's entry point into the Haguenau Forest, and finally, the town of Schweighausen on the right flank of the regimental front. By the evening of the 24th Luongo's men were as ready as they could be.
The Germans made no secret of their preparations as they hollered to each other in tones that to the scared GIs sounded half drunk. This particular portion of the forest stretched in an arc overlooking a suspected German bridging site. The left-flank squad of Company F prepared to give covering fire to its left supporting the 1st Platoon of Company E, which was dug in around the base of the arc.
At 1800, German artillery fire hit Schweighausen, then Neubourg. It eventually spread to the entire length of the regiment's line. At Neubourg and on Company K's front, the Germans threw not only artillery shells but also Nebelwerfer rockets that cut low, flaming trails through the fog. This fire continued relentlessly for an hour and a half, then slackened. Veterans later recalled that the night was filled with periods, often 20 minutes long, of intense artillery barrages. Despite the darkness, the German artillery fire, which had been preregistered on important points along the line, was very effective. Major Donald J. Downard, the 2nd Battalion's commander, moved his command post (CP) to a cellar at 1930, and at 2146 Major Walter J. Fellenz reported to Luongo that his 1st Battalion CP had taken a direct hit. Against this barrage, the 222nd's supporting artillery was unable to respond because darkness and woods prevented observation. During the first hour of the barrage almost all the regiment's phone lines were knocked out and their radios proved to be ineffective in the woods.
At about 2015, the men of Company E heard the Germans advancing toward the firebreak, shouting as they ran. Sergeant Arthur Innes' heavy machine gun on the western end of the arc of woods, and that of Sergeant John Murch on the eastern end, fired at the Germans as they came out of the forest. Sergeant John O'Laughlin poured mortar shells on them, and Sergeant Charles Hunt, with a light machine gun, shot down the few who got as far as the firebreak. Company E's commander, Lieutenant George A. Carroll, quickly moved his supporting platoon up a previously reconnoitered trail to positions below the arc. The reinforcements' firepower, combined with that of the platoon already in position, was overwhelming. A half hour of this punishment was enough for the Germans, and they pulled back to the safety of the Haguenau Forest.
The men of Company E, however, had little time to catch their breath. At 2045 Panzergrenadiers struck with force at the Mill d'Uhrbruck. Swarming past the mill and into the woods, they began to advance up a knoll to the southeast, where Company E had its mortar and machine-gun strongpoint. Although the Company E men killed dozens of Germans, they were quickly overwhelmed. Lieutenant Richard B. Break gathered men from the right, where the pressure had eased up, and led them in a counterattack to save the men at the strongpoint. Break's force was thrown back three times. By this time the Germans had taken control of the mill and the knolls behind it and were pouring into the woods beyond.
Company K's right flank was hit even harder. Lieutenant John Berg, leader of the 2nd Platoon on the company's right, went back through the mounting artillery barrage to report to the company CP. He was never heard from again. Sergeant Chambers, now in charge of the platoon, redistributed what ammunition remained. He was left with only 22 men to defend this important sector. Lieutenant Wilson C. Harper sent over three men from his 3rd Platoon to help Chambers. At the height of the artillery barrage, the desperate sergeant phoned for additional reinforcements and ammunition, saying they could not hold out much longer. Soon after he called, the line went dead.
A full company of Germans who came in under cover of an artillery and mortar barrage attacked the GIs in foxholes near the mill. When the artillery started to lift, the 2nd Platoon was struck first on the flanks and then in the center. The Germans overran several foxholes and the two light machine guns on the right. Noting their silence, Chambers sent a runner back to the company CP with a call for help and then pulled his men back from the woods' edge to the road. There they tried to form a skirmish line but were unsuccessful.
Chambers decided to fall back to the CP, get reinforcements and then counterattack. The few remaining GIs crawled westward in the road ditch. When heavy fire came from their front, they tried to move back eastward but ran into additional fire. They then made a torturous and painfully slow withdrawal through the woods to the southwest, through ever-increasing numbers of Germans. Eventually they made it out of the woods to Uhlweller and then back to the company CP at Neubourg. They left behind 11 men who were either killed or taken prisoner.
Although Chambers' decision to withdraw had left a gap in the line, he had little choice, with only 10 men and almost no ammunition, no mortar or machine-gun support and no communications with his company CP or other friendly units. As Chambers and the 2nd Platoon pulled back, they were unaware that Company K was trying to assist them. Harper knew that the three men he had sent over earlier were inadequate, and soon after the attack started he took six more and headed off in the direction of the 2nd Platoon. The six reinforcements, however, could not find the 2nd Platoon, so they returned to their CP.
After the phone lines went out, Lieutenant Carlyle Woelfer, commander of Company K, went to find out for himself what was happening on his right flank and, if possible, to regain contact with Company E. With Staff Sgt. Daniel A. Towse and Pfc Edmund C. Sheppard, he set out from the CP in a jeep pulling a trailer loaded with ammunition. Shortly after starting, the jeep broke down and their radio set went dead, so the men proceeded on foot.
When they reached the 1st Platoon, they found an intense firefight in progress between GIs and Volksgrenadiers who were threatening to advance from a grove in the middle of the firebreak. Mortar fire from the sand pit and Company M machine-gun fire prevented their advance.
During the heaviest artillery barrage, Lieutenant Otto Yanke, commanding Company M's heavy machine-gun platoon, had gone out into the firebreak to repair and move the phone wires that ran between the two guns covering the grove. Yanke kept control of his platoon throughout the fight with the Germans. He was constantly on the move from one gun to the other giving orders and calming nerves. He kept the easternmost gun in position throughout the night, even when the riflemen to its right had withdrawn. He pulled his third gun from the edge of the woods and placed it where it could fire down the road to the east should the Germans try to move on Neubourg from that direction.
Meanwhile, Woelfer sent a runner back to the battalion CP with the report that Neubourg and Company K's left were still intact. The lieutenant was fortunate enough to find an M8 Greyhound armored car of the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion on the outskirts of Neubourg. He commandeered it and, along with Towse and Sheppard, started down the road eastward. As they came into the area the 2nd Platoon had abandoned, they ran into a volley of small-arms fire, and replied with machine-gun fire. Then Woelfer called out in German, promising to cease firing. One German, reportedly a company commander, stepped forward and surrendered. He had with him maps that revealed details of the German plan.
When they had gone another 300 yards down the road, they saw a German machine-gun squad crawling up a furrow toward the left side of the road, trying to get into position to fire. Woelfer and Towse shot four. Two others came forward with their hands up.
Moving 200 yards farther down the road they came under fire from another machine-gun nest on the right side of the road. The two prisoners on the M8 began to wave their arms as if signaling to their comrades. Woelfer called out to the Germans in the woods to come out and surrender but received no reply. Then he threw a grenade in front of the machine-gun nest, but its occupants still said nothing, nor did they fire, so Woelfer and Sheppard went in after them, Sheppard going to the left, Woelfer to the right. As Woelfer came up on a little rise behind the gun, lifting his submachine gun to fire, he saw Sheppard suddenly appear in front of the German gun, saw him raise his rifle, heard the report as the Germans fired and saw Sheppard fall–killed instantly. Woelfer then set upon the Germans with his submachine gun, killing the three-man crew.
By now the M8 was out of ammunition and one of its tires was flat. Woelfer and his little group found that the woods where the 2nd Platoon had been were now full of Germans and that there was no hope of getting through to Company E. But from the sound of firing, they knew that fighting was still going on somewhere to the east. Just before midnight, they headed back toward Neubourg to organize a detachment to reinforce the flank they had found so badly battered.
Shortly after their penetration at the Mill d'Uhrbruck, the Germans struck again, this time on the right flank of Company E. Although the tiny American force was able to kill many of them, the company had already shifted much of its strength to meet the counterattack on its left, which weakened the squad holding the company's right flank. The Germans took advantage of this weakness, broke through the firebreak and entered the woods beyond.
Staff Sergeant Arthur Jones, manning the heavy machine gun on the left end of the arc of woods, used up five boxes of ammunition before his gun jammed. As he was attempting to clear it, several Germans attacked his dugout, forcing him and his men to retreat. They eventually were able to fight their way back toward Schweighausen. Sergeant John Munch and his crew on the right end of the arc fired 18 boxes of ammunition before they, too, had to withdraw. Soon afterward, Lieutenant Merrill, commanding the 2nd Platoon, Company F, withdrew those men he could to the outskirts of Schweighausen to regroup for a counterattack on the Ohlungen Forest, which was now full of Germans. The six men of Merrill's left flank squad were overrun and never heard from again.
The middle of the 222nd's line had been broken. Company E was entirely cut off. Company K's right and F's left were badly beaten up, and communications were out. Of the 55 men who had made up the three platoons in the area of the attack only hours before, three had been killed, 25 were missing (either captured or dead) and six were wounded. Sergeant Decaline of Company E, whose arm had been torn by shrapnel, was sent back to Ohlungen.
At about 0230, as the men despaired of ever receiving help, Lieutenant George Carroll decided that holding Company E's present position was hopeless. The Germans seemed to have forgotten about them as they moved on farther into the woods, and Carroll took advantage of this lull to lead his men, about half the original company, back through the woods to the south. In two groups they made their way back to Ohlungen, fighting off Germans as they went. Company E had no further role in the battle.
For the rest of the night, the 222nd fought to contain the breakthrough. The right of the line, at Schweighausen, continued to hold. The strongest pressure on the town came from the west as German paratroopers moved up through the Haguenau Forest and came down through the wedge that had been driven between Companies E and F.
After the 2nd Platoon had been pulled back, Captain Al Truscott of Company H sent 2nd Lt. Klare Moyer, with a heavy weapons platoon, into the neck of the woods to re-establish the line. Twice they pushed 100 yards into the woods, but both times were forced to withdraw. Then Lieutenant Merrill, having reorganized his platoon and gathered all the extra men that Company F could spare, set out to clear part of the neck of woods north of the Neubourg-Schweighausen road. There they ran into heavy fire. Two men were killed, one missing and several wounded. When German artillery zeroed in on them, they withdrew back to the town. It was quiet until daylight, the Germans having been slowed down not only by Lieutenants Moyer's and Merrill's counterattacks, but also by Company G striking from the south.
Sergeant Decaline, sent back earlier to the battalion aid station, had gone first to the battalion CP and reported the news of Company E's plight. Major Downard, seeing how excited Decaline was and the seriousness of his wounds, discounted his report but decided to send Company G, in reserve, to close the gap and re-establish the line. He ordered Captain Jere F. Palmes, Company G commander, to take his men up through the forest, follow the creek that cut across its southeastern corner, cross the creek and attack the Germans to the north.
If Company G had followed this route it might have contacted Company E and helped to check the flow of Germans across the firebreak. But the breakthrough was already too well established, and by the time Company G was on its way many of the Germans who had broken through were already chasing the retreating platoon from Company F eastward toward Schweighausen. Evidently they meant to attack Schweighausen immediately, without waiting for their right flank to be secured by the capture of Uhlweller and the high ground outside Ohlungen. But Company G failed to follow its assigned route, and instead of coming upon that part of the German penetration, which they had been ordered to attack, they encountered one equally if not more threatening. Although they failed to accomplish their original mission, they did a great deal to stem the German advance on Schweighausen.
Soon after 2000, Company G was moving through the woods with its 3rd Platoon on the left, 1st on the right and four scouts leading each platoon. They came to a clearing 150 yards across. As the first scouts reached the edge of the woods on the other side, they touched off a tremendous German volley. Two of the scouts were instantly killed, and the advance platoons were pinned down by four machine guns and a company of riflemen. Mortar fire now zeroed in on them as they lay exposed in the snow in the clearing. Captain Palmes ordered an attack. As Tech. Sgt. Sigman Poskus stood up to lead the 3rd Platoon forward, a mortar shell killed him. Nevertheless, his men moved up. To their right, Tech. Sgt. Mike Walters led his 1st Platoon. They crawled into firing positions and poured flanking fire into the Germans. By moving forward, both platoons helped pull the company out of a hopeless position. After five hours, Palmes ordered a withdrawal to Ohlungen. They brought back with them four dead and 19 wounded. After the battle 67 German dead were found in the area of the engagement.
Meanwhile, at Neubourg, a small group of GIs fought to stop the German assault there. Shortly before midnight, when Woelfer came back from his raid, he met a group of 25 men from the 1st Platoon, Company L. Captain Harold Bugno, the 3rd Battalion's executive officer, led the platoon. Bugno commandeered an armored car and started down the road toward the Mill d'Uhrbruck. The captain led the men on the left side of the car while the platoon sergeant, Staff Sgt. Othal J. Fletcher, led the men on the right. Their mission was to re-establish Company K's right flank and, if possible, get through to Company E.
They proceeded to Sergeant Roger A. Peck's machine-gun position along the Schweighausen-Neubourg road on the left of Company K, where they were told Germans were ahead. Fanning out from either side of the armored car, the patrol moved on but had only gone a little way when they were fired upon. They had stumbled on a platoon of Germans advancing on Neubourg. After an hour and a half of fighting, 16 Germans came out yelling Kamarad! The rest either had been killed or wounded or had retreated.
The prisoners were sent to the rear and the platoon moved on toward a machine gun Sergeant Fletcher could hear firing in the distance–probably in Company E's area. They had gone about 300 yards when they saw a group of Germans dressed in white ahead of them in the woods. For 45 minutes the German force, about 30 men, tried to break through Bugno's American skirmish line.
Private Herman J. Bergeth saw Privates Franklin Van Nest and Joe A. McGraw and one other GI engaged in hand-to-hand combat in a ditch with several Germans. According to Bergeth, Van Nest, a big man, was wielding a knife as large as a Roman short sword. They seemed to have won their struggle when a couple of German grenades were tossed into the ditch, wounding both men.
Germans firing submachine guns came in on the left, threatening to outflank the Americans. Private Robert Owen killed four before Bugno withdrew his men to the site of their earlier fight, where they would be supported by Peck's machine gun. There they managed to stop the German advance.
Although wounded, Van Nest and McGraw refused to retreat and continued to kill the few Germans who tried to advance. When word came from battalion of a possible tank attack from the direction of the Mill d'Uhrbruck, Bugno sent back for bazookas. No tanks came, but German voices were heard. Then, German artillery fire began falling on them. Realizing that they had been zeroed in, Bugno ordered his men to retire.
As they stood up to retreat, artillery rounds killed Bugno, McGraw and Van Nest. The rest fell back, several of them wounded by shrapnel. They could hold out no longer, but they had done their job. They had blunted the German effort toward Neubourg.
Company I, meanwhile, had its own troubles stopping attempts by the 104th Volksgrenadiers to flank Neubourg from the west. Groups of German infantry tried throughout the night to knock out the machine guns of the 1st Platoon, Company M, and to crack the line of foxholes that guarded the open ground beyond the town. At the time of the main attack on the Ohlungen Forest, after the artillery barrage, the Volksgrenadiers opened fire with machine guns from the river, and then, bellowing at each other, started to attack. One of the M8s on the western outskirts of Neubourg added its fire to that of the Company M machine guns and mortars, and after a prolonged hammering broke up the assault.
But even while the Volksgrenadiers were attempting to flank Neubourg from the west and Panzergrenadiers were trying to break through Captain Bugno's men and flank the town from the east, other Germans drove south through the forest toward Uhlweller. Here, as on the other end of the line, the German plan misfired. If the Volksgrenadiers were less than aggressive in their assault, the paratroopers and Panzergrenadiers were foolhardy. The paratroopers attacked Schweighausen before securing their right by taking the high ground near Ohlungen, and as a consequence were held up by Company G. The Panzergrenadiers advanced toward Uhlweller. They were stopped by a company from the 1st Battalion, which, like Company G, failed in its assigned mission but instead accomplished something of greater value.
The reserve 1st Battalion had been alerted at 2050 and prepared to send elements out from Ohlungen to check German attempts to break out of the forest to the south. At midnight, Major Walter Fellenz received orders to send a company to sweep the woods up to the Mill d'Uhrbruck and to plug the gap there. Unsure of exactly what was happening, he believed that the western end of the forest could be cleared and that Company K's sector could be restored–which he ordered Company B to do.
Company B moved out of Ohlungen shortly after midnight on the road toward Uhlweller, but turned off to the right just before reaching the town, taking the road leading up through the woods to the Mill d'Uhrbruck. It moved through the woods, with an advance platoon led by scouts on either side of the road. The scouts came to the edge of the woods and moved in slowly. Suddenly, there was a burst of machine-gun fire, followed by a volley of small-arms fire that grew in intensity as a second machine gun joined the first, pinning down Company B. Because the machine guns were able to fire up the rising fields on either side of the company, the GIs were unable to move into flanking positions. After nearly an hour of exchanging fire, Company B advanced.
Second Lieutenant George A. Jackson took five men from his 2nd Platoon and, under covering fire, moved up into the woods to the west of the road. They found the German machine guns positioned close together on the opposite side of the road. Jackson and his men ran across the road, moved up behind the two machine guns and opened fire from a distance of about 25 yards. Then they charged. A bullet nicked the top of Jackson's head but he kept going until he was on top of the machine-gun nest. Staff Sergeant Darwin C. Freeman ran forward firing his rifle until it jammed. Then he clubbed one German with the rifle butt. All seven Germans manning the machine guns were killed.
The company was now free to fan out and move into the woods. They had lost eight men killed and 15 wounded during the attack. Later they counted 50 dead Germans in the woods. The 222nd Infantry had effectively stopped the German breakthrough, established a line along the German bulge and, in spite of rumors that Neubourg had fallen, retained control of the important crossroads town.
At 1030 on January 25, reinforcements arrived and began to push forward beyond the line that Captain Bugno and the Company L platoon had defended, and which Company K now held with Company B on its right, while Major Fellenz's 1st Battalion held the southern edge of the forest. Shortly after daybreak Fellenz sent part of Company A up to dig in on Company B's right. The line then extended south along the edge of the woods, where Company G had dug in after its fight on the previous night. The rest of the 1st Battalion was deployed with Company D and the balance of Company A defending Ohlungen, while Company C defended the nearby high ground. Although the Germans had forced their way down to the southwest corner of Schweighausen, Companies F and H still held the town.
Early in the morning the commander of the 314th Infantry, which had been ordered to come to the support of the 222nd, arrived at the regiment's headquarters in Keffendorf. He planned to send two companies of his 3rd Battalion, supported by three tanks, along the same route that Company B had taken the night before. These two companies would sweep up from the southwest corner of the forest to re-establish the line around the Mill d'Uhrbruck. He also planned to send elements of his 1st Battalion down the road from Ohlungen to Schweighausen, pass along the western outskirts of the town, move through Company F and re-establish the line's right flank.
Meanwhile, the 68th Armored Infantry Battalion, 14th Armored Division, which had arrived at Ohlungen shortly after daybreak, was to attack the southeast corner of the forest and drive up to the center of the original line. It was hoped that this three-pronged attack would restore the 222nd's positions and halt any further German attempts to outflank Haguenau.
Companies I and K, of the 314th, moved directly to Neubourg, then out to the line Bugno had held, and formed up for an attack. This line bent south from a draw situated halfway between Neubourg and the Mill d'Uhrbruck that cut from the firebreak south into the woods, almost to the road. There, on the east side of a little bridge over the draw, were placed the two Company M machine guns that had been employed throughout the night farther to the east. The guns formed part of a thin defensive line that included a platoon of riflemen drawn from the 3rd Platoon, Company K, and the remains of Captain Bugno's battered Company L platoon.
The veterans of the previous night's action greeted the newcomers with silent gratitude. Company I, off to the north side of the road, and Company K, to the south of the road, looked on as the men of the 314th shoved off into the woods toward the Mill d'Uhrbruck.
About 200 yards from the mill they encountered heavy German fire. After fighting for about an hour and a half the 314th withdrew to a line that ran south from a point midway between the draw and the mill. While not linking up with the 1st Battalion, they hit the Germans near the mill so hard that they prevented them from launching their own attack. The two companies dug in and established new positions around noon, tying in with the 222nd's Company B. The two Company M machine guns and the 3rd Platoon, Company K, which had been forced to pull back when Bugno withdrew, were now able to return to their original positions.
The unit's history summed up the action: We took a mauling, but held our ground. We had proved that the Americans could fight with a cold passion and a fury even without that unlimited supply of material which so many believe is responsible for American success in battle.

I hit pay dirt! I always heard that my uncle PFc Walter Neef was wounded at the bulge but could never place the 42nd div there. I am grateful and he is still alive!
My father was in the 42nd Infantry, what is the Indianhead symbol??
Ms. Weimar: You may have garbled information. The Indianhead patch (It has an Indian head with warbonnet in profile, on a white star, on a black shield)belongs to the US 2nd Infantry Division, which had the 9th, 23rd & 38th Infantry Regiments. It is a regular army unit and exists today, located in Korea.
This is great. My father served in the 42nd division during WWII
and to the best of my knowledge was part of Task Force Linden.
While I have no idea which regiment/company/platoon he was
in, having this level of detail available for some of the battles
helps me relive his experiences.
Thanks
I served in Compamy "B" 222nd Infantry, 42nd Rainbow Division in WWII. Some of the information in this account is not quite right. "B" 222nd Inf. moved from Ohlungen to Uhlwiller just after 0100 Hours we moved towards the forest in two columns. Upon reaching the forest we were to form a skirmish line and move thru the Ohlungen Forest. I was the forth man in the right hand column. When the first man was about 25 yards from the trees I had a feeling that things were not right so I hit the ground. In just seconds the night looked like the Fourth of July as three German machine guns opened up. One firing into the field to the right of the roadway. A second firing into the field to the left of the roadway. The third was spraying both sides of the roadway. Had I not been on the ground I might not be writing this. The others had not hit the ground and were either wounded (15) or killed (8) that morning. Much of our story was never told because our Company Commander Capt. William Mueller quarantined every one so his error in forming the skirmish line at the forest line instead of our move out of Uhlwiller. The 222nd Infantry received the "Presidential Unit Citation" for this action. I was awarded the Bronze Star for my part in this operation. The remaining information is factual, Lou Kramer, "B" 222nd Inf. 42nd Rainbow Division.
hello Louis nice to talk to you.
I was in the 222nd Co K 3rd bat 42nd Rainbow div, I never heard about the Presidential Unit Citation until I read from you, is this something I must apply for.were you at the occupation of Austria in 1945? I also served with the 262nd with the 66th panther div. I served under Gen Collins, Gen Kramer under Patton I was in from 43 to 46. France, Germany, Belgium, Austria. please get back to me, thank you stay well.
tootie
Lt. Debenedetto,
The Presidential Unit Citation was awarded posthumously 10 Jan 2001. If you cannot find a copy of the award or other documents pertaining to the citation, simply provide me with an email address and I will forward copies of those documents to you.
Hello my grandfather was in the 42nd Rainbow Div. and I was wondering if any of you guys know of how to get any information on him? His name was Roy Prado the only info I could find on him was his discharge papers, which doesn't tell me much. They said most of the service records for WWII vets was burned in a fire back in the 70's. If any of you guys know of any information on him or where I can obtain such information it would be much appreciated. He passed away back in 2010 and when I would ask him about some of his war stories he would mention certain things about Hagenau forest. I still have his Rainbow shoulder patch along with other memorabilia he acquired throughout his service. Thanks for your service guys!
I read Mr. Kramers comments and I wonder If you could recall what artillery battalion supported "b" co. My dad was a forward observer for the 392nd "B " battery. He was attached to the 222nd, but he can't recall which companys they followed. I would be grateful for any information you might have. Thank you.
Craig,
Officially the 222nd Infantry Regiment was assigned to the Seventh Army, VI Army Group, VI Corps, 42nd "Rainbow" Infantry Division, 3rd Battalion as of 24 Dec 1944. This assignment is what we now know as "Task Force Linden." That appears to have been the case until it changed to the XXI Corps effective 25 Mar 1945. I found a "Detachment" effective from 2 Apr 1945 to 8 Apr 1945 wherein they were attached to the 12th US Armored Division "The Hellcats." The next record I have shows a change to the XV Corps, effective from 19 Apr 1945 to 21 Apr 1945. Task Force Linden was dissolved, effective 6 Feb 1945. Hopefully this information can help narrow down your efforts to identify the particular Artillery Battalion.
David, Thanks for the info. Dad was in the 392nd FA btn. B batt. He carried the radio and called in fire commands while following a Captain in the 222nd. Unfortunately he can't remember the captain's name or what company/regiment he was in. That's why I was wondering if anyone knew which artillery battalions/ batteries supported which infantry regiment/ companies during this particular time. If I was able to drop some names maybe it would jog his memory. I'm trying to get as much information as I can written down so this history isn't lost. Thanks, Craig
Hello,
My family lives in the mill Neubourg since the early 1900s. During the war a soldier named Raleigh Rollins of the 42nd Rainbow Division 3nd Battalion 222nd regiment? /? came to my grandmother from the rubble of the mill for the shield. Does anyone know the place and have pictures during the war?
My father and I restore a Dodge WC52.
Does the 3nd batalion there were dodges WC52?
Do you have any details on the fighting that took place on the front of moder?
Sincerely Cédric
Cedric, you can go to the website of the 42nd Rainbow Division or simply search "Task Force Linden" and obtain some detailed accounts of the fighting that took place on 24 Jan 1945 through 25 Jan 1945. You will find some very detailed accounts by looking at "Operation Nordwind: U.S. Army's 42nd Infantry Division Stood its Ground During World War II" as well. The article was originally published by World War II magazine. Published Online 31 Aug 2006. The 222nd Infantry Regiment established a front that ran from Neubourg to the town of Schweighausen. Maybe that will help?
My Father, Gordon I Shold(deceased 1983)was a "pioneer" for the 22nd inf, first in Co E, and then 3rd btl, hq co.
"Pioneers" were a PC way of saying you will be no man's land, between the lines, advancing to clerar land mines/boobytraps or setting land mines on a withdrawl. He was awarded the bronze star for setting a road block(land mines)under fire the night of Jan 24, 1945 near Neuborg.
He was at the liberation of Dachau and was later wounded near Garmish at the end of the war looking for SS in the mountains.
I have a number of pictures of his service and a pass personally signed by Harold Bugno, mentioned in this article, when they were in Oklahoma for training before shipping out.
Would like to contact anyone whose father/grandfather/uncle/etc may have served with my Dad then.
Thanks,
Dick Shold
Madison, Wi
Richard,
My Uncle was in 'F' Company, 222nd Infantry Regiment. He was KIA on 25 Jan 1945 but I'd definitely like to contact you or any of the men who served during the battle of Alsace. I set up an email address exclusively for this purpose at legallyshafted1@yahoo.com. Thanks.
My uncle is the Harold Bugno that you're referring to. I don't know a lot about him other than what I have researched but would love to contact you and possibly get a copy of the signed pass.
My e-mail is rshold@charter.net thought it would be printed in my post above, but was not.
This is for Cedric Schalck.
Sadly, Raleigh Rollins died 2 weeks ago at the age of 87. He was in touch with your family, having brought his family to your mill and home 2 times in the past 25 years. I believe your family has his address in Georgia, or leave your email address here and we will gladly respond.
Please give your family our regards.
Sadly Raleigh Rollins died 2 weeks ago at the age of 87. His family visited your family home and the mill where that ferocious battle was fought , 2 times in 25 years. If you have any other questions please leave your email address, or write to his address . or leave your address. How is Claudine?
We hope your family is well
Thanks for the article. My dad was in Company B of the 222nd. He was awarded the bronze star for taking over and maning a machine gun position. He has never ever talked about that battle or for that matter any of the other battles he took part in. He is now 87 years of age and in ill health.
This is for k.r.luckey
My Email adress is cedric.schalck@wanadoo.fr
My father, Anthony Nicosia, also fought in the 222nd Inf., although I don't recall what Company he was assigned. He passed a number of years ago, however if anyone recalls having served with him or had a family member who did I would enjoy hearing from you. Also my Mom turns 80 years young this year, and if anyone can assist me in how I can obtain a copy of the Presidential Unit Citation I would like to give it to her for her birthday.

My father, James Wade Vines (Jay) was in the 42nd division. He rarely spoke of his service but I remember when I was about 10 a war buddy of his came for a visit. Dad told me that the reason that the man's face was scarred was that he was wounded in a battle while crossing a large clearing in the woods. After the battle was over the were checking for wounded comrades and they noticed that this man was alive and they got him back to an aid station.
Later he would enter into Dachau, but he didn't want to talk about that much. My Grandmother told us of that when we asked later. Dad passed away in 2007 at age 90.
If anyone has any more articles on the 42nd and it's battles I would appreciate a pointer in that direction.
Thanks,

My father, Thomas Skaggs Jr., was a machine gunner in Company E. He and two others were captured in the wee hours of the 25th having exhausted all machine gun rounds and down to last shot in the 45s. They had held off all night without ever getting order to retreat. He was liberated from Stalag IXB 2-27-45. Dad died in 1987 after a great later life.
Hi Steven,
My father Charles R. Venneman, from Chillicothe, Missouri was very good friends with a Thomas Skaggs. They were both in the 14th Armored Division, but were separated. Dad was injured on January 13th and shipped to a hospital in England. My Dad has had me do a search for his friend, and I just came across this letter while doing research for my daughter on World War II. Is it possible that your father was my Dad's friend. I just read to him what you wrote and it saddened him.
I look forward to hearing from you!
Thanks very much,
Tamera
I'm sorry – I meant to say Thomas Skaggs, Jr was liberated from Stalag 9B on April 2nd, not in February. I'd love to hear from anyone who knows how to discover battalion or platoon he was with. He was a heavy machine gunner.
S.Skaggs(at)louisville.edu
Thanks!
My father, Quentin Naumann, served in the 222nd Company H in the mortar platoon. He led the platoon, and at some point was briefly the Company commander and at times the Company Executive Officer, but maybe that was during the occupation. He passed away in June 2008. He did not speak much about the war, or of Dachau, until recent years when we pressed, and even then not about the grit, blood, fear, horrors, pains. If anybody knew him or if your father served with him, I would like to hear from you.
Thanks.
my uncle sgt leslie parker mccormick was killed 1-12-1945 in alsace france. I never got to meet him but always wondered how he died. any info would be appreciated.
I had a great uncle in the 222nd infantry 42 division his name was claro cadena and was killed in action 1-24-45. No one in the family knows if this article was the actual fight he was in. I say this is it. thanks
post note: Claro Cadena I dont know his company…would like any survivors who may have known him get in contact with me

thank you
I've created a 42nd Rainbow ID Facebook page honoring my Grandfather, and those he served with. Please join us:
My Grandfather was Company G, Commander, Jere Palmes who was KIA shortly after this action. This is a awesome account of the 222nd's battle history and my Grandfather's unit. Ironically or due to genetics, I ended up getting comissioned as a infantry officer (USA) and spent my duty in Germany / Bosnia / Kosovo. Thanks for the info.
Sui Sponte
Dear Lance my father John Klisz served with your grand father during this battle. He always spoke of your grand father as the best soldier he ever new. He was so impressed with your grandpa and his bravery that he named his second son,my brother Gerald after your grandfather .I would lone to hear from you someday.Tom Klisz
Lance, my grandfather, Gene Norman, also served in Company G and fought in this action, apparently under the command of your grandfather. Thanks for sharing. Always on the look out for information from other brothers in arms.
My father "Wimpy" Tom Padilla also served with the 222nd. He passed away in 1992
To P Naumann,
My father Charles "rocky" Lorrekovich also served in the 222nd Company H in a heavy weapon platoon. He was a Tech. SGT. Don't know if they knew each other. Do you?
Trent
Just discovered your reply. And I just spoke with David Walker who was part of the same Company H, and the same platoon as my father, Quentin Naumann. David said theirs was the 3 Mortar platoon if I understood correctly. I suppose records exist somewhere with which we could figure out if "Rocky" served alongside Quentin Naumann, David Walker, and I should add, Morris Eisenstein.
My father, Stefan "Steve" Munsing, was with Companies A and C of the 222nd according to the records I've seen. He carried a machine gun. He was wounded in Alsace, so I'm not sure if he was on this action–he was in on the liberation of Dachau, and what he would only describe as some "really rough"fighting against SS units in the mountains approaching Austria. After the war he was in the Occupation forces and then moved on to other government work. He passed on in 1995–I'd be interested if anyone has any records that place what companies he was in.
Anyone can write me at : quartetwyo@gmail.com
Like many of you, my dad wouldn't talk much about the war. He liked Clark. He did say of officers in general that most cared only about their own record and didn't care too much about who got killed along the way, so he probably witnessed some of the wrong moves if not at the Hagenau then in the Voges.
All the best.
My great Uncle, Antonio "Tony" Weber served with the 42nd during their entire European campaign. He earned 3 Bronze Stars during his deplyment. He didn't talk about his war experience. Uncle Tony passed away in his hometown of nevada, MO, last week at the age of 91. He was a great, great man. I'd like to know more about him if anybody out there might remember him. The 42nd, apparently was a true representation of the great generation. KK
My grandfather Carley C. White served with the 42nd in WWII. He never talked about it, I am interested in more information on what all he experienced.
My great uncle Forest Reynolds was a rifleman in Co. K 222nd Infantry Reg. Any info anyone had about him would be very much appreciated. He died in 1995 in Alabama, where he was from.
We have the regimental book and the division book somewhere, my Dad recently moved so there is till a lot of stuff in boxes. My dad Eldon A. Sumrall served in Company K, 222nd.
alsumrall2001@yahoo.com
My father, Eldon A. Sumrall, was in Co. K 222nd, has it on his license plate. Still going strong.
I am looking for any information about my Uncle. I'm hoping maybe your father can help me.
His name was Edward M. Kennedy, he was a second Lieutenant in the 42nd Infantry. 222d company K
When he cam back from Germany he told my mom, his little sister about the liberation of the concentration camp.. To my knowledge it was the only time he spoke of it…my mother remembers few very gruesome details.
My Uncle died a few years back and took his memories of Germany with him. Neither my mother or his own children ever heard about what happened in Germany outside of a small article regarding his receiving the Silver Star.
Last week I was visiting my Mom and she handed me a box of jewelry. It was jewelry that my uncle Ed had collected in Germany and he gave it all to her. She in turn passed it on to me and asked me to find out anything I could about it..
Outside of his actions in Furth, Germany I know little else about my Uncle. I would like to find out anything else that I can about him if possible.
I appreciate any information you can give me.

Walkers at the 250th Battery, 42nd Inf. Div. in Salzburg 1945/46.
He returned to the States 6th of February 1946
Recently I have had the honor to meet COL (ret) T.R. Mackechnie. I was told he served with the 42nd. I fail to find the words that describe my deep respect for him, and all those who fought then. Thank you.
Here is a link to a map that COL Mackechnie drew depicting where the 42nd Inf Rainbow Div served during WWII. Enjoy.
I just learned from my father that he was wounded during this battle. He had never talked about it until he found this article. Up to now all the stories have been just that… stories. They were the things movies were made of. Knowing my father was there, and reading what was happening has put things in an entirely different light. I am so grateful for the "kids" who sacrificed so much.
Hello Dave
I would like you to resend those documents on the presidential unit citation, I lost them when my computer was hit by over voltage. thanking you in advance

Keith, I have an ORIGINAL copy of that map as well as many pictures, original ribbons, post cards, etc. My grandfather was a member of Company G, 232nd Infantry, 42nd Rainbow Division and was MIA for 31 days from 1/5/45 until 2/8/45 during the battles in what was then called Austria. His service was a duty to him and he lived with nightmares for many years, to me, his service made him a hero in my eyes. He dies in 2002 of lung problems. In his will he left me his photo albums and artifacts from the war, and next to my children and husband it is my most prized possession. I was the only person he ever discussed his experiences.
Lance, my grandfather, Gene Norman, also served in Company G and fought in this action, apparently under the command of your grandfather. Thanks for sharing. Always on the look out for information from other brothers in arms.
Do any of you know PFC Birney T. Chic Havey? He was in the 42nd Division 222nd AT Company. He earned the Silver Star 2Bronze Stars and the Purple Heart. Chic is from St. Louis, Missouri. He has told me all about Task Force Linden.
One more bit of Info on Chic Havey A german pilot flew really low and clipped a truck and crashed cut the pilots body in half but was wearing a carabou white coat. Chic took it of the upper torso which had no blood on it and used it the rest of the war as a pillow. His Silver Star Citation refrences PVT Dickey and PVT Crews

The Battle of Hampton Roads is the most famous naval encounter of the American Civil War, and one of the most significant battles in the history of naval warfare. This despite the most important fighting only involving one ship on each side!
What makes this small scale battle so important is that it saw the first fight between two ironclad warships. Neither U.S.S. Monitor nor the C.S.S. Virginia can claim to have been the first ironclad warship, although both ships were significantly different from earlier designs. The first ironclad warships of modern times were produced by the French. These ships were ironclad gun batteries, based on barges, and needed to be towed into place by other ships. They were first used during the Crimean War, where they demonstrated the value of their iron armour during the bombardment of Kinburn. Their success convinced both the British and the French to start working on ocean-going ironclad warships. The French won this naval race, launching the Gloire in 1859. The British followed in 1860 with H.M.S. Warrior, a much bigger ship that even made the Gloire obsolete! However, both of these ships were otherwise typical ships of their time, powered by both steam and wind power, and with their guns arranged to deliver broadsides.
Compared to these ships, both the Virginia and the Monitor were revolutionary designs. At the outbreak of the civil war it was obvious that the south was never going to be able to match the north in conventional warships, and so the Confederates concentrated their ship building efforts on producing an ironclad ‘secret weapon’ capable of sweeping the U.S. Navy’s wooden ships from the seas.
The Confederate effort had been greatly aided by the North’s unnecessarily rapid evacuation of the Norfolk naval base. There the Confederates found the U.S.S. Merrimac, a steam powered frigate that had been sunk but not destroyed by the retreating Federals. The C.S.S. Virginia would be built around the hull of the Merrimac and using her engines. The Merrimac was raised from the bottom, her top decks removed, and a new armoured structure built on top to house her guns, arranged in broadside. She relied entirely on her steam engines for power.
The U.S.S. Monitor was even more revolutionary. She too was an entirely steam driven ship, but there the similarities to early warships end. She was one of three designs of ironclad build in the north in response to news coming out of the south about the Virginia. She was much smaller than the Virginia(172 feet long compared to 264 feet for the Virginia, and only a quarter of the weight). She was designed to sail with her deck only a couple of feet above the water. All of her firepower would come from two eleven-inch guns contained in a rotating turret.
Despite a much later start, the Monitor was launched on 30 January 1862, two weeks before the Virginia. On 6 March the U.S.S. Monitor left New York to begin her trip to the James River, where a small Union fleet at Hampton Roads was guarding the river and nervously waiting for the Virginiato emerge from Norfolk.
That fleet contained five ships, but of them three (the St. Lawrence, Congress and Cumberland) were obsolete sailing ships. Of the two modern steam frigates, the Roanoke had a broken propeller shaft, effectively leaving her immobilised. That left the U.S.S. Minnesota as the only functioning Union steamship at Hampton Roads.
On 8 March the C.S.S. Virginia finallywas now revealed to have some serious flaws. The most significant on 8 March Welles was able to calm the atmosphere somewhat by announcing the arrival of the Monitor at Hampton Roads, but she was an entirely untested ship. Only the events of the next day would tell if she was a success or a failure.
On 9 March the C.S.S. Virginia sailed back out to Hampton Roads, unaware that the U.S.S. Monitor had arrived. The stage was set for the first fight between ironclad warships. Over the next two hours the two ironclads pounded away at each other, and soon discovered that they could hardly hurt each other. The Monitor was much more manoeuvr quite vulnerable. After the battle ninety seven dents were found in the Virginia’s armour, twenty of them from the Monitor’s guns. Six of these shots had broken her outer armour,iaran, then they would have been able to sink the Monitor, but the Union ship’s vastly superior manoeuvrability makes that seem somewhat unlikely. The first battle between ironclads was a tactical draw.
Strategically it was a Union victory. The Monitor had proved that she could fight off the Virginia, immediately reducing the threat she posed. Union operations in the James River could continue, as could the planned expedition to the Peninsula. In some respects the battle had a greater impact in Britain. The Times considered the battle to have reduced the size of the Royal Navy from 149 first class warships to just her two ironclads. This was something of an exaggeration. The Monitor was almost totally un-seaworthy. She could cope in a river estuary, but had nearly sunk on her first sea journey, and would soon be lost at sea in heavy weather. The Virginia was so slow and un-manoeuvrable that she could only pose a serious threat in the confined spaces of an estuary. Nevertheless, the lesson of Hampton Roads was clear – the wooden warship was now virtually obsolete.

In the early years of the war Cromwell was not a major figure. He achieved an early success on 10 August 1642, when he prevented the Royalists from taking the plate from the Cambridge colleges, and was present at the battle of Edgehill with his small cavalry troop, but his role is unknown. In 1643 he was one of several Parliamentary commanders in East Anglia, and took part in a series of battles, now with a regiment of horse, soon to become the famous Ironsides. Cromwell and his associates spend most of the summer attempting to block the advance of the earl of Newcastle's northern army in their attempts to march south as part of Charles I's strategy for 1643. The first skirmish came on 13 May (battle of Grantham), where a parliamentary force led by Lord Willoughby of Parham, Sir John Hotham, and Cromwell defeated a 1,200 strong Royalist force under Charles Cavendish. The fighting then centred on Gainsborough, captured by Willoughby in July. Cromwell, ordered to go to his aid, once again encountered Cavendish (battle of Gainsborough, 28 July 1643), which saw the death of Cavendish. However, the Parliamentarians then found themselves faced by Newcastle's main army, marching to besiege Gainsborough, and rapidly retreated. Cromwell once again reduced to a junior role, as one regimental commander amongst many under the earl of Manchester. When battle came (Winceby, 11 October 1643), Cromwell's role was minor. He appears to have been taken out of the battle after his horse was killed, and missed most of the significant action, with the battle being won by Thomas Fairfax, who cavalry charge carried the day. Winceby helped decided Newcastle against marching towards London, and thus helped spoil Charles's plan for the year. Although Cromwell had not yet achieved his later prominence, he was well known for the quality of his cavalry, served as governor of the Isle of Ely, and was second-in-command to the earl of Manchester. When Parliament created the Committee of Both Kingdoms (16 February 1644), to control the war, Cromwell was one of the initial members. By Marston Moor (2 July 1644), he had enough to gain command of the Parliamentary left wing, and while his own role is perhaps unclear, his cavalry played the most important part in Parliament's victory, and for that Cromwell can take the full credit. He was still reletivly junior at the 2nd battle of Newbury (27 October 1644), only ranking as commander of the cavalry of the Eastern Association, in what was a very badly run battle for Parliament.
Only now does Cromwell begin to gain the importance we are used to seeing him with. In the aftermath of the failure at Newbury, Cromwell accused Newcastle of 'continued backwardness', and disputed his version of the battle. In the ensuing debate, it became clear that the army was in need of reform, and on 23 November 1644 Parliament ordered the Committee of Both Kingdoms to come up with a plan, and on 6 January 1645 the committee delivered the plan which was to produce the New Model Army. In the meantime, probably under Cromwell's direction, the Self Denying Ordinance was introduced in the House of Commons on 9 December. This would remove from command anyone who sat in Parliament, and was quickly passed by the Commons, although was refused by the Lords on 13 January 1645, and only passed by them on 3 April, in a version which made exception for Cromwell, who now became General of Horse, and second in command behind Fairfax.
By the time the Ordinance was picked, Cromwell was already back in action, having been sent to join Waller in the west country to deal with the threat posed by Goring, who despite some success in keeping Waller out of the west country was soon contained, allowing Cromwell to return for what was to be the deciding battle of the war. When the main armies came together at the battle of Naseby (14 June 1645), Cromwell commanded the Parliamentary right. As the battle developed, it was only on this flank that Parliament was initially victorious, but that was enough, and once Cromwell had driven off his direct opponents, and sent a force to stop them rallying, he was able to attack the now defenceless Royalist infantry, which was almost entirely destroyed, mostly through capture. The Royalist position now began to collapse. The New Model, including Cromwell, moved against Goring and the Royalist army in the west, which was effectively defeated at the battle of Langport (10 July 1645), where Cromwell's Ironsides played a key part in the Parliamentary victory. Cromwell then embarked on a series of sieges which rapidly captured Devizes castle (23 September), Winchester (6 October), and Basing House (14 October), before defeating some of the few remaining Royalist horse at Bovey Tracey (9 January 1646). By this point, the fighting was almost over, and for a short period, Cromwell was more concerned with politics than fighting.
The main issue facing the army was it's future. With the real fighting over, Parliament wanted to disband the army. Cromwell joined with Fairfax in forming the General Council of the Army, which over the summer of 1647 made it clear that it would not disband until satisfied both politically and financially. However, for the moment the spectre of civil war loomed again. After escaping to Carisbrooke, Charles I had made his 'engagement' with the Scots, and provoked the Second Civil War. By the summer of 1648 a Scottish army once again threatened the north, this time on behalf of Charles. Cromwell was sent north to deal with it, and was soon on the trail of the 17,000 strong Scottish army, with somewhere between 6,500 and 9,000 troops of his own. Despite being outnumbered, Cromwell's troops were in much better shape that the Scots, and, even worse, as Cromwell approached them at Preston, the Scots were badly spread out. The resulting battle of Preston (17-19 August) was Cromwell's first major battle as commander in chief, and he acquitted himself well, defeating a much larger force component by component, and ending the threat from the Scots.
Cromwell was now determined to see Charles removed for good. On 6 December, Pride's Purge removed those members of Parliament who might have objected to the trial and execution, and after a trial of doubtful legality, Charles was executed on 30 January 1649. While England began life without a monarch, in March 1649 Cromwell was given command in Ireland, where the Irish revolt still went on, by now under the earl of Ormonde, who had managed to unite most of Ireland against Parliament. Cromwell reached Dublin in mid August, taking Drogheda on 12 September, and Wexford on 16 October, in each case acting ruthlessly towards the garrison and any captured priests. However, Cromwell's time in Ireland was cut short by trouble in Scotland.
After an abortive landing for Charles II by Montrose, Charles, who had been in negotiation with the Scots, agreed on 23 June 1650 to accept the Covenant, thus gaining Scottish support. Charles landed in Scotland, and an army was raised. Parliament was not idle while this was going on. After Fairfax resigned command in protest at a plan to invade Scotland, Cromwell was appointed general, with command of the war against the Scots (26 June 1650). By 19 July, Cromwell, with 5,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry of the New Model Army, was at Berwick. Against him was David Leslie, with an inferior army, recently recruited and lacking experienced officers. Cromwell crossed into Scotland on 22 July, secured the port of Dunbar, and moved against Leslie, defending Edinburgh. However, Cromwell found himself facing a strong defensive position, and was forced to withdraw back to Dunbar. His army was now suffering a very high level of sickness, and a second sortie north also ended on 1 September back in Dunbar. This time, Leslie cut the road links back to England, and Cromwell found himself trapped and relying on the sea for his supplies. Leslie now appears to have assumed that Cromwell was planning to retreat, and prepared to attack the beleaguered English army. However, it was Cromwell who took the initiative, and the resulting battle of Dunbar (3 September), saw the Scottish army almost wiped out, with 10,000 men taken prisoner. Dunbar was probably Cromwell's most impressive military victory, defeating an enemy who outnumbered him, with an army suffering from series sickness, and after a series of futile marches across hostile territory. However, the war was not over. Charles II was still in Scotland, and Leslie began to raise another army, this time including English Royalists, excluded until Dunbar, which gave it a more experienced core. After a period of manoeuvres in which Cromwell managed to cut the Royalist army off from it's supply lines, Charles II ordered his army to march south and strike for London. By 22 August 1651, Charles and Leslie had captured Worcester, where they once again faced Cromwell. The Royalist position was strong, but they only had 12,000 men to face Cromwell's 25,000-30,000. In the resulting battle of Worcester (3 September 1651), Cromwell was able to launch two separate attacks, separated by the river Severn, a plan that at one point threatened to backfire, before the Royalist's crumbled. Charles II was one of the few senior Royalists to escape, and the Civil Wars were finally over.
Cromwell now found himself the most important figure in the army, the true source of power in the country. On 20 April 1653 he dissolved the Rump of the Long Parliament, which was briefly replaced by the Barebones Parliament, itself desolved on 12 December 1653. Finally, on 16 December 1653 Cromwell accepted the post of Lord Protector, ruling at first with a single chamber Parliament, which Cromwell soon dispensed with. Amongst his first problems was the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652-4), which he soon managed to bring to an end. Cromwell proceeded to rule through the army, dividing the country up into twelve districts, each under the control of a Major-General, with a troop of cavalry to enforce their decisions. Finally, a new constitution was put in place 1657, which provided for a second chamber appointed by Cromwell, as well as giving him the power to appoint his own successor. Cromwell did not long survive the new arrangement, dying on 3 September 1658. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 23 November, and for a brief period succeeded by his son Richard, but after the restoration his body was disinterred, and on 30 January 1661 hung on the gallows at Tyburn.

Most of the safety people here are a bit like that....paranoid, that is;
but there was one woman a few years ago who actually did say to me,
"you're grown up, you know what you're doing." She was originally from
Russia and apparently had chosen not to swallow the "protect people from
themselves and everything" line. I think she is still with us, just on
a different campus.
I always think it's funny when the safety people come around here,
because we're part of the Pharmacology & Toxicology dept...who would
know better than us what's dangerous and what isn't? :o)

Im in a rap group called The Lower Class. Hers one of our songs
I couldn't be your man, i'm complex
its hard to understand, what's coming next
i'm bad at making plans, just follow my steps
or my heart, whatever feels best x5
i'm daydreaming about a girl in my life
um probably 'bout sex, or video tapes of porn sights
whatever it is i entice
ideals of the future moments in my life, right? x2
maybe i'm drunk, bartender please can i have another drink for the night?
ride her to my house to unwind, lets watch some movies that i'll find
less interesting than the thought of your thighs, eyes, lips
can i have kiss? damn, sweeter than chocolate bliss
full were my hands as i gripped, a bottle and her hips
move her to my room no slip
except for the hat on the head of my dick
i'm getting nervous like system
shocked that i'm finally with you
wake up, you're gone i miss you
chorus repeat
follow my voice, leading you down the road less traveled
acting like we ever had a choice, the option is yours
you can play or pass, move on with me straight forth clear a path
move from a rough past, the mountain that we're climbing can't last
there's always a second half, for every tear there's a laugh
for every 1, there's another one go and do the math
i'm intelligent, but never been smart, i'm just telling you i've never played the part
always the main character now a supporting role
not really sure what to do when the film shows
my bad side, i blame it on the lighting
it shouldn't be a drama but it seems we're always fighting
if it was up to me i promise i'd be writing
a happy ending with you sitting right beside me
chorus
i'm the worst at this relationship
i can't believe you can stand there and take my shit
i make my lip and feel like a dip shit
i need a psychiatrist, call doctor lipschitz
i miss it, the times when we'd chill
destroying all clocks with the times that we'd kill
all the guts spilled, till the sun came up
i'd give fame up but still
i had to go and be a fuck up
my walls went up and my nose stuck up but
when other dudes came and tried to run up
i was like nuh-uh, back the fuck up
but thats beside the point
this is about you, this is about 2, this is about truth
i can choose to do anything i wanna do
but i don't wanna lose you
chorus

From zero to hero: Seguin's breakout saves B's season

After leading the Bruins with 67 points during the regular season, Tyler Seguin was in the midst of crafting an unforgettable playoff story heading into a do-or-die Game 6 against the Washington Capitals. Unfortunately, it was a tale of colossal disappointment that the 20-year-old forward would have to live with for the entirety of the offseason and beyond.
With neither a goal nor an assist to his credit through Boston’s first five postseason contests, the wildly talented winger could’ve been one pointless effort away from putting the finishing touches on an extremely discouraging playoff showing.
Luckily for the Black and Gold, that wasn’t in the cards on Sunday afternoon at Verizon Center.
Seguin notched his first playoff point with an assist on Andrew Ference’s goal in the third period before silencing the packed house in D.C. in overtime. The speedy winger took a pass from Milan Lucic 3:17 into the extra session, broke in down the middle, waited out Braden Holtby and deposited the puck into the back of the net to give Boston a 4-3 win and force a Game 7 on Wednesday night.
“Yeah, I mean that’s the dream is to get those big goals and keep your team alive,” Seguin said. “I think looking back on my career so far this is probably one of my (greatest moments).”
With a team-high 21 shots in the series coming into Sunday, the chances had certainly been there for Seguin, especially in Game 5 back home when he narrowly missed putting a rebound past Holtby to get off the schnide.
“I thought yesterday he was a pretty good player,” coach Claude Julien said of Seguin’s performance in Game 5. “He missed that great opportunity to … the goaltender made a great save. When those things start happening, you know it’s coming around. I thought he was skating extremely well tonight and used his speed and had a chance really to gain and to be able to skate for him to get that goal.
“First of all, he made a great play on [Andrew] Ference’s goal and figured maybe jump on that, skate around their goaltender and finished it off. It’s great to see a young player like that gain some confidence for him to come together down the stretch.”
For Sunday’s hero, it sure felt great, too.
“Yeah, I mean I think in this series we’ve had a lot of chances and opportunities and I haven’t been bearing down and finishing them off,” Seguin said. “It’s just really nice to get that feeling off your back.”
Now, the Bruins and Capitals will embark on a decisive seventh game on Wednesday after six hard-fought games that were all decided by a single goal.
“It’s been a great series,” Seguin said. “Washington’s a great team. We were battling and for whatever reason the game lasted and they didn’t make it easy on (us). You go the extra mile. Game 7 at the Garden is what we’ve been working for, home ice advantage, so we’re going to seize the opportunity.”
If he can bring to that same productivity to the table on Wednesday at the Garden and help the Bruins advance to the second round, you can say sayonara to any chance of Seguin’s 2012 postseason being categorized as a tragic tale.

ECAC Hockey Journal: Quinnipiac's fight for respect continues.
"We talk about that being a good thing," Zurevinski said. "It's low pressure. We get overlooked sometimes because supposedly we don't have as much talent as other ECAC teams. That fuels the fire."
Quinnipiac made the most noise among ECAC teams during its non-league schedule in October. The Bobcats are 7-2 after winning at Princeton Tuesday night and have outscored opponents by a count of 40-18.
It's a far cry from a team that included 18 freshmen and sophomores, and finished 16-15-8 last season. It was a season not unlike many others for Quinnipiac since it joined ECAC Hockey in 2005 -- respectable, but not spectacular.
The Bobcats have never won the ECAC or qualified for an NCAA tournament since 2005. Among the 12 league squads, the Bobcats typically finish in the middle group of four teams in the standings.
"Being a Quinnipiac player, I'm very aware that we haven't won the ECAC tournament or been to the tourney," Zurevinski said. "That's definitely the goal."
The Bobcats have shown they will be led by a group of players who have yet to experience the team's ECAC struggles. Sophomore Jeremy Langlois, the team's leading scorer with eight goals in eight games, was not around in 2009-10, when the team started 12-1 but then bottomed out, winning just eight of its final 26 games.
Freshman Matthew Peca, who has already earned ECAC Rookie of the Week honors, wasn't on last year's team, which fell to Cornell in overtime in the ECAC tournament.
"The biggest difference in our room is that we've gone from a young team to a veteran team without carrying much baggage," Zurevinski said. "We have sophomores in the lineup all over the place, and the guys are willing to work."
Heading into league play in November, Quinnipiac appears to have established a slogan for the 2011-2012 season: Ignore your history.
Game of the Week
Cornell at Yale, Friday
It's a rematch of last year's ECAC Hockey championship, a game that the Bulldogs won 6-0. Under coach Keith Allain (Worcester, Mass.), Yale is 8-3-3 against Cornell with two shutouts.
The game will be aired live on the CBS Sports Network.
ECAC power ratings
1. Yale (1-0-1): Goaltender Jeff Malcolm stopped 55 of 58 shots in two games at the Ivy Shootout.
2. Union (3-1-3): Outshot UNH 38-23 in a 2-1 overtime loss on Friday.
3. Colgate (4-2-1): Played the most entertaining game of year in ECAC, a 7-6 overtime win over Niagara.
4. Quinnipiac (7-2): The Bobcats have scored four or more goals in eight of nine games.
5. Cornell (0-1): After a quiet October, the Big Red have road tilts at Yale, Brown, Harvard and Dartmouth in a span of eight days.
6. Clarkson (5-1-2): Unbeaten in their last six games.
7. Dartmouth (1-1): Big Green are 0-for-9 on the power play in two games.
8. Brown (1-1-0): Bumps up a few spots in the ranking after beating Princeton in the Ivy Shootout.
9. Princeton (0-1-1): Tigers have a nice feather in their cap with a tie against Yale in Ivy Shootout.
10. Harvard (0-0): Think Harvard will be ready to drop the puck for its opener Friday against Princeton? Crimson are last ECAC team to play a game that counts.
11. RPI (1-6): Has scored a total of five goals in seven games.
12. St. Lawrence (0-4): Will be looking for its first win this weekend with home tilts against Union and RPI.

Dennis Endras undoubtedly makes a save. Because he's awesome. Photo by Chris Krafcik of HoustonSportsZone.com.
Here are the things we know unequivocally about the Houston Aeros after this weekend:
Need shorter pre-game naps
That or they need to find a way to sneak a fake 0th period in before the 1st period to get the boys going in time for the actual game. Because bad Aeros starts are like hot days in Houston: There are too many of them.
In 10 games, the Aeros have scored only 4 goals in the first period, where opponents have scored 8.
Unstoppable the rest of the game
On the flip side, if you play the Aeros, you better not be within 3 goals of them because they have every bit of the ability to come back and smack you upside the head with a bunch of goals once they get their legs going.
They have scored 14 and 12 goals in the second and third periods, respectively, over the first 10 games. 4 vs. 14 and 12. Lopsided much?
Vets provide the foundation
Lots of scoring coming from prospects like Justin Fontaine, Kris Foucault, Casey Wellman, and David McIntyre is being supported by the vets like Jon DiSalvatore, Jed Ortmeyer, and Warren Peters. How lucky are these young guys to have wily vets with great vision and hockey smarts setting them up? Very. That’s how much.
Bad at shootouts
Aeros are 0 for 3 in shootouts so far this season. Before you start blaming goalies, look to the other end of the ice, where the shooters have 1 goal (Fontaine) in 20 attempts during the skills competition.
Hot Sticks
In spite of his 4 game suspension, Carson McMillan has quietly racked up 5 points in 6 games. Chay Genoway is finding his inner Max Noreau, too, heating up the score sheet with a few apples over the weekend.
Jeff Taffe has two goals from the weekend as well, looking like his scoring is ramping up as he adjust to the system.
Coach isn’t worried
John Torchetti is, understandably, unhappy with the bad starts, but said he knows this team is good… or at least will be when they figure out how to play a full 60 minutes.
Part of me wonders if this team isn’t so confident in their ability to pull things out at crunch time, they’re a) failing to prepare for individual games but also b) pacing themselves game to game, because even with these problems, they still lead the conference with 15 points and are tied for the league lead with the Norfolk Admirals.
Roster News
Defenseman Jordan Hendry leaves a hole on the blue line as he heads off after 10 games to the Swiss league. It never seemed like it was quite clicking with him, and with Prosser getting the first defenseman call-up, that was probably his cue to bail.
We'll see Thursday if this means big Mike Hoffman finally gets in the line-up or if the Aeros end up calling someone up.
Short and sweet this week, y’all, since I’m on the road and didn’t get to see any of the games over the weekend. When all else fails, stats stats stats! More first-hand meatiness next week, I promise!

If you haven't been paying attention, you may have noticed that one Minnesota-based college hockey team started the season white-hot, and has since played rather average hockey (at least in comparison).
Another Minnesota-based college hockey team, coming off its first-ever national championship, started the season 1-3, got swept at home by a rival in two scintillating but gut-wrenching games, and hasn't lost in 16 games since.
Because of that 16-game run, Minnesota Duluth has become the nation's top-ranked team in virtually every mathematical or subjective metric that you can concoct. Minnesota, meanwhile, is starting to look like a team that isn't going in the right direction.Minnesota started the season 9-1, looking virtually unstoppable at times. Like UMD during its streak, though, the Gophers were finding different ways to win games. They blew a 2-0 lead at UMD, fell behind in the final two minutes, needed a lucky bounce to get to overtime, but then made an amazing play to set up a Nate Condon overtime winner. The next night, the Gophers were outshot 50-16, trailed 2-0, but then took a 5-2 lead before holding on for dear life at the end.
They swept North Dakota at home, getting a huge goal from Kyle Rau late in the second game to secure the win. They blew out Sacred Heart twice.
But the wheels have started to wobble a bit for Minnesota as of late. The bounces they may have been getting are not coming now. Over the last 13 games, Minnesota is just 6-6-1, with losses to Northeastern, St. Cloud State, and Wisconsin, all teams hovering around .500 (if not below .500).
Minnesota has lost one-goal games in this stretch. They haven't been blown out. In fact, of Minnesota's seven losses, six have been by a single goal. The Gophers are 4-6 in one-goal games.
This is still a very good, very talented, very tough, and very dangerous team. The Gophers play a pretty tough second-half schedule, starting this weekend at rival North Dakota. Minnesota also plays road series at Nebraska Omaha and Denver, while hosting Colorado College.
UMD, meanwhile, has done little wrong over the last 16 games. The Bulldogs have faced two-goal deficits three times, rallying to tie two of those games and win the other. UMD has allowed the first goal seven times total in 16 games.
Simply put, the Bulldogs look unstoppable at this point. Things change, but coach Scott Sandelin has the team clicking in all areas, and unlike previous UMD teams, this one looks like one that can score at will five-on-five.
The Bulldogs are also showing superior conditioning, repeatedly wearing down teams and grinding out wins in the third periods of games. Over this stretch of 16 straight without a loss, UMD has outscored its opposition 27-10, including 6-0 in a weekend sweep of Western Michigan last week in Kalamazoo.
In those same 16 third periods, UMD senior captain and Hobey Baker favorite Jack Connolly has eight goals and ten assists for 18 points, an incredible run of third-period success.
Are the Bulldogs peaking right now? It's hard to say. UMD is playing with a lot of confidence, but the players are not over-confident. They believe in themselves, but yet appear to be taking nothing for granted, in practice or in games.
Any time you get a team this hot, the worry is that they are not peaking at the right time. An experienced group of players and coaches, however, is not likely to allow such a thing to happen. It seems UMD is in this for the long haul, and with more balance across the scoring lines, and more balance in the offense they're getting from the defensemen, it could be argued Sandelin actually has a better team than the one he won the whole thing with last year.
UMD and Minnesota do not play again during the regular season, and any future meetings would likely be contested at the XCel Energy Center in St. Paul, either at the WCHA Final Five, or at the NCAA West Regional the following weekend.
Or both.
One thing is abundantly clear. With these two teams tied at 22 points in league play, there's no chance that the league title race is over yet. And with Colorado College finally healthy and at full strength, there's no doubt the Tigers -- and possibly the likes of Nebraska Omaha, Denver, and North Dakota -- will insert themselves into this race if UMD, Minnesota, or both were to falter in the next few weeks.

With the Major League Baseball All-Star game taking place last night – which signifies the halfway point of the professional baseball season – Virginia Tech will peak into where and what its current and former players have done so far this summer. Below is a listing of their efforts and follow them on your own by clicking here.
Playing in the Cape Cod League for the Harwich Mariners, Andrew Rash has 10 hits and six RBI in 13 games, while Joe Mantiply has thrown 12.2 innings in three starts with 16 strikeouts and Devin Burke struck out 15 in 17.2 innings.
Playing in the Coastal Plain League is five Tech players, which includes Charlie McCann, who has thrown five innings in three relief appearances and has allowed just one run for the Outer Banks Daredevils.
In the same league, playing for the Peninsula Pilots, Zac MacAneney has 23 hits, 13 runs and 10 RBI in 24 starts and has stolen a team-high 14 bases. Chad Pinder has 20 hits, including three triples and a home run, 20 runs, nine RBI and has 14 walks in 21 starts. Jake Atwell has 15 starts, 14 hits and 10 runs scored.
On the mound, Patrick Scoggin is 1-1 with 29 innings pitched in 14 appearances (three starts) with a team-high 35 strikeouts. MacAneney has thrown two scoreless innings with two strikeouts, while Atwell has 13 strikeouts in 12 innings pitched.
In the New England League, six Hokies are spread across three teams, with Tyler Horan blasting a team-high six home runs for the Danbury Westerners, which is also tied for the league lead. He is batting .299 with 20 hits, 19 RBI and 11 runs. Also on the team, Chad Morgan is hitting .333 with 18 hits and 10 RBI with one home run. Click here for a recap of a game from the other night featuring the two Hokies.
Playing for the Mystic Schooners, Ricky Hodges has 13 strikeouts in 15.2 innings all out of the pen (11 appearances) and has five saves. Colin O’Keefe has 15.1 innings pitched in four starts with eight strikeouts. Both are 0-1 and have allowed just six earned runs. At the plate, Gabe Ortiz has 16 hits in 20 games, is second on the team with 14 RBI and three home runs and is third in runs scored with nine.
Lastly, Eddie Campbell has been lights-out for the Newport Gulls, posting a miniscule 0.55 ERA in 16.1 innings pitched. He is 2-1 in seven games (one start) and has 13 strikeouts.
In the Valley League, Jake Joyce has tossed 26.1 innings for the Covington Lumberjacks in five appearances (four starts) and has 23 strikeouts and a 2-1 record. Clark Labitan has appeared in just three games for the ‘Jacks.
Kyle Wernicki is batting .309 for Jersey Pilots in the Atlantic League and is among his team’s leaders in hits (21) and runs (11).
Johnny Morales has struck out just five times in 99 at-bats for the Orange County Pioneers of the California Collegiate League. He has 20 hits, 14 runs and has stolen five bases.
Morales will play in the CCL’s 2011 All-Star Game, which will be played tonight, the first Hokie named to a team this summer. Three leagues, the Coastal Plain (July 18), New England (July 27) and Cape Cod (July 29), have yet to play their leagues’ All-Star games.
On the professional front:
Joe Parsons picked up his first win last night after two relief innings and is now 1-0 with two saves in seven games for the GCL Pirates. He has struck out five batters in eight innings.
Tim Smalling has batted .458 over his last five games to raise his batting average to .318 for the Tri-City Dust Devils. In 19 games played, he has team-highs in runs scored (20) and doubles (8) and has 27 hits and 11 RBI.
Also playing for the Dust Devils, Rhett Ballard is 2-0 with a 3.60 ERA in 15.0 innings pitched (nine appearances) and has six strikeouts.
Ben Rowen is 1-2 with a 3.33 ERA for the Hickory Crawdads. In 14 games, he has thrown 27.0 innings and struck out 23 batters.
Leading the Great Lakes Loons with a .330 batting average is Steve Domecus, who has 33 hits in 30 games with 17 runs, three home runs and 11 RBI. He also leads the team with a .490 slugging percentage.
Justin Wright was 5-1 with a 1.26 ERA in 17 games out of the pen for Quad Cities River Bandits. He had 54 strikeouts in 35.2 innings pitched and was named a Midwest League All-Star before being promoted to the Florida State League.
Austin Wates is batting .588 over his last four games raising his average to .314 with a team-high 111 hits in 87 games for the Lancaster JetHawks. His 59 runs, 52 RBI, 152 total bases and five triples are second on the team, while he is third in doubles and stolen bases (15 each).
Steven Bumbry started the season in the South Atlantic League, but after nine games moved on to the Frederick Keys of the Carolina League. He has 48 hits in 64 games, with 38 runs and 17 RBI. He was named the Carolina League Player of the Week on June 13.
Warren Schaeffer spent 40 games in Double-A before just last week being promoted to the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League and has made the most of it so far. In just four games, he has five hits, including a 3-for-4 effort with two doubles and an RBI in a July 9 game.
Kevin Barker is still going strong in his 13th year in professional baseball. He was recently named a Mexican League All-Star and is among the team’s leaders with a .353 batting average with 98 hits, 54 runs and 11 home runs, and leads the team with 65 RBI and 30 doubles.
It has been an interesting summer for Wyatt Toregas, who started the season with the Indianapolis Indians, was called up for a week by the Pittsburgh Pirates and played in three games, but has been back with the Triple-A club since June 16.
Lastly, Joe Saunders has improved his numbers since the first month of the season (0-3, 5.93 ERA) to post a 6-7 mark at the break with a 3.86 ERA in 112 innings of work (18 starts) and 64 strikeouts. In his last five games for the Diamondbacks, he had four quality starts and won his last three decisions. He is 2-0 in July with a 1.50 ERA.

Wonderful 5ct Georgian Paste Cluster Ring Circa 1800’s.
The ring consists of a cluster of paste stones that weight in total approximately 5ct and are all set in cut down sliver settings.
All of the paste stones are still nice and bright and still have lots of sparkle.
The dimensions of the head of the ring are 19mm by 20mm.
There is a pattern shank on the ring that tests as 15ct yellow gold and is currently sized a British P / USA 7½ but could be resized up or down by us free of charge.
The ring is in very good condition with no visible damage and is still in a very wearable condition and looks fantastic when worn as the paste stones really catch the light and sparkle.

As Love Actually begins we are told that perhaps the world isn't such a dire and hateful place that "love actually is all around." Around London anyway. The film explores no less than seven different romantic scenarios within the bustling British capital--all of which interconnect and eventually resolve on Christmas Eve. There's the newly elected dashing Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) who is smitten with his secretary the earthy Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); Karen (Emma Thompson) whose husband Harry (Alan Rickman) has strayed with his seductive secretary Mia (Heike Makatsch); Sarah (Laura Linney) the American wallflower who has a crush on her colleague Carl (Rodrigo Santoro); Jamie (Colin Firth) who falls for his pretty Portuguese housekeeper Aurelia (Lucia Moniz)…there are lots more but you get the gist. As love goes things may not get tied up neatly in brightly colored packages for everyone but there's still enough good cheer to spread around.
Showcasing some of Britain's finest actors Love Actually doesn't have a bad banana in the bunch. Floppy-haired Hugh Grant turns in an endearing performance and proves there isn't a romantic comedy he can't handle. He has an uncanny knack for connecting with any actress he happens to be romancing; in this case it's the adorable McCutcheon best known for the hit British TV drama EastEnders. Rickman and Thompson are quite good as the couple whose long-term marriage is beginning to crack; Thompson especially does a nice job trying to hide her pain while being a happy mom. Linney too shines as Sarah who glows with excitement when she finally gets what she so ardently wished for. Veteran stage and film actor Bill Nighy (Underworld) however steals the show as a carefree aging rock star desperate for a comeback. His Billy Mack smacks of Mick Jagger Keith Richards and Rod Stewart all rolled into one.
"I'm worried that we don't have the word 'massacre' in the title " writer/director Richard Curtis fretted to Entertainment Weekly referring to how horror-loving American audiences might not take to his new romantic comedy that is already a huge hit in Britain. True perhaps a romantic comedy starring a multitude of A-list British actors might not bring in the required masses. But who cares about the money (did I just say that)? Curtis who has written some of the best romantic comedies of the last decade including Four Weddings and a Funeral Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary steps behind the camera for the first time here and is able to give each story a unique point of view from the lovesick to the wacky. There actually may be too many stories in Love Actually but it's a small gaffe. Love Actually is a refreshing good old fashioned warm and gushy movie that takes your mind off the bad things for the holiday season and Curtis should feel confident about his directing debut.

For nearly every major remodeling project in St. Louis, drywall installation is likely to show up at least once or twice. Versatile, durable, and relatively inexpensive, drywall is the most popular material for building interior walls all across the country for good reason. If you are thinking about a kitchen, living room, bedroom, or even bathroom remodel, your drywall installation can make a big difference in how the finished product looks, and even how it performs! While some handy homeowners might opt to do some or all of their own drywall installation, it is important to understand what you're getting into before you begin the project. Certainly, there are savings to be had by doing your own drywall instead of hiring a professional, but the challenging nature of this project often surprises do-it-yourselfers that have never done it before.
Hiring a Professional for St. Louis Drywall Installation
An experienced professional can make even difficult work seem easy, and few tasks illustrate this like drywall installation. St. Louis homeowners who have read books or watched videos that make installing drywall look easy may not know just how much practice this job takes to do well and efficiently. Professional drywall installers have learned through trial and error what makes a job go smoothly, and to watch one work can really be deceptive. As many homeowners have found out the hard way, creating an interior wall surface that is both functional and attractive can be extremely difficult (especially if you want it done quickly).
Professional St. Louis drywall installation companies have a few major advantages when compared to most DIYs. In many cases, the number of hands on a professional job is much higher than the amount of people working on DIY projects. This certainly means that the work can be done faster, but it also means that a professional crew will be able to take the time to make sure that everything is done properly. Many homeowners who hang their own drywall end up cutting corners, which results in a less than professional looking finished product. On the other hand, the pros do this job every day and are well aware of the problems that a few false moves in preparation, installation, or finishing can result in. The bottom line is this: when you hire a pro, you are getting the best in equipment, technique, and experience. Often, these are the things that separate a great drywall job from a disappointing one.
Give your walls a sharp, finished look! Use this link toInstall Drywall
Professional Drywall Finishing in St. Louis
It is true that some aspects of drywall installation are easier than others. Hanging the drywall, for example, allows a little more leeway for mistakes than drywall finishing. St. Louis homeowners who really need to save a buck and are willing to get their hands dirty (but don't want shabby looking results) might consider hanging their own drywall and leaving the finishing to the professionals. Handy homeowners who have done the job before successfully understand well the difficulty of drywall finishing, and many of the most experienced still prefer to leave the final step in the process to a professional crew!
St. Louis Drywall Installation Costs
Before you decide to do all or part of this job yourself, it is a good idea to take a look at just how much you'll save. St. Louis Drywall finishing is a labor intensive process, but a good crew can often do finishing very quickly; this means that if you do your own drywall hanging, the labor costs of hiring a crew for finishing could be very reasonable. To have a crew do the entire project from start to finish might seem a little costly (according to our numbers, the average cost of professional St. Louis drywall installation is about $2,250), but when you ad up the cost of purchasing the materials, transporting them, and enhancing your tool collection, it may turn out that the difference between hiring a pro and doing it yourself is less significant than you thought!

Awesome. I'll see you there. I'll be the guy with a beer in my hand
This section allows you to view all posts made by this member. Note that you can only see posts made in areas you currently have access to.
Two that were on the list that I would like to do someday.
Go to the GABF.
Go to Yakima at the time of the harvest.
I trust Alton Brown for any recipe I have never made before. He has never steered me wrong.
I am going to rebrew the beers that got passed on to the second round, taste them against the original beer and send the one that tastes better.
Are you saying that you can submit a beer from a different batch in the second round after you've read the comments?
Well, it's May 4th and first round results are not yet posted. Looks like Chicago is still processing. (whatever that means)
At least shipping to comps might be a bit cheaper.
I hope they do find a way to save the post office. I really can't imagine this country without it's postal system.
Paul
I've heard that Sierra Nevada changed their bottles from screw off caps to pry off caps just so theycould switch to O2 absorbing caps. Those guys know their sh*t.
I thought it was a new plastic that had 1/20th of the O2 getting in over time. There was a little said about it in the 2009 keynote at the NHC, and a graph. You can download it here, it is a little big.
I got the base recipe from "How to Cook Everything" by Mark Bittman. This is a handy volume on just about everything. I don't agree with everything in the book but it is useful. Then there's google for extra tips.
First (directed at an earlier post T made), I will not allow anyone to even waste my time signing up for the taste exam unless they have passed the entrance exam.
So, why would I take the entrance exam if I don't know if there's going to be an available tasting exam? I only see two tasting exams scheduled in my state in the next 18 months. Both only seat 12 people, and are already filled.
Are they going to expand the size of these now that it's tasting-only, instead of essays as well? Otherwise, it doesn't seem like there's an advantage to having the online exam.
I agree with Narvin. I don't see a reason to bother taking the entrance exam if the results will expire before you can get into a tasting exam. At the very least, your results should carry until the BJCP can provide the next level of testing, even if that's 18 months+ out.

Interesting Facts And Figures About Napa Valley Wineries
When you think about wine made in the United States, the Napa Valley region of California is often the first place that jumps in your mind. That’s not surprising when you realize that the county houses the country’s biggest collective vineyard acreage.
It’s also not surprising when you consider the popularity of home wine making kits, and the United States’ rank as the fourth largest wine producer in the world and second highest consumer of the beverage.
The first wine grapes were planted in Napa Valley in 1838, and since then the gorgeous region in northern California has grown into a premier tourist destination, and a great place to get high quality wine, of course.
Here are a few fun, interesting facts about grapes, wine, and wine making in actually combines to make up only 5% of the United States total vineyard acreage. That 5% produced around 9.2 million cases of wine per year.
-.
- There are around 400 wineries in Napa Valley, 300 of which have been built since 1966. Robert Mondavi was founded in that year, and was the first big winery to show up in the area since the Prohibition.
- It takes roughly 40,000 people to make the Napa Valley wine industry run efficiently, and the region nets about $10.128 billion in gross revenue from its wine.
- Despite attracting more than 4 million tourists each year, Napa Valley wineries only produce 4% of California’s total wine output every year. California also produces 90% of wine made in the United States.
These are just a few interesting facts about America’s most famous wine region. There are many more just waiting for you to find and bring up in conversation over a glass or two of wine from your wine making kit.

Warm and Eco-Friendly Braver House in Newton
If many years ago people were satisfied with some small houses which offered them the minimum comfort and living conditions, now their demands are more sophisticated and the tendencies are to create spacious houses.Still, the preferences are various and there are people who love small and warm houses and others who like big and comfortable living spaces.
Braver House is a nice building, located in Newton, USA which can definitely satisfy various tastes. SsD Architecture intended to create a building maximizing its perception of interior space and minimizing its physical appearance. The idea was to design a building which apparently does not cover too much of a surface but can offer a spacious and comfortable interior. There are two methods to achieve this thing: by expanding a diaphanous screen to the setback line expanding the territory of the interior to the exterior, and by shifting the plan and section to capture elongated views from inside to outside.
Those who love warm places will be definitely thrilled with this house. Its floor to ceiling windows increase the amount of natural light and the abundance of white adds more light and space. Still white is contrasted by natural wood color which is a dark brown.Here you can admire the airy bookshelves where you can deposit various objects too, the warm office corner or the spacious dining room which offers great views of the exterior. This room keeps the same nuances of white and brown even for the dining table.
The multitude of windows of different sizes create an interesting design for this building and helps the house get more and more natural light for all its interiors.Braver house is also a great eco-friendly building. The diminutive size of the house is coupled with a completely passive cooling system, a solar powered radiant heated floor and super insulated walls and roof.{found on archdaily and pics by Chang Kyun Kim}.

ADT Security Systems Help Protect Your Home in Siegle
Get the peace of mind you and your family deserve with an ADT home security system in Siegle
It’s better to be proactive than reactive. You never know when an emergency situation is going to arise in your home. However, ADT security systems can help you prevent and respond to them when they happen. As America’s leading home security provider, ADT can provide you with the necessary tools and services to prepare for burglary, fire, medical, flood, carbon monoxide and freeze emergencies. Get an ADT alarm system to help protect the people and things you value most.
Call today for a FREE consultation with an ADT Security expert
One of ADT Security’s great offers is a FREE consultation for all new customers. This is a chance for you to speak with someone who cares as much about your family’s safety as you do. Your expert consultant is a great source of information – from home safety tips to matching you with the right ADT system. Ask questions, gain insight and have a conversation with a real person. When shopping for home security systems, it’s important to get the package that’s right for you. Consultants are trained to properly advise people on which systems would be right for them.
Call 1-877-228-4479 right now to get started with your own ADT alarm system in Siegle.
Why get an ADT alarm system?
ADT has the most experience – more than 130 years in fact. ADT is also America’s #1 home security provider and the largest single provider of electronic security services across North America. Furthermore, you can get the following with ADT security systems:
- Monitoring 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
- Easy-to-use and intuitive ADT alarm systems
- Low monthly monitoring fees and opportunities to save in other ways
- Complete coverage from burglary, fire, medical, flood, carbon monoxide and freeze
- The best protection from the best provider
ADT’s reputation and service is impossible to beat. That’s why 90% of the Fortune 500 companies, all federal courthouses, the White House and Fort Knox trust ADT to help protect their property, people and valuables. If places like these are confident in ADT, you can be too. For the most trusted name in home security, call a representative today to get an ADT alarm system in your home.
Professional installation of ADT security systems
When your technician comes out to your home, he or she will professionally install your ADT security system and each additional feature you’ve added. ADT Security has more than 6,000 installers and service technicians across the United States who install more than 80 ADT security systems every hour.
With ADT’s professional installation, you will also get a tutorial on how everything works. When your technician is done installing your ADT alarm system, he or she will show you and your family how to operate everything. This is a great time to ask questions and familiarize yourself as much as possible with your new system.
Be sure to test your ADT alarm system periodically to make sure it’s properly working. ADT recommends you do this at least once a month. Simply follow the instructions in your owner’s manual. While ADT provides you with a backup battery that automatically activates during a power loss and powers your system for up to 24 hours, you should also periodically check on your primary battery.
Paying for your ADT home security system is easier than ever
When you call, be sure to ask about installation deals in your city. Select from the city list above to learn more about the options in your area.
It’s easy to pay for ADT security systems. You have the option of paying monthly or quarterly. You can also pay for your system via traditional mail or online. If you’d like to save money on stamps, save paper and limit paper clutter, sign up for online bill pay. Simply create an account online for this eco-friendly method to pay for your ADT service.

Sally Cox is a Hoopshaker
Hoopshaker is on a mission to introduce more people to the benefits of working out with hula hoops in 2012. She’s become a full-time hoop instructor and runs fitness classes in Portsmouth, Havant and Stubbington, UK. She told The News, “It’s a core exercise so it’s targeting the tummy although we do work the arms, legs and bum too. You can burn 100 calories in 10 minutes and it’s fun. It keeps you motivated because even when you think you can’t do it, you can. Everyone can do it with a bit of time and the right hoop. I’ve got people who’ve dropped a dress size and it’s good for your posture and confidence.”

Things You’ll Need:
VMWare Server (free version)
copSSH, or added SSH Server
BitVise Tunnelier, or added SSH client
A excess ape of Windows (2000/XP/2003)
1
Login to your VPS. Typically, you bequeath do this by Remote Desktop above the internet. Once logged in, download and ensconce the absolve copSSH server.
2
Open up the firewall on your VPS to accede arriving desires to cpSSH. By default, copSSH listens on Anchorage 22. For collateral reasons, I would closely advise altering this Anchorage to anything else.
3
Configure the abuser you bequeath use to adjoin to cpSSH. For abuser authentication, I would advise by certificates. cpSSH comes among utilities to bear a base CA as of which you can self-sign certs. If background up certificate-based verification is foreign to you, you can even use username-password authentication. It is dispassionate a diminutive below secure.
4
On the civic processor to you bequeath use to adjoin to the VPS, download and ensconce the absolve VMWare Server software. Use account 1.0 if stil accessible as it is further light than account 2.0.
5
Create a relative appliance among concerning 256MB RAM and 8GB of circle space. The relative lattice adapter on the VM can too be Bridged or NAT’ed. However, to avert certain budding difficulty (that I won’t descibe here) use a NAT’ed relative adapter. Install a unclothed along ape of Windows (2000/XP/2003 Web) in this VM. Turn off all services, counting Workstation, Server, Remote Desktp and NetBIOS above TCP/IP. Basically, you don’t absence the VM to be listening on any Anchorage to you absence to burrow to the VPS. It too helps if you allot your VM the similar Windows omputer autograph as your VPS.
6
Log in to the VM and download and ensconce BitVise Tunnelier, an SSH customer to is accessible for absolve for non-business use. In my opinion, this is one the most excellent SSH consumers available. Configure the customer to adjoin to the CopSSH headwaiter on your VPS.
7
Configuring client-to-server forwarding of desirable ports by SSH tunnel
Determine the IP abode of the VM. By default, this is active and assigned by VMWare’s DHCP server, but almost it on no account changes if not you add extra VMs and/or adapters. Once you bear the IP, on the C2S tab of BitVise address any ports to you absence as of the VM’s IP abode to the VPS’s IP address. Some excamples:139 – Windows binder sharing,1433 – SQL Server,3389 – Remote Desktop
8
Once C2S forwarding is setup, you can right of entry folks ports as although they were defenseless on the civic VM’s relative adapter. For the examples I provided in the bygone step, you don’t addiction to configure S2C forwarding. For further advanced setups anyplace you bear an appliance on your civic crowd listening for acquaintances as of the VPS, you bequeath too addiction to configure S2C forwarding.

"Will return to this Hotel."Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest on Jun 25, 2012
There is a lot of construction around this area. The hotel was nice and we like the closeness to the areas we wanted to visit while in Hangzhou. It is close to a very nice mall where you can shop as well as eat. It's within walking distance to West Lake as well. We will use this hotel again.

"Good service and location of hotel"Reviewed by Victoria VN of "Singapore" on Oct 28, 2011
The hotel is conveniently located in downtown area of Hangzhou..u can easily find restaurants and convenient store nearby. Besides, it just took 15-20min to Xihu lake by cab ;one of Hangzhou's famous tourist attractions. It only cost us RMB15-17. They also have English-speaking staff who's very helpful...it's especially very helpful to us as we don't speak mandarin well. I would definitely love to stay there again anytime I drop by Hangzhou..

"Enjoyed stay at Zhejiang International Hotel"Reviewed by Eugene A of "Singapore" on Apr 20, 2011
I stayed 2 nights at this hotel. Arriving late at past midnight, the hotel was dim and only had 1 staff mending the counter. The procedures for check in was slow as the staff had to copy all the information for every guest (I booked 2 rooms for 4 adults). They could have photocopied the passport and do the paperwork after the guests leave the counter. Hotel room is very new and well maintained. I ordered room service and the food arrived after about 30 minutes. The food was ok. There was no complimentary bottled water in the room though and only a tap that provides drinking water. The breakfast spread (not included in the hotel rate) is somewhat limited and not the best. The staff at the concierge were extremely helpful though, giving tips and guide on where to visit and what to see and which route to take for first time Hangzhou visitors like me, who didn't do much research before hand. Location wise, it is located in downtown but away from Xihu, the main tourist attraction. It is walking distance from the shopping malls (the bigger dept store being YingTai).
""Reviewed by grace C of "Houston, Texas" on May 14, 2010
It is clean and well maintained facility. Fitness center is adequate. Services is good. Location is convenient to access to major shopping malls. But rate is high without including breakfast by booking through Hotel.com

"Reasonable only"
Very noisy room from the main road belowGenuine Hotels.com guest review
"Very difficult to locate"
The hotel itself was nice and service was good. Finding the hotel is almost impossible due to one way streets, and general lack of signage. I spent 90 minutes looking for the hotel and during that time was never more than 1 mile form it. You can not see the sign for the hotel from anywhereGenuine Hotels.com guest review
"No frills"
LOcation of hotel good. Nothing within the hotel to convince me to go back. Poor, cold, bar area, No entertainment facilities within hotel, just basic, no frills, business accomadation.Genuine Hotels.com guest review
"A short stay at the Legacy Preston International"
The hotel looks nice; it is clean and well-maintained. On our visit the staff were friendly and helpful. On the downside, the breakfast room is in the basement and though its very clean and pleasant, there is a musty smell that suggests damp. My biggest complaint though, would be that the bed was very hard and uncomfortable. This meant that I did not […] sleep well for the two nights I was there and on the 250 mile journey home, I was very tired. Read moreGenuine Expedia guest review
Overall my stay was ok. The only thing I would say let the hotel down was the terrible food in the resteraunt. I paid 20.00 for what tasted like a microwave chilli and a tinned sticky toffee pudding. I think for people who stay in your hotel will be workers and after a day at work you would like nice food .Genuine Hotels.com guest review
"ordinary"
Not particularly cheap. Food bland and expensive. Staff friendly and reasonably helpful, though. Overall, very disappointed and will stay elsewhere next time.Genuine Hotels.com guest review
"Ok. Functional but nothing exciting."
Clean. Good location for town centre but difficult to drive to because on a one way system. Sat nav doesn't take you there! Room warm. No air-con and window wouldn't open. Breakfast average. Plenty of parking.Genuine Hotels.com guest review
"Hotel With No Personality"
The hotel was fine, however bothe the staff and the hotel has no personaslity!Genuine Hotels.com guest review
"Good, clean hotel"
I stayed for 3 nights. Nice, clean room with all basic equipment you need, including free WiFi. Spacious shower room with tub. I was pleased with the stay itself, but I cannot say much about other things and services the hotel offers, since I didn't use any. I had a late dinner at the hotel's lounge "restaurant" on a saturday evening, I was the only […] customer there at the time which made me a little suspicious. The food was quite ok and eatable, but nothing I would count on on any fancier occasions.

This is my 4th stay, and probably last, in this hotel in the last 15 months The food quality went down from 4-star to 2 to 3 star within the last 4... months. The resort itself is still very nice and clean, but the food (which used to be above par) is now no better than the average other 3-star resorts in this area. Gone are the mini-lobsters, chocolate fondue, fresh seafood, etc. etc. Each day is now the same bland food. In fact, the pasta section which used to be the lower-quality compared to everything else they served, is now head and shoulders above the rest. (And the pasta has NOT changed since last time...) by a Hotels.com guest on 07/04/12

Samsung F1080 Upscaling DVD player £35.00
Selling our Upscaling DVD player, not used much in the bedroom since we noticed we can pick up some freeview channels!
Is in very good condition, I am a bit obsessive with looking after things. It comes with the power lead and a remote control. I'm pretty sure I've got the booklet somewhere and possibly a scart cable but will have to have a bit of a dig around. I should find them.
It's a good little player, looks really sleek and upscales nicely. Has a HDMI output port too. The buttons on the actual unit are all touch activated. Plays DIVX and MPEG4 videos.
Shipping/Payment: PPG preferred. Will send via courier (not done that before!) or royal mail.

Thoroughbred Houseboats built a boat for Kentucky State University that Daytona International Speedway and the Duck Dynasty crew will be using on Lake Lloyd February 23-24. Lake Lloyd is infield of the Daytona 500 so the Quack Pack will be on the boat spending time enjoying the Florida sun, doing some fishing and watching the race. Willie, Korie, Si and Kate will all be making an appearance. Some lucky fans will even win passes to take a ride on the boat and meet the gang! You can enter by checking out the “Duck Dynasty” “activations at Midway and Sprint fan zone at the speedway.
Duck Dynasty is a reality television series on A&E. The popular show follows the lives of the Robertson family, who became wealthy from their family-operated business, Duck Commander. The company makes a lot of products for duck hunters, primarily the duck call named Duck Commander. The Robertson men, brothers Phil and Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep, are featured with their trademark long-flowing beards.
The business began in a dilapidated family shed, where Phil Robertson spent 25 years making duck calls from Louisiana cedar trees. His son Willie is now the CEO of the company.

For a couple from Calgary, standing on Qualicum Beach on Vancouver Island initially felt like a world away from home.
But it didn’t take long for that to change.
The breathtaking Georgia Strait is only steps away from Bob and Jane White’s new backyard in a nearby community called Qualicum Landing.
“I actually didn’t think there was a view like that in Canada,” says Jane, a retired school teacher.
Qualicum Landing is a 62-residence community stretched across 6.4 hectares of waterfront just north of Qualicum Beach on Vancouver Island.
After living in Calgary for the past 35 years, the Whites sold their city residence and made the gated luxury beach community their permanent home.
The Whites learned about the B.C. retreat while reading the Calgary Herald, with one visit to the resort cinching their interest in a long-term stay.
“It’s gorgeous,” says Jane about the walk-on waterfront, which has about 450 feet of shoreline. “The sunsets and sunrises are absolutely spectacular.”
With Qualicum Landing being the only multi-family development in the area, the scenic beach has an exclusive feeling, says Lynn Robison, sales director for Qualicum Landing.
She’s also a resident at the property.
“Once you get on that beach, you’re virtually by yourself,” she says, adding that many residents beachcomb and return with an assortment of interesting treasures. “You can walk for miles and miles.”
Another appeal is the community’s low-density layout, says Robison.
“It allows you to have your own home,” she says. “You’re not looking into your neighbour’s patio when you’re trying to barbecue.”
Residences range in size from 1,070 to 2,000 square feet. The smallest unit includes two bedrooms and the largest has three bedrooms and a den.
Pricces start at $399,000.
“We finish them to luxury home standards,” says Robison. Features include the buyer’s choice of two designer colour schemes, a heritage-style front door made of solid wood, and imported, hand-laid tile in the entranceway and bathrooms.
They also include Shaker-style cabinets, stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, designer series plumbing fixtures, crown moulding in the great room, and a heated single-car garage.
The Whites bought a three-bedroom, Cape Cod-themed residence with 12-foot ceilings. “Every square inch is cleverly designed,” says Jane, adding it includes large, “unbelievable” windows.
“The whole back end is all windows, which just brings the outside in,” she says.
The Whites are just one example of the wave of interest in Qualicum Landing coming from Calgary residents, says Robinson.
“Calgary has been really good to us,” she says, adding that about 40 per cent of owners come from Alberta.
Young retirees and those looking for a vacation home as an investment are flocking to Qualicum Landing, says Robison.
Many of those who use their residence as a vacation home earn money by including it in the development’s rental program.
“There is high demand for rentals in Qualicum Landing,” says Robison. However, more than 50 per cent make the property their permanent residence, she says.
Part of what draws residents to the community are the number of amenities on Vancouver Island, including four provincial parks and six golf courses, says Robison.
The area also includes opportunities to dip into a town, with Comox Valley and Nanaimo within a 40-minute drive of the resort.
While there is much to do and see in the area outside of Qualicum Landing, the community, itself, isn’t short on things to enjoy.
They include an outdoor heated pool and hot tub surrounded by 0.4 hectares of green space.
There’s also a clubhouse with a fitness facility, owner’s lounge and billiard’s room. A sport court for basketball and tennis is planned for completion this fall, says Robison.
Construction is in progress on the 49th unit at Qualicum Landing. There are 13 residences left to sell at the development.

IN SHORT
Qualicum Beach is a small town about 12 kilometres north of Parksville, on the east side of Vancouver Island.
The area is known as a fisherman’s paradise, with waters populated by halibut and salmon. Qualicum is an anglicized take on the First Nations Salish word “squal-li,” which translates to “where the dog salmon run.”
Away from the beach, the region is known for its assortment of golf courses, mountain biking and hiking.
The vision for a gated beach community on Vancouver Island was driven by David Steele and Pat Delesalle, who are managing partners at Qualicum Landing.
Delesalle is a shareholder in the Queen Charlotte fishing lodge.
Steele has more than 17 years of experience in real estate development, directing sales for more than 85 projects in Canada and the United States.

Low interest rates and weak new mortgage volume continue to depress revenue at U.S. banks as the housing market begins tentative steps toward recovery, according to Standard & Poor's.
The picture is even worse considering these banks need higher reserves to cover representation and warranty claims made on previously originated mortgages.
Further, the ratings agency expects home prices, as measured by the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city index, to fall another 4%. Analysts in another department at S&P expect the index will decline about 1% for January. The next S&P/Case-Shiller report is due March 27.
"If the market does enter another downturn, as evidenced by a steeper decline in home prices than we currently project and an increase in new delinquencies, we could take rating actions, depending on how it affects U.S. banks," said Matthew Albrecht, a credit analysts at Standard & Poor's.
As of the end of 2011, the banking stress index stood at 1.7, unchanged from the past two quarters, according to Institutional Risk Analytics. "This means that U.S. banks are still experiencing significantly elevated levels of operational stress compared with the benchmark year of 1995, which is equal to 1" in the BSI, said IRA.
Key in the fourth-quarter bank results was the drop in the number of "A+" rated institutions, the second time in 2011 that the trend toward improving bank results has shown signs of reversal, IRA said in a note published Thursday.
The first quarter of 2011 "is looking like the operational peak" of the U.S. banking industry during the age of the Federal Reserve's zero interest rate policy, the banking analytics firm said.
"The deterioration in earning assets in banks is accelerating, killing the profitability and lending capacity of U.S. banks in the same way that ZIRP is crushing savers."

Commentary
Bruce Rose and his wife Rosemary consider themselves giving people. Their foundation, Carrington Charitable, last year raised $500,000 on the golf course. The beneficiary of the proceeds, the Veterans Airlift Command, arranges transportation by private jet for severely wounded veterans and their families.
Rose sometimes donates flight time on the planes owned and operated by his many real estate companies under the Carrington hedge fund umbrella. On occasion, the commercial-certified pilot will fly the mission himself.
And then there was the time when the Extreme Home Makeover television show approached Carrington with an opportunity to “do the right thing.” On the show, a disadvantaged, disabled couple in the Midwest was living in a home whose mortgage was serviced by Carrington Mortgage Services. The producers asked if Carrington could help at all — a discount on the mortgage payment, perhaps some construction service (Rose also operates White Van property preservation) — even though the mortgage was current at the time of filming.
For Rose it was a no-brainer. Carrington bought the mortgage out of the trust using company funds and donated the note to the couple. There is even a 15-second clip of a Carrington associate dramatically tearing up the mortgage for the cameras.
“The interesting thing about it though, was we weren’t named anywhere in the show,” said Bruce Rose, reflecting on the moment in a rare media interview. “There was no reference to Carrington, there was no advertising and we didn’t ask for any credit. And when I had the chance to play the clip again for a town hall meeting internally, the message I gave to the troops was that you always do the right thing, even when nobody’s watching,” he added.
“And everybody gets it — we didn’t tear up that mortgage because we were doing it for the credit or for the advertising or to get Carrington’s name out there,” he said. “We did it because it was the right thing to do, it felt good and it helped out a family that really deserved the help. That’s the way the company is run — that’s the philosophy we’ve always approached everything with.”
It’s a side of Carrington not many people know.
Rose gets enough comfort out of it. He has no trouble sleeping at night. He has no regrets. He’s comfortable with his place in the world, and can balance the pros and cons life throws at him. In all, he’s a very likeable person.
Yet his company can rub some people the wrong way, even when it is operating for the right reasons. For this, Rose never apologizes, never backs down and has come out on top, nearly each and every time. Rose, for his part, will tell you it comes down to the business practices that underpin Carrington.
“Our company has done everything that it can do for the best benefit of the borrower-investor longer term. Where we think it’s somewhere between ironic and amusing, is while we were working as hard as possible to keep borrowers in the houses and keep the assets cash flowing, right outside our doors and right outside my home we were being picketed by the ACORNs and the NACAs of the world, and then simultaneously in the press we were crucified by Declaration, Magnetar and analysts like Amherst for not foreclosing fast enough.”
Magnetar is the now-infamous Chicago-based hedge fund accused of manipulating collateralized debt obligations. Investors filed suit in April in an effort to claw back some losses. Declaration Management & Research remains in business as a Securities and Exchange Commission registered investment adviser managing approximately $10 billion in institutional assets. Austin, Texas-based Amherst Securities operates as a broker-dealer in residential mortgage-backed securities, agency securities and select fixed-income investments, and the company’s research team is among the most influential in the mortgage industry.
“We could kind of take the middle of the road and say ‘Well if we’re irritating everybody, we must be doing a good job.’ But what I think was the most gratifying from my perspective is then a few years later when the noise died down, we watched ACORN shoot itself in the head, it became evident that NACA was nothing more than a shakedown for fees from us, as was ACORN originally.”
Neighborhood activist the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, filed for bankruptcy at the end of 2010 in the wake of videos showing employees recommending immoral borrower behavior. Its final office closed in May 2012. The Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America still provides housing counseling services but has been criticized for allegedly trying to strong-arm mortgage bankers into reworking lower-income mortgages.
If there is a winner to any of these contentious and sensitive issues, that person is Bruce Rose.
INVESTORS AND TROUBLE
Earlier this year, things came to a very Carrington-esque conclusion. The hedge fund and American Home Mortgage Servicing, now known as Homeward Residential, agreed to settle a three-year dispute over how REO tied to a subprime mortgage bond was managed. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Rose said the common misperception outside of Carrington was that there was one central lawsuit between Carrington and American Home over servicing practices. There was more than one suit, he said, but the original case involved Carrington suing Homeward Residential.
Carrington was the plaintiff, and not the defendant, in the initial lawsuit filed in March 2009 — a misunderstanding for some who believe it was the other way around. Carrington had negotiated a provision embedded in its pooling and servicing agreements called the “rights of the CE holder.” This is in reference to the investor that holds most of the riskiest credit enhancement tranche, or so-called “residual class.”
This CE rights provision allowed Carrington to control the foreclosure and REO disposition process on every loan it purchased from any of the originators. Rose maintains nothing was conducted behind-the-scenes. The rights of the CE classholder were fully disclosed in the investment prospectus, in the PSA and, Rose said, discussed widely with investors that bought into Carrington’s issuance in the primary market.
When American Home Mortgage Servicing acquired Option One Mortgage in April 2008, the Dallas-Fort Worth-based servicer acquired rights to service loans in Carrington-led securitizations. Option One had been flawlessly following Carrington instructions for the life of the securitization, Carrington alleges in the lawsuit. The lawsuit resulted when AHMSI allegedly neglected to maintain the CE holder’s rights, according to filings with the Connecticut Superior Court. Rose said he felt he had little choice but to go to court.
“In order to protect our investors, our bond holders and our invested capital, we took the dispute to the courts,” Rose said.
“American Home (now Homeward) responded with a lawsuit against me personally,” Rose claims.
The second lawsuit, which alleged racketeering, was filed by American Home in early 2009 and announced in the press but was quickly withdrawn in May 2009, according to court documents. It received media coverage by journalists who labeled the dispute an example of “tranche warfare.”
“I think what generally got blown out of proportion was that this was a simple contract dispute between Carrington as plaintiff and American Home as defendant,” Rose said. “We didn’t spend five seconds responding to American Home’s lawsuit back to us. It was dismissed and it’s gone.”
Rose describes the whole event as a triumph, and a simple contract dispute that got blown out of proportion. Carrington’s internal operations and leadership, meanwhile, remain big fans of both the people and work at Homeward Residential, Rose said. Rose’s firms still provide real estate services for Homeward, both as a vendor and a counterparty. But the American Home dispute was not the only time business relationships have landed Rose and Carrington in court.
“With respect to investor complaints, I have one investor that represents slightly less than 10 basis points of our overall invested capital … that claimed that he had special rights to withdraw capital at a point in time when he didn’t,” Rose said. He declined to identify the investor.
“That particular lawsuit, the only one that’s arisen from the investor side, is proceeding nicely in our favor. And I’m not going to say that I don’t care, but it’s not something that I spend a lot of time thinking about,” Rose said. If this conversation were happening on Twitter, one half-imagines Rose would end it with the hashtag #winning.
Rose estimates there have been probably 100 to 200 borrower lawsuits against Carrington, none of which have resulted in any significant action or settlement with Carrington, he said. Most of the suits were inherited from defunct subprime lender New Century Financial that Carrington now services for other investors.
There’s also former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray’s now-dismissed lawsuit against Carrington for alleged noncompliance with a consent decree involving now-defunct subprime lender New Century. In May 2007, Carrington paid $188 million to buy New Century’s servicing rights. Cordray, meanwhile, moved into the director position at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and his replacement, Mike DeWine, dismissed the suit.
“That covered something less than 7% of the total number of loans that we serviced in the state of Ohio,” Rose said. “The state AG that filed that lawsuit was voted out of office. His successor came into office, and within a short couple of months, dismissed the lawsuit, no action, nothing required out of Carrington. We’re now proud to serve the people of Ohio with real estate, lending and property services.”
GENERATING RETURNS
The stated goal for Carrington’s invested capital is to generate a return based on the ability to manage mortgage credit risk. And mortgage credit risk is nowhere more evident than in the lowest classes of the security, typically the first to absorb any credit losses. So Carrington intentionally created and retained as much of the credit risk as it could, and structured its securitizations to make sure that Carrington can control mortgage credit risk as much as possible.
It’s all part of the plan. “By the way, I think it’s important to note that while we were the first to create a provision known as the “rights of the CE holder,” that’s more or less become standard in any of the residential securitizations that’s taken place post-apocalypse here,” Rose said.
“We expect to see it built into virtually every non-agency securitization that comes out in the future,” he adds. “The guy who creates the risk and who retains it on balance sheet is ultimately going to want to retain the ability to control it — that we started demonstrating as early as 2004.”
That same control of credit risk by a single classholder, analysts at Amherst had argued, may give a servicer differing incentives to behave, which may in turn prove counterproductive to investors. Rose argues this is nonsense. Consider that each class in the security represents an undivided interest in the entire pool of loans, Rose begins. “Even though we bought and retained the credit risk that was at the bottom of the securitization, we owned a vertical slice of every loan throughout the entire trust,” he said.
“So it’s not that we put the riskier loans down at the bottom and we sold the safer loans at the top. Think of it this way: You put all the loans in a giant bucket and you mix them around until they’re kind of homogenous and they don’t really have any individual identity,” Rose explains. What Carrington ends up doing is selling pieces out of that bucket where all the loans are mixed together and the most important part about that is an investor, at various levels, participates in kind of the weighted average performance of all the loans. This happens all the way across the spectrum, except that the investor can choose how safe he wants his investment to be.
So by choosing the top level at AAA, the probability that an investor will incur credit risk is very remote. But by choosing the bottom noninvestment grade, the investor is going to receive the maximum impact of any credit. At least, this is what Carrington claims. And there is no shortage of investors as a result.
“Where certain classes of investors and analysts got it wrong, is they viewed the obligation of the servicer and the trustee to protect duration, the length of time that each of these notes were outstanding,” Rose argues.
Rose makes the case that his structured deals are typically more credit-enhanced, have more subordination, and more excess cash flow available to the more senior bondholders than most of what is still out there in nonagency mortgage securities land. But this is not by a substantial margin, and certainly not enough to attract suitcases full of cash to go to operational expenses.
“I think the edge that we had is when we bought loans, we were known as an extraordinarily difficult investor. We had a very intense diligence protocol. We bought virtually zero-exception loans in an environment that was based in exception-based lending. I guess we could say we bought the best of the production that was out there, but given that effectively that the entire market failed, there’s a little consolation in that,” Rose said. “Self-evident, we’re still here and our deals are still outstanding when just about everybody else is wiped out.”
THE AMERICAN DREAM — TO RENT
Carrington is betting on REO-to-rentals, big time. Privately-funded mortgage originations cratered in 2007 and 2008, but not before the easy liquidity of the nation’s housing boom gave a lot opportunities to a lot of people to buy houses. Directionally, the effort to lend more freely was aligned with both social policy and with where the government wanted to be — the American Dream of homeownership.
Homeownership rates in the U.S. peaked at 68% to 69% during 2006. Rose estimates that these rates will revert back to something that looks like the mean trend over time, and may overcorrect in the short term. “I know that the popular notion is that housing ownership probably descends down to 62% to 63%, we actually think it could get low as 59% to 60% over time. But it’s not a bad thing,” he said.
“We gave an opportunity for a whole class of people to buy houses — that was a good thing,” he said without a hint of regret. “The fact that some of them couldn’t perform isn’t necessarily their fault, isn’t necessarily the Street’s fault. The reliance on housing price appreciation to drive the whole equation effectively became the bubble that burst. Let’s get over it and move on.”
Moving on, a significant portion of those homeowners now make up the foreclosures coming onto the market (or soon-to-be on the market). And these now former homeowners are going to need a solid roof above their head, even if they can’t afford to buy or access available financing. Which seems to mean an increased demand for rentals; and, perhaps even, skyrocketing demand.
Carrington talks REO-to-rentals today, as it did back in 2009, when I first started at HousingWire. For all I know, the company talked about it even before that time. But the recent taboo of discussing renting to former boom-time homeowners is now the cocktail party chatter du jour. Carrington was there when it put those people into homes, and it will be there when they now need to rent, too.
And it’s in the rental market where Rose believes Carrington will likely encounter some additional friction on the road ahead of it.
“Virtually every high net-worth or single investor out there wants to buy a house and rent it out,” Rose said. “And the market is seeing a lot of the private equity types, a lot of distressed real estate money flooding toward this asset.”
Carrington, however, has some trepidation regarding the way the market is moving with these developments in mind.
“What we’re particularly concerned about is the trend of the larger investors to go out and buy courthouse-step sales, force the eviction of a borrower when they’re not a licensed servicer and trying to attack this trade with capital, as opposed to infrastructure and system,” Rose warned. “So I think there’s going to be some blowups. I think there’s going to be some mistakes. We’re trying to stay out of the fray. We’re not looking to take this public. We’re not looking for the get-rich quick. We’re not going to flip houses. We don’t consider this a two- or three-year investment. This is an ultra-long term hold. “
What Rose calls “the worst thing that this market will see” is if a bunch of the fast money rushes in and then flips the houses. This could lead to a double bounce on the bottom.
“The competition for assets in certain markets has already caused us to depart those markets. Where the investor perception is, ‘Gee it got really cheap so it must be distressed so I should buy it there,’ all of a sudden we’re seeing properties that are selling at 110% to 120% of list,” Rose said.
Carrington is currently operating rentals in 30-plus states — in 70 or so cities, Rose said. When determining how to treat an asset, Carrington uses a net present value equation on each individual asset that includes the forward curve projecting housing price (for sale) versus the net cash flow (for rentals).
If that calculation generates a positive return versus selling the house today, Carrington keeps the house. If it generates a negative return, the house gets sold.
However, in 2010, Carrington revised its internal housing price index. Upon revision, the company noticed many of the houses Carrington held as rentals would start to reach a negative NPV in a year or so.
“Our goal originally in 2007-2008, was to ride out until the recovery in the housing market, which we thought was going start to show some signs of relief sometime third or fourth quarter of 2010. Okay, guess what? I was wrong, but I don’t think I was the only one who was. “
“We sold occupied, well-maintained retail-priced houses, as opposed to selling through an REO agent that got a price for a vacant, boarded-up house,” Rose adds. “So ultimately between the value enhancement by having the house occupied and maintained, plus the cash flow from the net rental, delivered better overall proceeds to the trust, as opposed to just marking it down and selling it out.”
Rose estimates his company processed approximately 15,000 houses for Fannie Mae’s tenant-in-place program beginning in February, 2010, and it continues to work on the program with Fannie today as well. Carrington itself burned through 3,500 to 4,000 houses held in private securitizations it serviced. Carrington is also operating a tenant-in-place program for two major unnamed financial institutions, as well as participating in a joint venture with Oaktree Capital in Los Angeles to deploy an initial investment of nearly $500 million into the REO rental market.
So, one can disagree with the tactics of Rose, Carrington, and its vast array of subsidiaries (15 different companies operate under the Carrington umbrella, at last count). It’s not hard, after all, to have a quibble with one of the few institutions that banked during the boom, survived the bust and is continuing to push ahead during what so far has been an amazingly unsettling recovery. But Rose feels his business model has been vindicated, despite the criticism some loft his way.
“I think what’s important to note, that yeah, there’s criticism from consumer activist groups, there’s some criticism from the realty firms and so forth,” Rose said. “But we disagree.”

More than 12,000 children passed through the Theresienstadt ghetto in Czechoslovakia on their way to various concentration camps during the Holocaust. About 90 percent of them would go on to perish at the hands of the Nazis. Still, as the Holocaust Museum Houstons new exhibition Escaping Their Boundaries: The Children of Theresienstadt shows, they did manage to have brief moments of normalcy, courtesy of a group of adults who provided them with toys and games. The exhibition includes 40 objects, including collages, drawings, diaries, magazines, games and marionettes used or made by children of the ghetto (where 50,000 people were crammed into quarters meant for 7,000). While many of the never-before-seen drawings and diaries show the children were aware of the horrors surrounding them, hope and happiness can be glimpsed as well. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays; noon to 5 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.

The attributes of web controls declared using the ASP. NET syntax become the properties of the control, and Web developer.
The HTML controls have a one-to-one mapping with HTML tags and Web developer can create HTML controls and change their appearance by modifying their properties. HTML controls have an object model that closely resembles the HTML syntax of the elements, as well as the Dynamic HTML (DHTML) object model.
In ASP.NET there are two groups of HTML controls:
Web developer can declare other HTML tags as server-side controls by using the runat=”server” attribute/value pair. However, these controls are not supported; instead, unsupported HTML elements are handled by a generic super HTML server control called HtmlGenericControl. The HTML elements Web developer might typically handle in this way include <div>, <span>, <body>, and <font>.
HTML container controls
The base class for container controls is the HtmlContainerControl class, which descends directly from HtmlControl. The HTML elements addressed by this tag are elements that must have a closing tag—that is, forms, selection boxes, and tables, as well as anchors and text areas. Compared to the HtmlControl class, a container control features a couple of additional string properties—InnerHtml and InnerText.
Both properties manipulate the reading and writing of literal content found between the opening and closing tags of the element. Note that you cannot get the inner content of a control if the content includes server controls. InnerHtml and InnerText work only in the presence of all literal content. The tag itself is not considered for the output. Unlike InnerText, though, InnerHtml lets you work with HTML rich text and doesn’t automatically encode and decode text. In other words, InnerText retrieves and sets the content of the tag as plain text, whereas InnerHtml retrieves and sets the same content but in HTML format.
HTML Input controls
In HTML, the <input> element has several variations and can be used to provide a submit button as well as a check box or text box. In ASP.NET, each possible instance of the <input> element is mapped to a specific class. All input classes derive from the HtmlInputControl class. HtmlInputControl is the abstract class that defines the common programming interface for all input controls. The class inherits from HtmlControl and simply adds three custom properties—Name, Type, and Value—to the inherited interface.
The Name property returns the name assigned to the control. In ASP.NET, this property is peculiar because, although it’s marked as read/write, it actually works as a read-only property. The get accessor returns the control’s UniqueID property, while the set accessor is just void. As a result, whatever value Web developer assigns to the property, either programmatically or declaratively, is just ignored and no exception or compile error is ever thrown.
The Type property mirrors the type attribute of the HTML input elements. The property is read-only. Finally, the Value property is read/write and represents the content of the input field.

Understanding Photography Lighting with a Single Egg [Video]
In this informative video, veteran photographer Joe Edelman demonstrates the basics of photography lighting with a humble egg.
An egg is an excellent shape for experimenting with and studying lighting because the curved surfaces provide a nice clean gradient to study how the light wraps and falls as you move around the light source. Check out the video above to see Edelman’s full demonstration of the humble egg as a photography teaching tool.

Very cool concept. Wish the audio quality were better, though!
Thank you for that as many pieces make a photo it is Lighting, lighting, lighting that defines the end result. Just like in Real Estate, Location ditto ditto.
…this makes it all worthwhile cuz eggs are good food.
I mostly ignore eggs, but never lighting. Rule of thirds, depth of field, can often be ignored without too much damage, but ignore lighting? 99% of the time NO. Understand this concept and your photos’ll be much more appealing.
I mostly ignore concepts, because they hinder my raw talent.
Ha…I mostly ignore lighting whilst unconscious.
I also wonder if he regularly talks to his egg when he goes home at night.

Under the Radar: How to Pass a Drug Test for Marijuana
If you smoke weed and you need to know how to pass a drug test, I can tell you from personal experience that not only is it possible, it’s actually surprisingly easy.
On the other hand, that doesn’t mean there’s a Magic Pill out there, either. If you have your heart set on a miracle cure that doesn’t require any effort on your part, then keep looking (and good luck).
But if you have your act together enough to follow some simple, step-by-step instructions, then keep reading because you’re half-way there…
Of course smokers don’t pass bad information back and forth to each other on purpose. But think about it – if things like Certo, cranberry juice, niacin, vinegar, etc. actually worked, it would be well-known to pot smokers and shyster companies wouldn’t be able to sell millions of dollars worth of their detox products every year.
A lot of the home remedy gossip you hear about is based on tactics that actually worked to a certain degree in the very early days of drug testing. But drug testing labs have been on to these tactics for many years.
Marijuana detox products have a hit and miss track record, to put it mildly. And it’s no wonder, because detox kits don’t actually cleanse marijuana from your system at all.
This has got to be one of the biggest advertising frauds in history. It doesn’t matter how many expensive herbal remedies you take, or how many fancy drinks you chug down – they will never cleanse anything except your wallet. In my book I explain why it’s literally impossible anyway.
Detox products don’t have 300-500% money-back guarantees because they work so great. They come with guarantees like that because the companies who sell them know it will convince you to buy their product.
But good luck with getting them to pay up on those huge guarantees when you fail. It almost never happens, because they know you’re not likely to raise a stink and advertise to the world that you smoke pot. And unfortunately, they’re usually right.
Drinking lots of water will help you test negative for THC pretty easily, actually. For most smokers that’s not the hard part. But what good does it do you to test negative for drugs if the lab can tell that you diluted?? You end up failing anyway.
Most smokers think that drinking lots of water, cranberry juice or whatever for days/weeks/months before their drug test will help them pass. Because that’s what EVERYONE tells you to do, right? Unfortunately, ‘everyone’ is flat out wrong.
This belief is the biggest misconception there is about dilution, hands down. In “Under the Radar” you’ll learn why it’s not only false, but it can actually cause you to fail your urine drug test.
When it comes to diluting for a drug test, the ONLY water that matters is what you drink on the actual day of your test. So you can save yourself a lot of grief by waiting to dilute until it really matters.
What Is the ONE Method Guaranteed to Help You Pass Your Drug Test?
I apologize, but that’s actually a trick question. The fact is there’s absolutely nothing on this planet guaranteed to work 100% of the time for 100% of smokers. And anyone who tells you otherwise is flat out LYING to you – there’s no other way to put it.
So if you’re looking for a Magic Pill, that’s not a promise I can make. It wouldn’t be right, no matter how many charlatans are willing to sell their souls by promising you the moon.
HOWEVER — there’s one thing I can tell you with an absolutely, completely clear conscience. And that is, if you’re a frequent user, your only chance of passing a urine drug test is with plain old, simple dilution – AS LONG AS IT’S DONE CORRECTLY.
Even though I know for a fact that the only way to pass a urine test is with dilution, even I would never tell someone that they’re 100% guaranteed to pass with it. There are just too many variables involved – we all have different metabolisms, and I don’t have any control over how closely you would follow my instructions.
But I CAN promise you this: the step-by-step dilution method in “Under the Radar” is the closest you’re ever going to come to an iron-clad guarantee.
Hoping and Praying is NOT an Effective Method for Passing a Drug Test
If you’re only a light smoker then a so-called ‘detox’ drink might actually work for you under certain circumstances. Even
though they don’t actually detox anything, they DO work on the principle of dilution so they’re not totally worthless.
But for people who toke on a regular basis, detox drinks are a huge gamble – and one that you’ll probably lose…
“Under the Radar” takes all the guesswork out of how to prepare for your urine drug test. You’ll learn:
- exactly how to dilute and how to hide your dilution, down to the last detail.
- how to handle a wide variety of circumstances (because we all face different kinds of drug testing situations).
- exactly what goes on behind the scenes at the lab, both before and after you drop, so that you won’t be left hanging wondering what’s going on and whether it’s something you need to worry about or not.
If you’re feeling totally stressed out with worry over whether or not you’ll be able to pass a drug test, I guarantee you’ll feel MUCH BETTER after reading “Under the Radar“. You’ll understand exactly how drug tests work, you’ll realize that they can be beat, and you’ll have a solid, actionable plan for doing it.
Who Am I, and Why Should You Listen to Me?
There’s a ton of BS on the Internet about how to pass a drug test and you don’t know me from a bar of soap. So really, there’s no good reason why you should listen to me. The only thing I can tell you is that I’m a REAL person who has to take drug tests just like you do.
This is information I needed to learn for myself when I took my first drug test a few years back. It worked so well that friends wanted me to share my ‘recipe’ with them, and eventually things just kind of took on a life of their own…
I sincerely want to help you pass your drug test, which is why I have a totally open money-back guarantee. But at the end of the day, you’re going to have to decide for yourself whether or not you think I’m full of crap.
Capitalist Pig or Mother Theresa? You Decide.
Some people think I’m a schmuck because I don’t give my e-book away for free. Others, who have actually bought it and read it, think I’m practically a saint for writing something like this in the first place. You can’t please everyone.
The information in my ebook is basically the same as what you’ll find on my website, but in a very excruciatingly detailed step-by-step format that covers every situation you can think of. Because one thing I’ve learned FOR SURE about how to pass a drug test is that there isn’t an easy, one-size-fits-all solution that works exactly the same for everyone.
I spent countless hours doing the research for this e-book, not to mention the hours and hours I spent writing it. I continually do ongoing research to keep the information up to date, not to mention the time I spend answering emails every day. If I divided the hours I spend on this website by the amount of money I make from it on a monthly basis, I’m working for a hell of a lot less than minimum wage.
So if it bothers you that I actually charge a small price for this information, then you can bite me. But if you’re serious about passing your drug test, I’ll probably turn out to be the best friend you ever had. I sincerely believe this is the best information about passing drug tests that you’re going to find anywhere. Period.
My “No-Explanation-Needed” 1-Year Guarantee
If you read the information in my e-book and you think I’m full of it, just send me an email and I’ll give you a full refund anytime within the next 12 months – simple as that. You don’t even have to give a reason.
If you take my refund offer seriously, then you just might save yourself a lot of grief later on. You’ve literally got nothing to lose by just reading it, and a LOT to gain.
And, just FYI: any merchant who accepts credit cards (as I do) MUST honor their stated guarantee policy, or they risk losing the privilege of being able to take credit cards. My website has been online since March of 2007, and frankly I’m not about to risk throwing it all away by trying to scam someone out of a lousy 17 bucks!
PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ THESE TECHNICAL TIPS
1) You DO NOT need a PayPal account to buy the e-book. You can use a credit or debit card if you prefer. When you get to the PayPal checkout page, look for text that looks similar to this:
2) Don’t forget to check your SPAM folder. After ordering you’ll automatically be sent an email that contains your download link. Free email services like Yahoo and Hotmail are a little over-aggressive and will often send this type of email directly to a spam folder.
3) This is a digital e-book, which means it’s delivered to you online and you read it on your computer. You can print out the pages if you want, but you won’t receive anything by snail-mail.
4) The order process is AUTOMATED. Computer programs handle the whole thing, and computers do screw up every once in a while. If you run into a problem with receiving your e-book, don’t panic. Just use the Contact form here on my website, and send me an email explaining what the problem is. I’ll get back to you asap and get it straightened out.
That’s it for the fine print, but one more thing… How to pass a drug test is a personal decision that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Whatever you decide to do to try to pass your drug test, I sincerely wish you good luck, I really, truly do.
P.S. My NO QUESTIONS ASKED MONEY-BACK-GUARANTEE means you don’t have a thing to lose if you want to find out for yourself if this information is the Real Deal. I’ll let you read it, and you can be the judge.

This step by step woodworking project is about how to build a porch swing. Building a simple porch swing bench is a nice weekend project, that will bright up your porch and create a beautiful leisure area. There are so many designs and plans you could choose from, that we recommend you to take a look on the alternatives, before starting the actual construction of the bench.
When building the porch swing bench, you have two options. On one hand, you could hang the bench directly to the porch ceiling beams, while on the other hand, you could build a sturdy A-frame and hang the bench to it. Irrespective of your choice, we recommend you to check out the first part of the woodworking project HERE, as to learn how to make the A-frame for the porch swing.
Building the bench is not difficult, but there are still a few things that you should take into account, if you want to prevent costly mistakes and other issues. First of all, you should buy the best quality materials you could afford. Redwood, cedar or pine are great choices, as the bench will be exposed to moisture and sunlight. Always align the components at both ends and add glue to the joints, in order to get a rigid structure.
Building a porch swing
- A - 2 pieces of 2×3 lumber – 60″ long, 4 pieces – 17″ long FRAME
- B - 2 pieces of 2×3 lumber – 13 1/4″ long, 2 pieces – 11 1/2″ long SUPPORTS
- C - 2 pieces of 2×3 lumber – 23 1/2″ long ARM RESTS
- D - 7 pieces of 1×3 – 60″ long SLATS
- E - 2 pieces of 2×3 lumber – 22 1/2″ long, 1 piece – 60″ long, 1 piece of 2×6 – 55″ long FRAME
- F - 10 pieces of 1×3 lumber – 14″ long SLATS
-: How to build an a-frame swing
- Part 2: How to build a porch swing
How to build a porch swing
The first step of the woodworking project is to build the of the bench. As you can notice in the image, you need to use 2×3 lumber, several 2 1/2″ galvanized screws and waterproof glue. Drill pilot hole trough the frame and insert the screws, after checking if the corners are right-angled. Offset the studs placed on both ends by about 1 1/2″, otherwise you won’t be able to install the armrest supports.
Next, you need to attach the armrest supports on both ends of the frame. As you can see in the plane, we recommend you to cut the ends of the supports at about 7 degrees, as to give your bench a dynamic appearance. Drill pilot holes trough the supports and insert 2 1/2″ galvanized screws into the frame of the porch swing bench.
Building the backrest of the bench is not as complicated as it might seem at first glance. First of all, you need to assemble the frame of the backrest, by using 2×3 and 2×6 lumber (5″ wide). Cut both ends of the components at 45º, in order to get a professional result. Drill pilot holes, add waterproof glue and insert 2 1/2″ galvanized screws.
Next, you need to fit the slats between the top and bottom components and lock them into place with 1 1/4″ pocket hole screws. Use a good jig to drill two pocket holes at both ends of the slats. Make sure you place the slats equally spaced, by placing a wooden block between them.
In order to tilt the backrest and to create a rigid joint with the seat frame, we recommend you to pay attention to the instructions. Use a 2×4 slats between the backrest and the frame, making sure you cut it at 7º longitudinally. Align all the components at both ends, drill pilot holes, add waterproof glue and insert the 4″ galvanized screws into the frame, every 6″.
Attach 1×3 slats to the seat frame, leaving between them about 1/4″. It is essential to cut out small notches at both ends of the slats, otherwise they will not fit around the armrest supports. Pre-drill the lumber before inserting the 1 1/4″ screws into the seat frame.
Of of the last steps of the project is to build the armrests and to attach them to the supports. As you can see in the free plans, we recommend you to round the corners of the armrests and to smooth the edges with a router and a 1/4 bit. Cut the back of the armrest at 7º, as to fit into place properly. Drill pilot holes, countersink them, add glue and insert 2 1/2″ screws into the supports.
Use heavy-duty eye screws and rope when hanging the porch bench to the A-frame. Make sure you create rigid joints and you level everything with attention, if you want to prevent potential accidents in the future.
Last but not least, you should take care of the finishing touches..

FSP 3000 platform to play key role in demonstrating network capabilities at SC09
NORCROSS, Ga., and MARTINSRIED/MUNICH, Germany, Nov. 12 -- ADVA Optical Networking is helping the United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) push the bounds of modern networking capabilities with a unique demonstration at SC09, the 22nd annual Supercomputing Conference, taking place Nov. 14-20 in Portland, Ore.
NASA's High End Computing (HEC) program will use ADVA Optical Networking's FSP 3000 platform as a key component to extend its testbed of advanced hardware and software technologies to the show floor of SC09. This testbed is currently installed within NASA's Research and Development (R&D) network, linking the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) facility at Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., and the NASA Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) located at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
The testbed enables real-world testing of potential solutions for data access, movement and management throughout NASA's wide-area environment. Utilizing 40Gbit/s technologies, the testbed includes experimental wire-speed tests, traditional file transfer applications, emerging file transfer applications, file systems and more.
The HEC program delivers computing, storage and networking services to NASA's aeronautics, exploration, science and space missions. These geographically dispersed operations ingest and generate a vast amount of data, requiring NASA to remain vigilant in its efforts to obtain extremely fast, high-end networking services such as those enabled by ADVA Optical Networking's scalable Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology.
Demonstrations such as NASA's SC09 event could set the stage for the eventual development of a fully capable 40-100Gbit/s research network. With a collaborative networking environment, NASA scientists would be better equipped to store, share and analyze the massive volumes of data their work requires. One example to be highlighted at SC09 is the climate simulations work based at the NCCS, where scientists are collecting meteorological data from around the globe to develop highly accurate predictions about the Earth's climate. Assimilating satellite and remote sensory data from multiple locations, these scientists often spend large amounts of time managing remote copies of data and moving data throughout the wide area. But as the testbed yields advanced networking developments, these NASA experts could soon spend more time focusing on their mission and less time tackling the day-to-day tasks of data management.
"We're excited to be part of this significant NASA demonstration at SCO9," said Stephan Rettenberger, vice president of marketing for ADVA Optical Networking. "This is a unique opportunity to exhibit our own capabilities as NASA puts its testbed on display. The critical work conducted by NASA scientists is paving the way to our future. We're pleased that ADVA Optical Networking's high speed optical transmission technology is contributing to those important efforts."

Farmers from five states came together at the 2012 Sunflower Showcase Aug. 21 in Ulysses, Kan. Hosted by Kansas State University and the High Plains National Sunflower Association, the event offered producers the opportunity to tour fields in the Ulysses area and swap information on the successful production and management of the crop.
The morning plot tours, led by Ron Meyer of Colorado State University and Calvin Trostle of Texas A&M University, took the group around to several sunflower fields in a couple of southwestern Kansas counties.
At an irrigated field south of Ulysses, the tour saw an example of the 678 Triumph short stature sunflower hybrid. Short stature hybrids tolerate windy conditions better, which is handy for the High Plains.
Grant County Ag and Natural Resources Extension Agent Joe Leibbrandt explained the farmer prefers a sunflower-wheat rotation because both crops handle stress better, especially on an irrigation well that's pumping 600 gallons per minute.
Trostle showed the visitors an example of a sunflower head moth and emphasized growers must eradicate this yield-stealing pest.
"I say the sunflower head moth is the boll weevil of sunflowers," Trostle said. "They're different, of course, but we must eradicate them like we did with the boll weevil in cotton country." The time to spray for head moths is when they're seen in the field.
"The threshold for spraying is traditionally if you see one to two moths for every five heads," Trostle said. However, if a farmer sees them flying in the evenings when he checks fields, it's a sign that he should spray, and Texas AgriLife Extension researchers in Amarillo have re-worded their guidelines to reflect that, Trostle explained.
However, producers must plan ahead for their spraying needs, and that means talking to their crop dusting pilots to have the right chemicals on hand when they're needed, Trostle added. And be sure that your pilot is applying the right chemical at the right rate with the plane, Trostle said.
In this particular field the tour saw some unevenness, likely the result of two rows of a planter calibrated at a different depth than the others. Meyer said seeding depth and the presence of moisture at planting are all important for emergence. "The ideal seeding rate is two inches, and this was seeded at 2.5 inches because of drought," he said. "Research has shown that seeding at 4 inches reduces stands by 30 percent. So, if you have to plant into dry conditions, bump up that seeding rate by 20 percent." Even better is to pre-irrigate the field before planting, which prevents crusting in the field that can affect emergence, he added. And, smaller seeds, whether they're oilseeds or confectionary, always get better stands because it takes less moisture to start the germination process.
In another field, farther south, the tour saw sunflowers planted in wheat stubble. Leibbrandt said this farmer uses sunflowers not so much for yields as it is to improve his soils. "He makes at least 1,500 pounds, but he's not pre-watering here," he said. Instead, the field got about .80 inches right at planting in rainfall, and once the flowers get to a decent stage of growth, he'll water the field.
Sunflower's water efficiency is well known among producers and researchers, and in this time of lowering aquifer levels up and down the High Plains that is beneficial, Meyer and Trostle explained.
"We can find roots at up to six feet deep, sunflowers will pick up moisture and fertilizer other crops can't get to," Meyer said. "Flowers take seven inches of moisture to get to seed production, compared to wheat that has to have five inches to get to production." At 400 gallons per minute on poorer wells, there's trouble for corn if it doesn't rain. "Farmers can take half of a field, and concentrate their irrigation there," he added.
Fortunately for today's farmers, we now have equipment that allows us to better no-till plant sunflowers into wheat stubble, Meyer added. "We can till less, save that water and wind erosion, and capture snow in winter," he said. "And, that's money in the bank to you guys."
After lunch, John Sandbakken, executive director of the National Sunflower Association, updated producers on the state of the industry. With a rising trend in eliminating trans fats in diets, sunflower oil is rising in popularity. Sunflower oil has stability and shelf life of other products, but also has an acceptable flavor to the palette, Sandbakken said. NSA President Tom Young, Onida, S.D., followed with an update on the association's activities on behalf of producers.

Drought Deepens In Hardest Hit Parts Of U.S.
:
-- 4.21 percent of the contiguous U.S. was experiencing exceptional drought conditions, up from 3.01 percent the week before. The states suffering through such conditions include Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana and Georgia.
-- 24.14 percent was experiencing extreme or exceptional drought conditions, up from 22.27 percent. The affected states include those where the drought is exceptional and others such as Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Tennessee and Kentucky.
-- 46.01 percent was experiencing severe, extreme or exceptional drought conditions, up from 45.57 percent.
Our colleagues Matt Stiles, Chris Amico and Danny Debelius have taken the drought mitigation center's data for this year and put together an interactive graphic that maps how the drought has grown this year.
The only bit of modest good news in the latest report: altogether, 78.14 percent of the lower 48 was suffering through something ranging from "abnormally dry" conditions to an exceptional drought. That was down from 79.38 percent the previous week.
And looking ahead, the drought experts have some hopeful news: There's a good chance of rain the next few days over much of the "Midwest, Northeast, Great Lakes, Gulf Coast and Atlantic coastal reaches of the Carolinas and Georgia."
Still, as The Associated Press reports, "the Plains states where the production of corn and soybeans is key are being hit harder by excessive drought conditions in the wake of the hottest month on record in the continental U.S., contributing to a surge in global food prices." That has some farmers turning to drought-resistant sorghum, CBS News says.:

Concerns About Ill-Treatment in Military Court Hearings for 14
(Washington, DC) - A prominent rights activist who was active in Bahrain's pro-democracy street protests appeared before a special military court on May 8, 2011, bearing visible signs of ill-treatment and perhaps torture, Human Rights Watch said today.
The activist, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, was one of 14 defendants, most active with opposition political movements, charged with attempting to "topple the regime forcibly in collaboration with a terrorist organization working for a foreign country." His wife and daughter spoke with him briefly after the court session, the first time they had been allowed to see him since he was arrested and badly beaten on April 9. They observed multiple facial injuries, and he told them he had four fractures on the left side of his face, including one in his jaw that had required four hours of corrective surgery.
."
Human Rights Watch has documented the routine use of torture by Bahraini security officials during similar interrogations in political and security-related cases.
The National Safety Lower Court postponed resuming the trial until May 12 to allow defense lawyers to meet with their clients, and in some cases to appoint their own lawyers. The case was brought by the military prosecutor, and a military judge presides over the sessions. Bahrain's police and military have operated under martial law, termed a "state of national safety," since March 15.
The 13 defendants who appeared before the special court with al-Khawaja are Abd al-Wahab Hussain, Ebrahim Sharif, Hassan Mushaima, Abd al-Jalil al-Singace, Mohammed Habib al-Saffaf (al-Moqdad), Saeed Mirza Ahmed, Abd al-Jalil al-Moqdad, Abd a-Hadi Abdullah Mahdi Hassan, Al-Hurr Yusif Mohammed, Abdullah Isa al-Mahroos, Salah al-Khawaja, Mohammed Hassan Jawad, and Mohammed Ali Ismael.
Seven others being tried in abstentia in the same case are Akeel Ahmad al-Mafudh, Ali Hassan Abdullah, Abd al-Ghani al-Khanjar, Saeed Abd al-Nabi Shihab, Abd al-Rauf al-Shayeb, Abbas al-Umran, and Ali Hassan Mushaima. Several are in hiding, presumably in Bahrain, while others have been living abroad.
Prior to the May 8 court session, Bahrain's military public prosecutor, Col. Yusif Rashid Feleyfel, had formed an investigative committee composed of several public prosecutors who questioned the 14 suspects, the state-run Bahrain News Agency (BNA) announced.
Prosecutors have accused the defendants of a variety of national security crimes under Bahrain's 1976 Penal Code and the 2006 Counterterrorism Law. These alleged crimes include "organizing and managing a terrorist group for the overthrow and the change of the country's constitution and the royal rule," "seeking and correspond[ing] with a terrorist organization abroad working for a foreign country to conduct heinous acts" against Bahrain, funding a foreign terrorist organization, insulting the army, "broadcasting false news and rumors" that threatened public security, inciting sectarianism, and organizing and participating in rallies without having obtained the necessary permits.
"Some of these charges, like insulting the army, should not be crimes at all, and it looks like at least in Abdulhadi-al-Khawaja's case the authorities have tried to beat a confession out of him rather than come up with evidence to support these charges," Stork said.
According to information provided to Human Rights Watch, the 14 detainees appeared in court dressed in loose grey prison garb that covered their arms and legs. Most were unshaven and several had lost considerable weight - in the case of National Democratic Action Society leader Ebrahim Sharif, approximately 15 kilograms, according to a tweet posted by his family. Human Rights Watch earlier received unconfirmed reports that authorities had hospitalized Sharif, who has a history of heart problems, prior to the court session.
Other detainees, including Hassan Mushaima of the Al-Haq movement and Abd al-Wahab Hussein of the Wa'fa Society, had noticeable limps. Sources told Human Rights Watch that when the defendants asked to speak about the abuse they allegedly experienced in detention, security forces forcibly removed them from court.
According to several accounts provided to Human Rights Watch, several detainees did not have families present at the May 8 court hearing because the families had not been informed of the session. Government officials claimed that appropriate notice regarding the trial had been given in local newspapers. Human Rights Watch learned from another source that Sharif was unaware of the charges that had been brought against him until he appeared in court.
Maryam al-Khawaja, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja's daughter, told Human Rights Watch on May 9 that her mother, Khadija al-Mousawi, and sister, Zainab al-Khawaja, met with him for about 10 minutes after the initial hearing. Al-Khawaja told his wife and daughter about the facial fractures. They also said they observed stitches above his left eye, and that he had difficulty eating and smiling because of his serious facial injuries, Maryam al-Khawaja told Human Rights Watch.
She said her father had gone on a hunger strike to protest his ill-treatment and his lack of access to a lawyer. She also said that he told his wife and daughter that he had been tortured, but could not describe details because the family meetings took place in the presence of security guards.
Human Rights Watch had previously received credible reports that al-Khawaja had been admitted to Bahrain Defense Force hospital for six days for treatment of injuries, including to his jaw and head. One person who claimed to have seen him said he was at that point unrecognizable as a result of apparent beatings in detention.
On May 8 authorities rejected claims that any detainees had been tortured. BNA reported that government sources maintained that information "received from the Military Hospital and the Salmaniya Medical Complex, the largest hospitals in the country, [show] that neither hospital has admitted or treated any of the detainees." The news agency said that "rumors about the admissions and hospitalization were untrue and were fabricated, politically-motivated news."
Human Rights Watch expressed serious concern about al-Khawaja's condition and those of others at risk of torture or ill-treatment in light of recent documented cases of individuals who died in custody under suspicious circumstances. One of four such cases documented by Human Rights Watch in April was that of Ali Isa Ibrahim Saqer, 34, whose body showed signs of severe physical abuse when Human Rights Watch viewed his remains.
Bahrain is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which prohibits "torture or... cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." The prohibition on torture is absolute and non-derogable, which means that authorities may not torture even in circumstances of national emergency. Bahrain has also ratified the Convention against Torture, which prohibits torture and other ill-treatment under all circumstances, prohibits the use of statements made as a result of torture as evidence in legal proceedings, and requires the prosecution of those responsible for torture.
Human Rights Watch called on Bahrain to suspend further prosecution of civilians in special military courts, allow them full access to lawyers, family members, and necessary medical care, and set up an impartial commission to look into serious allegations of torture. Human Rights Watch opposes the creation and use of special courts or the use of military courts to try national security crimes.
Human Rights Watch also repeated its call for the United Nations Human Rights Council to address the violent suppression of protests and subsequent arbitrary detentions and torture or ill-treatment in custody of detainees in Bahrain by convening a "thematic" special session on civil protests in the region.
"Ordinary courts are perfectly capable of effectively prosecuting serious crimes, including terrorist offenses," Stork said. "Apparently Bahrain is not interested in justice but in punishing those involved in anti-government street protests."

HUDSON COUNTY -- All of high school sports have been suspended until the state is restored to power.
The NJSIAA soccer playoffs have been delayed until Thursday, but some of the early round games were played before the storm hit.
The football schedule was postponed one week, so the games that were scheduled for Nov. 2 & 3 have been pushed to Nov.9 &10, with the first round of the state playoffs set to begin Nov. 16 & 17.
The cross country state sectionals were also put off for one week, from Nov. 3 to Nov.10. However, they are surveying the tree damage in both Garret Mountain in Woodland Park and Warinanco Park in Elizabeth. If the damage is bad, then there has to be alternative sites, more than likely Thompson Park in Jamesburg or Holmdel Park in Holmdel, but the NJSIAA doesn't want to use Holmdel for three straight weeks. - Jim Hague

A mass slaughter of World of Warcraft players has devastated the popular online roleplaying game.
Hackers were somehow able to gain control of the game and kill characters at will.
Normally players of WoW are unable to kill each other unless they each agree to a duel, but the hackers worked out how to override those protections.
The slaughter saw entire cities wiped out across Azeroth - the world of, well, Warcraft. The populations of Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Tarren Mill, Ragnaros, Draenor and Twisting Nether were put to the hackers' sword.
In an echo of the South Park episode 'Make Love, Not Warcraft', it appears as though the hackers were able to rampage unhindered for hours.
But the details of the hack are still unclear.
"We don't know exactly what they did, but somehow they were able to kill every single player's character in that city and every single computer controlled character - and they were doing this repeatedly," said Olivia Grace, of Joystiq and WoW Insider, to the BBC.
The game's makers Blizzard Activision said that the hack had been fixed - and they were leading a "thorough investigation":.
One hacker - named Jadd - has already claimed responsibility.
Writing on the Ownedcore Forums, he said that he thought it was "funny".

Kurds in Turkey Rended by War That Haunts Country - NYTimes.com
Do you really think that one day even if the Kurds have their freedom that they will support Israel? It was a Kurd called Saladin who conquered Jeruzalem from the Crusaders and it will be again a Kurd who conquer it this time from the zionists.
We have been staunch allies to Israel and have asked little in return yet when we do ask for them to ease tensions with their neighboring Arab neighbors they refuse to cooperate and we back off. We never deny them the billions we give them. They have become extremely wealthy in all areas of commerce in America and their lobbyists are the strongest dealing with politicians.
I am neither pro nor con Palestine. I look beyond terroism toward the people who struggle daily to exist in a war torn area. Women, children, seniors and men who have never picked up a gun or aided or abetted a terrorist. The Kurds also deserve a homeland after years of tyranny.
It is not up to Israel whether or not Palestine becomes an indepenent state. Instead of fighting over a parcel of land, the boundaries will be set and I believe, if Israel complies, much of the violence will level off.
That massacre took place nearly one hundred years ago. Using it as a predictor of Turkey's actions in future is as unhelpful and misdirecting as looking at British behavior in India over the same period, where a great many native people were deliberately starved, as a predictor of its reaction to future events.
A great many people have died under the auspices of the 'western rule book' all over the world, a hundred years ago, seventy years ago, eight years ago-- and no rules were broken. Perhaps we ought to retire the conceit.

L chance to redeem herself.
The "Video Games" singer is set to make her "Idol" debut on Thursday, March 15.
Although her appearance on the reality singing competition has not been confirmed, Spinner reports that tickets to the taping of "American Idol" this coming Thursday depict Del Rey alongside the two scheduled performers -- Disney starlet Demi Lovato and former "American Idol" contestant Daughtry.
It has yet to be revealed whether the young artist will sing live or whether it's a pre-taped performance.
Fans of Del Rey have even more to look forward to this week after the singer recently tweeted the cover art for her new single "Blue Jeans," the third off her debut album "Born to Die."
Blue Jeans cover art, video coming soon twitter.com/LanaDelRey/sta…— Lana Del Rey (@LanaDelRey) March 13, 2012
Though earlier reports suggested Del Rey was canceling her North American tour after her poor "Saturday Night Live" showing, her management claimed such a tour was never planned. They plan to launch a proper North American tour for Del Rey in October.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg is absolutely right to call upon President Barack Obama and his opponent Mitt Romney to do more than sympathize with the families and friends of the 12 people who were shot and killed by a clearly crazed shooter in Aurora, Colorado last week. More than 50, an estimated 40 percent of guns sold in the Unite States.
President Obama is being unfairly hectored by Mitt Romney and by much of the media for rejecting the idea that government is evil. The president defended the role of government, the thought isn't as well-articulated as it could have been, isn't it true? Without the government building infrastructure -- the roads, bridges and tunnels -- without the government providing security -- police and army -- to keep us safe, without the government providing other basic services such as public education, hospitals, etc., could anything of consequence for a great society be accomplished? Aren't we proud of the fact that each generation builds on the successes of the prior generation? The president was not diminishing the individual successes of citizens. He was pointing out what we all know to be true -- that even the most successful and brilliant among us have had help along the way. The help of other individuals including teachers who taught and inspired them, friends who helped and comforted them, cops and firefighters who protected them. Government, if it does its job, provides that which an individual cannot provide alone in building our civilization and society.
Our election process is disintegrating with these petty attacks being engaged in by both Democrats and Republicans and they should stop. This election should be fought on the basis of what each candidate offers on the important issues confronting us, e.g., jobs, the solvency of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, improving education, providing medical care for all of our citizens, reducing the nation's deficit, providing for an annual federal balanced budget, dealing with foreign affairs, preventing wars and acts of terrorism, and a host of other key issues. Both candidates have to address these issues and tell us how they would handle them if they were to win.

Isn't it outrageous that the adult leaders of Boy Scouts of America recently reaffirmed their policy of discriminating against children whose sexual orientation is homosexual, as well as employees, including Scoutmasters, whose sexual orientation is homosexual? Shouldn't decisions on being able to serve in the Boy Scouts as a Scout, Scoutmaster or employee be made on the basis of the conduct of the individual? Girl Scouts, I believe, have no such ban. If a Boy Scout or Scoutmaster engages in inappropriate conduct in carrying out his duties to the organization, including sexual conduct, kick him out. Whether the sexual conduct is heterosexual or homosexual is immaterial.
We no longer have a drafted army where the young men of this country can learn to live cooperatively with one another and respect one another. The next best place to do that is in the volunteer Scout movement, which attracts millions of young people. If the Boy Scouts officials say to their young charges, by excluding boys who are gay, they are to be avoided and condemned because of their sexual orientation, they are contributing to the problem of bullying against homosexual youths. If the Boy Scout leaders refuse to change their policy, every city and state where Boy Scouts are provided any special privileges by government should immediately end them.
How wonderful it would be if fair and like-minded people supporting the Scout movement created an alternative to the existing bigoted organization.

It is that time of year when academic pursuits are put on hold for one day as culinary competitions sweep through the academy in celebration of the International Edible Book Festival. Forget about the stress of preparing your tenure dossier or finishing your research before spring break. Now is the time let your creative juices flow!
Hundreds of libraries across the world unite in this tasty event that has gained popularity and momentum since 1999 when book artist/librarian Judith Hoffberg and friend Béatrice Coron came up with the idea to showcase the work of artists in edible format. Since its modest beginnings in 1999 this event has morphed into an international phenomenon that celebrates books, reading, cooking and well, the creative conjoining of all three. Who doesn't want to take a break from the anxiety of the job search, the worry over student loans, the concern about retention, recruitment, class size and funding? What's even better -- you really don't even have to cook!
At the University of Cincinnati the event is strictly for fun and gastronomical pleasure. Past literary masterpieces include: The Oreo of the Species, Cold Mountain and The Secret Life of Bees.
But this year's edible book festival at the University of Puget Sound is not just a piece of cake. Here library staff are working with campus partners focused on social justice to conduct a food drive for a local pantry, and also working with the campus chapter of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity for Women -- a group dedicated to philanthropic and community service efforts that will remove the barrier of illiteracy. Pi Beta Phi also partners with the Literacy Foundation, an international non-profit organization whose mission includes providing children from low-income families the opportunity to read and own their first books.
Some edible favorites include:
Frank in Stein (This is for the non-cook and requires limited preparation) and In Cold Blood (What could be better than partially frozen V8 juice?).

The "Boardwalk Empire" Season 3 finale built on that momentum with another stellar episode that gave "Boardwalk" fans the bloodbath they've been waiting for and brilliantly tied up nearly every loose end the show raised this season.
This may be the best episode in the "Boardwalk Empire's" history, a suspenseful, action-packed and brilliantly executed hour of TV that could compete with the strongest offerings of "Homeland," "Breaking Bad" and "Mad Men."
Oh no, Owen Sleater. Last week we wondered what terrible fate Nucky's driver and Margaret's Irish lover on the side would meet for conspiring to run off with his boss' wife, and this episode delivered that brutal answer.
"The Milkmaid's Lot" picked up after the massive explosion blew up Babette's, and as crews cleaned up the wreckage on the Boardwalk, Nucky was recovering from a concussion he experienced in the blast.
And boom goes the dynamite. This season of "Boardwalk Empire" has at times felt like watching a slow-burning fuse, and in "The Pony," it finally exploded.
We're all hoping that "Boardwalk Empire's" third season is building up to a climactic and hopefully awesome war between Nucky Thompson and Gyp Rosetti, but it's sure taking its sweet time to get there.
After last week's action-packed episode of "Boardwalk Empire," this week was a slow, ponderous episode that pivoted away from Nucky Thompson's looming war with Gyp Rosetti to focus on Nucky's marital and political problems.
It's time for us to revel in the violent and sexual craziness that serve as "Boardwalk Empire's" climactic exclamation points. This episode was all about strangulation and misdirection, and featured three genuine "Holy shit!!" moments.
Is Nucky Thompson slipping? The latest episode of "Boardwalk Empire" climaxed with a violent ambush from Gyp Rosetti that represented the culmination of months of bad decision-making from Atlantic City's bootlegger-in-chief.
Fans of New York City's rich past have seen three of its most tumultuous decades represented in television series this year. And each show is bringing a different approach to filling out the historical contours of this ever-changing metropolis.
Nucky Thompson tried to avert war and make Gyp Rosetti a peace offering in this episode, but "Boardwalk Empire's" chief Season 3 antagonist is not a reasonable man -- he doused the Sheriff of Tabor Heights with gasoline and lit him on fire.
In the last four weeks we've had an avalanche of TV releases, including some of the best shows on television.

As the legislative drive to achieve comprehensive immigration reform gets underway in the Senate, some critics of the effort worry that legalization will flood the job market with low-skilled immigrants, dragging down the U.S. economy.
We need to hold the Senate to its courageous promise. More U-visas for the criminally abused will mean more liberty, equality, and freedom from injustice for all.
Conservatives are being forced to take sides: They can either stand with promoters of inflammatory tracts -- like the Heritage Foundation and their hack Jason Richwine -- or they can stand with Americans in both parties who are working to fix our broken immigration system.
Mexico is already ahead of us in developing the border-zone infrastructure needed for bi-national trade and prosperity. Why aren't we matching these efforts?
Any contract that has at its essence an invalid clause is in and of itself invalid. So to me, every marriage is invalid as long as two adults are barred from marriage. It is an immoral clause, and a moral cause.
Immigrants contribute to, not take, from our economy. Economic data conclusively shows that immigrants boost our nation fiscally and add to our labor force.
As someone who immigrated to Hawaii from Japan as a young child, I know firsthand the determination it takes to thrive in a new school, a new language, and a new country. I was able to succeed because of all the opportunities I had.
Immigration has always involved hardship, but unfortunately I never fully came to grips with that reality until it became part of my own reality. Ours was supposed to be an open-and-shut case: a fiancée visa. Our timing, however, was admittedly unhelpful: right after 9/11.
Fwd.us' lobbying approach reflects the worst of DC-style politics: it's cynical, it's transactional, and it's predicated on using critically important social and ecological issues as pawns in a chess game. Worse for Mark Zuckerberg, it's ineffective.

What words, what story can I offer to refute the losses and, in the same moment, celebrate the indomitable spirits of people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS?
Only the story I really know. My own. My brother, Patrick, died of complications of HIV in 1988 in Abilene, Texas, one of the top three most conservative cities in America (LA Times). There was no real treatment then, just AZT. There was no real protection under the law to defend his health insurance or to provide disability payments. His employer fired him. He lost all of his assets and our family brought him home to die. We were blessed by the care of an extraordinary physician, Dr. Hirsch and his team of nurses at Hendricks Hospital. They treated Patrick with great respect and did their best, but in those days, most people with AIDS did not last long. Patrick died in less than a year.
His move back home was a catalytic event in our family made even more combustable by the fact that we desperately tried to keep Patrick's entire life in a dark closet of our own making. My mother and father wrestled with their fundamentalist and evangelical beliefs that seemed to condemn him even while they could not. My mother never fully reconciled the depth of her love for him and her understanding of the good person he was with what the Church said about him. Sadly, our attempts to hide his diagnosis meant that we also hid him and ourselves, cutting ourselves off from support that we all needed. In many ways, Patrick became a prisoner in chains that we fashioned out of fear.
Soon after he died, breast cancer killed my mother. I continue to believe that her unresolved grief really killed her and cancer was just the vehicle. Soon after she died, her mother died. In the South we sometimes say, "she gave up the ghost" and I think the expression fits in this case. She gave up the ghost that haunted us all -- the specter of our own internalized homophobia and AIDS phobia. My grandmother didn't know how to cope with her feelings of loss and the deeply held beliefs about sexuality that had been engrained in her. So, she exited as well. Her attending physician said complications of pneumonia killed her. I think she just could not breathe the air anymore. It was too thick with the cloud of shame and blame dispensed by our religious authorities and swallowed by us without question.
During the time that our family was struggling with the domino effect of these our losses, my children were watching. My son knew he was gay. And, being a really smart kid, he realized that there was no healthy place for him to reside with us. So, he exited as well.
Quit school. Moved out of Abilene. Joined the National Coming Out Day office as a volunteer (then in Santa Fe, New Mexico), learned how to live with integrity about his sexuality, went to college and got a job. He had some really rocky times, yet he held tight to the boundary that he set about the crazy-making religious orientation of our family.
He insisted that we really look at what the Bible says about homosexuality and not just blindly accept what our church said was true. Eventually he finished his Masters in Divinity at Episcopal Divinity School and wrote a book entitled "Uncommon Hope" and has founded a church by the same name in San Francisco. Perhaps you have guessed that his ministry is all about helping people in churches and communities eliminate stigma that separates us from one another.
Over time, all of our family has evolved in our understanding of what AIDS is and is not. And, thankfully, we evolved in our understanding of love and grace. Things are a bit smoother for all of us now.
We had to find ways to be spiritually healthy. I like to think that we were, in no small part, inspired by the courage of my brother. The part of the story that I did not reveal early in this posting was that my brother was outrageously honest about who he was and his sexual orientation. When we tried our best to push him into the closet, he kicked it open and came out tap dancing. He never made excuses to any of us for being gay, in fact, he told us that we needed to stop making excuses because he had known he was gay since he was five. He also believed that God made him that way and, perhaps even more important, he believed that even if God did not make him gay, God loved him and chose him beyond any choices, predispositions or behaviors.
He had this really queer and wonderful theology that informs us all even now -- he understood that what animates each of us is both unique to each of us and absolutely the same -- a spiritual DNA that cannot be destroyed by us no matter how hard we try, a gift of life that resides beyond our cellular configurations and beyond labels and stigma -- the ones we put on ourselves and the ones others put on us.
Patrick imparted a gift to all of us by refusing to give up the gift he knew had been given to him by a Greater Power than any of us can grasp. On World AIDS Day 2011, I want to honor him and thank him for being everything he was -- proud, living out loud and full of grace. It is because of him that the rest of us have a chance to get it right.

John Polly: World AIDS Day, 9/11 and Miss Fire Island
World AIDS Day - December 1, 2011
World AIDS Day - Time and Date
I'm remember Falwell interviewed in 1983, smugly claiming that AIDS was god's judgment. This was in San Francisco channel. Outraged. I called and wrote the station. "This is not a moral matter, this is a medical matter. This man knows absolutely nothing about either. Why is he here?"
These days, only Fundelibangelistas parrot nonsense about AIDS being god's punishment. The less unhinged call it God's judgment for sexual immorality. Normal, decent people understand it is a disease. There are no rewards or punishments, only consequences. Reality has informed their compassion. Religion moved from ignorance to grace-- mostly.
Let's look at a bigger picture. There has been a 1700 year jihad by religion against our right to exist and live our lives as full members of society. All based upon some badly mistranslated and misapplied passages that have give a very thin veneer of respectability to otherwise hugely damaging, vicious, wholly unwarranted prejudice.
One need only read the comments here to see how ignorance, stupidty, hate, fear, moral myopia, and wholly imaginary superiority are displayed as honorable in God's name. These antigays will even tell us they love us.
A great many believers and their churches have moved in the direction from religious ignorance to grace. My questions are:
1) when will the rest of the churches admit to their ignorance and move to grace?
2) when those that have done so already start insisting that the others do NOT represent Christianity?
Story: in her 20s my best friend for a time worked in an industry full of gay men, she really enjoyed their company and saw them as no different to any other person. Fast forward 15 years and she's become a born again Christian and has become terribly homophobic with her circle of friends shrunk to only those 'who share her faith'. We remain good friends because we shared so much of our youth together and have that firm foundation for our friendship but it's sad to see how her religion has made her LESS tolerant and always fearful and suspicious because she's had it drilled into her that the 'devil comes in very seductive guises'.
Rather than helping to find a solution for the unchecked spread of AIDS world wide, the RCC turned a blind eye to the problem, and in fact, made it much worse with their out-dated, hate-filled, fear-mongering dogma.
The church falls down on its obligation to help save lives, because they act like you can't talk about certain things. Why not encourage breast cancer screenings in the churchs' women's group, prostate and men's issues with the mens group, healthy eating options (food is the only thing the church doesn't scream is a burn in hell sin, does anyone see the correlation between that and obesity??), and why not anonymous testing held right there at the church by an outside group?? You have a captive audience, that listens to the person in the pulpit, seems to me that that peron has a bigger moral obligation to protect people he/she sees every week as opposed to filling their heads with hateful vitriol that won't get any of them into their heavens.
I wouldn't call your brother's theology queer, it's a central theme in almost all religions if a person can get past the dogma. What is an oddity is the interpretation of Christ's message by fundamentalist bigots, it's difficult to comprehend the irrational fear and hate.
"Deny yourself, pick up your cross, and follow ME"
"Do what ever you want, just put 10% onto the collection plate.
Are you Flesh of the Carnal world OR are you Spirit that has no sex, sexual relationsips, wants or desires, emotions, sense pleasure. Groups and Chruches do not take you there. Take yourself.
Pickup your cross just don't ask me to carry it for you.
I think it's quite possible for our actions to be guided by spirit as we embrace the 'carnal' world with all of its beauty and ugliness. It's preferable to an attempt to transcend it completely in my view, an unattainable goal and perhaps pointless in this incarnation, 20 years of meditation brought me to this conclusion. We will detach down the road, there's really no choice.
Simon of Cyrene, you're not.

I'm calling BULLSPIT on this nonsense.
We've already gathered enough scientific evidence to know what this blogger relates anecdotally: gender attraction typically manifests way before puberty - often as young as 4 or 5 - as it did with the blogger's late brother.
Only someone who has their head planted firmly in the sand would be in denial of what science has discoverd by observation: Homosexuality ls no more perverse and no more of a moral issue than being left-handed. Sociological studies show that it is a constant 5-10% in various populations across time and space. It's just part of the normal human condition - like being a ginger.
Of course, it wasn't all that long ago that ignorant christians thought that being left-handed or being a ginger or having a skin discoloration was some sort of mark of moral turpitude. Idiot dependence on their flawed and ancient text tends to knock off quite a few IQ points.
The statement that your brother "understood that what animates each of us is both unique to each of us and absolutely the same" resonates in my UU heart.

FORT TOWSON — The Fort Towson Tigers received a wonderful sendoff Wednesday as they headed to the state playoffs for the first time in 37 years.The day began with a downright giddy dancing performance by Drake King as he carried his bags onto the bus. Once the entire student body arrived, the Tigers’ cheerleaders started the pep-rally with a cheer.Then it was time for the basketball team to get loud. Seniors Zack Samaha and Phillip Clark chanted with the crowd. As Samaha yelled out “black,” the entire student body surrounding him, and holding black and gold ballons, would yell back, “gold” representative of their school colors. Clark would get everyone riled up and then it was Samaha’s turn again. Next, the cheerleaders got involved in some back and forth chants with the crowd.After the chants were over, Superintendent Gary Parris invited the crowd to all gather around the boys team as they stood around the base of the flagpole. As hundreds of students surrounded the boys, Parris joyously commanded everyone to release the balloons and the sky turned into a momentary view of black and gold.The players scurried onto the bus, opened the windows and leaned out as students and parents took turns high-fiving them.

A brief overview of the services hosted centrally by CUNY for all colleges, accessible via the CUNY Portal.
CUNY hosts a number of services centrally, so that they can be consistent across all the colleges that are part of the CUNY system. All of these services are accessed using your CUNY Portal ID (rather than your Hunter NetID), and you log into all of them via the CUNY Portal.
The Portal services include:
Blackboard is a course management system that many professors at Hunter use. Some of the most commonly-used features include posting of announcements, assignments, and tests; discussion boards; uploading files for students to download; and the grade book.
To take a course at another CUNY campus, you need to file an ePermit, which then must be approved by the Registrars of Hunter College and of the college you wish to take the class at. (All of the approvals take place online.) You can learn more about the requirements to qualify for ePermit here.
DegreeAudit, also called DIG (Degree Information for Graduation), is an application that checks what courses you've already taken, and then calculates what courses you still need to complete your degree.
In order to quickly and efficiently communicate with students in emergency situations, the CUNY Alert system allows members of the CUNY community to request notifications relevant to them via email, SMS, or automated phone call. Everyone at Hunter is strongly encouraged to sign up for this service.
Many vendors provide educational discounts to college students. At the CUNY eMall, you can browse discounts available to CUNY students by category (software, hardware, phone service, etc.). You can also download free anti-virus software from the eMall--something that everyone in the Hunter community is strongly advised to do!

Marshall Grinds out 70-67 Win over Morehead State
The Thundering Herd (4-3) defeated the Eagles (4-3) for the 12th time over the last 14 meetings and the 11th consecutive time at home. The longtime series of the two schools, just a short distance away along I-64, now favors the Herd, 50-44.
Tinnon made 5-of-10 attempts from the field and two free throws to score 12 points. He also added season-high 16 rebounds, including six on the offensive end. As a team, Marshall outrebounded MSU 53-46. It was the most rebounds for the Herd since recording 55 three seasons ago against VMI (12/19/10).
“It’s a really good win,” said head coach Tom Herrion. “I’m thrilled with this win. I love grinders. Those are the types of games you get a lot better in.”
The rebounding total, especially the 24 offensive boards, helped Marshall overcome shooting 33.3 percent from the field. MSU did not fare much better shooting 36.6 percent.
“We had good looks we didn’t knock down in the first half,” Herrion said, whose team was 9-of-34 in the first half. “But I’m proud of the way we hung our hat tonight on defense. I really feel good about tonight, walking out later on tonight out of my office, that you can win when you defend and rebound.”
It took some time for the Herd to find its shooting stroke as it made just three of its first 21 attempts from the field. Marshall trailed for the most of the first half and faced its largest deficit of seven (21-14) after a layup by Chad Posthumus at the 6:21 mark.
However, Marshall scored the next 10 points of the game and held a 24-21 lead before heading into halftime ahead 24-23.
Marshall never trailed in the second half, but never comfortably pulled away either, leading anywhere from two to eight points.
What hurt Marshall throughout the game, ended up benefitting the team in the end, free throw shooting. The Herd made 28-of-44 attempts (63.6 percent), including 12-of-13 by junior guard D.D. Scarver, who drained 10-of-10 in the final 1:17 of the game as the Eagles fouled to retain possession.
“I knew he would make them,” Herrion said of Scarver. “You execute, get the ball into the guy you think is hot in that situation. We know they are going to trap or foul most likely.”
Scarver finished with a game-high 17 points. He was joined in double-figures by Nigel Spikes and DeAndre Kane. Spikes finished with 13 points on 4-of-6 shooting from the field and nine rebounds. Kane had 13 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.
Morehead State was led by Jarrett Stokes who finished with 14 points and five rebounds. Milton Chavis, who entered the game as the Eagles’ leading scorer, had 11 points, but was just 4-of-14 from the field.
Marshall will next be in action on Saturday when it hosts UNC Wilmington at 7 p.m.

Truth be told, I am probably writing this as much for my benefit as yours, because my mind is filled with a hodgepodge of thoughts and feelings flittering around like fireflies on a warm summer evening. Maybe writing some of them down will clarify them in my own mind, too.
When I do get to finally hold you in my arms, this little blue marble that we share with 7 billion other people will have once more started its annual tour around the sun, just as it has for the past 4 billion years or so. You'll be just on the edge of this magical, mysterious journey that we call life. As I've made this annual trek 70 times already, I'd like to reflect on a couple of things that might eventually make sense to you.
How might I describe life on this blue planet right now? Charles Dickens, a writer you'll meet in a few years, described it was describing a world two centuries ago, a world filled with wars, revolutions, natural disasters, stupendous discoveries and breathtaking achievements in art and music. Thinkers referred to it as "The Age of Reason," although at times there seemed to be little evidence of reason.
In some ways, not much has changed since then - simply repeating old themes with variations. Shortly before you were born, a hurricane inflicted major damage not far from where you live. Just after you were born, a psychotic young man massacred an innocent group of children, again not far from where you live. Perhaps the wise man who remarked "The only thing constant in this world is change" had it right after all.
But I think not. I believe there are some eternal truths and enduring constants, and I'd like to touch on just two of them. Right at the top of the list is love.
You were conceived and brought into this world as an act of love - a love announced and pronounced by your parents not so long ago. You are a product of that love, and their love will be a constant throughout your life. A parent's love is unconditional, no reservations, love regardless of anything you say or do.
But love is not just a warm, fuzzy feeling; it is a choice we make constantly and sometimes with our hearts in our throats. Sometimes love is uncharted territory, and deep in our heart we recognize that pain often accompanies love. Allowing others to love you can be threatening. As you grow older and choose to love others, you will find that some of them may betray you or move away or die. Grieving is the price we pay for loving and being loved.
But it is a price worth paying.
I want to congratulate you on your timing. Being born on the day after your daddy's birthday means you'll get to celebrate together, but still have your own unique day. Being born this Christmas season is also special. When I woke up early this morning, I glanced out my bathroom window and saw the dark night sky canopied with stars, and I saw the remnants of the first snow of winter reflecting that starlight. I imagine the sky wasn't all that different 20 centuries ago when another baby was born in a manger in a far-away country. That infant gifted and graced us with His presence, and our world has never been the same. A part of His legacy is the second eternal truth I'd like to focus on: the gift of hope.
To me, babies are a universal sign of hope, that muscular virtue that reassures us that no matter how dark and dismal and despairing life may sometimes seem, things can always get better. Persisting in hope is often a matter of focus. A wise person once said, "You can despair because roses have thorns, or you can rejoice because thorns have roses."
That hope was made visible this last Sunday when you were baptized during Mass on Holy Family Sunday - again, great timing! - and you officially joined the Catholic Christian family. That is a glorious day and a reason to celebrate in itself.
You have entered this world with advantages that would be the envy of many other babies. One of the main ones is a built-in support network: aunts and uncles and cousins and parents and grandparents and even great-grandparents. You haven't met many of them yet, but we all have one thing in common: We've got your back, Victoria. Relax and enjoy the ride.
Love,
Grandpa

Hi, Running on Debian 3.0 Woody (stable) with Hylafax 4.1.1. On arrival of a new fax, we have Hylafax set up to send an email message with the TIF image attached to a mail account. The problem is that all of a sudden hylafax started sending emails with corrupted TIF images. The strange thing is that the TIF file in /var/spool/hylafax/recvq/ is fine and can be viewed. I suspect the problem being somewhere in the /var/spool/hylafax/bin/faxrcvd shell script, and maybe in the "mimencode" program. However, I have tried manually encoding/decoding files on the command line with "mimencode", but everything seems to be fine. The only things I changed before the system had this problem are: - installed libmailtools-perl (perl module) - installed some extra ghostscript fonts I am really lost here. Has anyone had this problem before?! --*

Created with the beginning choir in mind, these are readily accessible arrangements of Christmas favorites for 2-octave choirs. Full and dynamic chords coupled with appealing arrangements characterize these settings. The eight titles are a blend of sacred and secular favorites providing ideal repertoire considerations for lesser experienced groups or ensembles needing to prepare yuletide selections with limited preparation time during the busy holiday season.

Jeff Baker, Warner Home Video’s EVP and GM of theatrical catalog, participated in an interview with Home Media Magazine and revealed some interesting thoughts behind Harry Potter Wizard’s Collection.
They confirmed that, like the Certificate of Authenticity suggested, there will only be 63,000 copies of the massive box set made available. Pre-orders are in the “tens of thousands” and once this set runs out they won’t be doing a second run. “In order to make an event out of it and to make it special for people to want to step up and buy it and commit to the type of investment that was required, we felt that it didn’t make sense just to make some ungodly number and sell it forever,” said Baker, “We wanted to make it a special one-time purchase opportunity.
It was also revealed that “a less robust, more cost-effective version of the boxed set” will be made available once the big box set runs out.
As for the price, which has long been criticized ($499.99 retail), Baker said “there is a high-end market for a franchise like this. I can’t say that every film would elicit that kind of response, where people are paying hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars. That’s still a lot of money to spend in a marketplace where you can buy a DVD at Walmart for $5.”
He continued, “clearly it’s for somebody who likes the whole notion of the complete repository of everything that ever existed on ‘Harry Potter’ — that, frankly, is ever going to be released on ‘Harry Potter,’ as far as I’m concerned. This is the definitive collection with everything in it. This is about as good as it’s going to get.”
Harry Potter Wizard’s Collection will be released September 7.

The Great Big Hyper-V Survey of 2012 Has Launched
Oct 1st
Posted by Hans Vredevoort in Hans Vredevoort
You then, we knew just 2 things about Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V and System Center 2012 was still pre-release. But now, both are generally available, and we want to learn about:
- Have you learned about these new technologies?
- Do you already use them?
- Are you planning on using them?
- How do you plan to use them?
Once again, this is a completely independent survey, run by 3 MVPs (me, Aidan Finn, and Damian Flynn), and Microsoft has had no input or involvement. They might help us promote it – because we do know that our findings were read by them and some of the information was a surprise for them.
The goal of the survey is to learn. We’re all bloggers and speakers and we want to deal with what’s relevant. You’re interested in seeing what other people are doing. We all want to learn from each other and we learned a lot last year.
This is a perfect time to speak – if Windows vNext development is like that of Windows Server 2012, then they’ll be spending the next 10-12 months talking, learning, etc. And the same might happen post-SP1 for System Center 2012.
So we ask you to:

The survey will close on December 1st 2012
Understanding my social capital is quite fun to do
May 12th
Posted by Hans Vredevoort in Hans Vredevoort
Those who follow me know that I am fairly active on Twitter and this blog. I decided to focus my blog very strictly around Microsoft Virtualization, Hyper-V, System Center, HP Server, Storage, Cluster and Cloud. On the other hand there is very little news about my personal life. Well maybe just the occasional exception to this rule. If I want to share something I use Facebook, but admittedly I use that sparingly. I also closed down my FourSquare account as I couldn’t think of a valid reason to use it, at least not for what I want to use social media for. There is one opportunity to get to know me a little better: the recent video interview with me by Carsten Rachfahl. We are also planning an interview with the entire Hyper-V.nu team by the way.
A few blogs back I introduced a site called the Archivist which saves and analyzes tweets. It then visualizes them in pretty graphic representations.
We are blogging to share knowledge and grow the Hyper-V community and that’s why I want to measure my influence by different counters. Of course the number of followers is one of the first counters I look at every day. It’s good to keep on seeing a steady growth and the magic number 1000 is approaching rapidly.
A relatively simple one is Twittercounter.com to just see some quick growth statistics. It predicts I will grow to 1015 followers in 15 days and 1800 in 172 days for instance.
One that I used right from the start is wefollow.com although their updates are very irregular. The idea is that you enter a number of keywords that describe your profile and wefollow.com calculates both your rank in number of Most followers for every keyword as well as Most Influential.
There’s also an easy way to check why your follower count goes down every now and then. If I have been very overenthusiastic, I lose 5 to 10 followers although they are mostly the ones who did not understand what Hyper-V was anyway. To check this I navigate to which can also show me all tweeps that I follow, but don’t follow back. So I can try and do something about it like “Hey! Please Follow me, I want to send you a DM”
Hyper-V and VMware Twitter Feed Analyzed using the Archivist
Apr 28th
Posted by Hans Vredevoort in Hans Vredevoort
During an entertaining #mvpchat today, someone mentioned a Twitter statistics site called the Archivist. It is very easy to use and the graphics are very attractive. Just enter a keyword or hashtag. You can save up to three archives. Initially saved archives are private, but you can make them public too. I have not found a way to share my public archives yet.

My wife Glade had the first art opening at her shop-within-a-shop Paper Party this past weekend. The show, called “Nature Club,” is a collection of paintings of cacti, produce, and whales by local cartoonist Melinda Tracy Boyce.
Each piece is a beautiful watercolor with great details. Here are some of my faves:
Cactus Club.
Whale Sandwich.
Crystal Cactus.
Check out this detail shot of that one (which is the largest at 22.25×30″):

Pat Aulisio has started a podcast where he talks to his friends. Although everyone who’s been on his show so far is involved in comics, the podcasts have mainly been about movies and tv shows and other things.
Photo from Pat’s announcement on his tumblr (Pat’s yawning on the right).
Yesterday he posted his episode with me, click here to check it out. We talked about a bunch of stuff, including:
Marfa Lights by Erica Lambertson Philippe (2011).
A photo from a performance I did with Lanneau White back in January of 2007 (I’m in a Miizzzard costume). Click here to see more images from a few of my performances.
My favorite Philip K Dick book (and therefore one of my favorite all-time sf books). Cover art by Peter Gudynas.
This past week was South by Southwest in Austin. One thing that Glade (I remade her website for her birthday, check it out) and I always like to do is go to Flatstock.
VGKids poster for Flatstock 33.
Flatstock is a convention of concert poster artists put on in various cities by the American Poster Institute. There are always tons of dope screenprints there. We always seek out the art prints and buy a few of those. My favorite this year were a group of screenprinters from Ypsilanti, Michigan called VGKids.
Another VGKids poster and stickers. I’m not sure who did this artwork – maybe it’s collaborative?
They also do prints for other people. Check out this two-color Tom Neely print they did:!
I know that I keep talking about this Glade and Mark comic, and it’s coming, I swear y’all, but other things just keep coming up that are time sensitive, like STAPLE! and now SXSW. Also, I have some other comics that I haven’t posted here that are even older, so I may post those first. We’ll see. So, please ignore my empty promises and I’ll stop making them.
Anyway, for the sixth year in a row, the Awthum Empire, producers of fringe, DIY and avant garde culture in Austin and beyond, is putting on their one-day music festival, Awthum Fetht. And, just like last year, I drew a flyer for it:
Also, if you’re a band interested in a flyer or other artwork, please feel free to contact me.
Hey yawl, the Gold County Paper Mill and Glademade had a blast at STAPLE! last weekend, thanks to everyone who hung out and bought stuff!
Zoom out shot of the table (I was able to get everything in the image except for the second Glademade card rack). Glade’s face is like “why are you d00dz hiding?”
We met a ton of kewl people and got to hang out with kewl people we’ve met at past STAPLE!s (that plural spelling of STAPLE! is straight from the style guide, I swear).
Now everyone is showing their faces. From left to right: Michael Miles, David Fullen, Glade Hensel.
Some highlights:
I hope to see you all again (and more people!) at STAPLE! 2012. Also, if you’re wondering, I’ll start posting the eight-page Glade and Mark comic on Friday. Click here for additional photos and GCPM-centric commentary):
This print’s for sale. I’m gonna try out one of these fancy Paypal buttons:

If you’re ordering from outside the U.S. I’m going to have to bill you extra for the additional shipping.

Now think about your computer. You can dose it with antivirus software to make it resistant to infection, but if a virus or worm manages to slip through, you have no recourse but to wipe your hard drive clean and start over. Or do you?
Christopher Kruegel, associate professor of computer science at UC Santa Barbara and a member of the campus's Computer Security Group, has developed a new security software that can identify and neutralize viruses after they've infected a user's machine, even if that virus has no known signatures.
"Antivirus software companies focus on the end host and try to prevent malware from infecting your computer in the first place," explained Kruegel. "They have a lot of tools sitting on the host that scan files for these signatures or that try to identify programs that behave in a surprising fashion and then they block them. But the numbers show that they are not very effective."
Kruegel and his colleagues, Giovanni Vigna, professor of computer science at UCSB, and Engin Kirda, professor of computer science at Institute Eurecom in France, have taken a different approach, particularly with bots and botnets. Rather than coming between a computer and the virus, their security software comes between the infected computer and the malicious master server that has taken control of it. "The virus sitting on the machine doesn't have a negative impact," said Kruegel. "But it becomes hugely problematic when it begins to talk to that remote infrastructure and responds to commands."
They have formed a company, LastLine, Inc. as in "last line of defense" to develop the software that interferes with the communication between the infected computer and the command and control infrastructure that wants it to act in some nefarious manner such as stealing bank account numbers and other data, or sending spam mail to a designated group of e-mail addresses. The software works alongside existing antivirus programs and firewalls.
Antivirus software is ineffective, Kruegel explained, because the cyber-criminals create new versions of their binaries so quickly that the software companies have difficulty keeping up with them. "There are mutation engines that take a program and create many different versions so they always look different. But it's the same program," he said. "With LastLine, we give up on trying to defend the machine. But once the machine is compromised, we block the connection between the malware and its command and control server. It cannot receive commands, and it cannot send out information."
By blocking the master servers, cyber-criminals are forced to construct command and control structures elsewhere, which is far more difficult than mutating a piece of malware, Kruegel noted.
Malware can make it onto a user's computer in many ways, but the most common is a drive-by download, which happens while the user is surfing the Internet. "You go to Web sites that are malicious and they send some script that exploits your browser by downloading the malware," said Kruegel. "It can also happen through e-mail and file-sharing sites where you download a program."
Recently, Kruegel was recognized for his accomplishments in Internet security, particularly in developing software that shuts down botnets. In the current issue of Technology Review, a publication of M.I.T., Kruegel is named to the magazine's TR35, a list published annually that recognizes 35 outstanding innovators under the age of 35. The award covers a wide range of fields, including biotechnology, materials, computer hardware, energy, transportation, and the Internet.

Matt,
Watching porn is not the problem. Teaching people that there’s something wrong with people who watch porn is the problem.
I guess there will be a lot of gorillas in hell.
LOL love this comment.
This is one family’s experience, and it is here to help others who might benefit from hearing their story..
Pornography of course is still something many argue over to this day- I don’t think we are taking a stand either way on this issue. We are not advocating that people look at porn. We are not advocating that people indulge themselves at every opportunity. We are simply sharing the story of a family that has come to realize that the guilt and shame fueled a problematic behavior.
Perhaps we need to define what we mean by pornography because sometimes religions will lump all pornography into one category when there is a wide range from violent porn to bestiality to soft porn etc.
Your comment seems to disapprove of our efforts to bring to light an important issue that many face upon leaving the church. I think this is an important discussion to have and it is often difficult to bring into the open because it is treated as taboo. The individuals in the the video are brave to come out and openly discuss these things. They have touched on the role that guilt and shame has played in their relationship and this is another important thing to take into consideration when people condemn masturbation and pornography- they often do not realize that the guilt and sexual repression can be the source of the compulsive behavior in the first place. Over and over again I have heard exmormons say that the compulsive behavior of viewing pornography leaves when they stop punishing themselves and feeling guilty for being a normal human being. If you think this message should be hidden and kept from individuals who are still beating themselves up over this issue, I would have to strongly disagree with you.
On another note, I believe the Mormon church does much good- and I hope to hold on to the good that it teaches. I refuse to call everything the church stands for “evil” or “bad”. I do believe however, that the psychological implications of the Mormon belief system are damaging to one’s self identity. The good values taught in the Mormon church do not outweigh losing yourself to a group identity. I say keep the good and throw out the bad.
I hope this clarifies the purpose of what we are doing here on this website and particularly with these videos you have commented on.
I hope you had a chance to watch both of the videos and that you will be back to watch the final two on this subject next Saturday..
Thank you so much for sharing your story here Ruben! I’m glad you are alive to tell your story!
Same with the employees at Pixar and Apple!.
Greg I hope things work out for your son. I’m glad these videos spoke to you, and I hope they continue to help others in the future!
Hey Mark!
Very good question. I think many people can have a difficult time moving away from certain habits – and I’m not talking about masturbation and pornography here- I’m talking about habitual thoughts and indoctrination. I read a comment one time from an Ex Jehovah’s Witness and they mentioned that they “knew” they were condemned to hell. It was sad to read the comment from someone who felt so sure about things that they could not love themselves even after separating from the group. I think sexuality can be a difficult thing to “switch on” when you have suppressed it for long periods. I listened to a podcast recently which spoke about women in the Mormon faith (or others) who are unable to “switch on” after marriage. The sexual repression affects them so completely that they no longer have the ability to have a healthy sex life. My only advice is to accept yourself for who you are and not look at yourself as broken. I know that is probably easier said then done..
Our message is more about the damage that comes from the cycle of guilt and depression that follows from the constant condemnation of porn- not that porn is good. I personally think that the very word “porn” is used without a proper definition as well. Some forms of pornography are harmful to those that produce it and I would never condone such a thing. But more importantly, exmormons do not have a unified belief. Many will hold a vastly different opinion on this subject of pornography. But that is not the only thing addressed in these videos. The topic of masturbation is discussed. This is basically a conversation that is desperately needed, and we certainly don’t claim to have the final answer on such matters. We do believe that it is important to discuss these things because people have literally died over the self hatred that can be caused by such things. The topic is taboo- and yet it effects so many. We are here to help others and share the other side of the story. I sincerely hope you can respect.
Thanks Lang! The Bodie’s definitely deserve a round of applause for being in these videos!! agree, leaving the church is not a solution to all problems by any means. Counseling could be a great step for instance. But for some people, leaving the church helped immensely. For some people it didn’t. This site is to give hope to those who leave, and provide understanding for those who too often judge or condemn ExMormons. The judgments and condemnation only cause pain and loneliness. It makes for a difficult transition out of the church to a healthy and balanced life..
Thanks for sharing.
Their reason for leaving was doctrinal, it didn’t have to do with this issue. This was just a positive side effect of reevaluating their morals after leaving the church.!
Thanks so much for your comment! I’m glad these videos are helping so many people..
Khaled on the main stage was tremendous, Raghu Dixit was top stuff as well. Looking forward to Robert Plant in the rain. Ken and Sue.———————–

You will have to forgive me for not giving you a tutorial today, but I'm sending you on a little trip instead. Ohdeedoh (the coolest site ever!!!) asked me if they could do a little interview/feature about my blog. I didn't have to think too long about that one! YES!!! You'll find the post right HERE. If you've never visited ohdeedoh, go check it out. You'll fall in love.
On another note, Friday and Saturday was our big event where we introduced our hair accessories. It was a crazy busy weekend. It went well and I had SO much fun meeting some of you. That was really the best part.
Loopdeelou is now officially online AND we are doing a giveaway to introduce it to all of you. Three lucky winners will win a headband of their choice. Just leave a comment. You can leave an extra comment if you are a follower, to increase your chances of winning. Winners will be announced on Friday.
PLUS, we're offering free shipping to all of you for a week. Just tell us in the comment of your order that you roar.
Our site isn't completely done, but if you wouldn't mind taking a peek, I'd love to get some of your feedback.
Do you need to see every head band modeled or is a simple, clear picture enough?
Does the site seem easy to use?
Any suggestions?
We will be adding the hard headbands soon, but I just couldn't wait to share it all with you!!!
Thank you all for your support and kind comments. It means a lot to me. Have a great day. Thanks for stopping by!
The first to leave a comment...does that increase my chances of winning a fabulous headband!?! LOL
This is my other comment since I'm a follower...double the chance of winning, gotta love that!

I love the headbands! I think my favorite is the "Spring has Sprung". So cute!
Ooooh, the "Back in Black" one is gorgeous! Really like that one! Well done! :)
Very pretty headbands, I just got my haircut so I'll be needing some of these!
The site feels a little bit dark to me. And perhaps you could use labels to sort the headbands into color, those with feathers, those with leather etc.? It would let people search for what they want quicker :) Just a suggestion!
Thanks for the chance to win!
and I'm a follower from way back :)
Ooo totally excited! These are beautiful!
And a second for being a follower! :)
I'm now a follower! kapfife at gmail dot com

Enabling the HTML5 parser in Firefox 3.6.
When Firefox 3.6 was released in January, it had a HTML5 parser included but which wasn’t on by default. This simple post told you how to enable it. It seems to have been quite popular throughout the year which is odd since it’s up to version 3.6.13 by now and is enabled by default and the method described is no longer relevant.
Fading issue with repeating background transparent image in Internet Explorer
Quite a long winded title but it needs to be. Internet Explorer has problems rendering a transparent image that is repeated, if the image in question has the dimensions of 1×1. Understandably popular as it’s a bizarre issue.
The confusion surrounding HTML5
This is an article I wrote for the online version of PC Pro which talks about how the term HTML5 has caused a lot of confusion due to its misuse by some big name companies. It also attempts to address them. I hope it succeeded.
Shadowbox and Internet Explorer 8
Shadow box (a popular and powerful lightbox by Michael J. I. Jackson) used to cause a JavaScript error in Internet Explorer 8. This post explained how to fix it. Probably irrelevant these days.
Accessing data records from Excel and CSV files in VB.NET
This post explained how to access and read data from both Excel and CSV files in VB.NET. I had come across the issue at work and decided to pull all the information I learnt together.
Adventures with @font-face
The @font-face is a CSS rule that was given a new lease of life with CSS3. This post attempted to provide a simple tutorial on how to go about using it to embed fonts into your web page.
Twitter Tools 2.0 and WordPress 2.8.6
At the time Twitter Tools and WordPress 2.8.6 didn’t get on and there were authentication errors galore. This was one solution to this problem which worked for me. Irrelevant now though as WordPress is on 3.0.2 and Twitter Tools is on 2.4.
Grid Focus HTML5 WordPress theme
I had been using the Grid Focus WordPress theme for a while on this site and decided to convert it to valid HTML5. On doing this I released it (with original developer Derek Punsalan’s permission) as a download from this site.
Generating a relative path in C#
I had come across an issue at work where I needed to find a relative path between one absolute directory and another in C# and was unable to find a native library that provided the functionality. A Google search turned up some useful code and I reposted it.
Introducing HTML5 – book review
Back in September I read and reviewed Introducing HTML5 by Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp and posted it here.

Edward Burtynsky is featured in this clip talking about what we watched. We will be discussing the ideas of economic growth, economic development, international trade, globalization as well as the idea of negative externalities in our course. We should keep in mind the visuals we got from Burtynsky's photographs - pictures are very powerful media of ideas. Maybe they should even haunt us.

Health insurance stocks sank deeper than the broader market Wednesday after President Barack Obama's re-election helped
clarify the future of his health care overhaul, a sweeping law that some investors fear will pinch profits in the coming years.
The overhaul aims to cover millions of uninsured people. While that means new business for insurers, the law also imposes fees and coverage restrictions on the sector.
Starting in 2014, insurers will have to pay annual fees that total $8 billion that year and then climb to top $14 billion by 2018. The law restricts how much insurers can vary their pricing based on factors such as age and health—key tools they use to ensure that they have enough to cover medical claims.
It also stipulates, among other things, that insurers spend certain percentages of the premiums they collect on care, or pay rebates to customers.
Insurers like Indianapolis-based WellPoint Inc., with large portions of their business in the individual and small employer group markets, are expected to be affected the most by the fees and restrictions.
WellPoint's third-quarter earnings trumped Wall Street expectations, but the health insurer's stock tumbled after the election. Shares of WellPoint dropped 5.5 percent, or $3.35, to close at $57.85 Wednesday. Share were down 1.6 percent Thursday morning, to $56.91.
Investors also worry about online exchanges that will be set up as part of the overhaul to help people compare and buy insurance policies. Morningstar analyst Matt Coffina cites concerns that these exchanges will take customers from the more-profitable employer-sponsored coverage market.
The overhaul also cuts funding for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government's Medicare program for the elderly and disabled. That could pressure profits for companies like Humana Inc., for which Medicare Advantage plans make up a large concentration of its business.
Other health insurers saw their stock drop Wednesday. Humana's stock sank 7.5 percent, or $5.75, to $70.41 per share. Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc., the nation's largest insurer, dropped 3.5 percent, or $1.99, to $54.40. Aetna Inc. fell 3.6 percent, or $1.61, to $42.95.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index, meanwhile, was down about 2 percent.
Cigna Corp.'s stock dropped only 21 cents, to $53.12. Analysts see Cigna as being less vulnerable to reform, since it has a broader business portfolio than most of its competitors. That includes a growing international business.

For you, it might be Kurt Cobain. Or Gene Autry. Or Jimi Hendrix.
For me, it’s Woody Guthrie.
While I could look at most of the instruments on display at the new “Guitars: Roundups to Rockers” exhibition
at the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art (through Aug. 4) with cool detachment—admiring the workmanship,
acknowledging influential designs, and imagining what went into their gashes and chips—it was Guthrie’s Martin
000-18 acoustic guitar, among the more than 100 guitars on display, that stopped me.
I didn’t need an iPod and ear buds to hear “Pastures of Plenty” or “The Biggest Thing That Man Has Ever Done” or “The Ballad of Pretty Boy Floyd.” Those songs were playing on their own in my mind’s jukebox as the inanimate guitar rested on its stand. For an exhibition such as this, what’s on display is only a part of the experience. You bring the rest with you.
If you’ve ever been to Cleveland’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, you know the feeling. Even if you’ve never plucked a string and don’t know a fingerboard from a whammy bar, you carry with you a staggering number of guitar tunes, most loaded with some kind of association.
Esthetic objectivity may have nothing to do with it. The sight of, say, Buddy Holly’s Gibson acoustic
with its tooled-leather cover (an attempt by the young singer to ape a similar cover used by Elvis Presley) or Johnny Cash’s
Martin D-21 or Jerry Garcia’s Doug Irwin “Tiger” can stir up a host of feelings.
At the Eiteljorg show—drawn from both museums and the private collections of Jim Irsay, Vince Gill and others—you don’t need to rely entirely on your memory. To fully enjoy the experience—and to make it last three times as long—it’s best to pick up a programmed iPad on the way in that allows you to listen to music at just about every display. That means your look at Garcia’s guitar is enhanced with a “Truckin’” recording from Deer Creek Music Center. And Duane Allman’s Gibson SG slide guitar (loaned by Graham Nash) has “Statesboro Blues” as its soundtrack.
Less storied instruments are available for hands-on play. Quickie lessons are provided at select times. And don’t be
surprised if touring musicians pop by the Eiteljorg to pay tribute to their influences.
“Guitars” isn’t an arbitrary addition to the Eiteljorg. The exhibition makes a strong case for the development of the guitar in the American West, not only for its country/cowboy roots but in such innovators as Charlie Christian, an Oklahoman who is credited as the first to use the electric guitar as a lead instrument in jazz bands. But the museum doesn’t push too hard in trying to find connections. And it shouldn’t have to. This exhibition speaks—musically—for itself.
My only disappointment? There wasn’t a mirror at the back of the Woody Guthrie case so that I could see the other side of the instrument where Guthrie had carved “This machine kills Fascists.”•

Arguably, the first duty of a country is to protect its citizens. The question is how to achieve that in an urbanizing world that is becoming more interconnected, fast-paced and unpredictable every day.
In recent years, forward-thinking city managers, police chiefs, fire chiefs and other officials have made great strides in applying innovative, community-based approaches and new technologies to help reduce urban crime and improve emergency response. But the challenges to public safety continue to grow. Fortunately, new capabilities are now at our disposal to help make urban public safety systems not just more connected and efficient, but smarter.
Progressive leaders around the world are undertaking a transformational shift. Instead of merely responding to crimes and emergencies after the fact, they are analyzing, anticipating and actually working to prevent them. They're doing so with smart systems that capture data from myriad instrumented and interconnected processes, devices and objects, and then apply intelligence to this welter of information to detect patterns and take action in real time.
We see it happening today in New York City, where police commanders are using analytics and visualization tools to see crime patterns as they are forming. The city's Real Time Crime Center system can quickly query millions of pieces of information to uncover previously unknown data relationships and points of connection. Integrated crime information analysis, delivered in real time, has helped improve public safety, with a 27% drop in crime since 2001. New York is now ranked as the safest large city in the U.S.
We see it happening in Madrid. Following the terrorist attacks of March 2004, the city developed a new Emergency Response Centre so today, when a citizen witnesses an accident and places an emergency call, the system simultaneously alerts the police, the ambulance service and, if needed, the fire brigade. The smart system can recognize if alerts from several different sources relate to a single or multiple incidents, and assign the right resources based on the requirements coming from the ground.
We see it happening in Poland, where personal and vehicle IDs can be instantly checked in an EU-wide database. The new system has improved police operations, helping to shorten the time for queries, reduce errors and allow police to verify information and uncover potential threats to local and national security, through use at Poland's borders. Overall, the system contributed to a 66% increase in arrest rates for Polish police in 2008.
Finally, we see it happening in Chicago. In the past, video from surveillance cameras was mostly used as evidence after an incident had occurred. Today, 911 dispatchers have access to video from a multitude of cameras citywide, with advanced analytics built into the infrastructure, that are connected to a fiber/wireless network to assist the operator with potential "eyes-on-the-scene" in the vicinity of an incident. The video image they receive helps them dispatch exactly the right services immediately.
IBM is deploying similar systems around the world, and building in methods to protect citizens' privacy by blurring individuals' faces unless an incident is detected—at which point the authorized police personnel can enter a code to see the complete image.
For all cities and regions competing in the global marketplace for work, investment and talent, safety and security are crucial factors in determining overall quality of life. Which is why smarter public safety isn't just a country's responsibility, it's also a priority for the success of businesses, communities and civil society at large.
Let's build a smarter planet.

Friends' support can help cancer patients
Ask questions, but stay positive
iStockPhoto/asiseeit
Lucie Shores, Contributing writer
When someone you know shares the news of a life-threatening illness, it can change the way you see that person and alter how you interact with her.
Of course, relationships are affected during a disease as devastating as breast cancer, but we have some control over whether this effect is negative or positive. Even though you may not know what to say in a given moment or what to do in a given situation, experts remind us the relationship that counts is with the person, not with the illness.
Breast cancer is one of the most commonly found types of cancer. A woman's concept of breast cancer may color all her interactions, making it difficult to relate normally. According to studies, attitude can affect treatment and have real consequences in terms of well-being and survival.
Doctors agree that the benefits of intimacy and personal support are immeasurable in the battles we have with major illness. Certainly the most important thing anyone can do to support a friend or relative with breast cancer is to be there while she begins to navigate the grueling course of treatment, recovery and ongoing lifestyle adjustments.
In support of the patient, don't assume she will be shuttling between home and hospital. Each woman's ability to deal with cancer differs, but most patients benefit from experiencing continued successes of working, the highs of being part of a lively community, and the intimacy of family and friends. However, if there is too much stress in continuing to interact as expected, the best things can include travel and time for reorientation.
Offer to accompany the patient on short trips or provide opportunities for recreation or simply rest and relaxation.
The practical concerns of cancer patients are overwhelming. Be up-front about the uncertainty the patient may feel, but try to focus on available solutions rather than the list of concerns.
Ask questions that open the door to communication, but allow the patient to decide whether she wants to talk about the diagnosis or about life as usual. Present the opportunity to choose communication or silence, and be aware if she starts to slip into depression and isolation. As someone outside the process, you can keep these things in mind better than the one inside the emotional maelstrom.
The stress of both certainly affect one's perspective, strength, and will to recover. 2013, Internet Broadcasting. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

When Bush finished his second term in 2009 he left office with an approval rating of 22 percent. That number was one of the lowest in history as three out of four Americans did not approve of how Bush handled his eight years in office, according to CBS News. That number slowly started to turn around, though, and The Washington Post reported his approval rating had surged 30 points by the time he was set to release his memoir, "Decision Points" at the end of 2010.
Now, with his close aide Condoleezza Rice in the conversation as Mitt Romney's possible running mate and brother Jeb stumping for the GOP, Bush is no longer considered political poison as he was when John McCain struggled to distance himself from the then-president's unpopularity in the 2008 campaign.
On Tuesday, Elton John continued that trend. He cited Bush's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in 2004 for providing treatment and prevention awareness for Africans. PEPFAR was a $15 billion program, reports the Power Players. John admitted that meeting Bush at the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004 softened his view of Bush.
"I didn't like his policies but I have to say when I met him, I found him charming," John said. "I found him well informed and I found him determined to do something about the AIDS situation so I changed my opinion of him...I learned a lesson."
The Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer also praised President Barack Obama for revoking the ban on entry into the United States by HIV-positive people, repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and endorsing gay marriage.
Elton John isn't the only liberal to rethink his stance on the former president. Debra Messing, once the star of television's "Will and Grace," has traditionally advocated for Democrats but she also voiced her support for Bush.
"President Bush created PEPFAR,"."
Since Obama took his seat in the Oval Office, Bush has avoided the spotlight. "Decision Points" has sold around 2.5 million copies and in 2010 he was making $150,000 per speaking engagement.
ABC News reported Tuesday Bush stopped by Romney's campaign office for a pep-talk and encouraged staffers "to seize the moment." But he recently announced he will not attend the Republican National Convention in Tampa. Former first lady Laura Bush said the couple is focusing on their AIDS work and is out of politics for good.

Large Group of Ambassadors Visit Exhumation Site
The Embassy of the Netherlands and the International Commission on Missing Persons jointly organised a visit to the ongoing exhumation at Seljani near Rogatica.
In addition to the Netherlands, group included ambassadors and other diplomatic staff from the embassies of Austria, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States of America. At the site they were given presentations by Kathryne Bomberger, ICMP Chief of Staff and Dr. Mark Skinner, ICMP Director of Forensic Sciences as well as Amor Masovic, co-chairman of the Federation Commission, the Commission member, Sejo Koso and the Cantonal Prosecutor who is in charge of the exhumation.The site the diplomats visited may contain the remains of as many as 22 missing persons and dates from July 1992. Over the next few weeks, the remains will be taken to ICMP facilities, where an anthropological examination will be conducted and samples taken for DNA analysis.
The Ambassadors believe that it is important for all Heads of Mission to see aspects of the exhumations process for themselves as the need to resolve the fate of missing persons is crucial for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Ambassador of the Embassy of the Netherlands, H.E. Rob Bosscher, co-hosted the visit. The Netherlands has been the second largest contributor to ICMP’s work every year since 1998.
Ambassador Bosscher said:
“International support is vital to the process of resolving the fate of missing persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The cooperation that we see between the entities is encouraging. It is by working together on this issue that the governments of the region will be able to bring answers to the families of missing persons who have waited so long.”
ICMP Chief of Staff, Kathryne Bomberger said:
“The work of ICMP is unique in the world and it is through the generous and continuing support of our contributing governments that we have been able to achieve what we have. However, without the cooperation of the entity governments of BiH with ICMP and with each other, these results could not have been achieved”.
To date ICMP has collected a total of 61, 698 blood samples representing 24,449 missing individuals. ICMP has achieved DNA reports representing 5,684 individuals.

The newly formed Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemical Producers Association's first annual conference will debate the hottest topics facing the Middle East
LATER THIS month, petrochemical producers, traders and logistics operators will meet in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates for the first annual forum of the newly created Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemical Producers Association (GPCA). The meeting, to be attended by 400 delegates, will take its place in the annual calendar alongside North America's NPRA conference in March, Asia's APIC event in May, Europe's EPCA meeting in September, and Latin America's APLA event in November.
Abdullah Bin Zaid Al Hagbani, secretary general of GPCA, which was formed earlier this year, comments, "The outlook for our industry has never been stronger, particularly when one focuses on massive liquidity in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region combined with the obvious commercial advantages of hydrocarbon production." But, he adds, "We need to address a number of important issues in order to improve our market position and further strengthen our reputation as one of the world's most important regions for both petrochemical production and consumption."
Al Hagbani expects the new forum, taking place on December 16-17, will prove an excellent platform from which to analyze the issues. A strong lineup of speakers will offer their expertise and views on these issues, which surround feedstocks, the continued rapid buildup of investment in the region, the need to enhance logistics and infrastructure to cope with burgeoning export volumes, and the encouragement of downstream user industries in Middle East countries.
Speakers and session chairmen do not come just from local companies, such as SABIC, Saudi Aramco, Equate and Qapco, but global operators, such as ExxonMobil Chemicals, Shell Chemicals and Borealis, many of which have long-established partnerships in the Middle East. They will also be addressing environmental, health and safety issues, and technology and research topics.
The GPCA was conceived in 2004 by its founding members (see GPCA Founder Companies) who wanted to form a dedicated and nonprofit association serving members with a variety of data, technical assistance and resources. The organization was officially launched on March 1, 2006 in Dubai, with the stated aim to "be the regional voice of the Gulf's petrochemicals and chemical industry in noncommercial activities, and to serve as the regional platform for information exchange." It will identify and facilitate common interests of its members and "assure the harmonious and sustainable growth of the sector in the region."
The GPCA chairman, SABIC's Mohamed Al-Mady, says, "The petrochemical industry in the Gulf region broke new ground with the launch of GPCA. With the formation of the GPCA, I see the dawn of a new era of cooperation among our members, associated vendors, government bodies and our customers."
The creation of a petrochemical association for the Middle East Gulf states is long overdue. But now also seems an appropriate time to set one up, as investment in the region is booming, and the leading players are all becoming actors on the global chemicals stage.
SABIC has set the lead, with its acquisitions in Europe, first of DSM's petrochemicals operations in the Netherlands and Germany, and now those of Huntsman in the UK (formerly ICI assets).
But there are other examples emerging, notably the Petrochemical Industries Co. and Dow Chemical deal to create two joint ventures: MEGlobal, for global production and marketing of monoethylene glycol (MEG), and Equipolymer, for purified terephthalic acid/polyethylene tephthalate (PTA/PET) in Europe.
Others will no doubt follow, as Middle East companies achieve added scale through their investments. Although not part of GPCA, Iran's National Petrochemical Co. is also showing signs of emerging as an international player, with a failed bid for Basell being followed with agreements with Venezuela and China.
Middle East executives have been in regular attendance as delegates, and in some cases, speakers, at the established regional petrochemical meetings such as EPCA and NPRA. But now they will have their own forum in which to discuss issues that are particularly pertinent to the region, building on from the previous biannual Marichem meetings that used to serve in this role.
Notable issues facing the region are feedstock availability and pricing, current constraints on project execution, logistics and infrastructure availability, and the development of downstream industries in the Gulf countries. Improvement in this area is necessary to boost domestic demand and create much-needed jobs in these countries. Funding of projects seems to be of little issue as there is huge liquidity in the region's banking and capital markets, so much so that there is currently a move in Saudi Arabia to publicly list many of the current projects, with initial public offerings attracting plenty of interest.
It will be interesting to see how GPCA tackles many of these issues, and to see how it grows through wider membership. The nucleus is certainly there and the founding members have moved rapidly since the official creation of the association this year to put together a major international event. Critical mass is now needed to give the initiative greater momentum.

CEO Ellen Kullman on Tuesday described “a developing recovery that is shaped different by market and geography”.
Not surprisingly, DuPont’s
Central
But the picture is shifting slightly and the outlook is certainly more positive than three months ago.
There are signs of restocking in the automobile-related product chains that are so important to the company. Kullman said in a conference call that the third quarter seemed to represent true demand for DuPont’s industrial polymers and performance elastomers. The sign must be welcome.
All in all, the chemicals giant is seeing its markets stabilise and some early indications of an upturn.
Titanium dioxide, an early cycle indicator, is doing well and DuPont is almost sold out. Other important products for the company, however, are still feeling the squeeze. It could be months before they might be expected to recover.
The company continues to do well in driving costs down and is on target to save $1bn (€670m) in fixed costs this year.
Kullman said $750m of these costs savings can be retained over the longer term. There is a clear commitment to deliver on promises.
What is also important is that DuPont’s product development engine continues to fire on all cylinders.
The company launched 323 new products in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 1,107. That’s a 50% higher launch rate than last year.
The new products help drive growth in the continued weak market environment and will help lay the foundations for faster growth.
On the demand side, then, there is not a great deal to get excited about. But given the unclear global economic picture, that is hardly surprising.
DuPont is confident enough, nevertheless, to forecast that its earnings per share this year will be at the top of an earlier stated range. A solid foundation has been laid in 2009. The company is holding on to product prices.
It is the degree to which savings have been made and the research engine delivered that have contributed immensely to confidence this year. Yet the market has begun to more forcefully respond.
Erratic as the recovery may be, it appears as if there are more widespread opportunities to grasp.

LONDON (ICIS)--The 2013 outlook of the European styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) market is very uncertain as tyre sales look set to continue falling next year driven by poor car and replacement tyre demand.
About two-thirds of SBR output is used by the tyre industry.
The monthly contract price of 1500 grade SBR in December was at €1,980-2,050/tonne ($add conversion) free delivered (FD) northwest Europe (NWE), while 1723 grade was at €1,880-1,920/tonne ($2,507- 2,560/tonne) FD NWE. The price of 1783 grade was at €1,830-1,870/tonne FD NWE.
The last time SBR prices were so low was in February 2011, and further price drops are likely during the first quarter of 2013, sources said.
SBR 1500 grade spot prices are at €1,750-1,850/tonne FD NWE, while 1723 and 1783 are at €1,700-1,750/tonne FD NWE, the lowest since December 2010.
Because feedstock costs are relentlessly high and there is no sign of relief, SBR producers will have to face some tough choices next year. They will either have to cut operating rates to balance supply with demand if sales do not pick up, or shut down for maintenances, sources said.
Right now, very few sources think that demand would pick up during January as downstream demand is poor. The consensus is that the first half of 2013 will probably bring no real improvement, and even a potential recovery in the third quarter will be short lived as during the fourth quarter demand traditionally slips as plants destock and shut down for the Christmas and New Year holiday period.
A major SBR manufacturer said that there is no reason for SBR demand to increase during the first half, looking at forecasts about car and tyre sales.
In its latest report, the Germany-based Centre of Automotive Management forecast that car sales in Europe will continue a decline which began in the aftermath of the eurozone debt crisis and the international banking crisis back in 2008-2009.
Major tyre manufacturers in Europe have also painted a gloomy picture about 2013. Because fuel prices are high and people drive less they need fewer tyres, which all mean that European demand will be unlikely to pick up in the near term.
The situation is somewhat better in emerging countries where the burgeoning middle-classes can afford to buy cars, supporting tyre demand.
However, with shrinking incomes and growing debts, the main concern of European consumers is to pay their debts off and increase their savings in case things get worse, and this has a massive impact on sales of cars and replacement tyres.
And with budget cuts, falling central expenditure and the end of many government incentives such as scrap car schemes that helped car and tyre sales, the industry has been left to its own devices to deal with the situation.
During the first nine months of 2012 exports from the EU were booming, up 45% from the same period in 2011, which helped EU producers sell surplus material outside Europe. However, because European feedstock butadiene (BD) and SBR prices are now higher than in major markets in Asia, the arbitrage window between the two continents is closed.
Unless European prices drop to competitive levels, there is little hope exports can rise, and in turn this presents a danger that Asian sellers will enter the European market, creating further competition in an already long.

After obtaining Ph.Ds from both the University of Pennsylvania in Biomedical Engineering and from the Medical school of the University of Colorado (1967), Dov Jaron collaborated on the development of the intra-aortic balloon pump with heart surgeon Adrian Konforwitz. This device, which improves the circulation of those who have suffered from a heart attack or who have problems coming off the oxygenator used during surgery, is now owned by nearly every hospital. Computer modeling was central to his development of the intra-aortic balloon pump and he continued to design an engineering model that predicts various properties of the cardiovascular system and he made simulation packages for others. Jaron initiated the Biomedical Engineering program at the University of Rhode Island (1973) and built up the education program at the Biomedical and Engineering Science Institute at Drexel University as its Director(1980). He directed the division of Biological and Critical Positions and the Engineering Director to the National Science Center (1991) and was in charge of the Biomedical Technology program at the NIH (1996), where he organized a conference convincing the NIH of the importance of biomedical engineering to research in biology and medicine. Jaron also served as President of the IEEE EMBS. Subsequently, he returned to Drexel, which was now the school of Biomedical Engineering, Science, and Health Systems, as the Calhoun distinguished professor of engineering and medicine. He is currently working on a Navy-funded protective suit for pilots, in which he simulates the effect of G stress on gas transport and recirculation in the microcirculation to integrate with his hemodynamic model. Jaron foresees the incorporation of the chemical effects of drug therapy in the computer modeling of the cardiovascular system.
DOV JARON: An Interview Conducted by Frederik Nebeker, IEEE History Center, 12 October 1999
Interview # 371:Dov Jaron, an oral history conducted in 1999 by Frederik Nebeker, IEEE History Center, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.
Interview: Dov JaronInterviewer: Frederik NebekerDate: 12 October 1999Place: Atlanta, Georgia
Nebeker:
Can you tell me where and when you were born, and a little about your family?
Jaron:
My family immigrated to Israel from Lithuania in Europe in the late twenties. They came as part of the pioneers’ movement to work the land and to settle the country. We settled the country. I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. It was Palestine in 1935. I went to school in Israel, and went to the army and did my service.
It was rather unsettled times there after the war.
Yes, they were.
How did that affect you personally?
The British army had what they called a Jewish Brigade, and my father volunteered to fight in the War, and he went to Europe to Italy with the Allied forces. He was away for almost five years during the war.
Can you remember the war itself?
I can remember it very well. I remember when Rommel was advancing in Northern Africa and getting closer to Egypt.
He got into Egypt, or very close anyway.
Yes. Clearly we were very, very concerned because we started hearing what was happening in Europe.
Did you have brothers and sisters?
Yes, I had one brother. Those were very tough times. Then of course in 1948 the country got its independence. I was thirteen at the time, living in Tel Aviv.
Was there any fighting there in 1948?
Yes, as a matter of fact. We actually lived in a suburb of the city, and I remember there was an armament factory within a half of a mile from our house. I remember attacks on that factory and planes diving right over our house to hit the factory. It was not very pleasant. You never knew whether the bombs were actually going to fall where they were supposed to fall. But I was fairly young at that time.
Your father came through World War II fine?
Yes, he returned from the War. Not very many people returned, but he did.
Did your education get disrupted?
Actually it was not disrupted. Schools went on and they functioned normally. There were some disruptions, but not very serious.
Was Hebrew the language of the schools?
Yes. After I finished school, just like any other male and female citizen, I went into the armed services.
What year was that?
I was eighteen, so that would have been in 1953. I spent two years in the military. My service in the military was not very difficult because I was in a special branch of the military, which was divided into groups of about thirty or forty and sent to settlements along the border. In those days the country tried to settle the border, and those were locations that guarded the border. We were sent to one of those settlements, and I spent basically three years there.
What was your position in the army?
I was a Private. I guess it was infantry. In those days you really did not distinguish, except that we had a very small Air Force, but that was it.
Your MOS (military occupation specialty), the job that they are trained for, could be a technician or infantry.
Private First Class.
An all-purpose soldier. But you were not into technical—radar or anything?
No, just regular service, regular infantry. Some of my friends lost their lives during that period.
There was fighting?
There was fighting in 1956, and some of my best friends never came back from the fighting. Then I decided I had had enough of rural life. The settlements basically were agricultural settlements. They were kibbutzim.
You served what was required, and then went to the University?
I served what was required, and then I stayed on past that for a couple of extra years. It was not in the army; I had just become a member of that settlement.
Was it a kibbutz that you were born on?
No, I was born in the city.
You must have felt some attachment to that kibbutz?
There was a lot of pain in experience in those days. People felt the need to contribute to the settlement of the country. People were very idealistic then. Not so much now.
You were there for three or four years?
I was there almost four years.
Then you went to the University?
Then I went to the Technion. I went to Technion and spent only one year there, and then came to this country.
How did that come about?
I just wanted to see the world.
Without an intention to immigrate?
No, not at all. I stayed here, and I got my first degree, my Bachelor’s Degree, at the University of Denver in Electrical Engineering.
How did you choose electrical engineering?
I thought it was a very interesting profession.
Some people were ham radio operators or had a father who was an engineer.
Actually I was studying music as a hobby in those days before I went to the University. Now that you ask me, actually the reason I chose engineering was because in high school we had a teacher who taught us physics and mathematics, and he was absolutely the most fantastic teacher I ever had.
What was his name? Do you remember? Sometimes with these inspirational teachers it is nice to give them the recognition they deserve.
His last name was Mr. Shamir. I do not remember his first name. He was very inspiring, and I really loved the subjects. Everybody who took classes with him felt the same way. He was a very unusual teacher. That is sort of what got me interested.
How did you end up at the University of Denver?
I had some distant family there. That is a sad story because the University of Denver closed its Engineering College about four, five, or six years after I graduated, then they reopened it about ten years ago.
How was your education at the University of Denver?
It was good. Some of the teachers were very good there, and some of them were not. It was not a high-powered research university, particularly not in engineering. From there I went to the University of Pennsylvania. While I was an undergraduate student I worked as an electronics technician at the Medical Center of the University of Colorado in Denver. I worked for a psychiatrist named Sidney Margolin, who was actually trained under Freud, and did what was called psychophysiology. He lived in New York for many years and treated some of the most famous movie stars as a psychiatrist, then he decided he had enough of the city life and moved to Denver to be on the faculty. He was an electronics nut. He had the first electronics system to measure psychological responses. Dr. Offner built it for him.
Do you know what sort of psychological responses?
Yes. ECG, EKG, galvanic response—any electrical response that is measured today, he had the first unit that did that. I maintained this unit for him. It was built with tubes and all done by hand.
That is interesting. Thelma Estrin got her start in the field by maintaining the ECG machine. This seems to be your entry into biomedical engineering, working on such a machine.
This was what got me interested. When I graduated with my Bachelor’s Degree, NIH just funded three universities that started biomedical engineering programs: Johns Hopkins, The University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Rochester. The program at Rochester was directed by one of Herman Schwan’s students, Ed Carstensen. Talbott was at Johns Hopkins, he also was one of the pioneers in biomedical engineering, but he died very young. I do not know if his name was ever mentioned, or if Schwan has ever mentioned him.
Yes, I know the name.
I found out that NIH funded those three training programs, so I applied to all three of them and was accepted at all three institutions with fellowship offers.
So how did you choose Pennsylvania?
I looked at what each university offered, and felt that the University of Pennsylvania would give me the best variety, the broadest possible education. Talbot, who ran Johns Hopkins program, was in charge of the student seminars at Penn. He came every two weeks to Pennsylvania and gave the most thought-provoking seminars that I ever experienced. Each student had to do a project, had to read papers. There was a lot of preparation for those seminars.
He was conducting this seminar at Penn on a regular basis?
Basically what he did was to assign us papers, and then he would write up a set of questions that we should think about while reading the papers. Then we would make presentations and have discussions at those seminars. It was very interesting. Some of the luminaries in the field were there. Schwan was there and David Geselowitz was there, and some other people who are no longer there.
Jack Reid may have been there when you were there?
Yes. Jack Reid was a student back then. I hired Jack Reid when I was director of the Institute at Drexel. I finished my Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania.
What was your thesis work?
My thesis was on cardiac pacemaker electrodes.
What years were you a graduate student?
Before I went to the University of Pennsylvania, I received a special fellowship to the University of Colorado Medical School—not as a medical student but to the graduate school. I studied biophysics and biochemistry there for one year.
Was that a degree program or just course work?
Just course work. I just felt I needed some biological background before I went into biomedical engineering.
Your undergraduate Bachelor’s of Engineering was strictly general?
Strictly general.
But you got interested in biomedical applications.
Because I was an electronics technician, I felt that I needed a year of extra training, which I did. Then I applied to those universities.
So it does not surprise me then to hear that you were accepted at all three places because you had the engineering degree plus training.
Plus I graduated with honors with my Bachelor’s degree. I think that is why I was accepted at all the institutions.
What years were you were a graduate?
I got my Ph.D. in 1967.
This was very early for pacemakers.
Very early for pacemakers. The electronics was fairly straightforward; not necessarily miniaturized the way it is right now. It was a fixed rate pacemaker.
Were these implantable pacemakers you were working on?
Yes. What people did not know was the reaction of the electrodes with tissues and how that affects the pacemakers.
Were you concerned with the long-term interaction of tissue and electrodes?
Yes, that is right. But I was looking basically at the electrical properties of the interface between pacemakers and the electrodes.
The physics of what is going on with the tissue and electrodes?
Exactly. Actually Banu Onaral continued some of that work, but she worked on electrodes in general, not necessarily pacemaker electrodes. She was looking at lower frequency responses. I was looking at higher frequency properties of the interface.
How did you study that interface? Did you have some system?
I studied using frequency domain and time domain studies.
With what tissue? How did you actually get measurement?
I did bench and theoretical studies, then I did patient studies.
What kind of tissue was available for the bench studies?
Just saline for the bench studies. I do not remember whether I did any actual tissue studies. I do not think we did. That would have been fairly complicated, short of using animals. We did not have animal facilities in the department. We would have had to go to the vet school. We just went directly to patients and I studied them.
You developed a theoretical explanation of what is going on, and then measured this in the lab and with patients?
Yes, precisely.
How do you feel, looking back on that work?
It was better work than many of my students are doing these days. I think the quality of the work that is done right now in graduate school is somewhat lower than it used to be.
Did you work closely with Schwan?
Yes. I worked basically with three people. I worked with Schwan, David Geselowitz and I worked with a cardiologist by the name of Stanley Brilles.
Jack Reid mentioned a cardiologist.
No, he mentioned somebody else.
Claude Joyner?
No, not Claude Joyner. The reason Geselowitz was interested is because Geselowitz did a lot of modeling of the heart as an electrical generator, and trying to figure out the electrical properties of the heart from surface potentials.
You mean the surface of the body?
Yes, from measurement on the surface of the body. If you have a generator inside the body, it generates potentials on the surface. You can measure the potential on the surface of the body. The question is, from the surface of the body, can you deduce what happens to the generator representing the heart. That is done to a certain extent with electrocardiography—that is what electrocardiography is all about. But electrocardiography has serious limitations. He was trying to figure out whether there is a better way of getting more information about the generator. With a pacemaker, we knew exactly the properties of those generators. We knew exactly what the current of the pacemaker is, what the voltage is, so we tried to measure surface potentials and relate those surface potentials to the pacemaker as a generator.
That sounds like a completely different problem from the electrodes.
Yes. I worked on both.
I see. But your thesis was the electrodes?
I wrote up both projects.
Both. How self-directed was this work? Were you deciding what problems to attack?
The general problem was given to me, but the approach was pretty much self-directed. It was my own approach.
Nebeker:
Were your results much noticed?
Yes, in regular written literature. That was a long time ago. There have been many other advances since then.
Nebeker:
I remember being told how important it was to understand electrodes in these systems. I’m sure those results were valuable.
Yes.
You got your Ph.D. in 1967. What did you do then?
I then went to work with a heart surgeon by the name of Adrian Kantrowitz at Intra-aortic balloon pump development, Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. The reason I went to work with him was that he had just received a very large grant from the NIH to build and test heart assist devices. The pacemaker is an electrical generator, not a heart assist device. A heart assist device is a mechanical device. Together we developed the intra-aortic balloon pump. The intra-aortic balloon pump is a plastic balloon, maybe 20 centimeters long, mounted at the end of a hollow catheter, which is introduced through the femoral artery all the way through the descending thoracic aorta. That is the vessel where all the blood is pumped from the left ventricle. The balloon is inflated and deflated in synchrony with the heart. When the heart begins to pump blood, to eject blood, you deflate the balloon, thereby creating a lower lobe low resistance, making it easier for the heart to pump the blood. When the ejection period of the heart is finished and the aortic valve closes, the balloon is inflated, which displaces the blood to the periphery, but more importantly towards the heart. The coronary vessels get all their blood supply during the time when the heart is relaxed, which is the time that the balloon is inflating. You are prefusing the heart itself as well as the periphery. What you are achieving by that is increasing the blood supply to the heart, which in the case of a heart attack is a problem; and also increasing the blood supply to the periphery; and reducing the workload on the heart, making it easier for the heart to recover.
This is for people with weak hearts for some reason?
Yes, after a severe heart attack. Or people who cannot come off the heart-lung oxygenator, used during surgery, to improve circulation. This is now used clinically throughout the world.
It seems like an auxiliary heart that is pumping.
That is exactly what it is. It is like an auxiliary heart. It is like a third chamber. The way you synchronize it to the heart is you pick up the electrocardiogram and use it to time the balloon. With every heartbeat, when the heart pumps the balloon is inflated and when the heart relaxes the balloon is deflated.
With the cardiac surgeon that you were working with, your job was the electronics of the synchronizing?
I had a theory to get the optimized effects from the balloon. I did a lot of simulation.
I see, of exactly how and when you would inflate.
That’s right. And how much. So I had to study the cardiovascular system.
Did you actually make a mathematical model of what was going on?
I sure did, absolutely.
Was this before the days when you would simulate on the computer?
No, we used a computer. It was just a different computer—a much slower computer.
Maybe with punched cards or something like that.
Actually it was. I am trying to remember the first machine we had. I remember we bought a PDP-15, DEC PDP-15. It was the machine that came after the PDP-9, and it did not last very long. It was not a very good machine.
I think it was in the mid ‘60s that the first of the mini computers came out.
Right, the Link 8.
That made a big difference to a lot of the scientists and engineers. For the first time they could have their own computer.
The PDP-15 was not a personal computer. It occupied a room this big.
Right. But still in the laboratory as opposed to the mainframe that the university would have.
That’s right.
How long did you work with Kontrowitz?
I worked with him from 1967 until the end of 1972. In 1970 we moved the whole laboratory to Detroit.
Why was that?
He was not getting the support he needed where he was. The hospital was not really research oriented enough. We moved the whole thing to the Sinai Hospital in Detroit. I was in Detroit for three years.
Had anything like the intra-aortic balloon been done before?
No.
This was completely new?
Actually, the concept was first proposed by a man named Mollopolus. He was not in Greece at that time; he was doing work in the United States. He didn’t really develop it. It is interesting, because Kantrowitz has a brother by the name of Arthur Kantrowitz, who is a very famous physicist. He worked at AVCO at the time. They had both been discussing the idea, and he had tried to develop the same device through AVCO. Adrian Kontrowitz, whom I worked for, developed it in his own laboratory. Adrian Kontrowitz did the first test on patients.
You worked with him in actually building this device?
That is right, exactly. We actually made the balloons. We made everything, tested it on animals extensively, and then used it on patients.
How did this development process go? How did it go when you first tested it in animals? Did it work initially?
It worked from the beginning. The theory behind it was very sound. We just had to make sure that it was as effective as we wanted it to be. We were concerned about any interactions with the blood.
Also, it sounds like a very difficult placement.
No, it was not very difficult.
There is quite a distance there between where you are inserting it and where it is residing, right?
You have a catheter that is carrying the airflow to inflate the balloons?
Helium. Because we had to move the gas flow very fast, so we had to use the lowest density gas as possible, so we used helium. The problem with animals was that at first we started using normal animals. When you have a normal heart, it is not very effective. We realized that the heart had to be in failure. We induced failure in the animals, and that is when it started being effective.
Do you remember the first human trial?
I do remember the first human trials because I spent a lot of nights at the hospital.
Were there major problems initially?
The real problem was the control unit that we used was basically an oscilloscope. We had to synchronize the valves, which controlled the inflation and deflation cycles using an oscilloscope. Everything was very big and all custom made.
Was it hand-synchronization?
No. We picked up the signal on the oscilloscope, and then we synchronized the balloon from output of the oscilloscope.
Are you turning the dials or is somebody turning the dials?
We had to turn dials to time it correctly, absolutely.
It was not an automatic system picking it up?
No, even now it is not automatic. It is much more sophisticated now, but it is not completely automatic. If you have a regular heartbeat, it is fine. But those patients do not have a regular heartbeat.
It takes an eye to see where you should…
That is right. One of the problems was to try and find a way so that it can operate automatically, so you do not need the human intervention. If you inflate a balloon while the aortic valve is too open, that actually could do much more damage because now you are all of a sudden increasing the load immensely on the heart.
Was it possible to detect the opening and closing of that valve?
Only through the EKG.
What year was this that you were first using the device?
It was 1968. We had done maybe five or six or seven patients, and the word began to spread around and people started calling us. We got a call from the family of President Eisenhower to come with our device because he was hospitalized with a bad heart. His physician vetoed it; he did not want us to come. In an even more interesting instance, a physician on a trip to Sicily was hospitalized with a heart attack there, and he was deteriorating very quickly. His son, who was also a physician, knew of our work, and he called us and asked us to fly over to Sicily with our equipment and assist the heart. That was over Memorial weekend or something like that. At that time I did not have my American citizenship yet; I just did not see any reason to get it. What we did was to organize basically a small hospital and ship it to Sicily. I pulled out my Israeli passport and realized it had expired. So on Memorial Day, I flew to Chicago and I knocked on the door of the Embassy in the middle of a holiday and told them what was happening, and they renewed my passport. I flew back to Detroit and we packed everything. The son had a lot of influence with the Air Force, so he had the Air Force fly compressed helium to Sicily by special jet. We got on a plane in Detroit and flew to New York where he was meeting us and was taking us from there to Italy.
Were you traveling with your equipment?
We were traveling with our equipment. I was the engineer and Kantrowitz was the physician. The son met us in New York, and he said, “You know something, my father is improving. So I am going to save the money.” So we turned around and flew back to Detroit. When we landed in Detroit, we got a telephone call that his father had died. It may have been a day later. Had we been there, we might have been able to save him.
How did the technique then spread? Did some company take up manufacturing?
That is right.
Were you involved in that?
Actually, we tried to commercialize it through one company, and that company failed miserably in marketing it. There was another competitor who picked it up. The company that is selling most of the balloons right now is called Datascope in New Jersey.
Did you and Kantrowitz have patents on it?
We had patents, but it is very easy to get around a patent.
Did several companies develop it once it had been shown that this was an effective technique?
Several companies tried. Then various other companies bought them. It was sort of a chain reaction. But Datascope is really the major manufacturer of intra-aortic balloon pumps.
This is widely used now?
Widely used, yes. Almost every hospital now has it.
It must have been gratifying right out of your Ph.D. to do very important work like that.
It was very gratifying. I moved to Detroit in 1971 and then left in 1973. I went to the University of Rhode Island. I felt that I really wanted to go back to academia. I went to the University of Rhode Island where I joined the Electrical Engineering Department there.
Did they have a program in biomedical engineering?
They did not. I started the program. Basically they brought me in to start a program there that was an option of the electrical engineering program. They do not have a medical school there, so I started collaborating with medical schools and hospitals. The program started growing very substantially. I continued my research. I still worked together with Kantrowitz while I was there doing some simulation work.
Still on the intra-aortic pump?
Yes. I was sort of switching my work, changing gradually to look at the cardiovascular system in general, trying to simulate the cardiovascular system, looking at how it functions in normal state and in disease.
Sort of an engineering model of the cardiovascular system?
Yes. That is right. How blood flows and how the vessels react. I spent seven years there at the University of Rhode Island.
Were there other faculty members who got into biomedical engineering?
Yes. We brought some faculty members in, and there were other faculty members there. The university was very supportive for a long time.
You got quite a few students?
Yes, I had quite a few students.
Your work in this period was the cardiovascular system?
Yes that is right, and has remained that way pretty much.
How do you go about that work? Is it largely theoretical?
A lot of it is theoretical, and it was combined with animal experiments. I worked with Rhode Island Hospital, where we did tests on animals.
Did you get some mathematical model that would allow you to predict what would happen under certain conditions?
Yes. We studied the various properties, but you cannot really study in a living system because of so many variables. If you can validate the model under certain conditions, you have the expectations that it would also work under other conditions, but you cannot really duplicate them in the laboratory. So you could predict various properties of the system.
You were trying to model healthy systems?
Healthy systems at the beginning, and then later on I started simulations. I am still working on that. This is not something that you do in a day or a year.
Right. Is this something that was developed into some standard piece of software, some simulation package that others could look at?
I have quite a few simulation packages, and other people have used it. I will tell you in a second about it. I left the University of Rhode Island because I was offered to direct the Biomedical and Engineering and Science Institute, and I have been there since 1980. So I left the University of Rhode Island and I moved to Philadelphia and started working at Drexel University. I built up a very strong educational program there.
What was at Drexel before you arrived?
Drexel had an institute before I arrived, and they had one of the earliest biomedical engineering programs in the country. It started in 1958 with a grant from the NIH. The purpose of that program was to take physicians and convert them into engineers. If I remember correctly, the first one was Dr. Dowd. It was not very successful because it is very difficult to take somebody who was not brought up in the engineering culture and try to get the person to think in that way. It really did not continue for very long as that kind of a program. It sort of limped along until 1980 when I came, and I really rebuilt that program.
They had a couple of faculty members in biomedical engineering?
Until the early ‘70s, it was an option in electrical engineering. It was actually a program initially; it was not an institute. Then it was established as an interdisciplinary institute. I am not exactly sure what year that happened but it was sometime in the early ‘70s. Hun Sun was director of the program for a while, then Dick Beard was director for just a couple of years. Then it sort of went without a head for a couple of years until they recruited me.
There were a couple of people on the faculty in that area when you arrived?
Yes, on the faculty of electrical engineering.
So the institute was within the Electrical Engineering Department?
The program sort of followed Electrical Engineering, then it became an interdisciplinary institute and it was moved above or out of the Electrical Engineering Department and added other faculty members who were interested in it. Although there were really almost no other faculty members that participated in the teaching program, except from Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. When I came I started recruiting more faculty members. We did not have our own tenure slots. I was the only person who was appointed full time, but my tenure still resided in Electrical Engineering. We had a dozen or so faculty members who had either taught a little bit in the program or had some research interests in the program. I started building the graduate program. We did not have any undergraduate program. Within a fairly short time, maybe six or seven years, the number of our graduate students rose from the teens to about 120. The research funding that we were getting when I came was like $200,000 or $300,000 total for the institute, and we built it up to about two or three million dollars a year. It went very, very well.
How long did you direct the institute?
In 1991 I decided I needed a sabbatical, and I went to the National Science Foundation for two years on leave. One of the first things that I did when I became director was hire two professors. We received a very large endowment called The Calhoun Endowment, named after Ernest Calhoun, that allowed us to hire one individual, and that was Jack Reid. I brought Jack Reid to the Institute. When we were searching for the individual, we came up with two final candidates, both of them were very good: Jack Reid and Vernon Newhouse. We went to the president and asked what should we do. The president said, “Bring them both aboard.” He came up with a named position for Vernon Newhouse, and Jack Reid became the Calhoun professor. After eleven years as director, in 1991 I went to the National Science Foundation, where I was the Director of the Division of Biological and Critical Systems in the Engineering Directorate. Jack Reid became the Acting Director while I was away.
At NSF were you a program officer overseeing grants?
Division Director. I had ten programs under me. I was Division Director, not a program officer. Some of the programs that were under my direction were the Biomedical Engineering program, technology program, Biochemical Engineering program, Research to Aid Persons with Disability program, and I also had the Earthquake Engineering Research programs and the Environmental programs. Before I left, I convinced the Assistant Director for Engineering to create a new division, which became the Bioengineering in Environmental Systems, and all the earthquake programs moved to another division, because I just did not see how those were related to the rest of the division.
Why did you want such a job? It sounds like full time administration.
It was.
You were a researcher?
I was both a researcher and an administrator.
I guess you had become more of an administrator at Drexel?
Yes, I did a lot of administration at Drexel. It was a major responsibility to manage the Institute. I just wanted to have some reprieve from the Drexel environment for a while, and I found it very, very interesting. It was very rewarding and I learned a great deal. I did a lot of good, too, at NSF. I had a lot of accomplishments there, not the least of them was to change the division which became Bioengineering and Environmental Systems, elevating bioengineering and making it much better known within the NSF.
I returned to Drexel in 1993 as head of the Institute again. Four years later, in 1996, I decided I needed another sabbatical, so I went on leave to the NIH. At the NIH I was in charge of the Biomedical Technology program at the National Center for Research Resources and Associate Director of the Center.
Is this a very similar job to the NSF one?
No, it was quite different. It was also administrative.
You are administering grants, is that right?
No. I was managing the overall program.
You were managing the research at NIH ?
No, I did not do any research. Neither did I do any research at NSF. But at NIH, I also had people working for me who managed the grants that they awarded. It was similar in the terms of the responsibilities, but in terms of funding the program was five times as large as the NSF program. When I was Division Director at NSF, my whole division had maybe $40 or $45 million, but the Biomedical Engineering part of it had only like $20 million. At NIH, I was in charge of over $100 million, which was a lot more.
And that is biomedical engineering?
It was called biomedical technology, but a lot of what we funded was biomedical engineering.
Give me some sense of where the funding is coming from in biomedical engineering generally. NIH must be one of the main players in this. NSF…
NSF is a very small player in biomedical engineering. The total funding of biomedical engineering by NSF is probably on the order of $25 million today.
And NIH today?
NIH is very, very difficult to estimate. As a matter of fact, a study was done before I came there and we did another study again. If you take the definition of NIH for biomedical engineering, then NIH funded biomedical engineering research to the tune of about $400 million, roughly. But that may be a little bit exaggerated because of the way they count the money and the way they define what is biomedical engineering. Maybe if we could cut it by about 40% or so, I think a better figure may be about $250 to $300 million.
Is there any estimate of how much industry is putting into biomedical engineering?
That is very, very difficult to estimate.
What about the Whitaker Foundation?
The Whitaker Foundation is putting in a lot of money.
Any estimate of how much?
I think this year they are talking about making grants in the amount of $60 or $70 million. That is a lot of money.
I am just trying to get some rough idea. Are there any other major players or funders in biomedical engineering?
There are some other foundations that have funded a little bit. The Kellogg Foundation funded some biomedical engineering from time to time.
There is certainly a good deal of university support for all these faculty positions. But the research typically is funded from outside.
Right. I suppose there are some hospitals that have funded biomedical engineering from the in clinical income, but this is diminishing because of the reimbursement system. The hospitals are pressed to make ends meet as it is, let alone to fund additional research.
Were you living in Washington or that area?
I commuted. I came back to Philadelphia on weekends. I had an apartment in Washington.
How long did you work at NIH?
A little over two years. Again, I had some very major accomplishments, not the least one of them was to put together a major conference in biomedical engineering that really, I think, changed NIH’s view of biomedical engineering. Most of the people at NIH had never thought of biomedical engineering as a serious contributor to basic research in biology and medicine. They look at biomedical engineering sort of as a service profession—you tell biomedical engineering what you want to build and they build it for you. I think that having that major symposium in 1998 was really a major step for NIH.
Was that in the Washington area?
It was in Bethesda.
Did you bring in top people from around the world?
Top people. Some were from around the world but mostly from the United States. We ran all kinds of special sessions.
To interest other people at NIH in this work?
To interest other people at NIH, and to make recommendations to NIH as to what needs to be done. As a result, NIH started looking at how applications are reviewed at NIH, and the fact that it is really difficult for biomedical engineering applications to get funded. They are changing that now, which is a very major change.
Of course, there is now legislation on the Hill to start a new institute. I do not think that legislation will make it, but this is the second year now in a row, and there is much more support in Congress for it right now.
An institute for biomedical engineering?
It is called the Institute for Bioimaging and Bioengineering. The previous year there were two bills in Congress, one for an imaging institute and the other one for a biomedical engineering center.
Did you advocate that there would be such an institute when you were at NIH?
Working for the government, you are not allowed to advocate anything like that. It is illegal. Once you are out of the government, you can advocate all you want. I was opposed to the Center because I think the Center is really not going to do very much. The way the name of the institute is being proposed is flawed because imaging is really part of biomedical engineering. The reason it was done that way is because imaging research has been advocated by the radiology community. The radiology community feels that they are not getting their fair share of grant support, and they are very, very strong and have a lot of money. Bioengineers are not very rich, so they do not have the same lobbying power that radiologists do. So the two committees agreed at least for a compromise, which generated much more support in Congress, but I still do not think it is going to fly because Varmus is opposed to this. But of course, Varmus is leaving NIH at the end of the year, so that may change things all together - who knows.
Radiology is a well-established branch of medicine, and as you say, very large. What have been the relations between the two fields of radiology and biomedical engineering, academically and otherwise? Professionally are they completely separate?
I can tell you that you work very closely with radiology departments. It depends. In many institutions there is a close synergy between biomedical engineering and radiology—the two communities work very closely together and they benefit from each other. In some institutions that is not the case at all. You cannot make any generalizations.
Radiology goes back to the turn of the century.
You have to think of it in terms of those who do research in radiology and those who just provide clinical service. The ones who just provide clinical service do not care where all the innovations come from, they do not care who thought of those ideas, they don’t care who first proposed the MRI or developed ultrasound, etc. This is all done by biomedical engineers. But as a clinician, you use the equipment and that is it. As a researcher, if you want to make advances in the field, you have to work together with engineers.
Have the people who have been making advances in radiology technique been members of the IEEE EMBS for example?
Some of them, but not all of them. Ever since I was president of the EMBS I have pointed out the very serious problem that the EMBS focuses only on those professionals whose roots are in electrical engineering. Biomedical engineering has become much more than electrical engineering oriented. As a matter of fact, the majority of biomedical engineers right now do not even know what an electrical engineering circuit is, probably. There are many more mechanical, chemical, information, computer, materials… I predicted it ever since I became president of the society, and I have urged the society to move more and more in that direction. But it is very difficult to do. I think that there is some attempt to do something along these lines, but I just do not know how successful it is.
It seems some of these areas like radiology, maybe ultrasound is another example, are so large that it is a little bit hard to keep those professionals in a more general society like the EMBS, when there are plenty of people in that more specific field to fill journals and conferences and so on.
Since you are talking about radiology, The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) has probably 60,000 or 70,000 members, maybe not quite that many, but that is certainly the order of magnitude of participants in the RSNA meeting which takes place in Chicago every year. Within radiology, some of them specialize in ultrasound, some of them specialize in MRI. The ultrasound people have their own Society and the MRI have their own. But they all come to the RSNA meeting because that is where they see all the new things that are happening. I do not know why it is, but in general in engineering you do not see that. People look at their very narrow area and do not try to look at the bigger picture.
I suppose that people who are in one type of imaging are more likely to be interested in other types of medical imaging, and therefore would be interested in going to a radiology conference that presents these different types. Whereas, biomedical engineering in general is so diverse that it may be difficult to attract people who do not care at all about prosthesis or wheelchairs, or these very different areas
I do not know; it is hard to say. I know radiologists who use only imaging technique. They converge on that one meeting even though at that meeting they will go into sessions in their particular imaging area. The meeting is so global and is so broad in nature that people want to come there.
I suppose the rationale for having a society with a broader range is that the techniques can be transferred to some extent. There is some benefit to being a member, and seeing that in cardiology they are using ultrasound for this or they are using this sensor for that and maybe we can do a similar thing in neurology. A rationale is that there is transfer of techniques, and if you are an electrical engineer you can see how in this other area of biomedicine techniques are being used, and maybe that can be transferred into something that you are interested in.
I think that the same thing is true in engineering. You can listen to talks which are not necessarily in your area and get ideas that may be applicable to your own area.
Right, so that is the rationale for having a large meeting.
Sure it is a rationale.
As someone who has been president of EMBS, you must feel that there are things to be gained from being a member of a more general society rather than a very narrow specialty.
Yes. I think that you learn a great deal from what other people do and you come up with ideas you never thought could be applicable to your own specialty.
We are well into the 1990s because we talked about your NIH tenure. And then you returned to Drexel after that. Are you head of the institute?
No. Banu Onoral is now. The Institute was converted into a school. The Institute was called the Biomedical Engineering and Science Institute, and the new school is called The School of Biomedical Engineering, Science, and Health Systems. Calhoun distinguished professor of engineering and medicine, so I am a professor now.
Are you still doing research in cardiovascular science?
Yes, I am beginning to build up my research again. When I was with NIH I was able to do very little research. I had my last Ph.D. student finish just when I came back. During the years, in addition to looking at the cardiovascular system I did some research on cardiovascular responses to acceleration stress—G stress with pilots. I was working on developing a special protective suit that would give pilots more protection than the standard G suit that exists today. I have been expanding my research to look at gas transport in the recirculation and to integrate this information with my hemodynamic model.
Where is the gas?
In the microcirculation. This is all done by simulation, modeling, and comparison with experiments.
Is NASA or the Air Force interested in that?
The Navy funded it. The Navy has more airplanes that the Air Force. I did not know that until I started getting funding from them.
Any comments you care to make about biomedical engineering in general in this country?
Biomedical engineering in general is changing very rapidly and dramatically. It started as an extension of electrical engineering, but that is no longer the case. It is a discipline that has grown and has matured. It includes areas which relate to chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and materials, and now it is looking not only at the overall system but more and more at the micro level and how to integrate the knowledge that we find at the micro level to the properties of the entire system. In the past we were looking just at what we could measure in a very gross fashion and try to understand it from that point of view. Right now we are looking at the molecular and cellular levels and trying to understand the whole system based on what is happening at these levels.
There are also the new capabilities of acting at that level using implantable devices and microelectronics.
Correct. We are entering a new era. When we finish sequencing the genome, we will begin to understand how the genes relate to proteins and how they relate to cell function, how the cells behave, how tissues behave, and finally how whole organs and the organism behaves. I think the only people that will really be able to piece that picture together are biomedical engineers. The way scientists study something is by what is called the reductionist approach. They break a system down into its smallest components and concentrate on the very small components. Engineers try to integrate. Biomedical engineers who understand the living system should be able to integrate all those functions and begin to understand how the whole system works.
Right. The engineer is typically concerned with an overall performance and how that is achieved.
Up to now we did not know how the components behaved. We are now beginning to understand how some of the components of the system behave. Knowing how the components behave is not necessarily going to tell you how the whole system behaves because of nonlinearities, because of chaos, because of other factors that enter into play. Scientists, biologists, or chemists, or what have you, are not really trained to be able to put all of those components together into a coherent system.
What is the prospect right now in your own area of cardiovascular modeling of getting a satisfactory model of it that works under a wide range of conditions?
The prospects are very good. There are some people who are actually now putting together a mechanical and electrical model of the heart, and they are able to explain a great deal and predict behavior, and then suggest drug therapy.
These models actually incorporate how chemical effects occur?
That is right, exactly.
In the history of physics, there have been certain areas where physics adequately explained what was going on. One could take billiard balls or something like that and predict if you have a ball moving at this speed and this arrangement what is going to happen. Do you think that with cardiovascular modeling we are getting close to that kind of understanding?
At a certain level. But I think that in order to make sense of all the information that we are gaining right now from biological research, we will have to have much more extensive modeling and simulation.
It is the integration of all these many components and effects and so on in a very complex system that the engineers are particularly good at.
Precisely. I think that is where the engineering is going to play an even more important role than it has played in the past.
Anything else that you would care to comment on?
I had lots of things to say, but I am sort of running out of steam.
Thank you for the interview.
<|endofexample|>
This interview covers Wheeler’s entire career. Wheeler received his BS in Physics from George Washington University in 1925, then spent three years at the graduate Physics department at Johns Hopkins. He joined the Hazeltine Corporation as a part-time employee in 1923 (Prof. Hazeltine’s first employee), full-time from 1928. His first assignment was to design test equipment, and he became head of Hazeltine’s Bayside Laboratory in 1930. He began to work on automatic volume control for radio receivers in 1925, with patent issued in 1932. In 1936 he stepped down from management of Bayside and began television research. He left Hazeltine in 1946 and started his own independent research laboratory, Wheeler Laboratories, in 1947. Wheeler Labs often worked as a sub-contractor for Bell Labs. At Wheeler Laboratories he initiated the Wheeler Monographs series. Hazeltine acquired Wheeler Laboratories about 1959, but it remained autonomous for another decade. Wheeler rose to become chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Hazeltine in the 1960s, but reluctantly, since he felt no vocation for management. His main achievements were morale boosting: installing air conditioning (!) and setting up a defined-contribution pension plan. He remained as chairman of the board of directors until 1977, and as chief scientist at Hazeltine until 1987.
Hazeltine Co. spent the 1920s and 1930s working on various aspects of radio and TV technology. The corporate culture fostered cooperation, and encouraged research even when it wasn’t immediately profitable. Employees largely had (engineering) undergraduate degrees; PhDs were fairly rare. In the 1920s radio science was primitive, and a PhD of little value; but during the 1930s the value of a PhD rapidly increased as the scientific basis of radio work improved. Wheeler now credits some of his early success to his then-unusual level of graduate training, and thinks he might have benefited by sticking around to receive a PhD. Engineers at Hazeltine could publish their results earlier than most of their peers, and get more public recognition, since Hazeltine got its money more by licensing technology than by producing hardware itself. From 1965 to 1971 a series of egregious judicial decisions relating to television patents, Zenith vs. Hazeltine, almost bankrupted Hazeltine.
During this period Hazeltine Co. received considerable revenue by licensing its radio receiver patents to various manufacturers. During and after World War II this revenue source dwindled, partly due to several court decisions invalidating and/or restricting its radio patents, Detrola vs. Hazeltine, and Hazeltine switched to manufacturing military equipment as its main source of revenue. During World War II Hazeltine worked to develop a mine-detector, then worked on Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems. After the war it worked on a wide variety of military technology.
Wheeler is proudest of his invention of automatic volume control for radio receivers. Other inventions of note include the neutralized TRF amplifier, the amplifier for heart-action currents, the piston attenuator, the VTVM operating half-wave square-law, all-wave antenna circuits, and a vertical antenna made of transposed sections of coaxial cable. He also did research on level amplification of circuits, maximum flat bandwidth attainable in an amplifier with shunt capacitance, the skin effect, the fundamental limitations of small antennas, the use of Maxwell’s spherical coil as an inductor shield or antenna, radio propagation in the earth’s crust, the logical date code, designing a radar array as an element of an infinite array, phased arrays, and surface-to-air missiles. Wheeler enjoyed figuring out simple formulas for engineering questions; e.g., computing the inductance of a conductor, formulas for strip lines, transmission-line impedance curves. His research after the war focused on antennas, microwaves, and strip lines.
Some miscellaneous items: Wheeler talks about the need for design handbooks, and their appearance in the field. Related to handbooks, he makes reference to Fred Terman’s textbook, and his friendship with Terman. He talks about the value of laboratory notebooks. He also talks about the differences between and the growing closeness of engineering and physics. He mentions his involvement with the IRE from 1926, including service on the board of directors from 1940 to 1945, on the Radio Receivers Standards Committee, and on the Board of Editors for many year. He talks about the effect of grants, positive and negative, on technological innovation. He talks about various famous engineers, scientists, and inventors he has known.

Nebeker:
Could you briefly describe your background and education?
Wheeler:
I was born in St. Paul MN on May 10th, 1903, so I am now 88. After a couple of years in Brookings, SD, we moved to Mitchell, SD when I was four. In 1916, when I was thirteen, we moved to Washington DC, where I attended the new Central High School and then George Washington University. In 1925 I graduated with the degree of B.S. in physics, the first to receive that degree. The next three years, I studied in the physics department of Johns Hopkins University in nearby Baltimore MD. In 1926 I married Ruth Gregory.
What were your first jobs?
In the summers of 1921 and '22 I worked as laboratory assistant in the Radio Laboratory of the Bureau of Standards, near my home. Then I met Professor Hazeltine, the head of the EE department at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken NJ, across the river from New York City. The following summer I worked in his laboratory.
Then Hazeltine Corporation was organized on February 1st, 1924, to manage the professor's patents on a neutralized tuned RF amplifier. It was named the "Neutrodyne" and captured the high quality market of broadcast receivers in 1923. The company started a laboratory in the attic above the professor's office. I was the first employee — part-time while I continued college. From the summer of 1928 I was employed full-time. In 1929 the laboratory expanded on the top floor of a loft building on West 52nd Street in New York City. In 1930 a second laboratory was located in Bayside on Long Island, and I was put in charge. In 1939 the Bayside Laboratory was superseded by the Little Neck Laboratory located in a new building nearby on Long Island. Where were the principal developments before World War II. They are covered in my book, The early days of Wheeler and Hazeltine Corporation.
As you look back on a long career, what are proudest of?
If I were to select one accomplishment that stands out in my career, it would have to be the invention of the automatic volume control for radio receivers, that we came to call "diode AVC." It was the subject of the eighteenth of my 180 U.S. Patents, number 1879863, issued September 27, 1932. It was later revised and reissued as number Re. 19744 on October 29, 1935. The latter was declared invalid for want of invention by the U.S. Supreme Court on May 12, 1941. My views on that decision will be the subject of some later comments.
In the summer of 1925, just after graduating from George Washington University in Washington DC, I went to work a third summer in the Hazeltine corporation laboratory. It was located in a few rooms in the attic of the Electrical Engineering building of Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken NJ, across the Hudson River from New York City.
I was impressed with the amount of RF amplification in the latest designs of tunable receivers for radio broadcasting. Connected with an outdoor wire antenna, the sound level on local stations was so great that a "volume control" was needed to reduce the sound to a level suitable for listening. There were two tuning dials for antenna circuit and RF amplifier so a "third hand" was needed for the volume control. I perceived that an automatic control was needed to set the sound volume at a desired level for all stations. Then the volume control knob could be set once for all stations within range. I soon decided that the automatic control should be applied to the RF amplifier ahead of the detector and AF amplifier. I aimed to do that by developing from the detector a bias voltage sufficient to control the gain in the RF amplifier if applied to the control grid of one or more of the RF amplifier tubes.
It was customary to operate the detector with a rather small signal voltage because it was difficult to design a large amplification ahead of the detector in the TRF amplifier. I investigated various circuits for amplifying the small rectified voltage in the detector, but these circuits were complicated and required critical adjustments.
In the fall of 1925, I entered the graduate school in Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, near my home in Washington. I planned to make a receiver with automatic volume control, during the Christmas holidays, in my basement laboratory at my home. I decided on a super heterodyne circuit to obtain sufficient RF amplification ahead of the detector. It was my first because that type of receiver was not in common use outside RCA (they refused to license its use by other companies). My design was an advance over others because I used a neutralized intermediate-frequency (IF) amplifier at a frequency only slightly below the broadcast band (550-1600 MC). This was a preview of later practice when the super heterodyne went into universal use a few years later, in 1930.
I built this receiver on a worktable. It was later preserved for exhibit in litigation so a photograph is available. It is now preserved in a showcase at the Hazeltine Corporation headquarter in Greenlawn on Long Island NY. It incorporated a modular design on eight small wooden bases. I had accumulated the necessary parts before the holidays. There were tunable circuits for the antenna, local oscillator, and four IF circuits. The construction of the receiver took only a few days and its operation was spectacular.
Then I approached the problem of obtaining from the detector a bias voltage for automatically controlling the amplification in the first one or two of the IF stages. I had entered in my notebook some rather complicated circuits using the usual triode detector. One problem I recall was the unavailability of resistors of values intermediate between wire-wound (up to 1000 ohms) and graphite "grid leaks" (around 1 mega-ohm). I needed some around 10-100 kilo-ohms. Also, those circuits required a floating "B battery" in addition to the common grounded B battery for all amplifier stages. For a few days, I was making little progress.
Then it occurred to me that I had enough amplification to use a diode rectifier as the detector, operating at 10 volts of IF signal. The diode would be made of the available triode with grid and plate connected together. This was heresy, to sacrifice the gain of one triode, costing about $5 apiece (about $100 in today's currency). However, the greater RF (IF) gain made up for the customary gain in a triode detector, so I still needed only two audio (AF) stages to drive the loud speaker. I quickly connected the diode with resistors and capacitors to provide separately the audio (AF) signal voltage and the bias (DC) voltage for control of the first one or two IF stages. I got around to entering the theory of these connections in my notebook a few days later (January 2, 1926). This was the date we established later for "reduction to practice".
The next day (January 3rd) was Sunday, when we had a party at my home. Among the guests were three of my Hopkins classmates (who later became famous in the fields of radio and electricity). I took them to my basement laboratory to see a demonstration of my receiver with automatic volume control. They witnessed this page of my notebook, which was later accepted as my date of disclosure of this invention.
This receiver had no manual volume control. The circuits were designed to provide nearly the entire available power to the loudspeaker, which in that day was a comfortable loudness. Gradually I appreciated that this diode detector was an efficient peak detector, which faithfully delivered the modulation envelope of the signal. This linear detector proved to be a great advance over the weak-signal "square-law" detector. It enabled the transmitters to use complete modulation. Previously the high-quality stations had been restricted to about 50 percent modulation to avoid excessive distortion in the square-low detector.
To this day, we have not learned of anyone else who independently devised this circuit for a radio receiver, either before or after my demonstration.
When did diode AVC appear on the market?
It was slow to be adopted because the prevalent TRF receivers did not have enough amplification to drive that circuit. In the summer of 1927, I was invited by Howard Radio Company in Chicago (one of our licensees) to visit their plant and build an elaborate receiver using diode AVC. I designed a receiver with four stages of uni-control TRF amplifier, requiring neutralization and elaborate shielding. Its performance was spectacular with a loop antenna.
You soon published a paper on AVC.
Yes, in the fall of 1927, I prepared a brief paper for the IRE, presenting diode AVC and referring in general terms to the Howard receiver. The circumstances of its publication are remarkable in contrast with the delays, which became common in later years. The paper was brief, with only four simple figures. Here is the sequence of events:
September 22: I called on Bob Marriott, the secretary of IRE, at his office in NYC, and described the subject that I would like to submit for publication. He liked the subject and said he would schedule it for the November meeting of the NY Section (the principal IRE meeting in the world).
October 1: I completed the paper and obtained company approval for its publication.
October 6: I delivered my paper to Mr. Marriott, and he sent it to the printer.
October 15: I received and approved proofs. At the same time, Mr. Marriott had ordered preprints and mailed them to the members of the NY section for comments preparing discussions.
November 2: I presented the brief paper before a well-attended meeting. There were two prepared discussions. Neither had any "future".
January, 1928: My paper was published in the IRE proceedings. It was sandwiched between two major articles by Armstrong and Marconi.
The time between the idea of the paper and the world publication with discussions was only four months! The good old days!
Wasn't there an earlier form of automatic volume control?
Yes. The first marketed radio receiver with any kind of AVC was the Radiola 64 in 1928. It had a triode detector and AVC. It had the benefit of a super heterodyne circuit and was an advanced design by current standards, but its performance was inferior to my lab model of January 2, 1926.
Could you describe the "tuning meter" that you invented for use with a receiver with AVC?
Well, the usual procedure of tuning by the sharp peak of loudness was dulled by the AVC. I immediately perceived the problem and noted that the automatic gain variation would be a useful indicator for tuning. I connected a DC meter to show the current variation in the first IF amplifier tube. This feature was published in my paper in early 1928 and was featured in the RCA set later that year. It is the subject of my U.S. Patent 2080646 (May 18, 1937). The late date of this patent reflects a controversy in the Patent Office, which said it was not an invention. (Does that have a familiar sound?) We appealed to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. Unlike the Supreme Court, they were competent in patents and instructed the patent office to issue a patent. This is the only one of my U.S. Patents to be finally adjudicated in the courts.
What difference did the introduction of the screen-grid tube have on your work?
In about 1926, the "screen-grid tetrode" was announced by GE and soon became available from RCA as the UV-224. The fourth electrode was a screen interposed between the control grid and the plate. It permitted the passage of electrons but eliminated the capacitive coupling. This avoided the need for neutralization and the Hazeltine patents on that feature. They had had a useful life of five years from practical application to obsolescence. Fortunately we had made other inventions (patents pending) and had built a clientele of manufacturers who placed a great value on our engineering design provided with the patent license. Some of our inventions were equally applicable to the screen-grid amplifier, including the diode AVC.
About 1927, there was another major development, which did not directly affect the use of our designs. RCA introduced the indirectly heated cathode so the cathodes could be heated by AC instead of a 6-volt storage battery. Also a rectifier was replacing the "B battery" of 90 or 135 volts. The principal supplier of storage batteries was the Philadelphia Storage Battery Company, known as Philco. The radio market had far exceeded their automobile market, so their production capacity far exceeded the future need.
Approximately what year was that?
Probably 1927. So they thought about it and decided that they should go into the manufacture of radio receivers, which is where the money was going that previously went to buy their batteries. They inquired around, and they were well advised that our company, Hazeltine Corporation, was the outstanding independent source of receiver designs. We were designing receivers for many radio receiver manufacturers at that time. So they came to us, and by our standard formula, took a blanket license under our patent portfolio, which was accompanied by engineering services to design receivers. So probably early in 1928 we became acquainted with their engineers, whose background was chemicals, and they were quite quick to catch on to what was needed to manufacture radio receivers. I was second or third in charge of our laboratory at that time, and the design of the Philco receivers was assigned to me. We were then located in a loft building in New York City.
Did Philco come to you with the idea that they would manufacture several models in different price ranges?
I guess we would say one at a time. Their first year they only had the Philco-76. Designing one model from scratch was enough of a challenge. I guess they had several different cabinets for it, but it was the same chassis. So we conferred with their engineers and lined up a receiver design that seemed to be attractive for their purpose.
Did they tell you that they wanted to reach a certain market? That they wanted a hundred-dollar receiver, say? How was it that they told you what they were interested in?
That was the usual approach: Talk to the manufacturer to see what he wanted, and then we adapted our engineering knowledge to it. So I came to work with one or two of their principal engineers to design a model that would be attractive for their production ideas. The outcome was the Philco-76, and this was soon after the advent of screen grid tubes, which were the first easy way to make tuned RF amplifiers. So this receiver was to have a TRF amplifier and the ordinary detector and audio amplifier. It was not particularly unusual — naturally we'd had some practices that were pretty common in the receivers we designed. But it gave them a good start in organizing a marketing system and competing, which they did very well. And the reasonable success of that first receiver led to our considering what design they should make the following year. In this intercourse we suggested several innovations. The principal one was diode automatic volume control, which I had invented early in 1926 and was not yet in use anywhere. In fact, there was only one receiver with automatic volume control (and that was a kind that became obsolete) in an RCA receiver. So I designed the Philco-95 as the first receiver to incorporate our automatic volume control, which we called diode AVC.
May I ask why earlier designs hadn't incorporated that if you invented it in '26?
It was difficult to get enough RF amplification to operate the diode at a high enough level to use it for control. The screen-grid tube had partly alleviated this problem. That was the reason at happened in this point in history. But it's interesting that none of our other licensees were ambitious enough to incorporate it yet.
That was because it added considerably to the expense of manufacture?
Yes. There was an additional challenge to the receiver design. And incidental to that the Philco-95 included two stages of tuned RF amplifiers and an additional stage of untuned RF amplifier, which became feasible only with screen grid tubes. So with that amount of amplification we had a high enough signal level to operate a diode detector and to derive a control bias needed for AVC. There wasn't anything particularly difficult in that design, but there was some innovation and mainly the first popular receiver to utilize automatic volume control.
Were you part of a team designing that or was it largely your own design?
I had the benefit of team experience, but the actual design of the receiver I worked out directly with the Philco engineers. Looking back, it was crude in many respects, but that's the usual reaction to earlier designs.
And the 95 had, I understand, great success.
Yes, it became famous overnight. And in all fairness, it was partly the marketing efforts of Philco. But they emphasized the automatic volume control, which no other receiver — except in a high-priced RCA set — could advertise at that time. And that, I might say, was an automatic volume control that wasn't very good.
It was a different design?
Yes. It lacked some fundamental advantages that were offered in the diode type.
Did you have any part in the marketing of the 95? Did you suggest that these are the really special features of this that they should push?
They had frank conversations with the leaders in our laboratory, who were able to give very helpful advice on marketing and features. I was mostly involved with the engineering.
What connections did you have with Philco after that?
Naturally we had a very close relationship after introducing them to the radio broadcast field. In later years we were particularly active in designing low-cost receivers during the Depression, where Philco really excelled. By today's standards their cathedral table models are pretty weird, but they were good in their day, and they enabled the manufacture of a rather impressive receiver without too much money.
Was lowering the price the main thrust of development in the 'thirties?
Yes. And the cathedral table model was very popular, partly because it was large enough to carry a fairly good loudspeaker. So it left plenty of room for the receiver design, which then could be — by today's standards — rather crude but easily manufactured.
Was that a prime consideration with other sets — that you had to keep the spatial volume down?
Not so much, because size was cheaper than electronics. And size was impressive. And the table cathedral model was very popular.
Did Hazeltine have any financial interest in how well Philco did?
Only the amount of royalties.
So they were getting a royalty on each set manufactured?
Yes. We had a package license and that was the only way we could have achieved the results we did during the 'thirties. So there wasn't any dickering about which patents — or which features. They were immediately immunized from any infringement claims from our company. And that made it simple, and there was enough to support our engineering staff to give very good service. Our engineering staff was maybe half a dozen at the time they entered the field. And during the 'thirties it built up to maybe 50 engineers, which was a big staff in those days.
What was the subsequent history of the connection between Philco and Hazeltine?
The next major development was TV. And during the late 'thirties, there were several laboratories experimenting with TV. I've forgotten how much Philco engaged in those experiments. And I think, as I remember, not very much.
What were the subsequent radio receiver designs?
Presently came the war, and materials were clamped down.
And after the war?
There was an entirely different world, and our method of operation was out of favor in the courts. The net result was that after the war licensing was very difficult, and the company — as I may have mentioned — had emphasized manufacturing equipment for the military. From a staff of about 200 at the end of the war, they gradually built up to about 2500 employees, mostly manufacturing equipment for the military with a sizeable research laboratory and developing such equipment.
What was the nature of your work at Hazeltine before World War II.
Well, first the company started in a few rooms in the attic of the Electrical Engineering Building at Stevens. We had a half-time secretary, gradually afforded a machinist, and from 1924 to '29 our laboratory did not exceed three or four engineers. We had a good start in the designing of the heterodyne receiver, which was very common from '23 to '27. So we emphasized testing equipment. I was working part time during that period, and when I went to full-time employment in 1928, my first assignment was to develop better testing equipment. That's something that I enjoyed, and it was a very powerful challenge. So between 1928 and 1929 we developed by far the most sophisticated testing equipment that existed anywhere in the radio industry including RCA General Electric, who specialized in testing equipment.
What was the motivation for that?
We were designing receivers systematically at a time when most of the designs were slipshod. And the principal test was to turn it on and listen to it to see if you could get KDKA in Pittsburgh first, and then see if you could get West Coast stations at night. It was very crude, and GE and then RCA were leaders to the extent that progress was being made outside of our company. But I think it's fair to say that our company passed their level of testing — rather gradually, but rather substantially — before 1930.
I'm curious about those early years with Hazeltine, after you began full-time work in '28. Were you given specific tasks to work on? Who was it who was your immediate supervisor?
Our chief engineer was MacDonald, and he was a very remarkable leader. And his choice was haphazard; he was a friend of our patent attorney. Well, I've forgotten the details, but our patent attorney could not have evaluated his talents. And, in fact, they hadn't really matured. And he lacked a college degree. He'd been a radio operator, and then he was in the Signal Corps in the latter part of the war, attached to the famous group in Paris headed by Major Armstrong. And I had better mention here that Armstrong was the most inspired inventor in the radio field by any standards. And so MacDonald and Taylor, people I became friendly with later, were on his staff. And after the war MacDonald went to RCA and was attached to their Long Island laboratories, which became RCA Communications. He had a home in Little Neck on Long Island, and the patent attorney had a home in Bayside. And they became acquainted through Armstrong's patents that were handled by our patent attorney.
I see.
So his choice was not competent, but it worked out very well. So then we have a picture that I was a shiny young college student, and MacDonald was a very practical man from the "school of hard knocks." And it took us a little while to communicate. But he made many very intelligent decisions. And one was that when I came to work at the laboratory, I had some familiarity with the company's work, but he assigned me primarily to testing equipment that they needed very much to support the quality of their engineering.
So he asked you to work on specific kinds of instruments that needed to be developed?
Yes. And there wasn't much mystery what we needed. Anything we didn't have was what we needed. And the technology of designing test equipment was fragmentary at that time. So that as much invention went into designing test equipment as went into the actual receiver designs. And I liked that kind of a challenge, partly because you didn't have to worry about the market price as you did in receiver design.
Was there any thought of marketing some of these test instruments?
I don't doubt we talked about it, but there didn't seem to be an opportunity. We were better off using them in marketing our designs.
Did you have a fair amount of autonomy in your daily work?
Yes. I had a marvelous opportunity to exercise my ideas and with some assistance and enough moral support to be very effective. And my work was appreciated.
In 1930 you became director of the Bayside laboratory.
Yes. Between Hoboken and 1930 we added a laboratory in a loft building in New York City. That was from '29 for some years. And here again MacDonald very thoughtfully decided that working for our licensees was less of a challenge than innovation. Not that it didn't involve innovation. But he decided we needed to separate our engineering staff pretty much into two groups, one of which would cooperate with our licensee manufacturers and be primarily, concerned with the economics and the other of which would have freedom for innovation. So he wisely chose me to head up the laboratories in Bayside which were the center of innovation during the 'thirties. To be put in charge of that operation at age 27 was a great opportunity.
How large was that laboratory?
We started with perhaps three or four engineers from the New York laboratory and then hired new engineers from various quarters. And the Depression was coming on, so that we were able to hire outstanding engineers with a salary level we could afford in our staff. And a few of them had wide experience beforehand, and the others were directly from college or with little experience. So there was a gradual increase in our staff from 1930 to 1939.
The circumstances of the Bayside Laboratory are an interesting part of the story. First, our principal patent attorney lived in Bayside out on Long Island, and MacDonald lived in Little Neck. And they spotted an old mansion that was no longer livable. And they bent the zoning enough to occupy that as a laboratory. And so we could make holes in the wall or whatever we wanted. And while it was not comfortable in the summer without air-conditioning, it was a very good location for a growing laboratory organization. And that included machine shops and later on what we needed for television tubes. So that was the beginning of the Bayside lab: In anticipation of that, I built a nice new home in Great Neck, which was about five miles from that laboratory location.
I'm wondering about the nature of your work in those years. How much of it was at a desk where you're thinking through designs or coming up with designs, and how much of it involved actual work with devices?
My principal contribution was innovation by thinking what was possible and what could be improvements. And our staff was extremely competent in carrying out my ideas, making experimental receivers, testing and cooperating with me. So I was working mostly on paper, except I was very close to the laboratory work. And I was a severe critic of the designs they were developing. They had a common reaction that whenever I walked into the room, something didn't work. [Chuckling] But we found solutions. During the Bayside laboratory period in the early 'thirties and middle 'thirties, we developed some extremely sophisticated broadcast receivers with automatic controls, most of which never reached the commercial market. And we have publications of receivers in which we controlled the bandwidth of the receiver in accordance with the requirements. You wanted a narrow band for long distance and a wider band for local. If there was an adjacent channel causing interference, it would shift the tuning away from that channel but still get a good signal. And some of those most advanced receivers are covered in my patents but never went into commercial use.
Do you think in a more favorable economic climate they might have?
It's hard to say. The history of commerce is that the highest quality seldom prevails. But who can say? So, many of my patents are directed to those refinements which never saw the light of day. We had many demonstrations in our laboratory — the world beat a path to our door to see the things we were doing. And it was impressive, and it was encouraging to us; but putting them into production at a profit was a different matter.
If we take that period when you were directing the Bayside laboratory, did that continue until 'forty?
The Bayside laboratory continued until '39. But in '36 I was removed from the responsibility of management so I could spend full time on television developments. Then my associate who was then chief engineer, Dan Harnett, took over the direct supervision of the Bayside laboratory.
And you continued to work at Bayside?
Yes.
Can you summarize the areas of your work on radio receiver design, then of test equipment, and still later, television development?
Yes. The nature of broadcasting was changing. In 1930 the industry was belatedly licensed under the RCA super heterodyne patents. Before, the RCA very shortsightedly had encouraged competition by refusing to license under those patents. But they saw the light of day, and beginning in 1930 we didn't have any fetters to restrict the development of the best receiver we knew how. So in 1930 our laboratory rapidly became the most progressive designer of super heterodyne circuits. Now originally they were feasible only in expensive sets. But we took the super heterodyne into the inexpensive table model. So that was maybe the first event. The next was transatlantic broadcasting on short waves; that was something you couldn't have dreamed of a few years sooner. And there was some market for receivers, which could receive the broadcasting from Europe. So we had a period when we designed the so-called all-wave receiver. It received mostly the broadcast band and short-wave transatlantic broadcasting.
Was that coded transmission?
No, that was phone. And the frequency band was about 6 to 30 megacycles. And that was high enough to involve technology far beyond the broadcast band. So we were very active in designing receivers that would receive both bands. And with the high frequency bands there came new challenges for antennas. Up until 1930 the broadcast receiver usually had a long wire connected to it. By long I mean something like 50 feet long — maybe outdoors, maybe supported by tree. And the portable set was unheard of. Well, there wasn't much antenna design challenge in the broadcast receivers before 1930. The short-wave receivers, on the other hand, presented a challenge to antenna design.
Was that because in the broadcast band — one can't do a lot better than that kind of a simple antenna?
Yes. The largest antenna you could use was still a makeshift. So we made receivers that were tolerant of a wire of some length; and it worked pretty well because the wire picked up a big signal. But then came all-wave receivers and short-wave receivers, and there you could make scientifically-designed antennas, the horizontal dipole type which was maybe 30 feet long strung between two high points. So antenna design became a new field of expertise, which I embraced immediately. And in that field we were shortly designing the best antennas and the best circuits for short-wave reception. But they did not achieve a very wide acceptance, especially in the sense of profit.
Did you patent certain designs?
Did you succeed in getting licensees?
Well, you see, our licensees automatically we had a license to all of our developments. Some of our designs in that field were made in moderate quantities. But that introduced me to the antenna field, which during the war more — and after the war even more — became my specialty. The antennas we made for short-wave receivers were definitely the most advanced designs available in those days. And we were competing with men in RCA Communications where they needed fancy antennas at times, but they didn't have to worry about installing them in various locations.
You were summarizing the different areas in which you worked in this period.
Now along with the short-wave receivers, our existing test equipment became suddenly inadequate. So we had to design new test equipment for short-wave, which was a very different challenge. And one of the principal events of my exposure to that problem was the piston attenuator that we'll be talking more about and which was one of my most remarkable inventions — almost without competition. And so we began making test equipment for several frequency bands instead of just the broadcast band.
Then in the middle 'thirties there were rumblings of wideband FM and television. Wideband FM was not a difficult challenge in receiver design. The real contribution of Armstrong was the concept. So, well, we found ourselves designing receivers for FM in the latter 'thirties. The challenge there was mainly that that brought in another frequency band. Gradually we began using higher and higher frequency bands. So late in the 'thirties the higher frequency band of FM was a challenge to design. But then came the war and interrupted that development. The main development in the middle 'thirties was TV. It became apparent that it was over the horizon. And I must confess I was sort of apathetic toward TV at first because I had enough projects designing receivers for AM radio. But one of my associates, Harold Lewis — a little older than I who, also, incidentally, had worked with Armstrong in Paris — was more aggressive in his thinking and fortunately steered our laboratory into TV development in the early 'thirties. To the extent that that was a different frequency band, it was a new challenge to our testing equipment. I can't overemphasize the theme of testing equipment as being a real limitation on the rate of progress — and an area where we made outstanding contributions. So by the latter 'thirties we were active in FM, which was not a great challenge, and became active in TV, which was a great challenge. So our TV progress in the late 'thirties is a different story that I will enlarge on whenever you like. And that became my principal interest in the late 'thirties.
I'm wondering about how you moved from one of these areas to another. Was that in consultation with MacDonald? Was it his decision or partly your decision?
Well, MacDonald and Harnett and myself were the leaders. And then I mentioned Lewis who became a prime mover in TV. We had a very informal relationship. MacDonald would spend a day now and then out at the Bayside laboratory. And we'd get together — either in the New York laboratory or in Bayside — occasionally and talk over what we were doing. It was very informal, but I must say that the initiative of MacDonald and Harnett were far greater in influence than mine because my nose was so close to the grindstone that I was thinking about improvements rather than radical new lines of development.
Did you feel personally, in those years, that there was a tension between what was most interesting to you and avenues you wanted to pursue and what was likely to be most profitable to the company?
There wasn't any tension between those at all. First, all of us were interested in some degree in both avenues. And I was consulted often on problems for the New York laboratory. And they cooperated in various ways with our work at the Bayside laboratory. But we had a very healthy atmosphere of reasonable support by the company and encouragement. I might say MacDonald was our buffer with the board of directors and funding, and he had his problems because the board of directors were not familiar with this field, really. And he managed to work with them remarkably well. And during my work in the Bayside laboratories I have to say that I got fully adequate support from management — both in staffing and in freedom of my own operation. It was a very remarkable opportunity. And some of the men I was working with were geniuses, too. Gradually I came to appreciate them. [Chuckling]
I'm curious about the radio market in those early years. Was there a lot of pressure to come up with innovations almost for the sake of innovations for the latest new model the way that happened in the automobile industry?
Well, there were two or three periods that were well defined. The period of early broadcasting was a free-for-all. There was a great amount of effort expended in making your own sets. In the early 'thirties the Herald Tribune had a Sunday supplement every week and the latest ideas on how to make your own set. Sears Roebuck had a catalog of parts for making radio sets, including amateur transmitters. And during that period, before the Depression, there was enough money to go around. So that cutthroat competition did not develop. And that was healthy for the industry, and there was a reasonable support for innovation. But most of the innovation was rather low-level. It was how to make a good receiver with reasonable complication.
Then came the Depression, which, incidentally, was just the time that Philco was getting underway. And then the price of the receiver became the most important factor, not its performance. And in that period we — and especially Philco among our various licensees — designed and sold some pretty good receivers at prices that the market could afford. At the same time, we were increasing the emphasis on cheap receivers — not so much smaller, as cheap. And I should mention that in the middle 'thirties was the birth of high fidelity as a name and as a concept. So we were very much conscious of that, and we advertised our designs as leading the way in high fidelity, which pretty much they did. That involved not only the receiver design that had been my specialty, but also loudspeaker design. So in the early 'thirties-in Bayside, we had very ambitious projects in making better loudspeakers. What we actually did was to take the best that we could find manufactured by other companies and evolved methods of testing [by means of] which we were able to select for our licensees the better types of loudspeakers. So in the middle 'thirties "high fidelity" was a buzzword.
Did that have any clear technical definition?
No. There was the impetus to design receivers with more complete audio bandwidth. And there were methods of detection and amplification that could preserve the quality. And we were leaders in that field.
Was that more development in the loudspeaker than in the receiver?
The actual loudspeaker developments were mostly done by a specialized company and we tried to become familiar with them and select the best and find ways of evaluating their performance.
You've already mentioned that Hazeltine was special in its emphasis on test instruments and its development of that. How else does Hazeltine differ from other companies?
Mostly more advanced and more freedom. An engineering staff of a manufacturing company had very severe constrictions, and we didn't have those. We could make something before we decided whether it would make a profit. And that was the real opportunity of leadership.
How about the training and education of the engineers at Bayside labs and at Hazeltine generally? Were they typical of engineers at the time?
In the period of the New York laboratory that was not an active subject. We were tagging along with current ideas pretty much and developing novelty where it was needed. In the Bayside laboratory where we were less under pressure for day-to-day deliveries to our licensees of designs, I soon started classes for engineers where I would introduce them to my latest thinking and the latest thinking in the profession. And to have classes like that that were attended by all of our engineers — young and old — in company time was very unusual in that day. The Bell Laboratories even were not outstanding in that respect — yet.
Were these mainly your instruction?
Yes. I invited others to lecture to some of the classes where they had particular experience or knowledge. But mostly I was developing the knowledge needed. And as I developed it in my own mind, it was a good time to spread it. So that's what happened.
What about the formal education — the school education — of these engineers? Did most of them have just a Bachelor's Degree?
When did it become common to hire people with a Master's in electrical engineering?
Common only after the war. It's interesting for me to recall that I had just a very few Ph.D. graduates on my staff, but we didn't make a big fuss over it. They were typically educated less in the practical engineering as the engineering degree seldom went to a Ph.D. And so we didn't call them "Doctor." Two I remember as early as 1929 went to classes with me when I was at Hopkins in graduate work. They were valuable additions to our staff, but they had to be converted to engineers. Whereas I was an engineer beforehand. So whatever education I got in graduate school built on engineering. You might say one of the great mistakes of my life was that I didn't complete the requirements for a Ph.D. after three years studying at Hopkins. It would have been rather easy for me to complete the requirements. But, what did the poet say? "The world is too much with us; late and soon. Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers." And I was just more interested in practical work.
Would it have been useful to you to have had the Ph.D. Degree?
It didn't mean very much in the engineering profession because there were not many. There were some brilliant scientists who were also engineers; they were mostly in the big laboratories like GE and Westinghouse. So the fact that I didn't have a degree was never really a handicap. But I'm sorry I didn't appreciate more my engineers that did have the degree.
There was one instance in the middle 'thirties when we became very conscious of higher education. In the early days of television experiments Zworykin developed the iconoscope, which was the only good television tube for picking up pictures and transmission. And they jealously guarded the iconoscope so you couldn't buy one. About 1935 we perceived that if we were to progress, we had to have a complete demonstration equipment which only RCA had at that time. And so by fortunate circumstances one of our engineers had been acquainted with a Ph.D. from Cal Tech who had excellent preparations of the type required to construct a television picture tube. And in the 'thirties we didn't have any trouble employing people. So we employed him in 1935.
Who was that?
His name was Hergenrother. And starting from scratch in our Bayside laboratories, he developed a chemistry laboratory and glass blowing facilities to a level that he was able to produce a year later an iconoscope that was the best that we ever experienced. And that was the keystone of our television demonstration equipment.
And that was possible because of his training at Cal Tech?
Because he had a basic Ph.D. training at Cal Tech that involved chemistry and physics and glass blowing. And so we really profited from the higher level of education at that stage. Afterward some of our engineers were Ph.D.'s but it wasn't universal.
I'm wondering whether, because of your own advanced training in physics, you were more interested in engineers who had more academic training than other companies were.
No. I tried to evaluate them on their competence, which did not require Ph.D. level. And some were physics majors, and more commonly they were engineering majors at a time when engineering was rather elementary as it was taught.
Was there a great difference in the knowledge of physics that an engineer had from that of physics major?
If you're talking about basic physics, yes. But if you're talking about application to branches of engineering, no. They developed.
So you didn't have any rule of thumb that you preferred the physics majors over the engineering majors.
No. I'm a little embarrassed that some of our best educated engineers — We had one Ph.D. from Stanford that had a breadth of background that I didn't have. By that time Stanford was strong in engineering. So I didn't really appreciate them except in the degree in which they were able to talk our language, where they soon became competent.
Well, let me ask about your judgment about the value of your graduate physics training in your work in those decades.
First, my father advised me to take physics degree — Bachelor's Degree — instead of engineering. He was wiser than he realized because engineering in the early 'twenties was largely cookbook science. And I think he perceived that. He, incidentally, had a Master's Degree in horticulture, which was more science than practice. And which he put to practice very well in his early days. So he advised me to take physics degree.
I should give you a little introduction to my education at those levels. We had moved to Washington, DC just before I was entering high school. So in Washington I had what you would regard as a good high school education, including some subjects that were supposed to be required for engineering — like mechanical drawing and some things like that. But my high school education was very good except for a dearth of general subjects such as physiology and Latin. German, incidentally, was outlawed during World War I.
So many of your classes were in physics and math?
Many? I don't know. Of course we had English and math, which was good by the standards of those days, which meant a high school didn't teach calculus. One of the benefits of my high school education's low intensity, was it left me lots of time to do other things. The only course in which I ever got 100 was plane geometry. It just came natural to me. So on the educational ladder, I graduated from a high school in Washington D.C. which was good by the standards of high schools in those days.
Our family was struggling to say the least. My father had a government salary, and five children to support. So when it came time for college, we had a rather easy choice and that was to go to George Washington University so I wouldn't have to go away to school. Now your first reaction might be that it was a handicap to stay home during school. But at home I had my basement laboratory where I spent more time than I did studying. That was the beginning of my later career. So George Washington University offered seven four-year paid scholarships by competitive examination in the Washington high schools. And the tuition was $175 a year. That was significant in that day. I scored third out of the seven on the competitive examination. Incidentally, my sister two years younger scored second, and my sister four years younger scored first. They went to George Washington, too.
The University had a mediocre engineering department. It was, shall we say, embryonic. I entered the school during the first year they offered a B.S. in physics, so I was their first student. The curriculum was under development. That meant they had a very small staff, and I was their first student. So I was very close to the head of the physics department had freedoms that I wouldn't have had in a larger school. * As an unexpected byproduct, the physics course was oriented mainly to Masters Degrees for government employees; in physics that meant the Patent Department and the National Bureau of Standards. So the same physics courses that were developed for those seeking Masters Degrees, I took as undergraduate physics courses. So when I got a B.S. in physics, I had the preparation for a Masters Degree.
I should go a little further on George Washington. I was so close to the department head that he was very lenient, and I usually could make good grades just by listening in class; I didn't do much homework. He appreciated my talents and got me help as a laboratory assistant. So I had much more freedom — including my home laboratory — than I'd have had if I'd gone to MIT. I often wonder what would have happened if I'd gone to MIT and been under pressure constantly during those years. The net result however was that I graduated at the head of my class — largely as a result of lenience on the part of my physics professors. I was a little bit embarrassed to graduate at the top. I knew I hadn't done as much work as I should, but I took it in stride.
Then you had three years of graduate work at Johns Hopkins in physics.
Yes. As I was doing well in George Washington my father looked for something near home, and Baltimore was near home. Johns Hopkins was an outstanding academic institution in physics and even more so in chemistry. So my father and I went over to talk with the department head, Dean Ames, who was later president of the university. He and I got along fine, so we set up a physics course for me to continue after graduating from George Washington, which didn't offer graduate physics courses of any standing.
Life at Hopkins was a very leisurely experience. They had a small dormitory for graduate students where I had two rooms that I shared with one of my friends. Meals were served inexpensively. So I was in direct contact with the graduate students mostly in physics and chemistry. The quality of education however was not that great. They had qualified professors — some were famous — but the science of education hadn't permeated colleges yet. So the method of education was not terribly good. Nevertheless by attending Johns Hopkins I did gain: a broader perspective on physics; at a leisurely pace.
Were you very busy with these other activities in those days?
Yes. I was commuting to New York at least once a month and doing summers. I was able easily to keep up with the pace and continue these outside activities.
Interestingly, one of these outside activities was the building of a pulse transformer. Among my colleagues and friends as graduate students were Breit and Tuve, who became famous in later years for their work with the ionosphere. [With] Tuve I had a particularly close affiliation because he also came from Minnesota. One evening after dinner they cornered me, and they said, "We've got a problem. We're making a transmitter for high-powered pulses to send up to the ionosphere and reflect back again. And we need a transformer, and we don't know how to make a pulse transformer." Well, during the summers I had worked with Hazeltine one of the projects he was working on involved what was then unknown—a pulse transformer and I was familiar with its workings. I translated that knowledge to Breit and Tuve's requirement, and I designed the first radar pulse transformer. It worked in their experiment. Incidentally, during the war the word "pulse transformer" was classified "Secret" because it was still a new concept.
What does a pulse transformer do?
In radar pulses you have to deal with power at various levels of current and voltage. The pulse transformer develops the current and voltage needed to drive the power tube to send pulses. It was a new world designing circuits for pulses where the peak power and not the thermal problems were foremost. So Breit and Tuve's had that problem in making their ionosphere experiment.
You said earlier that you didn't properly appreciate the training that some of the Ph.D.'s on your staff had. Does that mean that you later came to think more highly of physics training?
Well, in the three years before 1928 the level of education in graduate courses had not advanced nearly as far as it did later. It was in the 'twenties that Ph.D. education in the most prominent colleges was evolving. It had advanced very far by 1930. And the force that I was employing in the 'thirties had the benefit of that advance. The most prominent professor of radio engineering in the 'twenties was German. Zenneck had written one of the first really inspired textbooks on radio and then radio measurements in the 'twenties. So our Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins was educated far in advance of any of the rest of us.
Did that make a difference in the work that was to be done?
His confidence did. I didn't pay much attention to the fact that he had a doctorate at first. I was used to lots of Ph.D.'s around Hopkins, and that's the way it was. I did get the benefit of that advanced education. It wasn't until the 'thirties that you could take Terman's courses at Stanford and come out with a really advanced knowledge of radio technology.
Was a broader view and understanding of physics useful in your engineering work?
Not very. I had a particular handicap. In that that period was a transition from analog science to quantum science. I didn't like quantum theory; I resisted it. So I got a less complete education in the pre-quantum physics, and that was a confusion in my educational history.
I'd like to ask you now about the transition of radio from the "cut-and-try" era to a new radio science.
The transition period was just beginning in the two summers that I worked at the Bureau of Standards. That was a great opportunity to become a little acquainted with radio. The one event that I remember was probably the first outstanding radio textbook in the English language, written by a Professor Morecraft at Columbia. It was terribly primitive by today's standards, but it was a fairly massive volume. One day at the Bureau of Standards the librarian came around and said we're taking a club order for Morecraft. Of course everybody bought Morecraft on the club order.
What does "club order" mean?
Well, he made a deal where we got approximately two dozen volumes at a reduction in price. Morecraft was struggling to make a science out of experiments where people just didn't know what was going on. They knew that a crystal detector rectified, but they had no idea if they were using a doped single crystal of silicon. And so that was a good transition from amateur radio to a pretense at professional level. And there were a couple of more advanced textbooks in England and Germany before Morecraft that we came to use as references later on.
In the American arena typically a radio engineer was someone who worked as an operator — usually on shipboard — and went to radio school, where little teaching of science and much tinkering occurred. Armstrong was a tinkerer, but he was an inspired tinkerer in that he could visualize what was going on without being able to put it down in terms of differential equations and physics. But he was a giant of that period. Then gradually physicists were becoming engineers, and a few names in General Electric were outstanding in that field: Coolidge of the x-ray tube; some others whose names were less famous and don't come to me right away. But the science of radio was developed more in those laboratories than in the colleges. Union College, for example, was good because it was next door in Schenectady. So it was only in the 'thirties that radio became a science. That's why I could play a leading part in the 'twenties because I was able to take the scientific approach to it. That was partly from my education at Hopkins and partly from my indoctrination personally by Professor Hazeltine.
So that your design work was more from an understanding of the physics and the components and the effects you wanted to achieve.
Not very deep. An understanding of it often superficial but adequate.
Did the employment of people at Hazeltine change in that higher education was valued more in the 'thirties and later?
I wouldn't say valued as much as available. Typically the well-educated scientist did not usually go into engineering — he went into research.
I wasn't thinking only about physics training; in some fields of engineering it became more and more common, and a Master's Degree came to be expected.
That was after the war. I think we were progressing from the rudimentary status in the 'twenties to the real growth in the 'thirties. That was partly motivated by the advent of TV. But it was in the 'thirties that we began to have really inspired textbooks. I mentioned Professor Terman's textbook in the middle 'thirties. I should mention two more advanced textbooks. One was Stratton at MIT. He wrote the most advanced textbook on electromagnetic theory published in '39 in the days when microwaves and waveguides were on the horizon. And another was Professor Smythe at Cal Tech whose book was much parallel to Stratton's but Stratton graduated to MKS units, and Smythe did not. So Smythe's textbook never sold. That was the period when MKS units were taking hold, and I cannot overemphasize the higher level of engineering that was possible when we abandoned the old physics units — CGS.
When did that happen in your own work?
In the late 'thirties, and Stratton's textbook was the turning point.
Is that something that happened throughout Hazeltine relatively quickly?
Not all the Hazeltine men were as deep in basics as I was. And some, guided by me even, were struggling with more practical engineering than science. But Stratton's textbook was a turning point in the scientific level of engineering. Incidentally, it was preceded by a physics textbook by Harnwell — who was later president of the University of Pennsylvania — which was very good. And it was broader than Stratton's and did not go as far into some areas. I used Harnwell a good deal. Incidentally, I think he was the first one to publish a physics textbook with MKS units.
How would you explain to a layman how a change of units, the MKS, could make a great difference in radio science?
That's easy. The CGS units-had two systems: electromagnetic units and electrostatic units. And a totally different evolution, totally different viewpoint in practice. And it was just a constant dichotomy when you went to electromagnetics, which was electrical engineering, and were handicapped by constantly having to convert between the two sets of units. The MKS system was based on an electromagnetic unit, but it was expanded to include all units and in addition went to the meter standard in a context that was practical. And we already talked about wavelengths in meters. The electrostatic system was totally foreign to that. In fact, both CGS systems were foreign to that. So that was the turning point where science and engineering merged, and the MKS was suitable for both.
I became a close friend of Stratton's, understandably, during the war after his book came out. And later he was president of MIT. Very charming gentleman with a brilliant mind. Now if I'd gone to MIT in those later years, I'd have been better educated, but that wasn't the time that I was confronted with the problems.
One invention that we'll be talking about which I called the piston attenuator was a waveguide beyond cut-off in the days before there were any waveguides. And the waveguides later on came from MIT and Bell Laboratories. And I'd already used waveguides....
I'd like to ask you about some of your most important inventions, and we'll use this list that's generally chronologically arranged. The first on here is the neutralized TRF amplifier. I know you've written about that in your book, and the very interesting story of your meeting with Hazeltine.
That is described very well in my book, Hazeltine, the Professor, and also in Early Days.
You were the first to actually make such a device?
Were there features of yours that were not in Hazeltine's?
Mostly his approach was more general because he knew principles that I wasn't familiar with. Perhaps the most interesting thing was the method I used for adjusting the neutralizing capacitor. Here what I did was to turn off the vacuum tube, turn off the filament, and adjust the capacitor so I got no signal through. And he gave me credit for introducing that method of adjustment. Big deal!
You spoke this morning a bit about this pulse transformer for Breit and Tuve. Did you continue to do work along that line?
Well, first that wasn't published at all, and I don't know how they approached that subject in what they did publish. And that was something I didn't have a need for again until during World War II.
The next thing on the list is an amplifier for heart-action currents. I know that's also somewhat described in your book.
That was published when the doctors who were working on those subjects published their results. They asked me to write a short companion article describing the equipment. I guess that's listed in my publications. I don't recall whether that was really covered in my book, Early Days.
How was it you came in contact with these people doing the heart research?
Dr. Andrew and Dr. Carter in heart research called on Dean Ames and asked him for a graduate student who might design an unusual amplifier for heart action pulses. Dean Ames said he had "just the man" and directed them to me. They described their needs very clearly. I built for them a pulse amplifier, which was unusual at that time. It was based on my experience with Professor Hazeltine, that I have already mentioned. It served their purpose very well. I demonstrated it in a talk to the JHU chapter of Sigma Xi, using electrodes in contact with the human body. It was the forerunner of the electronic electrocardiogram in common use today. It superseded the cumbersome string galvanometer.
I'd like to ask you now about the piston attenuator that you just mentioned this morning — how it is you came to do that work.
That story is one of our most completely documented, and that's chapter 8 in my book. Wheeler Monographs No. 1. Incidentally, that is one of my favorite inventions.
Why is that?
Because it was just totally new — new concept, new everything. And logically arrived at. There was a need, and I solved the problem.
Was there some special preparation that you had that made it possible for you?
Only my method of approaching these problems. That is, nobody had said you should make something like that. And when I got to working on the subject of designing an attenuator, I very logically came up with that result in several steps.
Is the significance of that talked about in what you've written up?
That article is extremely thorough because, as I said, that's one of the developments that is best documented.
Next on the list, dated 1929, is the VTVM operating half-wave square-law.
That has been documented nowhere. It was a small thing but very important in our day-by-day operations. It was customary to measure our voltages when measuring amplification or something in what we called a vacuum-tube voltmeter, which was essentially a triode vacuum tube turned on to a level of DC, and then the signal increased the amount of DC. The typical operation was to obtain the greatest increase in average current without regard for the amount of current that had to be balanced out in order to set to zero. The conventional method gave an increase in current very small compared with the amount that had to be balanced out so that the balancing was a critical operation. I found there was a way of operating the vacuum tube biased near cut-off so that the increase in current was still square-law, but there was very little current to be balanced out. The result was that the balancing operation was much less critical, and this became the most practical method. I suspect that that has never been used in any other laboratory.
But it was used in Hazeltine?
We adopted it universally.
Why is it that you didn't publish a description of that?
Lots of things didn't get published.
The next on the list is 1932, all-wave antenna circuits.
And that's pretty well covered in my book, Early Days.
The same year, wideband multi-transformer filters.
That was part of the same development that we used in connection with the all-wave antenna circuits.
Was this part of the short-wave antenna development?
Yes. Well, it was all-wave. It was incidental to using one transmission line from antenna to receiver to handle both medium wave and short-wave signals. Incidentally, it was no mean problem making a transformer that would cover that frequency range and would operate between a balanced line and a receiver that was essentially unbalanced, meaning it had one terminal grounded. And that transformer performed that function.
Did you seek patents on most of these antenna innovations?
Do you think that these innovations were widely used?
No. They involved a high degree of refinement, which was not generally afforded.
A lot of people were working at that time on antenna designs?
How good was communication among the engineers working on this topic?
Well, I think most of us published in some journals what we were doing. I published a paper on this subject, and the people at RCA and some other laboratories published related work. In most cases I had gone much further in refinement and level of operation.
What's the principal motivation for engineers in industry working for GE or RCA or Hazeltine for publishing their results?
That's not an easy question. In industry there was some thinking that things should remain confidential so as not to give the competition equal time. We were fortunate in that respect because first, we did not have an income that would depend on confidential work. And secondly, we were releasing most of our results and ideas in reports to our licensing companies. Here I should mention that here, and all through my career, there is a pattern of careful reporting and informative reporting that was unusual — and still is. One reason was that our business was conveying information to other companies.
I can certainly understand that conveying information to the licensees; but if these things are published in the open literature, then everyone has the benefit.
Well, anything we published to the licensees was sure to get around. But I think also it would be only fair to say that the selfish desire for having your work put on the record was a large motivation. I say "selfish"; I don't know, but I think an important motivation was having your work would be recognized.
Did you have the feeling at the time in the early 'thirties, with this antenna work, say, that the leading engineers were making known their results?
I don't know how to answer that. This subject was a live one, and I think there was not any pattern of large organizations encouraging their men to publish. Perhaps it was most common in an organization like Bell Telephone Laboratories who were not in a competitive, profit-oriented operation. But more I think it was the case where the whims of the leaders were controlling rather than any logical sequence of thinking. And I think being brought up in the scientific community where publication probably influenced my attitude, although I was always anxious to tell people what I was doing.
And I take it you encouraged other engineers at Bayside and elsewhere to publish their results?
Would you say generally that the environment at Hazeltine was more like an academic environment than most research in industry?
Well, "academic" is not clearly defined. I don't think the answer is clearly "yes."
Two things that distinguish academic research in contrast to a lot of industry research is that in academia there's more freedom to pursue particular questions and more openness in making results known.
That is a fair inference, but confidentiality has had a great influence on releasing a lot of scientific information. So there isn't a clear answer.
The next item on this list is a study of circuits for level amplification. What brought about that?
First, this problem arose in the neutralized TRF amplifier. The ordinary tuned circuit had a large variation in the coupling impedance as it was tuned over the broadcast band, which was a 3 to 1 ratio that was difficult to cover with one tuning adjustment. So there were many attempts made to cover the band more uniformly. And that was the subject of this item. That is very well covered in my book, Early Days, and in 1930 I published a very long study of various kinds of circuits for obtaining uniform gain in a TRF amplifier.
This seems to be an example of what some people might think of as freer research. That you're stepping back to survey a whole class of circuits rather than working on a particular circuit.
Well, those are not really distinct. The problem was widespread, and there were numerous approaches to it. And people were familiar with it. I think it's fair to say there was no other laboratory made as extensive a study of that problem as we did because it was a very serious problem in the heterodyne receivers and in later receivers using screen grid tubes. It was peculiar to the TRF amplifier as distinguished from the super heterodyne.
Can you tell me about this description of the maximum flat bandwidth attainable in an amplifier with shunt capacitance?
That was the subject of a study in a paper I published in 1939. It was one of two papers that were responsible for my award of the Morris Liebmann Prize of IRE.
Is that described in full?
Incidentally, it was the subject of quite a number of patents for different variations. And the ultimate refinement was seldom afforded; it was a theoretical concept more than a practical design. Because people had found makeshift methods of getting enough bandwidth without going to the circuits required for the maximum result. There was also another factor there and that is I learned gradually that in television a uniform gain over a wide band was not the only objective. Also we had to have what we called linear phase. And the circuits with the maximum uniform gain had what we called phase distortion, which meant that the pulses in television were distorted. And the picture had peculiarities as a result. Incidentally, that subject is thoroughly treated in chapter 11 of my monographs.
In 1941 was a paper on the skin effect, which you called your second most famous paper.
It had been known from the early days of radio that high frequency currents in a wire concentrated on the surface because there was a delay in the currents reaching the inside of the wire. And I guess somewhere around 1910 that subject was recognized by the theoretical giants in the field, and it was named the skin effect because the currents traveled in the skin on the wire. So that was a well-known subject. My paper accomplished two things: One, it described the behavior in more understandable terms than the complete mathematical treatment of the theoretical giants. And, two, from the implications of this study, I perceived a simple way for computing the skin resistance of wires of various cross sections.
Let me give an example of one of the challenges that was recognized. A pair of round wires fairly close together had the current distributed very unevenly, concentrated on the facing sides of the wire, and some mathematical giants went through elaborate computations to predict what the resulting resistance power loss would be. But the incremental-inductance rule, which I devised, said if you know the formula for the inductance, you can, by simple differentiation, derive the formula for the resistance. So the elaborate mathematical treatises by the mathematical giants like Carson at Bell Telephone Laboratories were immediately bypassed if you knew the formula for the inductance. Which we usually did. That led to what I called the "incremental-inductance rule." That received very little attention for some years. But when we began to utilize lines of very unusual cross sections like strip conductors, then it became a determining factor in the amount of loss in a transmission line. And then it got to be recognized so that any article today on the resistance losses in a strip line would refer to that article.
And it wouldn't have been practical to compute that in the theoretical way?
That's a loaded question because some of the properties of a strip line are difficult to compute regardless. But at least this can be said: if you know the inductance of the line, then you have a simple procedure for evaluating the resistance. The inductance always had to be computed anyway because that was a factor in the line wave impedance. So once you knew that, you had a shortcut to the resistance.
This a theoretically derived rule?
It was so simple it was embarrassing. I don't know why the giants didn't see it. I might emphasize that too much education is as bad as too little. I was not adept in the procedures used by the mathematical giants. So I took what they said for gospel, but with the reservation that I'd like to know how to compute it myself. So that's where it ended up.
I know that you've had a hobby of inventing empirical formulas based on your understanding of the phenomena that allow you to compute the values you're interested in.
This is a subset of the phenomenon that I've sometimes described. I've been known to say that the secret of my success has been that I found problems that had simple solutions and thereupon exploited the simple solutions. And some problems, you might say, just don't have them. So I was constantly on the watch for problems having simple solutions. And then when I did, I rode them to death. [Chuckling]
But your principal motivation was to arrive at something that is useful in engineering practice.
Yes. A practical solution, which often meant a formula, that was not too difficult to be interesting. Here I might comment. Today the people who are geniuses in computation by digital filters too readily abandon the concept of simplicity because the power of the digital computers is so immense. And they will write a long program that can be utilized in a few minutes, and they call that a simple solution. Well, I don't!
That's because you think one should have some understanding himself?
Some physical intuition about what was going on. If there's any one thing that is lost more than any other in the computer era, it is that. That has been lost along with the motivation to find a solution that doesn't require a million operations in a second.
I'm very interested in the question of computation in engineering practice. It seems that a number of your published articles have dealt with ways of calculating things such as this 1950 article "Transmission Line Impedance Curves." Your main objective was to reduce the labor required to get answers from engineering theory?
Both that and improving the understanding of the phenomenon. There was a day, for example, when to compute the inductance of a conductor, you referred to a table that someone had derived by very laborious computations. And when I devised the simple inductance formula that I mentioned, it was assumed that you would refer to one of those tables which, as you know, is very laborious and you have to interpolate. It's a labor-wasting device. By means of that formula I perceived, by graphical representation, that the table had some properties, and I accumulated quite a number of tricks for perceiving what kind of a simple formula might be useful. Like, if you have a formula that looks like a hyperbola, if you invert it, it becomes a straight line. And I used that principle to devise my first simple inductance formula. It was surprising how most of the workers resisted that approach and were wedded to the table because it was a habit — that's what they were taught. They were not taught how to compute; they were taught to refer to the table. But the ones who shared my approach seemed to appreciate the value of that formula.
So even when there was an appropriate table, you would prefer to devise some formula that would give you the answer.
Yes, the formula gives you a picture of the phenomenon, and the table just doesn't.
The table is equivalent to someone having a computer program that will give the answer.
Yes. My first simple inductance formula was very easily derived, and Hazeltine had also devised some simple formulas for multi-layered coils, on which I patterned my formulas. They were restricted to coils in a range of shapes; they were not universal. But my formula was universal enough to cover practically all the single-layer coils anybody was using. Then in later years — I mean, much later — I honed these techniques in various problems and went back to the inductance formula in order to devise a formula that would cover all shapes, from short coils to long coils. I devised methods of working on those approximations where I would find one sort of empirical formula, which would handle one extreme and another that would handle the other extreme. Then I became very proficient in devising mathematical tricks for merging one into the other. I don't know of anyone who has adopted that hobby [Chuckling] other than myself. That's some feeble approach, as you might imagine. But the later inductance formulas that I derived were a rather extreme application of those principles combined with intuition.
The final formula you would come up with is not only, I take it, something that has been put into a single formula, but gives you some understanding of the whole range?
Sometimes. You have to understand if you devise the formula, but the formula isn't necessarily clear as to its implications. But there's one feature of my early simple formula that was appreciated by some of the people using it. And that was that it was reversible for analysis or synthesis.
By, analysis you mean understanding a given device, and by synthesis designing something with certain properties?
Yes. In engineering design almost always the motivation is synthesis. And almost all the formulas that you find in the literature are expressed in a form where there isn't an explicit solution to the inverse operation. My early inductance formula had that reversibility, and quite a few people perceived that and used it by reversing it to synthesis terms, which I did not do in my first paper. And so in later years, as I derived more sophisticated formulas for analysis, I also arrived at a sense of what kind of formulas could be reversed so that the synthesis could be computed by slide rule and not by trial and error. That was the most advanced result of my various exploratory works in that field. That reached a peak with my formulas for strip lines, which no doubt we'll be talking about separately. But other people have been able to compute strip lines only from the analytical viewpoint and usually with very complicated computer programs. I found programs that I described as slide-rule level for computing either the analysis or the synthesis. Since you mentioned slide rules, I should digress for a moment. The saddest moment of my life was when I put away my slide rule.
When did that happen?
With me it happened when I first acquired the Hewlett Packard — was it Model 73? — personal calculator, which was in the early 'seventies. The problems that we were doing on a slide rule to maybe three significant figures then we were able to do to ten significant figures. And I didn't mind the precision, but what the calculator lost was the — what I call the — analog sense of working on a slide rule. You could see where it was going, and with the computer that's all done in the dark.
Also you have some kinesthetic appreciation of the magnitudes with the slide rule.
And how difficult it is to get precision beyond a certain point. As you may have noticed, one of the articles in my book of monographs is on the operation of a slide rule. I devised procedures for the slide rule that were far beyond any that were available in instruction books. So at the time I wrote that article it would have been extremely valuable to one class of engineers. Now here I'm referring to the difference between different classes of engineers. One engineer is motivated wholly to get a result. And the other is motivated to get the result by the simplest process. So my studies of the slide rule enabled procedures that were not in the instruction books and were very helpful at solving some typical problems. I want to emphasize the difference in approach between the two categories of engineers because some are satisfied to get a useful result, perhaps by an excessive amount of effort, but some way so that it works. While I always stressed the need for getting a procedure that has wide application so that it doesn't just apply to the problem at hand. So you may have run across the title of my invited editorial about 1950 entitled "The Real Economy of Engineering."
I have a copy of that.
That was expressing my accumulated wisdom on that subject. The day after it was published, I got a letter from Westinghouse in Pittsburgh saying they wanted 50 reprints to distribute to their engineers. [Chuckling] The punch line in that article was that you should work hard to find the easy way. And that's what I've always done.
This relates very much to the question I wanted to ask. When I was thinking of the study of high-energy physics in the last couple of decades, I was surprised to find that graduate students — they're the ones who do most of the work on the experiments in high energy physics — they spend perhaps 75% of their time at a computer terminal. Programming these days is done at the terminal, of course. Which is to say that 75% of their time they're trying to just carry out some calculation that has been thought out in advance; so that it's a kind of calculation, rather than being especially demanding in terms of physics insight. I'm curious about engineering practice at this time period we've been talking about. How much just sheer calculation was involved in the engineering work?
There are two levels of engineering: One is innovation, where you're finding results that nobody found before. The other is just cookbook design. And I emphasized the innovation angle, which from one viewpoint means simplification of the cookbook design and an appreciation that simplification is possible and available.
Do you have any estimate of how much of the work being done at Hazeltine was more or less straightforward calculation?
In the earlier days of broadcast receivers usual methodology was trial and error. The people who had some insight or some computing power reached the end result by a shorter process. But the circuits and the configurations were usually complicated enough so that they could not be entirely computed. And I think that is typical in science as well as engineering.
I was prompted to that question by the fact that you'd written this monograph on slide rules and that some of your other writings deal with calculating devices and shortcuts, as if that's important in engineering practice.
Yes, it is. There has been on the average too little attention to simplifying the methods as distinguished from doing something that will work.
We've just been talking about the incremental inductance rule. In '47 you published "The Fundamental Limitations of Capacitance or Inductance in Small Antenna."
Yes. That study had very interesting consequences. First, I was confronted with a problem of designing a small antenna to drop in a drill hole — like an oil well — for measuring the behavior of radio waves in the hope of finding some help in prospecting. That pretty much didn't materialize, but in working on that just after the war for the Seaboard Oil Company —
Did they approach you? I know that you had begun work as a consulting engineer about that time.
Yes. What happened was that one of my closest associates — Professor McIlwain of the University of Pennsylvania — was acquainted with the head of Seaboard Oil Company. He thought there might be some way of utilizing our radar experience in prospecting. And he interested the oil company in financing a project for us to explore the behavior of the ground. I might anticipate the end result in oil prospecting: it did not yield anything that appeared to be useful.
But one of the problems I had was making a small antenna that could be dropped into a drill hole. So I naturally considered the two principal types of small antennas, which I designated as C or L. Getting to work on that, I discovered an extremely simple formula that was common to both types of antennas. The capacitive antenna, the C type, was commonly a wire or some grid of wires, and the inductive or L type was commonly what we call a loop, a large coil. In the handbooks and in all the theoretical work, they call it two separate kinds. I guess that might have been an offshoot of the scientists having electromagnetic and electrostatic theories that were entirely separate. Here I had a limited amount of space, so I said, Which one would do best in a limited amount of space? I discovered what shouldn't have been so surprising but was an entirely new concept, that if they were the same size, either type could be designed and you'd get about the same result. And so I published that in the paper called "The Fundamental Limitations of Small Antennas." The cookbook family in the profession resisted that approach. They said, "You can improve one or the other; there isn't any limitation." And it was hard to prove or disprove. One character in the Air Force Laboratories spent a million or two million dollars in grants to people who said they could beat this limitation.
Without success?
It was a matter of definition. They did not properly define the limitations, and after a while this character succumbed at an early age. The next year the annual symposium by the Air Force invited me to present the key speech, showing the soundness of this concept.
So this was a very important paper?
Yes. And my concept was important, but in retrospect it was so nearly obvious that it's hard to imagine that the intellectual giants in the field missed it.
And it's interesting how you came to the question.
So we say, How was I able to define how the two were equivalent? Because they looked different, had different configurations. I did that by evoking a concept that was common in my early work with Professor Hazeltine. He defined the losses in an inductor or a capacitor in terms of power factor, which was a well-known term from power engineering, which was his background. The difference being that in power engineering you wanted the power factor to be large, and in radio circuits, like inductors, we wanted the power factor to be small so that we could treat them more like pure inductor or pure capacitor. So the power factor as an expression of losses, I inherited from my early contacts with the Professor. What I discovered when I went to work on these two antennas, that if I defined each one by a volume, that you could not make an antenna that would exceed a certain power factor of radiation if it was confined within certain dimensional volume. That was a very radical concept, and it wasn't until I tackled this particular problem that the relationship became clear to me. It had never become clear to anybody else, and it was used before everybody accepted it.
I take it there was some direct opposition to it?
Well, the hotshot engineers didn't like to be told you can't do anything beyond a certain point in a certain volume. And I think they knew it, but it was not easy to define. So my contribution was defining the limitation in terms of a volume, which contained the antenna.
In 1950 you published a set of charts?
I was always accumulating formulas and graphs, which I found useful for design. There were some cases where a chart is more useful than a formula. Well, you can see the trends, for example. A chart is most useful for estimating where you don't need high precision but you want to see trends. So I had developed for my own use some interesting charts, and I published three of them in one article — in one issue — of the IRE Proceedings. One was the so-called reactance chart. Are you familiar with that?
No.
That is a chart that relates inductance, capacitance and reactance on a peculiar grid. I don't just know the origin' but I do know that General Radio Company had published some charts of the type that were found very useful. And there my contribution was mostly in providing the skill and work of drawing up a chart covering a very wide range of values, and also emphasizing some utility of the chart which was not commonly recognized. That was basically a matter of having an engineer who was skilled in drawing these charts. If you've ever tried to draw precision charts, you know that that requires a particular skill far beyond what ordinary drafting requires. So my contribution there was getting the more-advanced chart drawn and then writing some instructions for its use, which were not generally familiar, so as to make it most useful.
Then the second part of this series was the transmission-line impedance curves. Understandably, as people explored different cross sections of transmission lines, for each one they would draw a chart of its impedance — sometimes in a range that could be computed, sometimes not — and so over the literature there was a smattering of charts of this nature, but usually very restricted in their application. I was particularly interested in transmission lines, which involved a circular cross section of conductor near a shield of planar or rectangular configuration. Typically it would be a single wire above the ground or a pair of wires. Or a single wire, for example, in a square shield. All of these things have become very useful in various applications. There were only a very few cases where even the mathematical giants been able to write a formula that would cover dimensional over the entire range from a small wire to a large wire near contact.
So I had become interested in that, and I made a study of analyzing the two extreme cases. That is, not only the small wire, which was the thing usually computed, but also a large wire near contact, which in only a few cases had been computed at all. And by computing the extreme cases, I was able to draw curves merging from one extreme to the other, so these curves were the result of that exercise. As you'll see, one set of curves is for wires near contact. There was almost no information available on those cases, which I was running into in my daily work. So, as I say, it was not too difficult to devise formulas for the small wire. But for a large wire near contact, nobody had done it for most of the cases. So I wrote formulas for the two extremes and then merged them graphically and intuitively. Later on I learned how to cover some of those regions more accurately. But this was the first publication of design curves for round wires, which were both small and large. So we get to this point. I submitted these for publication, and I guess I can say they were sent to the wrong reviewers. The reviewers they were sent to clearly had no experience addressing this problem, and they rejected the paper because they said everything in this paper was already known. Well, first, that wasn't correct. And secondly, what was known was not presented in the most useful form.
That was particularly this on transmission line impedance?
Yes, that was the extreme of these considerations. So just at the time I was rejected by editorial reviewers, I was sitting across the table in a committee meeting from the editor-in-chief. Dr. Goldsmith was one of the founders of the IRE and taught at City College, New York. And he was the head of their laboratory, which was utilized by the RCA for some years. At any rate, he and I were good friends, so across the table he said the reviewers had turned down this paper because they said there wasn't anything new. First I showed their ignorance because if they had been confronted with these problems, they would have known the dearth of formulas and graphs that were available. And secondly, there wasn't any presentation which was anywhere nearly as comprehensive as the graphs that I was showing. He said he suspected that, so he passed the papers for publication. Well, after that came up, the IRE got a letter from a reader out in the sticks somewhere that said, "This is the kind of papers we want in the IRE Proceedings!" [Laughter] I never knew who the inept reviewers were — maybe it was just as well because I would have shown them that letter.
Do you think these various curves were widely used?
Some of the things that I was working on were not what many people were working on. So in that respect the use was not all that wide. But I had them reprinted for handing out in our laboratory; and, here again, an engineer working on similar problems had a copy of these curves on his desk.
Were there many such curves in the literature?
That's a loaded question when you say "such." There certainly were many design curves, and it was very exceptional for design curves to cover the entire range of dimensional ratios, which mine did. It was typical that somebody, by some ingenuity perhaps, was able to draw some curves that were valid for a range of values but not the complete range. Incidentally, often these curves were the result of measurements. And measurements, as you know, can never be exact.
The response of that one reader that was pleased with this article suggests that it wasn't something that IRE published all the time.
That's correct. More often design curves — or analytic curves — such as these came out of handbooks. So that for the state-of-the-art you would look in a handbook. It was there that you would find the extreme deficiency that I was addressing. The handbook would show a few cases, but nothing comprehensive. While we're talking about handbooks, which were subject all by themselves, I might digress. When I was making amateur equipment in the 'twenties, the usual handbook was a radio catalog that collected a few formulas in the rear so that you'd keep their catalog on your desk. [Laughter] And I was always intrigued by those formulas, some of which I could see their weaknesses and others of which I used when I had need. But one of the earliest publications in radio was a German publication entitled, "The Handbook." And I've forgotten whether that was the book by Zenneck or another name. But it's interesting because someone in Germany had — earlier than in this country seen the need for a design handbook. In this country there were not many collections of what you would call handbooks. And so in my notebooks you would find my do-it-yourself handbook. I'll show you one that I have at hand. This little notebook I started when I was in high school and continued in my early college years. Whenever I saw a formula that I thought might be useful whether it was in the back of a catalog or wherever I would enter it here.
This was my do-it-yourself handbook. Compared with the knowledge of, I would say, many engineers in those days, this was more advanced in concept.
At that time did you try to understand the physics behind these formulas or were these mainly tools for design?
I had some concept of the relations involved, but I was mainly motivated to find ways of computing things before you went to measurement. So I copied from various sources formulas that appealed to me. There wasn't any logical common denominator; they appealed to me when I saw them. And the fact that that was already when I was in high school is remarkable.
I see. Here we have, for example, range of stations.
Yes. And that probably came from Bureau of Standards publications, which I became familiar with in the early college years. There were a few people now and then jotted down a simple formula like a range of transmission that was more or less valid. When I saw one, I copied it down.
Is this something that you used a lot?
Some. Most of these were beyond my needs.
Did you continue to use this after your college years?
When I learned more about the subject, those became largely obsolete.
Since there wasn't such a handbook that you could buy, you compiled one.
Yes. So let's see what happened in the area of handbooks. Professor Terman is one of the most remarkable of all members of our profession. He died rather recently. He published the best textbook for radio engineering in the early 'thirties. His name was immediately famous. In the middle 'thirties he published a very comprehensive book on radio measurements. Then he decided to make a handbook. He collected material for this handbook from the middle 'thirties until it was published, I believe, in 1941. But in collecting material, he didn't sit at his desk and read magazines. He went to visit the people who were working on the subject. He was on the West Coast, and I was on the East Coast. But he heard of the work being done at our Bayside laboratory, so in 1935 he arranged to pay me a visit to see what we were doing, and we were always glad to show it. So I met him at the Bayside station. And I saw someone I thought was Professor Terman, but he didn't seem to be paying any attention to me. But I approached him, and it turned out it was, and I was who he was looking for. In later years he told me that the reason he didn't contact me quicker was he was expecting an elderly man with a beard.
Because you'd been a name in the field for some years.
I was 32. We were immediately attracted to each other, and I visited him off and on, too, as long as he was working at Stanford. Well, the first real inspired radio handbook was his handbook published in 1941.
There were earlier ones?
Of a sort. They were not what I would call inspired. But they were of some use. But the handbook he published in 1941 became the bible of radio engineers during the war. His publishing company timorously released a lot of — I think — 10,000 volumes and never thought they'd get rid of them. And the day after the war started, they released another order for 10,000 because all the agencies working on war work were relying on this handbook. He told me how many were published once, but I've forgotten the number; it was near a hundred thousand. And this was an expensive book in an expensive binding.
Did you make a lot of use of that book yourself?
Yes. And a lot of contributions to it. On his visit to me, he told me what he was trying to do, so I released many of our reports that were unpublished for him to include in his handbook. So if you look at the references in the back of the book, I'm the one who has the greatest number of pages of references.
Oh, I see. There's some design curves in the endpapers of the book I can see.
Yes. He was inspired when it came to presenting the subject. Under my name there are two rows of numbers of pages where my articles were abstracted in his book.
How long was this in print? Do you know?
I wouldn't be surprised if it still is. I don't know, but it may have been reproduced in paperback.
Then soon after the war Federal Telegraph, which became IT&T, they had some brilliant engineers, and they were motivated to start an accumulated handbook. So they published the first small edition of the Federal IT&T Handbook. I have in my hand a rather thin handbook but not all that small, which says "Reference Data For Radio Engineers by Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation." It has my name engraved on the front, and it was presented to me by Haraden Pratt, the head of their laboratories, who was very prominent in IRE in those days. We became very good friends.
Did you contribute also a good deal to this?
Not overtly. I think it has perhaps a few things taken from my articles but not many. That was a very good start on their project, and it was difficult affording the effort it took for a profit-motivated company to develop this kind of information. But in some degree they found that it was paying off by making their own engineering more efficient. And I think that might have been the motivation in Federal as they had experience with it.
Was this also used at Hazeltine?
Yes. Everybody became familiar with it, and this project has continued over the years. Terman's handbook was a one-shot proposition. Federal's came out in the war in 1943. The fourth edition came out in '49. And incidentally, it's remarkable that this progress was mostly made during the war.
So it went through four editions in that decade the fourth edition in 1949 and the first in '43.
Yes. Then in recent years there have been several subsequent editions so it's not Webster's Dictionary status. But it was motivated by a few people who were active and perceptive like Haraden Pratt. He was one of the giants of the early engineering profession. IT&T was different in that their activities were based over a wide international base rather than just the United States. And some of their engineers were Frenchmen. That, I believe, is the only handbook that has continued to be built over the years, that went through the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and from ordinary waves to microwaves.
You've raised an issue that I wanted to ask about, and that is in the pre-World War II period whether, in your experience, engineering science and practice had a large input from outside the United States.
That does not have a simple answer. First, it started with Hertz, who was outside. And I was very sorry I couldn't accept an invitation to deliver one of the invited speeches at his 100th anniversary. He wasn't there at the time. And the French were probably ahead of us at the time of World War I, and of course Marconi was Italian. The Germans up until World War II were consistently leaders in engineering of all kinds.
I'm wondering, for example, whether you or others at Hazeltine read German articles.
First, I should have been proficient in German when I was studying for the Ph.D. Did I mention that the government in its infinitesimal wisdom [Chuckling] outlawed German during World War I? So I didn't get it in high school like I was supposed to. Anyway, the German developments in later years were largely transported into the English literature.
In the form of direct translations — or less direct?
Yes, either direct translations or the equivalent. And the language difference there was unfortunate because the Germans were leaders in so many things before Hitler destroyed the nation.
What about English radio engineering?
There was, of course, affiliation. It's interesting that the first electrical engineering society in this country was called the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. When IRE came along, they called it The Institute of Radio Engineers. And while it was started in this country, it has solicited members all over the world. The British had a separate organization, which was national called the Institution of Electrical Engineers, of which I am also a member. The IRE was probably one of the first world-based organizations, and with that circumstance the monthly meeting of the IRE in New York City in the 'twenties when I was developing was really a world meeting of radio engineers. And at those meetings I heard personally Marconi and others whose names I don't recall right away. Worldwide figures. And while I was going to school in Washington, working with the company part time, I seldom missed the monthly meeting in New York.
Would you make a trip — I suppose it wasn't just for the meeting because you had other work.
Usually I would arrange so that I spent two or three days working at the laboratory at the same time.
But you definitely made a point of trying to attend IRE meetings.
Incidentally, the paper I published on automatic volume control incidentally — which is about three pages — was sandwiched between two monumental papers by famous authors. I think one was Marconi and the other was Armstrong — something like that. And they were long papers that had less permanent implications.
I should mention sometime that I have come to evaluate inventions as to one category that I say are timeless and another category that are transient. In general you can say that an invention typically is aimed at solving a problem. Some inventions are makeshift solutions and have a short life. The Hazeltine neutralizing invention was a perfect example; it was very active for five years, and then the screen grid tube came along and removed the problem. The diode AVC invention is going strong today sixty years afterwards and survived the transition to transistors. I rate that as a timeless invention. So when you're thinking about an invention, that’s a very interesting question. Armstrong, for example, his first invention that made him famous was the regenerative receiver. Have you ever operated one?
No, I haven't.
It's an experience, because you can tickle it with a coil — and they called it tickler — to the point of very high sensitivity by critical adjustment. That was the prevalent radio receiver before the heterodyne came along. And if the RCA had licensed under Armstrong's invention, the heterodyne receiver probably wouldn't have been designed. Then the most radical of Armstrong's inventions was what he called super-regenerations. And you've seen some papers of mine on that subject. That was a typical Armstrong invention; he more or less accidentally came to observe some conditions of extreme sensitivity. And he perceived why it was and made receivers using that principle such that in those days a loop receiver would receive transcontinental stations with one or two tubes. But it had very serious deficiencies. So it never achieved wide service with the one exception of IFF during the war that I worked on.
Then his second major invention was the super heterodyne, which he invented in France. That appears to be a timeless invention. I don't see any trends away from the super heterodyne receiver. So he had in one career, both. Not only the FM service that he was completely responsible for. That seems to me to be a timeless service, whether you call it an invention is a question that's been argued no end.
What you're saying is that if one looks at the distribution of longevity of inventions, that there is bimodality.
Yes, they're two pretty definite categories. When I was thinking about these things, I thought of the zipper. That seems to be something that won't ever come out of style.
It may be that Velcro someday will displace it entirely.
Probably they'll supplement each other.
But it's certainly lasted a long time. An invention may meet a need that is specific to the time context.
Usually it means it's not a real solution to a problem. That is, usually the invention that dies a natural death is one, which is not a real solution to a problem. The Hazeltine neutralization was one example. The real solution came to be the screen-grid tube. That is the most common temporal restriction on inventions.
It may be that in the realm of possible inventions that there are best ones, or ones that are hard to improve on.
Yes. You naturally think of Xerox. If anything was an invention that is one. And while it's not the same today as it was when it was introduced, the sample principle seems very long-lived.
To return to your inventions, may I ask how widely used these charts were that you had published?
It's hard to quantify. After we reprinted them and distributed them more or less to anyone who wanted them — to all of our engineers — the engineers who had use for them made a lot of use. Many engineers weren't confronted with the same kind of a problem.
In 1956 you published a design of a vertical antenna made of transposed sections of coaxial cable.
Every topic has a story behind it. Wheeler Laboratories engaged in work on engineering problems for various companies. One little company in New Jersey came to us with several problems. One of them was that they wanted a vertical array of linear antennas for base stations in the moderately high frequency ranges. There was a problem making a vertical array of antennas because the transmission lines feeding the antennas for the higher ones would interfere with the lower ones. So I devised a construction that enabled the upper antennas to be fed through the lower antennas, so that there was no interference in the radiation. What I did was rather simple but, I would say, not obvious. So we designed vertical arrays of up to eight or so dipoles fed from one end all in line. It was something that just wasn't available. And this company named it the Stationmaster antenna for use at base stations. They had two different models for different frequency ranges. Some years ago they clocked a quarter of a million sales, and everywhere I go around I'll see one of these antennas on these stations and public works.
You introduced that type of antenna. What was the involvement of Wheeler Labs with that company?
Well, they got us to design some products that they wanted to. This was one of them. We just charged our usual engineering fee. We did not get a royalty or anything. Naturally they wanted to patent it — wanted us to patent it — so as to protect them from competition. That leads to another interesting story.
This antenna in its basic concept was invented a year earlier by a famous television engineer in England. They had vertical polarization, so they were interested in this thing. But he used air dielectric inside; it did not become immediately obvious how that was good or bad. I used dielectric cables for the construction of the antenna; and when we filed our patent application, by that time the British patent had been issued in the United States and Britain. So the examiner said they were the same thing and denied our claims. Then we did a deeper study and discovered by experiment that the British antenna without dielectric in it wouldn't work. The secret of our success was that we had dielectric-filled cables for the antenna. So we made a test to prove that, showed the test to the examiner, he ignored them. He said they were the same thing, and he denied our claim. What did he think he was? The Supreme Court? That was one of the few cases in which I've been the victim of arbitrary action by patent examiners.
What recourse do you have in that situation?
Theoretically to the courts, but the courts had been so antagonistic that was not a real remedy. So we let it go with commercial competition. Another company did copy these, but our client company fared very well.
You didn't have to pay royalties to the British inventor.
No. I guess because his invention expired in the time that these were becoming widely used. And also I might guess they just didn't bother. But you might say that his claims of earlier date should have entitled him to royalties. Then you might say he didn't make the invention because his didn't work. It was a great success, and it was a real invention.
And your work was independent of the work of the Englishman, is that right?
Yes. I never heard of that until I saw a copy of his patent, which was after I'd made the invention.
The next on the list is a 1958 study of Maxwell's spherical coil as an inductor shield or antenna.
That was largely an exercise in collecting the various properties of that particular kind of a coil. A spherical coil is not easy to make so it has been used very little. So this was largely a paper of academic interest except that it led to inferences as to how big you had to make some things and how some things work. So it was very interesting and involved a lot of concepts, which were new. Maxwell's spherical coil was the only kind of a coil that had a simple formula for its inductance. Incidentally, the reason is that the field inside of a spherical coil is uniform. That appealed to Maxwell, and he wrote the formula. For that reason it appealed to me also. But he never thought of using his coil, for example, as a shield for a smaller coil. And it turns out it would have been a very good shield. Of course it turns out it was better to use a solid sphere, but that's a different question. The use of a spherical coil as an antenna: It wasn't easy to make so nobody would normally do that. But in my theories of a small antenna, that became one of the textbook examples of a small antenna. So I had many collateral interests in this subject and I put them all in one package that was very interesting for its implications even if you didn't use it for design.
Did this paper attract any attention?
Not much. Mostly it was a useful reference in my articles about spherical antennas. And incidentally it was passed by the reviewers very generously at a time when that amount of space was in short supply. Of course it was 1958. The IRE lost its name in '63, just shortly before.
In '61 you published a new concept of radio propagation in the earth's crust. How did you come to be thinking about radio propagation in the crust?
Another subject that we'll probably be talking about is my work on what's called VLF propagation in antennas. That's very low frequency — an arbitrary designation of a low-frequency range from 3 kilohertz to 30 kilohertz. It's used very little in radio because the longer waves require large antennas for efficient radiation. And so at some point I'll be talking about the very large antennas on which I was a consultant.
It happened because I was thinking about low frequencies, and I was working on large antennas, where the ground was one electrode of the antenna, and studying the ground. In that connection, what I learned about the earth suggested to me that there was available in the earth's crust, parallel plate waveguides. First the top layer is conductive because of moisture. Then there's a layer where the moisture is forced out, and it's almost pure silica, which is nonconductive — pretty good insulator. Then below that the high temperature of the silica made it a conductor again.
So I was the first one to perceive that there was in the earths crust a parallel plate waveguide. I presented that at a VLF Conference in Boulder, Colorado, around 1950. You could hear a pin drop [Chuckling] when I pointed out that there was probably a channel for radio waves to go long distances in the earth's crust and then come out deep in the ocean, because we had found no method of getting radio waves to a submarine deeply submerged. So what happened: they clamped a secrecy order on my patent after the paper had been published. The patent didn't issue until 20 years later. The Navy has a project, which is exploring that possibility in recent years. Did you ever hear of what's called the ELF Project in the Navy? The initials stand for Extra Low Frequency, meaning frequencies below 3 kilohertz. And most people who refer to it don't know that. I don't think it'll work very well.
It's a current project?
The Navy has spent millions of dollars in the past one or two decades exploring the possibilities on the basis of my 1950 paper.
You published an article on a logical date code, which I've gotten to know in your writings. What started you in that work?
Well, first, that's one of my greatest contributions and the slowest to be adopted. Sometime before World War II a friend of mine for a short time used what I call the "logical date code," a six-digit code for writing the year, month and day as one number. I took note of it but I didn't pay much attention to it until after the war when I was starting my independent operation. In patent practices dates become extremely important, so that among other things motivated me to adopt a way of writing the date that was efficient and logical. And then I came to appreciate the extreme confusion in writing dates in every form except what I perceived was the one logical form. The French would write a date with the day and then the month and then the year, which is putting the smallest thing before the largest. And when you're writing the date with the day, they would put the tens before the ones, which was the largest before the smallest.
So it had no semblance of logic. And that's what I perceived and decided that my way of writing the date code was the only logical way. I dreamed that it might prevail. Well, everybody fought it almost everybody, or for years except in my laboratory we used it consistently. And my engineers came to like it. But they were mostly shot down when they went to other companies. Just now it's approaching its ascendancy. The prevalent ways of writing the date are so many and so confused that people are beginning to appreciate the need for a unified logical order. And then with the computer, that was the order where you could catalog dates numerically. In my article I point out that this numerical representation is not the only logical one; it would be logical also to say: 1931 July 27. That meets all the requirements of my logic. So I sometimes use that plan in correspondence where the other party would not recognize my date code. That is at least a substitute that is not susceptible of misinterpretation.
That is an example of how I've always tried to perceive an orderly or logical approach where there was one. And here, you might say, nobody ahead of me had perceived that there was one.
And you say that in recent years in the data-processing world this is becoming fairly common?
Yes. You might be interested; there were numerous unrelated examples where somebody came to appreciate it. In getting a money order recently, I discovered that the post office had written the date in my code. So I wrote to the Postmaster General and asked him — I said I'd be interested in knowing the name of the man who made that decision. And he said — I got a nice reply, a personal reply from one of his staff. Said they'd be interested, too, but they'd lost track of him. It was maybe 17 years ago, and they didn't know who did it. All they knew was that for 17 years money orders had been using that code. I didn't even know that. My article was in Journal of Industrial Engineering, which very few people see.
After the war, I might say in general terms, my specialization became antennas and microwaves and strip lines. Strip lines were closely related to microwave waveguides. And antennas, of course, galloped off in all directions. I specialized in some directions.
First, during that decade, by far the greatest part of our work was brought to us from Bell Laboratories in Whippany. The first projects were simple introductory exercises. One was the microwave X-band plumbing for the NIKE missile, which was the first guided missile engineered by Bell Laboratories. It was a ground-to-air guided missile. Rather primitive by today's standards but very well planned and well executed. Well, our first work on the microwave circuits gave us introduction to that frequency band. The next was to design an antenna feed — a feed for a lens-type antenna for that system — the so-called monopulse feed, which was a type of guidance for guided missiles.
That worked well, so their next project, which was called NIKE Hercules, was in a lower frequency band. I guess it was called the C-band. It had much larger antennas, more power, and higher range. On that project we did much of the microwave design work, including the antenna. The antenna was one of the jewels of our experience because it had such inspired leadership from Whippany. We were able to respond in a way that was very effective. The net result was that we invented a new type of reflector antenna — a double reflector antenna — which was used in the Hercules system. When I say we designed it, essentially we did the design innovation and experiments, and it was made by Goodyear for Bell Telephone Laboratories. Incidentally, that antenna is still in use today for instrumentation of some radar ranges. It was the star antenna of the guided missile field in its day. And then came the days of anti-ballistic missile radar, and that introduced a whole new family of antennas including the phased array. Are you familiar with the concept of a phased array?
Generally.
Essentially it is a large array of small radiators, and a beam is formed by phasing all the radiators to steer it in any direction you want. Instead of steering a mechanical device, the steering could be done rapidly in electronic circuits.
What's the origin of that technology?
During the war a few of the Signal Corps and Navy radar antennas were arrays that we would have said had a large number of elements. A large number in those days meant maybe 3 by 8 or something like that. Those arrays were designed from very primitive rules. They served their purpose, but they were not phased arrays; they were mechanically steered. One, incidentally, was the radar that they ignored at Pearl Harbor. But these Signal Corps radars soon had one of my IFF antennas mounted on top. And it was associated with the IFF equipment we designed for them. With regard to the phased array, some people — very few, I think — began thinking in terms of electrical steering of the arrayed beam. One was one of our leading engineers — Arthur Loughren — who is retired and lives in Hawaii right now. He invented one kind of steering circuit called a frequency steering. That was not used very much. One of the leaders in the Hughes Radar Group later invented the same thing, and Hughes made just a few of these frequency-steered phased arrays. The significance in our program was that our patent was issued just about the time they were making the last one, and we got royalties on the last one, after which they went out of style. I might mention that the inventor of that — named Begovich — was one of the stars in the Hughes Engineering organization that was becoming one of the most prominent in the world. So just after the war I became interested in the crude arrays that had been made and in the design problems. That led to one of my principal innovations.
I published a paper proposing that the ray element he designed by a technique that treated it as an element of an infinite array, that was one of the many concepts that the engineer at the bench was not attracted to. The idea of an infinite array was not natural. It happened that it was closely related to the behavior in waveguides where an infinite array of images was produced by inner walls. So in 1948 I published the first paper that was written about designing an array element as an element of an infinite array. It did not immediately attract much attention.
Were there other groups working on phased arrays at the time?
Yes. The real intensive activity on electronic steering hadn't yet matured. But in the next few years it became one of the primary activities in the field of guided missiles and radar. So gradually the workers in the field embraced the concept of a phased array. One of the Hazeltine leaders sort of independently worked on it a little later. And that was the beginning of the scientific design of array elements in the next two or three decades. It wasn't long after that when Bell Laboratories came to us with their problems in phased arrays; and as you can imagine, a big array of hundreds and thousands of elements was not something you managed in a small laboratory. They managed it though, and they brought to us the problems that we could work on most effectively. One was the design of an array element suitable for a large array, which we designed on the principle of the infinite array.
What was it that made you particularly interested in arrays?
I was unhappy with the crude method of design of the small arrays that were in use during the war. They were, as you can imagine, sensible engineering designs — General Electric, Bell Telephone Laboratories, the Naval Research Laboratory. But they were crude, and they couldn't accurately predict the behavior of a radiating element in a moderately large number of others. So I was dissatisfied with what I saw.
Tell me a bit about publication of results and patenting of results?
You might read between the lines that they couldn't hold me down. [Chuckling] Not that anyone tried to, but the routine supervision of projects that we had were just a springboard from which I got all kinds of ideas. And I was free to publish — more free, you might say — than if I'd been in a large organization. And I was more able to than if I had had no organization at all. So that accounts for the rather large number of publications attributed to me in the next couple of decades. But mainly when I saw a problem, I was motivated to explore the nature of the problem and find a solution.
What about the patenting of the results of these concepts?
First of all the concept of an infinite array had no patent status. That was true of about half of my publications. We were not relying on patent royalties, but my prior experience placed some emphasis on patents. Bell Laboratories were interested in having some things patented. That was not a major impetus in the period after the war.
You would seek patents perhaps to protect yourselves as much as to gain royalties?
We did it just because it was considered the thing to do. I had been disillusioned on the value of patents but I still recognized that the patent system was a very active medium for disseminating new ideas. Also it was encouragement to my engineers when they were able to obtain patents.
But the patents would be held by Wheeler Laboratories?
When we were working for another company, that company was the assignee and the owner.
And Bell Labs sometimes asked you to patent a certain thing.
Yes. The outstanding antenna that I mentioned was the subject of a patent to one of our brightest young engineers, who, incidentally, is still in the laboratories, and someone that I recruited from Stevens; he was a student of Professor Hazeltine.
How was this long series of Wheeler Labs reports, distributed?
First, we made a practice of adequate reporting of our current activities and results. That was one of the things that impressed our contacts at Bell Telephone Laboratories. So we developed an unusual technique for planning and preparing reports, which was a little laborious but yielded an excellent result. By and large our engineers welcomed the training and profited by it.
How did you encourage the people to write up work? It was understood that whoever worked on a project would also write it up.
All of us — including myself — started from a very rudimentary base in writing reports in our early days. But we managed to get the engineers to work together in a way that motivated the group and the individual. It accomplished two ends: Our clients were delighted with our reports and the quality of them, and our engineers became known by signing the reports.
Were these reports made available to anyone who wanted them?
No. Just to our clients.
Were they eventually circulated more widely?
No. Usually they went to an ad hoc requirement of a specific group.
Weren't the Wheeler Monographs coming out during that same time?
Yes. It was in this period and about the time that I was writing about the infinite array that I made several studies, which would require a rather lengthy paper to present adequately. The IRE didn't have the capacity for publishing lengthy papers but so I didn't let that stop me writing the papers. Then I thought: how could this knowledge be disseminated in a way that would be a credit to me and a contribution to the profession. Well, I had thought of approaching some large laboratories to subscribe to a series of monographs at a very nominal fee. My friends welcomed the opportunity, so that several large companies automatically received the monographs as they came out and circulated them among their groups. That proved to be a very effective way of utilizing these studies I was making. After a few years the subscription fee became trivial, and we distributed them free of charge to our original friends and also others who were interested.
About the same time, the Rad Lab series of books was coming out. Was that something that made a big difference to Wheeler Laboratories? Did you use those much as sources?
Several of the volumes were directly related to the work that we had specialized in during the war and soon after. Those became textbooks and handbooks to everyone in the field. It was one of the most ambitious and most productive publication efforts in history. Anyway, it's interesting that in the fields where I had specialized, the Rad Lab reports were sometimes primitive. They had different problems, and in some areas they had advanced as far as we had. But of course I'm not talking about some years later than their actual work. There's no question their actual work was pioneering at the time it was done.
Did you like heading your own laboratories as opposed to working at Hazeltine?
I liked the freedom of making decisions without any restrictions outside of my own providence. It was a new experience. I involved my engineers in management of our activities rather than financial management. That developed them very well. It was a miracle in providing opportunities and a degree of freedom with a minimum of counterproductive restrictions because of the fact that Bell Laboratories was a leader in the field, and they could obtain support from the government in a way that no other organization could. That support included our work.
When did Wheeler Labs approach 100 engineers?
In 1959. The 'fifties was a period that we'll never see again and never saw before, when the Pentagon was spending all the money they could on innovation. That wasn't the name of the game in the government generally. But that period after the war, which meant especially the early days of guided missiles, was a period unprecedented and that'll never happen again. So that was a fertile field for innovation. But then at the end of that decade in 1959 happened what you wouldn't have thought possible. The Air Force sent a letter to the contractors, which said money was getting scarce, and they couldn't expect to be paid on time.
Well, that was one of many events, which started to inhibit the full range of innovative activity. It among other things reduced the Bell Laboratories load to a point where they gradually had less need for our services. I might say that from some viewpoint their contracting our services should have been frowned on by their organization because essentially they were building up engineering talent to compete with their own group. But in the climate of the 'fifties, that was not an important consideration. Later on the people who had introduced us in their group became less involved — either higher management positions or retirement. The successor group was less personally involved in our activities, and the work for them was tapering off.
It was just at that time that MacDonald came over to see me. He said, "Shouldn't we get together again?" Well, the circumstances left me receptive to that approach so Hazeltine acquired our company at a nominal price in stock and very thoughtfully continued our activities for another decade, semi-independent. We still operated under our name, and we still had opportunities for contracts with various other organizations.
So it continued administratively separate?
Yes. But management of our laboratory was no big deal compared with the large company. We also naturally had Hazeltine as a client. So several of their problems we tackled during that decade.
You didn't have them as a client before '59?
I also wondered if maybe it was frustrating for you as Wheeler Labs became larger and larger to have to spend more and more time as manager and less time with engineering work. Is that the case?
No. I was very fortunate in that our contacts with Bell Telephone Laboratories brought us in direct contact with their contracting leaders. Essentially they relieved us of the burden of obtaining contracts and managing the government interface, which was not inspired during that period.
What about the work for Raytheon that Wheeler Labs did?
I think that originated in the late 'fifties and built up during the 'sixties. They probably came to us because they became aware of our work for Bell Telephone Laboratories and perceived that they had some similar problems. Perhaps they were understaffed for the amount of ambitious work they were undertaking. During that period we designed for them a phased-array element for the radar for the "SAM D," Surface-to-Air Missile Project. That's what matured into the Patriot during the war, and one of our engineers and some of our designs of that period were active in the Patriot development.
Was that a large contract?
Not compared to our work for Bell Laboratories. It might have occupied a few of our engineers for a period of a few years. It was not minor. There again our contacts with Raytheon were very productive. It didn't hurt that I was a personal friend of Tom Phillips, who became the head of Raytheon, from getting acquainted with him in the early days of guided missiles when he was working at the bench. He is one of the inspired engineers and leaders of all history.
What type of work did Wheeler Labs do with Communications Products?
Communications Products was a small company in New Jersey whose primary product was antennas and transmission lines related to antennas. They became acquainted with some of our work. Their engineer who was a very bright amateur and very active leader came to us with several problems, which were of varying importance. One, for example, was method of testing transmission lines where the requirements were becoming increasingly severe. So they brought to us this ambition of theirs to make a vertical array of vertical dipoles to provide omni directional coverage with radiation gain, meaning the radiation concentrated toward the horizon, and one that was suitable for base stations. That is what led to my invention and our development of their most famous antenna, which was dubbed the Stationmaster.
What was this antenna used for?
It was used for base stations in the moderately high frequency ranges. Roughly the same ranges as used by amateurs. The chief engineer was an active amateur. And so this design was inspired — if any design ever was. We ended up in a very short time with a design that was very effective.
Did you actually test it with a physical model?
Yes we used our latest concepts of array design, which were required only in a small degree in that small antenna, but were very helpful. We gave them this design, and they exceeded their fondest expectations in economy of production and in performance. They wanted to patent it naturally, and we had no objections. So the patent application proceeded through channels, and the examiner called to our attention a similar vertical array in the slightly earlier invention by a famous British inventor named Blumlein. Many of his inventions were my inventions a year earlier because the British had a head start in TV. So the examiner said we didn't have any invention over that. Our first reaction was to agree with him; on further study however it turned out that Blumlein's invention used air dielectric in the coaxial lines, which fed the power through the lower into the higher dipoles. And ours used a dielectric cable. Well, as we began to make experiments, we discovered that ours worked, and his didn't. There was a basic deficiency in his design that was corrected by our design. We made conclusive tests, showed the tests to the examiner, and he ignored them and refused to issue a patent on ours.
What is the usual procedure there? For example, if someone has, let's say, basically the design that will work but misses some crucial point, is he generally accorded the patent anyway?
Well, nobody knew that Blumlein's paper patent wouldn't work. So it was presumptive — that the competence of its preparation and the competence of the inventor was presumptive — that it would work.
But working models are not required?
One might argue that although but a lot of things would be corrected, in the process of implementing on invention the patent is valid nonetheless.
Assuming that the thing described in the patent would work, then the inventor is allowed quite a little leeway in interpreting the applications of it. It's very seldom that you have a clear case as we had here, where we built the basic invention according to the patent, and it didn't work.
But the examiner wasn't impressed. He had issued the Blumlein patent and he didn't accept our proof that it wouldn't work, and he didn't accept our proof that we had a patentable improvement. Which would have been clear to anyone else except him. We did not pursue that conflict because it would have been more expensive than we chose to afford. And we meaning both ourselves and the manufacturer.
At the time of the outbreak of World War II in September of '39, your principal activity then was the development of television?
Was it that Hazeltine became involved in wartime work or military work?
As the war activity became more active in Europe, it became apparent that the U.S. would become involved before long. Government agencies were established to initiate activity and development toward this end. About that time, materials for civilian radio manufacture were curtailed so that our management began exploring opportunities, which the company might have toward war work. There was a short period of a year or two when they were mainly development activities sponsored by government agencies like National Defense Research Committee NDRC and its successor, Office of Scientific Research and Development, OSRD.
Had Hazeltine had any previous contact with the military?
Very little. Nothing that materialized, really. So we became acquainted in some committees — or some subgroups — of those activities. That led to contracts for a few military projects. By all tests, the most important one was the mine detector, the detector for buried metallic mines, an anti-tank weapon. And we were selected as the one organization to develop that device.
What sort of mine detectors were already available?
None in the military, but the so-called treasure-finders, which were very similar and were used by bounty hunters for buried wrecks and on the beach. So we explored the existing technology in that field — not too efficiently, I might say — but we kept in close contact with our NDRC advisors. The principal one was Dr. Molnar, who later became an officer of Bell Telephone Laboratories. He was at MIT, and he steered us into a less ambitious program of making a practical design of an existing treasure-finder.
The treasure-finder was some coils on a long pole, and the coupling between the coils had to be critically balanced out in order to detect the reaction of a buried metal object. Their principal defect was that the balancing was so critical that even exposure to daylight would cause expansion and upset the balance. So I tackled that problem in order to develop a practical design on the same principles. I invented a triple-coil assembly.
The others were double coil?
The others were just two coils, which were either concentric or offset. In the triple-coil assembly — the inner and outer coil was the transmitter, and the intermediate coil was the receiver. The balance with it was obtained by the geometric relations among the coils, which happened to be very simple. So we designed this triple-coil assembly, and true to prediction, it was entirely insensitive to heating in the balance and became practical.
Was there any of your previous work that had been at all similar?
Not really. We were floundering, I would say, among various options, and we hadn't got to the point of something that looked like a practical design when Molnar urged us to concentrate our effort on something that existed which, was very wise counsel. In a very short time this design was made into a highly effective mechanical assembly. In this work my engineer in charge was an older engineer named Leslie Curtis. And to him goes credit for the inspired mechanical design of this assembly, and much of the credit for the amplifier and controls that enabled it to be practical. About the time this was maturing was the campaign in Africa. So we rushed to completion one working model, which was flown to Africa and immediately put in service in the anti-tank operations. From that time on it was soon in quantity production and was used widely in Italy and in France.
You mentioned in your book that another company got the contract with the quantity production.
Yes. The Signal Corps supervisor of this work was a captain who had been with the Horni Company, which made traffic signals. And in a phony competitive bid, the job went to his company and not to us. I might say the company did a good job, but it was kind of sad because they would call us up when they had problems, and we couldn't talk to them because it was secret. But that mine detector was a great success and was still in use in Korea, and the Signal Corps didn't have any other versatile mine detector. It went out of style with the advent of plastic mines. And to this day we have no good way of detecting plastic mines.
Did your involvement with that end when the contract went to the other company?
Except that the Horni Company would call and ask for help.
Yes, and we pursued some avenues directed toward a more elaborate and improved design, but nothing useful came of it.
Was that Hazeltine's own initiative or under contract?
Under contract. Continuation of the same NDRC and OSRD committees.
What was the next major wartime project?
There wasn't anything else really significant before the war. There were some very interesting experiments. One particularly interesting was a television-guided bomb. The first exploration of that possibility. We made crude demonstrations that were very convincing, and that was the beginning of the television-guided missiles which the U.S. acquired many years later. The other jobs were small jobs that were inconsequential until the war increased in intensity.
The British were then developing radar. And as we know, that saved their lives in the Battle of Britain. And that brought to their attention the need for identification of a radar target so you know shoot or don't shoot. So a very inspired group in Britain under Sir Robert Watson-Watt developed what they called IFF, interrogation Friend or Foe. The first model, called Mark I, went into use, and the second model, called Mark II, and was some improvement. Both one satisfied them, and they developed a third model called Mark III. And Mark III's principle was an interrogator signal similar to radar but separate from the radar, which triggered a response in the target aircraft if it was friendly. That's what gave it the name "Interrogation Friend or Foe." So in England they faced the dilemma that they had an inspired design in the experimental stage and were fresh out of talent for further design and manufacture. That was the time when U.S. had a contract with the British for work anticipating war activity.
Was this before Pearl Harbor?
Yes, shortly before. So our chief engineer, MacDonald, was exploring possibilities, and he became acquainted with some of the leaders in the Navy. And they identified this project as one that Hazeltine was uniquely qualified to undertake. Meaning that we had engineering talent — one of the best radio engineering groups in the country — which was available. And we had license manufacturers who were now idle who were uniquely qualified for making this kind of equipment. So he negotiated. Well, first we had some dealings with the Signal Corps. Then he negotiated with the Navy a prime contract for Hazeltine to undertake the design and production of all the IFF equipment the Navy needed. That became our war project to the exclusion of everything else.
When did that start?
The contract was negotiated just before Pearl Harbor and signed quickly — like a few days later. [Chuckling]
What contacts did you have with Rad Lab?
Very little. There were a few occasions when they wanted an IFF system uniquely adapted to one of their radars. So we went to Rad Lab and visited Navy vessels to adapt that equipment to their needs.
So the IFF system that you were working on before that was for pre-existing Navy radars?
It was adapted to whatever radars were contemporary. It's interesting that the first test war by the Signal Corps with the old SCR-268 radar, whose purpose was to identify a target so that they could steer a sound detector to locate it accurately. To the extent that that radar was used for a while, it had our IFF equipment on it. But our dealings with the Signal Corps were less than satisfactory because they still had the old-fashioned notions of contracting and competitive bidding, which were not well adapted for that project. So the preliminary designs we made for the Signal Corps were copied by their contractors during the war. And they continued to use our first-generation designs while we made a much-improved second-generation design that was used by the Navy.
The difference is that the Signal Corps would insist on each project being put out to bids?
Sort of. The important thing was that they held the management close to the vest with all the limitations of government contracting; whereas the Navy had the foresight and the freedom to give us a great deal of freedom which enabled efficient design and manufacture. So that that was one of the star projects during the war.
And was that a series of devices, IFF devices?
Yes. What I call the second-generation designs for the ordinary IFF equipment were the main part of that project. The second-generation design involved major improvements in the circuit equipment and particularly the high-frequency technology, which was not too familiar yet. The frequency range of that system was 157 to 187 megahertz. That was one of the frequency ranges that was just maturing at that time. So we had to become expert in this new frequency range. With that came a whole new list of antennas required. My limited exposure to antennas in the middle 'thirties gave me a very good springboard to tackle these antenna problems. So I set up an antenna group in a shack near our company headquarters in Little Neck. And that was one of the most famous groups in the view of the Navy during the war. So three or four bright young engineers in my antenna group were responsible for one after another-innovative antenna to meet specifically the needs of the Navy for IFF.
You would design an antenna for a particular ship or plane?
No. For types — one shipboard and one airborne, and for ground-based landing beacons. All of those things were involved. The largest quantity of equipment was the transponder, which was carried by potential targets; in the Navy that meant surface vessels, military and civilian, and all Navy aircraft. So at the end of the war our equipment and antenna designs were carried on every Navy potential target.
Aircraft and surface vessels?
Yes. Also submarines, since submarines when they surfaced were radar targets. I have a patent on each of maybe half a dozen different types of antennas for these specific purposes.
These patents, I'm guessing, were not applied outside of the Navy?
That is true. And because they were patents and not publications in the literature, they were not well known after the war. Some were too specific to have general application. Others were reinvented by other engineers after the war.
How large was this antenna group of yours?
Three or four engineers were typical.
Was this a fairly well understood branch of engineering science? That if you had certain requirements, you could calculate what sort of antenna would be best?
There were very few antenna experts in our industry. One reason was the largest quantity of equipment was home receivers, which did not use specialized antennas. So the specialists were in RCA Communications where they had very different requirements. So I was in a virgin field designing small antennas, meaning antennas you could carry around for specific purposes that did not exist before the war.
Were you hampered much in those years by classification of information?
Yes. It inhibited free communication between companies. But since our company had all the responsibility for this system, that was not a serious handicap.
So you couldn't typically call somebody at Bell Labs and ask if they had done something similar?
Typically their work was more or less published and directed in different directions that were not parallel to ours.
Well, that's perhaps a poorly chosen example. If you knew that at Rad Lab or Columbia related work had been done, could you contact those people and ask about it?
Mostly we just knew enough to know that the antennas needed for our requirement were not then common knowledge.
So the IFF and all this antenna work was the bulk of your wartime activity?
Yes. And we should say it was mostly IFF but included the early days of transponder beacons for plane landings.
How did things go then when the war came to an end for Hazeltine?
I should have mentioned that about the middle of the war our IFF system had been sort of compromised, and the need was recognized for a more advanced system. So in parallel with our immediate needs, a project was initiated by the Navy as a leader of all agencies, both in the government and civilian, to work on a successor IFF. After the Mark III there was one designated Mark IV that didn't go anywhere. The next was designated Mark V, and that is the one that was the subject of intensive developmental activity in the latter half of the war period.
The Mark V was developed under cognizance of the Naval Research Laboratory located in Washington, DC. That project involved cooperation of all the government military agencies and several companies with ambitions to manufacture the equipment. It was designated the Combined Research Group — CRG — with headquarters in a new building at the Naval Research Laboratory. I and our group spent a great deal of time on location. Our responsibility in the new project — the immediate responsibility — was to provide by quick reaction new equipment that they perceived they needed. And so we had a shuttle between our headquarters in Little Neck and NRL in support of that activity.
Who else was involved in CRG?
It was a very ambitious group. It involved representatives from England, some of whom had been involved in the original IFF. The principal government agencies and some subsidiary government groups and a number of manufacturers, including some of the most prominent manufacturers who were anxious to cooperate in the war effort and who were interested in having a part of the pie when it went into production.
Now this CRG design designated Mark V was mainly distinguished by a higher frequency band, the so-called L-band, around 1 megahertz. So that involved a new set of technical problems. In the antenna area and in the area of high frequency circuits, I was a leader. So I have some patents in that field. That project came to a screeching halt when the war was over, by which I mean the ambitious program was reduced to a holding operation. It shortly resulted in a new simplified IFF, which became the keystone of our postwar IFF equipment. It was designated Mark X.
You would naturally be curious what happened to the intervening numbers. One of the leaders in the government, Gene Fubini, was at the blackboard one day and talking about the next generation of equipment. He wrote down Mark X [the letter X, indicating an unknown number], and that was transcribed to Mark Ten.
So there were no VI, VII, VIII and IX?
None. And Hazeltine became the leader in both development and manufacture of Mark X and successor equipment. In the decades after the war there was one individual whom I hired just before the war, who had continual activity in our wartime IFF work and all the IFF work of the company until he retired a few years ago. And so that was the long-term story of IFF.
So that became a large part of Hazeltine's successive work?
Yes. It was one of two or three principal activities. And there wasn't any question that Hazeltine was the leader. But they encountered all kinds of nit picking in contracting and delays as we resumed civilian activities after the war. It was much less efficient.
Did you stay pretty much full time on that?
No. After the war when I left the company for a while, I was separated from that activity. And when I rejoined the company, I participated in some degree, but I was never immersed in it to the extent that I was during the war.
Was it in '46 that you left the company?
Yes. Shortly after VJ Day. I elected to pursue another kind of career for a while.
I'd like to hear about that decision of yours.
First, the opportunities for war work were outstanding, and none of us would have thought of breaking loose during the war. But the company had some limitations. MacDonald, the leader, was not an inspired manager of engineering talent, although he made excellent use of it during the war. A few of us perceived that the opportunities we'd had before the war and during the war might be curtailed after the war in favor of production management and engineering. That did happen. The chief engineer, Harnett, and myself embarked on separate paths at that time.
So he left the company at the same time?
For the same reason?
Sort of. He did not go into independent work. He found jobs in other large companies.
Why did you decide on the independent work?
I am not pretending that I had a plan. It was mainly negative, but I felt there should be opportunities better outside than I perceived in the near future of the company. And I was very well known, so once it got around that I was independent, the world beat a path to my door. [Chuckling]
So you didn't have trouble working as a consulting engineer.
No. I had very good opportunities. And I didn't aim to acquire a great financial gain, which was attractive to my clients. So that's what happened in the years after the war.
And when was it — in '47 — that you set up Wheeler Laboratories?
I should give you the background of that. When I broke loose in '46, various people came to me for consultation. One you'd least expect was Bell Telephone Laboratories. Their military center at Whippany, New Jersey, was overloaded by the avalanche of postwar military developments, largely in the new field of guided missiles. And so it just happened that the head of those laboratories was a close friend of mine from the first summer I worked with Professor Hazeltine. That was Robert Poole.
He was an instructor at that time, but shortly he went to the telephone company. And the Whippany Laboratory out in New Jersey was started as a field station for the development of the first scientifically designed broadcast transmitter. It was the first one that was water-cooled. I used to visit him out there. Then shortly before the war that was identified as the military center of Bell Telephone Laboratories and all their classified work. When he heard that I was free, he and his right-hand man gave me a call. Said they had more work than they could handle, and he gave me the choice of three topics for him to steer development work to my group. My group then was three people. That was the opportunity which mushroomed in the next decade and which gave my group and me an opportunity that would seldom be equaled in history, if ever.
Had a couple of engineers left Hazeltine with you?
After I was established in a base of operations, some inquired and others I solicited who might be interested in joining my staff. The end result was possibly half a dozen engineers from Hazeltine came to my staff. One became my chief engineer and the greatest moving spirit in our organization. That was David Dettinger. The others were very helpful. Shortly we started to recruit new graduates. Almost all of our engineers were new graduates who weren't yet spoiled by bad habits in other organizations.
Was that the hiring policy of Wheeler Laboratories?
Yes. We had recruiting and interviewing activities performed by our leading engineers, not by a personnel department. Every engineer who was interviewed by our group was impressed, thought he was really being tested. The brightest ones we hired. So that's the way we built up our staff to near a hundred engineers in a decade.
It was in '47 that you got a contract with Bell Labs, Whippany?
Yes. In '47 it became apparent to me and my attorney friend who was helping me that it would be desirable to incorporate, so we did.
What were the main reasons for that?
So that we would have an operating base to be more business-like than just doing it in my office. So it was done in my office, but it was done on an orderly basis from the beginning of 1947. And I didn't have any large staff, but I naturally had to have a small staff to run the business aspects.
Did that work grow very rapidly?
Yes. Bell Laboratories was simply delighted with the work we did on their first assignments. They were particularly impressed with the quality of our reports, which first I wrote and then I was joined by the other members of the staff. They were increasingly short of the amount of talent being called for. So they fed us additional projects as rapidly as we could assimilate. And they were just delighted with the work we did and gave us excellent support. The most important thing was that they subcontracted to us on contracts which were large projects and which we couldn't have tapped if it hadn't been through their management. So we enjoyed the luxury of having the primary management handled by Bell Laboratories, and we could devote almost all of our attention to creative work.
Let me ask you now about other consulting work that you did in the 1950's: the VLF antenna for DECO?
Before that the first consulting job that I look back on with some pride was a small one. My associate chief engineer was employed for a short time at Emerson Radio. They had a military contract for a proximity fuse for a small rocket. He was aware of my growing interest in small antennas, and they needed a very small antenna to put in the head of that missile. So he directed their engineer to me for help. Incidentally, that engineer later became a prominent engineer on the Hazeltine staff.
Seymour Berkoff. So he brought to me a very good prescription for their needs. An example of how their engineers were applying textbook rules to try and make a small antenna. I was just in the middle of my work on small antennas and small antenna theory, so I was able to tell them they should use a very much simpler design that would make better use of the space and be more efficient. They used a multi-turn loop antenna in the nose of the missile. That was a conventional approach to a small antenna. I designed one which was a single-turn loop made of wide strip and self-tuned — I mean, tuned at the terminals — which was very much more efficient than the multi-turn loop they had been using. So I immediately became famous in that area, and that was the first design that I made which profited from my studies of small antennas. So I was very much excited about it.
This was a case of your sort of general study of a type of antenna being applied.
Having an application, which was simply an ideal test of my theories. That we used on the missile. I don't have a good idea of what the subsequent history of the missile was. It was under supervision of a section of the National Bureau of Standards. So that was in itself a small project by any standards, but not trivial.
Then about that time a friend of mine from the Navy days during the war, Lester Carr, heard that I was available. His laboratory, Developmental Engineering Corporation, or DECO, located in Leesburg, Virginia, had the electrical design responsibility for the largest antenna the Navy had made. Incidentally, he and I soon recognized that as an example of a small antenna because it was small compared to the wavelength. He immediately engaged me to do a great deal of consulting work on the problems they were having related to this big antenna.
So what was the antenna for anyway? One of the problems of the Navy was long-range communication and communication to submarines, either surfaced or slightly under water. The properties of radio waves under water made it impossible to transmit a signal to any great depth in seawater. But the Navy was doing the best that was known by making high-powered, long-wave transmitters.
What depth could be reached?
A few meters. Nothing spectacular but useful. Incidentally, those stations provided worldwide coverage in code signals, which was generally useful. So the Navy was in the course of designing its largest antenna to date, which was to be located in Cutler, Maine. And that was chosen as the site in the zone of interior, which is closest to the North Sea, which is where we might be engaging Russian submarines.
Anyway, I worked very closely with this group of engineers who were very competent and well educated but not specialists in antennas. So collectively we soon became specialists in this type of antenna. Their design ended up with the largest antenna in the world, a grid of wires supported on thousand-foot towers covering about two square miles. The mechanical and electrical requirements of that antenna were beyond anything in experience. I might mention that previously the most efficient antenna for long waves had been an antenna that the Germans made during the war, which was remarkable in view of their problems of personnel and materials. We had knowledge of their antenna by that time. The Russians stole it immediately at the end of the war, took it to Russia.
Were there other examples of very advanced German work that you found out about after the war?
This was one of the extreme cases. I think other than this we would look to jet aircraft. If the war had lasted a year later, their jet aircraft would have defeated our aircraft. And the war would have stopped in their favor. It's interesting that the U.S. had been disinterested in jet propulsion. But that's a long story in itself. Those are the things that I think of anyway. And of course in guided missiles they had the V-1 and the V-2 before we had any guided missiles.
Would they qualify as guided missiles?
Yes! They weren't guided in the sense of steering to a target by signals reflected from the target. But they were guided by inertial guidance, which is one of the most prominent types of guidance used after the war for missiles and submarines. Those were the beginnings of guided missiles, and the V-2 is very similar to some of the most advanced guided missiles that you read about in the paper. It was supersonic — the first one, I guess. The V-1 was subsonic. And it was accurately steered by guidance to targets like London and other areas of special interest. It was a real problem at the end of the war, but it did not advance far enough to influence the course of the war. It's interesting that it had mobile launching sites like the scud. So that was another area where we had kidnapped the German engineers responsible and brought them over here.
But to go back to the VLF radio. Their station was no secret; you could hear it all over the world. And we were aware of it, but we were not aware of its design. So for this large antenna, I was the scientific consultant to their engineering group, and my function was to bring a scientific approach to areas, which had been textbook engineering. The result was quite effective. They were a competent engineering group, and I was able to work with them very effectively. That was, shall we say, exciting, to be working on that antenna. And we also worked with the construction contractor, which was Continental Electronics in Dallas, so I had close contact with them also. My principal contribution was translating the concepts of a small antenna to the practical application in this "small antenna," which was the biggest antenna in the world. It was commissioned late in the 'fifties.
Did it work up to expectations?
Yes. In some of the areas the Navy had been over-cautious, and the antenna was over-designed. It exceeded its design objective, which was remarkable at the time, of radiating one megawatt from a two-megawatt transmitter at a frequency as low as 15 kilohertz. The antenna was small compared with the wavelength, 20 km. Their solutions to several design problems were outstanding and were vindicated in the performance. After the war even this big antenna could only send very slow code signals, but it could be received with a pocket radio anywhere in the world.
That initial design was then taken to the next stage of development. VLF signals, as is well known today, are guided by the ionosphere as the second plate of a condenser. They go around the world easily. When the signals arrived at the antipode from all different directions however, the paths were enough different so that the signals were a bedlam of confusion. It soon became apparent that we should have another station to handle the hemisphere opposite from this station.
So another antenna — similar in design — was constructed at Northwest Cape, Australia with Navy cooperation, and direct activity of Australia. The two stations had the call letters NAA, which were the call letters of the key station of the Navy network, and NWC for Northwest Cape. Between them they have more than adequate coverage of each hemisphere. And I'll resist the temptation to tell you the stories about those developments.
The Pentagon in the days of spending for progress had established the Guided Missile Committee as an overseer of the many missile projects, which were proliferating in various areas. At that time the committee was headed by Pat Hyland who died recently, who was the genius behind the Hughes build-up of electronics activities. He was then the head of the Bendix Research Laboratories; it was before the principal activities in Hughes. The Guided Missile Committee had subcommittees one related to propulsion, and one was related to guidance and control. Those were two entirely separate problems. Because of our current work for the Bell Laboratories on their guided missiles, I was appointed chairman of the Subcommittee on Guidance and Control.
Were you also on the full committee?
Yes. I was a member of the full committee; I was chairman of that subcommittee. And I must say that I was not terribly well prepared for that responsibility because of my nose close to the grindstone in technical progress as distinguished from the overall development picture. But I was supported on the panel by representatives of Army, Navy and Air Force who were young officers or civilians who were extremely competent and who did much to fill in for my deficiency in the outside world. So our subcommittee was rather well regarded. We were active, visiting the development sites of all the guided missiles under our jurisdiction.
What were you expected to do?
We were expected to give an overview to the main committee of the state of progress and problems in guidance and control, giving some recommendation as to our views of the projects that were deserving of primary attention. It is interesting to mention that one of our babies was the Sidewinder missile, which was under development at China Lake against the advice of the Navy management. That was a bootleg development, which later became one of the stars in their arsenal. So we got the early progress reports on that missile. It had elements of innovation that were extremely ingenious and impressed us very much.
That work at China Lake continued from '50 until '53.
Yes. That was the work of innovation proceeding under forced draft. Incidentally, Bell Laboratories were naturally one of the principal contractors in that field.
Then in the early 'sixties you served on the Defense Science Board?
Yes. That was a board of a rather nebulous responsibility, exploring some problem areas under the guidance of the Pentagon. I was appointed because I'd been active in the Guided Missile Committee. I think I did not contribute a great deal in my service on that board. My activities and knowledge never exceeded the critical mass in the overall picture. It was very interesting, and it was a real compliment that I was appointed.
You said that in '59 Hazeltine Corporation acquired Wheeler Laboratories, but that for the next decade or so Wheeler Labs continued fairly independently. Were there big changes in your activities in that decade?
The principal activity of the Laboratories still was continuing projects like we were working on for Bell Laboratories and others like that. I remained active in those projects. We made numerous innovations, which went into the preliminary designs for ABM radar and missiles. Those were unfortunately handicapped by topside policies from the Pentagon and the Executive Branch. It was their disgrace and affliction when we abandoned our activities on ABM. Disgrace because there is no substitute for it; an affliction because Russia was not abandoning their activities. At any rate some of our designs went in: the phased-array radars that were carried forward.
Also in '59 you became a director of Hazeltine.
Yes. MacDonald had had ambitions of my carrying on after him. He was not very good at evaluating people and their motivations. And he was disappointed at that time that I was not motivated to head the management of the company. He had a deficiency of evaluating men by imagining that they were able to do what he wanted them to do. In that respect I was a disappointment. And it was shortly after then in 1961 that he died, I think by suicide because he was overburdened by the stress of the company management. His deficiencies in personnel evaluation became apparent in his successor team.
How did things change after MacDonald's death?
The research laboratory, which was an outstanding group of innovation, continued during the period and after to grow and make contributions in developmental contracts for the government. It was not adequately guided or supported, but enough so that it was a healthy section of the company and became quite famous. Outside of that, the company's work was mainly design and manufacturing. The talented group in that field were not terribly handicapped by the deficiencies in top management. The company continued as the principal contractor for IFF, radar and in some other areas. That was disrupted mainly by things like the Zenith crisis and the problem of profitability in the company. The company never achieved a real stature of profitability. It would be temporary and then die a natural death.
At the zenith crisis in '65 you became chief executive officer.
Yes, then I continued as chairman of the board. Understandably, I was highly regarded in the company, and so I could be helpful.
How active was the board in direction of the company?
About like any board. It is difficult to define the function of a board in a company riding on technology because the board is not technologically competent. Our board supported MacDonald and his successor team. They did some things right. They welcomed my leadership as far as I could provide it as chairman of the board. The board of directors is not typically an inspired leadership, but they were good citizens.
You remained active as chairman of the board of directors until '77?
Yes. Chief scientist at Hazeltine until '87. That became essentially a recognition of my seniority and of what I could contribute in some areas. I did not contribute over the board to all of the different projects, which had developed faster than I had.
But when you reached 65 or 67, you certainly didn't retire. Did you cut back much in your work?
The then head of the company, Westermann, was a lawyer. So he finally followed the "rule of age 65" and to no hardship to me removed me from executive management. I had been president of Wheeler Laboratories, but he gave me other opportunities that were suited for my talents. So I retired a couple of times after that. But somehow, someone decided that management still wanted me handy. I had some real opportunities in that area. Incidentally, one of the principal factors was that when our laboratory had shrunk somewhat in the decade of the 'sixties and then was merged in the research laboratories of the company in 1970, quite a number of our top men continued at Hazeltine. One of them is still one of the top executives in the company, and several of them are active in various areas.
Can you characterize the decade of the late 'sixties and early 'seventies also?
It was a period of disaster for innovative engineering in the military. More nit picking and contracting, and so-called competitive bidding.
Did that work to the disadvantage of Hazeltine?
Yes. It was a constant obstacle that you had to find ways to circumvent. Recently, for example, a major Air Force project was given to the low bidder after we had clearly prevailed in the technical evaluation. The project was still sorely needed, but the penny-pinchers obstructed it.
What type of work did you do in the seventies?
I worked as a support to engineers who were confronted with the type of problem that I could help with. They were extremely appreciative. They communicated very well with me. It's hard to point to anything of great significance in that period.
Were you working full time?
I worked full time until the early eighties, and then I cut down to three days a week. In the 'seventies I was full time. The Wheeler Laboratories had a field laboratory in Smithtown, Long Island, and as our work decreased, our activities concentrated in that laboratory. So in 1970 I moved to Smithtown. I had been living in Great Neck, which was close to the headquarters. And I had an office in the Smithtown laboratory. I moved out there in the 'sixties when our work was shrinking and concentrated in Smithtown. And in the 'seventies our laboratory was continued at a reduced level at Smithtown, which became mainly testing facilities for our antennas. The laboratory was merged into the research laboratories in Greenlawn. That was not too far from Smithtown. So it was still convenient for me to commute there. And I continued full time for a while and then part time until I retired in '87.
Would you please give the history of and describe your last invention?
Immediately after the war Hazeltine demonstrated at the Air Force activities in Indianapolis an altitude-coded beacon, which was an offshoot of IFF. That demonstration set the stage for the altitude-coded beacons that are universally used today and with no credit to Hazeltine. The fact that they made the first demonstration was ignored in later developments. So the surveillance radars in airports gradually were adapted to altitude-coded beacons. That could be either a response to the radar or a response to an interrogation signal transmitted in conjunction with the radar. Around 1980, it was recognized that a surveillance radar should have a separate antenna for transmission of the interrogation signal. We were active in that field, so we tackled the problem of making this radar that was to be attached to existing radar without overloading the mechanical stresses. The new radar was to be a flat bedspring mounted on top of the rotating radar for surveillance. The first thing they ran into was wind loading. They were very apprehensive about the wind loading of an extra screen tacked on top of the radar farthest from the bearings.
We tackled that problem. The first approach was a conventional array radar. The main radar was not an array. A conventional flat array of many elements was suitable for that purpose. It was not a phased array. It was a mechanically rotating array. So we designed a first-cut at solving that problem, and they said that the rods in the array were too much wind loading. The rods were used as a reflector, and there were more reflecting rods than there were excited rods for radiating the signal to the reflector. With the support of my group, I invented a way of reducing the number of reflecting rods to one half. And the Air Force was quite excited about that improvement. So we — with the techniques that were peculiar to our laboratory — we designed these rods to have a large reflection without a large diameter. I devised a way to tune the rods so that they looked bigger than they were. The Air Force was very much pleased and excited about it. So we made models to prove the design. Then they put it out for competition. We applied for a patent on the improvement, and I must say I think it was a prime candidate for a patent; it was a definite improvement.
Then they put out for bids. We did have a realistic price to manufacture a number of flat antennas according to our design. Our design by that time was open information in the FAA, and Texas Instruments, a giant, bid on the manufacture. I suspect they bid at a loss to get the contract. And the nit-picking contracting mechanism of the FAA, which is notorious; and it gave the contract to Texas Instruments. Then my patent issued, and we planned to have the patent tested in the courts. It was tested in a court in Washington, DC, which was not one of the usual federal court structures.
You were charging Texas Instruments with infringement?
Yes. I'm not sure whether the suit was against the company or the Air Force but the case was tried. I testified as the inventor. The court completely ignored the level of innovation that was involved and decided that it wasn't an invention. The contest was not carried further. The case was complicated by the fact that there was a question of whether we had made that invention under contract to the FAA., In which case they would get a free license. I think we had a valid case that it was not. At any rate the patent was not adjudicated.
It's interesting that that was filed as early as 1973, which is quite a while before it went into common use. It was issued in '74. The examiner, incidentally, was sympathetic. It was only the court that threw sand in the bearings. So this reflector was used in the altitude-coded beacon that is universal in commercial aircraft today. It had to be installed on the top of the existing surveillance radar. So when you look around a large airport today, you'll see rotating radar and on top is a little bedspring, which is this antenna.
Is it essentially your design that's still being used?
Yes. The design was applying my invention by my engineers. So I get a great satisfaction out of looking around and seeing it in use even though our company was denied the profits from it.
I want to ask you now about patent law — in particular two very important cases that you and Hazeltine were involved with: Detrola v. Hazeltine and Zenith v. Hazeltine.
To introduce the subject, in the 'thirties I was awarded a large number of patents, and our company was very much aware of patents, because our income was royalty from patents which included engineering services to the licensee manufacturing companies. The company thrived in the 1930's because we had a package license to manufacturers, mostly small manufacturers, who were manufacturing home radio receivers. In order to compete with the large companies, they utilized our engineering services and benefited very much from them. They were a part of the package license deal.
Was it the usual case that a licensee would also call on your engineering services?
That was the pattern, and all of them did. So whatever happened during the 'thirties enabled us to thrive and expand during the Depression, which was very fortunate. At the same time, the patent licensing situation was becoming confused.
Here I should introduce the subject by pointing out that the patent statute provides an offer and acceptance by the government and the inventor. In return for the inventor disclosing his invention, the government promised the inventor a monopoly for the period of 17 years. I shall not dwell on the rationale of that period or the rights and wrongs of that kind of a statute. That is what existed. Then at the turn of the century, the government became obsessed with the subject of monopolies, and I suppose some monopolies were an abuse of the power of large companies. Gradually the courts confused the situation by reading this as an opposition to the monopoly granted by the patent statute. Now let me emphasize that the statute provided an offer and an acceptance. The acceptance implied the grant of a monopoly. In the 'twenties and 'thirties the courts began to dilute the consideration offered by the government by objecting to the monopoly accorded by the patent statute. However, the government continued to make the offer to the inventor. The inventors continued to accept the offer. And the consideration promised by the government was gradually diluted. This situation had not reached a disaster level in the 1930's, but it was approaching that. Our company survived in the 'thirties on royalties on a package deal which was entirely lawful by the terms of the patent statute.
Now do you think that the changed climate, the unwillingness on the part of the government to enforce patent rights, was perceived by companies that therefore decided not to pay for the use of patents?
It is not quite as clear as that. What happened, however, is that the company using a patent owned by somebody else became bolder in infringing. And that got a lot of support from some of the courts in violating the patent statute. It is very sad that the government made an offer that the inventor accepted and then reneged on its part of the deal.
Now so we go back to the 'thirties. Our company profited by the patent situation in the 'thirties, and that was our entire income. During that period the Supreme Court was increasingly antagonistic toward patents, and out of about 15 patents that reached the Supreme Court during that period, the Court invalidated all but one. Now here we have to realize that only the important patents ever reach the Supreme Court because it is an expensive process.
Were the usual grounds for denying the claims of the patent-holder that no invention was involved?
That was a common basis for the decisions. Whether there were other technicalities, I don't recall.
It seems that that might be something that the patent examiner would decide at the time the patent is granted.
That is the philosophy that is stated in the patent statute.
But a patent examiner can decide that this is an invention, and then years later in court the judge can decide that no invention was made.
Well, the statute did not anticipate the abuse of the patent situation such as happened over the years. Now I'm not commenting on whether the enforcement of patents was subject to abuse because that is a loaded question that's hard to answer in some cases.
Here I should mention, in all of my many patents, there was one that was outstanding in its importance. That was one of my earlier patents issued in 1932 on a subject we called diode automatic volume control for radio receivers, or AVC. This invention came into universal use in the 1930's and shows no signs of obsolescence. It seems to be what I call a timeless invention, which has been adapted to changes in technology — for example, from vacuum tubes to transistors. And is still used in every AM radio receiver. AM means amplitude modulation, and it was amplitude modulation that used a diode detector.
Now in the 1930's the industry appreciated the value of this particular invention, and almost all the manufacturers took a license with Hazeltine Corporation for the use of that and the rest of the patents in their portfolio. One exception was RCA — the giant in the field. So they contested our patent when we filed suit for infringement. In 1938 that case was tried in Wilmington, Delaware in the Second Circuit. It is interesting that the case was so overwhelmingly in our favor that RCA accepted a license without waiting for a decision by the court.
When RCA did that, it wasn't possible for Hazeltine to get a court decision — is that right?
It did deprive Hazeltine of a much needed court decision following that trial.
Could Hazeltine have declined to grant them the license in order to get the court decision?
I doubt it. I think the court would have rejected that position. The court was not anxious to make decisions, and it probably was very much relieved when it was relieved of that burden. In any case, that was a climax of almost all the manufacturing companies paying royalties to Hazeltine with just one or two exceptions. In order to maintain our patent position, it appeared necessary to prosecute these exceptions, and one was the Detrola Radio Corporation in Detroit. This was not a major manufacturing company. We sued Detrola, the case came to trial in 1939 or 1940, and the District Court in Detroit awarded us a decision in favor of our patent on validity and infringement. Their attorney was a very ambitious trustbuster, and like many attorneys did not have much regard for the truth in his briefs. However, the lower court surmounted his diatribe.
Then he appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals doesn't hear testimony. It takes the record of the lower court and invites argument. In the argument of that case it was very clear from the Court's questions that they had no sympathy with the claim by Detrola. The decision by that court was unanimous — that means three justices — in favor of the validity and infringement of our patent.
Then the attorney appealed to the Supreme Court. Now it's the usual practice that the Supreme Court takes cases to resolve conflicting opinions in the lower courts. Here there was no conflicting opinion on this patent. There was a slightly related opinion by the Second Court of Appeals in an earlier case, which was confused by a poorly planned presentation. So that was followed by a reissue of the patent in order to meet the objections of that court. So the patent as it appeared to the Court of Appeals had no adverse decision as a conflict.
The defendant, Detrola, when it was a defendant, argued in the Supreme Court that they should accept this case because there was a conflict. I think in an ordinary situation the Supreme Court would have rejected that argument, but they were already on the record as opposing patents. So they gave the benefit of the doubt to the infringer. So we had to argue that case in the Supreme Court, and there was an unfortunate circumstance in the argument. The chief attorney of our firm had been involved in negotiating labor disputes, and the night before the argument he came to Washington in a state of exhaustion. I mention that because he was definitely not at his best in arguing the case before the Supreme Court. Whether that had any influence I doubt because it seemed in that session that the Court had already made up its mind. So one justice wrote the opinion. And when I say "wrote the opinion," I have a picture that he gave some notes to his law assistant and told him to write up an adverse decision. I cannot prove that.
Who wrote the decision?
The name of the justice escapes me at this moment. He was a senior justice on the court. But the decision included mistakes of fact, which should have been clear. They were clearly covered in our brief so there was no excuse. But the opposing counsel didn't mind stretching the factual situation, and the Supreme Court embraced his arguments. They should have been ashamed. So in 1941 the Supreme Court invalidated the key patent of our entire portfolio.
What did that mean for Hazeltine's revenues? You certainly didn't then collect from Detrola, but did it have any immediate effect on the other licensees?
No, for several contributory reasons. One, most of our licensees — by then including RCA — were supporters of the company as an outstanding engineering organization and they were benefiting by the company's work. Secondly, a large factor was the fact that our licensing included not only patents but engineering. So there was no immediate reaction. It is notable that the Supreme Court did not say we had to return all the royalties we'd collected.
Is that sometimes the case in such decisions?
I think it may go either way. But to a layman it seems axiomatic that if the patent isn't valid — the licensor should return the royalties. Well, the situation was more complicated than that, and it was very fortunate they didn't require that. Now the effect in Hazeltine was that the key patent in our portfolio had run nine years out of the promised 17-year monopoly. So the least effect would have been to destroy that monopoly for the remaining eight years.
The war was becoming more and more intense in Europe, and that greatly detracted from the manufacturing operations in our country because the government was beginning to crack down on materials. If it hadn't been for that situation, I am afraid the cumulative result in a year or two would have been the destruction of our patent situation. We can't prove what would have happened, but it was fortunate for the company that the wartime activities of the government placed a great demand on the engineering skills, which were the foundation of our organization. So during the year or two before Pearl Harbor, the preliminary efforts of the government toward war activities yielded for us a few contracts that were of varying importance — only one that was really important — and introduced us to the practice that was a new experience with us; that is, contracting with the government and especially in a nebulous activity like development.
Could we try to separate the factors there? I know, of course, that World War II and the approaching entry of the U.S. into that war changed the situation for Hazeltine. But after that decision, was there discussion within Hazeltine that maybe the approach of the company should change?
Yes. That was a natural result of that experience because this decision was not an isolated case. But the question became moot for a few years. Now here I might say in view of the fact our company survived the next few years and I had good employment, the reduction in the value of the company caused by that decision was not immediately obvious because of the war situation. I was too tolerant of that decision in my thinking at the time. And as I shall be mentioning in connection with other incidents, it's only with the passage of time that I've thought through and considered the seriousness of some of these mistakes in the Court.
But there was no recourse then. Is that right?
That is correct.
You just had to accept that decision.
Now someone on the outside would have said, "Well, go ahead and collect royalties on your other patents." It was a tremendous effort and a tremendous expense to litigate any one patent. And the others of lesser importance were quite numerous — maybe a dozen. So it was not a simple case if we had been required to rearrange our pattern of operation to litigate every patent. This decision, incidentally, did not refer to patent licensing. The briefs by the plaintiff did, and I have no doubt that that was a major influence on the decision. There was no merit in the technical position of the decision. That is my biased view, and I think it's correct. So then after the war the activities of Hazeltine had changed very much, and they could see the writing on the wall in the denial of the government to enforce patent rights. So they relied less and less on patent royalties. There are some interesting sidelines there, but I'll bypass them at the moment.
Maybe we should move then to the other Supreme Court decision that affected you.
Yes. In the years after the war Hazeltine developed a powerful patent situation in the field of television and in the natural course sued some companies for infringement of a few of the earlier television patents.
Were most manufacturers paying licensing fees to Hazeltine?
The pattern was not clear after the war. Some did, and they all benefited from the work that we did that was made public. So there was a need for obtaining decisions of infringement if we were to continue our patent income at any substantial level. So on one television patent, which was not in itself terribly important, we sued Zenith for infringement. Zenith was one of the largest companies who did not then have a Hazeltine license. They did at one time.
The Zenith case escalated beyond anything we could imagine. The attorney, who was a very aggressive, unprincipled advocate, escalated the case into an anti-trust counterclaim. Knowing the views of the courts on trust matters, that was a very smart thing to do. But it occurred in an environment that was disastrous. You have here a picture of an extremely aggressive and unprincipled advocate appearing before a judge who was incompetent and had no strength of his own. It became apparent that this District Judge in Chicago was totally dominated by the personality of this attorney. Everything the attorney said, the judge accepted. Everything he wanted, the judge did. Now what does that mean? First, when the attorney escalated the case to an anti-trust claim, the natural thing was for the court to give us time to prepare for what is legally known as a "surprise." Litigation is supposed to be immune from surprises.
But I'm also surprised myself that that can be part of the original case. It seems to me that first the matter of whether Zenith infringed on the patent should be settled, and then the claims against Hazeltine's practices should be a second case.
I have all sympathy with your reaction. But it is frequent practice to file a counterclaim in any dispute. And too often the counterclaim is intended to confuse the issue, as it was in this case. So our attorney, who was not experienced in anti-trust, petitioned for time to prepare a defense to the counterclaim. On the admonition of the other attorney, the court refused this petition and went to trial on a claim on which we had had no time to prepare.
Can the denial of that petition be appealed?
It should have been — right then and there. Our attorneys were not astute in that area. And they made the mistake of proceeding with the trial without resolving that conflict. I might say between us we couldn't imagine any court being so subservient to a lawyer's pressure as was this court. So the case went to briefs, and one day in 1965 a decision was rendered which accepted in its entirety Zenith's counterclaim.
One thing at which this lawyer convinced the court — he just told the court, and the court accepted — was the principle that our gross receipts were our income. And therefore we were a giant picking on poor little Zenith. There was no factual, no logical basis for it. So the decision by the court did what Zenith requested: awarded Zenith damages of $16 million. Now I'll tell you a little bit more about the details when we get to the subsequent proceedings. So in the paper the next day the headline: "ZENITH AWARDED $48 MILLION" because damages were tripled in that area.
Is that automatic?
Yes, but the judge didn't know that. He was shocked when he saw that headline. He didn't even know that the damages had to be tripled. But that was $48 million, and the company's net worth was $20 million. In other words, he casually handed the company to Zenith. And he didn't even know he was doing that. In fact he wasn't a bit concerned.
What that did to the company's stock and our business in the next few months you can imagine. It was very fortunate that one bank did not withdraw our line of credit on the basis of that decision. They took a chance that it would be corrected. And that was one factor that saved the company from total disaster. Now here, in order to appreciate his decision and the aftermath, we have to look into the nature of Zenith's claims. Zenith's two top officials testified falsely that if it hadn't been for Hazeltine's licensing practice, they would have made millions of dollars of profit in exporting to Canada, England and Australia.
But they didn't seem to be restrained within this country?
No. The counterclaim was not based on those receipts.
But they were saying that they refrained from marketing in those countries because of Hazeltine's patents.
Big Zenith was intimidated by Hazeltine.
But it's strange that they weren't intimidated in this country yet claimed that they didn't dare export.
Well, that question did not come up. The counterclaim however was totally absurd. After the decision naturally we had hearings, and we obtained the assistance of a prominent anti-trust attorney who was much more skilled than ours. In the period of hearings after the decision, several things were brought out. We had time to prepare, and it turned out that in England, Zenith could not have imported sets from the United States during that period. There were statutory bars.
England wasn't permitting the importation of that kind of device?
Yes. So the Zenith claim to damages in England was totally false. Then it turned out that in Australia they couldn't have imported any receivers for technical reasons. So their claim in Australia was totally false. In Canada their claim was based on the licensing practices there. The licensing practice in Canada was a patent pool. That is a very sensible approach when one industry is confronted with many patents. So in Canada the legal way to collect royalties was to join the pool and take a proportion of the pool's returns, which was evaluated in accordance with the patents you had in the pool. Now that kind of a pool, which incidentally is entirely consistent with the patent statute, had been outlawed in the United States under monopoly provisions. So Zenith said because the pool was illegal in the United States, Hazeltine was violating United States law by licensing according to the law in Canada. This was absurd on a logical basis, but that was brought out in the hearings after the decision. In the final arguments after the decision, the judge casually remarked that the testimony by Zenith's officials was unbelievable anyway — on the basis of which he had awarded Zenith tremendous damages. He relieved us of any obligations in England and Australia. But he still left intact the counterclaim in Canada.
Did he reduce the amount of damages?
Proportionately to about one third. Here I cannot overemphasize that there was absolutely no violation of U.S. law by United States companies licensing in the pool in Canada. And, as a matter of fact, we knew that the Department of Commerce was encouraging that. That of course didn't come out as an argument in the case. We just knew it. So the claim was not withdrawn; the claim with regard to Canada was left on the books. The District Judge had no concept of what was lawful and not lawful, and that had no influence on his decision. Then that reduced the damages to, I think, $16 million after tripling. That was even a little less than our net worth. So we appealed the decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which convened in Chicago. In the arguments before that court, it was quite apparent that the justices were incensed at the irresponsibility of the lower court. They totally rejected the decision and returned it to the lower court for revision. Now I'm not familiar with all the technicalities of that procedure. It's a little surprising that they didn't just reverse the decision. But at any rate, they were on our side, and they did the unusual procedure of convening the entire panel of, I think, nine justices in the Second Circuit to a final hearing on this appeal. They unanimously returned it to the lower court. Well, that didn't phase our opposing counsel. He said all we have to do is to bypass the Court of Appeals. So he connived to make an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Before it went back to the original court?
Before it went back to the Court of Appeals. And as a matter of common sense you would imagine that the Supreme Court would send him home empty-handed. Instead, they accepted the case. Now you might wonder how that could happen. One justice on the Supreme Court was Byron White, who is still sitting. He had been aggressively anti-trust in his views and was very anxious to make some new law that would settle all the questions on anti-trust relating to patents. So I can picture the Supreme Court in a discussion as to whether they would accept the case and who would write the decision. And Byron White enthusiastically raises his hand and said he would write the decision, because it was an opportunity to air his prejudices. Now I would think the court would have been sensitive to that situation. All I can say is they weren't. They accepted the appeal, and he wrote the opinion, and here we run into technicalities that I won't pretend to comment on. The net result was that he wrote some new law and applied it retroactively.
Did he express it as making new law instead of interpreting?
Yes he wanted credit for it, and in his own view he deserved credit for taking this initiative. I think in an objective view you would still arrive at the conclusion that he wrote new law and applied it retroactively. If there's anything unsound in legal practice, it's applying new law retroactively. So you would imagine that some of the other justices wouldn't go along. Well, they were against patents in general terms. They went along, and no one took the trouble to challenge Justice White's opinion. Now I think I didn't emphasize in the previous case the same thing happened that no justice challenged the opinion written by one justice.
They were both unanimous decisions?
Yes. And unanimous reversals of the unanimous position of the Court of Appeals without a conflict. Just completely different from what we conceived as the function of the Supreme Court.
I would it's fairly rare, that a unanimous decision of the Appeals Court can be reversed unanimously by the Supreme Court.
Especially if there's no conflict. The typical case is a conflict between Appeals Courts. I've done two generations of thinking since my first experience and one generation since the second experience. And I've crystallized my views a great deal beyond what they were immediately after the occurrences. And so I would like to know how many decisions there are which are unanimous. And how many of those decisions reversed the Court of Appeals. I suspect the number is near zero, so I was the victim of what I expect to learn more was a very exceptional situation even more irresponsible — than some other Supreme Court decisions.
What effect did this Supreme Court decision have on Hazeltine Corporation?
In the intervening period our management, headed by an attorney Westermann, had done a good deal of planning as to how we might escape from this disaster. After the Supreme Court decision they were able to negotiate with Zenith officers, not the attorney. The attorney, I imagine, had gone off with his million-dollar fee and was very happy about the whole thing. But in the negotiation a final settlement was arrived at which preserved the company at approximately half the value it had had before. But it did prevent Zenith just taking over the company.
What damages were actually paid by Hazeltine?
That's complicated because it involved a confusing set of accounting, and Zenith accepted some royalty responsibility. So it is impossible for me to state in a few words the basis for the final settlement. The company had naturally shrunk during that period of adversity. And it was six years from the original decision in 1965 until the final opinion in '71 that we were in limbo.
It had naturally diluted the efforts of our management very much. It is remarkable that we were able to continue a fair level of activity during that period. It's hard to understand how it could happen, but it involved the goodwill of many parties outside the company.
What was your role at Hazeltine during those years?
At the time of the first decision the company was in shock. MacDonald had died three years before, and his successor team was not too strong. The company was saved by the emergence of their principal corporation counsel, Westermann, as a competent leader during this period. The first question was how could the company continue against this adversity? Some of the directors resigned because they were fearful of financial responsibility. The employees were naturally demoralized.
What part of Hazeltine revenues in this time were licensing agreements?
I'm uncertain because there was a period where royalties on color television patents were a major income to the company, and I've forgotten just what years those were.
Now in conferences within management someone — probably Westermann — brought up the possibility that the employees would have complete confidence if I were in the driver's seat during that period. That had some validity because I was well known; I had been employed the longest. So Westermann called me into the management deliberations, and on the advice of the company attorney I was made chairman of the board. There was not a chairman before that, because they did not wish to upset the existing management titles; they were trying not to upset anything in that situation. So the executive committee became the de facto management team in the company. I was chairman, but I guided the management more than assuming the primary responsibility because I wasn't familiar with the business at the management level.
What I did do was to inaugurate some practices that the previous management had delayed or rejected. The first was installing air-conditioning. By 1965 air-conditioning was presumptive in major operations, and MacDonald had had a blind spot there. The successor management had been timid. So [that was] the first thing I did that was bold. And it was wise in one respect because it lifted the morale of the employees very much. The ones who stayed for years always remembered that day. Secondly, the company had no retirement plan and we in discussion in the executive committee perceived that a retirement plan would greatly increase the morale. So we decided that we should consider some retirement plan. Well, I was in the driver's seat, and we called in the best advice that we could corral for ideas as to the kind of a retirement plan. And one by one I reviewed them and rejected them. They were what you might have called "business as usual," and I didn't like them.
What were the main objections to the retirement plans? They didn't amount to very much?
Well, the main objection was that they relied on the unsound practice of promising a lot that the company maybe couldn't afford. That was the so-called "defined benefits structure." And I could see that it was unsound, so I put together a plan which was essentially a savings plan with the company sponsorship and the company protecting the accumulated savings — pending the time that they became payable. My plan, which did not exist in any large company at the time, has come to be called the "defined contribution plan." The distraction is that mine is essentially a forced savings plan that does not place a burden on the company. They contribute to it at the time the employee's benefits accumulate, but not beyond that. And so it's a pay-as-you-go plan. Our employees were not fussy about what kind of a plan they had. Some critics said, "Oh, that plan is no good." But we installed that plan, and it also contributed much to boosting the morale.
Years later something happened which is called ERISA. This was passed statute that regulated the responsibility of employers and pension plans. The "defined benefit plans" almost universally had to be redefined to meet the requirements of this statute because otherwise the companies were assuming obligations that they might not be able to meet. Our plan didn't have to change a single word. So a decade or two before ERISA, I complied with its requirements.
This was in the period '66 when you were chief executive officer?
Yes. And it is not all that great, but when you boil it down, there are very few pension plans that are all that great. But it was a responsible retirement plan. And it has survived over a period of time. So those were my two principal contributions while I was heading the company. And I think it's fair to say I contributed very much to maintaining the morale until the case was finally settled five, six years later. I did not particularly enjoy management. I tried to give good advice to the other officials who were conducting the day-by-day management. I think my advice or giving them a free rein was fairly thoughtful and fairly effective.
So after a year as chief executive officer, at the end of '66, I turned the management over to Westermann as the new president. By that time the situation had settled down enough so that our advisors felt we were free to reorganize the executive team. During that period I continued some activity in Wheeler Laboratories — as I still had an office there — I also had an office, of course, in the corporation headquarters. The headquarters were then in Little Neck, and Wheeler Laboratories was in nearby Great Neck. They were both near my home. In that respect I was very fortunate. It's only with years that I've become totally convinced of the irresponsible action of the courts in the Zenith case. It was less extreme in the earlier case because the earlier case involved a small company. And on the face of it only involved one of many patents, albeit the key patent of the portfolio. But in the case of Zenith the Supreme Court decision on its face handed the company to Zenith, and it destroyed the value of the stock. And destroyed the employment of the employees. And to those factors the Supreme Court seemed to be totally oblivious.
What was the reduction in employees at Hazeltine as a result of the decision?
At the bottom during that period of stress, about half what it was at the beginning? At the beginning it was inching toward 3,000; at the bottom it was around 1500.
And the stock value also fell?
It fluctuated a great deal. On the face of it the stock should have been worth nothing, but I don't think there was a universal reaction to accept the irresponsible decisions that were involved. You just couldn't imagine the government acting so arbitrarily.
I would like to comment on the other eight justices. I mention in passing that by the time the case started in the Supreme Court, Warren was Chief Justice. And by the time it ended, Burger was Chief Justice, and he abstained in the final decision. We have here, I think, a clear case where the justices who did not write the opinion were totally negligent in their obligation to understand the case. Now how can I rationalize that very radical view? The cases we read about in the paper, I don't remember a single one being unanimous. Sometimes only a couple of justices will make a faint objection, but never unanimous. So I don't really know whether there were any substantial number of decisions that were unanimous. Then suppose we found two or three. Then I would inquire, were they reversal of a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals? More likely they were resolving conflict. But I would like to know the facts, and I would like to have someone work with me who had the resources to research the facts.
I wanted to ask you more general questions about how in your career patent law has worked in practice. The theory is certainly to encourage invention, encourage technological innovation, development, by rewarding the people who do that. How well has it served that objective in your experience?
Well, if you say that the monopoly is outlawed, then the answer is that it hasn't in any degree served the intention of the statute. It wasn't as simple as that. It was almost that simple by the end of the 'thirties. If a company contested a patent monopoly on the grounds of anti-trust, it was presumptive that company would prevail. It's my impression, that in the recent few examples of major inventions which were patented and the users paid royalties, I'm not clear as to all the circumstances. Some questions arise: Was it easier for the users to pay royalties than to challenge a patent in the courts? Was it less expensive? Because patent litigation was extremely expensive. So the overall question does not have a simple answer. All I know is that in our case the intent of the patent statute was ignored in both cases.
Something you said about Hazeltine Corporation at the end of the 'thirties and in the 'forties suggests that if patent law had been rigorously enforced, Hazeltine and presumably other companies might have more vigorously pursued patents, published, applied for patents, assured that they'd be getting some revenues from that.
For reasons you might query, people are still aggressive in obtaining patents. More often than not, it's for personal aggrandization. I wouldn't ignore that motive in our cases, but we at least had a wider view and a wider experience.
It seems that, in both of these cases you've described, Hazeltine might have fared better with very good legal counsel. Were these some shortcomings in the legal counsel.
Yes. The slight chinks in the armor in the first case were the result of very inept actions by our attorneys. They were unrealistic and inexperienced. The first case conceivably would have come out in our favor if it hadn't been for those chinks in our armor. In the second case, it was clear that our attorneys were totally incompetent after the anti-trust claim.
So they were patent law attorneys and not specialists in anti-trust?
Yes. And they were incompetent in the sense that they didn't know enough to halt the case until they had time to prepare. So you can easily rationalize that no attorney's perfect, and each attorney has his areas where he's more competent. That doesn't help the defendant much if the case goes against him.
Incidentally, the attorney managing the second case was extremely competent as the head of our patent department in the years before the war.
But it may be one lesson that people at Hazeltine drew was that one should spend more money on legal counsel and get specialists for anti-trust law.
In the period before the war we spent plenty of money. We were hiring the most expensive attorneys, but the firm delegated our patent prosecution to a junior member of the firm who was a bright chap with engineering education, but he did not recognize the realities of the situation. And both the patent applications and the prosecution of the cases relied too much on, shall I say, lay talent? They listened to me a great deal. I had my ideas as to what could be adequate, and my ideas were not based on any legal competence.
Typically, on approaching any new area, I was immediately interested in what had been done, what had been accomplished, and what was the state of the art. I mean that in the popular sense, not only in the legal sense. In working with my engineers, where much of my time was spent on one-to-one education, I've always emphasized the historical background. They were fascinated, and it gave the work much more reality and much more interest in their view.
So you would look in the literature for earlier work in that area?
I was not terribly well informed by reading. I have read much less than I should have, but from incidental reading here and there and from incidental reports on what was happening, I usually had some incidents to tell them that were interesting about the problems at hand.
So throughout your career you've had this interest in the history of the engineering?
Yes. And it was natural because it was paralleled in my experience, the experience of engineers going through the same formative stages.
I suppose there's a great difference between someone doing electronic engineering as you have done from the 1920's, say, to the present and someone who is in a mature area of engineering, say, mechanical engineering or certain areas of chemical engineering.
It's a little hard to put in a few words a reaction to that point. I have said that I was born at a very fortunate time in history when major inventions were in their infancy and where I could follow their development over my lifetime. And in radio and electronics that was true until the recent years where the rate of development exploded. Now otherwise it's a little hard to generalize because you really have to take it case by case. So let's imagine a couple of cases.
Armstrong was a radio amateur, one of the early members of the Radio Club of America. Here I might mention that in 1909 it was the first society carrying the word "radio." The Institute of Radio Engineers was three years later. So he was interested in putting things together and making them work. And just how he learned most of what he knew, it's hard to describe. It wasn't just taught in the schools, and he was not a highly educated individual. So there was just some knowledge that spread by osmosis among the people that were interested, with very little formal publication.
It's hard to describe. I learned about radio from radio catalogs, which told you what to buy and how to put it together. And it wasn't until I was working at the Bureau of Standards that I had any exposure to the real technology. So these are questions that are hard to define and hard to answer. To take a related case, you might ask how Chester Carlson learned about the principles of Xerox because they were largely rejected by the science fraternity. And I think that was an extreme case where the inventor had to evolve his own views and his own principles.
It was in 1978 that you published Hazeltine, the Professor and four years later The Early Days of Wheeler and Hazeltine Corporation. What is it you hoped to achieve in writing those books?
In the first one I felt a real obligation to put on the record a view of Hazeltine that was not on the record. He was famous, yes. But there were very few things that you could trace to his invention or innovation. His principal innovation you would say was in his teaching in later years. I wanted to put on the record the things that I regarded as the reasons for his becoming famous and achieving what he did.
Now you wrote that principally for engineers to read?
I guess so. But I was equally interested in bringing his accomplishments to the attention of his family and friends. You see, he died in 1964, long before that. And he didn't write very much. So there wasn't much in the literature relating to his accomplishments and particularly to his intellectual genius. And that I tried to bring out. I hope I was successful. I know his family liked it.
I think it's a very eloquent book. The book on the early days of Wheeler and Hazeltine Corporation, what were your main objectives there?
Autobiography. Why does one write an autobiography? And as you can imagine there are conflicting motivations. I won't pretend to say why. A lot of people do, and some people are totally oblivious to that opportunity.
What value would you say history of electrical engineering has today for engineers today or for others?
I think no man is educated unless he knows history. And so you might say, one, the history of civilization in which we are seldom well educated, and history as a profession, and the history of his particular specialty. I think the people who are outstanding in their accomplishments recognize that the history of their development is relevant, and it should be put on the record.
What historical books have you particularly enjoyed or found valuable?
I'm hesitating because there were rather few, distributed over a period of time. And I'm embarrassed because I should have read much more so that much of my knowledge of history and evolution has been by osmosis rather than reading a book.
Of course there isn't very much literature in the history of electrical engineering to begin with.
Well, don't say that because there were outstanding volumes published in rather early days. And I don't mean mainly autobiographical. They're autobiographical because one author wrote them. And if Hertz had written a book — I believe he did write quite a few articles — those become his autobiography. And the same was true of some very prominent scientists in radio — Zenecke in Germany is one I naturally think of because he was ahead of this country. I think we might say that the classical education in Europe was more encouraging toward writing and putting subjects on the record than it was in this country. I'd like to debate that sometime, but I think that is true in some degree. It is interesting that the things that originated in France or Germany that you would expect to originate in England or U.S., and the things that originated in England that you might expect the greater activity in the U.S. would have generated. For example, the word "radio" started in France. It was a French word reflecting radiation.
I don't quite follow your argument there. I understand that in Europe generally it was much more common to have a classical education with Greek and Latin and so on. And I can imagine that that might make these people maybe a little bit more inclined to write autobiographies. But I think you're making a larger point.
Well, that's a large part of what I was saying. The thing that's interesting to me is to point to specific instances. The word "radio," as I said, came from the French. "Wireless" was a negative term, and "radio" reflected radiation. And radio waves weren't originally called "radiation." They were just waves going from here to there. Then I think the higher education in Germany and France was more selective, and by that circumstance it was more intense. I've talked with many of my British friends; they're better educated by any standard than the engineers that I would associate with in this country. And I always enjoyed talking with them.
I know that the French receive a good deal more mathematics in their education than even the English.
And this was related to the dominant position of those countries in the history of their periods. But there's no question that the British education system educates fewer people and better. Incidentally, Marconi is an enigma. He was outside that system, outside the German and French axis. And Italy in itself was not all that dominant in science.
Although I think that their educational system is close to the French in form. I read in something that Hazeltine had written where he gave you great credit for the training of young engineers at Hazeltine Corporation. I wonder if you could explain your philosophy and approach in the training of young engineers.
It was selfish motivation. If we wanted to get results, we got the results best by engineers who were better trained and who were more interested in their work, which comes with training.
You've mentioned yesterday some of the instruction that you arranged in Hazeltine.
We carried the development of engineering in two periods far beyond what was current experience. One was in the Bayside laboratory, and that was in Hazeltine directly under my guidance. The second was in Wheeler Laboratories which was not in Hazeltine and which Hazeltine wouldn't have afforded. But it was under my guidance, and I had the luxury of affording it.
Something else I wanted to ask you about was your participation in IRE activities.
I'd like to go back just a minute to training engineers. Often I've been told that I should have been a teacher. I am bored at talking in front of a group — at them. My satisfaction has come from one-to-one education where I read the engineer's mind and interfaced directly with one mind instead of a group or instead of a textbook. I still think I would not have been outstanding as a teacher of classes.
I know that you joined IRE at a very early stage in your career — 1927, I believe it was. And much later you helped found the Long Island section of IRE, and you were chairman of that. Can you say what values you saw in IRE for you and for the electronics engineers?
First thing I should mention is that I should have joined much sooner. In 1927 — I think that's the year of my joining — I had been exercising initiative in the field since 1922, five years, and I had hardly heard of the IRE. It was negligence that my seniors in the company didn't put an application blank in front of me and say, "You should join." As soon as I really heard about it in 1926, I did join. And here it's interesting to recall that my membership number is 6000. Today the membership numbers are running around a million. There were about 3,000 members in the profession. They were almost all in the United States, and the leaders all knew each other. I soon came to know the leaders because they all made speeches in the New York section.
Was there a Washington section at that time?
Yes, but it never had the stature of the New York section.
The value for you derived from these meetings where you'd meet people and hear talks and from receiving publications and publishing yourself?
Yes. That was a great education to me as to how important things had happened.
That was a monthly meeting of the New York section?
Did you go to annual meetings?
Yes. As soon as I was aware of the Society, I very seldom missed an annual convention, and usually I made speeches there.
Did most of the Hazeltine engineers join IRE?
Yes. I might say that today there are two reasons that engineers are less inclined to automatically join IEEE. One, it's so big that they feel lost. The other is that the diversification within IEEE dilutes the communication opportunities of one engineer with the entire Society. The specialized societies, which are nearing a hundred, I guess, were a partial solution to that problem.
But even some of those are huge.
They're too big. A typical membership is a hundred thousand today, I guess.
In 1934 you were an IRE director. What did that involve?
That was a freak. The president in 1934 came from Minnesota and was a close friend of my family, and he had watched with great interest what I was doing. And so he evaluated me much higher than most of my colleagues, and he exercised his privilege of appointing one or more directors. So I was an appointed and not elected director. I contrast that to 1940 when I was elected by a large plurality, along with one or two of the real long-time members in the Institute, and I was only 37.
And you served as director for six years, is that right?
Yes, 1940-45.
Did you find that rewarding?
Oh, yes. I was really excited about the board of directors and the caliber of their members.
Was that also a time when IRE was growing rapidly?
Yes. During the war the increased attention to technology caused an explosive growth. And early in the war I introduced several innovations as a member of the board. One interesting note in passing: Before that time the IRE had sections and then had "no man's land" in between. I perceived that every engineer should be identified with a section, and I initiated that practice. I was the youngest member of the board; the older members hadn't been as perceptive. Then in the area of awards, the "Fellow" grade of member was awarded on application before 1940. You reached one level of experience and became a "Senior" member and paid more dues. You reached another level of experience and applied for a "Fellow" member and paid a higher level of dues. And I watched my ages — each one was age keyed — and I watched my ages so I could apply immediately to each higher grade as soon as I reached the age. And so in 1935 when I was 32 I reached the age that I could apply for a Fellowship. And I'm one of the few Fellows today who dates that far back. Very few, I might say. But that was not so much an honor as it was a matter of your personal conceit.
If you'd been in the profession long enough and were willing to pay higher dues.
So in the 'forties when I was on the board, we had committees that deliberated on these areas. I was just delighted in that Society. Among other things we talked about the awards. There were two awards at that time. One was the major award, Medal of Honor, which had been inaugurated soon after the Institute was formed, and was presented first in 1917. Then somewhat later around the end of World War I, a member of the Institute was killed in action, and in 1919 his family contributed a fund to deliver an award in his name. That was the Liebmann Prize. Unlike the Medal of Honor, which was awarded only in the form of a medal and a diploma, the Liebmann Award had a small cash award along with it. It was a less pretentious award than the Medal of Honor, awarded typically to younger men who were responsible for innovation or remarkable results in some field. For example, the initial work on waveguides was rewarded by the Liebmann Prize. Whereas a wider sphere of activities and contribution carried the Medal of Honor. For years the Medal of Honor went to giants in our growing profession. The first one given 1917 went to Armstrong. That gives you some idea of the stature.
Alexanderson, Marconi, Fessenden, De Forest, Hammond and Southworth received it. You, of course, received it in '64.
Yes. Hammond was one of the inventors of all time, and Southworth was more the engineer like I was.
You also served on IRE's Board of Editors for many years.
Yes. Around the time I was on the Board of Directors. Usually the Board of Editors was headed by a more experienced engineer in the profession, and by that time I qualified.
You helped establish the Long Island.
Yes. As we said, during the war the membership had increased very rapidly. After the war there were enough members in each of a number of areas to justify an identified organization. Yes. At that time my work on Long Island was in an area with a very large activity of the profession. There was a New York Section but it was not ideally located for those on Long Island to have access. So three of us independently perceived the need for a Long Island section. Two of the founders worked for Sperry, so they were close together, then by accident in conversation with me they discovered that I also was thinking along those lines. So the three of us founded the Long Island section. One of them, I might say, was already a director and a leader in the New York section, and the other two of us were relatively new and we became the first and second chairmen of the new Long Island subsection of the New York section. It wasn't long before the number of engineers and the growth of engineering in our area justified making Long Island an autonomous section, which held its own regular meetings.
I wanted to ask also about your membership in the Radio Club of America. Do you recall when you joined that?
It must have been around 1935. Incidentally, that was the year that Hazeltine received the Armstrong Medal from the Radio Club. Also around that time he was president of IRE. At any rate, the Radio Club, as the name implies, was mostly men with radio amateur background. Some had lost their amateur standing, but they were still amateurs at heart. That's still true today. Armstrong was one of those. I was not very active in the Club because my amateur activities were very early and very limited.
Did you cease your amateur activities when you went to work for Hazeltine?
Before that time I was pretty much out of that field. I liked it, but it was just playing around. I was going for the gold. I nevertheless joined the Radio Club, because the amateurs became — a powerful community in the technology of radio.
What did you gain by joining the Radio Club?
They published papers. They could not compete with IRE but it was a good avenue of publication.
They were useful to you?
Hazeltine published his first paper on the heterodyne in the Radio Club largely because he was acquainted with the members. Some of my papers were presented to the Radio Club where they were received well. Then its membership included many famous men in the field. I guess I was made a Fellow of the Radio Club very early, but I won't try to remember the year. In the year that I received the Medal of Honor from IEEE — the new merged organization — Radio Club also awarded me the Armstrong Medal, which Hazeltine had received many years earlier. I considered that also a very great distinction.
Did you often attend meetings of the Radio Club?
Not really often. Their meetings were not as often nor as organized as the IRE. But I enjoyed the ones I did attend. I enjoyed affiliating with the men who were amateurs at heart.
Why did you join the AIEE?
The progress of communications was very strong in AIEE, largely in the field of the telephone company. In the IRE that was the main topic of the organization. Well, as communication technology developed, for example, circuit theory, there was a large interplay between power technology and communications. Incidentally Professor Hazeltine had his introduction through the power field. I don't know as a matter of fact, but he was probably a member of AIEE before he was IRE. Maybe before IRE existed. But anyway as I became more and more active in circuit theory, I saw that it was a very active area in the AIEE; they were holding meetings, and some meetings I contributed to.
Were these telephone engineers?
Largely. And of course telephone engineering matured long before radio. So that was a very powerful organization in the communications profession, but it was diluted by the fact that it was also power oriented. It was that interplay that influenced me to join the AIEE, and I was shortly made a Fellow.
Did you often go to meetings of AIEE?
Not very often. Usually meetings where I was participating.
Did you find their publications useful?
In my area of interest, much less so than IRE. We were talking about Beverage earlier, and his classical paper on the Beverage antenna was published in AIEE. That reflected the fact that in General Electric they had a wider base of power and technology, and AIEE was the more common avenue for membership in their group of engineers.
Given that you were a Fellow in both societies, I imagine you were pleased with the merger in '64.
I had mixed reactions. I objected mainly because the people promoting the merger were not honest as to one of its real motivations. IRE had a lot of money, and AIEE was broke. One selfish motivation in promoting the merger was to help AIEE survive. I didn't like the merger to be advertised on grand altruistic motives when I knew that the immediate motivation was not being publicized. Now other than that, I think I was a little jealous of IRE's ascendancy in the field. They had become the stronger organization, and maybe I was a little jealous of that predominance. But as time went on, I fully realized that it was a good thing.
At the time of the merger your staff gave you a button?
Because I was less than enthusiastic about the merger at that time, I threatened to get my engineers an IRE pin made with the left-hand rule instead of the right-hand rule. So they quickly got an AIEE button to avoid disgracing the laboratory. Over my lifetime I have made many indiscreet remarks — some of which I deeply regretted later on, and some of which I merely wrote off as growing pains. And I guess that was one such remark.
You were also a member of the American Physical Society?
Yes. That was automatic for graduate students in the physics department at Johns Hopkins, in the physics department of any university. So I tracked their proceedings, and this was in the day before the explosion of quantum developments and atom busting, so I was interested. Some of the principal inventors in radio were primarily members of the American Physical Society. For example, the screen grid tube was invented by people who were primarily Physical Society members. So my first talks were before the American Physical Society. And some of my first and only publications were abstracts published in a program of the American Physical Society.
How long did you maintain your connection with APS?
Not long after I left Hopkins because I became completely immersed in the IRE.
Did people working in vacuum tubes migrated to IRE rather than stay in APS?
Yes. That was because the applications became dominant. The division between science and engineering is a fascinating one from many angles. It's interesting that in the Department of Physics at Johns Hopkins I don't think they had the Proceedings of the IRE. I think that was in the Engineering Department, and I hardly saw it until my later years.
I wouldn't be surprised if that situation is not so changed today. It seems that the physicists are not that much aware of what's going on in engineering. Although I think communication in the other direction is quite good.
They accede to the many opportunities in engineering quite frequently.
One generalization I've heard is that the connection between engineering science and physics is closer today than it was. Do you agree?
It's hard to distinguish between them today. Engineering papers involve highly-involved physics theories, quantum developments, all those things. In the days of the vacuum tube, the physicists contributed to filaments with greater emission, methods of evacuation, things like that, which the engineer then took for granted. But when it came to transistors, there was a complete change from that situation because transistors could not be understood without basic physics. Here I can't resist a comment I make frequently: In the development of transistors it became clear that the prime workers in that field were unfamiliar with vacuum tubes. Sure they used them, they'd heard of them. But when it came to describing the transistor as an amplifier, they invented a new series of terms. And the result was great confusion in the initial absorption of transistors into communications.
With time it appeared clear to me that if they had adopted the terminology of vacuum tubes that they would have avoided the necessity for many textbooks. [Laughter] They were directed to teaching the engineer a new terminology. And more and more they found they could make transistors that behaved like vacuum tubes. The first ones were enough different so that it wasn't a natural realization that they could be described like vacuum tubes. So the adoption of transistors might have been a good deal faster if the terminology had been taken from vacuum tubes. The first thing I had to do in appreciating the behavior of transistors was to translate it to a similar behavior in vacuum tubes. That was not easy because the transistor behavior was not the most common behavior we used in vacuum tubes. But today we have transistors that behave very much like vacuum tubes. And if anything, they are the more common. But it took a long time to realize that. It's as if two psychologists developed a new terminology, each one to suit himself, and the student had to learn both because the natural innovation in terminology is not the same in two different people.
What connections have you had in the course of your career with engineers doing research in academic settings?
That question confuses me a bit because I remember a time when graduate students in engineering were almost as proficient in mathematics and some other areas of science as the physicist. One incident stands out during that period. Fred Seitz, onetime head of National Science Foundation, wrote a book in the late 'thirties on the physics of solids. And that was right smack on the area of crystal detectors that had been common in radio twenty years earlier. It was, I think, the keystone of transistor development. Now he was a professor — an outstanding professor, an outstanding scientist — and he had good engineering sense. All I know is that book was a milestone in the direction of transistors. That was an area where engineers were not well informed and I think he brought a higher level of education in engineering circles as a result of that book. I guess one would have to say the book was written primarily for physicists, but I'm not sure about that because he had good engineering sense.
Did you often find the articles written by the people on the engineering faculties at MIT or Hopkins useful?
We shouldn't mention them in the same breath. Hopkins engineering was an incident in their curriculum, in their institution. Whereas engineering was basic in MIT. The Hopkins engineering was rather superficial; it was power oriented even more than communications; and it wasn't very well attended. I would have been out of my element in that engineering school. I think I was in my element in the physics department. I just couldn't keep up with it in the days of quantum theory. So they were entirely different. MIT however was an engineering institution from the origin, and very different from the institutions like Princeton and Harvard that emphasized basic physics. Harvard graduated many inspired engineers, but their engineering education was not in a class with MIT. They just had a few geniuses in the department. So that demarcation has blurred over the years because the physicists found themselves impelled to use advanced technology in their experiments. You couldn't be pure physicists anymore such that you could do your own glass blowing and set up an experiment in your laboratory.
Then on the other extreme the engineers became more and more reliant on basic physics, and the transition I would say occurred in a small way in the early days of television when television tubes were far different from ordinary vacuum tubes. But then it developed during the war when the super heterodyne receiver used crystal converters. Now why crystal converters when they had tubes that would do the same job? Well, they didn't. The tubes did the same job for lower frequencies, but in higher frequencies they were impelled to make things smaller and smaller. So the crystal converter in wartime performed a function the tubes couldn't perform. That was the beginning of transistors. As I can remember when I first discovered in a crystal converter that they were non-reciprocal — that's like an amplifier — and that it would deliver more power in one direction than the other. That was the beginning of transistors when people more aggressive than I perceived that and became more competent in solid state. So solid state really had a boost in the converters used in radio sets during the war.
Along those lines what are your views on research by grants.
I think it's fair to say postwar development probably had its origin in developmental contracts by the military. Those contracts had a mixed history. It was difficult in the military to define forward-looking developments. The military organization did not make it any easier. So that during the war the military people came to appreciate the need for subsidized developments to meet military needs. Immediately after the war that was done in the form of development contracts. Some of those had much freedom, and some very valuable information was accumulated on contracts like that. In the case of Bell Telephone Laboratories, they had the stature and the resources to make developments without a subsidy. But outside the smaller companies and even the larger companies hesitated to make that investment without any return that they could identify.
So the government development contracts in the 'fifties became a much wider-based system of grants. Grants were more liberal than contracts, which tended to insist on some result [wanted at a particular tune and oriented to a purpose] which meant automatically a restriction of innovation. The system of grants as we know it today, I think it's fair to say, is not keyed to any particular technology, any particular science or any particular motivation as to practical results. The results of many of the grants — although a minority — have been outstanding contributions to science and technology. More and more the universities came to rely on grants to support graduate education with very little reliance on the value of the result. So you see many graduate thesis papers where it's hard to define any objective toward a useful result. That has filtered a very large amount of money into the universities, which was spent on thesis advisors and scholarships. It had the very unfortunate byproduct of evaluating professors in terms of their ability to obtain grants. I think that's one of the most degrading phenomena in academia today because it is not linked to useful grants; it's linked to prying money from government agencies into the academic coffers.
Yes. But a professor's ability to win grants is generally related to his perceived success in research, and that may be shown in the publications that he writes and perhaps in other ways. Are you saying that the work that gets done under these grants is not particularly valuable in many cases?
Not in the terms of the grant. If you're going to indulge in innovation, it can't be described in advance. The grants insist on a level of description, which is supposed to be followed, and let's say it's honored in the breach. But it's supposed to be followed toward a predictable result, and a predictable result is not innovation. So it would be better if the money were spent supporting talented people to innovate as opportunity allowed.
We ought to say: How did progress in technology grow? And the first thing we see is that before World War II there weren't any grants. I think that's literally true. And that meant that a powerfully motivated innovator had to scrounge for support and for students to help him. And you could say that that inhibited a growth of technology. And I can't give you an argument on that. Certainly there were opportunities for more investment in innovation. And before the war those were almost entirely in the research laboratories of large companies, not in the universities.
Doesn't the fact that we now have a large number of engineers and graduate students doing engineering research in universities mean that innovation is taking place at a much faster rate?
Sometimes it's hard to define what you mean by innovation; sometimes I would rate it very low. In my experience reviewing papers for IRE, numerous ones are the result of a grant where the student promised to do some work, promised to publish it. A professor promised to encourage him. Their two names appear on a paper, which is useless. That's all too common. And then reviewing papers, I have been unkind enough to give that reaction at times when I'm sure it was very disappointing to the people involved, but I'm going to say, usually deserved.
How might that situation be improved?
That's the $64 question. In many areas, like the Supreme Court, I am extremely critical. I have, I think, a constructive approach to the evaluation, but to solve a problem is very difficult. How can you get enough money into universities so as to support the degree of freedom that we took for granted before World War II?
Of course one of the things is that the research itself is so much more expensive.
The cost of materials and other expenses that have to be met. A professor in 1925 could — even if there was no a budget — could scrounge the materials to do his experiments.
Yes. A physicist in the 'twenties would do his own glass blowing. And the result was much progress made by crude devices and advanced concepts. But then when the concepts matured into very critical evaluations of the results and the equipment, the days of amateur science disappeared. I think Land is an example of achieving the results with the least support and encouragement and a maximum result. But there are very few opportunities for a Land, and there are in any profession some examples that are beyond belief. In the area of electronics and engineering, Harold Edgerton is one of those. In school with very inexpensive equipment, he demonstrated his flash photography. He started at a time when he was young and ambitious at a time when technology was available. And he made a few experiments, which attracted very much attention. Then there developed a demand for it in technology so he began to make more sophisticated equipment. And by concentrating now in this one field over a lifetime, he exceeded the critical mass a few times. And, yes, he became prosperous, but it was a perfect example of someone following a restricted course in which the restrictions were largely removed by the rapid expansion of his applications. He wouldn't have thought of his organization as being called on to analyze the atomic bomb. But he had the technology that was more and more in need. By sticking to that one path, he accomplished miracles in one lifetime.
In your book you describe your early years in Mitchell, South Dakota, and the move to Washington, DC. At what point did you marry and establish your own home?
First I want to emphasize that whatever success I've had in my career was very largely indebted to my parents and my wife. Without that support, I'd have been severely handicapped. Now in my book Early Days I cover my childhood in Mitchell, South Dakota, and my high school and college in Washington, DC. In college I met Ruth Gregory whose father was a career naval officer just then promoted to rear admiral as Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks. He was in the Civil Engineers' Corps. So that's how she happened to move to Washington and go to George Washington University. We went together during the latter years of our university work, and then afterwards I was studying at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. And the year after she and I graduated we were married and moved to an apartment in Baltimore where our first child was born. From then on the family was close to me in my career.
Was it considered inappropriate at that time for a woman to marry and continue to go to college? Is it for that reason that you waited until she graduated?
No, I don't think there was any inhibition there. It was unusual, but there was no objection. It was mainly so that it wouldn't interfere with her education. She was a marvelous wife and support and a perfect hostess in our home for our many visitors, including my professional visitors. Many of them remember their luncheon or dinner at our home as one of the high spots of their contacts with us during the war. So we enjoyed sixty years of happy married life before she died five years ago.
You built a home in Great Neck, New York?
Yes, when it became apparent that I was going to be working on Long Island. Then we were living in Jackson Heights, and we found a lot in Great Neck and built a nice new house which we occupied for 40 years and in which we raised our three children.
You were happy with that community?
Yes, in those days, but not today.
Where did you move when you left that house?
At that time our company, Wheeler Laboratories, was shrinking, and we concentrated our duties in our field station in Smithtown, Long Island. So I found a new home near there, and that's where I spent the remaining 17 years before I retired.
Why did you decided to retire to the West Coast?
One of our two daughters had a large family, which was based first in Santa Barbara and later in various locations on the West Coast. So we had always intended to retire to that area to be near her family.
I wanted to ask you about the influence of your parents on your career.
My parents were, let us say, the perfect couple for raising a family and giving them every opportunity. My four younger sisters and I were cared for very well, first in Mitchell, South Dakota and then Washington, DC. And I cannot overemphasize the advantage of that healthy family environment in all my career and in giving me an opportunity to develop my talents and to pursue my activities.
I suppose that your father's being a scientist may have influenced you in that direction.
It certainly gave him a better opportunity to advise me because he early recognized that I was headed in that direction. And he gave me excellent advice at various stages. I remember when I was about twelve, I ran across his college physics book in a bookcase. So I sat down one morning and learned everything in the book. By that time the technology had advanced so far beyond that the book was elementary.
Did any of your sisters go in the direction of science or technology?
My second sister, Margaret, taught science in high school and later in university. She went to George Washington University like my other sisters and was very close to the physics department where she was teaching at some times.
I would like to ask you about the great deal of work that you've done in the area of test equipment and development of measuring devices in electronics.
Very early I perceived that all the work I was doing was subject to testing, and there was very little testing equipment available. So typically I had to devise tests to meet the immediate requirements. The testing and measuring equipment that I had in my home laboratory was very rudimentary, but I found ways to utilize it.
When I went to work full time with the company in the Hoboken laboratory in 1928, all of us perceived that the design work we were doing needed testing methods and equipment, which were not available. So my first assignment on reporting for work full time was to develop a new standard signal generator for testing radio receivers. We made one that was far in advance of anything available in those days or anything in use in other companies. And it was a great help. The greatest need was for a standard signal generator for use in testing the RF sensitivity and the audio performance of a receiver. The success of the design that we worked out was largely due to my assistant mechanical engineer, who actually designed the equipment with my guidance where there were electrical problems.
Incidentally, in component design or in the design of individual RF stages, there were lots of incidental tests that had to be made. And I worked on the specialized equipment for those tests. Then continually throughout my experience in the 'twenties and 'thirties, it was just one parade of new test equipment involving much innovation and much ingenuity on my part and on the part of my colleagues.
And this is because you felt the design work that you were doing would greatly benefit from these measurements and special test devices?
Yes. Design efficiency required test equipment that was both adequate and efficient, that was easily operated and gave quick results. And those were not the common characteristics of test equipment in those days.
Because that was a new area of technology, I would imagine there were no companies producing specialized test equipment.
And I think it would also be fair to say that most test equipment had been designed very casually without any real ingenuity. And that was a handicap in engineering. It's very different from today when you look in the Hewlett Packard catalog and if you can afford it, you immediately find the equipment that's very efficient.
What was the dissemination of information about test and measurement devices in those days?
There was something in the textbooks and handbooks. The General Radio Company had made some test equipment that was the best available. You might say they carried on in radio what the Leeds Northrop Company had performed in the earlier electrical engineering. But they had to design to a price, and the equipment was usually rather simple — some ingenuity, but not efficient to use many times.
These innovations, which you describe in your book Early Days, that you and others at Hazeltine were responsible for, were those described in publications or patent applications?
In the case of our standard signal generator which was our first monumental achievement, the answer is no. The only records were our company reports on the design and operation of that equipment. In later days some equipment reached the public press — not all. It was not in the category of engineering advances in terms of applications and use, so it was less interesting in that respect.
And the field was not large enough that there was a real market, say, for the signal generator?
We were not oriented to distribution. I think we considered now and then whether we should duplicate the equipment for sale. We weren't too anxious to equip other laboratories to compete with us. And the equipment was highly specialized, expensive, and I think there would not have been much market.
Here I should mention one exception to these rules. During the 'twenties and 'thirties, of course, we were designing to other companies that were competing with each other and with outside companies. In the latter half of the war when we were active in the Mark V program, that was opening up a new frequency band for which there was no available test equipment. We not only made the necessary test equipment, but in one case I'll mention at least a hundred of these sets were made and distributed to the participating companies in that program.
This was what we called a slotted line. The slotted line refers to a method of measuring impedance by connecting the unknown impedance at the end of a transmission line and measuring the standing-wave ratio on a slotted line. That was a very laborious process with makeshift equipment. Here again, the mechanical engineer who had helped me before designed an inspired mechanical design for that purpose. Immediately the project ordered about a hundred of these sets for use everywhere that they were opening up this new frequency band around a thousand megahertz.
Do you think that Hazeltine put more effort in this direction of test and measurement than other research establishments in those years?
Yes. A principal effort outside the company was only in large companies, notably General Electric. They made some ingenious equipment for testing they wanted to do, but they didn't go anywhere near as far in making test equipment that would save time and effort.
Were you well informed on what GE was doing in that area?
Yes. I was active in the IRE standards area, and some of the people working on that were members of our committees.
When did your work with the IRE Standards Committee begin?
In the early 'thirties Professor Hazeltine was active on the Standards Committee. I think that was a factor, which led to our interest in it. So in the early 'thirties when we became well known for our measurements and design of radio receivers, I was made chairman of the Technical Committee on Radio Receivers under the IRE Standards Committee. It was the 1938 report of that committee that disseminated our ideas on testing and which became a bible of testing radio receivers, which is still in use today. And the most remarkable incident was, that became the first standard that was translated into a foreign language. It was translated into Spanish for use in Argentina. It was notable at the time because my philosophy of testing differed from the time-honored philosophy of the Standards Committee. They had taken as their mission, the recording of existing testing methods. I also took as our challenge the introduction also of new methods where they were needed. That met with mixed reaction on the Standards Committee, but my ideas prevailed. That became a monumental achievement in the Institute.
Does that mean that there's a good deal more work on the committee to reach agreement?
Not necessarily. I was recording tests that we were making in our laboratory that no one else was making at that time. It's notable to remark on the difference today when Hewlett Packard has equipment specifically designed for efficient operation in all these fields and using the latest technology, but unfortunately it is very expensive.
Did that come to be the usual philosophy on IRE Standards Committees after that?
I hesitate to answer that because after the war things became complicated, and I think there might have been less attention diverted to the Standards Committees.
When did you become chairman of the Standards Committee?
After our famous report from the Radio Receivers Committee, I was elected to the board of directors and a natural choice for successor chairman to the Standards Committee. I served from 1940 to 1945. I had illustrious predecessors in both of these positions who became close friends, naturally. In the Receivers Committee it was Dickey of RCA. In the Standards Committee it probably was one of the outstanding men in the telephone company.
Was it difficult to be chairman of the Standards Committee given that it was wartime?
During the war, the engineering talent was largely preempted by World War II so the activities of the Standards Committee were curtailed. After the war I lost contact, and I think a different philosophy prevailed. There were many new standards needed, and I did not follow those very closely.
Did your concern for test and measurement continue in the decades after the war?
Yes. At Wheeler Laboratories we paid much attention to ingenious and efficient methods of testing. In those days even without invention the testing required an inordinate amount of time and effort because we were opening up new fields of frequency and methods.
Do you recall when the marketing of test equipment began?
I think the early days of television gave much impetus to that. During the war the work on radar and other military projects was a great impetus to test equipment. The Rad Lab, for example, must have innovated a great deal in that field. And after the war with the advent of Hewlett Packard, the design and marketing of test equipment entered a new era, giving it importance enough so that it was a major investment in research.
I'd like now to turn to the topic of television. Hazeltine was, of course, one of the most important companies in the early development of television. Could you summarize how you came to be involved in that and your particular contributions?
Well, in the early 'thirties our laboratory initiated a major effort in the development of vision receivers. We were the first company, outside of RCA, to have a television signal generator for testing receivers. I became one of the leaders in analyzing the circuit problems of television receivers, notably wideband amplifiers and circuits for scanning. It came to a halt with the war. After the war, of course, the principles remained valid. The main event after the war was transistors where half the problems of amplifiers didn't exist anymore. Before the war much of my effort was devoted to using vacuum tubes to cover our frequency band. With transistors that became easy. I was not engaged in that kind of design at that time.
How did a standard arise for all the features of the television system?
That's a long story. Before the war we became aware of the problems and developed only makeshift solutions. After the war, outside of my work, which was along different channels, the same line of development continued until transistors changed the whole picture.
Did Hazeltine have contact with RCA in arriving at standards or was IRE active in trying to establish standards.
I don't doubt all the major companies were involved in that activity right after the war, but I was not. Before the war there was little joint activity. Mostly it was regarded as competitive. We were developing knowledge of a subject. The problems of television were not common knowledge before they were met in the television development. In the late 'thirties the principal concern was in improving the technology and in getting a system that would work and not so much concern that the entire industry arrive at a standard.
Is it because of the work that Wheeler Laboratories undertook after World War II that you didn't stay in the television field?
You mentioned in your book that with regard to the early work in television that there were some other innovators — whose work paralleled yours in certain respects: William Percival, Blumlein and Walter Roberts. Could you comment on this?
Most of these were British inventors who had a head start in television in England. The ones in this country were contemporary, and a few worked on the same problems I did and came up with similar answers — notably in the RCA laboratory (Roberts).
It's not surprising to hear of nearly simultaneous — independent invention.
It was a unique situation in history that Great Britain had a year head start and that I often ran into inventions made by a British engineer a year before I did. I didn't know of it at the time of my invention. That was a result of the British government subsidy of television, which gave it the year head start over our laborious process. That gave them a head start when radar was needed and was literally was responsible for defeating the German Air Force in the early days of the war.
What was the connection between television development and radar?
Both utilized what we came to call pulse techniques. In television, pulses of current made spots on the picture that built up the picture. In radar, pulses were the transmitted radar signal and the received reflection. So there was a great deal of commonality in those two fields. So as soon as the British recognized the need for radar, they drafted their engineers not in the army but in the laboratories to work on these subjects. That was after the inventions I'm talking about. Our government, on the other hand, drafted engineers for the firing line. We had continual dilution of effort in trying to save our engineers from being drafted.
They were drafted and in some cases served in ordinary capacities as soldiers?
More typically they were sent to boot camp, and then in the meantime, the wheels were set in motion to bring them back into creative work, sometimes at the salary of a private, working along [with] engineers which were paid civilian salaries. One bright engineer, whom I was particularly acquainted with, was sent to boot camp just when we needed him worst. When he returned, and he worked alongside of commissioned officers assigned to our project from the Army and Navy; usually he was telling them how to do it.
So that was a real problem for Hazeltine.
Yes. It was one of the many examples of shortsightedness on the part of the government.
Now of course Hazeltine did very important work with IFF. Was it common for the engineers elsewhere working on development of television to contribute to the radar effort during the war?
So one could recruit from those also:
Well, usually it was the same laboratory; we just reoriented the work of the laboratory. Rad Lab was a special case, of course, where they recruited brilliant scientists and engineers from all professions and gave them a new set of problems. Some of them were scientists who had to learn engineering from scratch; and they were very quick to learn.
How has the popular image of the engineer changed over your lifetime?
That's not easy to answer. I think there may have been a period that I would find it hard to identify when the propaganda rated pure scientists higher than practical engineers. I think there were also periods when the reverse was true because the engineers were doing things you could see while the scientists may have been working on theories. So the popular view of those things, in my experience, was all on the part of the layman at the things that they were seeing and using as a result of engineering.
I would guess that in your youth, Thomas Edison was celebrated as a great engineer.
Yes. The first phonograph I ever heard was in Mitchell around 1913 when one of my friends who had a little more money than the rest of us purchased an Edison phonograph with the cylinder record. I don't recall to what extent Edison's overall prolific contributions were a matter of common knowledge.
Was he something that youngsters look up to and perhaps seek to emulate?
I think there was not so much knowledge of the current history, so it's hard to answer that question.
His light bulb invention must have been celebrated, and of course the kinescope and phonograph.
I know that right after World War I there was a worldwide enthusiasm for physics, largely because of Einstein's general relativity and confirmation of one prediction of the eclipse. That may have contributed to the rising status of pure science. Do you recall Einstein's popularity at that time?
Well, I don't think popularity is the right word. And I don't think there was such wide recognition of what he was doing because it was something nobody could understand. The physicists didn't understand it, but they learned some rules, which is all he was working with. So those things were largely privy to the scientific community. Sure, his name became well known, but people didn't quite know what he did.
Do you recall if, for example, during World War II or, shortly thereafter, engineers had a higher popular status than earlier?
Yes. There's no question that the public became aware that technology was the determining factor in the war. It's interesting to look back to World War I. The innovation which came into play in World War I was hard to imagine today. First, the single-seat aircraft were put into service. The pilot would toss the bomb out from the cockpit, and a little later he would shoot a machine gun through the propeller blades and hope he wouldn't cut the blades off. It happened that I had an older cousin who was an engineer working on synchronizing machine gun with propeller blades. He was lost by submarine during the war. One of the innovations in World War I was the tank. That was a secret weapon of the British, and a very large factor in defeating Germany. Communications were rudimentary. They were a large factor because something was better than nothing.
One story I like: Communications in those days usually meant you had a telephone wire and a stake in the ground for the return circuit. The Germans with their superior amplifiers did better in those fields, but they were mystified when they heard a peculiar whistle on the telephone lines that they could not explain. It was kind of like "PEW!" And they gave up until after the war. Some of the scientists who had been aware of it excited their curiosity again, and they discovered that those signals were lightning flashes from Africa which were focused through the ionosphere back into the German area. The pulse was distorted into that form of a whistle in the process. They had a long-distance lightning detector there. People don't realize that there are many lightning flashes every minute in the world. And if you can get them, you have a symphony.
Wasn't the radio used at some point as a lightning detector?
Well, I don't have a quick answer for that. Yes, we heard lightning on the radio. Yes, we soon became aware that in some cases the areas of lightning storms, of which the Gulf of Mexico is the world champion, were a limitation on our radio communications. There's one incident that's relevant to your question. Some scientists were working on lightning detectors in order to predict the onset of electric storms. And one of those efforts became what they called a coherer when Branley, I guess, discovered that if you put a pulse of current through a tube of metal filings, the filings would attract each other and change the conductivity. So that coherer was invented as a detector to predict electric storms. Well, that became probably the first radio detector because radio waves have similar properties. And that's what was used in Marconi's first transmission across the Atlantic. That's before we had crystal detectors.
To return to the status of engineers in society, in the 'sixties and 'seventies when there was an anti-technology movement in the colleges and universities, did you perceive a lowered standing or a lowered image of engineers?
It's hard to describe what happened. Partly it was a reaction against technology as an instrument of war. I think some other reactions were just plain jealousy. It's hard to describe what happened. There was a time when there was less effort to develop engineers...and that shortly subsided.
When you were growing up and when you were in high school, did you imagine that you would become a physicist or an engineer?
First, I don't know which I did. Secondly, I didn't think in terms of a physicist. I could see what was developing in engineering, and that was what I was pursuing. I was fortunate in pursuing physics education because engineering was deficient in scientific background. I had some head start there, nothing extremely influential. It's significant that research laboratories like GE, which were strong in physics, became leaders in engineering, especially in communications.
A final question about the status of the profession: Do you recall when you were a youth the relative standing of the different professions of doctor and lawyer and engineer or scientist, the relative standing of those?
No, I didn't pay attention. And it's notable that doctors and lawyers in those days weren't envied for their income as they are today. And I just don't remember those factors. I do remember that the general public was simply awed with the technological achievements that were happening year after year. And I think radio broadcasting was one that excited the greatest awe on the part of the lay population. It came close to home — literally.
I suppose that that was a period when daily life was changing probably more rapidly than almost any other period.
Are we talking about the early days of broadcasting?
I was thinking of the 'twenties was also the period when the automobile was becoming standard.
Other things were not changing at a spectacular rate. Yes, we had the first mechanical refrigerator about 1916, and the first time we had a phonograph was then. Those things were a little expensive, but they were so much in demand that they became very common.
Another matter: You've written a bit about the notebooks that you and others kept at Hazeltine. I wanted to ask about the value of these notebooks for the engineering work, besides for establishing patents.
Keeping a record of developments was always extremely important and typically took a back seat to day-by-day experiments where you were in a hurry and couldn't take the time to write everything down. The major laboratories placed great emphasis on notebooks, where an ordinary manufacturing company probably wouldn't bother. I don't think the patent aspect was the primary motivation. And it was common experience that everything went in the notebook except just the last thing you did in a hurry to make it work, when you were too busy with the equipment to bother to write notes. In my old notebooks the entries at critical times are fragmentary. It's when you were just ambling along that you had time to write notes.
But you've kept your notebooks?
Yes. My principal notebooks over the years were such a large collection and of so little value to anyone else that I'm not quite sure what their status is today. I did not take them with me when I left the company.
Does Hazeltine have a policy of keeping all laboratory notebooks?
You might say as long as they're likely to be needed for patent support. But in all fairness it's been very seldom in my experience that the existence of notebooks was a major factor.
That didn't often play a large part in the cases that you were involved in?
The judges weren't in the habit of paying attention to notebooks. Incidentally, the Patent Office and the patent prosecution procedure did not require notebook records. Only in cases of conflict.
I see. How about the other uses of notebooks? I'm wondering just often, say, last year's notebook would be pulled out and referred to? Or how often other engineers at Hazeltine would use your notebooks?
There isn't any clear answer to that. My opinion is that the notebook is of little use to anyone except the person who writes it. And in some periods where I had efficient notebook record keeping, I kept pretty good records. Typically my notebook would be questions and answers, talking to myself and exploring alternatives. But too often the notebook was provided by the company in a form that was not conducive to keeping informal records. One frequent peculiarity of notebooks was that the bottom of every page had a place where it said, "Signed and Witnessed by" two engineers. Well, if you're keeping notebook pages by the hundreds, that's just left blank. And the fact of it being a misguided effort is constantly in front of the engineer [and] is counterproductive.
Here I'm referring to one of my laboratory notebooks in a style that I used at various times for many years. And this notebook covered the period from the middle of '25 to the middle of '26. In the summer of '25, as is entered somewhere in this notebook, I got the concept of automatic volume control. This is all pretty well documented in my book Early Days. But my first thinking of it was very rudimentary in terms of circuits. But gradually I concentrated on circuits that were useful and would yield a good result. Until late in '25 I planned to build a very sensitive super heterodyne receiver at my home in the Christmas holidays. It was an unusual kind of super heterodyne receiver, but that's covered in my book, and I'll pass over it. I went to work at the beginning of the Christmas holidays, and in two or three days put together a super heterodyne receiver that was far in advance of the current technology — an innovation in several ways. And it was intended to be a test bed for my AVC experiments.
Let me just mention that the automatic volume control was accomplished by developing a direct current voltage at the detector and applying it to reduce the gain in earlier RF stages. I had an elaborate circuit that would do that on the weakest possible signal, and I put that circuit together first, and it was too tricky to get it to work. It's interesting that, at that time, resistors of medium high value were not available. There were wire rheostats, there were carbon grid leaks of mega-ohm levels, but in between I needed some resistors that I couldn't buy. So I quickly gave up on that circuit, and I thought: Now what is the most rudimentary circuit that'll work here? And I suddenly perceived what was not common knowledge in the profession. That if I used a diode rectifier for the detector, I would also develop the control bias that I needed. I gradually appreciated more and more its good features. So I put that in my set, and it worked immediately. So on January 2, 1926 we find my entry of that circuit which I'd already put in my set. And that was demonstrated to three of my classmates at Hopkins who were at our house for a party during the holidays.
I see that they have witnessed the demonstration there.
Yes. And that entry and that witnessing were very fortunate in our subsequent litigation. Now that was a case where I was entering my experiments rather carefully because I was working on trying to find circuits that would work. This page was reproduced sometime later in historical articles, notably in one anniversary issue of Electronics magazine.
Is that known as automatic gain control today?
Yes. A more thoughtful name for it was automatic gain control. I called it automatic volume control because the audio frequency level control on the receiver was labeled "volume control," and it was that control that I wanted to supersede by an automatic control.
You've also kept a diary much of your life.
By accident, but very fortunately, someone presented me with a little pocket diary in my high school years for Christmas. I started very casually to jot down things I was doing each day. I was enough interested to continue the next Christmas and bought a diary for myself. I engaged in entries more and more over the years until I graduated to a normal-size diary, bound volume. It is interesting that I did not do what the stories in the literature describe about diaries. My diary was not an exposition of my current emotional problems and other things, just a fragmentary entry of things I did. Sometimes I have a hard time remembering what it was when I read the diary. But I continued that so I have a complete set of diaries that track my daily activities pretty much from high school to the present time.
Without large gaps?
One year I just didn't bother to get a new diary. I've regretted it ever since. So one year was missing. I think it was 1930. That convinced me that I shouldn't allow gaps.
You used these diaries in your historical writings?
Oh, very much. And in matters of personal interest. What year did I take a first trip to the West Coast? What was the airport when I began to fly west? When I arrived in LA, the airport was Burbank. Just a friendly little shack. So that's one of my treasures that I keep within reach all the time when I'm working.
What hobbies have you pursued?
I guess the first one you would identify would be when mechanical construction sets came out. On a Christmas around 1913 maybe, when I was ten years old, the boy next door had a mechanical construction set for a Christmas present. And I sat down in front of it, and they couldn't get me away from it even for dinner. My father promptly provided me with an adequate supply of sets like that, and that was a hobby that continued through high school. Not at a high level, but it was a challenge to make models of airplanes, battleships, things like that, with the equipment that was very rudimentary. Around the same time I became interested in stamp collecting. I think my relatives had some casual collections of a few stamps that they'd saved; the most common source of stamp collections in those days was letters from missionaries. And my interest in that grew until during my high school and college days I found time to accumulate quite a collection of U.S. and foreign stamps — both current and ancient. I inherited some of those collections of missionary stamps. So some of the stamps I have are really collectors' items these days. But it's hard to tell which ones.
I was also interested in music. My mother played the piano some and accompanied herself when she was singing. I guess her interest in music was the reason we as children were provided with piano lessons at an early age. I liked it very much, and I spent a great deal of time on the piano until high school days. Then after that it was very fragmentary, but a lot of time added up. What was my piano work? Well, when I was first taking lessons, my mother had a sheet music that was the latest thing on the shelf. It was the celebrated minuet by Paderewski. It was not vocal, just piano. I started to pick that out, and I liked it. So when I had a good music teacher some years later, I mentioned that. And she said that would be a wonderful composition for you to work on. It became my theme song and still is today.
You can still play that?
Yes. It's one of the few that I memorized well enough so that it survived the years. That was an interesting incident. I gravitated toward the classics — definitely not modern trends — and I memorized everything. I was not good at reading. In my high school days I had quite a remarkable repertoire of what you might call "easy classics." I could play by memory, and I enjoyed it very much.
You continued to play through life?
Off and on. My teacher at one stage wanted me to become a professional. I wisely decided that I would never have the discipline and the motivation to do the kind of work that professional musicians have to indulge in. I did it just for fun and not at any particularly high standard of performance, just good enough so I enjoyed it. And sometimes people liked to listen to it. Mostly my hobby was my interest in radio. And so in high school I had a very rudimentary radio amateur station with a spark transmitter, and I had a lot of fun. That also introduced me to radio sets, which was the beginning of my career. So a hobby became my career.
Those are the only examples I can think of. Before and after I was married I enjoyed ballroom dancing very much. Here again I could do it for fun, but I was not very proficient. Looking back I'm embarrassed, but I started in senior year of high school, and my wife-to-be and I enjoyed dancing very much. She was a natural follower. And I'd say that was our principal social interest over the years of our marriage up until the 1960's, I guess. Wheeler Laboratories was also a nice social institution. We had annual dinner dances to which all the employees were invited as guests of the company. That was a great factor in the social unit that the laboratory became. We had those, and we had a picnic for the children every summer. I'll meet today occasionally children that came to the picnic in their early years and remember it.
Could you describe the patent policy at Hazeltine.
Even before my association with Professor Hazeltine, I was interested in patents in a very childish way. A couple of times I wrote down something that may have been an invention. I called it an invention and got some people to witness it as I'd read about such things in books. It was after just a few incidents like that that I invented the neutralizing circuit.
Were the earlier inventions electrical?
Radio. I think I had a sense that that was a major development when I began writing down descriptions of it and getting people to witness it. Of course the romance of inventions was something we were aware of. When I made that invention before I met Professor Hazeltine, I was thinking, you might say for the first time, seriously in terms of patenting. It's interesting that I was working at the government laboratory, and the government had a policy of encouraging scientific personnel to make and patent inventions, to which they were granted the ordinary privileges — except the government had a free license.
That, incidentally, was a very intelligent policy. So, while working at the Bureau of Standards, I acquired the knowledge that made me aware of the problem of making a tuned radio frequency amplifier that was stable, because the inherent capacitance between grid and plate in a vacuum tube gave feedback that typically caused oscillations and made the amplifier much less useful. It is amazing, with that knowledge of the need, that a giant in the field didn't make this invention before I did. In the telephone company and General Electric, there were a couple of makeshift solutions to this problem that were patented but were not of any use in a broadcast receiver where the amplifier had to be tuned over a wide frequency range. So when I became aware of that problem and the senior engineers in the laboratory were among those who described the problem in the literature, I did something about it.
I'll always be mystified why they didn't do it before me. I said that if we put a reverse transformer in the plate circuit of a vacuum tube, we could couple back through a capacitor simulating the grid plate capacitance an equal and opposite feedback and make the amplifier stable. That is so simple that the court might well say it wasn't an invention. It was obvious. Most inventions are obvious, once you state the problem properly. So I made one at home with rudimentary coils, tested it, wrote up a description and took it to the office to ask some of the prominent engineers in the laboratory to witness it. How much they were immediately impressed by its significance, I'll never know. But I kept working on it at home. It was very shortly afterward that I met Professor Hazeltine and learned that he had made the invention on paper, had filed a patent application but had never made one.
This was an example of my awareness of patents but not much knowledge of how the system worked. When I met Professor Hazeltine, some occurrences had incited him to develop his invention, which he was in the process of doing when I met him. There was no Hazeltine Corporation yet. But his patent attorney perceived that this might be a very valuable invention and urged him to design a set that would have practical utility. That was largely the result of some incidents in the RCA picture.
RCA had a powerful patent position and was aggressive in warning other manufacturers not to use it without a license. They refused to license manufactures under the Armstrong regeneration, which was then the most common radio receiver. Mostly it was used by amateurs and tinkerers who just made it and didn't bother with a license. But the result of that licensing policy was that many small manufacturers who had been making cheap crystal sets were going out of business. They formed an association called the Independent Radio Manufacturers. The only large company in that association was Stromberg-Carlson Co. They organized on the advice of another member of our firm of patent attorneys. He talked with our attorneys, and they perceived that maybe the Hazeltine invention would give the Independent Radio Manufacturers a product that would compete with the RCA product. That proved to be the case. That was the immediate instigation of Professor Hazeltine making a thoughtful design for a radio receiver for broadcasting. He was in the process of doing that when I met him, and he completed the design shortly afterward. It went into wide use the following year — 1923 — and in some respects superseded the Armstrong regenerative circuit. It was more selective, it didn't have squeals and whistles, and it didn't have a critical adjustment necessary.
The wide acceptance of that design under Hazeltine license influenced our patent attorney to form a company to manage the Hazeltine patent and the licensing, and then incidentally provide engineering services because the small companies had very little engineering talent. So the Hazeltine Corporation was formed in February 1924. I was immediately employed part time, and shortly MacDonald was employed as chief engineer. Now when you talk about a patent policy, the original patent policy of the company was to exploit Professor Hazeltine's invention that had already been proved in success, both in the laboratory and commercially. Then the company adopted a more far-reaching policy of encouraging patenting first by the professor and then by the engineers in the company. Their pattern was to license a manufacturer under all their patents as a package, which were very few at first and then became numerous. And to accompany the license with the laboratory's engineering services to design radio receivers at a time when most of them were designed in a very elementary way.
The patents were all held by Hazeltine Corporation?
Yes. They were assigned to Hazeltine Corporation. Most of them didn't issue right away, of course. They took time. But the "patent pending" was a sort of promise of a license when the patent was issued. And some of the principal inventions were covered by issuing patents just a few years later. So to summarize, the patent policy was to build up a portfolio of patents in the radio field, which would influence a manufacturing company to take a license and pay royalties. The royalties were substantial but not a controlling factor on the price of the product.
That was what — a percentage of the price of the product?
Yes, a percentage of the value of the product, which included same part of the product not the cabinet, and not the loudspeaker. But it included the chassis that provided the amplifiers in the receiver, usually five tubes or so. And the royalty was 5%, and that continued for some years and was a sizeable income to the company but not spectacular.
It was the main source of royalties?
The source of income. It's interesting that they bought Hazeltine's patents for a million dollars, and the royalties never reached that level before the patent came to the end of its useful life five years later. By that time we had ambitions for other patents. Almost entirely on my inventions. So we persuaded the licensees to continue paying royalties and to benefit from our engineering services and the promise of future inventions.
Were you able to retain most of your licensees when the heterodyne era ended?
Yes. They were almost all patents on my early inventions, or most all-patent applications and later patents on my inventions. I might emphasize that our engineering reports were extremely valuable to our licensees. They were in one category specific reports on a performance of our licensees' engineering design, and in the other category they were reports describing improvements we were working on, some of which were adopted by them.
You said that the patent policy was not to patent innovations in test devices.
That policy occurred much later. I think in the early years, which meant mid-'twenties to mid-'thirties, we didn't rate our testing equipment as inventions. It was equipment designed to perform a function. It was not being sold; it was not manufactured by our licensees. And it was only in the 'thirties when I made some few spectacular inventions in the area of test equipment that the question arose. In the late 'thirties our patent attorney decided not to file for patents on test equipment. That was a mistake because it would have augmented our portfolio with some real inventions.
The reason for that decision was that it was expensive to file for patents?
It didn't really have a logical rationale. The attorney imagined that our improvements in receivers would be made in the millions and the test equipment would never be made in large quantities. I am afraid it reflected a kind of a prejudice in his mind against calling test equipment inventions. The first reaction of company policy to file patent applications had two motivations. One, our patent attorneys wanted the business. And two, to augment our patent portfolio with patents pending which might influence our licensees to stay with us in troubled times. The latter did happen. And the secret of our success in those years was the package license, which was accepted policy. RCA had a package license. In other fields there were package licenses. That was the only practical way to make a reasonable return on many patents. To litigate every patent was so difficult that it was ridiculous. Only the Congress and the courts would even consider such a thing. To summarize, our motivation was to have our portfolio increase at least the number of patents you could count in our package license. Those numbers passed a hundred sometime in the late 'thirties. Most of the patents were decent inventions, which never came into use because there was not a demand for that degree of perfection. That was the saddest reaction to many of my inventions.
Do you think that might have been different in a prosperous economic era?
Well, you might say you had to abandon the profit motive. Nobody was intending to do that. Some of the receivers we made in the laboratory and demonstrated to visitors in the 'thirties were marvelous achievements in simple control and automatic behavior. They involved receivers, which cost maybe twice as much as a rudimentary receiver, and our licensees were just not ready to put them in production.
Most of these patents you've been referring to were for radio receivers?
Yes. Improvements in the design and operation of radio receivers. The problem was inherently both simple and complicated. You wanted to be able to tune in a receiver and hear it, but you would rather not hear other signals on nearby channels. But you wouldn't pay very much money for that. You'd go to another station that didn't have interference. The heterodyne receiver, incidentally, was a marvel of selectivity compared with the Armstrong regenerative receiver. That was partly the secret of its immediate success — on the market.
Was that the main selling point in the advertising of that device?
That doesn't have a quick answer. The Armstrong receiver involved two or three controls, and they had to be set by reacting to conditions. And there was one very ingenious design by Westinghouse that involved a minimum of dependence on setting the regeneration control. But it had to be set critically for distance reception. So the heterodyne receiver was the first one where you could log the controls closely enough to reset them and receive the full amplification of the receiver. Now you say, why would the public pay for that? It wasn't all that expensive compared with the Armstrong receiver, and the result was spectacular. Also, it was made by companies that were competing with RCA price-wise.
What about television patents at Hazeltine?
In the 'thirties our television inventions were the subject of patent applications, and there were quite a few in the early days of television development. But there wasn't any pattern of marketing the receivers; they were just experimental. So in the 'thirties, yes, we had a few patents that were relevant to television, but there wasn't any widespread use because there was not a television system. Then the war came along, and after the war the situation was entirely different. After the war the company made some effort to build a patent portfolio in television with some spectacular success in the days of color television.
How did the patent policy at Wheeler Laboratory differ from that of Hazeltine in the 'thirties?
First we didn't have any patent attorneys that were anxious to have business. Secondly, we didn't market anything for sale. So there were just a few cases where there was a reason, and we applied for a patent application on an invention made in Wheeler Laboratories. These were cases where the invention was quite important, and our client had a reason for wanting it patented. The patent was assigned to the client. There were a few cases where the patent was assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories and a few cases where it was assigned to another client. The total number was not very large. I influenced our policy a little in view of the motivation that an engineer might receive by having a patent application filed in his name. But the number still did not build up to a large number.
But it was never the thought that Wheeler Labs would be supported by patent royalties the way Hazeltine had been?
No. And the ones we filed, aside from motivating the inventor, had little prospect of real royalty interest on the part of the client.
Could you comment on the patent policy of Hazeltine Corporation after the war?
I think it's fair to say that they were not motivated to file applications on everything that was invented because they no longer had the policy of licensing as a package. The reason was that that invited trouble, as they later experienced.
Didn't they continue that policy with the television patents?
I think the policy was that any important invention that was not supported by the government they intended to patent. And that left quite a few candidates because our television staff was very prolific in inventions, and some of them appeared to be important. I probably should say: How about patent applications on improvements under government contract? There was not much incentive to obtain a patent and then give the government a free license. Here again, the motivation of the inventor was a factor, and quite a few patent applications were filed because they were thought to be important even if not immediately profitable. Just a few applications were filed on inventions I made during the period after I rejoined the company. The most remarkable was my last invention and one of my greatest patents, which immediately went into use and became important. Unfortunately, that patent was contested, and the court decided in its infinite wisdom that it was not an invention. So the patent became invalid.
That was the array antenna.
Yes. The array antenna for triggering the altitude-coded beacon on aircraft. And it is seen today on top of every rotating radar at airports....
You have five categories of inventions. Would you explain that?
Yes. In reviewing the subject I jotted down these significant categories: One is a major invention that came into wide use. The second is a real invention that had little or no use. The third is a marginal invention that came into wide use. The fourth is major invention that came into wide use but was not patented. The implications of the first three are that they were patented. The fifth is a real invention, but I was not the first so it could not be patented.
Could you clarify the distinction you make between a real invention and a marginal invention?
That's wholly subjective. A marginal invention, I guess, is what I would say was in the nature of an improvement. Perhaps a substantial improvement but not basic. Whereas a major invention is something I regard as basic and a new idea.
Could you give some examples of each of these categories from your many inventions?
The outstanding example of a major invention that found wide use is my diode automatic volume control, which is universally used in AM receivers and has no hint of obsolescence — what I call a timeless invention. It's difficult to fund other inventions in this category because most of my inventions I do not regard as major. Real inventions, yes, but maybe too specialized to be regarded as major.
The typical case is a real invention that you patented but that didn't find wide use.
Yes. The three categories in this group are first, what I call typical, which is a real invention that may not have been earthshaking. It was patented, but it had little or no use. The second category, which I call the exception, was a real invention that went into wide use but was not patented. We may have only one example there. The most common is the invention that was made during the war for a specific need for the military and immediately went into wide use in its intended application. Not any identifiable wide use beyond the military.
What examples can you give us there?
This is probably the most numerous category because it includes inventions in the improvement category, of which I made many in the 'thirties relating to radio receivers. Individually, it's hard to select some for mention. They were well covered by patents. Typically they were improvements beyond what the manufacturer was willing to afford for marketing.
The third category you have described as a marginal invention that found wide use. What about your diode linear detector?
That was really part of the AVC invention; so it isn't really entitled to separate distinction. I think the stationmaster antenna is the most typical of that category. It was not a major invention but a rather simple solution to a real problem, and it did come into very wide use. It was not patented because the Patent Office refused to understand it.
Can one ask for a different patent examiner?
No, but you can carry it to the Court of Patent Appeals, I believe, is the agency. We didn't do that.
The next category is a major invention that found wide use but was not patented.
The typical example of that was the piston attenuator that is thoroughly described in my Monograph #8. It was an unusual use of a waveguide before the word "waveguide" was invented.
Did you think of it in those terms?
Not in terms of a waveguide, but in terms of a pipe boundary. And that was typical of waveguides.
The fifth category is a real invention but where you were not the first to make the invention, and therefore you don't hold the patent.
Well, the outstanding example of that was neutralization, which I invented and reduced to practice independent of Professor Hazeltine. But he had the earlier patent application.
You've mentioned earlier some of your work with television where it had been done somewhat earlier in England.
One or two of those examples we might call real invention although they were very specific to a problem. So I think they might not be worthy of mention in this brief review.
Also in the category of marginal invention that found wide use you would include a lot of your World War II work?
Yes. The antennas and some accessories that I invented during the war were important but not what I would call major inventions. They immediately went into wide use during the war. The most famous was the so-called "lifesaver" antenna. Another was the strip-line trombone. These were very ingenious and relied on my advanced thinking, but as inventions go they weren't major.
Another example of that category, I take it, would be the Philco-95 design, circuit design.
Well, a design you don't call an invention. That included a couple of minor inventions. We should be mentioning the mine detector. I think I would call that a real invention but not a major invention. It did go into wide use. So it's not clearly any one of these categories.
In something that Alan Hazeltine wrote, he distinguished inventions that resulted from experimental discoveries he gave as examples Armstrong's inventions of regeneration and super-regeneration — and inventions that were made deliberately as the result of theoretical studies. Is this distinction is useful in looking over all of your inventions?
Yes. And I would have very few examples of the ones that resulted from experimental observation. The one I think of first is one type of piston attenuator, which we invented as a result of observations of another type, which ran into difficulties.
I take it these were unexpected experimental results.
Yes, definitely. But by and large my work was derived in some orderly fashion, however much novelty was involved. I've sometimes remarked in talking about my experience that the secret of my success is identifying problems that had simple solutions. Then using or publishing the solutions. Let me try and give one or two examples of that. I'm thinking that some of my theoretical concepts, which became famous are typical of this category. In the 'thirties definitely my most famous publication was the one I called "Paired Echoes," a theoretical treatment of television distortion occurring from circuit properties in non-linear phase or insufficient bandwidth. In this same category is the subject of the skin effect, the idea that I called the "incremental inductance rule" was completely novel in that day and has received much approbation in later years. After the war, my study of small antennas and their limitations was an entirely new viewpoint, and I developed it in a way that led to very simple relationships and rules. The next we might mention is the concept of the radiating element in an infinite array. Once the idea was identified, it was simple. And anyone would say: Why didn't I think of that? That went into wide use in the designing of large-phased arrays.
Perhaps we haven't made clear what strikes me as something exceptional, is how many physical inventions and also how many new concepts or formulas you have made. It of course fits with your approach, which is to make a general investigation of a problem and to try to understand it more generally, and then to apply the principles to solution of particular problems.
I think the ones I've mentioned are the outstanding ones.
I'm interested in engineers that perhaps have influenced your career whom you've come in contact with and were very much impressed with.
One name that belongs in any one of these categories is Professor Terman of Stanford. I learned from him and admired him and looked up to him in all of his activities. First, preparation of his radio-engineering handbook, which came out just before World War II. Secondly, in what I learned about his teaching and his leadership in Stanford University. And third, our extremely close personal friendship because we naturally talked the same language.
You kept in touch with Terman over the years?
From 1935 until his death recently. Another category is the brilliant men with whom I've been associated and whose influence was the result of daily contact and cooperation. Outstanding in that group was Arthur Loughren, whom I brought to Hazeltine in the mid-'thirties. He was already a recognized leader in the radio engineering profession. And we collaborated on some things before the war and during the war. When I employed him, I had already recognized him as one of the brilliant engineers in the profession and one who talked the same language I did. Now in a slightly different category is Daniel Harnett, who was chief engineer of our company until the end of the war. He worked directly with me, and his guidance inspired. Also his leadership in the engineering organizations. He was not individually recognized for inventions and such things but had a great influence on our organization and [was] a great help to me in my development. Now those are the names that involve closest personal contacts.
The next category that I think you would wish me to identify is a few outstanding engineers in our fraternity with whom I was well acquainted and who made a great impression on me from their accomplishments. I guess the first might be the late Bill Everett, the professor at Ohio State and then the University of Illinois. Like Fred Terman he wrote one of the early textbooks on our subject, which I have referred to often in much later years. Another with whom I was less closely — let's say with whom I had less in common in our daily work — was Simon Ramo, but we naturally became good friends from few contacts. And in following his career, I'm always increasingly impressed with his genius and his wide range of talents, from engineering at one end to organization and management at the other end.
Do you recall how you first met him?
Yes. In 1940 the General Electric Company organized a series of lectures on Schenectady's station WGY relating to technical topics. I was invited to deliver one of those lectures on the subject of television. That was in the early days of television development. It is a little remarkable that they selected me from among several who were very active in the field. The host was Dr. Coolidge, the head of the research laboratories. Incidental to my visit I had a tour of the radio laboratory. There I met at the workbench two shiny new engineers. One was John Whinnery, and the other was Simon Ramo. They were working on the high frequency limits of technology in those days. We immediately engaged in spirited conversation, and that led to lifelong friendship. Ramo did not continue as an innovator in technology as much as an innovator in organization and management. Whinnery continued on the engineering and the science avenue and is a prominent professor in the University of California at Berkeley.
Have you had a friendship with Whinnery as well?
Yes. Dating from that first fortunate contact. I see them both now and then in the National Academy of Engineering. Their names were linked in a very excellent textbook on microwaves in the early days.
Are there other engineers you'd care to mention in that category of acquaintances?
Now one of the giants in my mind is Julius Stratton. He wrote the textbook or handbook published about 1940 which brought into electromagnetic field theory many theorems presented in terms of the MKS system of units. This was a breakthrough from the practice in scientific work of two systems of units — one electromagnetic and one electrostatic. In working with them, one was continually confused, and it was impossible to make a universal set of design formulas or performance formulas. Stratton was the first one who brought this system forcefully into the electromagnetics region. I should mention that Professor Harnwell at the University of Pennsylvania published a physics textbook the year before which was perhaps the earlier basic introduction to those units on the part of scientists and engineers.
Did the IRE Standards Committee debate the question of MKS versus CGS units?
I don't doubt it, but I don't have very specific recollections. Everyone who was trying to write design formulas was confronted with that dichotomy and welcomed the advent of the unified system.
That surprises me a bit to hear you say that because my expectation would be that whatever system you learned first, was part of your training, you'd tend to want to continue.
Well, you had to learn both. And I can't really say that one was dominant although the MKS system is basically an electromagnetic system. Mostly there was much confusion, so that typical design formulas were not written in one consistent set of units but the units had to be identified for each formula.
Are there other engineers who impressed you greatly that you had some acquaintance with?
I think there's a quantum jump from these names to the rest of the list. The others are quite numerous. Brilliant engineers, good friends, but not quite in the same category.
In talking about these people you've named, Terman's A Radio Engineering Handbook, Everett's early textbook, Ramo and Whinnery's textbook and Stratton's textbook. Are there other handbooks or textbooks you can think of right now that were extremely important in the fields in which you worked?
Not that stands out.
On the list of engineers that influenced you greatly there was of course Alan Hazeltine.
Yes. He was at the head of the list — and so obvious to me that I omitted to mention it.
You have written a book about him, so a person would not likely overlook that influence.
You probably know that the IEEE is very interested in the question of why there are not more women in engineering and interested in encouraging women to enter the field. Do you have comments on that topic?
Yes. In general terms I've lived a long time, and I've had a lot of contact with boys and girls. And I've been known to say that I found girls brighter than boys. That's an ill-defined comparison, but perhaps significant. In my experience, let's say, before the end of World War II, there were practically no women in creative engineering posts. They had advanced in mathematical operations and chemistry, but not in the electrical engineering. Well, during the war we had on the Hazeltine staff a girl who was educated as a mathematician and had experience in unspectacular positions in the Western Electric Company. Some of the boys called her to my attention as someone whom I should watch. So when I started Wheeler Laboratories, one of the first things we did was to employ Patricia Loth on a par with our engineering staff. She justified that appointment very liberally over her career and stayed in Wheeler Laboratories and Hazeltine until she retired. She did not become particularly famous outside the company, but inside the company she was looked up to. She had real opportunity and a very happy career.

Datensätze: NERC NSP
Summary
A comprehensive interdisciplinary dataset for one annual cycle (NERC NSP (North Sea Project)) was obtained during the period from August 1988 through to October 1989, by repeating the same cruise track in the southern North Sea at monthly intervals (Howarth et al. 1994). The measurements at over 100 locations were made during 15 consecutive months throughout the water column and near the major estuaries. The great variety of observed parameters can be seen from the publications of the results, e.g. Charnock et al. (1994). The data were partly included in the ERSEM, ICES and NOWESP dataset.
The NERC NSP dataset is the only one resolving the annual cycle on a monthly basis with substantial spatial coverage of the central and southern North Sea.
The NERC NSP data products are available as on CD-ROM by the British Oceanographic Data centre (BODC), which can be contacted via the internet

Basashi is raw horse meat that has been popular in Japan and Central Asia for many years. This deep red colored meat is generally served on ice along with certain spices such as soy sauce, shiso leaves, and Japanese radish (daikon). Though the meat is chewy, if prepared well, Basashi recipes taste very delicious. Because horse is domesticated, horse meat is considered taboo in many countries and hence a lot of people do not eat Basashi.
Origin of Basashi
Basashi is believed to have existed since the Paleolithic times, which continued through the middle ages in European countries. Then by 732, there was a Papal ban on consumption of horse meat as this meat was used for Germanic Pagan religious ceremonies in North Europe. However, in the early 20th century, horses were considered for culinary purposes in Central Asia due to shortage of food. Though, not consumed a lot, certain Basashi recipes are considered gourmet.
Preparing Basashi
Basashi is prepared and eaten in many ways, but the most popular way it is enjoyed is by having it raw, sliced and served with a dip mix made of soy sauce, ginger, onions and sake. Other than this, marinated horse meat is also barbecued or grilled, known as ‘baniku’ in Japan. Bagushi is another one of the popular Basashi recipes of Japan, where the meat is skewered on a stick. A lot of people even enjoy the meat as a leaf wrap, where a jagged edged leaf known as ‘shiso’ is used to cook Basashi.
Popular Basashi Recipes
Basashi is not that commonly served; however, it is part of most cuisines across the world such as Japanese, Mexican, Kazakhstan, Argentinian, Mongolian, Australian, etc.
Basashi Trivia
Basashi is quicker to cook than beef, venison, pork, and mutton, as the meat is lean and tender.

Wallace and Gromit: Season 1, Episode 3, Muzzled Review
A more focused and more sinister tone this time around, but some gamers may miss the laughs.
After the somewhat scattered and unfocused last Wallace and Gromit episode, the gang from Telltale are back with a much tighter, more enjoyable adventure, Muzzled. The episode starts with dogs running amok through the town after a recent storm destroyed the animal shelter. Wallace, characteristically, is taking no notice of this as he tries to finish his latest invention, an ice cream truck that can create any flavor. When a passing philanthropist arrives with plans to host a massive Fundraise-a-Fair to build a new animal shelter, Gromit begins to uncover a darker motive behind it all.
It's kind of easy to see where this one is going from the instant the philanthropist arrives. It's even easy to predict several of the beats of the story but there are some twists and turns along the way. The ending, in particular, comes completely out of the blue, but once it starts, it really seems inevitable and perfectly in line with the wacky science and adventure of the Wallace and Gromit franchise.
Perhaps the best thing about this episode is the way that all the puzzles are actually based on the story. From the opening problems with the dogs and the ice cream truck to the final showdown with the villain, the puzzles throughout episode are built around story elements and progress logically from one to the next. In fact, the whole last act requires the player to apply earlier solutions to new problems. It's all very clever and coherent and works to make this one of the more satisfying episodes in Telltale's catalog.
The puzzles are also fairly logical this time around. In several cases, we were able to look a few moves ahead and anticipate the solutions to later puzzles. I could tell pretty much right away where the dogs were and I knew without a doubt not only that I was going to have to break the ride but also how I was going to do it. None of this really detracted from the overall satisfaction of putting the solutions into practice, and there were still a few puzzles that required some leaps of logic.
On the other hand, there's not much overt humor in this episode. While it doesn't detract from the interest of the story and the challenge of the puzzles, there's just not as much to laugh at here as there was in previous episodes. Even the small throwaway jokes are missing here. Sure, there are moments with the Major and with the dogs that are amusing and the movies of Muzzle's life are worth a chuckle, but the real focus is on the tension as Gromit tries to uncover what's going on at the fair.
The goods news is that there's are fewer characters jammed into the same sequences here, which gives them all a bit more room to breathe than in the last episode. The acting on the frightened dog is particularly great. Though it's a one-note kind of character, the animators and directors who were in charge of this character just nailed it. Muzzle isn't quite as interesting as he needs to be given his importance in the story, but the events themselves are often appealing enough to carry you past his thin characterization.
I still feel like the developers are missing out on some of the potential of having Wallace and Gromit interacting with each other a bit more. When they're working together at the beginning and end of the episode, it works really well. But the entire middle act is just Gromit wandering around by himself. He has some good bits with the supporting characters but we still miss Wallace.
As before, the visuals and audio are completely faithful to the animated source material. Wallace's seeming obliviousness and Gromit's weary eye rolls are perfectly captured here, as are their voice performances. The other characters have their moments, but the Major and the twitchy dog steal the show among the secondary characters. The fair is nicely realized with lots of interactive areas and fun animations.
This episode scores big for me in terms of relating all the puzzle elements to one cohesive story rather than simply throwing out arbitrary challenges that are only meant to serve as obstacles. Here the puzzles all mean something within the overall context of the story. The flip side is that this episode is a bit light on humor..

From journal Fredericksburg Va- Americas Most Historic City
by jhearl
Fredericksburg, Virginia
December 14, 2004
There is a self-guided tour that provides a lot of the history and archaeology of the place - not just colonial, but Civil War too. This was the site of an encampment by the northern troops, and the location of one of the pontoon bridges during the Battle of Fredericksburg. You can walk down the old ferry road to visit the site of the pontoon bridge and view Fredericksburg across the river much as the Civil War soldiers and George Washington would have seen it. It's hard to imagine that, in the 1700s, this now placid river was filled with sailing ships bringing in goods from Europe and shipping out tobacco. Standing on the bank, one can try to look through Washington's boyhood eyes and think about the possibility of throwing a rock all the way across as he did (I couldn't!).
There's also a very nice garden here with plants that would have been grown in Washington's time. If you want to learn some things about the boy who became a legend, this is a great place to visit. If you have kids, they can run off a lot of energy here too! There are a couple of short, easy hiking trails, and if you're lucky, quite a lot of wildlife to see (especially birds). There are picnic tables too if you want to bring your lunch.
From journal Ferry Farm

George Washington lived in the Ferry Farm from the age of six to twenty. He inherited Ferry Farm from his father when he was 11. On Christmas Eve of 1740 the "home house" as George Washington would call Ferry Farm burned and his father build a new one. Although he lived most of his formative years in Ferry Farm after his half elder brother Lawrence died George Washington inherited Mount Vernon, then called Little Hunting Creek, and resided there while keeping his mother in charge of Ferry Farm. Finally, after buying his mother a house in Fredericksburg, he sold Ferry Farm in 1774.
Our visit started with visiting the exhibition center situated in visitors center, and then followed by taking a self-guided tour. There was not much to see in the grounds, except couple of closed buildings and excavation sites. While we were visiting there was no excavation, but we were told that there was going to be an excavation that Wednesday. We followed the steps to the Rappahannock River , which also played an important role in Civil War. Artillery of the Union Army was situated at the slopes and a few yards farther was where Union Army built a pontoon bridge in the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Second Battle of Fredericksburg.
When we visited, I guess due to the rains, the river was muddy, people were canoeing in groups and a Ferry was having a cruise on the river. Another story about Washington was that he was able to throw stones to the other side of the river. I challenged my husband to throw a stone to the other side of the river; a challenge many civil war soldiers took upon without success. I learned that the civil war was the cause of demise of the Ferry Farm house. First, it was used as headquarters to the Union Army, later it was dismantled and used as a source of fire.
Admission is $3 for adults, $ 1.50 for kids. We looked for cherry trees hoping there may be offsprings of that very famous tree, but no luck.

Strongest Supplement Ever Tried

This supplement (combined with Lion's Mane and Cordyceps from the same company) is by far the strongest combination of supplements I have ever had the chance to try. Where to begin? It is as strong as prescription medication, only stronger. It has completely eliminated my back pain, knee inflammation, teeth aching, gave me a fresher mouth, and so much energy after just the first dose. Excellent. After sometime of using this supplement, I found out that I have easily doubled my time of swimming with one breath, I could have never imagined that it improves breathing and oxygen utilization to that extent. Amazing.
These really increase my energy

KARRINE TRYING TOO HARD?
Tuesday, November 25th, 2008 at 9:06 am
Views: 3134
Looks like Karrine might be trying a lil too hard to prove that she is the reformed ‘bad girl gone good’ with recent videos I have seen. Here is MEDIA 101 according to Superhead which also verges on a psychology class. So many references to ‘us,’ ‘our,’ and a nice lil PR boost for her Vixen Manuel coming out in 2009 lol. This chick trying to say she changed because she is now 30 as she neither confirms nor denies whether she is having Bow Wow’s baby. Please you still writing your stories, still promoting this life you have left behind yet enjoy cashing in on every now and again. I would have more respect for her if she, like Diddy, stopped trying to make themselves more relevant with this blogging. Camera phones and YouTube have a hell of a lot to answer for.
We pay attention to you Karrine because you put yourself out there, not because we looking for you. If you didn’t put yourself in the firing like like this we wouldn’t be checking for you.

It is often quipped that people from different countries tend to behave differently. That being true in IRC, too. Now, I made up a list of how stupid people can be. The list is incomplete!
Poles are the usual pestilence of the IRCNet world. They usually herd in flocks, and join channels in groups, never alone. After joining, they mutter something in polish that is far beyond anyone's comprehension... and leave. Might it be that they're organizing? They're known to be takeoverers, spammers and advertisers. And idiots.
Germany, being the most populated country of Europe, spread their humanoid monsters widely accross every known network. The users slither on channels and their usual and ask something like "deutsche hier?" ("any germans here?"). That is because most people — stupid germans — assume that germany is the very head of everything, and people speak german everywhere instead of english, whilst the truth is completely different. Either way, they don't care, and speak german.
So, usually they're answered something like "english plz" and they obey — or not. If not, they would be kickbanned and would join from a different host, proving their utter leetness. Spammers, takeoverers, idiots, advertisers... everything. Mostly mindless idiots, though. Remember — only a dead t-dialin.net user is a good one!
*** cretin [foobar@stupid.it] has joined #fools * cretin CIAO A TUTTI!!111!1!!
Seen this, especially in IRCNet? If so, you've been introduced to another type of IRC-idiots: italians. Although not so dangerous like the other types, still, they're annoying. Mostly they join and utter a friendly, yet unwelcome, greeting, in colors. Harmless, yet annoying as hell.

If you’re driving a vehicle equipped with a standard Acura JDM Integra transmission, you’ve tactically connected yourself to the car using a Acura JDM Integra shift knob. The Acura JDM Integra shift knob is moved to assert the driver’s command to switch the transmission, so that different speed levels can be achieved. Though most vehicles nowadays are built with automatic transmissions, both standard and automatic cars contain Acura JDM Integra shift knobs, where the standard ones are moved often, and the automatic ones are hardly touched.
The stock Acura JDM Integra shift knob is often changed out for a custom Acura JDM Integra shift knob so that drivers can inlay their own design taste. Artsy, graphic, simple, classy, and classic type Acura JDM Integra shift knobs are all available, with flashier ones gaining preeminence in recent years. For a personal touch that you just can’t miss when you Acura JDM Integra shift out of park, it’s hard to avoid the draw of aftermarket Acura JDM Integra shift knobs in appealing to drivers who want improved interior design.

Here is a list of common nutrients added to processed foods.
- Beta Carotene
- Iodine
- Tocopherols (Vitamin E)
- Niacinamide
- Riboflavin
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin C
Preservatives or antimicrobials prevent food spoilage from bacteria, molds, fungi and yeast. They also maintain the quality and freshness of a product by extending its shelf life and protecting the natural coloring and flavors. Here is a list of common preservatives added to processed foods.

Different types of additives aide in the processing and preparation of foods in different ways.
Emulsifiers help to evenly distribute the particles of one liquid into another, improving the consistency or texture and the products stability in fluctuating temperatures.
Stabilizers are thickening texturizers that impart body and improve the overall “mouth feel” of a product.
Leavening agents affect the cooking results of baked goods, particularly the texture and volume of the finished product.
pH control agents change or maintain the alkalinity or acidity of a product.
Humectants cause moisture retention.
Maturing and bleaching agents or dough conditioners, accelerate the aging process and improve the quality of the end product.
Anticaking agents prevent the lumping or clumping of powdered or crystalline substances.

E? Written by Rod Crawford <puffinus@u.washington.edu>
This is one of the strangest Charlie Chan films I've even seen, probably because many of the suspects were so weird. That, and the building in which most of the action takes place - with all its secret and motorized panels - is odd to see.
The story: an unpopular family member-scientist, "Dr. Harper," (Frank Reicher) has developed a chemical that makes wood as strong as steel. Our government could use this, especially in time of war, so they are obviously concerned when the scientist is found murdered. They call on Charlie Chan to help solve the case and get the formula. Charlie winds up getting help from his Number Four Son "Eddie," someone I never saw in any other Chan films. He was the bespectacled "intellectual" son in the family and another likable Chan.
Anyway, someone is after the formula - for the money it could bring them - and is culprit is probably from the big family where the doctor was working. All of these people are portrayed as guilty-looking so the audience has a hard time figuring out who's the killer.
The "whodunnit" is wrapped up in the end with a gathering of everyone while Chan explains his discoveries. That was the only problem with the film: the ending was unsatisfying and bit unrealistic.

gunman enters the picture, and things go desperately wrong. Written by Anonymous
`Can I touch it?' asks Barbara Stanwyck's cattle queen, presumably referring to Marshal Barry Sullivan's gun. `It might go off in your face', replies the Marshal. In this brief interchange lies the implicit heart of Sam Fuller's somewhat surreal and operatic western, `Forty Guns'. Fans of more mainstream western movies moseying in from great but chaste works like `My Darling Clementine' or more contemporary cheroot-grinders like `Silverado' will find their expectations seriously challenged.
`Forty Guns' gets your attention immediately with a thunderous opening-credit ride-by. Ms. Stanwyck is astride a pure white stallion leading her Forty `guns' in a column of twos, like a female Custer on her way to a last stand that only she might be able to imagine. As the riders flow, without breaking stride, around a buckboard carrying the three Bonnell brothers, of whom Barry Sullivan's Griff is the eldest, each bro registers the proceedings with a facial expression consistent with his age and experience. It is, perhaps, with the exception of the previously-quoted sequence, the best moment in the film. The dust having settled, much of it on the Bonnells, 164 hooves fading into silence, the brothers repair to a nearby town for a rollicking bath. Thus it begins. Eventually it ends. You may or may not be quite sure what happened in between. But this is not necessarily a bad thing.
In terms of fundamental style, `Forty Guns' is really a 50's TV western jumped up the big board, complete with that genre's trademark, clothes-make-the-hombre ambience. The 50's TV western was a highly stylized form in which anyone having the correct attire could be a cowboy, even Gene Barry, who plays the middle Bonnell brother. Mr. Barry went on to a successful TV career, launched by the series `Bat Masterson', in which his undeniable urbanity percolated up through his character for several seasons, forcing out a Masterson who was rather too smirky, and overburdened by savoir faire. (The real Bat, born in rural Kansas, was a colleague of Wyatt Earp, and cut from the trans-outlaw cloth. He had polish, compared to many contemporaries, but was not a fop). A form as stylized and libidinously constrained as the 50's TV western then falls into the hands of Samuel Fuller, one of Hollywood's most intense and emotional directors; a man who would have shoved a submarine through a soda straw if he had felt the cinematic need. In the case of `Forty Guns', the result is a movie that struggles to proceed, straining in one direction while constantly implying that it would love to go in any number of others, like a big dog on a short leash. But it is this quality that gives the film much of its cult appeal. I'd be hard pressed to call it a good film, although many would. But it is absolutely interesting.
`Forty Guns' should probably not be anyone's first Western (It's really film noir, podnuh). Said person might not ever want to see another. Still, it's worthy of appreciation, if for no other reason than for what it tried to be. Westerns of the 60's and 70's (of which I remain a die-hard fan) often did service by examining sensitive social issues, mainly racism, buffering them with the remove of a century or so. Why not a western that attempts, in its own unusual way, to examine sexuality? Post-feminist womanhood will not be thrilled with the somewhat perfunctory, testosterone-uber-alles ending. But, given the rather startling preceding scene, the ending is entirely consistent with the film's innate strangeness, and its apparent message: love may be over-rated and should probably be avoided whenever possible. I can honestly say that I have never seen anything quite like `Forty Guns', at least under a Stetson, though certainly under a snap-brim fedora. `Johnny Guitar' is in the same angst-arama zone but it's a girl-fight. In `Forty Guns', Barbara Stanwyck, though certainly a presence, is more the May Pole around which the boys gyrate, or on which they hang. The only films I can recall hitting me in quite the same way were some 60's products of the Kuchar Brothers (George and/or Mike). Kuchar films were works of droll, satirical, goofiness that happened to have assumed cinematic form (try keeping a straight face while just reading a list of their titles). `Forty Guns' felt much the same at times but was, apparently, being serious.
`Forty Guns' might stand up quite well to a remake, now that most audiences and studio suits have accepted that sex exists; preserve the stylistic essence of the original but let it be as tumescent as it needs to be. There is actually nothing wrong with the fundamental plot, which I won't reveal so you can project your own understanding. It simply lacks a certain level of on-screen flow. Story elements sort of roil in and out of view in this nearly over-full cauldron. But they're all in the same film, which helps. `Forty Guns' has a slightly messed-with feel to me and may not be entirely what the late Mr. Fuller had in mind. But, unfortunately, we probably won't be seeing a director's cut. The song, `High-riding Lady with a Whip', should certainly be preserved in any remake. It's a piece of music that is as hilariously strange as the rest of the film; one that seems to take itself entirely seriously while making you wonder, `Can this really be happening?'
Don't get off the Sam Fuller train at this outlying station. Fuller's the real deal, an artist who wielded a very distinct brush. Reboard and move on to the `The Steel Helmet', his gritty Korean War drama. If this one works for you, consider hanging out in Fullerville for a while. Anyone who appreciates film should become familiar with his work. And, if you thought the device of looking at one's target through the bore of a gun originated with the James Bond films, `Forty Guns' will set you straight, right down to the lands and grooves.

La Dunaway proves what Pauline Kael said about her in 1981 after the release of "Mommie Dearest" : she would never shake Joan Crawford. She's aching to bring out those wire hangers, and the line readings are pure camp Crawford. However, this gift of a performance will live in infamy, as she portrays a brothel madame in Beverly Hills, with hookers like Donna Dixon and Robin Givens in her stable. Feast your eyes on the most incompetent hookers in film history -- one of them actually gives up drugs and alcohol. While the filmmakers seem to attempt to portray the miserable life of a prostitute, I want to hitchhike to Los Angeles and give it a whirl. This brilliant film is succeeds as a painful reminder of the 1980s fashions we have long since left behind -- I Love the 80s indeed. I have to run now, because I'm going to watch it again. Thank you, Miss Dunaway.

One Britain's great science fiction comedies, "Red Dwarf" is one of the United Kingdom's finest television exports. This is due to the fact that alot of the comedy, through the characters, satirizes British stereotypes (slobs, snobs, neurotics) and makes its own commentary on the bleakness and absurdity that is human life.
The format, which has become considerably more flexible in recent years, started thus. Set in space, some two or hundred years or so in the future, on an enormous mining ship called Red Dwarf, working class slob Dave Lister (Craig Charles) finds himself placed "in stasis"(frozen in time) as punishment for illegally hoarding a cat on board the ship. Awakened by the ship's senile computer Holly (Norman Lovett), Lister is shocked to discover he's been in stasis for three million years and the rest of the crew have been killed by a freak accident.
Asides from the now-senile computer, Lister's only company is a vain, narcissistic lifeform who evolved from his cat (Danny John-Jules) and a hologram of Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie), his bossy and officious superior.
This was the set up for the first two series of Red Dwarf. The format changed in series three when Holly swapped sexes and became Hattie Hayridge, and the crew recruited Kryten (Robert Llewllyn), an eager-to-please mechanoid with an overactive guilt chip. In series six, Red Dwarf and its computer were abandoned, and the crew were forced to survive in modified shuttlecraft Starbug.
Chris Barrie left as Rimmer in series seven and was replaced, courtesy of an alternate universe storyline, by Kochanski (Chloe Annett), the love of Lister's life. The ship, complete with resurrected crew, returned for series eight and saw the adventurers, along with a back-from-the-dead Rimmer, thrown in the ship's brig for their adventures in the previous series.
In the first two series with a minimum main cast, the much-despised grey sets lent an appropriately barren, lonely backdrop to the very character based comedy. Most of this consisted of intimate comic banter between Lister and Rimmer, occasionally livened up by the Cat's hilariously self-obsessed prescence or an off-the-cuff joke from the laconic Holly.
Seasons three to five broadened the scope of the series, making it more experimental with different science fiction concepts. The added prescence of Kryten helped this, his 'groinal socket', susceptibility to the whims of a sometimes deranged Rimmer and increased attempts to break his restrictive programming brought new comic dimensions to the series.
Series six and seven reverse the comedy-science fiction ratio of the series in that the former now takes a back seat to the latter. In other words the comedy of the series accentuates the main science fiction based plots. The comedy emphasis was restored for series eight, although, much like series seven, this element was alot weaker than before.
The series benefitted from alot of strong characterisation. Craig Charles embodies carefree slob Lister, while Chris Barrie turns in a wonderfully uptight performance as the hopelessly neurotic Rimmer. Dancer Danny John Jules brings alot of colourful charm to the Cat, while Norman Lovett is wonderfully sardonic as Holly, whose almost apathetic stupidity allows for alot of comic misunderstandings. After being replaced by Hattie Hayridge for a few seasons, Lovett returned in series seven.
Robert Llewellyn, his entire head covered in a prosthetic mask, has some fine moments in a character that is very much a comic take on the android "Data" from "Star Trek:TNG". Chloe Annett is wonderfully superficial as Kochanski, but is attractive enough to make plausible Lister's attraction to her.
Series eight was helped considerably by the return of Mac MacDonald as Red Dwarf's hapless Captain. During the two-part episode "Pete" he is subjected to a series of increasingly hilarious indignations, prompting a wonderfully humiliated performance from MacDonald.
Time will tell whether or not the series will return, but the series remains one of the definitive comic staples of British television.

Dawn of the Dead
I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.
This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.
And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.
Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.

Guido? Written by <jhailey@hotmail.com>
Giulia is a very intriguing character. So you can see why our main protagonist kinda is tempted by her. While reluctantly at first (it's his offspring that will lead him to the swimming pool), he wants to discover more about that woman. But our main guy has more than the obvious reason to follow her.
As a writer he does have some weird dreams (adding another level to the movie). But it might also be the downfall of the movie. Trying to add as many layers to it as possible, it kinda is overloaded a bit. But all with good intentions of course. And while the main story unravels, there is this other sub-stories that are worth a stand-alone movie too. All in all, not a bad drama, but not great either.

MSNBC host Keith Olbermann was suspended indefinitely Friday after Politico revealed he violated NBC ethics policy by donating money to Democratic candidates in this week's elections.
His suspension is without pay. His donations were the maximum donations permitted - $2400 apiece. Olbermann is a well-recognized face for MSNBC and has "tripled MSNBC's ratings at 8 p.m.," according to Politico. The host of Countdown with Keith Olbermann has been called "the pre-eminent liberal voice on American television" by the New York Times.
The three Democratic candidates who received Olbermann's donations were Arizona representatives Raul Grijalva and Gabrielle Giffords, who both won seats; and Kentucky Senate candidate Jack Conway, who lost to Rand Paul.
NBC News' policy prevents employees from donating or participating in political campaigns or groups as it "may create the appearance of a conflict of interest," Politico noted.
In response to Politico's fact-finding, MSNBC president Phil Griffin is quoted as saying: “I became aware of Keith's political contributions late last night. Mindful of NBC News policy and standards, I have suspended him indefinitely without pay."
Olbermann admitted to the donations, but explained he didn't raise money for any of the candidates:
.
Objective or Partisan?
Yahoo News reported that Olbermann "is a partisan host and expresses opinions on a nightly basis" and "NBC has previously noted differences between what MSNBC hosts and their NBC News colleagues can do." At the Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert rallies last month, NBC News employees were forbidden from participating, but MSNBC hosts were allowed, for example.
However, given Olbermann's suspension, Politico and other news organizations have noted that in 2006 NBC had no problem with its employee Joe Scarborough (also now a Politico columnist) donating money to a 2006 campaign because "Joe hosts an opinion program and is not a news reporter." Talking Points Memo has also found that MSNBC contributor Pat Buchanan donated $2,250 to Republican candidates from 2005-2008, years during which Buchanan worked for MSNBC. Buchanan and Scarborough are both conservative commentators. Neither has been suspended.
MSNBC describes Olbermann's program as a "unique newscast that counts down the day’s top stories with Keith’s particular wit and style," therefore Olbermann's opinion would naturally be included. Is there a double standard? We've written to MSNBC to ask and will update with any response.
Salon offered speculation for why Olbermann was promptly put on suspension.
StinkyJournalism wrote in September when the Center for Responsive Politics reported 235 self-identified journalists contributed to political organizations.
Ethics Cases
The UK Guardian reported the story, noting that "US journalistic ethics are extremely strict, barring media employees from donating to political parties or any other political involvement that might cause a conflict of interest."
But, unlike the UK whose Press Complaints Commission can require print news organizations to deal with ethics complaints and abide by established ethics guidelines, the U.S.'s oft-cited code, the Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics, isn't mandatorily followed by U.S. journalists. Also, the SPJ cannot penalize or hold any journalists (including its members) to the code's principles.
Reporters have been fired and suspended from various news organizations this year as news organizations seek to define the line between providing objective reporting and personal opinions. National Public Radio fired Juan Williams last month after he revealed his personal feelings about seeing Muslims in airports on air at Fox News. Some argued that Williams was fired because NPR couldn't reconcile his dual role as its news analyst and Fox News commentator.
The Washington Post's Dave Weigel resigned in late June after his private e-mails sent to the JournoList were published. In the e-mails, Weigel wrote his opinions about conservatives, the beat he wrote about for the Post.
In July, CNN fired senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs, Octavia Nasr, after she tweeted her respects for the recently deceased Hezbollah leader Sayeed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.
Also in July, four Arkansas reporters were fired from NBC-affiliate KARK-TV because of two video spoofs they made off-the-clock mocking their jobs.
Just this month, two reporters were fired from Alaska CBS-affiliate KTVA after accidentally leaving a recording on a political spokesperson's voicemail. In the recording, they discussed the chance of finding a "child molester" at Senate candidate Joe Miller's rally.
CNN fired Rick Sanchez after he criticized Comedy Central's Jon Stewart and made controversial comments about media figures

Updated: Abril 7, 2004
At a public briefing on Monday, April 23, 2001, the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) Committee on Immunization Safety Review released a report in which they conclude that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorder, commonly known as autism. The Committee concluded that:
Therefore, the Committee recommended maintaining the current policies relating to licensure and administration of the MMR vaccine in the United States. The Committee Chair, Marie C. McCormick, M.D., Sc.D., professor of maternal and child health at the Harvard School of Public Health, stated at the briefing that while no vaccine is 100% safe, the MMR vaccine is ‘as safe as a vaccine can get.’
The Committee reviewed published and unpublished material, and also heard testimony from a variety of witnesses, including Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the author of a well-publicized study published in The Lancet in 1998. This study seemed to indicate that the onset of autism and gastrointestinal problems were associated with the receipt of the MMR vaccine. Dr. McCormick noted that the Wakfield study was published as an observation for further investigation and never claimed to prove the relationship. She further noted that the Committee reviewed numerous studies that examined Wakefield’s hypothesis and were unable to find evidence to support it.
Current research on autism has established that there is a strong genetic component to the disease, however, the Committee report notes that ‘other factors, including infectious, neurologic, metabolic, immunologic, and environmental insults, may play significant roles.’ Therefore, although the Committee felt that a relationship between MMR vaccine and autism would be extremely rare, if it occurred at all, they recommend that research to examine this possible relationship continue.

Zuckerberg: No Facebook app for iPad because it's not mobile
>>IMAGE?
There are 57 comments. Add yours.
Argue whether the iPad is mobile or not all you want, but the iPad needs a Facebook app regardless. Does Safari let me upload photos? No. Do I care about links to applications that don't work on mobile Safari? No. Should I have to tap on account names twice to get to their page? No. Should tagging a user in a post always work? Yes.
I can keep going.
Not mobile.... WoW
Stupid move on facebooks part...
Rene, You're blaming the wrong person. Why doesn't IOS for the IPad allow websites to access photo pikcer. You should be blaming Steve Jobs .. but of course he's your GOD, so you wouldn't.
Steve Jobs gave you a big lecture about how Ipad's are better than Netbooks yet it can't do a simple function like that.
@Jerry
This isn't an Apple lacks functionality debate this time, it's a Facebook being lazy and arguing a point that doesn't exist debate. Netbooks will run native web browsers and file systems, so your argument isn't really fair to begin with. I'm not saying that because I worship steve jobs either, i'm saying that because facebook IS lazy. look at their iPhone updates, they're minimal, buggy, lack features etc.. they always have. that's their scapegoat, and they'll use it as long as they can. Heck, even their internet website has constant vulnerabilities that they have to patch or fix. The iPhone update just released was garbage and minimal. And from what i hear, the android update or app wasn't great either
An iPad is not a netbook, it is not meant to be a netbook (in my opinion, I think netbooks are a waste of time, if an iPad does what you need, get that or a playbook or android tablet - if it doesn't, get an actual laptop, you'll be happier in the long run). But the iPad DOES do what most people want it to do in a smaller form factor. Yes, there are still bridges to gap. For Apple to have 95% of the marketshare for tablets, that's tremendous. But I will agree some functionality needs to be added to make the overall experience better.
Yet another reason why I use Twitter but not Facebook. Zuckerberg obviously just doesn't get it.
@jerry: do you mean "why doesn't Safari on iOS support file uploading?" It already has the ability to copy photos to the device, as well as a website to store images in a local database.
I would love to Safari in iOS to support local storage uploading via HTML's file upload feature, but not for a site to simply access whatever it wants from my camera roll and albums.
Start a team to spam Zuck's wall with complaints and arguments? Haha
Facebook's not mobile - damn it! Does that mean that I can't use it on my mac anymore or my work laptop or desktop. Life's just not worth living any more... MEH!
Not to debate whether iPad is mobile or not, but if they choose to focus on HTML5 for cross platform tablet form factor isn't that better? A more uniform experience across hardware and OS
Sounds like Zuckerberg & Steve Jobs are still at war with facebook & Ping haha
They're trying to work out a way to rip off all your data first before they release a Faceplant App for tablets.
It seems like the people over at Facebook are going to be getting a lot of mail about this... iPad not mobile? Well, I say fooey!!
If the iPad is so great for browsing the web then why do you need an app at all? What's wrong with the full website?
Obviously Zuckerberg is an idiot. They hold a hugely publicized PC in what looks like a high school classroom with an overhead projector. All to announce they are releasing practically nothing. Steve Jobs is probably laughing at FB. What a joke!!
He meant mobile in the sense of smartphone size mobile. He did say he considered the ipad a computer which is what many ipad owners have been trying to say.
But is it even relevant to the whole issue of whether ipad needs an app? No. Even the iphone app bumped up to universal mode would be a start.
ZUckerberg is a tool. I agree with this blog entry - why does everyone else get it yet he doesn't.
Why is mobile such a key anyway - doesn't he want people to use his service? Is it all about check-ins now, or do they actually have other services available via facebook... (remember photos, status updates etc?)
I enjoy facebook but get tired real fast with all the BS on it... now its just political crying and arguing. Having a leader with such lack of vision makes me think I'm spending time on the wrong social service.
Zuckerberg needs to pull his head out of his ass and actually get something out to his customers that works properly. Of course though he doesn't see the Facebook users as his customers, he sees his advertisers as his customers, and those guys aren't that fussed about an iPad app.
Facebook is overloaded with crap, its a different kinda crap than myspace, but its crap nonetheless.
@Joe exactly what I was thinking! Ha
How many people viewed or read the announcements? Judging by some responses, not a lot.
Did Zuck say its not mobile? Yes. Is that what was meant? No. He was specifically speaking on mobile phone platforms today. Was calling it not mobile an error? Perhaps. But, he calls it a "computer" because it wasn't what he was there to talk on today. He said that, killed the topic and carried on. Like any good keynote speaker would when avoiding a question.
As for the setting being a college library lookalike, it was meant to look like that for the setting of the announcement. Why look "homey" when you're talking mobility?
As for whomever stated lack of iPhone functionality and abilities and last to update... Are you kidding me?! Where do you think they test everything first on mobile phone platform? It's sure as hell not BlackBerry. Know how I know? I'm newly reformed from there. There is lack of support and functionality. FB Places is available on iPhone, until today's Android inclusion, exclusively. I get more FB updates, in 2 months, more then I did on BB in 2 years! Don't believe me? Grab a friends BB and try using FB app. You'll be above thankful for what we have!
He does not understand it because he is a 20-year old billionaire .. what he does understand is what makes him a 20-year old billionaire.
Lastly, anyone wanting to mention iOS platform as "mobile", (ie. iPhone AND iPad)... Grab your new Apple TV and go mobile.
FAIL
i don't want an ipad (well unless someone give me one free) i don't have macs just an ipod. i don't evne have an iphone but i'm so sick of these guys getting into these stupid semantic battles and mudslinging pissing contests. it hurts the users and accomplishes nothing. and i'm at starbucks right now and theres a guy with an ipad behind me. so someone thinks it's mobile. by the way i'm typing this on my laptop and it's fricken mobile too.
Billionaire... yes.
Genius... when?? who??
Yes..why do you need an app for facebook when browsing the web is so great on the ipad?? Why not just utilize the actual web site??
@Allyson
Lazy people dont become billionaires. Just sayin'
Or is it the fact that the ipad just doesnt provide a complete web browsing experience? And facebook should create an alternative for apple?
Complain all you want, but he still makes more than all of us combined, and we are using HIS service...
So facebook should spend money developing an app so you can upload pictures and video from a device without a camera? If that is your must-have use case vs the mobile site, then you are the one that doesn't get it.
It seems iPad is behind the curve in some things, and way ahead in others. Facebook needs a iPad app. They are missing out.
The photo upload part of the Facebook site uses Flash, so no photo uploading with Safari on iOS.
This is actually more an iOS limitation then it is a Facebook enforced issue. I can link of at least two other mobile OSes that allow facebook photo and video uploads from the photo and video viewers themselves. You don't need to go to the facebook site or load the facebook app to be able to upload them.
The iPhone app and mobile versions of the website (m.facebook.com and touch.facebook.com) are all missing functionality of the main website. The reason why they exist is because they are designed for the small screen of a cell phone. iPad's screen is big enough to display the full website with no problem. I think that is what Mark said when he meant that iPad is not mobile. To create an iPad app that would support all features of the website would be a huge duplication of effort and it makes perfect sense to me why Facebook refuses to do it. Instead, they should just tweak the full website to work flawlessly on the iPad. Since iPad does not support uploading photos via the browser, there should be a separate iPad app just for that purpose.
Not mobile?? What my 3G iPad is not mobile? Lol this is what happens when you have kids running a business. Good move suckerburg.
Ok I can see all the idiot fanboys are crying and putting the blame on FaceBook when clearly they should ask Apple why Safari isn't a REAL browser.
iPad is NOT mobile. I dont care if you have a 3G version of it. Mobile means a device such as iPhone or Nokia N97 or Droid , where it was built primary as a CELL PHONE unit.
Mobile doesn't mean PORTABLE that can tap into wifi or 3G networks.
If that'd be the case then a PSP , DS , kindle and even the MyFordTouch on a 2011 Ford Edge would all be mobile and should have their own apps.
Get a grip people. Facebook is making a valid point that they're not making a mobile app for iPad. However Im willing to bet that within the next 6 months or so , they will release a tablet version ;)
Back to your geek caves ! :twisted: :lol:
The part I don't get is why any of you actually care. How many of you actually use Facebook? If I hadn't gotten suckered into Farmville, I'd never look at it. It comes nowhere near the scope of Twitter. Even from a Mac or PC on the web it's totally inconsistent. I can look at my pc on the web and my FB app on my iPhone and see two completely different sets of status updates. WTF?!
Time to say "ok, fine, so Facebook won't do an iPad version...let's just call it like it is and stop using FB. Period."
Alli my dear ,
There are more Facebook users out there than iPad & iPhone users combines. Fact.
It could be the other way around where people would say why would I need an iPad.
Let's face it , even tho FB has its minor bugs , it's still a very popular and useful network to keep in touch with friends and family.
Show me one app, website or device that's PERFECT !
;)
My desktop isn't mobile either.
and your desktop doesnt have a FB app.
your point cano!? :roll:
Zuckerberg had to make a deal with the devil to get where he is. I understand that he started Facebook. I understand he's a billionaire. But he has shown multiple times that he is incompetent at running a business. Facebook has been caught multiple times giving away (selling?) users private information. The iPhone app is horrible and riddled with bugs.
The FB app for the iPhone already exists (buggy). Why not make an iPad version? Why not expand your user base even more? Why stare at an opportunity, and not take advantage?
Facebook SUCKS! Never liked it rarely use it. I log on maybe 4 times a year.
People, Facebook is a website! iPad has a 1024X768 screen resolution and is capable of displaying websites without a need to create a special app. The apps are created for mobile phones that have smaller screen. Mark meant that iPad is not a mobile PHONE.
Raphael, good on you mate! Agreed 100% ! :)
@Joe McG
Making an iPad app will cost time and money, and expand Facebook's user base approximately 0%. The intersection of iPad owners, Facebook users, and non-smartphone owners is too small to count, much less any impact on FB's user base. They have stared at that opportunity, and have concluded (thus far) the benefit is not worth the cost.
But, you know, Facebook has a plethora of open APIs. If you see an opportunity Facebook does not, build your own Facebook iPad client, and cash in.
sounds like a flaw in the OS, not in facebook.
this is funny... didn't he, in an interview earlier this year, say that an ipad version was in production? if it wasn't him, SOMEBODY from facebook said it... doesn't matter to me though, the "friendly for facebook" app does the job fairly well
Youre so cool! I dont suppose Ive read something like this before. So good to seek out someone with some authentic ideas on this subject. realy thanks for starting this up. this web site is something that's needed on the web, somebody with a little originality. helpful job for bringing something new to the internet!
What a pathetic excuse. I think it is time for young master zuckerberg to listen to the grownups for once and do as he is told!
Fact is, people like the badge notifications you get on the iPhone. It's exactly the same OS and the iPhone on the iPad, so how can they say it's not mobile? The Facebook website doesn't work on iPad, like it doesn't work on the android tablets too. You are limited with the touchscreen, because of moving things around like setting new display pictures. I agree with the guys above who say Facebook are lazy sons of bitches. Few are Steve Jobs worshippers, we just know that his way is probably best at the moment.
Because he is arrogant.
Bitch
Something to consider is that Facebook is a non-versioned release system...which means if they want to release a new version, it just works.
Having a mobile version-controlled app means that there could be a lot of inconsistency & error messages in the experience for those who haven't upgraded their app since the Facebook un-versioned web experience was updated.
I think we'll see a lot more of this in the future, and Apple will figure out how to make it work in everyone's favor...hopefully.
it works fine with me
Try reinstall, without opening it, change the device family.plist as usual
Then install the tweak then respiring
Nice and helpful info. I will sign up to your blog. Thnx. continue the nice work
hello there and thank you for your info – I have..
Charming idea

Like TeleNav and TiPb on Facebook for a chance to win 30 free one-year AT&T Navigator subscriptions!
Giving!]
There are 128 comments. Add yours.
I think that having this Navigator is going to be great. Being in the Fire and Rescue for the past 10 years, this will give me the better ability to have great directions to be able to get to my location and give my driver better location to where to go. I am looking forward to getting this service wether I get the chance to win or not. Great job by all involved. Thanks
I will be touring grad schools this summer. Would love to have it for that! See! TiPb and TeleNav can help with my college career!
I would love to use it when I go to New York City.
Contests are great, but not quite geek enough for this one
Rarely use facebook so a post about a phone blog Wouldnt be bueno, but Didn't notice option#2(darn reading while driving.)....With this app I wouldn't have to also use maps while driving to Cleveland Ohio from Florida
Going on a trip to Canada!
I would travel to TN with the family. Good times.
I dont have facebook or tweeter account but all the same nothing wrong in trying. Hope i can be picked for a change.
What? No love for Verizon iPhone users? Telenav has an app for that too - which I have... it's better than TomTom, but not as good as a Garmin Nuvi :)
I'll use it to take a road trip across the country!
On a nice long vacation
I like road trips (and both facebook pages). Gimme gimme please. kthanx.
I want to get Telenav to take me away from where I am,,,, anywhere else.
headed to Cali in August! Take me there!!!
How I'm gonna use it is to get me to different job interviews in ares I dont know how to travel through. Since im on the job hunt. It would be priceless to me....
I would see if it would take me geocaching...
Road trip to Sturgis!
I am planning a trip to see Hearst Castle and this would really help me get there!!
I'm planning on using this to help me not get lost.
We spent over 1.5 hours trying to find an iHOP in new jersey.
This thing would of helped :(
Oh well. It would get great use.
Thanks for the great site.
I am currently planning trips from Cincinnati to Florida for the final two Space Shuttle Launches. Then afterward, this summer I am going to be travelling out west to Wyoming and on to Oregon, then south through Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah to do a lot of photography before heading home. I think Telenav would be an excellent addition to my journeys!
I'd love to use it anywhere. I get lost in the closet if the light are off.
Use it on road trips this summer! - best part is it entertains my daughters in the car.
I would love to use TeleNav to help me brave the drive from here to Washington, DC and help me maneuver through that traffic nightmare!
I would love to use telenav to find my way around college, which I'm starting next fall!
Oklahoma State!
Going to NYC!
Thanks Jalan this is really great fbdceaek.re: Maps can you send specifics where it is not updated on your phone but is updated on your PND?re: routing what do you mean by web based web planning and saving routes? I'm assuming that you've tried our online preplanning and My Favorites?re: traffic we've got coverage in most of the major metropolitan areas where our customers live/work and where there tends to be the most traffic. Are there specific cities where you don't feel the coverage is adequate? This fbdceaek is always helpful. Also one of the key differences between our traffic rerouting and most PNDs is that it is specific for your route vs. just providing a traffic summary of the area around you. It's proactive and specific to traffic along your route. Many of our customers see this as a big benefit.re: feature updates this is a valid point and we're always working on ensuring that customers are quickly made aware of new version updates. What version of our service are you currently using? I can make sure you have the latest that is available for that device.Thanks again for all of your fbdceaek on this topic as well as others.
Mike, congratulations! That is the cerorct answer. Please send me (toddw@telenav.com) your phone model, carrier and number and we'll set you up with your one-year subscription.
I'm from small town North Dakota and I go to St. Louis 3 times a year to see in laws and friends, gonna make it soooooooo much easier to get around!!
Just "liked" Telenav. Already have "liked" TiPB for a long time! Going to Maui and would love to have Telenav on board! I'm a GPS addict, but my wife wouldn't go for $10 a month right now.
Boston!
I live in Alaska, Yes, Alaska and when traveling on our rural roads thrhugot out alaska and Canada the roads are rarely marked. You could be in the next town before really knowing if you are heading in the right direction, and most often than not you have taken the wrong road. Not to mention if you go to one of our bigger cities like anchorage or fairbanks where the signage is also horrific you could be going the wrong direction in no time, which makes it all worse when I am in all senses of the phrase directionally & navigtionally challenged!! Then when my 3 little angles realized our long ride to Anchorage or Fairbanks is about to get longer than it already is they just HAVE to mention that mommy is lost AGAIN!! or you should have turned when I said mom! which is my 16 year olds favorite phrase to say after we get back on track.Thanks for the chance to try and get the telenav.DEM
I am moving to Los Angeles soon and I have no idea where I am going!!
I travel a great deal for work in emergency management. Not having to rent a GPS with the car will help!
I need to win because I get utrned around very easily and your app is great. I am planning a trip this summer and this app will help me get where I want to go without getting lost.
I would love for Telenav to take me somewhere far far away from the evil clutches of my Sith boss. I will even take a vacation to the ice planet Hoth! GET ME OUTTA HERE!
Im goona use it to find me some cool geocache locations in ONTARIO!!
I am going to use it to get home because I am so bad with directions!
To the moon
I will use it to take me anywhere and everywhere!!!!
Liked both!! Would use this to drive us all over the SE and Midwest for my husband's cycling races! Great giveaway!
I will use the App to help me navigate the streets of Detroit! and possibly to stalk Eminem! Just Kidding Marshall! :) Buck
I live in Boston and although I've been living here for about three years now, I still get lost whenever and wherever I am! I will use the App to find my way around the city... and not getting lost on my way home!
my son is in a soccer team and we travel from city to city on weekends to play this will be great
I'm traveling to the West Coast...I'm going to LA & Las Vegas in a couple of months & this would really be handy.
THANKS!!
I want to take my wife to the midwest and south to tour Major League Baseball Stadiums - Would love to use app to not only help us navigate and to assist with great places to stay and eat. Love road food.
Use it on a 50th birthday trip to San Antonio.
I will use TeleNav to find my way to ATV trails in Kentucky! ATV trails are a tad bit tricky to find when your traveling in the middle of no where with no where to stop and ask for directions!
Since my wife takes our GPS unit all the time and I'm stuck with Google Maps. This would be FANTASTIC!!
Lost!? Lost is my middle name! I have a road nabrey that no matter how often I drive down it I almost always go the wrong way on it there is never a good time or place to turn around on it so I end up miles and mile out of my way. This is just one example I have many, many stories of being lost. This GPS would be awesome (especially since I have a 15 year old daughter who is following in my footsteps when it comes to directionally challenged.)
I'll be using TeleNav to take the ( then ) wife and I to the airport for our honeymoon :)
I'd be lucky to get a copy of Telenav. Working in production means i spend a tonnof time on the road and a quality GPS app could be a lifesaver taking me all across the cities I travel to!!!
I plan to use Telenav to explore Wisconsin via motorcycle this summer. This would be a great tool.
I would use this app to take me everywhere. I just came from Android to iPhone and I must say that I miss Google Navigator. I actually got lost yesterday haha.
I actually have just received my drivers permit and I need to start learning the roads.. This app would be quite helpful to have. :)
I will also be going to a rural part of Georgia over the summer to see my father and no one knows the way...last time it took us (my family) quite a few hours to find the house out in the middle of no where.
Thank you for allowing me to toss my name in. :)
-Brian
Will be driving from Florida to California next month, I would love to use TeleNav. Thanks!
Driving around everyday just gets me lost in this crazy city...I so need this.
im not trying to sound like a kiss ass or anything but i have difficulty getting around town... i came from the big city of los angeles... and moved out here to the country side of orlando florida a year ago and i have no idea where to get anywhere here.... not used to living out here... definitly couldnt get anywhere with the verizon iphone cuz i would always b hanging up to use the maps app...this is everyday for me because i have to constantly call my friends and have them stay on the line while i use the maps app...(gets very frustrating with really bad turn by turn directions) but this would actually help me alot in getting around the city of orlando.... i would love to use teleNav on my GSM iphone 4...
I have been unemployed for 10 months and I would use AT&T Navigator on my iPhone 4 to find employers I could interview with Nationwide and locally here in dallas to make sure I am never late for my interviews because I would get lost:. This would help me GET THE JOB!!
Thanks
Oh man this would be so awesome for my amazing 180 mile commute :/
I have and love my iPhone, but navigation stinks on it. I have to keep my Droid so I can use Google maps navigation. I travel all over north TX doing pre purchase inspections and have to use nav to get around. I would love to try the telenav navigation.
I plan on using the TeleNav App to help me find my way around Toronto Canada for my wife's friend's wedding. I've never visited Toronto, and want to be able to find all of the great attractions.
Navigation on iPhone sucks. Period. And driving in and out of freeways, interstates and city streets ain't easy with very little guidance. How about showing some love, Telenav+TiPb? :)
Really would love this for appraising new home subdivisions since my Garmin is out of date.
I would use Telenav to drive to visit my parents, my children, and my other relatives - none of whom live within a thousand miles of me.
I agree also, Telenav just doesn't make sense when the rest of the GPS MARKET is not charging you a mlnohty fee. Consider how you also have to have a data plan to also use Telenav and if you don't have any service in your area you'd be screwed. Telenav just needs to get with the program and start offering map packages and charge SEPERATELY for online services like traffic and other things of that nature.Biggest complaint is how this came as the default GPS program for Tmobile HD2 users if they wanna use one what is compatible with NaviPanel. I had to flash my rom to a different version so I could use CoPilot (which I then discovered was TOTAL CRAP ALSO UGH!!!!). So at the moment I'm just living with it. Eventually I'll just go for TomTom or Garmin XT or iGo or NaviGon because as you can see you got way better choices to go for ..
Telenav will take me to Florida, which is 1,120 miles away to see my mom and grandmother!! I am actually going to drive down in the summer. This would help tons!!! I currently live in Delaware!! I'm also driving to georgia in a few months for my family member's Marine core graduation, as well as Virginia to visit other family. Lots of traveling! :) I would be very grateful!!
I love Telenav. I loved it with Sprint, and I love it more as a iPhone app. My travels in Texas are much easier with Telenav.
I would use Telenav on my iPhone to find warmer weather in the southern states. I would have a better handle on traffic delays in Chicago and construction.
I would use TeleNav to go soooo many places. First - I'd use it to find a car dealership to buy a new car. Then I'd take that new car on a trip across the country for me and my new wife. I'd use it to take us to Arizona, where my grandparents lived and are buried - I've never been to their graves. Then perhaps - on to LA to see the stars!
Big fan of TiPb n iPhone. I regularly use gps apps for my travelling, but wished I had a better one than MapQuest or waze.
Would love to have ATT navigator. I can go
places :)
I would use it to make trips back and forth from college in Idaho to visit my family in Mississippi!!
The B. Stands for Burns btw!
Telenav will take me safely to the East Coast on my upcoming vacation!
After receiving the subscription from you guys, i'd use it as my guide to California to visit the Apple Headquarters and possibly see Steve Jobs himself :P in my dreams...
I plan to see if I can really jet ski from Japan to China like Google Maps says. I'll use TeleNav to guide me! :P
I would use TeleNav to take my mother and sister on our first family vacation in years.
I would use TeleNav to replace our old, WAY out of date and bulky TomTom on a trip back home to Washington D.C. I haven't been there since before I joined the Air Force 28 years ago. Now that I'm retired...I have the time to go. Thanks!
I love the app, but I wish it was a tad bit smarter. Couldn't find "Allen Road" from my contacts or manual entry, but it knew "Allen Rd" just fine.
I could use telenav to tale me to Florida next week for a music festival! Telenav would have fun.
I need TeleNav to take me some place warm. Miami would work. This Michigan winter just won't quit.
I've been dying to try out telenav, but I just can't shell out the money for it.
This summer, I'm flying down to Fort Hood with a buddy in the army. He put his car in storage down there before he shipped out to Afghanistan. We're driving the car to Louisiana to see a friend, then driving it back up to Maryland. It'll be my first huge road trip, and I'm kinda dreading it. A quality GPS unit would make all the difference!
I will use this to travel this summer as I am a photographer and it will help me get to some of the harder places to find to photograph.
I'll let it take me anywhere as long as it doesnt direct me into a lake!
I will use it for traveling with the family, fishing trips, and work!
My Garmin just bit the dust. I'd use TeleNav as a replacement while traveling for business.
I would use it mostly around town, but I have a long road trip from Chicago to Sarasota in June that I would love to use it on.
Thanks!
Need it mostly for my kids! They have absolutely NO sense of direction!
ROAD TRIP!!!! this will help with not getting lost on road trips!!! and finding gas stations before we have no gas on said road trips.
I plan on using Telenav to get me around town. I am in college and am trying to learn the roads so having something like TeleNav would be amazing. I have tried the free trial and it was amazing but I just couldn't afford it. I used it to get home over Christmas break and even when I made a wrong turn it quickly corrected the route and got me back on my way. I also used it in a recent trip to Disney, so basically it would be used to keep me from getting lost while I adjust to a new city.
I've "liked" TiPb on facebook for a long time already! If I won, I'd use it to guide me to my friend's house in New Mexico. My friend has been sick for a long time, and I haven't been able to get down theor to visit him.
I would love to have this I am a traveling salesman and don't really like the navigon app for driving. And this would give me a solid chance to try this service out after already spending 50 bucks on nav apps that just don't do what I need them to do.
Team Jailbreak

We are going to Maui. This would be great.
I'll use telenav to find Waldo.
I would use Telenav to get to almost anyplace in this big city of Dallas. I've lived here for 8 years and still get lost.
My wife and I are taking a couple of trips this summer, one to the Smokies, and one to the Cascades. I intend to use Telenav for these!
I'll use it to help me get to Origins this year in Ohio.
I'm going to use Telenav to navigate through Southern California...it's where I live and despite living here my entire life I still get lost :)
I am a truck driver and I would use the Navagation from AT&T for locating my pick up and drop off spots. Telenav and AT&T are both excellent companies, together they will have the best navigation service there is!
Moving to San Diego soon, and will need to know how to find my way around town.
I'm going to use it to help me get to my family vacation hotel in Siesta Key, Fl
I will use TeleNav to shuttle my son to his many soccer games this summer. I love the TeleNav web interface!
i do a lot of biking and this would come in handy. i also, tour with my band and we all have bad senses of direction!!!
in fact, i just got lost while typing this message.
I'm going to use telenav to help me relocate to a new state for my first job after I graduate college next month!
I am going to use TeleNav while traveling across the US with my family! Can't wait to get going and can't wait to win!!
I would use it for my vacation to fl in June. Taking new son to Disney!
Road Trip with kids! Last year we drove from Baltimore to Tallahassee and Sarasota FL for spring break. This year we plan to go north! Better navigation would be awesome!
After having driven 3,000 miles across the US getting here safely thanks to my Sprint Android phone using Google Nav and Sprint Navigation(Telenav) I switched to AT&T and the iPhone, now I find myself lacking any decent navigation, 3,000 miles from home in a place I don't understand =[
I would use telenav to get me to Deal's Gap. I ride a motorcycle and every year I take leave from my job in the military and travel to some of the best riding in the country. My iphone is my music player and telenav would turn it into my GPS as well. Two years ago I had a crappy Samsung that had the ATT navigator free. It was awesome to be able to use the app to go on the trip but not worth staying on the Samsung. Now that I have the best phone out there, I'd use the telenav app to get where I need to go.
I would use Telnav to find new places to photograph!
I'm about 30 minutes south of Los Angeles in Long Beach. Having TeleNav would give me another good reason to explore L.A.
I would use TeleNav to take me somewhere warmer that I could relax! Thanks for the great promotion and the great reading here at TiPb. You all rock.
I'm gonna use it to go to Disney Land this fall with my fam. Also heading up to MI for a wedding and NC to see some friends!
Drive to California...
I would use TeleNav to help me navigate through this crazy Atlanta traffic. HELP! Thanks TIPB!
I would use it when I am stuck in traffic and need an alternate route. Also when I am traveling to see family.
I would use TeleNav to take me to across the country on my dream trip to Disneyland!
i would use telenav when i drive to MA from NY this summer!
I would use it to show my Android friends how lame their GPS is.
Maybe we could find our way around Baltimore/DC in July when we visit our daughter at Ft Meade
i'm gonna drive to the keys, please guide my way!
I'm retired now, so I've got plenty of time to drive all over. I don't want to get lost!
I would really love to use TeleNav to take me to all 30 MLB ballparks this summer!
I'll use telenav to get to my friends graduation. I'm in California and he's graduating at the airforce academy I. Colorado. Road trip!
I would drive to see each of my family members across the country this summer, which would be great! Maryland, Florida, Ohio, Nevada, and Georgia! Winning this would make it much easier!
I just got an email stating that I won! Yay!
I won too @nicole
Telenav will take me to little grass valley reservoir, CA
HAH! What a fun contest Christina Anyways, just like enreyove before me, I'd love this why!?Hubby has a GPS in his cell phone and it's the best thing Ever! And, I don't get to use it nearly enough; if I'm lucky a couple times a month. Usually during errands on the weekend, when I don't need it at all. But, just to feel good we let us talk our way around town.As a not-at-home-school family we're going to parks, museums, coops, field trips on a daily basis throughout the state with new destinations every other day or so. IF I had this on my cellphone I wouldn't get lost the average 3-4 times a week, stuck in traffic for hours, or waste anymore precious gas. My littlest one just said Mama, you get lost many times every single day Today, we tried to go to an amusement park and I had google maps printed out; but that did NOT work, because just like noted above they're not always wrong. In my experience, I've banned mapquest about 3 years ago, because they were notoriously wrong. Also, as forgetful as I am I always fail to map out and print return directions. Believe me, I've lost much gas, sanity and time, simply because the return trip due to multiple highway exits/entrances, one-way streets, and multiple-lanes-that-I-can't-turn-because-I-didn't-see-the-street-coming-and-I'm-in-the-wrong-lane roads always get me off track.I'm always driving in circles. I've even mastered the quickest, hopefully safest, K-turn on the tightest roads and U-turns on the big ones. As for traffic jams: 7 miles from New Haven, we have the states worse highway bottleneck which can clog up traffic for hours for a 5-15 min. drive. When we took separate cars: Daddy, 1 daughter and me in one; Hubby & 2 other daughters in another, we were coming home from Newport, RI which should've been a 1.5 hour drive; took use close to 3.5 hours, but hubby got to navigate his detour and was home in less than 2 hours. We obviously lost him, and missed his exit; but even when he called by cell; we couldn't guarantee we'd know how to get home.In New Haven and NYC (which we visit ~ 2 times a month), we need detours for traffic jams and alternative routes to find parking. One convenient time, we parked and had the GPS lead our way by foot to the museum and restaurant of choice. Oh what I would do to have this luxury every single day. Add the fact that I have a bad memory and always seem to recall the wrong landmarks I can never stray off one-set of directions. So, a detour is my worse enemy. Especially because the signs never seem to get me to where I needed to go. We had so much road construction in New Haven this summer, and 3 of my girls' camps were in the center of the city oh, how I dreaded those days!Last, we leave SO much earlier than necessary to compensate for my driving, just to make things on time. For all the reasons above, we didn't have the best reputation for being on time much, even allotting what I thought more than enough time in the first place.Geez my 9 yo is reading over my shoulder and sighing Mama you can write forever about this topic . So, I might as well stop now. If I don't win, just seeing how much time, energy, gas money I wasted these past 3 months it may be an investment I have to make hopefully not Fortunately, my girls have mastered car games, and can read and write incredibly-neat in a car well, as you can see we're in it ALL the time

Share awesome new iPad Retina wallpapers -- every day!
Cases in this case -- needs to be rotatable). Sure, Apple provides a lot of really high quality, really beautiful looking wallpapers built right in, but for some of us, there are never enough.
Apple's also tend to focus on nature and texture, which is great (the new ones released in iOS 5 are all water-themed). But some people prefer more tech-styled, electronic wallpapers. Some prefer photos of family or friends, or favorite movies, TV shows, or musicians. Some even like their iPad wallpapers a little more naughty than nice (hey, we're not here to judge!)!)

The maps is a cool new feature. Everything elsr is ok. I would like the native msgn app to be changed. There should be a quick reply pop up option like bitesms.
I hope you realize that Apple's new Maps app is actually LESS functional than the new version of Google's app that was demonstrated on an iPad last week!
You can say goodbye to public transportation routes, bike routes, pedestrian routes, OFFLINE MAPS, street view, and GLOBAL COVERAGE!
You just better pray that Apple approves Google's new Maps app, or you're screwed...
be nice if it was in the store but honestly, i've never had occasion to use any of the things you mention. so not a loss really.
Do you know how many people actually use all of those features? Most people use maps to get driving directions. Usually only cities like New York have large amounts of people that use bike/walking directions. The new app actually dows have pedestrian dorections. Street view is cool but not necessary. And global coverage will affect a lot of people (outside the US) but from my understanding, the only thing they don't get would be turn by turn (voice) directions.
Apple's app is definitely missing features, but all (at least most) of the really important ones are there. And they will definitely be adding back certain features over time.
My point is that we're not 'screwed'
Actually people in every major city in the world rely on public transit, biking directions. That's...I don't know...maybe a lot of people? I can say in Chicago, Google Maps public transit directions are invaluable, and I used them every day. Not everyone drives a car, which doesn't make sense in the city. Again...I'd say that's a LOT of people who are screwed.
And Street view has more practical value than "Flyover 3D Mode" or whatever it's called.
I agree. I'm in Milwaukee and to go downtown you really don't want to drive. Plus people with disabilitys don't drive so public transpertation is very valuable. People are doing more walking today, it's healthier and a lot better for our envirorment.
More importantly, Google maps is not going away. It will not be the stock map service on ios but is will remain available as an app and as a web service.
Not sure if you live in a major city but I used this feature all the time in Charlotte as well as manhattan
I can answer your question: John lives in a parallel universe (Earth-2?) where cities have been deserted and everybody lives out in the boonies. This is all happened after the zombie apocalypse.
Actually apple is in trouble because if these new maps are not as accurate as google maps a lot of people will switch to other platform. And unfortunately they are not accurate at this moment. I mean other countries as there are many others besides The USA
Good luck with that story.
RUMADBRO?!
I can’t believe it but I’ve found myself looking at android phones since this announcement… I am a big apple fan and have always defended iOS against the haters, always agreed with the gradual update policy rather than complete re-design and have accepted some of the short comings because it all ‘just works’. But I think Android with ICS is getting pretty good now as are some of the top end handsets. I wasn’t overly impressed with the iphone 4s (it’s the first iphone I decided not to get), the new ipad also didn’t wow me enough to upgrade my older ipad and now with this iOS release, are apple slipping or am I just too picky?? Maybe I need to take a punt at Android, if its bad then I’ll be back and I’ll appreciate my i-devices again so much more!
You'll be back :)
Trust me I tried it ;)
I guess I just don't need to upgrade OS and hardware every year. I upgraded from the 2010 MBA to the 2011 MBA mainly for the lighted keyboard and it was worth it. I upgraded from the iPad 1 to the iPad 2 for the speed increase and again it was worth it. But really, software updates have not been enough to upgrade for yet. I'd need to see videos included in Photo Stream before moving up the software.
This is basically a list of things that Android has had for months/ years. Make sure to check out a top of the range droid on the latest OS and you will see its years ahead of Apple.
You'll be back. I also own a HTC One X (probably the best Android phone...except the s3 that will be available this year). I went back to my iPhone like that. "Android did it" gets really old because yes, they did it. However getting a high end "droid" doesn't feel like I'm light years ahead...it feels like I'm beta testing. The only difference now between iOS and Android is this: Google pushes out features as soon as they can. You deal with the bugs and whine to google to fix them. Apple polishes and polishes until it's shiny.
You can try the switch. You'll find yourself coming back though...especially if you own more than one Apple product.
I just came back from trying to switch to android. The thing that bugged me most was the storage space for apps, even switching apps to my SD card i kept finding i'd run out or get that annoying message saying it was low, Android still has a way to go before it's as smooth as the iPhone. spoofs it on internal. drive with hotlinks ...
On gingerbread the protocol was updated to move2sd+ which works in a similar way...
If you just switched its a shame both options have been around for a year, even if you have a very old phone ...
..( the original move2sd did suck! and Google should have anticipate this problem and come out in front of it rather than having users like yourself. Get lost when there was s simple effective fix... Or maybe you should have gone to a developer forum ( like xda )or just Google and did a search.....
With all the hackers on an open platform ;didn't it occur to you that it was solved ? spoons it on internal. drive with hotlinks
Apple must be polishing a turd then because I've yet to see it shine that well in my use of iOS...
"However getting a high end "droid" doesn't feel like I'm light years ahead...it feels like I'm beta testing.
That's actually pretty well-phrased. I'm a long-term Android user and vastly prefer it to iOS, but Android does have kind of an experimental, "hey, let's see if this works" feel to it. That might actually be part of the draw for me, actually.
I'm definitely an Apple fan for the simple reason that the IPhone, IPad and IPod Touch are blind accessible right out of the box since they include the VoiceOver screen reader. There are similar options for Android devices admittedly, but while a few of them are even free none of them are included out of the box and quite frankly I wasn't impressed with them when I tried them. One in particular kept telling me I had new voicemail and text messages every five seconds when I quite clearly had none. So far I've never had those or indeed any issues with either of my IDevices. I own an IPod Touch and an IPhone, which some might consider overkill since it means that in a way I have two IPods. But I got the Touch before the IPhone since I figured it would be a good way to ease myself into learning the IOS interface without having to worry about the possibility of accidentally rejecting calls or something in the first few weeks. Of course looking back now i realize that might have been an absurd worry considering the way the IOS interface works with Voice Over.
Ya know, I agree. I started with android and I had 3 different droids eventually leading to my iPhone when it was released on verizon. I've been very happy with my phone but I cant help oogling over how much fun it is to play with an android and how much they have improved since I had it a year and a half ago! When iOS 6 was released, I was let down because almost everything released, I had on my crappy droid eris over 2 years ago. As a tech junkie, I need development and I feel like apple is really slowing down on that process.
The things that keep me from switching:
1. My mom, sister, 2 best friends and gf all have iPhones (plus a few more close friends)
2. The iPhone just works. Androids tend to slow down or get a little buggy. iPhone just keeps on ticking (personal opinion)
3. iTunes backs EVERYTHING up. Android backs up some things. If you do a master reset, youll have lots of fun trying to get it all back the way you had it.
4. With iOS, I dont have to worry about having too many apps open and slowing down the memory.
5. Androids make me phone hungry and i tend to upgrade between 2 and 4 times a year (I have 5 lines on my account)
Time to Jailbreak. You'll love it, trust me.
Wait, the good days arent over, 4S was an incremental upgrade and wait until the end of the year for 5. iOS will get better. There are major UI changes in iOS 6 that Apple didn't show off.
Sure..
If iPhone 5 is like the leaks. 4" screen by going 16:9 and not wider. Box shaped case. It will not impress, just 4" to say 4" not really larger. Almost the same shape except taller.
I would have gone for the Rumored iPhone 5 from last year, it was much better looking and shaped. This years rumored device is not exciting.
Hope to see something better, I'm due for an update and skipped 4S.
it will be LTE and that alone will make it sell. And most people are like imore readers that need the new look at me toy and want change because they are bored.
Yeah, like what?
Yeah I thought like that to last year. And went through two months of hell. Had three different phones that were horrible. Both hardware and most of all software. and support from google was... o wait they had little to no support what so ever. But hey to each his own.
Believe-me even with ICS and nice phone Android just don't work as well as iOS. I tried and with exception of maps, customization and multitasking experience everything else is better on iOS. I think that you will be back. Wait iPhone 5 if you can. They may surprise with nice hardware enhancements.
But, Aldo, what does that tell you about the Apple devices that you have now: the iPhone and iPad? After a year or more of use, they are still doing the job you need and you saw no need to replace them. That speaks volumes about the quality of what you have. As for other platforms, I've found that "cool" on the surface (no pun intended) doesn't necessarily mean useful and reliable on the inside. In any case, all the best to you!
Am I the only one overjoyed with iTunes Match now streaming rather than just downloading!!! This is a massive improvement.
I wish they would have announced that they were upping the 25,000 song limit for iTunes Match. Can't sign up. 48K+ songs in my library.
Where's the RIAA when you need them?
25k song limit for a paid service whose only advantage is that you do not have to upload songs if they already exist on the server? And you can only use via ios or iTunes? I'll take google music or amazon cloud.
i agree. already uploaded 18k songs, still barely use it but it's free. not monthly charges and considering how little i use it that's a big plus.
How the hell do you spend 48 thousand dollars on music?
The reason why this doesn't look like much is that Apple wasted tons of time and staff recreating google maps. As soon as the map rumors started swirling, it was cleat that if they were true, the resources Apple would need to put into it would be overwhelming, which means less for everything else. The new maps has pretty eyecandy to mask that it is missing usuability features of the current maps app. Everything else is little incremental things: siri searches for more things, tweaks to the maps app, etc. Ho hum.
if he bought them he most likely wouldn't be trying to "itunes match" them...
don't need to buy them all off itunes. I've got maybe half that amount but my large collection is mostly my collection combined with my father's huge collection all ripped before iphones existed. I actually started ripping my stuff like many people before anyone was selling hard drive players. i was playing them off my computer in my apartment. Then an ipod was just a hope.
He's clearly saying he has 48k FILES in his library... not that he spent $48k ON those files.
I just want you to be aware that it's a 25,000 uploaded song limit. Matched songs don't count. I'm sure you'll be fine.
A few questions came to me while reading...if you could please gives more details on them...
Custom vibrations for alerts - what do you call "alerts" exactly? Clock alarms, countdown, reminders, etc?
International language and local search (Canada, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Korean, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China) - Does the local search mean that services like map & directions, businesses, restaurante, etc is now available in all these countries? This Siri features were not accesible with iOS 5.
And an estra question. I haven't read this one in your article at all, but elsewhere, maybe someone could clarify this. Is there a way in iOS 6 to set custom ringtones to specific apps? (OS- based, and no like Whatsapp, which lets you choose between their app's sounds).
Thank you to evyone for any help.
I appreciate this update more probably because I left my 4S and went Windows Phone 7 but came right back to ios. Don't get me wrong, WP7 is a great OS but it is not for me. Their deep integration, live tiles and navigation are fantastic. But it is still a new OS , thus making it vunarable to bugs and annoyances over time.
Same went for iOS pre 3.2 hence always jail breaking. iOS has now matured into a Solid mobile platform where these additional features are just a fine refinement of the existing platform and a beatiful harmony of hardware and software, something Android has failed to achieve to this date. Don't get me wrong, the HTC One X is by far the best Android device to date, yes still better than the Galaxy III, but that's for another day.
I feel shafted with no lube over the fact the turn by turn won't be available on the iPhone 4. Also a few other features won't be available either. To say I'm p#ssed off is an understatement. Though I'm not forced to update my phone it won't being long. I have no job and can't afford a £37 pound a month contract. Nor can I afford to pay over £400 for a new phone. Apple is starting to p#ss me off.
Apple are a business. Why would they not want to sell new products? Times are hard, sure, but if you don't have a job and therefore can't afford a new iPhone then that's that. No point moaning about Apple wanting to make money. You haven't got turn-by-turn at the moment and you haven't got the other features you say won't be supported on the iPhone 4 so it's not like you got the phone for those features. I'd quite like the newer bigger, more powerful, more feature-loaded car that my current car manufacturer has just brought out. But I can't afford it. I'm not going to start being p#ssed at that manufacturer for doing that though.
Typical conservative response. There iPhone 4 can definitely handle the upgrade but Apple chose to not include it out of greed. There are other reasons to upgrade to an iPhone 5 other trying to cripple the iPhone 4 to do it. Not everything a business does solely for profit is a good idea. One of these days you guys will see that.
He's saying that the guy got what he paid for and shouldn't expect a lifetime of free features just because he wants them. The purpose of a business is to make money not give handouts. If they put all the new features on all of the old devices everyone would buy cheaper older devices or not upgrade at all. Which equals them losing money.
"Typical conservative response"? Such a rediculous attitude toward a simply logical statement. Don't by what you can't afford and eventually those that sale it will make it affordable, in order to bring it back into demand. Wow, there's and interesting concept!!!
You can have very useable turn by turn on an iPhone4 - there are apps for that. Loads of 'em.
As a fellow iPhone 4 user, I get where you are coming from. But I always go back to "It didn't have it when I bought it"
Not to mention the biggest factor -- The iPhone 4 will be the "free" phone come iOS launch.
iOS 6 to support iPhone 3GS and up
If you want Maps with free turn-by-turn directions, you could always just pick up any 4-year old Android phone; since, you know, they've had it all along.... :P
One of the most important reason why people are pissed because iPhone 4 didn't get the turn-by-turn is that it's not much of a difference between iPhone 4 and 4s. It's the same phone with siri and better camera. Not a reason to upgrade for most people.
The performance of the CPU & GPU of the A5 processor in the iPhone 4S compared to the A4 in the iPhone is quite significant. Nevermind the fact that the antenna system on the iP4S is improved upon compared to the iP4. So no, the iPhone 4S is not just an iPhone 4 with Siri and a better camera.
...and if you genuinely believe that the "VAST PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE" between the 4s and the 4 is what is required to support something as resource hungry as "turn by turn navigation", well, you're an idiot.
A very simple improvement would be allowing us to add custom words to the dictionary. I'm sick of writing friends names and auto-correct kicking in and I have to type it three times etc.
If I not mistaking your comment, you can add custom words in the keyboard section under settings. I have a ton of them that I use not only for names but shortcuts too.
And the custom words now sync via iCloud. Very nice feature!
I'm thrilled with the 'Do Not Disturb' feature! It's actually a suggestion I (among, I'm sure, many, many others) had sent to Apple. Since we no longer have a home phone, I hate turning my phone off at night, or if I take a nap during the day. Now I won't have to!
I always figured that's what the off button was for. I guess that I know now though eh.
The problem with the Off button is that it also stops emergency phone calls...my parents are in their 70's, I can't afford to miss a call from them or my brother...so...no off button for me, ever.
I may never read this forum again, but I have to say... Epic egg on face moment for Anthony, there
Cant agree more with @Aldo. With great success with iDevices, Apple is one.. no, 3 steps behind competitors and just watching and start copying them. They dont want revolution now. What a shame!
Hardware-software optimization? Yes, it worked before but these days competitors like Samsung getting knows how to optimize their better hardware (than apple) with Android. And as long as I know, Samsung and Google are making their own operating system and device like Apple, Apple will gradually lose their position. In my opinion in 5 years, Samsung and Google will take the popularity which now Apple have.
Come on Apple, I really loved you guys. Please dont be settled down.
What are talking about? Please be specific. What hardware optimization are you talking about? In what way are they "3 steps behind"?
Apple always late to add very BASIC and ESSENTIAL features to iOS which their competitors have them long time ago. Such as folder system, multitasking (even it is not true multitasking), notification center and so on. They sit back and watch what Android do first and if it looks great they implement to iOS. They are sayng it is because they want to make it perfect and stable but that cant be an excuse. I am for sure sometime later Apple will add "widget" and "quick-access button" (for the WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and etc) on the notification center which Android had from long time ago and they will say "wow it just works", oh also they will escape from SMALL 3.7 inch screen to follow competitors. Apple lost how to innovate, they are so afraid to do revolutionary thngs. I bought all generations of iPhones, iPads, Macbook Pros bucause Apple was so creative and revolutionary which make me to feel pleasant when using them. It is time to think again how they approach when they make iOS or iDevices.
So changing the screen size because their customers want it makes them copy android?
of all the other things he mentioned, you selectively picked the screen-size.
Attach a photo to an email, every mobile device can do it except for iOS5, iOS6 will have it and they think it is the best in the world.
having signature for each email account, WP7 has this, it's like they polished it and it is so shiny that you will be blinded just by looking at it.
that's what the guy is saying.
love the ios 6 but only thing is no maps loves for iphone4 this just absurd for me but ı wait for publıc release but ı am realy upset for maps for iphone4 because ı am ok with no siri for but maps we waith for this...
iPhone4 will get maps - just not turn-by-turn - no biggie - there are apps for that.
the hell do consumer gotta pay for an app when the iphone4 handle the processing? are you that retarded? there's an app for everything that iOS6 do, if that's the case, apple doesn't need to lift a finger.
the 4s isnt light speed ahead of the 4.
No, I'm not intellectually challenged at all. I'd question your thinking abilities after reading your reply... there are free turn by turn nav apps out there. If you'd bothered to look, you might find one you like. But that would preclude you from incessant whining that you're not getting something you could have had all along had you bothered to take the time to find it. smh.
I'll admit that I wasn't overly impressed with everything shown. It would be a great 5.X release but not sure it's enough to be a full X.0 release. That's really all they were able to come up with in a whole year???
What actually does make me upset is the features that were selectively made unavailable on the older hardware. For example, no FaceTime over cellular for iPhone 4... really? I plan on getting the new iPhone in the fall anyway, but there is no technical reason why that wouldn't work on a 4. It's stuff like that that makes me shake my head. Not everyone can afford to upgrade.
I can understand being disappointed that some cool features in iOS 6 won't be functional for iPhone 4, iPad 1 and older devices. I can't understand being angry or upset or p#ssed, as one poster above put it. In some cases, there are definitely technical reasons why a particular feature doesn't work (e.g., the iPad 1 only having 256mb available to the OS is a big limitation now.) In other cases, the features give a competitive advantage for newer Apple devices over the latest Android devices and even over older Apple devices. The iPhone 4 will soon be 2 generations behind. The iPad 1 already is. The iPhone 3GS is 3 generations behind. It isn't reasonable to expect every feature of iOS 6 to be made available on older hardware, especially when Apple wants customers to have reasons to upgrade. At least iPhone 4 users CAN upgrade to most of iOS 6. Most of the Android phones that are less than a year old STILL don't have ICS, and many of those never will. How's that for fair?
"It would be a great 5.X release but not sure it's enough to be a full X.0 release."
This, I agree with.
Perhpas this is all a clever scheme in order to wow us with the "New iPhone" in October. I can't help but think that we will see major updates then.
These are major updates..
No offence, other than Maps, what's so major about this release?
SERIOUSLY WHEN ARE THEY GONNA ADD LOCAL SEARCH IN THE ENGLAND!?!?!?!?!?
You mean like they just have?
I'm not exactly sure, but does the new iPhone support LTE?
Sorry I'm a new b lol
Thanks
Hopefully it will. And hopefully we'll get a bigger screen as well but, we'll just have to wait until fall to see for sure. Because you know apple...always changing things last second haha
i think verizon and At&T said that no more smartphones will be released without LTE and with sprint paying to expand to LTE i don't see how it can't.
Hopefully the new iPhone is more than a stretched iPhone 4 otherwise it will be a huge disappointment
Downloading from App Store doesn't kick you out anymore and you also don't have to keep entering your password for app updates... This is really nice!
You didn't have to keep entering your password for app updates before, there's an option in settings where you can choose how often you have to enter your password :)
@Esme where exactly is it in the settings? im kind of new to this haha
I'm curious where that option is hiding.
That option is for the password to lock your phone, not apple ID password
I just wish they hadn't screwed the pooch so bad on the maps.... the only way I'm upgrading and not migrating to Android as soon as my contract is up, is if Google releases a GOOD (not web wrapper) app of Maps and it's actually approved, which I can't see Apple allowing.
I am a non-Japanese person living in Japan and I live and DIE by those maps being comprehensive and in English, and the data sources disclosed so far are horrid and lacking in a single English version of the Japanese names.
So much this! I'm the same, here in Japan. The iPhone 3G was my first phone ever and I got it for exactly 2 reasons: browsing the net and google maps. I will either not bother updating to iOS 6 or I may be forced to jump ship. I also love street view and use it all the time to find businesses since the streets here are so chaotic. I can't imagine not having google maps on my phone. 3D flyovers or 3D views entirely are of no interest. Love the satellite views and public transportation routes. I guess I'll have to wait and see. I was really looking forward to upgrading from my current iPhone4 too this fall but now...
Looks like Apple needs to step up their game. I have just moved to iPhone 4S from Android, and although IOS "just works", it lacks a lot of basic features that are native to Android. The new ICS on Android puts to rest any past complaints about lag and instability on Android devices, and people must be buying into it, as the new Samsung Galaxy SIII will be the best selling phone at launch of all time. I would really like to stay with iPhone, and believe me I am not bashing, but IOS6 is just a minor update, and seems to put Apple further behind. I have read the forums on this site for a long time, and since IOS was announced it seems as though a LOT of people are considering a switch to Android. If they go with one of the new ICS phones, this may not be a bad idea.
To say this is a SMALL update is a bit of an exaggeration. this update was obviously to more closely integrate Mac OSX with iOS. A feat that has yet to be done by any other cell phone maker. All part of the close nit system that Apple has in place. If you have a windows computer and no other apple devices, yes this is a SMALL update. If your rockin a mac and other apple tech, this is a HUGE update. I am looking forward to many of these smaller features to more closely integrate my Mac with my iPhone with my iPad with My apple TV.
A clock app for the iPad. It's the little things that make me happy...
I noticed Bluetooth settings now quicker to get to... If only I could ask Siri to turn Bluetooth on and off, that would be cool...
I am not liking this at all. Someone said it right this should be an improvement to ios5. I believe the reason for not allowing the iPhone 4 to not get these is Verizon and the amount of unlimited data packages out there with a 4 on them. Myself included. I also cannot believe that I will still be interrupted while I am on a phone call by a text or some other meaningless notification. I shouldnt have to put everything on silent or no vibrate to not be bothered. It should "just work" that way. That was a basic function of a "dumb" phone! I am seriously considering goin back to android. Apple has let me down for sure.
You forgot song for alarm tones, which you can see right in the graphic above.
Oh come on now. You cant make a list and put every minor part of each upgrade as an upgrade in itself just for the sake of total new items. As an example, listing each league in sports as an extra enhancement is BS.Its all under one upgrade : Siri & Sport.
Why not just list any and all new commands from Siri and make the iOS the one with over 50,000 new features? :lol: :twisted:
Sigh.. All I really wanted is a voice unlock for my phone so Siri is useful. I hate that I have to unlock my phone by looking at it and putting in my code when I get a new message etc.. Kind of defeats the purpose when using Siri for texting while driving. Seems like it should already be there..
After reading all the comments I think I'm the only one that likes it. Oh well simple mind simple pleasures LOL
You're not the only one. I like it. It's what I was expecting. Still wanting that simultaneous display of 2 apps. There isn't that much left to do but refine. Smartphone functionality has reached the point where they are serving their customers very well, and not only that, there aren't any low hanging fruit left after 5 years of intense evolution and refinement. So improvements today and in the future will have less and less bang for the buck. (When transactional memory comes, maybe that'll spark a new evolution of apps and performance, but software development is slow slow slow compared to hardware).
As for the posts, you have to remember that at least half of them, if not the majority, are troll posts. This is a tradition for Apple updates of any kind. When ever and iOS or iPhone update comes, there will be backlash and troll posts touting how Apple has failed and they are going to move over to competitor phones. It happened for iOS 5, iOS 4, and iOS 3, iOS 2 and even iOS 1.
Good point didn't think about that.
Under safari, "Full Screen video in landscape" is incorrect and is rather "Full Screen browsing in landscape".
At first I was a little disappointed but after using it on my iPad for half a day I'm starting to like it. It's not everything I wanted, widgets would have blown my mind. But it's still nice.
I realize it's only a beta, but how are you finding the performance at this stage?
The iPhone copied every single one of these features from Android 1.0, right down the phone dialer, complete with numbers and letters on the keys.
and so android has copied any phone that has ever had numbers and letters on the keys.........makes sense?
No man, Android had everything FIRST. Everyone else just copied Android. Hell, even people who made maps back colonial American times copied Google Maps.
Good one :D
Dude. Check out Pre-iPhone Android (Looked clearly like a Blackberry clone) and Post-iPhone Android (Looks like and iPhone clone). And it went into "development", change of plans (copying iPhone OS), AFTER the iPhone. Plus, it lacked things like Core Animation.
Android has never lacked anything!!
Any enhancements to Parental Controls?
I have to say I was very pleased with all of the updates and upgrades. Also, there are some new Emoji icons.
I think some of you are missing the point. A lot of the new features are hidden as APIs. Devs will be able to bring us so much more than what we've seen here from Apple. They take pride in the fact their devs have more power here.
Apple is more than just a phone. With an iPhone you get the Apple ecosystem. Anything on my phone I can play on my TV or stereo. With this update I can be looking at a website on my Mac and grab my phone and continue reading on the go. I can play games with Mac users.
The amount of effort they're putting into tying everything together is astounding. Windows isn't even doing this outside of the Xbox. Android can't come close. Sure, I can mess with apps that do somewhat what I'm looking for if I install this and that, click here, oops - restart the phone, set these settings if that case exists, etc. With Apple, I turn on HomeSharing. That's it.
I'm an IT guy by day, I make a lot of money off the consistency at which Microsoft throws errors. When I'm at home I don't want to tweak anything. I don't want to root anything. I don't want to mess with my router's settings. I'm sick of playing with that stuff, I just want it to work. I just want to play music on my stereo, to play a game with my brother in Illinois, to show my girlfriend a YouTube video on the TV or share a webpage with her on her iPad. With Apple I can just do that.
Go get Android's latest. Play with your ICS. It better be worth it, cause you're not getting the next update. Have fun being disconnected.
Still no GROUP sms or send files via bluetooth to other devices :-(
Turn group messaging on in settings. It's been there for a while.
Time/date info for pictures?
Timestamp every text message?
Too much to ask for?
No Siri NASCAR, Formula 1 or Rolex Sports cars series integration? BOOO!!! Did they at least upgrade her voice to sound more female? Doubt it. How bout a method to turn off all that extra Facebook sharing crap I don't want? Wasn't mentioned. :-)
With the new iOS 6 update, you will have the ability to chose what Facebook syncing is allowed. I'm sure most of us don't want our 300+ friends birthdays and phone numbers and other info saved into our iPhones.
The $20 upgrade to Mountain Lion is killer. Microsoft can't even come close to touching that.
I was getting ready to say that. $20 for Mountain Lion is WAAAAAAAY better than $200 for Windows 7.
Who the hell pays $200 for Windows 7?! O_o
Does iOS6 have any better Parental Controls?
At least be able to password protect Setting or many be Wi-Fi.
I would like to be able to change the DNS servers on the Network Adapters for OpenDNS, instead of each Wi-Fi network.
Is there a way to change DNS on Cellular Data?
Don't know about DNS, but for parental controls, there's Guided Access, which basically locks down usage so kids can only use a single app.
What about passworded apps like Facebook and twitter email etc.
So the original iPad and iPod touch generations prior to 4th cannot be upgraded to iOS 6? They become obsolete??
ummm where have you been lately? iPad 1 was obsolete in the beginning of 2011. iPod touch 1, and 2nd generation were obsolete in 2010. the third generation touch was obsolete beginning of this year.
sorry for my english
i have one question ...
will the iOS 6 update be OTA or trough itunes?
We don't know yet but I would guess over the air when it is released.
You can update it on the air, it said so on wwdc
In calendars, you can now share your entire calendar with others right from the app. No more going to iCloud.com to do do.
You did not list one of the best new features in Safari. Search right from the address bar, with results showing up as you type with best match and results from Google, History and other areas. You can skip the Google screen completely by passing all the ads and select the result you want right from the drop down choices in the address line(search box).
Are you sure that's not only in Mountain Lion?
Apple has this all planned out. They're not going to waste ground breaking updates on software (all though maps is pretty sick) when they release a new re-designed phone because they know people will buy. In 2013 when they release the an Iphone 5S with the same form factor they will focus more on software to sell. This year, they will make the new iphone so sexy that no one will care that the OS looks basically the same because the new design will sell. Next year they will probably update the UI a bit more to make it more atteactive on that end when the phone design remains the same. Thats what I think anyway.
only feature I like is the different signature for different email addresses! i have 5 email accounts on my ipad 3 and having one sig. suck total ass.
It would be nice if replied/fowarded emails would sync with Exchange ... meaning that when I reply to an email on the ipad, Exchange/outlook will know that I have replied to it. Right now, ipad shows I replied but Exchange/Outlook think I haven't.
I still see no wifi toggle in the notifications center.
I think the idea is that the iphone / ipad battery lasts long enough for you to keep wifi and bluetooth on continuously. I do that, have about 5 hours of usage a day and still have over 40% battery at the end of the day. The wifi/bluetooth/everything toggles of Android phones are necessary because the code is inefficient enough to burn through giant batteries in hours. Apple's idea is to make the manual fumbling of phone settings unnecessary.
Will we ever see MAP for Bluetooth? I'm convinced it will never happen. At least not until Apple builds an iCar.
Yup, it's on the list.
Android phones from 2008 all have FREE turn-by-turn Nav, but Apple claims the iPhone 4 can't handle it, so only the iPhone 4S and 5 will receive that feature? LAWL!! :D
That new Maps app code must be a real hog...
I wonder what "New iPod app" entails.
I hope any change doesn't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
They just redesigned the color scheme of the app and voulume control bar as far as I can tell
Pretty much, just linked a screenshot.
not a fan of the color scheme. man i hope keeping the original color scheme is optional.
Nice feature list. Too bad those features won't be available for all iOS devices.
I love how Apple poked fun at Android for being so fragmented with different OS versions on different devices, then said "Oh, by the way, many new features won't work on anything but the 4S or the new iPad."
Reminds me of the line from the old cartoon Dr Katz:
"Look how much it takes to bore me"
That's a long list, signifying very little of any interest.
New Emoji
Another minor update I don't see listed here is the ability to "Message" a web address from Safari. I realize it's minor and has been available on other OSs forever, but nonetheless, the lack of it prior to iOS 6 drove me nuts.
Nice list, I do like all the Siri & Map improvements. I still would like to see a live clock and weather app, showing the real time and real temp outside. Maybe even make the weather app light and dark for day and night. Kind of like the jailbreak options.
Looking forward to the update.
Man I can just here the fandroids now. " Big deal we have had this for years". We've had that for years". lol "iOS is just getting that now". It's funny as hell.
The weather app got a redesign too.
hmmm, does the new wallpaper from the ios6 background included in the features?
Coming from android ( HTC Sensation ) I feel cheated because all the IOS updates are old comparing them to a old top android. Apple is ok but I feel it's just missing something and idk what that is. I think anyone that's had a android, meaning 1ghz and up ( not that 600mhz crap ) maybe feel the same way. I will be going back ASAP!!! iPhone is cool just not for me.
Unfortunately I don't see a feature I've been wanting ever since my first iPhone, which is the ability to view metadata on photos. I've got well over 1,000 photos on my iPhone, and it would be nice to know at least the dates of when those photos were taken. You'd think it would be relatively simple for Apple to incorporate this feature into the Photos app--just provide a little "i" icon in the corner of each photo; tap it and the photo flips over to reveal the metadata. I know I can view the metadata after downloading the photos to my Mac, but I want to be able to view it on my iPhone!!!
You can view all photo metadata in Apple's iPhoto app (there is an 'i' button to press when viewing any photo).
I agree. While not in the OS there's an app called "ExifWizard" that does this nicely.
I agree with a lot of statements being made on here about some features that some are so excited about have already been released on WIN7 and Android. My main concern is 4G every carriers network is be bogged down with all these 3G iPhones. I want speed. I would also like the ability to change my fonts like I used to with my Blackberry, even Android had the ability to change fonts or even download apps that would allow you to change fonts. I know it may seem petty but we all have little things we miss if we switched from one smartphone operating system to another.

Noticed inside the App Store, that it no longer sends you to a new page when you want to view the changes to new updates, instead, tapping "View More" will expand the field and show the changes. Super convenient!
Out of their expansive list of over 200 "new" features... the only ones that stand out for me are sharing calenders (finally) and getting notes and reminders in iCloud. The latter is way overdue, it actually should have been there from the get-go. I should be able to just jump on my computer and update notes and see them sync right back to the phone.
Let's not forget folks in all the criticisms that there are people on this planet that living in refuge camps not knowing how they will survive another day. Think about this when you complain about not having a certain feature work a certain way on a PHONE!
i'm really exicted that siri is finally fully functional in the UK at last no more "sorry i can only look for buisness in the united states and when using US english"
All this rubbish anouit my iphone 4 wont get turn by turn firections..listem..to me ...just get TOMTOM from app store its far better than ios6 turn by turn...
cheers TC01
It's actually the same thing... Tomtom made Apple's turn-by-turn. The only difference is that Apple's maps are prettier and include some additional features. Knowing Apple, it will probably run a lot smoother than any other turn-by-turn app in the App Store also, upon its final release this fall.
Also, enough with the debate. Android provides a lot more features, but they don't work as well. Apple provides fewer features that all run smoothly and reliably and integrate with their other products seemlessly. Make your choice.
I don't think this was mentioned but in the App store now you don't get kicked out after you click install. It keeps you in the App store to do more shopping. Also if you already have an app installed you don't need to put your password in to do an update for that app.
No need to leave my Jailbreak
iOS 5 still will not allow AT&T customers to turn off 3G. In remote areas, on the fringe of 3G coverage, this means NO coverage because the hand off to Edge doesn't work properly. I'm sure hoping they put that 3G on/off switch back in for AT&T customers with this upgrade.
Not what you mean by this, Is it an Iphone 4 or 4s, I have a Iphone 3GS (yes Still using it)Running on AT&T (oh man Do I Hate them) running the latest version of IOS 5.1.1, and I am able to disable 3G Service and run off the slower edge services even in the "Remote" Rural Lands around Oregon......
Do the iMessage unifications mean that if somebody sends a message to my phone number (not my email address, or my Apple ID, but my phone number), it will show up on my Wifi iPad or on my MBP? The fact that it doesn't currently has always struck me as somewhere between hackish and stupid, given that this problem has been solved for years by Google Voice or even by XMPP.
Photo upload is safari is nice.
Is the bluetooth control a top menu now...i saw it on the keynote, but wondering if its in the beta?
meh, the vast majority of additions do not interest me. the crippling of mapping as we now know it is a very very very dumb move. It's all political but obviously, Apple doesn't think people need all the basic features we now know and expect from Google maps. But, hey, let's add 3D maps (a red herring) to deflect from the lack of features.
i am long overdue for a hardware upgrade. several things nixed me getting the iPhone. the biggest and most important component is the screen size. this puny 4 inch screen is not really an upgrade. apple will be marketing a larger screen when in fact it's only taller. a 4 inch screen from 3.5 inconsequential. I have an iPad 3, iPod touch 3 gen, and the Samsung Galaxy I. I cant stand the GI, if I see the engineers and software developers, I would have to exhibit a great deal of self control not to throw my phone Samsung at them. There is no dang support from Google whatsoever, the OS is heavily fragmented, apps run in the background robbing your device of system resources, battery, and performance even after you kill them. They keep coming back like a zombie. Yet, I have solidified that I MUST have a larger screen on my mobile device. It must be at leat 4.5 inches, even 5. This was the primary reason to eliminate the iPhone 5. Everything else is incidental. I hope come October, HTC creates a smartphone that has an external SD card not internal because that's we preventing me from getting it. An external SD card is a must with Android because you will need to frequntely wipe out your device because it'll cause you issues if you dont.
Are they ever going to make an iOS were you will be able to send attachments straight from the mail app (not having to download a third party app)? Just wondering. I would really like that!
I'm sorry, I meant documents.
Hey do iOS 6 support iphone4s?
Just because you love oranges doesn't mean apples are gross. Basically get the phone that works for you. With that said I love iPhone for the simple and easy user friendly layout. I also love Android for the cool features. iPhone is just my preference but that doesn't make me loathe an Android. We are talking about a phone. TROLLS GET A LIFE!!
When Steve Jobs described the iPhone as "your life in your pocket" he wasn't kidding. The smartphone and technology is taking over.
Any news on Parental Controls? Can we have more 'control' yet?
Just finished reading this exhaustive thread. You are all so spoiled. I'm old enough to remember rotary dial phones. The iPhone still leaves me in awe even with its "failures". Be glad you have this technology. I find it hard to be snobbish.
Has apple opened up the Bluetooth stack yet to allow pairing with Bluetooth GPS? This is my biggest issue now that email signatures have been dealt with. This is also why Android is looking better to me everyday. I want one device that will do it all and I spend a lot of time in remote areas. Assisted GPS is brutal. It' not GPS.
Why can't Apple just do the simple things well like they used to...
These things should be simple to do:
i) Addresses in iCal should link directly with the new maps app so you don't have to type in the address into another sat nav app each time.
ii) Designate airplane mode to save battery life... ie from 12am - 6am
iii) A simple way to turn off Bluetooth
iv) ABILITY TO CHANGE 'READ' TEXT MESSAGES BACK TO 'UNREAD'!!!!
WHY IS IT SO HARD APPLE?
Thanks for posting this! I'm even more excited about iOS 6 now. I had no idea about some of the small things that were changed that I'm excited about.
Wow, nice comprehensive post! Quick question, anys chance they added the ability to delete apps from the spotlight search (with a swipe) or added the ability to sort apps by name (instead of the standard 'by size') under settings ->general->usage to make it easier to find the apps you want to delete?
Wait so we aren't gonna be able to go under settings -> general -> software update and upload iOS 6... We are going to have to buy on the app store? I mean I was just wondering but a couple of posts said "it would be nice if it wasn't in the store.
From what it sounds like it is a big update jump like from 4 to 5 but that was all under settings -> general -> software update-> But this jump sounds like we are gonna have to pay. Is that right?
I mean I can afford something like that because so far I don't think I could wait until fall. Oh well.:)
The most basic of features that is still absent, but available on Windows phones is the ability to attach a document - other than a photo, to an email thread. Simple, but powerful item that's been neglected.
