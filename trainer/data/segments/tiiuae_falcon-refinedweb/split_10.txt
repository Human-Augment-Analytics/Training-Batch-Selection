Primping Checklist: Week of April 25, 2011
Our editor-approved list of the products, treatments, and trends to try this week.
Prep your hair for spring. Winter's rapid temperature changes (going from extreme indoor heating to bitter outdoor coldness) can stress out strands. We just discovered the Paul Mitchell in-salon KeraTriplex Treatment as an easy, convenient way to give hair the T.L.C. it needs to get ready for a new season. This keratin-based formula was thirty years in the making, and prevents and repairs damage breakage by coating the cuticle with good-for-you ingredients like awapuhi (a type of wild ginger). Yum.
Try a natural toothpaste. Did you know that some whitening toothpastes may be too abrasive for sensitive teeth and gums? The rough edges of ingredients like silica can scratch the gum's surface, causing bleeding and irritation. If you're looking for a gentler way to brush away your Easter-candy indulgences, try a greener toothpaste, like Dentisse Natural Reflection, which is free of chemical additives and uses kaolin (a type of soft clay) to scrub teeth clean.
Get interactive with your makeup purchases. Asking your girlfriends for makeup-buying advice has never been this easy. MAC just launched the Shop Together feature on their site which allows you to chat up with to five friends to discuss which purchases are best-suited for and youand your BFF.
Get an eco-friendly facial. Thanks to Tata Harper, the impossibly chic founder of the self-named, 100% natural skin-care range, going green is now as easy as going to the gym. To slough away dull skin this spring, visit your local Equinox to get the Tata Harper signature facial. Even though all of the ingredients used in Harper's products are grown on her organic Vermont farm, this anti-aging facial delivers uptown-worthy, fast results.

Ghost World Mix: A Story in Sound
Brian Eno once famously remarked that the problem with computers is that there isn't enough Africa in them. I kind of think., but this was the first time I'd been to Angola. The mix reflects a lot of my interests in electronic music from the continent, and the way they've shaped and moulded a lot of material in the "New World.", and vocal outtakes from David Byrne and Brian Eno's "My Life in The Bush of Ghosts."

<|endofexample|>
Last week on The Apprentice, the teams were asked to design and market a line of clothing for women. As a result of bad pricing, Mosaic was sent to the boardroom for the first time in four weeks. Project manager John kept Andy and Kevin with him in the boardroom but was unable to excape the fickle finger of the Trump and was fired. 12 candidates are left – who will be fired this week?
Wes explains to the women why Andy was chosen to stay in the boardroom, saying that John thinks he’s a weak player. He adds that he thinks Andy makes more of a contribution to the team than John does, just as Andy and Kevin return. Ivana tells the group that dinner is ready and they all sit down to a Mexican feast. Just as they’re digging in, the phone rings. It’s Robin, who tells them that Trump wants to see everyone in the boardroom immediately.
Trump asks each team to choose a project manager. Wes and Jennifer are chosen, and Trump explains that he’s realized that the teams are now even. Therefore, it’s time for a corporate restructuring. He wants to see how they will work together with men and women on the same side. He asks Jen and Wes to each choose three people who they don’t want on their team, and those people will go to the other side.
Jen goes first, and she picks Sandy. Wes chooses Raj. Jen sends over Maria and Stacy, and Wes selects Chris and Kevin. Jen’s team is the new Apex, and Wes’ team is the new Mosaic. Trump says that some people may be happy with their new team while others may be upset they were traded away. That’s life, he says, and now is the time for them to all step up to the plate. Sandy is indeed angry to have been traded, and says privately that she’s looking forward to kicking some Apex ass and making Jen regret her decision.
Back in the suite, Wes talks to his new teammates asking what their strengths are. He tells Stacy that he knows she’s good at arguing and asking questions, which of course leads to a ton of questions from Stacy. Wes says privately that he’s never known anyone like her, she just won’t f***ing shut up! Meanwhile, Apex is doing the same thing, but Jen is asking the men to describe each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Raj tells us that Jennifer is analytical, calculating, and beautiful – which makes her especially dangerous.
The following morning the phone rings again, and Rona tells Wes that Trump will meet them all in Central Park at 8am.
In the park, Trump tells the group that the pet business is a 30 billion dollar industry, and points out that New Yorkers truly love their dogs. He wants them to create a dog service business – any type of business they want. At the end of the day, the team who makes the most money wins. George is away again, so Trumps’ Chief Financial Officer is standing in for him. After reminding them that the team who loses will meet with him in the boardroom, Trump is off. Stacy confesses that she’s not a dog person, but will do whatever it takes to win the task.
What would an episode of The Apprentice be without words of wisdom from The Donald? This week the lesson to be learned is “Sell Your Ideas”. As he talks to a contractor about fixing the facade of a building, he tells us that we should go after an idea if we think it’s really that good. Just don’t stop. Once again, thanks Mr. Trump.
Jennifer is on top of things for Apex. She wants to keep things simple, find a high-traffic area, get some supplies, and start washing dogs. Raj and Chris head over to Petco and buy $100 worth of puppy shampoo and dog treats. They go to the location and start washing dogs. Elizabeth and Raj walk around the park telling dog owners about the “Doggy Makeover” station, but don’t seem to have much success. Apparently a lot of people don’t carry cash with them while walking their dogs – go figure.
Raj wants to set up a second station in another location, but Jen shoots him down. She doesn’t want the team split up. Raj confesses he thinks the team is walking down the path to defeat and doom.
Over at Mosaic, Kelly is already annoyed with Stacy, who is asking questions. She wants to know why people would trust them with their dogs. Wes wants to donate some of their proceeds to charity, but has trouble finding an organization who will accept it. Andy and Kelly head out to get supplies, and Andy finds a cat shelter that is open and will take their donations. When they return to join the rest of their team, Andy leaves the cellphone in the taxi which throws a wrench in their plans since now they can’t split up and still stay in contact.
Apex is still washing dogs, and Raj still wants to split the group up. Jen finally agrees and sends Ivana and Chris out to massage dogs. They charge a dollar a minute or $10 for 15 minutes. Chris, who is really getting full of himself, is mortified at having to massage the dogs. He says that he’s got a “Rolex Presendential” on, and he’s sitting there massaging someone’s dog. “It was just so degrading and embarassing” he adds, pointing out that the dog smelled bad too. Suck it up Chris and deal with it.
Mosaic is still setting up shop, adding a sign advertising “Extreme Doggie Makeovers”. They’ve already missed the busiest time of the day for dog-walkers, so they need to ahul ass to catch up. Andy had thought of buying Polaroid cameras to take before and after shots, and Stacy wants to take the idea one step further. She suggests that they buy some dog costumes and take photos of dogs wearing the outfits. Wes indulges Stacy and they go to look at some outfits. The costumes are too expensive, so the two of them have just wasted more time.
After washing a few dogs and giving massages, Apex starts clipping canine nails. Kevin is nervous as he knows that a dog has very sensitive claws. Jen doesn’t seem phased though, and clips away even when the dogs squeal in pain.
Carolyn watches as Mosaic washes dogs. She says that it looks like they’re doing well. Sandy and Kelly are washing the dogs, and Carolyn says they look like they’re having fun. She says that Maria is walking around looking provocative, and looks like she’s marketing herself rather than the dog wash, Andy is running around after customers like a ‘lawyer in an ambulance’, and “Stacy is, uh, I haven’t figured out what Stacy is doing yet.” Sandy says privately that it annoyed her that Stacy didn’t offer a drink of water or to take over for a few minutes, and then at the end of the day Stacy had the nerve to complain that she was filthy. Wes says that if they win he’ll be a hero but if they lose he’ll be a jackass.
It’s 8pm and Apex is closing up shop. They go back to the suite for a shower and head out for a few drinks and something to eat. Jen is proud of the way she handled the task, but Ivana thinks that Jen is too quick to take credit.
Time for the results of the task. Everyone gathers in the boardroom, and Trump asks Jennifer what it was like to lead a new team. She thinks it was challenging but think she did a good job. Wes is asked the same question, and says that his team is hard-working.
Carolyn, in overdub, says that she thinks Mosaic got started a little late. She adds that they made a profit of $122.12, and did okay.
Alan says that Apex had a very good plan. They were diversified not only in location but in services offered. Their profit was $307.41. Trump congratulates Apex, and tells them that their reward is a meeting with the mayor, Michael Bloomberg. He reminds Mosaic that he’ll see them later that evening where someone will be fired.
Apex heads over to Gracie Mansion, where several NY mayors have lived. Mayor Bloomberg uses the property for official functions, however. Ivana is excited because Mayor Bloomberg is a successful businessman who has also succeeded in politics. He gives them some advice and answers their questions. Raj says that any time there is a reward that involves acquiring knowledge from people who have succeeded, it is much more valuable than a fancy dinner because knowledge is power, and that can never be taken away from you.
In the suite meanwhile, Stacy is talking everyone’s ear off. She’s not disappointed that they didn’t think of a dog massage because it’s hideous, disgusting, and unnecessary. She thinks they missed out on a goldmine by not jumping on the costume thing. Wes says privately that there’s no way Stacy will end up being the Apprentice because people don’t have confidence in her. He promises her that he will not badmouth her in the boardroom, if she promises the same thing. Stacy tells the camera that Wes screwed up on the task and he’s going to be fired tonight. We shall see Stacy, we shall see.
Time for some firin’. In the boardroom, Trump reminds Maria that she’s exempt this week, so she is free to speak her mind. She says that the problem was leadership. Kelly agrees, pointing out that they missed out on the prime doggy washing hours. Carolyn asks him how many dogs he washed in the first two hours, and he guesses eight. She corrects him and says it was four. Trump says he hates people who exaggerate. He wonders if the traffic flow was because they were in the wrong location. Wes says that he wanted to try another location, but it was difficult because Andy had lost their cell phone.
Trump tells Andy that he’s been a bit of a disaster so far, even though he’s been sticking up for him all along. Wes explains that Andy needs a lot of supervision during tasks, and Andy defends himself by saying that he closed the deal with the charity when Wes failed. Donald isn’t impressed with the cat shelter, saying that “the last thing dogs wanna know is that they’re helping cats”. Alan pipes in and says that they should have added more in the lines of services.
Stacy is then asked if she thinks she should take any blame for the loss. She says no, and that she would fire Andy if she had the choice. Wes says that Kelly and Sandy worked hard and are completely accountable for what they did, and Maria is exempt. Therefore he would like to bring Andy and Stacy back into the boardroom with him. Trump sends the rest of them back to the suite, and the three remaining to the lobby.
Carolyn thinks Stacy didn’t produce, Andy is all over the place, and Wes is a poor leader. Alan thinks that Andy made a huge mistake in losing the cell phone – if this was a military operation and he lost his communication, he could have lost his entire batallion. However, he does feel that Stacy was under the radar and doesn’t know what she actually did besides debate everyone. Trump nods and asks Robin to send them back in.
Trump asks Wes why he brought Stacy into the boardroom. He says that she wastes time with her banter. Trump wants to know why he didn’t listen to Stacy’s idea, and Wes explains that it would have been too expensive for the amount of time they had.
Stacy says that the idea for the costumes was great, since they had the camera laying around anyway. Carolyn asks her if she’s just a bad salesperson who can’t get her ideas across. She adds that it’s been seven weeks now and she’s still trying to figure out what Stacy brings to the table. Trump echoes that and asks Stacy what she brings. She starts to explain that she was promoting, and Carolyn shoots her down again.
Andy is asked if Stacy could be a good leader. Andy says that she does have some good ideas, but actually getting them implemented is something she needs to work on. Carolyn and Alan both try to explain to Stacy that she needs to step up and sell her ideas (just like Trump’s lesson of the week!). Wes agrees with them and says he feels that he is a very strong leader. Trump disagrees, and says that Wes was a lousy leader. He adds that losing the phone was a stupid move on Andy’s part.
Trump further blasts Stacy for not taking responsibility for anything, and she reacts by asking them to make her project manager. Carolyn tells her they won’t do that – she has to do it herself. Trump (in another bad overdub) tells Stacy that week after week she makes excuses and is always complaining. When she failed to sell her idea, she blamed the project manager. So…Stacy, you’re fired.
There’s a little awkward scene in the lobby where Wes looks like he’s going to give Stacy a hug or a peck on the cheek, and Stacy hides behind her suitcase repeating “Good luck Wes”, and shakes his hand. Trump says that he really didn’t like the fact that Stacy kept making excuses.
In the cab, Stacy says that she feels that Wes tried to pin the loss on her. She thinks Trump didn’t get a chance to get to know her, but she wouldn’t change anything about the way she handled things.
Couple of random side notes. First, the overdubs are annoying and distracting. Surely NBC can blend these better into the dialogue? Also, I am loving the fact that Carolyn is getting more air time. We haven’t been able to see much of her personality outside of the boardroom, but these last couple of weeks during the tasks her commentary has been interesting and very, very funny.

Going Bald Sends Men to the Tattoo Parlor
Makenzie on 5 Jun 2012 at 4:00pm
An new technique to disguise balding has men headed to the tattoo parlor, so to speak. HIS Hair Clinics uses tattooing to mimic the appearance of closely buzzed hair.
Can you tell where the hair ends and the tattoo begins?
"We replicate each individual hair follicle for a totally natural appearance," reads the HIS website, emphasizing the procedure is not similar to scalp shading. They call it Micro Hair Technique, or MHT®.
While traditional tattoos may discolor over time, HIS claims that their specialized pigments will remain true-to-color.
The pictures are pretty impressive -- and the website has a plethora of video testimonials from happy patients.
They list the average cost as £2,500 GBP for one procedure, which is about $3,850 USD. From the videos and site info, it sounds like most people will need at least two treatments if not a few more.
A hair transplant procedure costs an average of $9,000, so depending on your coverage needs MHT may be slightly cheaper. But, even if you have some hair left you are committing to a barely-there-buzz cut for good.
For guys like Kyle, the boost in confidence makes the change in hairstyle seem well worth it:
What do you think about the latest hair loss treatment? Could we see an increase in buzz-headed men?
Photo credit: HIS Hair Clinic
I can't tell the difference. It looks really good!
What happens when they go grey though?
That is a really good question, Sharon! HIS does say that the pigment can fade over long periods of time, due to sun and other elements. So i supposed it could be touched up with grey. However, I guess you could also dye the real hair to match at that point?
I will contact them and ask :)
Oh my gosh, this is brilliant!!!!

If. Now, two astronomers from the Astrobiology Institute at the University of Arizona have come up with a new twist on the fine-tuning of a planet’s rotation rate.1
The astronomers point out that a rapid rotation rate is the normal state for an Earth-like planet. The only reason why Earth is not rotating much more rapidly is because it has lost most of its angular momentum to its very large and nearby moon. The presently slow rotation rate of Earth prevents an even greater catastrophe for advanced life than the problem of poorly distributed rainfall.
The relatively slow rotation rate establishes an efficient transport of heat from the equatorial regions of the planet to the poles. Such heat transport prevents the polar regions from becoming so cold that the buildup of ice and even frozen carbon dioxide would destabilize the global climate. This result would cause a runaway glaciation2 that would lead to much of the planet becoming frozen for long periods of time.
Thankfully, Earth’s gigantic moon slows the planet's rotation rate. Thanks also to the Creator for introducing just the right life-forms at just the right times throughout the past 3.8 billion years, and for creating human beings at just the right time in Earth’s history. Humanity enjoys both the optimal rotation rate for sustaining global high-technology civilization and the optimal support base from the planet’s past and present plants and animals.
Gratitude can also be extended to the two astronomers, whose research and insights provide the human species with even more evidence for the supernatural, superintelligent design of the Earth, Moon, and Earth’s life for humanityâ€™s specific benefit.

(BPT) - Modern or current may not be the word that comes to mind when you think of cottage cheese but this dairy case classic is experiencing a resurgence that is taking it beyond the diet plate to a starring role in how consumers eat today.
Low-fat cottage cheese is high in protein, low in calories and fat and minimally processed. Its versatility, price and nutritional profile make it a must have in any healthy kitchen and its popularity is on the rise. In fact, Health magazine named it one of the “flashback foods of the year.”
Today, cottage cheese is anything but plain. With its light flavor and creamy texture, cottage cheese makes a delicious and healthy base for a host of dishes. Have a favorite high-fat dip? Swap out the mayo for low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese. You’ll add calcium and protein without compromising flavor. In the mood for a creamy dressing? Blend cottage cheese, herbs and spices for a rich-tasting, low calorie dressing for salads from greens to pasta.
It’s also a perfect addition to your morning pancake mix. Mild, creamy cottage cheese mixed with lightly sweetened batter forms tender, delicious California Cottage Cheese Pancakes with the added bonus of a healthy dose of protein. While people tend to add fruit and other “sweet” additions to cottage cheese, don’t overlook savory ingredients like chopped artichoke hearts, olives, nuts or even salsa.
The dairy experts at the California Milk Advisory Board (CMAB) have developed two Mediterranean-inspired modern cottage cheese plate recipes that will suit any palate or occasion. Go Greek with fresh, flavorful ingredients like cucumbers, red peppers, herbs and olives. And, when you’re craving the rich flavors of Italy, look no further than the Modern Italian Cottage Cheese Plate. Dried tomatoes, basil, garlic, lemon and pine nuts mixed with cottage cheese combine for a guest-worthy salad or dip when served with baguette slices or multi-grain crackers.
The Modern Cottage Cheese Plate: Italian
Ingredients:
1 cup California low-fat cottage cheese
1 tablespoon finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh basil
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups baby arugula
2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted
3/4 cup red and yellow grape tomatoes
1/2 cup mixed olives
6 whole grain baguette slices
3 teaspoons Real California butter
Directions:
Spread butter lightly on baguette slices and toast. Stir together cottage cheese, tomatoes, basil, garlic and lemon zest in a small bowl. Place arugula onto two plates and top with cottage cheese. Sprinkle with pine nuts and surround with tomatoes, olives and baguette slices. Makes two servings.
A cup of cottage cheese is a high protein choice that provides calcium and is available in low-fat and fat-free varieties. It’s an excellent source of satiating protein, which means it keeps you full and may prevent you from overeating. Which is why putting cottage cheese or other dairy products on that “diet” plate or any plate isn’t off the mark. According to registered dietitians with Dairy Council of California people who consume more calcium and dairy foods as part of a balanced diet tend to weigh less and/or have less body fat than those who consume less dairy. Plus, this dairy original is convenient, versatile and readily-available. Try mixing cottage cheese with fresh fruit or cucumber for a refreshing snack.
Real California milk is used in a variety of quality dairy products from cottage cheese to yogurt. Make sure to look for the Real California Milk and Cheese seals to guarantee you’re getting products made with 100 percent California milk from California dairy farmers.

TIPS: Is there a story we should be covering?
From the Winter 2012 issue of Redlands Magazine
For its residents, Redlands is a special place, endowed with a long-held sense of community and a generous giving spirit. Nowhere is that more evident than through the philanthropic works of these people who have given of themselves in some way - through time, money or both - to help ensure a future filled not only with promise, but with actions as well. These individuals perform good works not for glory or recognition, but because of who they are. Each has a strong sense of community and wants to give back.
Cyndy Dunham
It's a dog's life
Cyndy Dunham volunteers at the Redlands Animal Shelter for a simple reason: "I'm just an animal lover, and there are so many that need help. I can't say no," she says.
The 57-year-old Yucaipa resident, who has a full-time job as a legal assistant, has been a regular presence at the shelter for 11 years. She used to work there part time in a paid position scrubbing kennels, until back surgery earlier this year forced her to quit that job because physically it became too difficult.
But Dunham still regularly reports to the shelter - as a volunteer. She fosters homeless dogs that are pregnant or have had new puppies, keeping them at her home until they are at least 10 weeks old and ready for adoption. She also brings shelter dogs to Redlands City Council meetings to encourage adoption, and she gets the word out about the shelter and its events. And, she oversees the shelter's volunteers and is writing a handbook for them.
Volunteers fill a variety of roles at the facility. Bonnie Hopson, for example, organizes adoption events at Stell Coffee & Tea Co.; Anges Ferrara raised funds for the shelter through the Redlands Run and purchased needed antibiotics for the dogs; Steve and Kim Salt take dogs and needed supplies to off-site adoption events and have paid part of the adoption fees for some of the new owners; and Bonnie
"I'm really such a small link to a huge chain of very giving volunteers," Dunham said.
After growing up in Yorba Linda on an acre-sized property with horses, pigs and geese, it wasn't until years later - when Dunham got involved with helping dogs - that she learned how many pets were given up by their owners.
"It was shocking to me - the unclaimed animals," she said. "We don't get wild animals at the shelter. They come from homes, somebody owned them."
Dunham enjoys comforting dogs brought to the shelter, and often sits with them while they get shots.
"They're dependent on us, and they give us so much in return," she said.

Roger Bell
All across America, happy trails
The great outdoors is something Dr. Roger Bell has spent his life sharing with others through his work designing and building trails across America. And that includes trails close to home as well, including several in Redlands, the San Bernardino National Forest and the hills above Yucaipa and Mentone.
In Redlands, Bell helped set up the Oakmont, Creekside and Teddy's trails, plus another one in Caroline Park. He's a Redlands Conservancy board member and also vice chairman of American Trails, a national organization.
Trail-building endeavors provide a sense of closure and the satisfaction of finishing something, says Bell, a former dean of students at the University of Redlands with a doctorate in higher education.
"One thing I like about building trails is there is a beginning and an end," he said. "You get to see something on the ground that wasn't there before. You see some pretty amazing places."
Trail building isn't something Bell, 77, picked up in retirement. He started doing it some 40 years ago, joining his brother, a contractor and trail builder for the U.S. Forest Service and other public agencies. Bell's business, Bellfree Contractors Inc., also designed and built trails and bridges.
After
"It's about the funny things that happen in the back country when you least expect it," he said.
Bell also is co-founder of the Redlands Sustainability Network, which promotes local food growers and sustainable living practices. The group is planning a sustainability festival at the University of Redlands on March 9.

Don Gifford
Always helping, always making a difference
Since the 1960s, when Don Gifford was a teacher and football coach at Redlands High School, he has believed it's important to provide positive influences for young people and to make a difference in their lives.
Through the years, he has donated his talents and countless hours to many Redlands-based nonprofits including the Micah House, Redlands Family YMCA and the Redlands Educational Partnership Foundation.
"I'm not a wealthy guy so I can't be one of those big donors, but I can serve. That's what I feel is in my bailiwick, so that's what I try to do," he said.
"It also gives me a chance to meet people I wouldn't ordinarily get to meet."
While age may have limited his mobility somewhat, the 78-year-old Gifford plans to continue his philanthropic efforts for as long as possible.
"I don't like to sit around too much," he said. "Not only do I enjoy what I am doing, but young people need so much help these days. Everywhere I look, I see great need."
Gifford and his wife, Marjorie, moved from Los Angeles to Redlands in 1957. The Pepperdine University graduate says all he ever wanted to do was be a coach, teacher and counselor. After his stint at Redlands High, he was the head football coach at Big Bear High School from 1970 to 1980.
After that, Gifford went on to become the vice principal at Beaumont High School and remained in that position until he retired in 1994.
Since then, Gifford has been a volunteer instructor for the Redlands Unified School District's home-school program. He also participates in ongoing fundraisers for the Redlands Educational Partnership Foundation, which provides funds and grants for school programs in the arts, science, music and math.
For the YMCA, he has long been a part of the organization's annual sustaining drive, which raises funds to help families with the cost of Y memberships and help kids go to camp.
"The relationships I have with young people are the best in the world," Gifford said. "I encourage everyone who can to get involved with nonprofits that do so much for kids. This work is so important, and we can never have enough people out there doing it."

Working toward the future
Dianne Landeros has a vision for the future of Redlands, where she has lived for 37 years, and she's working to make it happen.
"My vision includes the beautiful things about Redlands we all love - the beautiful character, old buildings, beautiful architecture, spirit of involvement. We want to preserve all of those good things," she said.
"I would like to see sustainable groups. We could do more in terms of tourism in Redlands. This is a beautiful little town."
Landeros backs efforts to preserve historic sites, supports local and "green" businesses, opposes big-box chain stores (including the Walmart Supercenter that the City Council recently approved) and promotes local sustainability. She's involved with many organizations including the Redlands Good Neighbor Coalition, which she co-founded, and the Redlands Sustainability Network.
She's also is active in the Democratic Party (her husband, Steve Chapman, is president of the Redlands area Democratic Club); has been on the steering committee of Women United, a group of progressive women in Redlands who have registered voters and held forums to educate voters about ballot propositions and local candidates, without making endorsements; and she is on the board of Planned Parenthood for Orange and San Bernardino counties.
Landeros helps organize non-partisan Common Cause forums that are held at the A.K. Smiley Public Library every two months to encourage people to become involved in the democratic process.
She also works with Step By Step, a community re-entry coalition for parolees that she co-founded in 2006. The group provides bus passes to parolees so they can get to work or school; connects them with literacy, tattoo removal and job-help programs, and helps them in other ways. The goal is to help parolees so they don't re-offend.
"What I like is that I can stand up for what I believe in and try to make a difference," said Landeros, 66, a retired human resources officer for the Riverside County Health Services Agency. Her daughter, Toni Momberger, is editor of the Redlands Daily Facts.
"You don't just want to complain about things you don't like," Landeros added. "Being retired, I can now devote my time to the things I think are most important."

Redlands Day Nursery
Second century of caring for kids
EDITOR'S NOTE: When we were soliciting suggestions for Heroes of Giving, Redlands Day Nursery was mentioned more than once. We opted to write about the nonprofit agency, and not focus on any single staff member.
Throughout its history, the 106-year-old Redlands Day Nursery has continued to grow both in size and mission.
It was founded in 1906 by Mrs. C.W. Merriman with the aim of providing day care for underprivileged children whose parents worked in the citrus groves and packing houses. The original building was located in Merriman's home, on the corner of Pearl and Orange streets.
Today, the nursery has expanded to two locations (1041 E. Brockton Ave. and 1643 Plum Lane), and provides services for more than 200 children. Its full- or part-time services are now open to all children, ages 2 to pre-kindergarten.
"Until recently, our center was com-pletely funded by the state and families had to qualify to get their children in our program," said Elvia Clavesilla, RDN program director. "While we still offer admittance through the state-funded program, we have now opened our services up to everyone though parent-paid tuition."
Tuition fees, along with community donations and state subsidies, help keep RDN in business, Clavesilla says. The center also relies on an annual campaign drive for its survival.
"We have always had a lot of support from the Redlands community. That has helped us flourish through the years," said Barbara Park, president of RDN's board of directors. "And we are very grateful for everyone who has contributed, as donations are crucial."
Staff loyalty also has played a large part in RDN's stability. Many instructors have been there for more than 30 years.
"All of our staff members are highly-trained in the developmental, cognitive, cultural and linguistic needs of every child," Clavesilla said. "They also are very diverse and speak different languages, which allows us to better accommodate everyone."
Along with providing a rich educational experience, RDN also offers three healthy meals per day, as well as an afternoon snack. Loma Linda University students visit the center periodically and hold nutrition workshops for staff and parents.
"We are definitely moving in a new direction as we become less dependent on state funds," Park said. "Next year, we hope to open up more community-based classes through our tuition program. We want to get the word out that we are here for anyone who needs us."

What is long-term care insurance and why do you need it?
A simple Google Internet search yields a definition for insurance as, "a practice by which a company provides a guarantee of compensation for a specific loss." Therefore, long-term care insurance is a practice by which a company provides a guarantee of compensation should you ever need long-term care or assistance with bathing, dressing, eating, toileting or transferring. Long-term care includes a variety of services that may be both medically and/or non-medically necessary for people with a chronic illness or disability.
Planning for long-term care requires you to consider possible future long-term care needs and costs. It is important to plan for long-term care before you need it, and before a crisis occurs. By planning your choices now, you will have more control over your individual situation, possibly remaining independent longer. Making long-term care decisions can be very difficult, even when you plan ahead.
Although most people cannot imagine themselves ever needing help with these activities of daily living, most people can imagine their loved ones needing care. If your parents are older than 70, it probably seems possible that they might need help at some point, or you have actually seen them need care. Can you imagine your partner needing care? What are the consequences should a family member unexpectedly need daily assistance?
Now consider the other insurance products you already have in your life. Auto insurance covers losses to your personal income in the event of an auto accident or theft. Health insurance covers losses to your income in the event of illness or injury, saving you potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime. Life insurance helps provide for your loved ones in the event of your death, providing for a continued source of income.
As the provider for your family, you have taken steps to protect your family from catastrophic losses beyond your control.
Now, what happens if you have a major stroke or heart attack and can no longer bathe, dress or eat without assistance? What happens if your partner is involved in a catastrophic event and requires daily care? Who will provide the care and how will the care be paid for?
You may never need long-term care. Even if you make careful plans and arrangements, you may never need it. According to the U.S.."
Are you prepared?
Next time, I'll address the erroneous belief that long-term care is freely covered under Medicare and Obamacare.
To learn more, send your questions or comments to questions@LTCFacts.org.
Carolyn Olson is founder of LTCFacts.org, a website providing short articles about long-term care insurance to help people make decisions about buying long-term care insurance.

Scopus Announced as One of the Primary Tools for Research Assessment of Russian Universities
MOSCOW, September 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ –
Scopus recognized by Russian Ministry of Education and Science as key
database for reaching international standards of excellence in education and science
Elsevier [ ], a world-leading provider of scientific, technical
and medical information products and services, announces that Scopus is officially
confirmed as one of the primary requirements for the research assessment of all Russian
universities. Alexander A. Klimov, PhD., Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Russia,
formalizes this decision through Scopus’ inclusion in the Government’s regulating act
titled “Russia’s Assessment of Higher Education Effectiveness”.
As the Russian Ministry of Education and Sciences enforces international
competitiveness of Russian education and science, applying international standards and
practices for evaluation of the quality of higher education and its research is a crucial
step in the process. With Scopus now recognized as the official tool for effective
research assessment of Russian universities, the Government aims to map its research
performance and international research collaboration trends more effectively, as well as
support its research funding strategies objectively.
Olga Moskaleva, PhD, Head of Department of Scientific Research, St. Petersburg State
University, said of the inclusion of Scopus in the act, “Effective R&D assessment is key
for strategic research funding and development within Russia. With Scopus now officially
recognized by the Government as one of the tools to achieve effective research assessment,
Russia will soon be able to reflect on past, current and future research trends, helping
our Universities to be more competitive in the global academic arena.”
Ivan Sterligov, Director of the Center of Situational Analysis, Ministry of Education
and Science, noted, “With the ongoing reform of the higher education and science structure
across Russia we see insight into all major bibliometric indices as crucial to be able to
objectively reflect on our research landscape, also in comparison with other parts of the
world. Scopus will help all Russian universities present and analyze the most important
bibliometric indices.”
Igor Osipov, PhD, Elsevier Regional Director for Russia and Belarus said, “We are
honored to now see Scopus’ official recognition in the Minstery’s act. Using Scopus helps
enhance the Ministry’s aim to improve the quality and international reputation of Russian
research output. Not only will Scopus help Russian universities assess the ‘bigger
picture,’ it will also help identify and reward teams and individual researchers and their
institutions conducting world-class work in Russia.”

none. The film's Big Baddie, Kronos the Titan, looks ready to go twelve rounds with Optimus Prime. The action is video game-inspired, perhaps more than slightly influenced by the God of War series. The storyline bears a passing resemblance to that of Immortals, although neither film does more than occasionally borrow from classic Greek mythology. Zeus undergoes a particularly vicious form of character assassination, but director Jonathan Liebesman needn't worry since it's unlikely he'll sue.
Wrath of the Titans is a sequel to 2010's Clash of the Titans (a remake of the 1981 feature of the same name). Like its predecessor, Wrath of the Titans is interested exclusively in spectacle. The characters are uninteresting and the quest-based storyline is dumb but the filmmakers offer enough special effects-charged battles that one is occasionally tempted to concentrate on the things that work and forget about all the other stuff. Still, there's a sense that Liebesman wants to make the central conflict epic but he is undone by time constraints. The movie breezes by at the fastest pace imaginable, pausing only occasionally for moments of exposition. The climax, which features an army of humans facing off against demonic creatures straight out of Tartarus, can best be described as perfunctory.
The movie picks up about a dozen years after the first one ended. Perseus (Sam Worthington), the slayer of the Kraken, has become a hermit, living in relative isolation as a fisherman with his only son, Helius (John Bell). His wife, Io, has died because Gemma Arterton elected not to appear in yet another special effects-driven movie. Meanwhile, on Olympus, things aren't going so well. People have stopped praying to the gods and this lack of faith is sapping their powers. Their ability to hold together the prison of the Titans is weakening, and things get worse when Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares (Edgar Ramirez) agree to a pact with Kronos to betray Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Poseidon (Danny Huston). Perseus is forced back into action to rescue Zeus from Tartarus. He takes with him Agenor (Toby Kebbell), the half-human son of Poseidon, and Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), the princess (now queen) he saved from the Kraken. In Greek mythology (and the 1981 Clash of the Titans), Perseus and Andromeda were an item. With Io out of the way, Wrath of the Titans falls into line, although this relationship is unromantic even by male teen-oriented action movie standards.
Sam Worthington is not an actor of great range, but his popularity has made him a major casting choice over the last few years. In Wrath of the Titans, he gives us a hero so brooding as to make Christian Bale's Batman seem like the life of the party. During the 99-minute running time, Perseus may not crack a single smile, although he scowls a lot. Despite the he-man appearance, it turns out he's not much of a fighter, either. For much of the movie, he's a punching bag for assorted monsters (chimera, Cyclops, the Minotaur, etc.) and Ares.
If Andromeda looks a little different than in the first movie, that's because she is now played by Rosamund Pike (instead of Alexa Davalos who, like Arterton, determined that avoiding Wrath was a good career move). Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson return as Olympians, once again fooling us into thinking there must be some substance here. I'd love to know how many numbers preceded the decimal points on their paychecks. I must admit there's some pleasure to be had watching these two share the screen, although it's not sufficient to save the movie. Their dialogue doesn't reverberate with Shakespearean profundity. At times, it's more in line with the utterances of Ming the Merciless.
Having endured the abomination that passed for a 3-D conversion on Clash of the Titans, I elected to spare myself the torture of a repeat - you know the saying: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." So I skipped the (3-D) press screening and saw it at a (2-D) regular showing. I therefore cannot speak to the quality of the hopefully improved 3-D but can say the version I saw was bright, busy, and chock full of chaotic action scenes. And if I was confused by the fights in 2-D, I can only imagine what they looked like through the glasses.
While watching Wrath of the Titans, I tried to imagine how I might have felt about it with 30 years shaved off my age. As a teenager, I probably would have thought of it as being cool but inconsequential. A diversion, but nothing to dwell upon. I would have forgotten about it on the way home in the car. I can't say my overall impression as a 40-something is much different. Wrath of the Titans is not painful. It's noisy and frustratingly shallow but not boring. It typifies the kind of thing that happens when a movie exists solely because its predecessor was successful at the box office. Like Twilight, this is a product made with a specific demographic in mind. The rest of us can shake our heads sadly and remember that not all movies - big budget or not - are as soulless as this one.

Earlier today the Oscar Nominations were announced. But are movies like Atonement, Juno, Michael Clayton, There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men really the Best Movies of 2007?
We think they're pretty good, but some of 2007's true gems have been overlooked and long-since forgotten. Oscar has a notoriously short attention span, so when a movie comes out pre-November, it can pretty much kiss its awards hopes good-bye.
Here are nine forgotten movies of 2007 we thought deserved a second chance. All of them are now available on DVD or pay-per-view services.

3:10 to Yuma
Reelz Rating (out of 10):
Award(s) It Was Forgotten For: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor
In a Nutshell: Smart, gritty western even non-western fans loved.
Why It's Award-Worthy: Westerns are always a tough sell and this one was no exception, although you have to question Lionsgate's decision to open it in the dead season of early September. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are two of the finest actors of their generation, a paring akin to DeNiro and Pacino in Heat. Ben Foster offers the year's finest supporting performance as the cold-hearted killer Charlie Prince.

The Lookout
Award(s) It Was Forgotten For: Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor
In a Nutshell: Great thriller, great story, great acting.
Why It's Award-Worthy: Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Chris Pratt, a local high school football hero whose life is destroyed by a tragic car accident. His memory comes and goes now he works as a janitor at a local bank. When he falls in with a bad gang and winds up the pawn of a bank robbery, he must turn to his only friend for help - Jeff Daniels in an amazing performance as his blind roommate.
Rescue Dawn
Award(s) It Was Forgotten For: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor
Why It's Award-Worthy: How this movie is not being talked about this awards season is a mystery to me. Christian Bale is Lt. Dieter Dengler, a real-life German-American who was shot down and captured during his first flight over Loas. He organizes a daring escape from the P.O.W. camp, eventually left with only one friend in the lonely jungles, the decisively less positive-thinking Duane Martin (Steve Zahn in the finest work of his career). Dawn is a thrilling, heartbreaking, near-masterpiece.

Black Snake Moan
Award(s) It Was Forgotten For: Best Actor
In a Nutshell: Sam Jackson is almost unrecognizable as former bluesman Lazarus in this sexually-charged tribute to 70's exploitation.
Why It's Award-Worthy: When Laz (Jackson) discovers a young, pretty nymphomaniac (Christina Ricci) lying beaten and broken outside his house, he decides it is his chance to find a little bit of redemption by saving her soul. While his methods may be questioned by some - he chains her to a radiator in her panties midriff-baring shirt - his heart is in the right place. Directed by Hustle and Flow's Craig Brewer, Black Snake Moan is nothing if not a highly original cinematic trip.

Reign Over Me
Award(s) It Was Forgotten For: Best Actor, Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay
In a Nutshell: A touching story of post 9/11 trauma and a great story of friendship.
Why It's Award-Worthy: Instead of focusing on the events of 9/11 as did United 93 or World Trade Center, Reign explores the not-so-uncommon fallout of survivor's guilt. The unlikely Adam Sandler gives the best performance of his career as Charlie Fineman, whose wife and three daughters were killed during the World Trade attacks. When his college roommate Alan Johnson (the incomparable Don Cheadle) re-enters his life, Charlie starts to face the facts of what's happened to his world.

Bug
Award(s) It Was Forgotten For: Best Adapted Screenplay
In a Nutshell: Great performances highlight this intense, simple little thriller.
Why It's Award-Worthy: Based on a one-room play by Tracy Letts, Ashley Judd is Agnes White, a white trash addict whose abusive husband (Harry Connick, Jr.) returns from prison to discover she's met a new man - quiet-natured hunk Peter Evans (Michael Shannon). The bigger issue at hand is that Peter has brought with him an invasion of creepy crawly bugs that no one can see. He claims it's all part of a military experiment, but he might also just be completely out of his gourd.

Sunshine
Award(s) It Was Forgotten For: Best Visual Effects
In a Nutshell: Highlighted by gorgeous visuals, director Danny Boyle offers up a thinking man's sci-fi thriller with equal parts Alien and 2001.
Why It's Award-Worthy: The biggest, best sci-fi movie of 2007 that no one saw. Set in the not-too-distant future where the sun is nearing extinction, Earth is in a constant state of winter weather. The only hope to save mankind? Re-ignite the sun. After the first mission mysteriously vanishes, the crew of the Icarus II is sent on a semi-suicidal mission to look for the missing Icarus I and take their own payload (essentially a massive bomb) straight into the heart of the sun.

The Hunting Party
Award(s) It Was Forgotten For: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay
In a Nutshell: Richard Shepard (The Matador) keeps the faith with his sophomore effort in this smart, black dramedy about journalists who risk their lives hunting down war criminals in Bosnia.
Why It's Award-Worthy: Based on a true story about Esquire journalist Scott Anderson's trip to Sarajevo hunting for rather easy-to-find war criminals, The Hunting Party attracted A-list talent like Richard Gere and Terrence Howard. You've probably never ever heard of it, but this intelligent, funny, tense, touching and disturbing film cements writer/director Richard Shepard's position as an auteur. It's distinctly Shepard, and it's distinctly good.

Broken English
Award(s) It Was Forgotten For: Best Screenplay, Best Actress
In a Nutshell: Written and directed by Zoe Cassavetes, and starring Parker Posey, Broken English tells the story of a single thirty something New Yorker trying to navigate the rough waters of finding romance in a sea of loneliness.
Why It's Award-Worthy: This romantic dramedy may be full of indie royalty, but you don't have to be an art house aficionado to appreciate it. So much more than just a Bridget Jones or Sex and the City rip off, Broken English is full of surprising depth and compassion for a normally fluffy subject matter. If you've ever been single and sad about it, this movie is an absolute must-see. Plus, French actor Melvil Poupaud is beyond hot.

Juno, Michael Clayton, There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men.
NO THERE NOT THE BEST MOVIES OF 07.I didn't know There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men are movies that came out in 07 because very little people knew about them.I feel they really don't deserve the nod.A movie should get a nod if only everyone know about it ''BIG BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE''
I thought 3:10 to Yuma would get a nod but guess not.I was SHOCKED that Pirates 3 didn't get BEST PICTURE NOD.
Yes i do believe that Sunshine should have been nominated. Oscar people need some gl***es or somthing almost all these movies were fantastical, espesialy Sunshine.
how about Into The Wild didni't it diserve some nominations besides Hal Holbrock for best supporting actor?

Euphonic distortion and noise levels aside, high-quality analog tape currently outstrips the transparency of all but the best digital recording/playback systems: digital systems can suffer from (among other problems) clock jitter, inferior analog circuitry, inferior digital filter design, improper wordlength conversion, and/or lack of correct dithering. Dramatic improvements in the average quality of digital hardware design are narrowing the gap, though, and might soon eliminate the quality distinction altogether.. [The first prerecorded Reel To Reel Tapes were introduced by RCA Victor Record Co. in 1954.] Reel to reel was still popular through to the end of the 1970s, despite the ubiquitous cassette, mostly because of the superior quality of open reel recordings.

Beyoncé Shuts Down Haters With Flawless A Cappella Version Of The National Anthem
UPDATE: Okay, look. When we first got news that Bey had not been singing the National Anthem live at the inauguration (see below), she was briefly (yes, briefly) dead to us. But it is Beyoncé, and we figured she must have had a good reason for it. So, after playing "Single Ladies" and "Countdown" repeatedly, we dried our tears and moved on.
But, today, Knowles went and brushed her shoulders off, stepped up to the mic, and belted out a fully a cappella version of "The Star-Spangled Banner" in front of a pre-Superbowl media gathering. In one fell swoop, she not only proved she has the pipes, but also helped heal our once-broken hearts. Moreover, she acknowledged that, yes, her fans would rather hear her voice raw and live than perfect and prerecorded (even if she is a perfectionist) and promised that her halftime performance would be 100 percent her. So, thanks, Bey. We're capable of trust and love once again. (Vulture)
Originally published January 22, 2013:
Word just hit that Lady Bey was indeed lip-synching her now infamous rendition of the national anthem. Beyoncé apparently made the last-minute call to use the studio version of the ballad shortly before taking the stage, and the band followed suit with the pre-recorded backup tunes. While we totally get the stresses that can come with serenading the Prez (and hundreds of thousands of onlookers), we have to say we're a bit bummed.
But let's be real here: What can't Beyoncé do? It's not even a full month into the new year and she's landed herself a cover slot on GQ's "100 Sexiest Women of The 21st Century" issue, she's performing at the Super Bowl in a few weeks, her documentary premieres a week after that, and sometime this year she'll drop a new album (eek!). Lip-synched or not, singing "Star-Spangled Banner" at the Presidential Inauguration was one of her biggest milestones yet.

What's the most surprising thing you've discovered about yourself since becoming a mother?
"I'm stronger than I thought."
How has your style changed since you've had kids?
"I've tried to be disciplined about my style since having a baby, as it seems like a slippery slope into comfy mommy-hood! I'm certainly more utilitarian on days, and I've been forced to embrace imperfection more and more (uh, look at my roots!). I also love to wear more flowy, silky, and loose pants now, and I have to wear less aggressive (i.e. dangerous) jewelry for sure."
What's the best advice you've ever gotten from your mother?
"Do what makes you happy."

Reformed Order with Charismatic Ardor: an Interview with Henry Wildeboer.
Recently we asked several of our Reformed Worship readers about their understanding of the Praise and . Worship style and its effect on congregational worship. We wanted to know what questions and concerns they had about the movement. Then we turned to Henry Wildeboer, a pastor involved with this style of worship. We invited him to answer these questions from his experiences in churches in Calgary and Oshawa.

Bridges to Praise: Three Songs in the Praise and Worship Style
For this theme issue we are breaking with the tradition of presenting three hymns for singing in three different months. Rather, in keeping with the style of Praise and Worship music, we include three songs that are presented in a medley fashion. The intention is for the congregation to have access to the words on overheads while the musicians play from the music. The transitions and the accompaniment for "Father, We Love You" were composed by Marie Elzinga.

The Transforming Force of Faith: a Series in the Praise and Worship Style Based on James.
James was the leader of the first Christian church, the church in Jerusalem (Acts 12:17; 13:15). His letter is written out of pastoral concern for the spiritual life of Christ's followers. In a very practical way, he addresses the actions and attitudes of Christians. The book of James is a protest against hypocrisy and a call for the transforming force of faith. The apostle's themes closely follow Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount.

Bathed in Prayer: the Only Way to Prepare and Praise
Pastor," said a young man, barely out of his teens, "don't take this personally, but the most boring thing that we do in our worship services is pray. I really have trouble staying awake—especially during the 'long prayer.'"
This young man's statement bothered me a great deal. He found prayer monotonous. He hinted that he didn't think praying was important. And I knew how damaging his attitude could be.
The Issue You Thought You'd Never See.
Like many of you, the things that I value in worship are deeply colored by my past. I grew up in a rather conservative, traditional church without much liturgical awareness. There was good fellowship and vibrant singing (our organist played at the local roller rink during the week, giving a certain energy and beat to the music when we sang). Fanny Crosby was a staple in our musical diet during worship, and we enjoyed having the minister accompany the congregational singing on his trombone..

BRATTLEBORO -- Members from various planning and development organizations around Windham County on Friday came to the Latchis Theater to visit with Sen. Patrick Leahy at a news conference.
"We work together, we Vermonters," Leahy said, in regard to post Tropical Storm Irene efforts.
On March 15, a day after the start of the Southern Vermont Post-Irene Recovery Project had been announced, attendees shared a few stories about the region during and after Irene. All who spoke expressed thanks for all who helped out since the storm ravaged the area almost 19 months ago.
The Southern Vermont Post-Irene Recovery Project will be funded primarily by a $472,000 grant from the U.S Economic Development Administration, which had been announced in December 2012.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Peter Welch and Leahy "fought to include special one-time EDA disaster funding in the 2011 disaster recovery bill, and then advocated for funding for the Windham Regional Commission and the Bennington County Regional Commission in a letter sent to the EDA Regional Director in June 2012," according to a press release from Leahy.
The Windham Regional Commission and Bennington County Regional Commission will be leading the Post-Irene Recovery Project. The Brattleboro Development Credit Corporation will have a sub-grant, which is being used to bring two Irene Recovery Officers to the area. Both officers were introduced at the news conference.
Anthony
The officers will work with municipalities first in March, then go around and meet the businesses that need help in April. They expect to hear about what businesses are facing difficulties from the municipalities.
"As flood recovery officers, we're going to work on bringing businesses back," said Summers.
After meeting the business owners and developing relationships, he and Woods will then be providing resources necessary for addressing unmet needs.
"The day of the flood, I toured all over Bennington County ... and then I went to Wilmington and was just stunned by the impact that Irene had done to that beautiful, little town," said Woods. "I witnessed the devastation, heard their stories, really, really felt their fears and concerns. And I sort of, at that moment, decided that I was doing to do something and work towards helping them."
During the news conference, it was announced that more than $240,000 will be awarded in grants to businesses in Windham and Windsor Counties that have felt the impact of Irene. These grants will come from the BDCC and Springfield Regional Development Corporation.
"These initial grant funds are the first of three rounds of grant applications and comes from a $1 million disaster (Community Development Block Grant) the state awarded BDCC and SRDC after Leahy, Sanders, Welch and Shumlin helped secure a $21.7 million disaster CDBG allocation from (the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development). BDCC and SRDC applied for the funding to the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development to assist businesses with remaining unmet needs to rebuild their flood affected business," a press release from Leahy said.
Businesses interested in post-Irene help can apply through the by calling the BDCC at 802-257-7731 or the SRDC at 802-885-3061.

Changes made in town pool policies at MHS
By Christian Mysliwiec - Staff Writer
Manchester - posted Thu., Jan. 17, 2013
Earlier this month, state Rep. Stephen Dargan (D-115) of West Haven introduced a bill that would establish a uniform, state-wide policy for pool safety at public schools “so as to reduce the loss of life or injury related to swimming at public schools.” This bill was created in direct response to two tragedies that shook the neighboring towns of East Hartford and Manchester in 2012.
On Jan. 11, 2012, freshman Marcum Asiamah drowned in the East Hartford High School pool during gym class. Acting just over a year after the drowning, the town recently approved a $1.5 million settlement between the board of education and Asiamah's estate. On Nov. 21, 2012, Malvrick Donkor of Manchester High School, who was also a freshman, and, like Asiamah, was originally from Ghana, drowned during his gym class.
The pool at Manchester High School, which is used by the Park & Recreation Department as the town pool, was closed following the accident, as state and local officials investigated the incident. It was reopened for Park & Recreation use on Dec. 19. Kathleen McGuire, recreation supervisor at the Park and Recreation Department, said that there are no changes in policy going forward for the town’s aquatic programs, which include swimming lessons, open swim time, and aquatic exercise classes.
According to McGuire, they have always followed standards set by the aquatic industry, including having certified lifeguards on duty, and employing swim instructors certified by the American Red Cross with several years of experience. “And while we have swimming lessons going on, we have lifeguards in the area, so we're watching the water and instructing,” said McGuire.
Manchester public schools, however, are enacting two changes in policy.
“We've always had a trained lifeguard on duty,” said interim Superintendent of Schools Dr. Richard Kisiel. “But in addition to that, we want one other adult on the pool deck at all times.” In addition, they are requiring that all students pass a swimming test, which the school will keep a record of, before they are allowed in the deep end of the pool.
Additionally, the pool now has a new lifeguard chair, which was installed following an inspection of the pool after Donkor's death by the state Department of Health, which indicated that they wanted the chair installed, said Kisiel.
These policies will be required of all school aquatic programs or classes as well as the Manchester Swim Club, which rents the facility from the school. Should any other organization rent time at the pool, they would be held to the same requirements as well.

This Sunday, the St Albans Food and Drink Festival 2012 drew to a close, as many of our vivacious local food and drink businesses, restaurants, cafés and bars came together during the festival finale. St Albans has never before played host to quite so much street food and general merry-making!
The festival, organised by the St Albans City and District Council for the fifth year now, offered a host of activities over 12 days. Opening on September 26th 2012 with the CAMRA St Albans Beer Festival, foodie-themed celebrations also included a Gourmet Night in aid of local charity Grove House, a Food of Life photography exhibition, a Young Chef of the Year contest, the St Albans Food and Drink Festival Awards ceremony, meal deals and the festival finale itself.
St Albans Food and Drink Festival Awards 2012
On 4th October 2012 our local businesses, restaurants and producers were celebrated at the St Albans Food and Drink Festival Awards held at St Michael’s Manor.
Five of our very best restaurants fought it out to achieve the accolade of Best Local Restaurant. The nominees were L’Italiana, Lussmanns, The Foragers at the Verulam Arms, The Lake at St Michael’s Manor and Veer Dhara with Lussmann’s Fish and Grill retaining the coveted title.
Other local business were also duly highlighted and celebrated; Redbournbury Watermill secured the accolade of Best Local Producer, Mokoko scooped up the Best Bar Award, Ye Olde Fighting Cocks won Best Pub, the Inn on the Park were our Most Family Friendly Venue and Bakehouse St Albans won our Best Local Café award.
Local Gems
Two other young and local entrepreneurs were successful in winning awards, too. The Pudding Stop won Best Local Gem ahead of also being a finalist at this year’s BBC Radio 4 Food and Farming Awards in the category of Best Street Food/Take Away. Good Luck Jonny! Lucy Clark at Heaven is a Cupcake also won the Kate D’Arcy Award for Exceptional Customer Service at the Awards night, too.
Festival Finale
Over forty stallholders took to the streets for the finale on Sunday, offering a warm and friendly welcome to old customers as well as extending an inviting hand to new ones. Starting from one end of town at the foot of our enchanting Cathedral and Abbey of St Albans, newcomers Bakehouse hosted the first Great St Albans Cake-Off, with music and festivities continuing right the way through town along St Peter’s Street.
Also on offer were cupcakes, baked goods and jams, including sweet treats from Dixie’s Cupcakery, Heaven is a Cupcake, The Pudding Stop, St Albans Bakehouse and Sweet Lilly. A particular highlight was the huge wild mushroom stall by Carluccio’s – a festival in itself. On hand to give advice on wine was David Rough from The Hertfordshire Wine School. A little further along, Tony and Dario from local delicatessen Buongiorno Italiana charmed customers with Italian food, whilst restaurateur Andrei Lussman mingled with his customers at his impressive Lussmans Fish and Grill pop-up.
The barbecues and hot plates were sizzling with food including British bangers, Carribbean cuisine, Cypriot, Indian and Italian delicacies. There were also live cookery demonstrations at the theatre throughout the day by local chefs.
All in all, there was definitely a celebratory air to the festival finale, with local businesses showcasing exactly what they have to offer to a discerning and food-loving crowd. It reminded me of how incredibly lucky we are to live in a city where really good food is not only celebrated during the St Albans Food and Drink Festival, but is continually showcased, encouraged and improved upon throughout the whole year, too.

I went along with my family and I agree that the finale was fantastic. I came away with some oreo cupcakes from Heaven is a Cupcake which were delicious! If next year’s festival is at the beginning of October it would have been great to see some local apple and cider producers, given the time of year.
Hi Kirsty, glad you had a lovely time, we were so lucky the weather stayed dry. Ooh Lucy’s cupcakes are yummy. Funnily enough there was an apple festival, at Highfields Park I think but it would ahve made lots more sense to combine it! Hope to go to both next year x
You’ve done a great job of bringing the Festival to life for those of us not lucky enough to be there in person. I wonder if Pudding Stop delivers. Hmm….
Thank you Kellie, I know, Jonny would do a roaring trade by mail order…might mention it to him!!!

The report found that this would increase clean energy capacity by 3 GW by 2016.
It also found that an estimated 650 new green jobs would be created each year through to 2016 in the construction and operation of renewable energy facilities.
The report was conducted by economic consultants Carbon Market Economics at the request of the Clean Energy Council.
The study compared existing and proposed renewable energy policies in Victoria and their potential impact on renewable energy development, in the lead up to the Victorian election on 27 November.
It found the effect of the Victorian Opposition policy on wind farms would be severely detrimental – between 50% and 70% of currently proposed wind farms in Victoria would not be developed if this policy was pursued. Additional expenditure in wind generation would drop by A$2.6-3.6bn from 2010-16.
The Clean Energy Council's CEO Matthew Warren says: "There's no doubt that substantial wind farm investment and jobs will immediately leave Victoria if the Coalition’s current policies were adopted. This could effectively cripple the wind industry."
A recent Newspoll study found that 93% of all Victorians want more renewable energy, contradicting anti wind farm policies.
The report found an estimated 200 fewer jobs would be created from 2010 to 2016 if the Victorian Coalition's policy was adopted.
"The wind farm standards proposed by Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu, including 2 km setbacks, would make it tougher to put up a wind turbine in regional Victoria than to dig a new coal mine.
"The proposed standards are not based on any scientific measure. Victoria has some of the toughest wind farm development standards in the world," Warren says.

So you can see a little more of the detail here, some of the colours and shapes building up gradually.
Since last posting, there’s been paint, wallpaper and more tiling. The wallpaper is so subtle that it wont show up greatly here; I’ll try to remember to take some close ups.
The most daring dash of colour comes on the main wall. I think it really emphasises the space in the apartment:
Currently it’s sanded and the surface has been beautifully prepared for the colour that is to come (a deep flat green).
Here’s a long shot:
And looking back:
Those two ‘mini-walls’ to the side will enclose a floor-to-ceiling cupboard which will be installed between them.
Here’s the study:
The big box is currently housing my bath, although I’ve had to return it as it wasn’t finished properly at the factory. Ho-hum…more delays until the new one arrives…
That piece of wood on top of the box will hold the bathroom sink (see an earlier post for a drawing of how this will look). It cost me the earth and I hope it’s worth it. I’ve just been coating it this weekend for waterproofing, etc.
And speaking of the bathroom, here’s where we’re at:
This is the view from the bedroom into the bathroom:
And finally, the bedroom:
Only a very short amount of time left, or so I’m told…I’ve become used to my contractor’s very loose definition of a deadline.
You’re getting close! Can’t wait to see it all finished!

The tree-lined streets of downtown DeLand are filled with quaint shops and local restaurants. The arts and culture are alive and well in DeLand, as there are many galleries and museums to browse. Downtown DeLand is an award-winning MainStreet community that embraces its past and cherishes the modern amenities that keep the economy moving. DeLand is also home to Stetson University, whose campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
DeLand apartments for rent are ideal for someone seeking a small-own life. DeLand is located halfway between Orlando and Daytona where residents can get a taste of the big-city lifestyle, spend the afternoon on the beach or explore the many parks of Orlando. According to statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, the population has increased greatly over the past 20 years. In 1990, roughly 17,000 residents lived in DeLand, but today more than 27,000 people call the town home.
Living in DeLand, FL
The city of DeLand is situated in east central Florida along the eastern shore of St. John’s River. Although historians know the history of Volusia County dates back some 400 years, the first occupants of DeLand left little trail of their lives. Large mounds of oyster shells, pottery, weapons, domestic tools and bones were the only things found in the area. Some believe the first settler of the area was Ruben Marsh, who moved to the area after the Civil War in 1846.
The area now known as DeLand was previously called Persimmon Hollow because of the abundance of persimmons that grew in the area. In 1876, Henry Addison DeLand traveled with his family to the area filled with towering pine trees and rolling terrain in search of orange groves. Before his first day in the area was over, he purchased more than 159 acres of land. DeLand became very financially secure and helped the community become prosperous, and settlers later voted to name the town after him.
DeLand Work and Study
DeLand is a college town and home of Stetson University, a top-rated university in the south. Founded in 1883, Stetson is Florida’s first private university, first law school and first school to be granted a chapter of Phi Betta Kappa. Today, the school has two campuses and two satellite locations. Students looking for rentals in DeLand can also attend the city’s campus of Daytona State College.
In Volusia County, there are plenty of opportunities for employment. The manufacturing industry is very alive and well in the area and provides jobs for many. The headquarters for NASCAR/International Speedway Corporation are also nearby. Other top employers include Halifax Health, Stonewood Holdings and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
Rentals in DeLand, FL and Cost of Living
Living in DeLand is fairly inexpensive, especially when considering the amount of amenities at residents’ fingertips. According to Best Places, the overall cost of living is 10 points lower than the national average, food is 6 points higher and utilities are 10 points lower. However, the average commute is four minutes less than the national average.
According to statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, the average cost of rentals in DeLand is $833.
DeLand Attractions and Special Events
DeLand is a music city with annual music festivals around town. The DeLand Original Music Festival began in 2000 and is considered the largest independent music festival in the Southeast. The festival hosts more than 200 acts on six different stages in the historic downtown center.

OBAMA CHANNEL And iPhone Application
I am not sure you guys know this but Obama has leased a broadcasting channel on DishNetwork channel 73. Due to run until November 4th. It plays his Plan for America Ad and the ad they had from the convention. If you have Dish and you flip through the local guide you will see the channel called OBAMA. How cool is that. I do hope however they plan to ad more commercials and maybe some rallies and things of that nature.
Also they have launched the free iphone application so that supporters can keep up to date with the lastest news, and help with voter registration and other nifty stuff.
This man and his operatives are friggin geniuses in my honest opinion.
They
But McCain invented...
Really, someone was bound to post it. Might as well be me.
and of course I have been reading a lot of McCain supporters complaining about it. Saying they will discontinue Dish, and saying it is a dumb idea and a waiste of money. For some reason I doubt they would feel the same if McNoOriginalIdea was the one he did it first.

Effect of P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux on cerebrospinal fluid concentrations in rhesus monkeys.
ABSTRACT Brain penetration of drugs which are subject to P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated efflux is attenuated, as manifested by the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid concentration (C(CSF)), a good surrogate of the unbound brain concentration (C(ub)), is lower than the unbound plasma concentration (C(up)) for Pgp substrates. In rodents, the attenuation magnitude of brain penetration by Pgp-mediated efflux has been estimated by correlating the ratio of CSF to plasma exposures (C(CSF)/C(p)) with the unbound fraction in plasma (f(u)) upon the incorporation of the in vivo or in vitro Pgp-mediated efflux ratios (ERs). In the present work, we investigated the impact of Pgp-mediated efflux on C(CSF) in monkeys. Following intravenous administration to cisterna magna ported rhesus monkeys, the CSF and plasma concentrations were determined for 25 compounds from three discovery programs. We also evaluated their f(u) in rhesus plasma and ER in human and African green monkey MDR-transfected LLC-PK1 cells. These compounds varied significantly in the f(u) (0.025-0.73), and 24 out of 25 are considered Pgp substrates based on their appreciable directional transport (ER>2). The C(CSF)/C(p) was significantly lower than the corresponding f(u) (>or=3-fold) for 16 compounds regardless of a significant correlation (R(2)=0.59, p=4 x 10(-5)) when the C(CSF)/C(p) was plotted against the f(u). When the f(u) was normalized to the ER (f(u)/ER) the correlation was improved (R(2)=0.75, p=8 x 10(-8)). More importantly, only one compound showed the C(CSF)/C(p) that exceeded 3-fold of the normalized f(u). The results suggest that the impact of Pgp-mediated efflux in monkeys, similar to the case in rodents, is reasonably reflected by the gradient between the free concentrations in plasma and in CSF. Therefore, f(u) and Pgp ER may serve as useful measurements in estimating in vivo C(CSF)/C(p) ratios in monkeys, and potentially in humans.

Article: MS Data Miner: A web-based software tool to analyze, compare, and share mass spectrometry protein identifications.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: Data processing and analysis of proteomics data are challenging and time consuming. In this paper, we present MS Data Miner (MDM) (), a freely available web-based software solution aimed at minimizing the time required for the analysis, validation, data comparison, and presentation of data files generated in MS software, including Mascot (Matrix Science), Mascot Distiller (Matrix Science), and ProteinPilot (AB Sciex). The program was developed to significantly decrease the time required to process large proteomic data sets for publication. This open sourced system includes a spectra validation system and an automatic screenshot generation tool for Mascot-assigned spectra. In addition, a Gene Ontology term analysis function and a tool for generating comparative Excel data reports are included. We illustrate the benefits of MDM during a proteomics study comprised of more than 200 LC-MS/MS analyses recorded on an AB Sciex TripleTOF 5600, identifying more than 3000 unique proteins and 3.5 million peptides.Proteomics 07/2012; 12(18):2792-6. · 4.43 Impact Factor
Article: Human inter-α-inhibitor is a substrate for factor XIIIa and tissue transglutaminase.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: findings suggest that transglutaminases catalyze the covalent conjugation of inter-α-inhibitor to other proteins. This was demonstrated by the cross-linking between inter-α-inhibitor and fibrinogen by either factor XIIIa or tissue transglutaminase. Finally, using quantitative mass spectrometry, we show that inter-α-inhibitor is cross-linked to the fibrin clot in a 1:20 ratio relative to the known factor XIIIa substrate α2-antiplasmin. This interaction may protect fibrin or other Lys-donating proteins from adventitious proteolysis by increasing the local concentration of bikunin. In addition, the reaction may influence the TSG-6/heavy Chain 2-mediated transfer of heavy chains observed during inflammation.Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 09/2011; 1814(12):1624-30. · 4.66 Impact Factor

Article: Potential clinical importance of the activation peptide of prostate-specific antigen.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is currently the best marker available for screening and monitoring disease recurrence, but its use has limitations. This study investigates the biosynthesis, secretion and activation of PSA in a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line. PSA is secreted as a pro-enzyme containing a seven amino acid activation peptide (APLILSR). Because the activation peptide is removed extracellularly in vivo, we hypothesized that it may be detected in the blood or urine. Activated PSA is a serine protease and reacts rapidly with protease inhibitors in the blood. These protein complexes are removed from the circulatory system by hepatocyte-mediated endocytosis. This rapid clearance likely interferes with detection of PSA in the early stages of prostate cancer. Notably these clearance mechanisms are not considered when PSA levels are determined clinically. We used radio-labeled proteins to determine the clearance of PSA in complex with its inhibitors as well as in vivo clearance of APLILSR. Dot blotting was used to determine the presence of APLILSR in human urine samples. Our data indicates that PSA-alpha1-antichymotrypsin only accumulates in the blood when large amounts of PSA are present and saturate clearance mechanisms. We found that APLILSR is filtered from the bloodstream by the kidney, and is detectable in the urine of patients with prostate cancer, but not controls. We propose that urine detection of the PSA activation peptide may represent a clinically sensitive measure of PSA production/secretion.International journal of clinical and experimental pathology 02/2009; 2(6):588-98. · 1.89 Impact Factor
Article: Transfer of inter-alpha-inhibitor heavy chains to hyaluronan by surface-linked hyaluronan-TSG-6 complexes.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: Inter-alpha-inhibitor, TSG-6, and hyaluronan have important functions in fertility and inflammation. Two subunits of inter-alpha-inhibitor, the heavy chains, form covalent bonds with TSG-6 or hyaluronan in vitro. TSG-6-heavy chain complexes serve as intermediates in the transfer of heavy chains from inter-alpha-inhibitor to hyaluronan. In vivo, in addition to these complexes, stable ternary complexes of hyaluronan with both TSG-6 and heavy chains have been demonstrated in the ovulatory cumulus oophorus. In our ongoing efforts to characterize the multiple interactions between hyaluronan, TSG-6 and inter-alpha-inhibitor, we recently characterized the formation of highly stable complexes of TSG-6 with hyaluronan that had been tethered to a solid surface. Here we show that these hyaluronan-TSG-6 complexes are functionally active and transfer heavy chain subunits from inter-alpha-inhibitor to either free or surface-bound hyaluronan. Transitional hyaluronan-TSG-6-heavy chain complexes do not accumulate in vitro. Our data show the capability for heavy chain transfer by both free TSG-6 and preformed hyaluronan-TSG-6 complexes, suggesting that both might contribute to hyaluronan modification in vivo. Transfer of heavy chains to surface-tethered hyaluronan by either free TSG-6 or surface-tethered hyaluronan-TSG-6 complexes did not affect the CD 44-mediated binding of BW 5147 cells in vitro. We show how TSG-6 and hyaluronan together can deplete inter-alpha-inhibitor and generate bikunin, as has been observed in sepsis, and discuss the role of TSG-6 in the generation of hyaluronan-heavy chain complexes associated with ovulation, arthritis, and sepsis.Journal of Biological Chemistry 12/2008; 284(4):2320-31. · 4.77 Impact Factor
Article: TSG-6 transfers proteins between glycosaminoglycans via a Ser28-mediated covalent catalytic mechanism.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: Studies of the interaction between Bikunin proteins, tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6), and glycosaminoglycans have revealed a unique catalytic activity where TSG-6/heavy chain 2 transfer heavy chain subunits between glycosaminoglycan chains. The activity is mediated by TSG-6/heavy chain 2 and involves a transient SDS stable interaction between TSG-6 and the heavy chain to be transferred. The focus of this study was to characterize the molecular structure of this cross-link to gain further insight into the catalytic mechanism. The result showed that the C-terminal Asp residue of the heavy chains forms an ester bond to Ser(28) beta-carbon of TSG-6 suggesting that this residue plays a role during catalysis.Journal of Biological Chemistry 10/2008; 283(49):33919-26. · 4.77 Impact Factor
Article: The transfer of heavy chains from bikunin proteins to hyaluronan requires both TSG-6 and HC2.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6) is involved in the transfer of heavy chains (HCs) from inter-alpha-inhibitor (IalphaI), pre-alpha-inhibitor, and as shown here HC2.bikunin to hyaluronan through the formation of covalent HC.TSG-6 intermediates. In contrast to IalphaI and HC2.bikunin, pre-alpha-inhibitor does not form a covalent complex in vitro using purified proteins but needs the presence of another factor (Rugg, M. S., Willis, A. C., Mukhopadhyay, D., Hascall, V. C., Fries, E., Fülöp, C., Milner, C. M., and Day, A. J. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 25674-25686). In the present study we purified the required component from human plasma and identified it as HC2. Proteins containing HC2 including IalphaI, HC2.bikunin, and free HC2 promoted the formation of HC3.TSG-6 and subsequently HC3.hyaluronan complexes. HC1 or HC3 did not possess this activity. The presented data reveal that both HC2 and TSG-6 are required for the transesterification reactions to occur.Journal of Biological Chemistry 08/2008; 283(27):18530-7. · 4.77 Impact Factor
Article: Evidence for a two-step mechanism involved in the formation of covalent HC x TSG-6 complexes.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: IalphaI and TSG-6 interact to form a covalent bond between the C-terminal Asp alpha-carbon of an IalphaI heavy chain (HC) and an unknown component of TSG-6. This event disrupts the protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein (PGP) cross-link and dissociates IalphaI. In simple terms the interaction involves 5 components: (i) the IalphaI HCs, (ii) bikunin, (iii) chondroitin sulfate chain, (iv) TSG-6, and (v) divalent cations. To understand the molecular mechanism of complex formation, the effect of these were separately examined. The data show that although the mature covalent cross-link between the HCs and TSG-6 only involves the C-terminal Asp residue, the native fold of both IalphaI and TSG-6 was essential for the reaction to occur. Similarly, complex formation was prevented if the chondroitin sulfate chain was cleaved, releasing bikunin but maintaining the HC1 and HC2 PGP cross-links. In contrast, releasing the majority of the bikunin protein moiety by limited proteolysis did not prevent complex formation. An analysis of the divalent-cation requirements revealed two distinct interactions between IalphaI and TSG-6: (i) a noncovalent manganese, magnesium, or calcium-independent interaction between TSG-6 and the chondroitin sulfate chain (Kd 180 nM) and (ii) a covalent manganese, magnesium, or calcium-dependent interaction generating HC1 x TSG-6, HC2 x TSG-6, and high molecular weight (HMW) IalphaI. Significantly, both free TSG-6 and HC x TSG-6 complexes were able to bind the chondroitin sulfate chain suggesting that the sites on TSG-6 were distinct. On the basis of these findings, we propose a two-step reaction mechanism involving two putative binding sites. Initially, a cation-independent interaction between TSG-6 and the chondroitin sulfate chain is formed at site 1. Subsequently, a cation-dependent transesterification occurs, generating the covalent HC x TSG-6 cross-link at another site, site 2.Biochemistry 07/2006; 45(24):7661-8. · 3.42 Impact Factor
Article: The TSG-6 and I alpha I interaction promotes a transesterification cleaving the protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein (PGP) cross-link.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: During co-incubation of human inter-alpha-inhibitor (IalphaI) and human tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 protein (TSG-6) SDS-stable interactions are formed between the two proteins. We have analyzed the products of this reaction and characterized the mechanism of complex formation. Following the incubation seven new bands not previously identified were apparent in SDS-PAGE. Three of these bands did not contain TSG-6, including heavy chain (HC)1.bikunin, HC2.bikunin, and free bikunin. In addition high molecular weight complexes composed of the same components as I alpha I, including HC1, HC2, and bikunin, were formed. The formation of these complexes was prevented by the addition of hyaluronan. The cross-links stabilizing these complexes displaying properties similar to the protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein (PGP) cross-link. The TSG-6-containing SDS-stable complexes were composed of HC1.TSG-6 or HC2.TSG-6 exclusively. Both glycosylated and non-glycosylated TSG-6 participated in the complex formation. The HC.TSG-6 cross-links were different from the PGP cross-link and were determined to be ester bonds between the alpha-carbonyl of the C-terminal Asp of the heavy chain and most likely a hydroxyl group containing the TSG-6 residue. The mechanism involved cleaving the PGP cross-link of I alpha I during a transesterification reaction. A TSG-6 hydroxyl group reacts with the ester bond between the alpha-carbonyl of the C-terminal Asp residues of HC1 or HC2 and carbon-6 of an internal N-acetylgalactosamine of the chondroitin-4-sulfate chain. An intermediate is formed resulting in a partitioning of the reaction between HC(1 or 2).TSG-6 complexes and transfer of HC(1 or 2) to the chondroitin via competing pathways.Journal of Biological Chemistry 04/2005; 280(12):11936-42. · 4.77 Impact Factor

Article: Feasibility and changes in symptoms and functioning following inpatient cancer rehabilitation.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: Abstract Aim. The aim was to assess feasibility of a 3 + 1 week inpatient rehabilitation program for cancer survivors, to explore characteristics of the attending participants and examine changes in work status, symptoms and functioning, level of fatigue, exercise and physical performance following rehabilitation. Methods. This was an open intervention study involving cancer survivors having completed primary cancer treatment. The multidisiplinary program consisted of physical training, patient education and group sessions. Participant were assessed at primary stay (T0), at follow-up stay 8-12 weeks later (T1), and six months after T1 (T2). Symptoms and functioning were assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment Core Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, physical fatigue by Fatigue Questionnaire, physical exercise by The Nord- Trøndelag Health Study Physical Activity Questionnaire and physical performance by aerobic capacity (VO(2max)), 30 second Sit-to-stand (STS) and Maximum Step Length (MSL). Linear mixed models were used in analyses. Results. One hundred and thirty-four of 163 included participants (82%) completed both rehabilitation stays and returned questionaires at T2. The majority of completers were females (81%), breast cancer survivors (60%), highly educated and with mean age of 52.8 years (SD of 8.1). Participants had higher level of symptoms and fatigue and lower functioning at admission compared to a Norwegian reference population. However, they reported higher physical exercise level and 47% reported improved work status from T0 to T2. Symptoms and functioning, fatigue, physical exercise and physical performance improved significantly from T0 to T1 and were maintained at T2. Conclusions. The rehabilitation program was feasible and symptoms and functioning normalized following rehabilitation. The program mainly recruited well-educated breast cancer survivors, reporting relative high level of physical exercise. More focus should be put on recruiting and selecting those who need comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation and also compare the effects of inpatient with outpatient rehabilitation programs.Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden) 07/2012; 51(8):1070-80. · 2.27 Impact Factor
Article: Measurement of physical activity in cancer survivors-a comparison of the HUNT 1 Physical Activity Questionnaire (HUNT 1 PA-Q) with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and aerobic capacity.[show abstract] [hide abstract]
ABSTRACT: PURPOSE: Physical activity (PA) is an important adjuvant component in all phases of the cancer disease and PA is important for better functioning, coping with the situation and overall quality of life (QoL). In order to achieve better scientific knowledge of the effect of PA in cancer survivors, it is of paramount importance to have validated and feasible assessment tools for PA. METHODS: This validation study, which was part of an open intervention study, used a cross-sectional and a longitudinal design. The HUNT 1 physical activity questionnaire (HUNT 1 PA-Q) was compared to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and aerobic capacity. The participants were cancer survivors with different diagnoses attending an inpatient rehabilitation program partly focusing on physical training. RESULTS: The correlations between HUNT 1 PA-Q and IPAQ were 0.41 at pre-test and 0.57 at post-test, and sensitivity to change (effect size) was 0.42 for both questionnaires. VO(2max) demonstrated high sensitivity to change (0.68) and low correlations with HUNT 1 PA-Q (0.30 at pre-test and 0.21 at post-test). There were 13 incomplete HUNT 1 PA-Q forms and 48 incomplete IPAQ forms during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: HUNT 1 PA-Q is considered suitable for use in cancer survivors and should be preferred to IPAQ because it was easier to fill in and provided more complete data. Aerobic capacity measures other aspect of PA and should be used as a supplement to PA questionnaire when the aim is to capture health effects related to aerobic capacity.Supportive Care in Cancer 07/2012; · 2.09 Impact Factor

DIGITAL DIVIDE
Training increases HINARI and AGORA benefits
More than 100 publishers have opened up their online subscription journals to researchers in the world's poorest countries. But using information isn't easy if the users have no experience of such resources. Siân Harris finds out how training is helping
Research Information: June/July 2007
What do librarians do when they retire? There must be nearly as many answers for this as there are librarians, but Lenny Rhine’s retirement activity has to score pretty highly on the list of interesting responses.
Since taking early retirement from the University of Florida, Rhine has been spending much of his time travelling the world. He’s not in search of a great sun tan, though; his aim is to train librarians in the developing world in how to use digital resources.
In 2002, medical staff and researchers in the world’s poorest countries began to have access to the latest cutting-edge research thanks to the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) HINARI (Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative) programme [1]. Through this, around 100 biomedical publishers – from the giants with hundreds of journals to small society publishers with one or two titles – opened up electronic access to their products to those who cannot afford to subscribe to any journals. This resource currently gives access to around 3,750 biomedical journals, which would be equivalent to around £1.5 m per year in subscription costs. This gives trainee doctors in Sierra Leone, for example, access to the same range of resources as their counterparts in Oxford University or Harvard. Such resources have the potential to transform clinical practice, medical training and research in such countries, and 2,500 institutions in the developing world have so far signed up to access these resources.
However, there is a challenge: until recently many institutions in the developing world have been relying on 20 or 30 year old books for their research and teaching and have little or no experience of using the internet. This is where Rhine comes in. He runs training courses to teach medical librarians and health workers how to use the massive array of resources that have now become available to them. ‘They have gone from nothing to almost too much, so we spend a lot of time teaching search skills,’ he commented.
Rhine started doing workshops in the developing world in 1997, while still working as a medical librarian at the University of Florida. ‘It started off about health information on the internet,’ he explained. This led to his involvement with HINARI as these resources became available. He worked with the WHO to develop the original training modules and is now in the process of updating them. ‘Being retired now means I have time to work on this. I have hours to spend updating the training modules,’ he pointed out.
Lenny Rhine has recently returned from training medical libraries and other staff in Vietnam
Training material needs regular updating because, for example, when publishers’ websites and databases are redesigned, the screenshots and guidelines on how to navigate these sites must be changed and then the updated versions translated into several languages. Rhine’s aim is to ensure that at least the English versions of these training materials are up-to-date.
This training material forms the basis of eight training workshops that Rhine is running this year in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as an email course for those who cannot attend one of these workshops. Funding for this comes from Elsevier, which has given a grant of $80,000 this year through its ‘Libraries Without Borders’ partnership with the Medical Libraries Association. Half of this money will be spent on health-based training, to train HINARI users and half will be spent training users of a sister initiative, AGORA [2], which provides agricultural information (see box below).
‘Lenny has been training in Africa as long as I’ve known him. He knows everybody and knows where the need is. We thought we could do more to help,’ explained Tony McSean, Elsevier’s director of library relations. ‘Rather than do it by ourselves as an Elsevier initiative, we thought we’d team up with the Medical Library Association and give them the money to coordinate the training activities that Lenny does.’
McSean and his colleagues at Elsevier have been very impressed with Rhine’s training courses. ‘It’s amazing value for money. Because Lenny is doing it there’s not a penny wasted. He’s not a man to take a taxi if there’s a bus running. It works out at about $10,000 per trip, which includes all the flights, materials and everything. It is an extraordinarily good thing,’ said McSean.
Course content
So what do Rhine’s courses cover? Firstly, there is how to use the internet and to search for resources. As well as the resources included in HINARI there are open-access journals and also preprints in databases such as PubMed Central. ‘I see people interested in whatever way they can get the full text,’ he said. ‘When we teach PubMed, we teach them how to do keyword searches to get all HINARI and open-access papers.’ Links to open-access journals are also provided from the search pages of HINARI and its sister sites.
A second aspect of the training is showing people what their institution’s HINARI licence permits them to do. ‘One of the most fascinating dynamics is explaining how you can and can’t use HINARI,’ said Rhine. ‘For example, you can’t download or print complete journals. You can print out and include material in courses. You can also charge for printing costs but must not charge for the material itself.’
He also observed differences in attitudes about the institutional passwords that are required for access to HINARI. These are intended to be used by all members and guests of a registered institution. However, he said, ‘sometimes librarians guard the passwords and don’t give them out, whereas others are too liberal in giving them to all their friends.’
Such attitudes about passwords were also observed in a recent study about awareness and access to free resources published in the journal BMC Health Services Research [3]. The study interviewed over 300 researchers and medical students in five African countries and reported that librarians sometimes limit access to passwords. The study also revealed that while 90 per cent of respondents had heard of PubMed, only 47 per cent had heard of HINARI. The authors of the paper concluded that awareness of free-access initiatives is limited.
This finding highlights another important goal of Rhine’s training courses. ‘We also need to teach librarians about marketing. They need to learn not just how to use HINARI but how to promote it, by, for example, going to faculty members and telling them they need to teach students about online information and put it in their courses,’ he said. ‘Staff are giving the same lectures as they were 20 years ago because they have had no access to new information. We have to talk to people about how to integrate new information into the curriculum.’ As Elizeus Rutebemberwa of the Institute of Public Health, Uganda, commented, ‘I am enjoying the exercises and I am sharing the skills with my students.’
The latest updated course material that Rhine is now working on includes a new component too: information about publishing skills, which he anticipates could also be useful to other programmes. This element of the course includes, for example, how to submit papers to journals, how to identify good journals, other resources on the web and case studies.
Elsevier’s McSean agrees with the importance of this area. ‘One of the side benefits that we hope to see from HINARI is an increase in authorship from the developing world. We are already starting to see new research that probably wouldn’t have taken place without resources like HINARI,’ he commented. ‘It’s a long-term good: the more working scientists become used to high-quality research the better their research and the more they’ll want to publish.’
Mohamed Jalloh of Senegal believes that this aim is successful: ‘There is no doubt that I will be more efficient in using HINARI after completing this training. HINARI has helped me a lot in the few publications I have done with my colleagues. Thank you for helping.’
Bandwidth issues
Despite the impact of opening up access to HINARI and its sister sites and the training in how to use the resources, there are still big challenges. The research resources may be the same as those available at leading developed world institutions but the computers and bandwidth are generally very different. ‘In some areas, especially in Africa, it can take an hour to download a PDF,’ pointed out Rhine.
McSean added that delegates at a recent conference in Africa reported working at night or even hiring dedicated staff to work night shifts in order to use the most available bandwidth to access HINARI.
Nonetheless, things are improving, according to Rhine and McSean. Rhine described how a radiologist in Tanzania attended one of the training courses and then wrote a grant proposal to get the necessary bandwidth and computers for his library. And McSean commented: ‘We’ve discovered that once you’ve got deans of faculties who’ve been trained to use HINARI they will find the broadband access. In one African university, for example, a faculty member paid for the broadband access himself out of his earnings from his private practice. That’s one of the things we are hoping to achieve.’
So, what’s next? Elsevier’s training grant lasts until the end of this year. ‘We hope that it continues or another publisher wants to get involved and continue it,’ said Rhine. ‘It’s very rewarding to teach bright people and help to bridge the information gap. I’m motivated all the time.’

HINARI, AGORA and OARE - the basics
The World Health Organization’s HINARI (Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative) project launched in January 2002 with around 1,500 journals from six major publishers: Blackwell, Elsevier Science, the Harcourt Worldwide STM Group, Wolters Kluwer International Health & Science, Springer Verlag and John Wiley.
‘HINARI doesn’t cost a lot of money and it’s extremely publisher friendly. We simply open up our existing services to people who couldn’t pay for them and would never have the money to pay for them. We are not losing any business,’ said Elsevier’s Tony McSean. ‘It is a wonderful match with all our stakeholders. The authors that know about it think it’s a wonderful idea. HINARI is by far my most favourite thing that I do at Elsevier.’. Some large, emerging countries such as India and China are excluded by most publishers as these markets represent important parts of many publishers’ business plans. The HINARI programme has recently been reviewed and the publishers involved have committed to continuing with it until at least 2015.
Following on from the launch of HINARI, two further initiatives, AGORA and OARE, have been launched. These work on similar principles and use the same World Bank figures to determine eligibility.
AGORA (Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture) was launched in October 2003 and is administered by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The system provides access to over 900 key journals in food, nutrition, agriculture and related biological, environmental and social sciences. The founding publishers were Blackwell Publishing, CABI Publishing, Elsevier, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Nature Publishing Group, Oxford University Press, Springer-Verlag, and John Wiley & Sons and they have now been joined by more than 30 other publishers.
The youngest of the three sister initiatives is OARE (Online Access to Research in the Environment) [4], which launched in October 2006 and is coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Yale University, and leading science and technology publishers. It enables developing countries to gain free access to one of the world’s largest collections of environmental science literature: more than 1,000 journals from over 200 publishers.

The Politicisation of Community Restorative Justice in Northern Ireland
Moving away from violent conflict, where severe punitiveness characterised people’s response to norm transgression, towards a strong, peaceful, inclusive and democratic community requires an enormous mind shift for many people. Practitioners of community-based restorative justice in Northern Ireland refer to this as an ‘education process’. The development and affirmation of new social norms can be facilitated through participatory practices such as community-based restorative justice. As such, these can be an important feature in a transitional society, particularly considering that many of these projects are located in communities which have a strained, or even non-existent relationship with the police.
There are two groups of community-based restorative justice initiatives in Northern Ireland: there is Community Restorative Justice Ireland (CRJI) which operates in 14 Republican communities across the north, and Northern Ireland Alternatives (NIA) which has offices in four Loyalist areas in and around Belfast. Both projects were initiated by political ex-prisoners, who still play a valuable role, together with other committed members from the local community who assist in the day-to-day operation of these projects. Both CRJI and NIA use restorative justice principles for their practice, and even though the focus of their work differs somewhat, both have in common that they were set up as a non-violent alternative to the practices of punishment violence as practiced by the different paramilitary groups in their respective communities.
Today, the majority of CRJI’s case-load is concerned with neighbour disputes and youth related issues such as drinking on street corners and playing football in the street. However, neighbour disputes in these areas have a tendency to escalate and are often based on generations of grievances, which means the disputes often become very violent. CRJI are also introducing restorative justice into some of the local schools, and working with reintegration of both young people coming out of prison and of people who have previously been excluded from the community by paramilitaries.
NIA works by a slightly different model, focusing mainly on intensive youth work, attempting to divert young people from a life of crime, involvement in paramilitary groups, and punishment by those groups. They also have an active victims' component, which includes support, a listening ear, victim-offender mediation etc. The impact of such a service should not be underestimated in a community where victims of crime were not adverse to using paramilitaries for the dispensing of ‘justice’2.
The levels of crime and anti-social behaviour in these communities are high, and on the increase. The transition (the period after the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998) has resulted in people losing their sense of being part of a larger community, of a common purpose and of being responsible to each other. Community-based restorative justice has a potentially important role to play here, in terms of bridging gaps between community and state, empowering communities and individuals, and increasing tolerance and respect in a fragmented and fast-changing environment. Moreover, community-based restorative justice projects in Northern Ireland do not just influence the ‘ordinary’ community in the above-mentioned ways. They also have an influence on paramilitary groups, both mainstream and dissident, and so-called vigilante groups, challenging the leadership in particular, to think differently about conflict resolution.
The politicisation of community restorative justice.
The current debate surrounding community restorative justice in Northern Ireland has been mainly focused on the projects in Republican communities, and whether they intend to work with the PSNI (Police Service Northern Ireland), and if so, what form such cooperation would take. Politicians on both sides of the divide have voiced much concern in relation to this. However, significantly less attention has been paid to NIA, presumably because they have police sitting on their management committee and they are actively seeking to develop working partnerships with relevant statutory agencies.
Both CRJI and NIA are currently seeking funding from the government to be able to continue their work, which has spurred a debate, spearheaded by some of the major political parties, characterised by verbal mud-throwing on a playing field where community restorative justice is being used as a political football. The formulation and publication of the draft protocols which aim to regulate the relationship between community restorative justice projects in both Loyalist and Republican communities and the state, have attracted much attention from political parties of all persuasions. I is understood that government funding would provide CRJI and Alternatives with official legitimacy, a legitimacy which many people feel is underserved or, as expressed by some political parties, outright dangerous.
The main reason for this unease is that community restorative justice in Northern Ireland, especially on the Republican side, is perceived as being closely associated with parts of the wider Republican Movement, in particular the Provisional IRA and their main political party, Sinn Fein.
This has resulted in an intense politicisation of restorative justice which is not necessarily a positive development. A working partnership between community restorative justice on both sides of the divide and statutory agencies is important for the future practice of these projects. However, if such a partnership is forged at the expense of community ownership, then we need to think very carefully about the next step.
Partnerships based on communal objectives, formation of community support, and the enhancement of community resources, are all vital in the development of ‘good practice’ regarding cooperation between state and community, made more urgent due to the transition which Northern Ireland is currently undergoing.
Much of the important work done by NIA and its Republican counterpart CRJI - work which has received much attention and acclaim amongst the international restorative justice community of academics and practitioners – can potentially be undermined and their community ethos diluted, due to the politicisation of restorative justice here. And if that happens, we run the risk of losing an opportunity for positive and genuine change in the way in which justice is administered and delivered in Northern Ireland.

2 Paramilitary ‘justice’ in this instance refers to practices utilised by both Republican and Loyalist paramilitary groupings which involved the beating (with baseball bats, clubs, sticks) and shootings (in arms, knees, feet, or a combination), as ‘punishment’ for involvement in antisocial behaviour, the selling of drugs, or collaboration with state forces for example. Such practices continued unabated after the signing of the Peace Agreement, but have decreased substantially in the last 2 years, much thanks to the work by community restorative justice programmes.

PURCHASE, N.Y. - A report released Monday by MasterCard Advisors said that retail sales through the second week of December generally continued November’s momentum, with several sectors recording moderate to strong gains.
MasterCard SpendingPulse reports on national retail and services sales and is based on aggregate sales activity in the MasterCard payments network, coupled with survey-based estimates for all other payment forms, including cash and check.
“The modest growth we first saw with the August Back-to-School season has accelerated,” said Michael McNamara, VP MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. “These results suggest that retail spending continues to gain traction. Most sectors showed steady improvements, McNamara added, though electronics, department stores and furnishings categories recorded flat to small declines.
SpendingPulse analyzed the electronics, apparel, e-commerce and luxury sectors. It found that e-commerce continues to be one of the stars of the season with a season-to-date growth rate of 13.5%. The sector has been showing double-digit weekly year-over-year growth rates since the second week in November.
The total apparel category was up 9.8% for the season-to-date. Women’s apparel sales were up 4.4% for the season with the category recording a slightly better showing since Black Friday. Men’s apparel sales grew 8.4% year-over-year. Growth within the teen and family apparel segments also is strong, according to the report.

Exclusive: China's fraud-hit Suntech strikes more trouble in Italy
BRINDISI, Italy |
BRINDISI, Italy (Reuters) - An Italian court has filed criminal charges against an investment fund controlled by China's Suntech Power Holdings, the world's largest maker of solar panels, accusing it of illegally building solar farms to milk state subsidies.
The charges, together with other legal actions still being prepared against the fund, could eventually result in 80 million euros' ($100 million) worth of subsidy-backed solar farms being dismantled, an Italian prosecutor said, extending the problems of Suntech's Global Solar Fund (GSF), which invests in European solar power projects.
The charges and pending litigation have not been disclosed by U.S.-listed Suntech (STP.N), whose problems in Italy appear to go well beyond the limited statements it has so far made in official filings.
Suntech has lost more than 40 percent of its market value since July 30, and is being sued by several U.S. law firms on behalf of shareholders, after revealing that a GSF shareholder and executive, Javier Romero, had used $700 million in fake German bonds to help guarantee some of the fund's financing.
The class-action lawsuits say Suntech, which owns 80 percent of the fund, failed to properly disclose the financial workings of GSF and to monitor its business practices.
The Italian charges add to questions over the Luxembourg-based fund's affairs, the extent to which Suntech supervised it, and how much shareholders were told about the scale of its troubles in Italy.
Suntech is also scrambling to find new financing to cover a convertible bond due early next year at a time when the entire solar industry is in the middle of a slump.
"Suntech management had the opportunity to disclose all potential problems associated with GSF when they announced the suspected fraud with the German bonds," said Mark Bachman, a solar technologies analyst for Avian Securities in Boston.
"If there are now additional potential liabilities related to GSF activities in Italy that were undisclosed, then what little investor interest remained in the stock will be eroded."
A prosecutor in the southern Italian city of Brindisi has formally charged five of the fund's subsidiaries with illegal construction of solar power plants, accusing them of sidestepping the approval process in order to exploit Italy's generous renewable-energy subsidies.
The charges are that GSF subsidiaries failed to obtain the correct permit to build solar plants of more than 1 MW by splitting each park up into several smaller units that qualified for a less rigorous and faster permitting process.
In some cases, the GSF subsidiaries prematurely announced completion of construction on the plants in order to meet a deadline needed to qualify for incentives, court documents show.
The trial involving these five solar plants is set to begin on December 6.
Another 11 of the companies controlled by the fund are under investigation, and charges will be sought against them, said Nicolangelo Ghizzardi, the prosecutor handling the cases.
Suntech's chief technology officer, Stuart Wenham, who was appointed by Suntech to help oversee the work of the fund, declined to comment for this story and referred questions to Suntech's executive chairman, Zhengrong Shi, who also has an individual 10.7 percent stake in the Global Solar Fund.
Shi's office said he was travelling and could not immediately respond to emailed questions. He said in a statement on August 14 that "the solar plants owned and operated by the fund's operating companies are in good order".
In reply to questions for this story, Suntech said it was reviewing the GSF portfolio and that it expected a "positive outcome" from the proceedings, and GSF denied any wrongdoing.
Together, the charges and investigations apply to solar plants that produce more than 20 MW of power and cost at least 80 million euros to build, according to an estimate by an engineer consulted by the court.
"If convicted, the demolition order is obligatory and issued automatically by the judge," Ghizzardi said in his office in Brindisi, a city in the sundrenched Puglia region at the "heel" of Italy.
The number of GSF-owned companies that are already charged or under investigation could rise, said a Puglia judicial source who spoke on condition of anonymity because the probes are still protected by confidentiality rules.
Suntech's only filing on the issue was in May last year, when it noted in its 2010 annual report that solar parks belonging to five of the fund's investee companies and totalling 2.83 MW were under investigation by the court of Brindisi.
In Suntech's 2011 annual report, filed in April this year, the firm gave no update on the situation, though Ghizzardi had already asked for a trial by the end of February. On June 26, a judge confirmed the charges and ordered the trial to begin in December.
SUNTECH KNEW
In a May 2011 disclosure, the firm said a "negative sentence" relating to the 2.83 MW would cost it about 9.6 million euros. Using the same valuation basis, an adverse finding on 20 MW of solar capacity would cost around 68 million euros.
A Suntech spokesman said the company had been assured that GSF "acted in compliance with the local regulations, that it has received legal advice on this matter, and that it expects a positive outcome from the proceedings".
GSF said it had acted within the law, and that the fund "did not develop any project", Alberto Aragones, who is described as GSF's legal representative for its Italian units, said in written answers.
"GSF Sicar bought the projects, from third-party developers, once they were 'fully authorised'," Aragones said.
Aragones was also investment director for GSF Capital Pte Ltd, which owns 10 percent of the Global Solar Fund and is controlled by Romero.
In September 2011, GSF suspended further investments in Italy "until the situation is clarified" after the Brindisi court had seized the plants that were the focus of investigation, according to a statement sent to Italian news organisations 11 months ago.
Asked if Suntech knew about GSF's legal troubles, Aragones replied: "Any relevant information has always been included at least in GSF Sicar audited financial statements."
FRAUD STILL A MYSTERY
Romero has emerged as the central figure in the fund's descent into legal controversy, having been blamed by Suntech for providing the company with the 560 million euros ($700 million) in apparently fake collateral for a loan made to the fund.
Romero did not comment after repeated requests through Italian lawyers who have represented him. Through public relations firm Allea, Romero denied any wrongdoing earlier this month.
He had been legal administrator for many of the companies being pursued by Italian prosecutors until last year.
GSF said Romero had been responsible for the fund's Italian investment strategy, and that his strategy "has always been validated" by the GSF board, "top level consultants" and Chinese and European lenders to the fund.
Romero's private firm, GSF Capital, pledged the bonds to Suntech so that the Chinese company could use them as part of its efforts to help secure bank funding for one of the fund's investee firms, Solar Puglia II.
Solar Puglia II - through its own subsidiaries Energetica Wing II, Solar Puglia and Energetica Wing - owns the firms charged with illegal construction of solar power plants in Italy, court documents show.
Ghizzardi said his investigations had not found any evidence related to the suspected bond fraud.
Abuse of the approvals process has been widespread in Puglia, where fields of lucrative black solar panels replaced traditional crops of olives and grapes, and most of the cases were not prosecuted, Ghizzardi and Italian energy experts said.
Large, multi-megawatt projects were artificially split into single-megawatt projects, each small enough to be approved within 30 days without much scrutiny under a permitting process designed for small solar farms of less than 1 MW, they said.
In reality, though, the fast-track approvals were used to assemble larger, multi-megawatt projects to give the fund access to Europe's richest renewable incentives, they said.
Under incentives only recently wound back by a cash-strapped Rome, developers were given guarantees by the state to sell their electricity at above-market prices for 20 years.

Swift action needed to save world's declining fisheries-study
OSLO |.
The study focused on the world's "unassessed" fisheries - those that lack good data about the size of stocks. Unassessed fisheries make up 80 percent of the global catch and the vast majority of the world's 10,000 fisheries, the authors said.
"Small-scale unassessed fisheries are in substantially worse shape than was previously thought," Christopher Costello, lead author of the study at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told a telephone news conference.
"The good news here is that it's not too late," he said. "These fisheries can rebound. But the longer we wait, the harder and more costly it will be ... In another ten years, the window of opportunity may have closed."
Unassessed fisheries are declining worldwide and are in a worse condition than their assessed counterparts, the study found. Many well-studied fisheries in developed nations have been recovering in recent years thanks to better management.
CORAL REEFS
One way to promote recovery is to grant communities or individual fishermen exclusive rights to catches in return for respecting "no take" zones. These could be around coral reefs or mangrove swamps that are nurseries for fish, experts said.
"The silver lining is that we have proven solutions," Michael Arbuckle, senior fisheries specialist at the World Bank, told the news conference. "Ending open access in favor of fishing rights is the key."
Other steps to avert collapse include more assessments of fisheries, typically costing $500,000 each, to help to set quotas.
"The revolution here is to empower fishermen to lead the way in recovering fish populations," said Amanda Leland, of the Environmental Defense Fund.
Among signs of recovery, U.S. landings of fish and shellfish hit a 17-year high in 2011, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. The landings were worth $5.3 billion.
In general, Costello said that unassessed fisheries with slow-maturing fish such as sharks were worse off than small, short-lived fish such as anchovies or herring, which could rebound quickly.
The report used data from well-studied fisheries to infer the condition of similar but unassessed fisheries.
Costello said that "the biggest scientific hurdle" had been to ensure confidence that the data were accurate when the fisheries were unassessed.
"Without good information on fish populations, managing (fisheries) sustainably can be a hard thing to do. It's like trying to decide how far you can drive your car without knowing how much gas is in the tank," he said.

UPDATE 3-Sinking German investor morale fuels recession talk
* ZEW sentiment index drops to -15.7 in Nov from -11.5 in Oct
* Gloomy survey follows poor run of domestic data
* Recession-bound euro zone could drag Germany down too
* Index reading hits markets
By Victoria Bryan and Sakari Suoninen
MANNHEIM, Germany, Nov 13 .
"For now, the ZEW looks broadly consistent with economic stagnation in Germany," said Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics.
"But we think that the economy will slide back into recession next year as the peripheral debt crisis intensifies and business and consumer confidence weaken further."
Third-quarter results from leading European companies mirrored the grim picture.
Germany's No. 1 utility, E.ON, warned of weakening power demand in Europe and said it may close plants, cutting its profit outlook for next year.
British mobile phone giant Vodafone wrote down the value of its business in Spain and Italy by 5.9 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) and lowered its cash flow forecast as recession-hit southern Europeans cut back on mobile usage.
Seeking to calm unease on markets about the spreading crisis on the euro zone's periphery, ECB President Mario Draghi unveiled a new bond-buying programme in September allowing for potentially unlimited interventions for struggling states.
No country has yet chosen to tap the programme, which comes with conditions attached, and with concern growing about the burden of keeping the region's debt-scarred periphery afloat, the main reading from the ZEW monthly poll found economic sentiment fell to -15.7 from -11.5 in October.
That came well below the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for -9.8 and sent the euro to a fresh two-month low against the dollar while European stocks extended losses.
Jittery markets also digested an open clash between euro zone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund about how to bring Greece's debt down, which delayed the release of a 31 billion euro aid tranche vital to keeping Athens afloat.
"With the (European Central) Bank yet to purchase any bonds and worries about Greece escalating again, investors seem to be losing what little faith they had regained," McKeown said.
Recession-hit Italy's two biggest banks, Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit both set aside billions of euros against risky loans, though they delivered higher than expected profits and boosted their capital bases.
Germany long appeared relatively immune to the region's economic troubles as private consumption remained robust at home and its manufacturers benefited from healthy demand in markets beyond Europe.
But as the euro zone edges back into recession, Germany's economy has taken a turn for the worse too.
Gross domestic product data due on Thursday is expected to show growth in Germany slowed to 0.2 warning the crisis in Europe would weigh on earnings this year as firms spend less on advertising.
"Prevailing recessionary developments in the euro zone impact the German economy via foreign trade and a lack of confidence. This is likely to be a burden for economic growth in Germany during the next six months," ZEW President Wolfgang Franz said.
That tallies with the Economy Ministry's view that growth will probably slow in the fourth quarter of this year and the first of 2013.
Germany, traditionally an export-driven economy, sends around 40.
Many economists expect German GDP to contract in the fourth quarter for the first time since the end of 2011, though healthy consumer appetite and a robust jobs market should help Germany to avoid a recession, defined as two quarters of contraction.
Christian Dick, an economist at the think tank, said he did not expect Germany to experience a "sharp recession as we see in the other European countries."
Others took a more optimistic view.
The head of Germany's BGA trade association, Anton Boerner, said on Tuesday both exports and imports would rise to record levels next year as global trade picked up to offset the downturn in the euro zone.
ZEW's gauge of current conditions slipped to 5.4 from 10.0 in October, coming in below the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a reading of 8.0.
The index was based on a survey of 263 analysts and investors conducted between Oct 29 and Nov 12, ZEW said.

Debt ceiling much scarier? Not according to our wise leaders like Harry Reid who said their was no time to waste in passing the pork loaded $60 billion Sandy storm bill. They act like there is no debt problem in America.
Sooner or later the American people are going to realize that OB and his cronies are going to bankrupt their country. How so many Americans voted to re-elect Obama is a wonder. They will soon find out that this was a big mistake.
The unwillingnes of the conservatives (“my way or the highway”) is the cause of this, and I will never forgive them. They should have come to some sort of agreement that we can all live with, months ago. They are like children whose toys were taken away from them. And they want to start another war, when we can’t afford their last two wars…
@Raelyn
I will never forgive the Democrats or the Republicans for spending so much money over the last 12 years. I doubt our kids and grand kids will forgive them either. When we have to wait until age 80 to draw Social Security we can all look back to 2000 till whenever we finally get serious about our fiscal situation and realize how stupid it was to continuously practice Keynesian economics and completely ignore deficits and the debt..
All the Americans who supported that war, and cheered for its violence, when they lament the state of America’s current deficit, should look in the mirror.
As Dick Cheney said, deficits don’t matter, and Republicans proved it.
Now, deficits are the most important thing for Republicans, next to protecting low rates for millionaires and billionaires.
Neither side can resist spending. It is just that one side pretends, and the other side ignores.
“considering how close lawmakers came to a default.”
Not true. There was never a danger of default even if the debt ceiling were not raised. There was more than enough revenue to service the debt and bond holders always get paid FIRST. There was a danger to other recipients of Federal tax revenues, including Social Security, but the bond holders would have been paid and Tim Geithner had contingency plans to make sure they did.
I hope the GOP stands firm and again uses the debt ceiling as leverage to try to cut reckless government spending.
We will achieve fiscal balance in this country, and if it isn’t in the next 4 years, at least we can slow Obama and the Dems down and minimize the damage done.
@adamsmith said: “America spent over $2 trillion dollars on that war.”
Yea and we spent another $14.5T on the federal debt NOT on war…
What I am personally (Republican or Democrat) doesn’t matter. The parties and politicians don’t serve the public, they serve the lobbies and interests that fund them. Our deficit has doubled in the last 10 years. In particular, the %GDP has gone from the high 60% range four years ago to just over 100%, this year. Our deficit has gone up $4 trillion dollars in slightly less than three years. The last calculation I saw showed our deficit at $16.370 trillion against a $16.394 trillion ceiling. I hope my math is bad, but, that looks like there is $.024 trillion left. These desperate realities are barely reported by the mainstream media. I don’t know how to interpret the infatuation with the “fiscal cliff” when there is a far more serious problem. Spending. The system is so broken, it not only can’t repair itself, it can’t even acknowledge the problem or stop making it worse. Forget four years from now or even two years from now. I can’t imagine what will happen between now and six to twelve months from now.
For decades the limit has been nothing but a reasons for the politicians to claim OT pay – This cliff was another perfect setup, wasn’t it? The percentage of tax income paid on interest will hit 100% in less than 10 years, if we keep the current deficit level. Is it scary for tax payers? Yeah, of course. But that’s a dream come true for the politicians. After they are “laid off” they can sit on the beach watching tax dollars flowing into their accounts without lifting a finger. Why would anyone think any party is serious about limiting the deficit, if endebting the nation serves their (about the only) common interest?
@SDaignault: “… I can’t imagine what will happen between now and six to twelve months from now.” LOL still remember the end of the emperor’s parade – who was more embarrassed: The boy, the emperor, or the bystanders?
I have strong doubts there will be resolution of the fiscal cliff in 2012 or 2013. To continue operating, the federal government must come to a balanced budget. If not now when the economy is growing, why ever? As analysts have noted the USA still has a lot of wealth to spend down, but once that is gone the USA will be in far worse shape than Greece is now.

John Lewis appalling customer service. Present ordered on 9th December to be delivered to my elderly aunt and uncle. Found out in January that it had not been delivered, very upsetting for myself and relatives. Emailed a complaint. They replied the item was damaged in transit and they had tried to call me on 20th December, no call, email or text received and 20th Dec was far too late when the present should have been delivered. They refunded the money on 2nd January but NOT the delivery charge. Why did they not contact me after the five working days when they knew it had not been delivered. I could have ordered something else. I accept things can go wrong with deliveries but good customer service would have been to ensure they made contact with me immediately they knew the item was damaged. After two emails asking why the delivery charge was not refunded, they never even tried to deliver it, I have not been answered. Surely the delivery charge should be refunded. An email from Elizabeth Cuthbert states that present was refunded on 31st. December 2013!!!!!!! There appears to be no quality check on customer service replies.
I have used John Lewis click and collect service and that worked very well, however, I wonder if there had been a problem whether the same customer service team would have handled it as badly.

SALINEVILLE - From the very start, turmoil was present at the Salineville Village Council meeting.
It began when the council members were looking over the minutes of the Sept. 17 meeting, and Councilman Tom Hays questioned whether the word "screaming" accurately reflected his tone of voice with Mayor Mary Smith during a real estate discussion.
"I know I was a little upset with the mayor, and then at Sally [Councilwoman Sally Keating], but this says I screamed," Hays said. "I would like this changed - screamed is the wrong adverb."
Councilmen Jim Howdershelt also commented, "We're here to debate. Sometimes you have to use your loud voice to get attention."
After limited discussion, council members approved the minutes 4-to-1, with the understanding Hays wanted an objection made in the current minutes. Hays was the only vote against approving the record.
Commotion erupted soon after when Smith informed council members that Fiscal Officer Esther Anderson had received an e-mail from The United States Department of Agriculture requesting a written response to the village's recent audit and the 17 non-compliance findings and 11 recommendations contained in the accompanying management letter.
Smith asked council for a motion to allow her, Anderson and Village Solicitor Andy Beech to draft a response, and Council President Rick Beadle questioned whether volunteers from the council could be included, and whether Beech's presence was necessary.
Beadle said he'd rather not have Beech because they pay him by the hour, and his understanding was they were just writing a letter.
Smith responded that she would like to have legal advice in composing the response.
During the discussion, Hays said the village had one non-compliance finding and that the rest of the issues related to a lack of information on the part of the auditor's office.
When Smith insisted there were 17, Hays asked the mayor if she was calling him a liar, left the table and entered Anderson's office. Hays returned with a stack of papers, looked through them and approached Smith, who was seated. Hays then pointed to a portion of a document he said proved there was only one non-compliance finding.
Hays also said Smith was "trying to disgrace the previous administration" and Smith replied she was not.
Smith asked Hays to sit down several times, smacked her gavel on the table and said, "Get him out." Hays was escorted from the room by police officer Adam Little.
Upon Hays' exit, Howdershelt said, "If he's leaving, then I'm out, too," and got up from his seat and walked toward the exit.
Beadle pointed out that with two council members now gone, there were not enough members left to hold a meeting.
From the doorway, Howdershelt said he would return if Hays was also allowed to return. Hays did not return, although Howdershelt eventually did, but said, "I'll stay; but the next time, we want to debate."
Beech said, "The letter says what it says. There shouldn't have to be a debate about the audit report, you're just responding to the letter."
Smith said, "All we had on the table was the response to the e-mail - the audit wasn't the issue." She later thanked Howdershelt for staying at the meeting.
Council eventually passed a motion to allow Smith, Anderson, Keating and Hays to draft a letter and have Beech look over it prior to mailing.
Council members also sorted out a new seating arrangement - at one point passing a motion for members Zeb Locklear, who was not present, and Hays to switch seats.
"I know this is foolish, but this is what it is," said Beadle.
Discussion continued on the seating arrangement, until Smith drew a seating arrangement on a legal pad, and said, "The next council meeting, this is how it will be."
Pastor Rodney Ohler, said he understood a concern expressed by Howdershelt and Hays about not being able to see and hear other members of the council and Beech, and that he thought a new arrangement might produce better dialogue.
Howdershelt expressed a desire for the village's officials to come together. "You people, all of us, we have to come together around here," he said, noting that he once had a dress hung on his mailbox with three council member's names on it. He said he was asked if he was joining those members.
"I want to do the right thing," Howdershelt said. Beadle responded that he did the right thing by staying in the meeting.
Councilman Craig Roberts, in speaking about the meeting, said, "I guess all I can say is I feel we could get a lot more done if all parties thought about what we can do now rather than what's been done in the past."
Council eventually did conduct some business, including hiring Brandon Klopfenstein as a part-time police officer. Klopfenstein is a former U.S. Border Patrol agent who was stationed in Texas, and is currently an officer with Notre Dame College in South Euclid, Ohio, and a reserve officer with Waynesburg village.
Also hired during the meeting was Vicki Casey, who will be paid $10 an hour to catalog police evidence. Casey's contract is not to exceed 100 hours, and Smith said her work should be completed by early December.

Just in case you forgot, here is Spokeo to remind us that the web isn’t private. In fact it’s so un-private, what is the point of talking about online privacy in the first place? First people get down on one site after another about privacy, when at the end of the day, it’s not private. Never meant to be private. You want privacy? Don’t go online, stay away, and buy land in Montana or something. Oh, and quit blaming Facebook for all your privacy woes.
The more interesting story here is that about ~4 years ago when I had a small conversation with the original Spokeo founder Harrison Tang, Spokeo was just another harmless social network aggregation site. In that short amount of time, Spokeo like any good resilient startup has shifted it’s business model 360 from where it started. I totally applaud the efforts there. But in the same token, I question the validity of the current social aggregation startups out there. Do we really know that they won’t flip the 180 or 360 and change into a privacy aggregation money making machine for their founders? What really are their intentions is what we should be asking.
Now if you followed the above link, you see that Harrison also added a position at People Search back in ’07 timeframe. And now his Spokeo is doing the same thing. What do I smell? Money. In the same token, isn’t CrunchBase doing essentially a similar model of data storage and revelation by what they do?
Now much has already been written about this, but for basics, go here to this article about Spokeo Privacy and how to take your name out of their database. If you don’t have the time to read all that, here is a snippet on how to do this:
The good news is you can get yourself off of there.
- Go to Spokeo and type in your name.
- Copy the URL when it brings up your information.
- Go to the bottom of the page and click on “privacy”
- Paste the URL in the box provided
- Include your email address (it gives you further instructions via email)
- Enter the code
- Go to your email and click on the link they provide to you
- Confirm the directory listing has been deleted
- Go back to Spokeo and put in your name to be sure it was deleted and they can’t find you
Hope this helps!
Technically Speaking, when you are online and you do informational transactions online, you do not have privacy. Privacy is an illusion sold and bought for the price of the banner ads that bother you so much. Privacy is only something that happens offline, but the minute you connect, you can bet it’s no longer private.

Following a one-year demonstration of an automated supply chain management solution from SGS, using Savi Technology location- and sensor-based technology, the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) has certified the solution for full deployment to reduce the risk of cargo being stolen or diverted while in transit. The system was tested on one supply chain route, and is now being expanded this month with transportation companies using the technology within another corridor. Cargo travels from the seaport in Dar es Salaam to neighboring countries, such as Zambia, Malawi, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), at a rate of approximately 15,000 loads per month.
Under a TRA mandatory program, trucks carrying goods through Tanzania must be equipped with an electronic identification system that links a unique ID number to each vehicle and its owner. Data regarding the movements of the goods transported by that vehicle is then stored on the TRA's server. The TRA has recruited five suppliers of tracking technologies to sell their solutions directly to transporters and cargo owners. One TRA-approved electronic-tracking solution is being provided by SGS and Savi, according to Philippe Isler, the global business-development manager at SGS' governments and institutions services (GIS) division.
SGS, a global company headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, provides inspection, testing and certification services, as well as a solution known as SGS OMNIS, for supply chain security management. SGS OMNIS utilizes Savi Technology hardware and software that combines GPRS, GPS and active RFID technologies, along with a variety of sensors, to capture and store information about the conditions of a truck or railcar load of cargo, as well as if someone might be attempting to access the goods along the supply chain (see RFID News Roundup: Savi Teams With SGS on Tracking Services, Intros New Software).
The SGS OMNIS system has been adopted by government agencies in Kenya, Ghana and, most recently, Tanzania, in order to obtain data about the supply chain of cargo, as well as create a record of their movements along traffic routes. The Savi technology, known as the Savi Mobile Tracking System, includes hardware installed on vehicles with a variety of sensors (such as those for monitoring temperature, humidity, light or pressure) to detect and transmit data regarding the load, according to William Clark, Savi's president and CEO. The Savi system also includes software that receives, manages and stores that information and provides alerts as necessary. Savi Technology hosts the server on which that data is stored and then shared with the TRA and logistics companies.
To determine whether the SGS OMNIS solution could effectively collect data and provide necessary alerts, Isler says, the TRA first allowed the solution to be tested on one corridor on which trucks and railcars travel. Now that the agency has certified the technology, SGS plans to offer its solution in additional corridors throughout Tanzania, expanding the coverage one corridor at a time.

Biography
New Jersey native James Murphy started out as a drummer for such bands as Speedking and Pony, but he tired of the politics and posing of the American punk movement and developed an affinity for house. Teaming up with Mo' Wax founder Tim Goldsworthy, Murphy started making a name for himself as a producer for acts on their Death From Above (aka DFA) label, including the Rapture and Radio 4. As his expertise in fusing dance and punk-rock developed, Murphy began to work on his own compositions, resulting in "Losing My Edge" (2002). This amusing invective about musical elitism caught the ear of the critics and defined his signature sound: bleepy electronica with thick "real" basslines and Mark E. Smith-style vocals. Indeed, Murphy has been quoted as saying that "The Fall are my Beatles," even though he is worried that such slavish devotion to Smith's vocal technique will inevitably invite some form of castigation from the man himself. Such was the popularity of "Losing My Edge" that Murphy decided to release "Yeah" (2004), which is essentially him saying "yeah" over and over to deliberately confound fans expecting another clever lyrical diatribe. Challenging expectations is Murphy's manifesto: he sees LCD Soundsystem as "a laboratory for experiments on what a band should be."

Anat Kam in more carefree days
If you’re an Israeli editor or reporter, you know what thousands of other Israelis know. That Anat Kam is under house arrest for allegedly leaking up to 1,000 top secret IDF documents to Haaretz reporter Uri Blau, who’s been writing some of the most hard-hitting exposes about army and defense ministry malfeasance over the past year or so. You also know that Blau is in self-imposed exile in London aware that the police want him for questioning in the case and that Haaretz’s lawyers are negotiating for his return.
You know that there is a prosecution-requested gag order on the fact that she was arrested and the reason for her arrest, which makes her the most widely known “disappeared” person possibly in the world. You know that Kam faces an espionage charge, and up to 14 years in prison. You know that her lawyers are also negotiating a plea bargain and that she is hoping for no jail time or a reduced sentence. You’d also know that Kam and her lawyer have lobbied hard and largely successfully for Hebrew blogs, Hebrew Wikipedia and other online sites to take down material about her arguing it will improve her chances of getting a less severe sentence.
That’s what you’d know. And also what you can’t breathe a word of to your readers. So what can you do? You can write eloquent, oblique columns decrying military censorship, secret detentions, gag orders, the over-cozy relationship between the military, intelligence agencies and the judiciary. You can even tell your readers there’s a really big story about which you can’t tell them.
It’s all very strange when you read such material. It reminds you of a blind man feeling his way across the back of a camel and trying to guess what it is, all while you’re seeing it right before your own eyes. You feel sorry for these poor souls who know many things but can’t convey them to the rest of their countrymen and women. But after feeling sorry, you begin to feel angry that none of them takes the bull by the horns and does a Peter Finch, yelling “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore,” and then spilling the beans.
While it’s true that Israeli media outlets could face severe sanction for breaking a gag order–their reporters could lose their licenses, government lawyers could tie them up in court for years, they could lose access to government news sources–it seems to me that if Israel is a democracy and if there is a press worthy of the name that someone has to step up and defy the bastards. So far, no one has (though some brave Israeli journalists like Mya Guarnieri have reported the story for foreign papers).
Not so Israeli bloggers though. They have stepped up to the plate. They are reporting this story. They are naming names. They are not intimidated. Blogs like Nimby, Philosophical Outlook, and Human Communication have done what blogs should do when all others around them have lost their nerve or their balls–they told it like it is. There may be other blogs I’m overlooking and I’d love to hear about them. I also invite those interested in learning more about this to join the bi-lingual Facebook group, We Want the Truth About Anat Kam, where I’m learning much of this.
Since I began this blog in 2003 I’ve felt a strong need to link my work to Israelis (and Palestinians) including bloggers. It is important to share important political developments and create a sense of community between us and I’ve tried to do that. Bloggers unfortunately don’t like being organized or told what to do or what’s important. So my efforts have been fitful. Sometimes like at the J Street bloggers panel they work and other times not.
Given the language gap it’s also proven hard to share out respective work. You can’t easily reprint the best work of Hebrew language blogs unless you can translate it and that takes time and energy. And vice versa. All of this meant that bloggers in Israel and bloggers outside Israel were more or less like ships passing in the night.
But this story has changed that. Now in their hour of need many Israelis see the benefits of foreign media including blogs. That’s the only way they currently can stay up to date on what their government doesn’t want them to know. This blog has more visibility inside Israel than perhaps it has ever had before. What I hope is that this will not change after the Kam story does. We need each other.
In one of the more ironic developments in a case loaded with irony, it seems that Anat Kam wrote a 2009 story for Walla while she worked there, covering a conference on the use and abuse of military gag orders. The money quote and most poignantly ironic passage is this one from a senior Israeli police officer participating on the panel who, after reminding the audience of the supposedly welcome fact that the police request only 60 such gag orders per year, says:
Clearly I prefer to conduct investigations in secret, but I’m aware of the limitations on the police in a democratic society. Sometimes, we seek to prevent publicizing an investigation in order that law-breakers won’t benefit from exposure of the information.
If the results of the Kam case weren’t so troubling, I’d almost call this irony delicious. As it is, it makes me feel outrage.
How’s this for another irony: Wikipedia, which exists to disseminate knowledge and information irregardless of the whims of government authority decided in the case of Anat Kam to remove its article from Hebrew Wikipedia at Kam’s request. You’d think the editors would’ve understood that self-censorship by Wikipedia itself is a terribly problematic development. The article remains down.
I read another Israeli on Facebook pose an interesting argument defending Kam’s act of leaking top secret military documents. He said that she could argue that though she was breaking the law in doing so, her leak was designed to uncover a far worse crime, that of targeted killings committed by the highest echelons of the military in violation of the law as determined by the Supreme Court. This argument might work better in a constitutional democracy in which Court rulings are viewed as legal precedent. In Israel that isn’t so. But I still think it’s an appealing argument.
Finally, Ran Cohen of Nimby e-mailed me today that there is one benefit, either intended or unintended, for the IDF and intelligence apparatus in this gag order: it focuses attention on the plight of a young women while diverting attention from where it should be–on the rampant, unaccountable, illegal acts of the IDF high command. It allows us to lose sight of the fact that the Israeli Supreme Court, faced with Haaretz reports that the army’s most senior officers were giving the judiciary the middle finger regarding complying with its 2006 ruling on targeted assassinations–did nothing. The IDF enjoys virtual impunity in Israeli society and the Court does little or nothing to prevent it. Uri Blau’s story reveals that for some in Israel the rule of law is little more than an inconvenient theory honored in the breach, if at all.
Anat Kam’s is the tragedy of an individual, while the documents she leaked reveal the tragedy of an entire nation whose democracy has been eviscerated.

There are several attacks on Democracy going on with this case:
1. The military and intelligences services are above the law.
2. The military and intelligence services can order the courts to block and censor the press.
3. The courts, the military/intelligence services AND the press/media are ALL complicit in subverting a true democratic system.
The courts and the press are pillars responsible for ensuring the integrity of a Democracy, but they are reverting to the authority of the military rather than defending Democracy. It appears that no one really cares, since they are all complicit, and this is because there is no formal Constitution, and the problem can be narrowed down to two questions: What prevents Israel from having a Constitution? Is Zionism incompatible with Democracy?
(The worst part is that Israel has also become the 5th column in the U.S. via Aipac. I know there will be some who question this statement, but the Lobby’s influence in Congress has really become more than obvious, making it impossible to exert a positive influence and impose measures to correct the direction of Israel’s misguided foreign policy.)
One could cite even more attacks on democracy in the US. Yes, the Israel Lobby has a lot of influence over the US congress, but so do the other military-industrial-complex lobbies have influence. And they are working in collusion. It is very convenient for Israel and the US to maintain this reciprocity in attempting to control the world, or at least the Middle East. Criticize not only AIPAC, look toward Obama and his controllers, too.
Thank you for reporting on this disturbing case. Your blog is where I first learned most of the details about this.
One comment, though. You write: “which makes her the most widely known “disappeared” person possibly in the world”
Well, not really. I know of at least two disappeared persons that are far more famous than her, and I assume there are more.
One of these is Gao Zhisheng.
Another is Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the eleventh Panchen Lama.
Incidentally, these two were really “disappeared”, while Kamm could be better described as “banished” or “silenced”. Which teaches us that the Israeli regime has more to aspire to, and that the collapse of democracy in Israel can (and I believe will) continue quite a while more.
Hi Richard,
Thanks for the good words (I am from the “Philosophical Outlook”). They help in such times :-)
On what kind of colaboration did you thought of?
Cheers,
Tal
Are there some good Israeli blogs or for that matter Palestinian blogs published in English? I hadn’t really thought of this before–I read human rights websites sometimes (B’Tselem and one or two Palestinian ones occasionally, along with AI and HRW), but the blogs I read on this subject are written in America (or England, maybe, in the case of JSF).
My god she is beautiful.
Such a contrast to the, er, “judge” woman.
I am always amazed that many beautiful women do not rely on the genetic luck of their looks and instead do much more with their lives than I ever did.

If you thought some of the other typical calls for gun control post-tragedy were irresponsible, this one takes the cake from the NY Daily News’ Editorial Board
Blood on hands of Obama, Mitt and N.
Could Obama have attempted to do something pre-massacre? Sure, he could have attempted to pass legislation that restricting the sales of certain weapons and ammo clips when he had Democrats in control of the Senate and House, which would have meant that he could have purchased different guns legally. Or purchased them illegally, like many other criminals have done. It’s not Obama’s fault. It’s not Mitt’s fault. And it’s not the NRA’s fault that Holmes is a raving wackjob killer. Senator John Kerry (D-Mass) owns one of those scary weapons, a Chinese variant of an AK-47, yet, has never gone on a rampage. Lots of people do. They also own shotguns and other rifles not covered by the previous assualt weapons ban, and do not use them for massacres.
In a vain claim of innocence, the fanatics will say Holmes is a monster and a maniac, that he fired and fired and fired as a man possessed. Each protestation clamps their fingers with his around the trigger.
The same NY Daily News is reporting that.
“Let’s just say he hasn’t shown any remorse,” the employee said. “He thinks he’s acting in a movie.”
He’s spitting on guards just like the Joker in The Dark Knight. He’s obviously bat guano insane. But, according to the same NY Daily News, it’s not his fault.
Because they made sure that virtually everyone, Holmes included, has unfettered legal access to heavy weaponry. And they made sure he was permitted by law to drive to the kill scene with a fully loaded arsenal.
Except, he doesn’t have unfettered access. And where there’s a will there’s a way. If a criminal wants a gun, they’ll get it. Handguns are mostly illegal in Britain, yet criminals still get them. And, no guns? How about building a few bombs? Or one big bomb. The recipes are extremely easy to find on the Internet. Shockingly easy. He could have decided to drive a car into people, as has been done before.
Guns are heavily restricted in Chicago, yet they have been used for a large number of crimes and murders this year. But, liberals never want to let a good tragedy go to waste even before the dead are buried.
Doug Ross highlights the use of guns in places that have heavy restrictions like Chicago, NYC, and even Sweden (which has an almost total ban on guns). He further points out that people can manufacture guns themselves.
Can you ban evil? Of course not.
But in the liberal’s Utopian worldview, evil can somehow be stopped. If only society’s elite — the master-planners — can be given enough control over human activity, they could construct a perfect government and prevent all violence. Notice, however, that society’s elite are always protected by arms.
American Power has the insane cover of the NY Daily News.
Let’s not forget, Holmes had his apartment booby trapped with a large number of bombs. No guns? Well, make more bombs. Crazy is still crazy.
The fact is, 99.999999999% of gun owners are responsible citizens not bent on using them illegally. Quite a few of them are liberals. As Joan of Argghh tweeted back to me “They don’t hate guns; they hate YOU having a gun.”

December 1st: Hand in Hand
Welcome to my advent calendar!
A woman needs to chose her battles wisely. Some are lost before they even begin. I do like my home to be uncluttered, but my inner minimalist curls up for a long nap as soon as (s)he hears « Christmas preparations » … and thus we are a multiple advent calendar family:
First one for every child from the grand-parents (with chocolat, bien sûr!).
Then one we made years ago from boxes of matches to be filled with little surprises (avoiding chocolat, if I can help it). The children insist on reviving this thing every year, pretending tradition’s sake, in reality they hope for more chocolat.
One without chocolat. I insist on this one, pretending pedagogic principles, in reality I just think it is beautiful…
And now we have the one I like best that is the advent calendar here on the blog!!
So that’s the idea: until Christmas I will post every day a little something, un petit rien . Not chocolat.
With or without a connection to coaching.
With or without a connection to Christmas.
JUST A MOMENT’S BREAK FROM THE EVERY DAY RUSH.
And yes, there will be a present or two. I’ll tell you more in a couple of days…
So, december 1st:
When the day is grey and I am grumpy, this video is an instant pick-me-up: Hand in Hand
What do you think?
Have a beautiful day!

EDitors UPDATE: Positive rating and recognition has been given to Commercial Capital Training Group for its commitment to excellence in customer service.
Ripoff Reports discussions with Commercial Capital Training Group have discovered a commitment by the company to total client satisfaction. This means that clients can expect that the company will work towards finding a mutually satisfactory resolution to any complaints or concerns. Commercial Capital Training Group listens carefully to any client concerns and is constantly improving their business based on suggestions and feedback from past customers.
.
Commercial Capital Training Groups principal, Mr. Kris Roglieri, has informed us that his personal philosophy for any of his multiple businesses is that his customers needs comes first. As a successful businessman, Mr. Roglieri feels it is critical to listen to his clients and respond properly. By always putting his organizations customers first, Mr. Roglieri hopes to maintain Commercial Capital Training Group as a successful enterprise both now and for many years to come.
Another top executive of the company told us that Mr. Roglieris personal business philosophy is based on a premise that "strives to add value in its services as they understand that a successful business model is based on value-added services, and client care. Commercial Capital Training Groups mission statement says it all: "Our goal is to provide our clients the best quality, value and professional excellence in the industry." Some of the other things Ripoff Report learned during our review: typical customer feedback reads: Commercial Capital Training Groups commitment to supporting us after training is nothing short of excellent. It has been over a year now and the support that I have received after training is just as good as the first day out of training. There are few companies that take as many steps in making their customers feel satisfied as Commercial Capital Training Group.
Commercial Capital Training Group targets any organization or individual looking to expand into commercial finance and becoming a commercial loan consultant. According to the company, their 7 day training is much more complete and comprehensive than competitors who usually have 3 to 5 day sessions. The training teaches between 40 and 50 different financial products as compared to competitors focusing on 15 to 20 products. Additionally, the training company also has exclusive access to Mr. Roglieris other companies in their Albany location and also in Rochester, NY. The training companys access to lenders in-house is unique for this financial training. The instructors are not only financial trainers they are also financial lenders that bring that experience to the trainees.
The purpose of the Commercial Capital Training Group is to seek to develop entrepreneurs to work in the field of commercial finance. The experience consists of on-site seven day training in all facets of underwriting, finance, and running an independent business. Consumers (trainees) are taught 45 different commercial financial instruments involving in person and conference call/webinars with commercial lenders representing different asset types. The training also enables the trainees to gain personal access to lenders. A critical component of the training is the support of the company to each trainee following the end of the on-site one week training experience. Lifetime support is offered by the company through 5 support staff members that are available by direct phone contact at any time following the conclusion of the training.
The company advertises in financial trade and business publications as well as business opportunity and franchising journals (although it is not a franchise). Additionally, many of the potential clients may have a very specific business-type focus and are looking to branch out or expand their repertoire of financial products by gaining the knowledge from this training. As to turning leads into clients the process is with clearly conveying to potential clients all the upfront information about the training and the lifetime support following conclusion of the class.
Currently, the company feels that they do not have any internal processes or procedures where there was a documented need for improvement. They have had earlier instances of both the change from a 5 day program to a 7 day program and also about making an internal change so that at the conclusion of the program all trainees now have a direct cell phone line to their on-staff support person. When the company first started out all support calls were required to be made to the office phone number during normal business hours. Based upon feedback where participants may be working on the west coast or on a project on a weekend it was determined that the support staff would provide direct cell phone numbers and be available after normal hours to address these concerns.
In dealing with complaints, it was stated that the company feels they are an open book. They thought that they had not experienced what would be considered a true complaint; but rather, honest feedback from the trainees that have led to improvements to the program. As a case in point several attendees in early sessions indicated that the initial training sessions that were only five days in length was not enough to convey the information. This resulted in now once a month offering is a seven day session running from a Monday through the following Sunday.
Another example of what might be considered a complaint was when individuals that had completed the program where having difficulty in getting phone calls returned from private lenders that were presenters during the week of training. In these instances the companys support staff members have interceded on behalf of the trainees in getting lenders to communicate with the trainees on a timely basis.
The company stated that they did not know of an instance or issue where a client/trainee was dissatisfied with their training experience. They stated that there have been some instances where following the conclusion of the classes where individuals did not have a clear understanding of some of the specific materials and needing a little hand-holding to help them to adequately complete a task. They spoke of two instances of reports on Rip-off where the claims were investigated and found not to be substantiated. They indicated that due to the confidentiality and anonymity of those complaints they do not believe these false claims were filed by program participants; but, perhaps by competitors. They also noted that they have received no complaints from the Better Business Bureau. The company feels that an important part of ensuring the trainee will not end up being dissatisfied with the training is that the company is very selective in who they will accept into the program. The company predetermines if the prospective attendee has the skills and knowledge to participate in the program and be able to work independently following conclusion of the on-site training.
The biggest change to the company in response to do whatever it takes was extending the duration of the training from 5 to 7 days based on the feedback from the initial offerings. They feel it is important to educate the trainee prior to the start of the training as to what to expect during the training and being upfront on their commitment to the attendee before, during and after the conclusion of the week of on-site training. The other change that has been instituted that the owner of the company must be personally notified immediately of any reported complaint to ensure that all appropriate steps can be taken to resolve any issues.
Commercial Capital Training Group feels that to be a part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program through Ripoff Report conveys the level of trust and demonstrates complete integrity to potential clients of his company. They feel individuals will know that the staff will handle all complaints professionally and will do everything possible to make things right.
Commercial Capital Training Group recognizes that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored. If handled correctly, complaints can be valuable learning opportunities. With the feedback generated by Ripoff Reports review, Commercial Capital Training Group has made organizational changes allowing its clients a more streamlined approach to problem resolution and a commitment to a great client experience.
In summary, after our review, which included discussions with executives at Commercial Capital Training Group, Ripoff Report is convinced that Commercial Capital Training BELOW THAT WAS FILED ABOUT Commercial Capital Training .. Commercial Capital Training Group did just that. It should be known the author of the Report below never responded to Ripoff Report so the company could make things right with them.
NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED
---------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial Capital Training Group - Owner Kris Roglieri Prime Commercial Lending - Parent Company Commercial Capital Training Group - A Bad Bet for a Business Career Albany, New York
I also attended the Commercial Capital Training Group (CCTG) course in Albany, New York. I concur with a previous Ripoff Report on this business entity and its principal. The previous report was very similar to my experience. I was told by another classmate that they had seen the Ripoff Report and even sent a copy of it to CCTG and Kris Roglieri prior to attending. The response he received was there was no one by this name who attended the course. that is likely because like myself they changed their name and location to remain anonymous. Second, the Ripoff Report said he was introduced to brokers not lenders. The response from an associate of Kris Roglieri responsible for marketing the training class told him that he would "personally meet lenders of the type impossible to find on your own." His experience and mine was you do NOT meet any direct lenders. There were a few personal presentations and only one could qulaify as a direct lender and this as a business partner of Kris Roglieri. In other words, in introduced us to a lender he was a invested in! You mostly spend five days calling other brokers affiliated with CCTG and Prime Commercial Lending via conference phone. These are scheduled one after the other such that your head is swimming. Breaks are scheduled for five minutes to keep you off-balance and to keep you from discussing the material in small groups. We had some very qualified and highly experienced people in our class. No one caught-on to the fact that these were brokers not lenders. After I got home I started contacting these "lenders" and found they had not disclosed all the qualification of their lending programs during the course...and theta they were actually brokers and not direct lenders. One by one the "lenders" we were introduced to were discovered to be unworkable and non-competitive finance programs. Therefore - think twice before dropping $20,000 plus in this training program. It is not worth it. There is no introductions to lenders and you will only figure out you have nothing to promote except high-cost finance programs to the most desperate of borrowers....you will end up being a legal loan shark and a referral source for brokers and nothing more!

SUBMITTED: Thursday, October 25, 2012POSTED: Thursday, October 25, 2012
This is the reason we are an accredited member of the Better Business Bureau due to our quest to demonstrate our ethical business practices and outstanding customer service to the graduates we serve. There was a previous post on here where we actually decided to use Ripoffs report Arbitration service which the results proved several false statements about our company that ripoff report redacted. In the same post there were statements such as I took their training late last year and could not learn everything in 7 days which would have been in 2011.
This statement and other ones were suspicious due to the fact that we did not have a 7 day training in 2011. We had a 5 and 6 day training in 2011 and have since grown our course outline. Or that we have an answering service when in fact we have a live paid secretary that answers our phones and a direct 24-7 line to our support staff. The problem with forums such as this is anybody can say anything about anybody or a company without being held accountable whether the statements are true or not. In the end we can never prove who the real identity of the poster is due to the protection Ripoff report has under with the first amendment but instead, only respond with statements that expose the inconsistencies and falsehoods of the posts.
With regards to this post I denounce everything that is said here. If this is a real graduate of our program I invite the poster to call me personally anytime (518-694-3047) and I will go over each lender that participates in our coarse to re-familiarize yourself and simply demonstrate how they are direct lenders and not brokers. Out of 45 core lenders that participate in our class we have 3 firms that have unique programs in which the services they provide do not involve lending their own money. One is an advisory firm on commercial securitizations for debt and equity, another is a firm that represents high net worth investors who pool their money together to fund projects and the other is a CMBS and commercial loan modification company.
Outside from that all of our lenders are direct lenders funding off of their own balance sheets. Most of our lenders have Billions of dollars under management or on their balance sheet. Some lenders are publicly traded and have FDIC regulation. We have large private lenders such as Prudential and large banks such as Wells Fargo that participate in our training too small private lenders that have innovative products that cater to businesses that present all different types of credits.
Yes there are some products that serve the financially challenged business in which their product has a higher than normal rate but in turn they are lending to higher risk industries and businesses that could not otherwise get conventional financing. Then there are lenders and banks that have some of the most competitive programs in the country at interest rates and terms that are more competitive than most banks today. So I struggle to see how anybody that has actually been through our class can say our lenders are nothing more than brokers and are not competitive. Again I will personally take the time to show you the 40 plus call reports of our bank lenders and educate you on our private lenders and how they are direct lenders and not brokers as you state numerous times.
In every training that we do, our graduates meet our lenders via in person or on a conference call. There are multiple lenders that fly in to our office to present live to our students every day of our 7 day training. So to state that you only meet 1 lender and it was my company is totally farcical. Training is intensive in the sense that you are constantly learning new topics and introducing lenders but we allow ample time so that each lender is understood, has time to present, and the topics being taught are being comprehended.
Our lenders and banks hand out their information about their lending programs and their qualifying parameters. So there is no mystery when our graduates get home as to what the lenders offer. Two out of the forty five lenders that our graduates work with are companies that I own. There is no mystery around this and we make this very clear in training and is disclosed on our website. These two companies serve two specific lending products where we lend directly to commercial real estate investors and businesses.
As a company we dont tolerate slander and find every portion and statement on this post/ Ripoff report to be libel. We offer our promise and guarantee to what our graduates can expect and also put it in writing in terms of meeting direct lenders, supporting our graduates and additional items given throughout our training.
Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?

1. Tenant lied on the lease about being a non-smoker; in fact tenant was a very heavy smoker with hundreds of cigarette buts all over the property and when i brought this up Dennis did nothing but tell me that the tenant was in fact a light smoker!!!! Really Dennis??? You want proof???
2. Dennis failed to visit the property unpon my request and became very agitated when i asked him to go and inspect the property. I have countless emails and phone messages to support this!!!!
3. Tenant wanted to break his lease because i had decided not to renew it...I advised Dennis that the tenant would have to pay a penalty for the breaking of the lease. Dennise instead took the position of the renter and asserted that i never asked the tenant to pay a penalty.
4. Tenant stole property that was left behind either for their personal use or because it was apart of the garden and/or house accessories. Again Dennis did nothing and instead had the nerve to blame me for leaving the property and asserted that the tenant did not take anything and that it was my fault the property was gone because i had left it there!!! Go figure!!!
Overall, havng Dennis Wilson as a property manager was the worst fucking experience ever and all he cared about was collecting a check every month. As far as i am concern you did nothing!!! and if i have to, i will post every email, text message, letters and/or telephone message on here to support what i am say. I would love for Dennis to respond to this post so that i may reply with all of my evidence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She added that not only would they provide first class dates, but they were la crme de la crme, the best and most effective dating service in the world, "with an international reputation", (Guaranteed results in a short term; thousands of real, sincere pre-screened classy up-scale gentlemen; new sign-in members on a daily basis; coach representatives available at all times to help me through the process; lots of fun, relaxing, cultural events organized by Summit Center every weekend; highly successful methods which produce outstanding results; soon you will not be able to handle so many dates). She described the whole experience as just like being a child in a candy store
Everything looked and sounded great until she asked if I'd like to sign up right then. Well, I was just looking into it and had already decided I wouldn't make a decision that night, especially after finding out their shocking price tag. I wanted to do some research on them before spending that amount. After I told her, "I want to think about it", she kept increasing the pressure to sign and I kept insisting I wanted to think it over. When I didn't budge, she reversed her strategy and began making various personal remarks such as perhaps this is why you're still single and referring to private information from the application form. She then informed me that I suffered from low self-esteem and a fear of commitment.
I should have left that very moment. But although I believed it was ludicrously expensive and I was skeptical about this rude lady, I thought it was a sensible and safe way to meet quality people in a new city. She assured me that most people who come in to interview aren't even eligible to join because they have very strict requirements, which I met, but I didn't inquire as to what they were. I guess I figured that I was a multilingual, multicultural professional with an above average education and that those things were part of it.
Before the interview they asked me for my passport, my driver's license and a major credit card as a form of ID, which now I realize, is the only screening they really do: before pricing the service they run a credit check!!! My understanding was that the purpose of the interview was, among other things, to verify my financial stability. I was a bit wary, but I can understand being careful in introducing persons who are unknown that they are not letting loose financial predators. Many of their questions were intrusive.
While I was having my video and photos taken, I found out that GE does not match people and they don't even call members regularly. Basically, it was an online dating service where GE took amateur digital photos and videos and the rest is up to you. Then I learned that there are "extras" to the service that will give you a competitive "edge" such as the virtual grams for an extra $3600 and photo touch-ups for $500.
They requested my bio to be e-mailed to them before the photo appointment. I e-mailed and still there were typos and paragraphs changed, which have never been corrected despite my requests. In my opinion GE is unethical, unprofessional and completely disorganized.
Of course I wasn't allowed to check out the site at all until I signed up. So after they got my money, I toured their members. As soon as I was able to sign into site and start looking, I found every one of the men I saw during the interview, were inactive and many of the photos they showed me were not even posted. In one day I exhausted the alphabet of my age group. There are (and have been for 7 months) only 64 members listed in the 45-55 age group, 27 of which are inactive, and overlap with the next age group. I know of members who are married, and I will gladly pass word so you can verify, there are members without pictures and others whose pictures are at least 20 years old (they insist that new professional photographs be taken and paid again- every 2 years). The men listed were either too old, too young or involved. Soon I found out that several members misstated their marital status, age, height, etc. and in general the pool was much older than stated during the sales pitch. Their promises for up-scale professionals to date, include maintenance people, truck drivers etc. I was paying for an intelligent, respectable, safe way to find a nice mate. I have not received any selection or call in months. When they bother to answer the phone, they tell me just keep on choosing when there is nobody to choose from. I've got 98 more to go to see if I can find the 2 I'm compatible with, according to the salesgirls anyway, but they hardly have 40 members registered in Summit! I've found only 2 people that live within my 10 mile radius.
Only three guys selected me during the first month, and I found out that when I agreed to meet them, they received a message from GE making them believe that I was the one who selected them, creating false expectations. In 7 months I have had only 3 dates with men who were more socially inept than anyone I've ever met in my life (I've met nicer gentlemen in bars). The three of them complained bitterly about GE and their absolute lack of results. One of them actually spent half our date discussing with his attorney a restraining order his wife!!! had just put on him for sexual assault and battery. The attorney was drunk and vomited on my shoes. I was about to call 911 because I felt my safety was endangered, I was unfamiliar with the area, in the middle of the night, two hours away from my car. This particular guy was referred by Sally, the GE Director, as a classy gentleman, perfect for me. A fourth guy who selected me recently, stood me up twice, once on Xmas! This has been a severe disappointment for me, both financially and emotionally. When I complained to GE they suggested I loosen-up. There was never anything they offered to do themselves.
The lots of fun, relaxing, cultural events organized by Summit Center every weekend were non-existing. The one and only event they had in 2006 (and as I learned later, since June 2005) was organized and posted in their website last minute, took place on the other side of the city, on a week day on working hours, and nobody even bothered to tell me about it. I found about it three days after it was over, and only because I called their office. The so called coach representatives are never available. After numerous calls I finally met this very young girl wearing a very revealing and sloppy outfit. She looked as if she had slept three days in a row in her clothes. I am a business executive in my 50's and this is not what I want to represent me. She would not let me see Sally, and I could not escalate my complaint. I asked then for the head of corporate but they refused to give me more information.
They don't own an answering service. All I have is an e-mail address hosted in Hotmail.com (they don't even own a server). It takes weeks at a time to get an e-mail answer, and what they say makes me think that they have not read at all my complaints or are plain ignoring me. The "GE" website doesn't even have a link that would allow clients to voice their complaints. That, to me, speaks volumes. The staff changes every time I call and nobody gives any follow up.
I tried to find the corporate office of Great Expectations on Google, so as to complain--no luck, I called two other offices in other parts of the country, trying to get the name and address of the owner of the corporation. The staff in both places quizzed me about why I wanted to know, was I writing something, etc., they would not give me any corporate contact information. The second hung up on me--both seemed very defensive. I managed to get a phone number for their main corporate 561 393 7220 which I surmise is located in Florida, but it's not listed. I called that number repeatedly and only got an answering service but they never took or returned any of my calls, as a matter of professional courtesy.
I thought mine was an isolated incident, but I became appalled by the hundreds of complaints, law suits and bad reports against GE I found posted on the Internet. That's probably the reason they don't give you any time to think it over or do any research on them before you commit. I decided to cancel my membership, to save myself from further disappointment. My last e-mails have remained unanswered and the last time I talked to this lady Sally she told me over the phone that if I wanted to sue I was welcome to do it and I would never see any of my money back because I signed a contract, they have a no refund policy, I went there to date and I have dated, so they don't owe me nothing. She finished the conversation with the statement with that attitude of yours, it's not a surprise you are single.
They have thought of every way to get and keep your money, without providing any service. I feel it was a scam, and they know it would cost me more to get a lawyer and fight it than it is worth. I think they count on that, and more or less that is what their policy has written into it. Everything they said is false advertising.
They should be shot down! Great Expectations has been the absolute worst, most expensive, and thoroughly disappointing experience I have ever had the misfortune of living through. I desire all of my money back, my photos and video removed from their unprofessional website and a written apology, at least as flashy as the bunch of lies they call their presentation.
Thanks in advance for your help.

Great Expectation, you can find love

However, after about a month I was fed up with the sales tactics (the director permitted a mentally challenged man to become a member. Legally he was not of sound mind so he could not legally agree to the contract. However his mother was more than willing to pay over $5000 for him to become a member.)
SO I JOINED THE MEMBERSHIP SERVICES DEPARTMENT. I was so happy there. I got to match people, make the videos, help with profiles. Great Expectations could be such a fantastic avenue for singles if the would just change their policies towards employees to signup EVERY person who comes thru the door. But these money hungry owners and center directors ruin it for all.

« more RISD stories
01/23/2012
Illustration by Maira Kalman from Why We Broke Up, a collaboration with author Daniel Handler
“I knew I had to
break up with Ann Rosenberg after she chose a teal dress for the prom. I had
never heard of teal. Also, I was gay,” writes author/illustrator Brian Selznick 88
IL on the back cover of Why We
Broke Up by author Daniel Handler
and illustrator Maira Kalman, who
spoke at RISD last week.
Why We Broke Up, the cover of which forgoes
the usual accolades for stories of literary celebrity breakups, is itself both
the story of a breakup (that of high school students Ed and Min) and one of
collaboration. Handler, who also writes under the name Lemony Snicket, is author
of the 13-volume Series of Unfortunate
Events, while Kalman is best known for her contributions to The New
Yorker (including the knock-out “New Yorkistan” cover from 2001) as well as
her many children’s books. The event, sponsored by RISD's Division of Fine Arts, brought the two storytellers to RISD to talk about their creative
process with high school participants in RISD’s Project
Open Door after-school program and the RISD Museum teen program, as well as the broader RISD community.
“You don’t want to get published,” Handler
advised a student who asked for tips on launching a literary career. “Just be a
writer first. Read things you love over and over again and steal as much as you
can. Also, read lots of poetry, even if you don’t want to be a poet.”
Even before embarking on 13 Words,
their first book together (Why We Broke
Up is their second), Kalman would send Handler a picture she drew or found
and he would write a micro-story about it, and send it back. Though Handler and
Kalman live on opposite coasts, their easy rapport, deadpan humor and shared
love of Nabokov felt like, “two people who are having a conversation about
everything in the world.”
For this project, Handler asked Kalman what she’d like to paint. When she
showed him pictures of small ordinary objects – combs, onion rings, ticket
stubs and other ephemera – he built a storyline around them. In the book, Min
gives Ed a box containing artifacts from their relationship – bottle caps,
movie stubs and a protractor – accompanied by a long, book-length letter
explaining why they broke up.
“A lot of the images came first,” says Kalman. “I think of myself as a wandering journalist. I jot
down exactly what I see during the day that is really funny, really sad or
both. In this book, the dialogue of humor and heartbreak is contained both in images and in
words. We’re heartbroken and happy every 5 seconds.”
The authors are collecting more stories of heartbreak at their website,
the Why We Broke Up Project.
As the back cover notes, “Min and Ed’s story of heartbreak may remind you of
your own.”related links:Why We Broke Up ProjectProject

RIT graduate students earned second place in the final round during the third annual ERPSim Game hosted on the Internet by HEC Montreal. The online simulation tournament was held on June 20, and included 41 teams of students from 20 different universities.
The RIT team included Ucheagwu Okereke and Harshanand Pairla, who are pursuing MBA and M.S. degrees, respectively, from the E. Philip Saunders College of Business, and Surya Sheetal Saripalli, who is pursuing an MS degree in industrial engineering from the Kate Gleason College of Engineering.
ERPSim is a new method for teaching students the concepts and role of Enterprise Planning systems, which are in use by more than 90 percent of Fortune 1000 companies.
Saunders Management Information Systems faculty member James Baroody says, “A simulator operates a market in which the students’ company competes and they use real-time information to make business decisions.”

HPV and Gardasil
What is HPV?
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that will affect many people at some point in their lives. HPV has multiple subtypes, many of which are essentially harmless, don’t cause significant problems and resolve on their own. Some subtypes cause genital warts-unsightly growths that can appear on the penis, scrotum, anus, vagina or labia. These types do not carry the risk of turning into cancer. Other subtypes do not cause visible lesions but can cause changes in the cells of a woman’s cervix. Within that subtype are some that are considered “higher risk” for leading to cervical cancer.
How do you get HPV?
HPV is easily transmitted by direct contact with an infected person, usually during sexual activity involving genital contact. Any kind of unprotected sexual contact can put a person at risk—it is not necessary to have intercourse to be exposed to the virus.
How common is HPV?
HPV infection is much more common than people realize. In 2005-2006, more than 20 million Americans had genital HPV. Every year more than six million new cases are diagnosed in the U.S. Most people do not know they have the virus. Approximately 90% of infected persons have no symptoms and unknowingly pass it on their partners.
Is there a test for HPV?
Genital warts are usually diagnosed on the basis of their appearance. Higher risk types can be detected by a Pap test, a microscopic examination of the cervical cells that may reveal abnormalities characteristic of HPV infection. Testing can be done to see if the changes are caused by a subtype with a higher risk of leading to cancer.
What about Gardasil?
Gardasil is a vaccine that protects men and women against four different subtypes of HPV. Two of these types, HPV 11 and 6, cause 90% of all genital warts. The other two types, HPV 16 and 18, cause approximately 70% of all cervical cancers. Gardasil is approved for men and women ages 9-26. The best time to get Gardasil is before exposure to the virus, which is why it is recommended that people get the vaccine before the onset of sexual activity.
How is it given?
The vaccine is administered by injection (shot) and is given in three doses over six months on the following schedule: dose #1 followed by dose #2 two months later and ending with dose #3, six months after the first one. The injection is given in the upper arm muscle. Side effects are generally mild and may include pain, itching and redness at the injection site, mild fever and possibly nausea or dizziness.
Does the Health Center offer Gardasil?
Yes. The SHC offers Gardasil at $135 per dose, payable by cash, check or TigerBucks. You will need an appointment for the first dose. We can give you a receipt to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement, if applicable. Please check your insurance coverage first to be sure you will be reimbursed for immunizations given at the SHC.
Another option is to make an appointment to obtain a prescription for the vaccine to be purchased at an outside pharmacy. You may then bring the vaccine to the SHC for administration. For full time students this service is covered under your Student Health Fee. Part time, graduate and coop students may pay a visit fee for service.
If you started the series elsewhere and want/need to get a dose while at school to stay on schedule, please bring documentation of previous doses (with the date(s) given and a health care provider’s signature) to your appointment, or ask your health care provider to fax it to us at (585) 475-7788. We will not give a dose without this documentation.
For additional questions or concerns, please call or stop by the SHC and ask to speak to a provider.
For more information, please see the CDC HPV Vaccine Questions and Answers.

Thousands of pet owners work all day, and this requires leaving their dog home alone all day. Often these owners come home to a lonely dog with excessive energy waiting to be released. As dog owners ourselves, we feel that doggy daycares are an excellent alternative to keeping our dogs cooped up at home alone all day. So, we created a clean, safe, cage-free, outdoor-like facility for dog owners to keep their furry family member while they go off to work.
We are a fully-staffed facility that provides indoor and outdoor activities for your dog. As we provide several hours of stimulating activities every morning and afternoon for your canine, we also understand the need to have ample rest time throughout day. Certain times of the day we provide music for entertainment. Depending on both your dog's activity level and temperament, he may enjoy his day by playing with other dogs, playing with people, or just whiling away the hours curled up on somebody's lap.
Our staff is trained to deal with any outbreak of aggression that might arise, and we have a standing agreement with a local veterinarian should an emergency arise.
Where do you feel more comfortable leaving your precious pooch? Where do you feel your dog will be most comfortable and happy? Bring your dog to the Ritz and we know he will want to come back – Ruff Ruff!

Park’s ad does well, at least for me, in eliciting sympathy through the imagery, as she looks out the window towards her and the country’s bright future.
As for Moon’s I especially like the one fade-in of him napping in his easy chair –that’s real stuff…unlike most American ads where the candidate has to constantly be dashing about, with sleeves rolled up just below the elbow “gettin’ things done!”
Good stuff.
This is a total homer comment (obviously), but I absolutely love the way MJI’s ad closes:
“The opportunities will be equal;
The process will be fair;
The result will be just.”
Wow… Speechless.
Where’s Karl Rove when you need him?
“죽음의 문턱”? At death’s door? 오움마이갓!
I dislike both by default since they are political adds. But if I were to dislike one less, it would MJI’s. I like the realism of having a woman taking care of her man while he is passed out in a homey environment with tissue boxes etc. Plus I have this image of him clipping his toenails before his nap – just like a real person. PGH’s could just as easily be selling life insurance or skin cream. ACS’s would have been far more interesting – perhaps him as a TRON-like entity chasing down computer viruses.
dinkus, the ACS line, very funny.
Thanks for posting these. I wasn’t able to understand anything being said, but the visual style was really interesting; especially compared to the US ads which focus on making things as scary as possible.
Btw, what happened to Park Geun-hye? Was she cut in the face by an opposition supporter?
Sympathize with me and where I want to take the country versus I am a man of people, I will do your bidding. Miss Park ought to have been sipping some ginseng tea in the commercial. Moon ought to have been woken up with his grandkids jumping up on him. (Does he have grandkids?) Moon wins in the first of the CF installments.
I dislike them both.
Showcasing the slashing incident seems exploitative and weird..
Per #9,
Bingo.
Yes they most certainly will. The angle I had put on me from more than a few Korean ladies was “I would trust a woman sooner than a man, seeing how they screw everything up” or “I already contend with one penis. Must I endure another?”
More like a deranged maniac, but yes, it was a pretty big deal.
Nope. Moon is only 59 years old and his children (one daughter, one son) are not married.
Never could understand the idea that PGH’s election will be somehow good for women. How can the message be anything other than, “unless you happen to be the daughter of a president/dictator, you are screwed as a Korean woman”? India and Pakistan had women leaders (both insiders of the power structure, just like PGH,) long before United States did. Do people think even for a second that Indira Gandhi and Benazir Bhutto made India and Pakistan better places for women than the U.S.?
I am all for a woman president. Just not this one.
Since I’m pulling for Moon — and thus couldn’t care less how Park’s handlers shape her media campaign — let me offer some unsolicited advise to the PDs who created that gawd-awful Moon TV spot:
1. Lose the barefoot-hippie-at-home imagery. There is nothing presidential about it.
2. Drop the afternoon-nap imagery. Your candidate is fucking ex-Special Forces, for Christ’s sake. Think “vigorous.” This guy’s the next leader of the fourth largest economy in Asia. He’s not running for the deanship of the economics department of SNU.
And most importantly,
3. Drop the wife as hausfrau crap. Running to serve her man tea and ironing his pants (and while the dude enjoys an afternoon nap, of all things!) is degrading. Stupid, stupid, stupid.
C’mon, guys, get with the program. You’re supposed to be the progressives here.
DLB
PGH’s ad was OK . . . although I would stayed away from the slashing incident and focused more on what she plan’s on doing for the country.
The first 36 seconds of MJI’s video were borderline bizarre . . . the rest was excellent. However, I think the first half completely overshadowed the second half.
I give PGH a 5 on a 10 scale and MJI a 4 . . . in other words, two rather lame efforts . . . especially for something so important.
Both were rather odd. Don’t blame Moon for getting Moon So-ri to do a cover rather than getting Ahn Chi-hwan to sing his own damn song, though—not sure Ahn’s voice would have complimented that scene.
Really wish Park would have gone in a different direction. Seemed like something her brother would have directed in one of his more chemically enhanced moments.
I hope PGH wins. She’s been getting unfairly tarnished by associating her with her father. We don’t choose our parents, and even if they have flaws its natural to still see the good in them.
Moon, on the other hand, DID choose to associate himself with Roh, and for that he should lose. Moon comes across to me as a slimebag, and he will follow in the footsteps of the worst president in ROK’s short democratic history.
I too thought Moon’s ad was horribly sexist. Hopefully it alienates enough women to casuse him to lose.

#17, the Korea Times? Seriously?
Park was priviliged, for a kid that lost her parents in violent and shocking ways. Yes, it was all roses for her.
Bingo!
Normal people aren’t offended by portrayals of housewives acting like housewives. People who are offended have something wrong with themselves or hold some sort of animus against the population being portrayed.
When the other candidate is a woman and has been criticized for not being married (and therefore not being a real woman), then there is bound to be additional layers of meaning to the imagery, ecw.
Good observation, Salaryman.
The funy thing is that the ones who are attacking PGH most viciously on this point of her not being married are the progressive slimeballs. In Korea, progressive actually really means xenophobic, pro-Nork and extremely misogynistic. There is no doubt in my mind that Moon’s camp chose this imagery of the subserviant little housewife tending to the barefooted little pencil-neckied dweeb’s every little whim on purpose as an attack on PGH’s marital status and her fitness to be president based on her gender. No doubt whatsoever.
Thankfully, the morons of this thread cannot vote in Korea. So keep talking…
You are right, but we can influence those who can vote. Same thing.
Glad to see you agree with my assessment that you are a moron.
That was a weak one, dork. Back to Moon, someone asked why his history as a “special forces commando” wasnt used and the answer is that he could never pull it off today. Google his photos frm those days, he looked ridiculous then and it would be even more ridiculous to pass this effette off as a former commando.
SalarymaninSeoul — Which photos are you looking at? I Googled Moon Jae-In + “army” and found a passel of current-looking photos where he seems to be posing in an army uniform at an “old boys day” event, and a few old photos of a young-looking Moon in utilities where the guy looks awfully rugged.
I still dread the prospect of this guy being elected, and all the sugarplums he plans to give away with money stolen from me, but I wouldn’t denigrate his experience in the army.
I probably saw the same photos as you. I also saw some photos of this guy back when he was actually in the army. He does not look rugged in those photos and surely does not look rugged today. What exactly is this guy’s experience in the army? Did he see any action?
But you are right, whatever this guy’s army experience was, it does not change the fact that he wants the job as Thief of State, handing out goodies he steals from others.
I don’t think this sort of thing would be immune to attack if the opposing candidate were a man. These days you have to basically convert to Islam to have some degree of immunity against charges of “heteronormativity” or whatever they’re calling it.
Korea’s Left does seem to be nationalist and populist. This actually isn’t unusual though. Traditionally, the Left has often been associated with nationalism and populism. This sort of Leftist populist nationalism still exists to a certain extent in Europe. But it was only relatively recently that the Left in the West decided to throw native working-classes under the bus and turn away from populism and nationalism and towards championing other identities such as women, minorities, gays, etc.
I’m not a huge Moon Jae-in fan—mostly on account of his former boss—but really, “effete?” Seriously?
Seriously
We’re talking about about the same Moon Jae-in, right?
PS: I believe he was involved in Operation Paul Bunyan. Which would suggest he’s a very tough guy.
Yes, him. Who else? And from what I read he was not involved in that operation.
So Park Geun-Hye is saying that plastic surgery can save Korea, and Moon Jae-In likes to get drunk in the daytime and take his shoes off. What else is new?
I have a couple of observations:
1. MJI served and served honorably. In my mind his military service is off the table for criticism and on the table if he wishes to use it.
2. In a similar vein, PGH was slashed by a deranged progressive. She can’t hide it from her face, if she wants to address it then she is more than entititled.
3. MJI is tainted by association with super crook and coward NMH. He chose to be associated with that loser and still supports many of his policies.
4. PGH didn’t pick her family, it is pretty tenous to attribute all the bad and none of the good her father did. If you are going to do it then you need to take both and it’s pretty hard for any child to disown their parents.
5. I had no idea that the Korean could not vote in Korea.
Im not criticizing his service, all I am saying is that to somehow claim hes a tough guy commando is a serious stretch.
I agree with all the rest.
If there’s no picture of the guy doing silly things barechested in the snow with his mates then his Special Ops service doesn’t count.
Mr. Mun’s commercial is terrible, but he’s ready to knock off five attackers, one for each of his little pigglely-wiggleys.
Brendon, I’d say he looks like a pretty tough little guy in this pic.
That’s the photo I referenced. I’m flabbergasted at “effete”. Who says so? Chuck Norris?
I think even a Super Junior member could call him effette. Funny, thats one of the photos I saw when I first called him effette
@43 Salman, I understand that English is not your first language, but “effete” does not mean what you think it does and you probably looked at the antonym rather than synonym list in the thesaurus.
Well, that or you allow your absolutist positions on everything to cloud your judgment so that someone who holds different positions from yours cannot have any other good qualities. He’s liberal? His military service must be all photo op and no substance.
Anyone here who has military service can tell you that the military, particularly commando teams, don’t give out participation trophies. I have no doubt he earned his military stripes, regardless of whatever else he has done or ideas he holds.
You weaken any part of your argument that relies on subjective analysis or conclusion making with your obvious inability to see the objective for what it is.
See National Defense Service Medal.
Good job, BC.
We’re even now, OK?
hmm fascinating..
The wife of MJI’s portrayal of “The Good Wife” must be a much repeated mantra…

Sign The E-petition Against Cuts To Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.
If they are successful, there will be less money to go around people who are injured by criminals, including those who are attacked at work and the children of murder victims. The government’s own assessment of its proposals admits that 60% of those entitled to compensation under the current scheme would lose their entitlement. The government is seeking to push these changes through the House of Commons by 22nd October and they also have to be approved by the House of Lords.
RMT has tabled an E-petition calling for these cuts to be stopped. If we get 100,000 signatures we will have a chance of blocking these outrageous plans again and I urge you to go to the following web address and sign the petition.
Please encourage your family, friends and workmates to sign this petition, as soon as possible.

Ladycopa .... I wish I knew more about how one won't work the one burner she prob going to be using at any given time? I live in a mobile home and have 100 lb tank running my stove in house. I know when temp dipps at night sometimes gas won't work. Could you help me understand why a bit better. I see trucks all over up here with like two 30 or 40s I've seen guys running stove like mine with 20s.

Website design ‘key to PR’
Firms hoping to expand their online presence should note that an effective press area is one vital facet of website design, an expert has highlighted.
In his Alertbox column, website usability specialist Jakob Nielsen has underlined the importance of including a section dedicated to company news and press releases.
An easily accessed area making it simple for journalists to source stories is seen as vital by Mr Nielsen.
He advised: ‘We strongly recommend that PR areas have links to external sources, including press coverage; journalists often consider articles from independent newspapers and magazines to be much more credible than a company’s own press releases.’

Routes : North America : United States : California : Joshua Tree National Park : Lost Horse : Lost Horse Wall : Bird on a Wire
Bird on a Wire - 5.10a
Route sequence (left to right): 14
Route Summary | Ascent Notes (44)
Premier Sponsor:
Description:Excellent three-pitch climb; can be done in two. More so face climbing with good crack pro. A short first pitch leads up to spacious belay ledge. Possible to belay there or continue on. Second pitch starts up crack that leads up to the black patina plates, then to the prominent right arching thin crack that has a long section previously protectable only by stoppers that gave the name to the route (if you fall you fly like a bird), passing two closely placed bolts. Set belay near or above the end of the right arching crack. Try not to cris-cross with parties on The Swift to the left or on Dappled Mare to the right. Two or three possible ways to continue to the top, all rated about the same. Just pick one that wouldn't lead to crossing ropes with other parties.
Note: Originally, there was only 1 bolt protecting the crux, which has since been replaced, along with the addition of a slightly higher bolt placed without consent of the FA party. If you choose to belay at the two closely spaced bolts, be aware of the sparse pro at the start of the resulting next pitch and a possible factor 2 fall or a fall directly onto the belayer.
Descent Options:Walk off to climber's right down main gully.

Bird on a Wire
Great route. Combined with Dappled Mare for two laps on the wall before finishing off a short winter day back at Intersection Rock. Very warm south facing wall. Second pitch is awesome. Crux is a shallow finger crack right above an intermittent belay that I passed up to set up a gear belay when it intersected Dappled Mare. I prefer the right crack towards the top for the finish. Makes for another decent pitch that way. With Joe K.

Soft for grade
If you can climb at the grade, don't bother roping up for the first "pitch", flip flops and gear still in our bags was fine
Added: 2011-10-23
Sweet Moves
Way soft but really fun climbing. I would say the bolted belay is in a great place for taking falls on your belayer. If you belay from the large ledge after the arching crack and then lead to where the to cracks converge about 50 feet above the bolted belay you can avoid a factor 2 and I think it splits up better that way. Watched a guy take a good size whipper after the crux and almost land on his belayer. Soft for the grade.

Thanks, I will give it a go. I've been wanting to try a flag capture by jumping of a Grav cycle. Saw it done the other day..very cool.

Is it just me, or are cappers, chasers, and HoFs in short supply in pub games? I play light defense soldier myself, and those are the roles that I usually find lacking on my team.
Being new to Tribes, I have to ask: what does HoF mean?
Sidenote: Also, what is it with gaming communities and ridiculous, impenetrable acronyms?

Like a bug on a windshield...
I've not played enough of Ascend to get any of the neat classes, but I tend to break into the enemy base as a Soldier, take down their Genny, then resist all attempts for it be repaired. I'd like to think of myself as a capture enabler.

The HoF is basically the goalkeeper of Tribes. Best used with the Super Heavy Perk.

Goalkeeper's a really good analogy, actually.
Doesn't make me hate the bastards any less when there's three of them, all with shields, backed up by a small army of Techs with their turrets, though.
I know as an Infiltrator/Pathfinder they're my natural foil and all, but I think those turrets need their rate of fire or damage, or maybe line of sight cutting right now. When you have a couple next to each other they cover their blindspots so efficiently its practically impossible to take one down without the other finishing you off. Frustrating when you're speciality's supposed to be disabling base defenses.
I did kill him in 1v1 a few times though, after i suicided into him countless lives that is.

The problem is that the reach perk completely negates the HoF. I hope they nerf or better completely remove it soon.

I'm really pleased to see there's so much interest in tribes over here on RPS, I'll gladly join the next time we get a game going together (if indeed that's possible with the current state of the friend/server joining system)
Just played a game and we had 6, (six!) Techs guarding our generator room. Needless to say we didn't do much flag capturing.
Tell me - is rolling a Juggernaut and endlessly volleying grenade rounds down onto the enemy base from great heights a legitimate strategy? Or is this akin to camping in a game of CS? It's just that it feels so right...yet it feels so wrong.
The ting say there be bad guys, I hope it right.
More than four techs in one place is a headache on almost any map just because taking out that many turrets while all the other turrets are simultaneously shooting you is next to impossible. Definitely should score some points or get a kill credit or something for taking those little bastards out.
I'd say raining hell down on the base is cool. Just don't let me catch you standing next to an ammo station in the basement and constantly blindfiring at the doorways. Two Juggernauts doing that can seal off most gen rooms with next to no way of getting in. If they have even a single tech turret supporting them then its even worse, as it'll stop Infiltrators from recloaking if they decide to take a shot.
For the record, I'd also like to register a vote for Rock Paper Shazbot and make sure all credit goes to the guy who called it first back in my other thread.
How about we make the RPS Steam group Rock, Paper, Shazbot and keep the name of this thread Rock, Paper, Spinfusor?
Since juggernauts have no means of aiming besides good old trial and error, it's hardly cheesy. Not to mention that you will be constantly murdered by pathfinders with their ridiculous bolters.

I JUST LOVE THESE SHOES OMG!! I am in love with these shoes. This is my first time purchasing Rockport and it will not be my last. This shoe looks like a million bucks. I cannot wait to wear them out. The sole of this shoe is out of this world. I'm not a shoe person, but THIS shoe will turn some heads. My husband even gave me a compliment on how good they look with jeans. That says a lot because we usually don't have the same taste. January 10, 2013

M is VERY VERY small wide! you should warn the buyer December 22, 2012
Unwearable I have had, and loved previous dressports. I tried to replace with the same size and found them much too narrow. I ordered another pair in extra wide and they are still too narrow to wear. December 16, 2012
Excellent. product. Hopefully I will never need to buy a pair in the near future. Once that "near future" passes, I will return to Rockport. November 11,.

Savoy Brown and Them Changes
Jim Esposito, Rock Magazine, November 1972
2012 NOTE: I was young, probably a bit too much of a fan, and just looking to do a superficial, light-hearted story, but we now know why Savoy Brown went through so many people. The band was managed by Kim's brother, Harry, and everybody else were simply hired help. Kim and Harry controlled the finances, and probably ended up with most of the money. One interesting sidebar to this piece: the drummer who held the record for the shortest tenure in the band (at that time) never made it through his first rehearsal. They told him to do a blues shuffle and he said: "Huh?" Did not know what they were talking about. "He couldn't do a blues shuffle," I remember somebody telling me, "so we fired him." This is going back a-ways, and I want to say it was Harry Simmonds telling me the story. At any rate, according to my source, this drummer later rose to prominence in the Yes, where an unfamiliarity with the blues shuffle apparently was not much of a liability. JE

The Poolside Pronouncements Of Johnny 'No-Tan' Rotten
Chris Salewicz, NME, 18 March 1978
JOHN ROTTEN likes dressing up. Seeing him stuck away under a parasol by the side of the Olympic-sized pool of the Kingston Sheraton at eleven in the morning slurping Red Stripe from the bottle, his outlaw chic appears impeccable.

Rodman Public Library invites teens ages 13-18 to learn about the mysterious creatures that may live among us. Do creatures like Big Foot and Loch Ness exist? Or can science explain them?
The program will examine Big Foot, Cupacabra, Bessie the Lake Erie monster and other creatures spotted and reported. Also examined, animals that were thought to be extinct but have been found.
Lynette Reiner, an expert from the McKinley Museum, will visit Rodman Library on Thursday, June 21, to present the program. Reiner is the Science Director at the William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum. She graduated from the University of Akron with a Bachelor’s of arts degree in history and a minor in interdisciplinary anthropology. Reiner volunteered at the Akron Zoo as an animal interpreter and also taught hands-on science activities to children and adults.
No registration is needed. This is a free event and will take place at 3 p.m. in the Main Library auditorium. For more information, call 330-821-2665, ext. 214.

Rolf Wallin:
ning
(1995)
for oboe/english horn, violin, viola, and cello.
One of these forces is a cohesive, joining force called ning. In my oboe quartet, the four instruments act very much like fish or birds in a group, sometimes moving fast and close to eachother, with one clear direction, then all of a sudden the group dissolves to four separate individuals, finding their own paths within a wider area, but still dependent on oneanother. Ning is the fourth in a series of pieces where I use socalled fractal mathematics in the prosess of composition.

Rollins is embarking on a campus-wide Student Success initiative led by Interim Provost Laurie M. Joyner, Ph.D., and Dean of Admission David Erdmann to strengthen the academic experiences, success, and persistence of our students.
Earlier this fall, a Student Success campus-wide survey was administered to gain feedback on areas that have a high likelihood of contributing to greater student success at Rollins. Seven priorities were identified from the survey as well as from a review of national retention literature. Work groups focusing on each of the seven priorities will develop action items for consideration by the Student Success and Retention Task Force.
The work groups that emerged as high priorities include Academic Advising, Healthy Behaviors/Campus Culture, High Impact Practices, Instructional Excellence/Student-Faculty Connections, Student Recruitment and Financial Aid, Student Success after Graduation, and Research and Discovery. Faculty and staff have been chosen to serve as members of these work groups and students will be asked to participate to ensure an inclusive and collaborative effort focused on continuous improvement.
“As we proceed with this initiative, the Task Force is being charged with developing a college-wide strategic agenda for student success and retention,” said Interim Provost Joyner. “In the coming months, college-wide meetings and updates will be announced as we move towards strengthening student engagement, satisfaction, success, and retention at Rollins.”

Castrensian Amphitheatre
The Castrensian Amphitheatre was a modest amphitheatre of the 2nd century AD in which games were probably staged for soldiers. (The camp of the imperial horseguard was close to the site.)
In the 3rd century it was incorporated into the Aurelian Wall with the arches lying beyond the wall being filled in. On the picture below and on the picture of the model, you should just be able to make out the filled in arches.

How Java Garbage Collector Work–A Simple Note
Recently I was asked about how Java Garbage Collector works. I remember I learned about it a few years ago, but seldom need to consider it in my development. (I simply follow the rules of set the reference to null when I’m done with the object.) So I didn’t figure it out.
Today I [...]
Recently I wrote some program in Python, which dumps data into a pickle file. The file data is loaded into memory by another Python program for further processing. This works pretty well until I need to write a Java program which also loads the data saved in the pickle file.
I searched around but [...]
Switch Between Main Classes in a Jar File
Many developers used to write a main function for every class that can be tested separately. When we export it as a jar file, we usually specify a main class for execution of the jar file. Running this jar file is straightforward,

But from time to time, some bugs are [...]
My Java Tools/Libraries List

While the congressman did not address rampant speculations about a potential 2012 run for the presidency, he emphatically stated that the liberty movement will not need an electoral majority in order to achieve important changes for the better. The welfare state, the police state and the runaway fiat money system will be defeated if each of us assumes personal responsibility for promoting the ideals of liberty and defending the Constitution.

- The Texas Tribune: Ron Paul at CPAC: “Too Much Bipartisanship”
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside, gave a rollicking speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington — one peppered with cheers and jeers. His target? The “bipartisanship” that leads to foreign and financial policies he argues curb the country’s liberty.
“We’ve had way too much bipartisanship for about 60 years. We have bipartisanship on medical care,” Paul said. “It’s the bipartisanship of the welfare system, the warfare system, the monetary system. It all goes through with support from both parties.”

The Republican party’s most serious potential presidential contenders at the Conservative Political Action Conference today gave little more than passing reference to the most serious news of the day – the resignation of Egyptian’s authoritarian President Honsi Mubarak.
Yet Rep. Ron Paul — who’s arguably the most popular politician at the annual conservative conference, but not considered a viable presidential candidate — seized the news to blast American foreign policy and promote his well-known preference for isolationism.
- Dallas News: Texas Rep. Ron Paul gets cheers at conservative conference, remains mum about Senate, presidential ambitions
Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who has dropped hints in recent weeks that he is pondering bids next year for either president or the Senate, kept ’em guessing Friday afternoon at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
He said nothing about his ambitions even as he basked in his role as herald of the 2010 tea party surge, and father of tea party-backed freshman Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.
“I’m glad to see the revolution is continuing!” Paul proclaimed, playing on his slogan from the 2008 presidential campaign.

- Washington Examiner: Ron Paul on Egypt: ‘What should our position be on finding the next dictator?’
Speaking at CPAC today, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Tex., went straight for the issue that has been blowing up all over the wire: Egypt, and America’s role in preserving its thirty-year dictatorship until today.
The 75 year old delivered an energetic speech to the main room of CPAC today rhetorically asking “What should our position be on finding the next dictator in Egypt?” His solution, of course: “We need to do a lot less, a lot sooner, not only in Egypt but around the world.”
- NPR: Ron Paul Says U.S. ‘Propped Up’ Mubarak And Wasted Aid to Egypt
As the rest of the world reacted to the announced departure of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Friday, one would-be Republican presidential candidate after another declined to address it here at the CPAC gathering.
Then came Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), whose Libertarian positions have made him a favorite at the Conservative Political Action Conference and won him the group’s presidential straw poll last year.
- FoxNews.com: Ron Paul Brings Down the House at CPAC
If anything can be gauged by applause in main ballroom, Ron Paul will once again win the Presidential Straw Poll here at CPAC.
Paul won the contest last year, much to the chagrin of many of the party faithful who attended.
This year Paul was the only potential presidential candidate to directly tackle the tricky subject of Egypt.
- New American: Ron Paul Delivers CPAC Address
Texas Congressman Ron Paul delivered his impassioned CPAC address today to an energetic crowd of Republicans, Constitutionalists, and Libertarians. Paul’s speech stayed true to his Libertarian, non-interventionist, pro-Constitution beliefs, drawing applause from paleo-conservatives and ire from some neoconservatives.
Paul’s supporters have made their presence well-known throughout this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, at times chanting his name during other seminars or bombarding CPAC attendees with Paul memorabilia.
Today’s crowd was full of Paul’s supporters, who gave a total of nine standing ovations throughout Paul’s speech.
- Raw Story: Ron Paul: ‘Government is in the process of failing’
Is he running for US Senate? Is he signaling his bid for US president? Or is he hinting at something deeper within the US political climate?
Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) sounded like he was about to hit the campaign trail again during his speech at a right-wing forum Friday, but before he left the podium, he warned Americans that their federal government was in trouble.
“Tragically, you’re going to have the opportunity [to not ask the federal government for anything], because government is in the process of failing, and they can’t deliver on the goods, just as the Soviets couldn’t deliver the goods and maintain their own power,” he said during the Conservative Political Action Conference.
- Daily Caller: Ron Paul calls for end to foreign aid, applauds House for not extending PATRIOT Act
Rep. Ron Paul, Texas Republican, got the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) crowd’s biggest and most animated reaction of any speaker at the event – and took the stage saying: “I’m glad to see the revolution is continuing.” Paul applauded new House freshmen GOP members for blocking the extension of the PATRIOT Act.
“The PATRIOT Act is literally destruction of Fourth Amendment,” Paul said. “In Washington, they don’t know what’s going on in grassroots America because they assumed everybody loved the PATRIOT Act.”

Ron Paul: Thank you very much. It’s so nice to see you, I thought you would be all worn out from the campaign, but it’s great to see you here. The campaign continues, the campaigning for liberty will last a long time. Somebody that campaigns with me, and has for a long time, is my wife, Carol, sitting over here. But it is a delight to see an enthusiastic crowd, I’m delighted you’re here tonight, and this week, and are being involved in the Campaign for Liberty. Because, in many ways, that’s what all of us are doing and what I’ve done for a few years. And since we started this organization 4 or 5 years ago, I got to name it, and I thought, “Well, why don’t we call it something that I’ve been doing: ‘Campaign for Liberty’, that’s what we’ll call it, that is it. So that type of campaign goes on for a long time until we win, and since the world is imperfect, we’ll never have perfect liberty. But if we don’t campaign for liberty, the other side is going to keep campaigning for stateism and big government, and they are our enemy and we must stop them. Probably the best success we’ve had with the Campaign for Liberty has been the grassroots effort the Campaign for Liberty has done on making sure that we got the bill to audit the Federal Reserve System at least passed in the House of Representatives. But not only about getting the legislation passed in House, and who knows, we might still get the rest of it done in the Senate, but we don’t know. But the more important thing is calling attention to the American people to the issue of monetary policy. They’re never going to put that back in the bottle, let me tell you. The people now know the importance of the monetary policy and the Federal Reserve, thank you for all your hard work and effort on that.
Ron Paul: Really, liberty is the issue, because if you understand liberty, you can apply it to everything, whether it’s civil liberty, foreign policy, monetary policy, or economic policy, it’s all very much the same. But, in order to understand how the system works, you have to understand the monetary system, because big government can’t exist without a Federal Reserve, it just wouldn’t happen. Because Congress would have to pay their bills, and with the Federal Reserve, they’re able to deceive the people, pretend that they’re not being harmful and delay their payment, and that’s what this is all about. Now, Bernanke, this weekend as usual – and as all the Federal Reserve Chairmen that I have met always say when they get into trouble and they can’t seem to get out – said, “Well, Congress has to do more”. Of course, they shouldn’t do more, they should do a lot less, that’s what they need to do. But it isn’t the Fed against the Congress, or the Congress against the Fed. The Congress created the Fed, and you know what, they can get rid of the Fed if they want to, and they should. But if there are special interest groups, as there certainly are in this country, that support the warmongering going on and the military-industrial complex, and if they had to tax the American people to pay all the bills for all the wars, just think in the last ten years, the national debt went up over 4 trillion dollars just for the wars that we have been fighting in the Middle East. And just look at the disaster in the Middle East today, 11 country embassies being demonstrated against with violence against Americans because, for some reason, they don’t like us dropping drone missiles on their countries. But this expenditure couldn’t happen, and wars couldn’t be fought if we had honest money, because the people would have to be that taxed and they would rebel and say it’s a bad investment. But it is so deceitful, and they can delay the inevitable for a long time, but that long time is coming to an end, and that’s why our work is so important right now. We have to keep plugging ahead.
The same is true about domestic welfare spending, if we paid all the bills, the people would rebel and everybody would know how much it’s costing. But if you can run up the deficits, there is an absolute agreement that the Fed is going to monetize it, they’re going to buy the debt. If not, what happens, interest rates go up. Well, they can borrow for a while, but there’re not enough lenders out there, so interest rates would be higher, and this would be hard for the economy. But then all the pressure would be on the people and the Congress to cut the spending and let the people spend the money, not the government. If you look at our history, up until 1913, it was far from perfect, but the size of government didn’t have steady growth. And it was the inevitably bad year or 1913 that changed our history so dramatically: bringing in the Federal Reserve, changing the foreign policy that said that we’re going to make the world safe for democracy. They said we’ll have to fight one more war to end all wars, and you know how well that has worked out, and created and income tax. And just think of the last past 100 years. But as I have tried to say so many times and I certainly tried to point it out in Tampa, it’s all coming to an end and we should be grateful that it’s coming to an end. So the question isn’t so much about will the Keynesian, socialism, welfareism and interventionism end, it’s how it’s going to end and how many people are going to be prepared, how many of us will be out there, how many will then argue the case for sound money and personal liberty and economic liberty and a sensible foreign policy? That is what we have to have out there. Now, as I suggested in the campaign, there is no reason why we can’t have a transition. We can move from one to another, we can turn down the spigots of spending and bring our troops home and just cut back on spending and just work our way out of this. The odds aren’t very good that that’s going to happen, just this week there were efforts for a continuing resolution for 6 more months, and one thing is for sure, the party that’s in charge of the House of Representatives made sure that the military budget went up 26% on the continuing resolution.
See, this is the reason why I am unconvinced that we are going to keep doing the same thing over and over again. When are we going to see that the Fed is all of a sudden going to be a good manager? We saw what the Fed did this week, I mean, they’ve been trying for 5 years to bail out a system that collapsed because they spent too much, borrowed too much, printed too much. So what did they announce this week? They announced, “Well, what we need to do is we really need to print money, and we’ve tried QE1 and QE2, now we’re going to have perpetual QE. And now we’re going to give 40 billion new dollars every month”, which is nearly half a trillion dollars every year. And if necessary, they’ll increase it, they’ll guarantee low interest rates for another three years, and then they wonder why people don’t get their confidence restored and people get confused on what to do. Well, there’s one reason why they get confused, and that is the most important thing for individuals to make decisions on business and investments, and it’s the issue of interest rates. Because, in a market economy, if the people save money, they drive the interest rates down. And the business man says, “Oh, interest rates used to be 4%, they’re now at 2%, this is the time I should invest and rebuild”. So what happens if nobody saves any money and interest rates are 0%? Then you get real mal-investment, the money is printed, passed out to the banks for free, and they can put it back into reserves and get interest paid from the Federal Reserve. Or the banks themselves, or the Federal Reserve, buys debt, and there’s no incentive to go out and invest in a risky economy because the more the Congress interferes by passing more laws and not knowing what the tax code will be, passing socialized medical programs and on and on, people don’t have their confidence restored. So this is the reason that we are going to go on like this, we do not know when it will end. It could end soon, it could end in a year or 2 or 3 years, who knows. But I believe we’re getting awfully close to this. Then, this is where our efforts have to pay off, because the campaign for liberty is actually trying to get more people to not only understand it, but at least not be hostile to freedom, because our answers can be found in freedom. Because, in so many other countries, when they have faced these crisis, they end up with dictators. And we have more dictatorial and authoritarian government than ever before. And now not only do they tell you what to smoke and drink and eat, but they’re telling you how big your coca-cola can be, how big a glass of coca-cola you can have. And it’s pretty absurd when you can’t drink raw milk and you can’t make rope out of hemp and if you have a serious medical condition that can be helped with marijuana, you get put in prison with your wheelchair and all. There’s something seriously wrong, I would say they don’t understand what liberty is all about.
But obviously you do, and that’s good and that’s the good news, and there are a lot more like you out there than you ever realize, a lot more than I ever dreamed of. Because I have often made the comment that I did do a little bit of speaking, I used to practice a lot of speaking because I would go to college campuses. I used to be able to get 30 or 40 people out in one group on a college campus, but now a few more come. Now, in the old days if you were running as a conservative Republican, you’d go to a conservative campus and you’d get a nice crowd on you and you’d get all the plusses and you’d say, “Hey, this is great”. But, if you went to Berkeley and you ended up getting a big crowd there, or even the University of Texas, you would say, “Hey, you’re in Austin, you better be careful”. But now, with the freedom movement, you can go to a conservative campus and get a large crowd out, and you can go to Berkeley and get a bigger crowd out. So, that makes my point: freedom brings people together, people who believe in freedom for different reasons should all come together. We should eliminate this whole concern about diversity, whether you want to spend your money or save your money, or waste your money, in free society, you can do it. But if you waste your money, don’t go to your neighbor and say, “You have to bail me out and you have to pay more taxes”, that’s what you can’t do. But it truly does bring people together, and that’s why I think it’s so magnificent about it. Not only on the money issue, we understand it on the religious issue. Americans are pretty good, except when they get angry at certain groups and they have to bash them and say, “They’re the cause of the war” and this kind of stuff. But, in religion, we have so many different religious beliefs and we have people. Guess what, in a free society, you’re even allowed to be an atheist, we don’t put you in prison for that. But it isn’t the point I want you to believe, it is the point that you’re allowed to believe. And the other important thing is that when you legalize freedom, whether it’s personal habits or economic habits, you don’t endorse what the people do, and that’s a big difference. A lot of people will come up to me and say, “Ron, I agree with you, this drug war is horrible, but I can’t endorse people doing those things to their bodies, we have to protect them from themselves”. And I would think, yea, politicians and bureaucrats know more about protecting you against yourself than they do themselves. That doesn’t work. This whole notion that we have to depend on the government to tell us what our habits should be … but if we allow people to make these decisions, in economics it’s easy, and socially and religiously, the First Amendment, it’s a philosophy of tolerance. But tolerance is not endorsement. If you get to keep all your own money, and you gamble it away and lose it, that doesn’t mean I endorse gambling. But, like I said, though, if you have a lifestyle that punishes yourself and you suffer from it, you cannot use force to be taken care of by other people, you have to suffer the consequences.
Not only should you suffer the consequences, you should also reap the benefits. What if you were frugal and you saved and you invested? You should be able to keep the fruits of your labor, and that’s why the income tax is morally wrong, you shouldn’t have an income tax. But in any society with the government that we have now and have been putting up with for so long is, instead of being the protector of private property, they destroy the concept of private property. Instead of protecting and enforcing contracts, they interfere with the contracts and put force on us and manipulate things. So they’re working perversely. You know, the constitution as well as the Coinage of 1792 says, “Don’t counterfeit”, it’s a serious offense. But what do we have, we have the Federal Reserve as the chief counterfeiter of the world. And then we have the Fed manipulating money and credit, we have people who still would like to take care of themselves: work hard, save some money, put it in the bank, earn some interest, maybe 0.5% or 1%. And Bernanke was on the air today recognizing this because he’s done it to me in the committee when I bring it up and I say, “Alright, somebody wants to save their money and they don’t want to take risks in the stock market and they want to earn a little interest and they don’t earn enough”. And he says, “Yes, but the health of the economy is more important than marking sure that everybody is taken care of. Some people will suffer”. So if you’re elderly or of a fixed income or you want to save and you can’t earn any interest – and the market rate of interest would be 5% or 6%, but that’s beside the point because ‘we have to help the economy’. Usually, the world ‘economy’ means banks and big corporations and politicians and governments and foreign interventions, that’s what it is, that’s why we have to attack this whole system. But the really good news is that a lot of people are hearing this message. You have helped to spread it, the internet spreads it, you have had numerous speakers here. You know, I was kidding the other day, but it is true that it used to be that voting by myself used to be a neat little event, at least I’d wave a flag and say, “Look here, you guys”. But now I have these guys like Justin Amash and other people that are voting with me and I can hardly be by myself at all.
And there are going to be some new people. It won’t be fast enough, we have to keep doing it, but setting a standard and setting a record is very, very good because people are watching and they will be encouraged. And this is why, no matter, we must get the good people in Congress, and they have to be perseverant and stick to their guns, we have to keep working with the Campaign for Liberty, we have to change people’s minds. Ideas do have consequences, bad ideas have bad consequences. So these things are powerful, powerful weapons that we have, and we have truth on our side, which makes a big difference. If freedom is the answer, and authoritarianism is something that has been around for thousands of years and has always failed and undermined personal liberty, then maybe we do have truth on our side. We just have to energize people, we have to get their confidence back. This is what has happened to the American people, they’ve lost confidence in true freedom. They say, “Freedom is good, that’s a good thing, but you have to give up some of it to be safe. How can you have a safety net and how can you be protected against the terrorist if we didn’t have TSA?” I think that’s a little bit confused thinking and I think more Americans are beginning to understand this. But private property would solve all those problems at the airport. The people who are supposed to provide the security are the airlines, not bureaucrats that belong to labor unions and everything else. We’ve not only given up on the idea of private property and contracts and sound money, but we’ve also been careless on allowing certain small groups of people talk to the American people into believing that if you don’t support the wars and you don’t support the troops, then and you’re un-American and you’re not patriotic. Guess what, the people in active military duty have spoken, they have been very vocal, and guess what? They support the cause of liberty and they supported our campaign and they said these wars are unnecessary and not beneficial.
And, of course, that’s a very good reason to just bring them home, and we could. I can’t understand the inability of us to convince more, because, to me, it seems so logical. If you’re out of money and the wars aren’t any good and they’re not constitutional; we’ve spent 4 trillion dollars we didn’t have, and we would have more peace and prosperity by having a foreign policy where we defend our country properly and constitutionally with the permission of the people through the Congress, instead of allowing the President and the United Nations and NATO to decide it. Why shouldn’t this be welcomed with open arms and say, “It’s time to bring them home”. So, the rule of law has been taken carelessly, we don’t really follow it, not many in the Congress really care about the constitution. They take the oath of office, but the worst part about it isn’t that they don’t follow the constitution, which is horrible, but they believe they’re following it. They’ve been rationalized by our education system that said, “It was never meant to be overly rigid, it has to be adaptable, we have to adapt it to modern times”. Even today, I was on an interview and we were talking about the economy and I said the economy was pretty good without a central bank back in the 19th century. And they said, “I don’t want to talk about that, that’s old fashioned, we don’t even want to go back to that”. But we do have to recognize that markets work and foreign policy works and going backwards is not the problem. What we want to do is pick up the pieces. We had a good system, we knew what we had. We have to quit doing the dumb things, because it’s so easy to figure out that we have to live within our means as individuals, and governments should have to do it and the politicians should be held responsible. But the big question is the question that always has to be asked, and for which you have to get the right answer, and that is, “What should the role of the government be?” And governments have been around for a long, long time, and governments always overstep. But, if the government would be what the constitution says it should be, it should be very limited to the protection of liberty. If you want more government, it should be local and not at the federal level, and certainly it shouldn’t be international, it shouldn’t be United Nations. But it’s been rationalized by the members of Congress and by the people, I certainly heard it and it really hurt to hear people so often say right after 9/11, “Well, it looks like we have to sacrifice our freedoms now to be safe”. The truth is, if you take an oath of office and you take an oath to be a president, you don’t swear an oath, “I’m going to keep the American people safe from here on out”. Matter of fact, if you say that, that means, “I am going to keep you safe and you’ll have no more liberty”, because that’s the only way you can be perfectly safe. So, no, you want to obey the law and you want to protect life and liberty and property and a judicial system and not much else. But we had given up on this a hundred years ago. But the magnificent story now is that, and it has been much more than I ever expected in these last 4, 5 years, there has been a tremendous surge in the interest of this. Just think that a whole new generation of young people right now are joining us. I mean, a lot of us have been fighting this for a long time and we’ve always been outnumbered. But if we can keep this energy going with the younger generation … and I’m not talking about the college graduates, I’m talking about the college student and the high school student, they know and understand this stuff. I get pretty impressed about high school students, one of them told me, “I’ve been reading about Mises and Rothbard”, and I hadn’t even heard those names until I got out of college”. But the people I meet from the younger generation are way ahead of anybody I ever met when I was in high school and college. But the needs are much greater, there was a lot of wealth left, there was a lot of momentum, and we’ve been consuming it for several decades now. There is no real wealth in this country, what you see as wealth, most of it is debt. The dollar functioned, but the dollar is debt, so it doesn’t have a real value. But, the trust in the dollar is still there, so there is always a subjective element on value, there’s still a thought around the world: “Well, the Americans have all the weapons and they have a lot of wealth, so we’re going to take their dollars” and that sort of thing. But, it could come to an end. Matter of fact, in the last 4 days since Bernanke announced this continuous QE, the dollar has gone down sharply. With this stuff going on over in the Middle East, as well as the oil prices going up, we could be getting pretty close to this. This stuff in the Middle East is really dramatized, I guess you’ve seen some of the maps on TV, they will paint each country in red that had some revolt or rebellion or demonstration against America in the last week, and there’re 11 countries right now. And they want to tell you these protests are because somebody in some place did a video that nobody has seen and nobody understands, and they say, “Oh, that’s why they hate Americans”. Well, guess what, it’s all in Arab countries that we have been taking over, we prop up the dictators, we’re on both sides of all those issues. We prop up dictators like in Egypt, give them billions and billions of dollars and pay them to be friends of Israel. And then, all of a sudden, the people rebel against that government, and so we participate in the overthrow of our puppet leader in Egypt and then somebody else comes in and, lo-and-behold, guess who’s in the rebellion, the Al-Qaida.
And the Al-Qaida is in Libya as well and they’re involved in Syria. They weren’t in Iraq, but they are now. I mean, the whole thing about the foreign policy makes no sense whatsoever, we spend all that money and we’re less safe. And that can get out of hand. There’s a lot of planning done on how to manage and spread our empire, and they don’t sit down and say, “Well, let’s have a world war”, but sometimes some of those plans get out of control. What I fear the most is a false flag; something happening where one of our ships goes down or a plane goes down, and, of course, it had to be the Iranians, for sure, for certain. But then, the emotions go high. But even today, when our ambassador was killed, there were are a lot of people ready to go to war over this and never asking the serious questions. But I am convinced that if we have a sensible foreign policy, we would have more friends in the world, and I think that is important. But the neo-cons are quick to criticize and say, “Well, Ron Paul just doesn’t understand, nor does he care about, this great thing called ‘American Exceptionalism’, that we are the greatest and the best and we can tell people what to do. We could be the greatest and we could be the best and we’ve had good traits in the past, but, the one thing that we as a people have come to realize, is that if we have good traits and we do a good job and have a good economy and have sound money and a sensible foreign policy and mind our own business, guess what, others might want to copy us, they might want to emulate us. But, right now, there’s not much effort in that. I am also concerned that if there’s a false flag and things break out, what’s going to happen is we’ll go bankrupt at the same time. And if you think the map of those 11 countries expressing their anger towards us is bad right now, I think there’re going to be a lot more who have been held in check because we’ve had weaponry and we’ve had money. And my complaint has always been that we’ve always only had two options on foreign policy, 1) You do what we tell you and we’ll give you a lot of money, or 2) if you don’t do it, we’re going to give you a lot of bombs.
Right now, we’re doing both to some of these countries, we’re shooting them and at the same time we’re giving them money. Why don’t we offer them this other approach based on the constitution and liberty: why don’t we offer them neither of those and just offer them friendship and trade and no money and no bombs, that’s what we need. One of the things that the freedom movement and Campaign for Liberty has being doing, is it’s being trying to get people to think of liberty as a whole, not in pieces. And liberty was chalked into pieces, and still today you have conservatives defending one part of it and liberals defending another part of it, and then it’s also mixed up by even the conservatives who might be pretty good on economics. If they get a president that’s not so conservative, they have to go along with him because it’s a partisan thing. And then, on the other side, you might have a president whose supposed to cut back on arresting people for marijuana and also have less wars, and he defies it. And then the democrats say, “Oh, we can’t challenge him at all”. What we have to do is challenge people and say, “Look, when a conservative says the right thing about economics and a liberal or somebody else says something right about civil liberties and getting the government out of our personal lives, or anybody who’d say we should have a foreign policy that makes sense … And we have coalitions in Congress now. Because there are less democrats because we have a current Democratic president, the coalitions is smaller, but the numbers of the Republicans are growing in this coalition who’re saying, “We don’t need this”. So, this is, once again, bringing people together and seeing liberty as a whole. Its one pieces, and I think that’s what we have to work on.
A lot of times they want to accuse us of wanting to go back to the dark ages, but the dark ages are authoritarianism. Freedom is a relatively new idea. The history of man, when you consider the history of the universe and how many billions of years the planets and all existed, man has only been around for a short period of time. And knowledgeable man has just been around for thousands of years, when they were reflecting and writing books. So it’s a very short period of time. But the history of man making great progress and understanding how important liberty is, is very, very short. In terms of all history, it’s just a couple of seconds or couple of minutes. So, we’re really just on the cusp of understanding what this is all about and what it can bring about. But there’s only one principle that has to be followed – because our views and our desires and our preferences are all different – and that is, you can’t force other people to do your bidding if they’re not hurting you. But a lot of people will accept that, it’s easier to get them to accept that: just don’t hurt me or don’t steal my property. But then they say it’s okay for the government to do it. The government’s not allowed to initiate force against anybody, either, they can only be a participant in trying to repel force or settle disputes, but they can’t come along and say, “We’re going to use force to make other people do our bidding, even if the individual shouldn’t do it”. So it’s individuals and government that should never be able to initiate force or violence against another to bring about social or economic changes. That one rule would solve practically all our problems, I’ll tell you.
But we should be very optimistic, I know there are some who say we should have done better in the campaign. Quite frankly, I think we did pretty good. Those who said we should have done significantly better, I don’t know whether they quite understand what we, as a group, are taking on. It isn’t like we’re taking on one small faction of the Republican Party and say, “Yea, we want to nudge you into being a little bit more conservative”, or something like that. We’re taking on the establishment that controls both parties. So, it’s the banking system, it’s the welfare state, it’s the military-industrial complex, it’s a lot of corporatism and subsidies that go out to so many. So I’ll say that the task is rather large so the success, I think, is very significant. But the other way you might look at it, if you’re looking for a positive sign: I don’t know how many candidates were there 4 years ago, let’s say there were 12 and let’s say there’re about 10 or 12 more this time, so there are about 20 now. There weren’t many that came in second, there were a few that dropped by the wayside that didn’t make an impact and they were done and gone and they have debt in the bank and they don’t even pay their bills. But the real excitement is from the number of people that are joining us, and that’s where we should be positive. We have so many more people now in office at all levels of government, and there are going to be a lot more added this fall. Now, that isn’t the total measurement, but it is a significant measurement. There are some people that love liberty and fight for it and write about it and say, “You know, this voting stuff doesn’t add up to too much”. But, political activism, if it had been ignored by the founders, we would still be in a pretty big mess, because they were philosophic and they were idealistic, but they took political action, too. So that’s why, I think political action is quite alright. But I want to encourage you and thank you for all that you have done. Continue to do your work and do your job. And you might ask, “What is my job?” You have to decide what your job is. The only thing I can urge you to do is try and understand the principles, understand the principles of liberty. But you’re here, you’re participating, you’re involved and we have people representing us at different levels of government. But everybody has something to do, it can be purely educational. When people come in to my office and ask, “How do I become a congressman?” I say, “Don’t even try, its okay if it happens to come along, most of it is luck”, and this sort of thing. There are a lot of uncertainties about running for office, and there is some luck in it. But, a lot of times, if they were very interested, I encourage them to by saying that I would just love to see more of them in the media, more writers, more in the newspapers, and the TV. But, even that’s getting easier, because, right now, if you look at the number of people who look at CNN for their news, most people are now getting more news off the internet on their computers than they are from CNN. So we’re already there in many ways. And everybody has different talents, some people don’t even want to do public speaking, some people enjoy it, some people want to run for office. Some people actually have a knack to make money even under these circumstances in this economy. Well, let them go make the money and let them help out the other groups. And we have a lot of supporters that way and that’s the prime goal, that they do well and understand it and they make money and they donate to these organizations. So that is pretty important.
Once you discover what’s going on and you basically understand this philosophy, actually it’s a pretty uncomfortable position to put you in, because I hope you’re miserable for the rest of your life unless you’re trying to do something about it. And I do believe that the people who are informed, if they’re moral persons and they say, “We know this is a bad situation”, and if you’re directed by wanting to know the truth and spread the truth, and it’s a moral principle, you do have a greater obligation. And you know what, you’re in a group that’s only going to be probably the group that’s about 10% of the population, because you know the issues and you understand and study and you read. But most people, even those who vote, don’t think about it until the day before the elections sometimes. All this polling on who’s going to win in November, I think that’s all talk because I think a bunch of people aren’t even going to pay much attention. And, who knows, there might be something else to do that day or it might rain and they might not even show up, for that matter. But your role is very important, and that’s why I work very hard and encourage everyone on the team for Campaign for Liberty to be involved. I’m glad you’re here and want to assume some responsibility. And, of course, if you don’t have any fun doing it, it can be a real dull job. So have some fun doing it, and one thing that is fun, is being with like-minded people, isn’t that pretty neat? And, to tell you the truth, I like to be with people that are like-minded that might have a completely different attitude about what their social values are and what they want to do with their money and how they want to do it, because I can just sort of smile and say, “Well, I wouldn’t do that, that’s a pretty stupid thing to do”. But I think it’s still neat that we can bring these people together and say, “It’s freedom, it’s liberty, that’s what we’re fighting for”.
Thank you very much for all your efforts, thank you.

There are so many of these organizations it is hard to keep track.

The incredible conceit that Ayn Rand will figure in the history of philosophy as one of the greats–better than Kant (“corrupt”), Hegel (“nonsensical”) or Wittgenstein (“garbage”)–is not restricted to her contemporary followers: Rand, in the same 1957 interview with Mike Wallace linked above, described herself, he boldly totalitarian discourse of justified elimination, produced a scant dozen years after the end of the second world war. It is a tradition upheld by contemporary Randians: Brooks has called for unrestricted, murderous warfare in Iraq (see above); Leonard Peikoff, who originally founded the Ayn Rand Institute, calls for the “immediate end” of “terrorist states” such as Iran, not ruling out nuclear weapons, and this “regardless of the countless innocents caught in the line of fire.” statements.

Indeed the crisis in the foundations of mathematics, the work of Tarski on truth, the rejection of the law of excluded middle by Brouwer and his followers, Gödel’s proofs–the list could be multiplied–had no effect on her,. For a philosopher who prized logic, she remained utterly ignorant of it until her death, and some of her most ardent followers are determined to remain so themselves: Peikoff disparages all non-Aristotelian logic as “inherently dishonest [...] an explicit rebellion against reason and reality (and, therefore, against man and values).” “A is A” turned into a statement about the essential ‘nature’ of humankind that carries with it the full logical weight of the putative axiom.

The polarizing effect is indeed remarkable, and, I think, unnecessary. I regard myself as a Rand moderate on her specific economic and ethical doctrines, not lukewarm about each separate doctrine, but firmly accepting some and firmly rejecting others. Having said that, I cannot see her as a significant philosopher, because she did not support her views with arguments that can stand up to academic scrutiny.
By coincidence, I posted a few thoughts on the polarization, a couple of days after you made your post but shortly before reading your post, having found it via Brian Leiter’s blog. My thoughts are here:

Thanks for this essay; it’s both engaging and well-balanced. Problematically, most sustained treatments of Rand tend to come either from the converted, or (only slightly better) the recently lapsed. Given the reliably shallow philosophical bona fides of this cohort, it’s not surprising that there’s very little meat there. At the same time, most commentators of the out-of-group perspective tend to be (I would say justifiably) hostile to the point of engaging mainly through ridicule. This is warranted, but not particularly helpful to people who both lack a background in philosophy and whose first brush with political argument comes from Rand’s work. As you rightly note, it’s precisely this combination–something like base-rate ignorance combined with ready availability, which explains much of the appeal.
Thanks for providing the valuable work of baloney detection!
“One wonders at the type of celebration of ‘life’ that centers around satisfied joy at the perishing of so-called ‘parasites.”
The above assertion is one of the earlier and more blatantly dishonest statements (though certainly not the first blatant ad hom) made in this blog post – a post overflowing with such lies, smears, and overt dishonesty. The blogger quotes Alan Greenspan, who states:
“”Atlas Shrugged’ is a celebration of life and happiness. Justice is unrelenting. Creative individuals and undeviating purpose and rationality achieve joy and fulfillment. Parasites who persistently avoid either purpose or reason perish as they should.”
In other words, he describes creative individuals who achieve joy and fulfillment by means of undeviating purpose and rationality. But the blog poster here chooses to lie and claim Greenspan is saying the individual’s joy and fulfillment comes *from* the perishing of the parasites. In fact he claims that Rand’s characters’ joy “centers” on those others – the joy is derived from the suffering of those others. That Miss Rand’s book is a celebration of this form of ‘joy’.
This is a deliberate fabrication on the part of the blogger. It is a lie.
The blogger has claimed the opposite of what Greenspan stated and what Miss Rand promotes. What he describes is what Rand identifies as “secondhandedness” – something she does not “celebrate” but in fact *condemns*!
This is not an innocent error on the part of this blogger. It is a deliberate misrepresentation of Miss Rand and her philosophy. It is the creation of a straw man, which he attacks – because he cannot attack her actual philosophy. Because he cannot attack it, but does not want it to stand, he must resort to fallacies instead. He must create falsehoods – fictions – which he then pretends are Miss Rand.
Why do all this – why engage in such massive dishonesty? To try to hide the truth from others. He does not want others to identify the facts – the actual ideas Miss Rand presents. So he pretends to present them and hopes others will accept his falsehoods.
He hopes others will be second-handers. He hopes they will not go to the source but will instead accept his conclusions on faith.
For the honest intellectual, don’t be taken in by the duplicity of Miss Rand’s enemies. Don’t rely on smears they try to pass off as ‘fact’. Don’t be a second-hander. Don’t rely on the conclusions of others. Don’t act on faith. Be independent. Be rational. Read what she *actually* wrote. Come to your own conclusions based on actual facts, not false assertions. Bypass those who would try to derail you from identifying Rand’s actual philosophy.
Put simply, don’t let the dishonest men, like this blogger, dupe you. Practice reason and independent judgment. That way, whether you end up agreeing or disagreeing with Miss Rand, you will have done so on the basis of fact, reason, and your own independent judgment – not lies and faith.
I think you’ve attracted your first real live member of the Rand cult, whose dialectical skill is at the level of Rand’s!
How about actually dealing with what he posted instead of just calling him a cultist?
B Leigh Smith –
I appreciate your concern about my reading of Greenspan’s written remarks. I assure you I was not deliberately trying to misdirect readers by distorting the meaning of the quote. When Greenspan said that “parasites … perish as they should,” I found the “as they should” pregnant with meaning. The ‘should’ implied a normative dimension that placed the assertion within the context of the statement about ‘unrelenting’ justice, which immediately follows the sentence about the “celebration of life.”
Given that Rand’s view is that ‘life’ has a sole and unique value, it stood to reason that the only way to properly celebrate life is to dispense a justice such that producers thrive and parasites die. This does not imply that Greenspan, or Randians generally, derive *pleasure* from the elimination of the so-called ‘unproductive’, but–however–it seems pretty clear that, for Rand, to celebrate *life*–what life intrinsically is, necessarily so– requires that those who avoid “purpose” and “reason,” that is, those who deny the essential telos of life, perish. (A situation where ‘parasites’ multiply is not one where life is being celebrated, in other words.)
I cannot help but wonder how charitable you would be faced with a quote from, say, Lenin about bourgeois parasites. It is rather unnerving, in fact, how similar all this is to the discourse of the Soviet Union, which enforced “social parasitism” laws:
The only difference seems to be that in one case, the State is enforcing a “productive” and “anti-parasite” eliminativist discourse, whereas for Randians, the so-called “market” performs the same function. The difference seems to be that you think this latter mechanism is moral, because the individual is putatively responsible for their own fate, entirely. This denies the existence of moral luck (). But, plainly, there is such a thing as moral luck. Therefore, this view is false.
“The ‘should’ implied a normative dimension that placed the assertion within the context of the statement about ‘unrelenting’ justice,”
Indeed. And the “unrelenting justice” applied to BOTH parties – those “creative individuals and undeviating purpose and rationality” justly earn their “joy and fulfillment”. And those “parasites who persistently avoid either purpose or reason” do not earn such “joy and fulfillment” but instead justly “perish”. What Miss Rand “celebrates” is virtue and its reward – the values pursued – ie “life and happiness”. Both those things are not granted automatically but must be achieved. That is the justice referenced. And if one has read Atlas Shrugged, one is quite aware of this fact. One is quite aware of her views of rationality, independence, and second-handers. To claim that Miss Rand preaches a “celebration of ‘life’ that centers around satisfied joy at the perishing of so-called ‘parasites”" is to completely and purposefully present the opposite of her entire philosophy, as expressed through her entire book.
In other words, you deliberately drop the context of her entire novel in order to make that assertion, based on a brief summary presented by someone else.
That is not an honest error. That is deliberate misrepresentation. It is deliberate dishonesty.
“it seems pretty clear that, for Rand, to celebrate *life*–what life intrinsically is, necessarily so– requires that those who avoid “purpose” and “reason,” that is, those who deny the essential telos of life, perish.”
This is false. For an individual to celebrate his life and his happiness does not require others to perish. If they indeed initiate force against him, as she makes clear, they are properly stopped. But other than that protection of his freedom, his life and happiness do not require anything of parasites, etc.. That was one of the fundamental premises of the novel. That the producer does not require anything from the parasite. That was the purpose of the strike – to show that very thing.
Again, to make this claim is to completely drop the context of her entire story and philosophy as she explicitly lays it out in her novel. And, again, such a *massively* dropped context is *not* the result of an innocent error.
” It is rather unnerving, in fact, how similar all this is to the discourse of the Soviet Union, which enforced “social parasitism” laws:”
And now you drop the entire point she made about the difference between voluntary human interaction and the initiation of force. You PRETEND that what she wants is the same thing as the Soviet Union wanted – that self-defense and murder are the SAME thing – because both are about “unnervingly” about ‘killing’. You purposefully evade her *entire* argument about the difference between the two and condemn her by trying to place her in the same category.
This is why I say you are completely dishonest. You do not argue against Miss Rand. You do not present HER arguments and attempt to use reason against them. You manufacture falsehoods and present them as if they were hers. That is lying.
And that is why I suggest anyone honestly interested in the facts about Miss Rand’s philosophy look to her actual work. That way they can independently judge her work rationally rather than accepting such lies as if they were the truth.
–
As to your assertions about “luck”, it is not “luck” which causes individuals to pursue “undeviating purpose” and “rationality”. Nor is it “luck” which causes individuals to “avoid purpose or reason”. These are all choices an individual makes every moment of every day in regard to reality around him.
In other words, you once again present an argument which is NOT Miss Rand’s argument. Attack *it*. And then declare *her* wrong because your manufactured argument is wrong.
Attacking deliberately manufactured straw men here is the problem. Presenting falsehoods in place of Miss Rand’s actual ideas is the problem.
And the solution, as I’ve previously indicated, is for the honestly interested individual to view her work first hand, rather than relying upon second hand assertions – assertions which are blatantly false.
Atlas Shrugged’ is a celebration of life and happiness. Justice is unrelenting. Creative individuals and undeviating purpose and rationality achieve joy and fulfillment. Parasites who persistently avoid either purpose or reason perish as they should.”
Brian–
I am reminded of a comment on your blog when the SEP entry was first brought up: “try to avoid introducing her name into an otherwise serious discussion anywhere on the internet, or this sort of drivel will start to surface like globs of oil on a Louisiana beach, and end up polluting everything.”
B Leigh Smith–
You’re putting words in my mouth here, after I explicitly said I did not think that the Randian ethic required deriving pleasure from perishing. I do say–and you agree–that Randians are perfectly fine with the suffering of ‘unproductive’ elements, that this very thing is in fact fine and quite just; I find it morally abhorrent, but I suppose we can agree to disagree.
You seem also unable to understand the concept of ‘moral luck’ by your assimilation of it with the ordinary sense of ‘luck.’ While there is a distinction between acting towards x, and letting x happen, it is precisely because I do not think it makes a moral difference in this case that I contest the picture you present: in part because of ‘moral luck’, and in part because I do not view the ‘market’ as a neutral evaluative entity, but an active collusion of coercive interests.
In any event, I do encourage readers to look after the primary sources and draw their own conclusions. Thank you for contributing.
Oh and this statement:
““One wonders at the type of celebration of ‘life’ that centers around satisfied joy at the perishing of so-called ‘parasites.””
most certainly does more than “imply”, it actually STATES “that Greenspan, or Randians generally, derive *pleasure* from the elimination of the so-called ‘unproductive’”
Now, if you want to RESCIND that original claim, then please do so. Otherwise your straw man, and the identification of it as such, stands.
What would truly be remarkable, is if there were some web forum set up where professionally-trained philosophers, both pro-Rand and anti-Rand, could have it out. I’d estimate that the number of philosophers *at least reasonably* well-versed in Rand, or take her seriously enough to engage her ideas indepth, is more or less split between the pro-side and the anti-side. I make that observation merely to point out that such a web-debate wouldn’t be lopsided numbers-wise, the way the numbers are lopsided if you were to compare the number of those academic philosophers who take her seriously to that of the academic community as a whole. As we all should know, however, truth doesn’t reside in numbers of people affirming something as true.
What the above blog post glaringly neglects to mention is the *academic literature on Rand*, which includes such works as Tara Smith’s “Ayn Rand’s Normative Ethics” published by CUP, and Chris Matthew Sciabarra’s “Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical.” (This latter work, very extensively researched, proposes a thesis that directly contradicts one of your characterizations: that Rand ignores *context* of all things. Context is fundamental, central, and crucial to Rand’s methodology.) The amount of academic literature on Rand is small indeed, but it’s there. I think that familiarity with works such as these should be a prerequisite for entering the sort of web-debate I wishfully propose above. There is, in addition, the Ayn Rand Society – aynrandsociety.org – a professional association within the APA. Steering committee members have included Douglas Rasmussen, who (along with Douglas Den Uyl) wrote a response to Nozick, “Nozick on the Randian Argument,” in the same journal some years later, which reformulates the Randian argument along neo-Aristotelian lines. It does no one any good to pretend that such rebuttals don’t exist.
There are many characterizations and claims in the blog post which mischaracterize Rand’s views on key points (the one about context already mentioned), or subtly misfire, or simply miss their mark. This is *not* to say that Rand isn’t open to well-supported criticism – like the way Rand herself mischaracterizes, subtly misfires, or simply misses her mark when discussing other philosophers – such as Kant most especially. While Rand does make the presumption to her readers of being a competent historian of philosophy, she makes next to no pretense to being a *scholarly* interpreter of such figures. That wasn’t her thing. And that is part of what diminishes any value there might be in her commentary on the history of philosophy. By the same token, if one is to make the representation of approaching Rand in a scholarly fashion, it simply won’t do not to engage the most prominent extant scholarly literature. Ask yourself whether Sciabarra or Prof. Smith would take your criticisms seriously on their scholarly merits alone, let alone the quality of the criticisms. (They would not, on either count.)
It is easy to cherry-pick some of Rand’s statements that cast her in a more negative light, but if we’re going to keep the *full context,* it is only fair that the statements that cast her in a positive light also be just as prominently featured – else people are left with little idea as to why Rand really does carry the appeal that she does. If it were all about her making all kinds of philosophical claims simply on the basis of “A is A,” one would be left with the impression that she and her followers (and the aforementioned academic scholars!) aren’t all that well-versed in critical thinking. A fictional character stating that man’s rights are based on “A is A” is indeed a rhetorical approach – but one of condensing a vast set of observations, of summarizing a vast *context,* and such statements cannot be taken in isolation from their extensive *context*. All kinds of considerations come to bear on such a statement – some sort of “essentialist” view about humans having an identifiable and definable nature, that to be is to be something of a specific nature (she holds the law of identity to be a principle primarily of *metaphysics*, about the character of being qua being, and her neo/quasi-Aristotelian approach to metaphysics does not dualistically divorce metaphysics from empirical content – i.e., the law of identity has a natural and empirical aspect). Furthermore, it’s completely unfounded – and in fact contradictory to Rand’s own statements – for Nozick (and you, repeating Nozick) to ascribe to Rand the notion that “A is A” means that A cannot change. Hell, if you look at the way she quotes from Aristotle very near the end of “Atlas,” she qualifies her own view of identity the way he does: “at the same time and in the same respect.” Now, Nozick didn’t have such a thing as the Ayn Rand Lexicon at his avail back in 1971, so Rand-scholarship that seemed appropriate then would be viewed as most sloppy today given the scholarship resources that now exist (not the least of which is the Rasmussen-Den Uyl rebuttal).
By the way, if you’re going to bring up Nozick, either regarding his critique of “the Randian argument” or how well his “AS&U” treatise was received by the left-leaning academic mainstream, you might as well also mention his later article on why intellectuals oppose capitalism. That may better put into context the statement in the Stanford Encyclopedia entry about the relative lack of attention her views have received in the academy given her political views. If her arguments were so pitifully bad as to be unworthy of academic attention, that’s one thing. That her arguments aren’t presented in academic format might better help to explain things here, though that doesn’t directly speak to the inherent merits of her arguments. The only issue of concern is whether her arguments are good or not. Now, people like Rasmussen and Den Uyl, who have devoted oodles of attention to Rand’s ideas, would probably say that Rand is pretty much right in the basics even if they aren’t spelled out at the level of detail that academics crave. (She wasn’t writing for that audience; she was writing at a level that the “ordinary folk” could understand, and she had this habit of condensing philosophical ideas down to their “essence” in the briefest way she could state them, as a matter of economy and attention-grabbingness. It took conversations like those she had with John Hospers to tease out all the intricate details – and I don’t think he left disappointed.) What you have in works like Rasmussen and Den Uyl’s, and Smith’s, and Sciabarra’s, are extensive and detailed workings-out of the core principles. You want a basically Randian argument for rights in fully-fleshed-out academic detail? There’s Rasmussen and Den Uyl’s “Norms of Liberty.” You want the Randian normative ethics fleshed out in academic detail? There’s Smith’s “Ayn Rand’s Normative Ethics.” You want her philosophical methodology spelled out in detail? There’s Sciabarra’s academic work, “Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical” and Leonard Peikoff’s non-academic (but fully expert on Rand) lecture series “Understanding Objectivism,” released in book form earlier this year.
Now, none of this justifies the conceit you point out among some of her devotees that Rand massively supersedes all other philosophers in history save for Aristotle. As you point out, Anscombe and others were working in 1957. It is also warranted to point out that Rand, in addition to Anscombe and Foot and Veatch and others, contributed to the neo-Aristotelian revival in ethics around that time. When Rand composed her paper, “The Objectivist Ethics,” you have to consider the context of the times in which she was writing it, before virtue ethics had had its revival. In *that* context, Rand was well ahead of many of her contemporaries on some of the most important questions in ethical theory. This is *not* to say that she stands out as something really, really special over and above all the other philosophers in history (save again for Aristotle). It *is* to say that she was, in her own fashion, a serious truth-seeker doing her best in the context of her time to make systematic sense of the world almost all on her own (that is, after she parted ways with Isabel Paterson in the late ’40s), which puts her squarely in the category of “serious philosopher” – in addition to many, many other serious philosophers who also deserve to be taken seriously and studied (take note of this latter part, hardcore Rand-worshippers).
This is getting long, and I don’t mean to filibuster. But I think you get the idea. I didn’t even expound further on how Rand’s “A is A” comes to bear on her argument for rights in the full philosophical context (I merely addressed her interpretation/variation on Aristotle’s formulation as far as metaphysics goes), though you could get the fleshed-out idea in places like the aforementioned “Norms of Liberty.” And I hope it gives a good idea as to why I’d love to see a bona fide webbed Rand-debate forum where “the Rand experts” could put it all on display for people to see. That would, I think, go a long way toward bridging the unfortunate gap between Rand’s widespread cultural appeal in America and her near-neglect within the academy. We cannot, as a political community (which is much broader than the academic community), have a meaningful and informed debate on the political issues of our time at the highest level unless the competing views get a full airing-out from the most qualified/expert proponents of those ideas. An academic circle-jerk won’t accomplish any such thing besides an implicit or explicit contempt for “the masses.” The flipside of the academic circle-jerk is the “average American” ignoring what the academics say (due to their “being up in those ivory towers of theory sheltered from the real world”), leading to a national political debate that is that much more impoverished, like what we’re getting on TV. What we desperately, urgently need a mutual coming-to-terms. Also, with such a forum of experts having it out, the professors who get inundated with those new students every year pushing the Randian line can direct their attention to the webbed Rand-debate forum. A win-win all around!
(And why the hell hasn’t this happened already? Does the cultural acrimony over Rand need to come to a bulging, pulsating head before it does?)
B Leigh Smith: it’s somewhat ambiguous whether the “at” in the sentence that’s making you froth at the mouth should really be read as a “towards” or as an “at the same time as.” In the former case, the “at” is directional, expressing the object of Randian joy: the suffering of the unproductive. In the latter case, on the other hand, the “at” is more or less indicating a position in time (in this case, contemporaneity with something else) with no implication of one being caused by the other.
But even if your interpretation of McGinnis’ “at” is correct, it’s unclear what you’ve actually gained. Maybe you’ve showed that he’s got a bit of a bias, but any third grader could tell you that just by reading the picture captions. His substantive criticisms of Rand’s philosophy are utterly devastating, and your huge, flailing fuss about his remarks on Randian joy is ultimately a bunch of whiney nitpicking. You said in your first post that McGinnis “cannot attack her actual philosophy,” but that’s precisely what he did do in the rest of the post. It seems to me, rather, that you cannot defend her philosophy, and so you go on rabid tirades about some minor remark that may or may not be fallacious. Why don’t you do some philosophical heavy lifting and defend Rand from McGinnis’s withering criticisms. Let’s start with the logic.
“if your interpretation of McGinnis’ “at” is correct, it’s unclear what you’ve actually gained.”
What is gained is the identification of his claims as false – deliberately so. And it is gained in regard to the supposed summary of the work he is attacking. By demonstrating that the author cannot even honestly summarize the words he quotes in his own article, it calls into question all his subsequent claims about that work.
I am sorry that such a demonstration does not lead you to even question his subsequent “criticisms”. As indicated, they are simply attacks upon straw men, not Miss Rand’s actual ideas. As such, they are not “substantive” let alone “devastating”.
“you said in your first post that McGinnis “cannot attack her actual philosophy,” but that’s precisely what he did do in the rest of the post.”
Attacking straw men is what he did. If you believe otherwise, please provide an example of what you claim is his honest and accurate presentation of one of her ideas, along with a rational refutation of it. Simply accepting his words, in contradiction to the major misrepresentation he provides early on in his work (combined with all his ad homs, mud slinging, and other blatant fallacies), is an act of faith, not reason. It is the acceptance of something in contradiction to, rather than in accord with, the facts.
You claim you want to start with logic. But you begin with its opposite.
It is for this very reason that I admonished those honestly interested in Miss Rand’s ideas to look to her actual work. I am sorry you did not choose to heed that rational recommendation.
But dude, isn’t Atlas Shrugged an extended fantasy in which Randian geniuses get to inflict this supposedly deserved suffering on the so-called parasites? I can’t see any other way to read it, given the ending. And if so, isn’t it natural to think that Greenspan et al must really enjoy this fantasy?
Obviously, dude = B Leigh Smith. I should learn to refresh before posting comments.
The issue is a distraction, but frankly, I don’t know how else to read this quote. One last time:
‘Atlas Shrugged’ is a celebration of life and happiness. Justice is unrelenting. Creative individuals and undeviating purpose and rationality achieve joy and fulfillment. Parasites who persistently avoid either purpose or reason perish as they should.
The novel contains a summary and exposition of her philosophy. So this is a paraphrase which conveys my reading of Greenspan’s remarks:
Ayn Rand’s philosophy is a celebration of life and happiness in which an unrelenting justice is served, one that rewards the productive and disposes of the parasites.
It is precisely because this justice is served that the philosophy is celebratory of what life properly is. The philosophy is celebratory, though particular individuals do not ‘celebrate’ or throw parties when the homeless die: what is celebrated in her thought is the inherent, rational justice of unproductive elements ‘perishing’. But I find the entire discourse morally odious. The egregious and monstruous simplification of the complexity of life–its hazard, illnesses, precarities, vulnerabilities, histories, the entire baggage of context–reduced to a binary, the choice between ‘using one’s reason’ and not—it is, quite properly, evil. There is no justice when so-called parasites ‘perish’. There is only the immorality of fellow man standing by and doing nothing.
Elie Wiesel wrote that “the opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference. The opposite of beauty is not ugliness, it’s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it’s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, but indifference between life and death.” The essence of duty is found in what we owe to each other. The anti-life philosophy is the denial of this duty and the justification of an indifference to death and suffering. And this is why I should bother even writing any of this.
Smith-
I think it points to the strength of McGinnis’ argument that you are forced to address one minute section of his lengthy discussion of Ayn Rand’s questionable philosophy. You claim to be upset that McGinnis (supposedly) “STATES” that Randians directly obtain pleasure from the suffering of the parasitic masses Rand portrays in her works. However, it is not so hard to see that you are actually a tad bit hurt over the reasonable and thought-provoking analysis that damages, no doubt, a hero of yours. If you desire to assert that the author has attacked a straw man (rather than Rand’s actual ideas), bringing up more than one insignificant example might help your cause. Of course when critiquing someone, it is not possible to present the totality of their views completely objectively-I would be more careful before pointing out a fallacy that is not to be found in this paper.
On another note, a statement of yours implicates Rand to be downright stupid if we are to take your word for it.
“That the producer does not require anything from the parasite. That was the purpose of the strike – to show that very thing”
If, you in fact, believe that what you wrote here is true, than you take Rand to be an imbecile completely out of touch with reality, logic, and reason. How would anything the producers produce have value without the “parasitic” masses that utilize products? Being a non-parasite requires lower individuals to exist. Everything about the distinction between parasites and producers necessitates the dual existence of those who make, and those who use what is made. “The producer does not require anything from the parasite”-except for his body to overwork, his mind to manipulate, and his earnings to take.
It is my belief that McGinnis wrote a very respectable and convincing article regarding an important and popular American figure. I just wish you had voiced an equally defensible response.
“How would anything the producers produce have value without the “parasitic” masses that utilize products?”
Apparently you believe that the individuals in Galt’s Gulch, who were neither parasites nor the “masses”, traded no values with one another.
Thank you for making clear you haven’t read, let alone understood, the work and ideas you sneeringly (ie fallaciously) attack. Thank you for your display of a stream of ad homs and psychologizing in place of rational argumentation. And thank you for making clear your belief that a deliberate lie presented as the *summary* of the work the blogger attacks is merely ‘minutia’. All these things demonstrate you have no actual knowledge of Miss Rand’s ideas – but that you won’t let a little thing like a lack of facts prevent you from lashing out at that which you are ignorant.
Re: the perishing of parasites. Has it occurred to Rand’s rather shrill critics that the parasites she has in mind are *not* the poor, the sick, the vulnerable, etc., but the Orren Boyles, the Balph Eubanks, the Mr. Thompsons, the James Taggarts, the Wesley Mouches, the Floyd Ferrises, the Philip and Lillian Reardens, the Robert Stadlers, et al? Sure, you might regard them as one-dimensional caricature figures (though there is a clear conflict in Stadler, who was once honorable but evades/chooses evil), but aren’t these the ones deserving of their fate? The “ordinary” people who perish in the Taggart Tunnel did *not* deserve to perish, but Rand describes the ideas they all hold to *illustrate the power of ideas* for good or for evil. Rand reportedly cried when writing out the fate of Gail Wynand. Did she enjoy watching his evasions lead to his demise? Of course not. What’s more, when you think of the above-named villains in *Atlas* when the term “parasite” is brought to mind, doesn’t that make *a lot more sense* than Rand targeting the poor, the vulnerable, etc.? Doesn’t it make it more of an interesting challenge to tear down Rand, then, as opposed to the swift and easy knock-down of a strawman? Isn’t going after the opponent’s strongest argument the essence of philosophical method and of intellectual charity? (It’s like I’m repeating myself now, but Rand has similar flaws when approaching Kant and other “villains” in the history of philosophy. Two-way street. Or, better yet, how about we walk down the street – peripatetically, if you must – in the same direction with the same goal in mind.)
That said, why shouldn’t reality be its own avenger – that the Mouches and Ferrises and Thompsons perish due to their own anti-life choices/evasions? Is that not justice? And it’s not like the strikers didn’t offer them an olive branch of sorts – assuming they could sit through the entirety of Galt’s interminable speech
– to allow them the opportunity to change their ways before the final collapse. If you want to blame someone for the collapse, do you look at the strikers who are withdrawing their sanction and services on terms other than what they consent to (fundamentally, that the mind be left free to function as it is [axiomatically?] supposed to), or is the blame rightly placed on those in the established power structure who endlessly evade the requirements of proper human existence? When you bash Rand, you’re by extension bashing the strikers and assigning to them the responsibility of the civilization perishing. Is that justice?
(The further twist to all this is to ask whether Galt and the strikers could have accomplished their aims without going on a secret strike and not letting society know about it until nearly the end. That goes to the realism of the plot. The original premise of the plot, though, was what if the “men of the mind and of ability” (and note that Galt’s Gulch is filled with some “non-elites,” the fishwife for instance wink wink) were to go on strike, the way the laborers were carrying out strikes in the Red Decade and after on the apparent assumption that their physical labor is the prime mover of wealth-creation. The realism of the plot is a distinct issue, though; the theme of the novel is “the role of the mind in man’s existence,” and if people fail to get *that*, then they miss the whole point of the novel. Their loss.)
Damn, it feels downright easy decisively defending Rand at this point. Don’t the critics have anything better? I mean, how *hard* is it to figure out that the parasites Rand has primarily in mind are the Mouches et al?
Here’s a better example to harp on, if you had paid attention to the novel as Rand had expected her readers to do: As Dagny and the other heroes go to rescue Galt toward the end, she aims a gun at the heart of a rank-and-file guard blocking her way, and shoots him dead. The rationale was that this was the logically appropriate response to someone who had evaded the responsibility of thinking even when they had a gun pointed at them (aha! how does a gun make someone think, Galt asks earlier? you were paying attention there, too, right?) and had the chance to move out of the way? Question being: was shooting this guard dead *necessary* to carry out the rescue? Did Rand think this scenario through adequately? Was time too much of a factor to concern oneself with alternative measures? (Gee, it may very well have been.) Anyway, it’s easy to subject Rand to effective criticism or challenge, as long as one knows what the hell one is doing. In my experience, few seem to manage it. To do it most effectively would probably require extensive familiarity with things like Peikoff’s “Understanding Objectivism,” though at that point you do get into the problem of invoking Rand in order to deny her. I think if you’re dedicated enough to do that, you should be commended. In any event, how does one carry out a resounding, convincing criticism of whatever Rand got wrong, without thoroughly studying up on the subject? Are her critics expected to be taken seriously if they don’t even *bother* with the now-published “Understanding Objectivism” much less Peikoff’s earlier primer “OPAR”? Do we simply ignore what her best student, top-notch interpreter and chosen heir has to say? For that matter, do we one-sidedly latch onto the “hazards” part of Nathaniel Branden’s “Benefits and Hazards” essay? That doesn’t strike me as good scholarship at all. I dunno, seems like I’m shooting fish in a barrel at this point. Please prove me wrong.
.”
So is this why Wynand is supposed to be the hero of “The Fountainhead,” seeing as Roark turned down an integrity-compromising commission, followed by his having to close up shop? It’s all about the dollars in her value hierarchy, just because the hero traces the sign of the dollar in the air? Are you sure this is careful, nuanced analysis?
I could go on and on like this, you know.
Thanks for a solid peek into the world / cult of Rand, a subject which I had so far not got around to investigating for myself in such depth, and for which omission I no longer feel any significant deficiency in my self-education budget.
Frankly, Randian gunk has too often popped up along side too many other dubious assertions for me to have ever bothered digging in with gusto, and the cursory forays I’ve made otherwise have only exposed simple show stoppers (for me), such as her effective hate-on for basics like empathy and cooperation, which I see as the only sound organizational core instincts we silly monkeys might hope to survive by.
Now if only you could recommend the economic equivalent to your fine essay here, regarding Friedman, I’d be all set. I guess I’ll just have to do some of my own homework after all
Cheers, and thanks again, great read, and really appreciated the humor too (don’t listen to those who would have you be boring, you’re doing it right).

Or, perhaps:

This essay contains perhaps one of the longest straw man bashings on the internet. For Ayn Rand, the axioms of Objectivism are not starting points for the deduction of a philosophy; they are, rather, what make the *induction* of general, philosophical principles possible.
This assumption that philosophy must be essentially deductive is one of the major problems that mainstream academics have in understanding Objectivism. In particular, it is what afflicts Nozick’s attempted analysis of Rand’s meta-ethical argument; he is trying to understand an essentially inductive argument as a deductive one. So it is no surprise that he thinks the conclusions are unsupported.
I recommend this post for more detail on my point, along with the book referenced there:
No rebuttals to my comments? Nothing? I thought the blog posting was supposed to be, in the word of one clueless commenter (), “a solid peek into the world / cult of Rand”? No retractions of obvious misrepresentations? No reworkings to take into account strong criticism? This is a *philosophy* blog, is it not? We’re supposed to be learning why philosophers needn’t take Rand seriously, are we not? How can we learn when there’s no response to feedback? Are we just supposed to pretend that the existing body of Rand scholarship doesn’t exist? Only the “cultists” merit (derisory) responses? Well . . . what?
I’m just amazed that, 50 years after “The Objectivist Ethics,” and nearly 70 years after *The Fountainhead*, the Rand-bashers *stil* cannot (refuse to?) demonstrate a sound understanding of what they’re bashing. When it’s explained to them that they are sloppily, incompetently, misunderstanding – in obvious ways, no less – I’ve seen many of them retreat to some formulaic sneer about how “only the cult truly understands.” Give me an effing break! “Only the cult truly understands” that the parasites are the Mouches/Thompsons/Keatings/Tooheys, or that Roark does in fact respect and practice “basics like empathy and cooperation”?
I have the impression that the state of Rand interpretation was hardly even close to this bad during the time she was writing her newsletters and giving addresses, and was a well-known contemporary commentator. A few mediocre book-length critiques appeared in the decade following the Branden Break. Not understanding the power and basis of Rand’s appeal, the critics don’t bother with her for a couple decades, and neither is there much in the way of favorable commentary. But then comes a new generational wave that comes of age around the time of Sciabarra’s “Russian Radical” – the generation including Jimmy Wales – and the state of Rand scholarship has been picking up steam since. The interest in Rand didn’t die out as the critics had hoped. Listening to those very critics, you’d never be able to tell that there was a post-Sciabarra universe of Rand scholarship.
Had Miss Rand been around today to observe this, I think she would say something to the effect of, “This is not an honest mistake.” So far the critics don’t seem much interested in proving such a hypothesis mistaken. Some years back, the standard formulaic sneer was that Rand wasn’t a serious enough philosopher to be taken seriously in the academy. You’d think that with the appearance of the Smith book in 2006, and with the existence and activities of the Ayn Rand Society, these folks would be responsive to new information.
Just wait until the newest generational wave reads and absorbs not just Smith’s book, but also Peikoff’s “Understanding Objectivism,” previously only available to the “inner cult” in expensive recorded format. The stale academic mainstream is going to have a problem on its hands, then. Those obnoxious undergrads are going to be fortified that much more; absent effective rebuttal from the mainstream academy, more of those students will enter grad school and wreak more of their “havoc.” Now, either this will be a bad thing in virtue of Rand being a weak philosopher, or this will be a good thing in virtue of Rand being not nearly the weak philosopher the cult of Rand-bashers makes her out to be. You can thank your lucky stars that these new generational waves will also be very big on Aristotle – in virtue of fundamental methodological similarities to Rand, which may be as fundamental a criterion for assessing a philosopher’s merit as any.
I, for one, don’t care to be on the losing side of history. You might want to be *damn* sure you know what you’re talking about re: “pseudophilosopher” Ayn Rand since I don’t see her conveniently going away anytime soon. (You might also consider just how truly mean-spirited and politically-motivated is the prominent blogger who directed traffic to your, um, flawed analysis. I’ve yet to see anything remotely resembling a fair, accurate, competent or objective commentary on Rand from that person in several years. It’s pathetic really given that person’s stature in the profession.)
Random,
I am preparing a response to several of the criticisms levied above. Please be patient; I have other responsibilities, including a small child, a dissertation, and undergraduate teaching. I will attempt to respond as best I can in the comment section. Until then, I am approving every single comment Objectivists submit (to the point where they have effectively taken over the comment section) so that readers of my piece may see the ‘other side.’
For the time being, while many critics have taken me to task for my characterization of Rand’s method as deductive, I remain unconvinced that I am wrong on this point, and the bulk of my forthcoming comments will focus on the issue. You also take me to task on my characterization of her ethics by going back to the text of her novels, and I will also have something to say here.
I do note, however, that no one–either here, or on the Reddit threads dedicated to the post–has spoken to the issues I present in the section on ‘the theory of second-best’ or my more general remarks on comparative methodology, which is a well-supported inductive argument about the epistemic reliability of piece-meal versus comprehensive, ‘total’ approaches. History is not kind to ‘systems.’
With some luck, my answers will be complete by this evening. After that, I cannot promise any further contribution; life is short, and, cognizant as I am of the total intellectual production of the species to this point, I really wish to move on to other things. There remains poems of Rilke I have not encountered, novels by McCarthy, I’ve been meaning to read Deleuze, and I do not for a moment believe the study of Rand is worth dropping these things.
(Incidentally, I should make it clear I do not think Rand is stupid–she seems, in effect, rather smart and clever, and certainly productive. The problem is that she–and her followers–insist on comparing her work to that of Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hume, and so on, and if that is the comparison class, I am afraid she falls short. As we all do. There are some interesting bits of her philosophy that might be salvaged. There are people I respect working on this (e.g. in the philosophy of science; I can name some names). But if the claim is that Rand’s philosophy, as a total system, is the most important and significant piece of theorizing in several thousand years, one that could ‘solve’ almost every open problem–from induction to value theory to political philosophy–then it is obvious to me that this is complete and utter nonsense. And I have already spent far too much time even thinking about it to worry about what anonymous Randians on the internet think, or whether I have besmirched her reputation with a ‘smear’ job.)
If you look at Sciabarra’s “Russian Radical” or – heaven forbid – Peikoff’s “Understanding Objectivism,” you’ll find plenty of evidence that Rand’s methodology is not deductive – that, in fact, Rand was not too keen on an induction/deduction dichotomy and that (in the tradition of Aristotle) she was (or ideally was) rigorously empirical at root.
(“Dichotomy” here I mean in the dualistic sense discussed by Sciabarra. Yes, there is the plain and commonsensical and strictly logical *distinction* between a process of induction and a process of deduction. However, Rand and Peikoff stressed the cognitive-methodological need to work back and forth between inductive and deductive modes to, shall we say, keep a check on both processes. This has something to do with what Peikoff in “UO” terms the “spiral,” that is, a ongoing systematic return to the perceptual level interwoven with one’s abstract theoretical modes of reasoning.
I think that any serious Rand scholar – someone on the steering committee of the Ayn Rand Society, say – would consider it unfounded (to put it gently) to ascribe to Rand this supposed deductive approach from “A is A” or the axioms. Have you read Rand’s statements on the cognitive role of axiomatic concepts? It’s in the online Lexicon, pretty easy to look up. The Lexicon, I’ll add, makes it increasingly difficult for her opponents to misrepresent her views and get away with it.
Random–
I do not have much time to spend on this, so I will write off-the-cuff, perhaps to your benefit (readers may take away that I am incapable of responding and take your view more seriously.)
So. I am not going to read this vast and sophisticated secondary literature on Rand you cite. That’s just not going to happen. Now you may argue that I have no business writing 8,500 word opinion pieces without having done so; and you are within your rights to accordingly lower your evaluation of my intellectual seriousness or sincerity. At every point in one’s life choices must me made about how to spend one’s time. Nothing said so far has convinced me that it would be profitable to read Sciabarra or Smith or Machan. These are hours I could spend on non-classical logic or formal semantics. Or any of a dozen thinkers and subjects.
It is not at all normal for a ‘philosopher’ to have a half-dozen privately funded institutes. Or to have such specific public policy recommendations that can be made sub specie aeternitatis: Rand cites no empirical research, conducts no study, gathers no data, merely asserts that she knows what monetary policy to follow. This is no way to go about the study of economics or political science. Again, nothing has been said about this argument because nothing can be said. If I fundamentally reject the idea that minimum wage laws can be evaluated from the armchair, then Rand is an intellectual curiosity at best and a useful obfuscation at worst.
It is also not normal for a ‘philosopher’ to have a complete system that claims to resolve practically every major open question in metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and political theory, and gains adherents with a closed system of self-reinforcing internal jargon that continually propounds her world-historical importance. This is the stuff of gurus and cults. There is literally no serious figure in modern intellectual history that even comes close to these kinds of grandiose claims. If you want to find someone like Dr. Brooks over at the ARI, then go to scientologists and see what they say about L. Ron Hubbard: “the greatest human that ever lived, the greatest genius to ever write,” and so on. It’s tedious.
Yes, some serious philosophers have grappled with her and perhaps produced interesting, useful little bits of actual philosophy. This is an inevitable by-product of the undeserved propagation and emphasis of her ideas. A philosophy department can attract a lot of outside money by being friendly to Rand. If a few million dollars were spent promoting the thought of some half-forgotten figure–Bradley, Whitehead–I’m sure we’d find all kinds of interesting things, because we’re paying good money to clever people to find interesting things. No money accrues to Whitehead because Whitehead didn’t spend a lot of time trying to convince people that the ‘welfare state’ should be liquidated. Only in America.
These sociological observations will not move you, or any of the ‘objectivists’ still reading the comment thread. Again, I hope the undecided and uncommitted think through this and reach their own conclusions. From my vantage point, it is pretty clear Rand was a smart figure who got in her own way. She might have made a decent thinker if she had any humility whatsoever. A damned waste, really.
(1) Identity, Method and Logic
What is the nature of the Randian argument? I’ve asserted it is a piece of deductive armchair reasoning. And further asserted that such armchair analysis cannot be expected to produce any reliable truths about the political, economical, and moral topics Rand discusses. In particular, I focused on the law of identity as exemplar of what is wrong-headed about the approach.
Let me re-angle the attack. I assume the following is not controversial:
a. Rand is explicit in her opposition to certain public policy. She advocates a minimalist state, implying a host of negative theses (do not enforce minimum wage laws, do not enforce child labour laws, and so on).
b. Rand is very explicit that her conclusions can be “proved by means of logic which can be demonstrated to be true and necessary.”
Yes, I realize the quote is from an interview, and not a ‘sophisticated’ 800-page book on Objectivism written by Serious People. Her words nevertheless have the virtue of being clear and succinct, and there is no question that she meant exactly what she said–even if it was compressed or simplified for a wide audience. But whatever was simplified in the background does not change the meaning of the words–a thesis that can be found again and again in her writings–that her conclusions are true, necessary, and logically demonstrable.
Do her conclusions follow necessarily from her premises? Yes? That’s a deductive argument. Point final.
Okay. Good. Now: I don’t think that, among the set of propositions that can be made about public policy in a modern western democracy there is a single logically-deducible necessary truth. Not a single one, not about health care, not about working conditions, not about safety regulations. You can’t get that from the armchair. And if you think there are, then you are quite mad. This is not rhetoric, either. I mean it. If you think that public policy is an armchair pursuit, only ideological capture could explain that fact. The kind of ideological spell that prevents useful information about the world to come in and interfere with the sinkhole of true belief.
You can’t determine whether some environmental regulation or other is a good idea by reflecting on first principles. I don’t care how much metaphysical or conceptual content is smuggled in. Identity could be the most sophisticated and complex congerie of neo-Aristotelian realism mixed with whatever epistemic requirements you want to build in: it is not going to work.
(If it is, as some commenters would have it, a sophisticated inductive argument, where are the experiments? What studies have objectivists conducted? What data do they cite? Oh, I can tell you right now: they proceed from how things seem to them about ‘human nature’ and ‘reality.’ If you ask them whether they think a paraconsistent logic might be an effective model of human ratiocination they would know right away that this is impossible. But you can’t know that. Not until you do the hard, boring work of, you know, science.)
So, I’m sorry, the first thing I am going to do is get rid of every single public policy recommendation objectivists make. Done, gone, out the window. For all any of us know moving towards the completely minimal state recommended could inflict untold harm to millions. You don’t know, I don’t know, and, as an empirical tinkerer, it is not the kind of thing I chance with. The method is not knowledge-producing and I stand by that. You could have the correct metaphysics of identity. I don’t care. You still don’t get government out of that and some hand-waving about the ‘value of life’ and ‘human reason.’ (“Harm, psharm! There is only one morally coherent government!”–this is the essence of the dispute, perhaps).
In any event, there is plenty of textual support that identity is treated a purely logical tautology sometimes and as an epistemic concept some other times, and a metaphysical truth some other times. No doubt much heavy lifting has been done to reconcile all this. In any event, I don’t care: even if Rand had her metaphysical ducks in a row, her political conclusions don’t follow.
Now, these putative axioms are top-heavy and ill-considered in any event. It is claimed that they are “implicit in all knowledge, and cannot be rejected without being relied upon in the course of the attempted rejection,” (from the SEP) but then we are told that identity also means that “[an entities] characteristics constitute its identity,” (that’s Peikoff) and so already we are in significant metaphysical trouble, since such a primitive identification of identity conditions with ‘characteristics’ is completely inadequate to the problems of contingency and modality (see, for example,) and those presented by physical science (see:). In other words: yes, I can reject the axioms. Maybe something different will have to take their place as we puzzle out the metaphysics of identity, that’s fine; the point now is that these ‘axioms’ are not final or indubitable or necessary or even particularly good solutions to philosophical problems.
I treated ‘A is A’ are logical because that is the only charitable thing to do: at least then it has the force of some intuition, give or take what Graham Priest might think, and it preserves the ‘necessary’ structure of the argument. But considered as a metaphysical principle it’s a complete non-starter. This is typical of her thought. (Her theory of reference is equally primitive: a concept is simply its referent, leaving us with no means to deal with e.g. substitution salva veritate in opaque contexts). She wants her conclusions to be inescapable, and dresses herself in the armature of logic and necessity, but when pressed avails herself of conceptual content that is, when not at least controversial, then obviously false.
(2) Context and Morality
Who are the ‘parasites’, indeed! Given the prevailing political uses to which Rand is put–and what social classes suffer from it–I cannot take seriously your exegetical work here. The upshot of the elimination of major parts of the welfare state, including public education, food stamps, and so on, would be to harm the poor, and not the morally compromised petite bourgeoisie or union bosses or whoever else is the ‘real’ target. I have no idea what you think the result of Rand’s politics is supposed to be. If her morality is the boring motivational ‘be true to yourself’, knock yourself out; I’ll be reading Stendhal meanwhile. but I cannot read all this talk of ‘parasites’ in any other way than as justification for indifference. Maybe in some alternate universe Rand opens up grand new vistas of voluntary charity and concern for the poor. In this world it is an excuse to sneer on ‘flu shots’ and food stamps.
On the issue of the pursuit of money. Roark’s time in the stone quarry might be a matter of personal integrity to him–showing that there are other, higher ideals–but narratively the purpose it serves is to underscore the mediocrity of the world he is thrust in, and in the end, Roark triumphs. The arc of the story is very old. If Rand had made the bold literary choice of having Roark cut stone the remainder of his days, a testament to his moral fibre, that would be one thing. But the hero does not remain in the underworld forever: instead, he finishes on top of his gleaming skyscraper (thus moral integrity is meaningless without the chance to act on it and build something). Was I guilty of lazy writing in the paragraph you mention about McGill? Maybe a little. Rand is not the Ferengi in Star Trek and I will cop to that charge. It was vulgar.
Finally, about ‘context.’ You say it is important, but I’ve quoted Rand on three occasions claiming that morality is a matter of black and white, and one of my central concerns was that, for Randians, no amount of general welfare could possibly justify exceptions to individual rights. I contrasted this to ancient virtue ethics, which certainly never conceived of public or private morality in this way, but reflected on the dispositions of character of ideally virtuous individuals: ‘imagine what so-and-so would do in this situation,’ in other words, and sometimes that might mean–I don’t know–an act of self-sacrifice, perhaps. Reflection on context is the morality, and not merely the truism that every particular moral judgement is made in some context or other.
With this, I am done with this thread. The new semester starts in a week and I will begin moderating comments more heavily–and likely not reply to any further discussion. Thank you, everyone, for reading..
You sure you want to let yours truly have the last word?
“I am not going to read this vast and sophisticated secondary literature on Rand you cite.”
Yeah! I’m only going to read her fiction – and what other people wrote about her! And then I am going to attack her entire philosophy based on that! Why do I need to have done any other reading in order to discredit her philosophy? Regurgitating the assertions of others rather than actually reading Miss Rand’s arguments on the ideas I attack is *much* easier. I’d rather do other things with my time than actually read about that which I am attacking as false! So I simply pass off that work to others and simply quote them!
Read Rand’s work in order to evaluate its truth? Are you kidding me?! First hand knowledge of that which I condemn? Who needs that?! And what do I care if you say it isn’t actually what she preached and practiced?! Like what SHE said actually matters here!!
–
As I said – NO honesty about Miss Rand and her ideas here.
“What is the nature of the Randian argument? I’ve asserted it is a piece of deductive armchair reasoning.”
No. You quoted someone else’s manufactured argument, rather than going to her and quoting her and her argument (which was the primary tactic you utilized through your whole blog post). In this case, the person you quoted claimed he had to make up this “deductive armchair” argument because she herself supposedly did not present it.
Of course, this is false.
So while you have indeed made an assertion, you have not made one pertaining to Miss Rand’s actual views. You have left her views unidentified and unrefuted.
That is the problem with straw men – and why they are fallacies.
.”
Since A Random Philosopher has no links to a blog, I take it that Mr. McGinnis is actually referring to my blog post here: In my brief explanation of Rand’s ethics, I made sure to provide evidence, via links, that what I was giving was actually Rand’s view, and not some skewed misinterpretation.
The politics consistent with the ethics I outline is still unregulated laissez-faire capitalism, because government robbery is not benevolence, and does not support good will among men. It forces people to reward indolence and incompetence, and produces a legislative war among pressure groups to get a big “piece of the pie” from the taxpayers.

i think the point Nicholas makes and which we saw in the B Leigh posts, professionally trained pro-rand(ian)s are an oxymoron and do not exist
cheers bubba
I’m adding a new favorite Randroid argument to my list:
1) “You disagree with me, therefore you don’t understand Rand’s ‘philosophy’.”
2) “You didn’t REALLY read her books and essays. Go read them again… you still disagree?” (defer back to 1)
3) Angry name calling (always a favorite)
4)!! “Read Rand’s disciples, they surely knew better what Rand REALLY meant.” (Last line of defense when 1,2,3 fail)
Brilliantly dishonest and inconsistent argument. Sorry to dive into a musical metaphor but it’s like deriving Paganini’s compositional style by analyzing Brahms’ “Variation on the theme of Paganini”.
P.S. Mr. McGinnis I beg you, pretty please, publish your essay so I can buy a hard copy of this brilliant and complete disembowelment of this pseudo-philosophy and thank you!

You can generate complete kingdoms all at once, including the ruler, motto, flag, currency, and a description of the capitol city. Or you can create each aspect separately, generating dozens of mottos or flags or cities at once and picking the ones that fit your kingdom.
The Kingdom Builder was written in .NET, which means that it will run on Windows XP or newer, plus any Mac or Linux machine that has an emulator for running .NET. (Some features, such as printing, might not work on emulators.)

The, his voice roaring out in the opening bars of a salty chanty. The haggard, scurvy-ridden crew join in a half-hearted chorus, dissolving into riotous laughter. Riggers and watchmen shout orders. The crew goes silent at the loud creak of a stately door that swings open on its rusty, salt-encrusted hinges. There is an awed silence as the captain surveys the deck, then a hurried return to work as he grunts in satisfaction and returns to his cabin. Once he's gone, the clattering of rolling dice can be heard as the crew bet what little booty they have. Lucky winners hoot in triumph while the losers bemoan their loss and accuse the other players of cheating. This is of course accompanied by the ringing of a drawn cutlass or the clicking of a cocked flintlock, which settles the argument. A monkey chatters somewhere in the rigging. A tropical bird makes demands about crackers from a man's shoulder.

When it comes to the
Constitution, G.T. Blankenship believes in following in the footsteps of the
founding fathers.
"I believe the
Constitution says what it meant to say; I don't believe it should be a living
document," said Blankenship, a self-described "strict constructionist."
"Too
often, the provisions of the founding fathers in our Constitution have been
eroded by judicial interpretation," he said. "The Constitution is the most
perfect document we have and should be followed to the letter as amended through
the years."
A former Oklahoma
attorney general, member of the state House of Representatives and a life-long
attorney, Blankenship will be the 17th recipient of the Constitution
Award at Rogers State University.
Blankenship, who also
is chairman of the University of Oklahoma Board of Regents, will receive the
award at a ceremony and luncheon on Sept. 15 on the RSU campus in Claremore.
He was selected to
receive the prestigious award by the RSU Constitution Award Board of Governors.
Marian P. Opala, vice-chief justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court and a member
of the Board of Governors, will present Blankenship with the award. Opala
received the award in 1996.
"We are proud and honored to
present Regent Blankenship with this distinguished award," said RSU President
Joe Wiley. "He embodies the virtue of respect that citizens of our country have
for their Constitution."
Each fall since 1987,
RSU has presented the Constitution Award to an Oklahoman who has demonstrated a
strong commitment to the principles of the Constitution through his or her
life's work.
The award has been presented to Carl
Albert, former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; Henry Bellmon,
former Oklahoma governor and U.S. senator; Adm. William J. Crowe, former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom;
David Boren, president of the University of Oklahoma, and former U.S. senator
and Oklahoma governor; Judge James O. Ellison, senior U.S. district court judge
for the Northern District of Oklahoma; and Alex Adwan, senior editor for the
Tulsa World. Last year, the award was presented to Judge Thomas R. Brett, senior
U.S. district court judge for the Northern District of Oklahoma.
Blankenship received a law
degree from OU in 1954. In 1960, he was elected to the state House of
Representatives and served as minority floor leader from 1964-66.
During his time in the House,
Blankenship was an integral part in uncovering one of Oklahoma's worst political
scandals. In 1965, Speaker of the House J.D. McCarty appointed a special
committee to investigate rumors of bribery involving members of the Oklahoma
Supreme Court. After the committee failed to bring forward evidence of guilt,
Blankenship presented his fellow House members with information that confirmed
the bribes. His announcement caused "pandemonium" on the House floor, he said,
and resulted in the resignation of one justice and the impeachment, conviction
and removal of another by the Oklahoma Senate.
Subsequently, Blankenship was
elected attorney general of the State of Oklahoma and served from 1966 until
1970.
Since then, he has been in
private legal practice in Oklahoma City and has served as chairman of the board
of the Bank of Nichols Hills. He also has served as chairman of the State
Centennial Committee, was on the board of directors for the U.S. Olympic
Festival, and has been active in the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce.
Blankenship was appointed to
the OU Board of Regents by Gov. Henry Bellmon in 1990 and was reappointed by
Gov. Frank Keating in 1997. He currently is in his last of 14 years (two terms)
on the OU Board of Regents, the governing board for RSU.
He and his wife Libby live in
Oklahoma City and have three adult children and seven grandchildren.
The
Constitution Award luncheon and ceremony are sponsored by the Bank of Commerce.
Tickets are $20 per person. To purchase tickets or get more information, call
the RSU development office at (918) 343-7773.

The Nova International event manager, Andy Caine, invited me to his home town, Newcastle to see the Bupa Great North Run (Sept 16) and for today, the Bupa Great North CityGames, sponsored by ASICS. The event has been fantastic.
Mo Farah, London 5,000m, photo by PhotoRun.net
20,000 people were in the center of the revitalized city of Newcastle, as a team of athletes from Great Britain and Northern Ireland competed against a team from the US in a winner take all match, which the US won, 6-3.
Mo Farah, tired from the World Champs, dropped from the half marathon to run the 2 mile invitational. A good time was had by all, as before and after the meet, held on the streets of Newcastle, 5k runs were run, with parents and youth also in youth runs.
This event should be run in the US. CityGames could be a big hit in the US.
In a well run, and well received sporting event, managed and developed by Nova International, the Bupa Great North City Games is the first day of a two day festival celebrating sport and fitness in Newcastle/Gateshead. Nova International, headed by Brendan Foster, the great British distance runner of the 70s (and only Olympic medalist in 1976, a bronze in the 10,000 meters), produces events such as the GreatRun, GreatSwim, GreatBike and Great CityGames all over Great Britain.
Brendan Foster runs businesses like he ran: straight ahead and building success with great teams and strong staffing. Foster and his former partner, John Caine, revamped Nike Europe in Nike's early days, and, moving on, built Nova International with a unique view for events.
Andy Caine, the Nova International meeting manager, built a strong team for GBR and Northern Ireland versus some tough athletes from the United States. At the end of the season it was tough to find good and healthy athletes, but the did.
The venue, along the river Tyne in between Newcastle and Gateshead, is the perfect venue: a revitalized inner city center.
The Mondo four lane track is 150 meters long and it took a team of nearly thirty four days to build up the sprint track, the long jump runway and the pole vault runway. The distance races, the mile and two mile were loops around the city center (two for the two mile), with a strong hill around 1000 meters and across the Millenium Bridge, which rises twice a day (a site to see).
Mo Farah, who was beat after the London Olympics, and now the birth of his twin daughters, Aisha and Amani in late August, dreamed of a relaxed race with, probably a group of senior citizens for his last race of the season. .However, Collis Birmingham, fresh off a 7:37 PB for 3,000 meters took Mo through 4:10 in the mile. Mo Farah waited until 500 meters to go, and right on the Sling Bridge, took off, winning in 8:40.0, with Bobby Curtis of the US taking Birmingham out of second place, Curtis running 8:42.8. " Collis was tough today, and I had cut back in my training, " noted Mo Farah, happy his season was over. " It is a great event and I wanted to see the fans who brought their kids out to see me today."
Jason Richardson, the silver medalist from London, and World Champ in 2011 in the 110 meter hurdles, gave Lawrence Clarke of GBR a quick lead. " I just sat there, then started hurdling" noted a smiling Jason Richardson. Richardson and Ryan Wilson caught Clarke about hurdle 4, and then Richardson took off, winning in 13.41 to Wilson's 13.48 to Clarke's 13.57. " I want to congratulate Aries Merritt who set the WR this season and competed with me all season long. Hurdlers compete against each other every week of the season. I think this brings more attention to our event." Jason Richardson, one of the most articulate athletes in any sport, has lot to say about making the sport more entertaining, and we will be interviewing him soon on his thoughts.
In the pole vault, Mary Saxer of the US won over Holly Bleasdale of Great Britain. Saxer cleared 4.25 m on her first attempt. Bleasdale did not clear 4.25m on three attempts.
In the long jump, Chris Tomlinshon, who shares the British record with Greg Rutherford, and sixth in the past two Olympics, won today in 8.18m, on his third attempt, a new CG record. Greg Rutherford, the Olympic champ, has a groin injury, which hurt more on the second and third attempts, jumped 7.89m on his fourth, to take second. " I am still getting used to the gold medal, " noted a smiling Greg Rutherford. " I wanted to compete here, as I was team captain and I love the event." Christian Taylor, gold medalist in the triple jump, was third here in 7.74m. Will Claye, bronze in Olympic LJ and silver in Olympic TJ, took fourth today here in 7.60m.
In the women's mile, Jenny Simpson of the US, World Champ at 1,500m in 2011, took the early lead, leading until 3:30. Hannah England, the WC silver medalist in 2011, took the lead. As the two dueled, Anna Pierce began her charge.
Unknownst to those three milers, Brenda Martinez, who had just run PBs in Zurich and Zabgreb in the 800 meters, breaking two minutes for the first times, charged past the field and won the race, on the track, in 4:34.99. Hannah England was second in 4:35.56 and Anna Pierce was third in 4:36.44.
" I have one more race to go this season, and that is the New York Fifth Avenue mile, " said a very happy Brenda Martinez. " My coach, Joe Vigil told me to have fun and relax. I was joking at the start!"
Jenebah Tarmoh won the 100 meters in 11.17, with Miki Barber in 11.37 in second, Aniyka Onura in third in 11.42 and Hayley Jones in fourth in 11.78.
Tarmoh who ran on the gold medal relay winning US team in London, ran a great racing, leading from the start.
Dwain Chambers had a great day, winning the 100 meters for men in 10.04. James Dasoulu took second in 10.15, with Darvis Patton of the US in third in 10.16 and Calesio Newman in fourth in 10.17.
Bernard Lagat, all of 37, won the mile in a tough battle with James Brewer of Great Britain. Lagat came alongside Brewer about three minutes into the race, as Brewer hung on and Jordan McNamara battled through the field, moving into third. Lagat won in 4:01.62, with Brewer in 4:01.81, a PB and Jordan McNamara in third in 4:02.86.
" I have one more race, the Fifth Avenue Mile next week, and then a break," Lagat told RBR last night.
Aniyka Onura of Great Britain came back from fourth in the 100 meters to win the 150 meters, hitting the 100m in 11.34, faster than her 100 meter time, to win in a fine 16.70. Shayla Mahan of USA ran 16.99 for second, with Miki Barber of the US in third in 17.02 and Margaret Adeoye of GBR in fourth in 17.11.
Ryan Bailey, who had seen a doctor last night, with a blocked saliva duct, lead through 50 meters in 5.82 and then dropped out. Marion Devonish took the lead with Christian Malcolm in second, as Wallace Spearmon woke up just about past the fifty meter mark, moving into second at the 100m (10.39), and took the win in 15.13, to Marion Devonish's 15.20 and Christian Malcolm's 15.50!
The US won 6 events to three, with one point for a win, and no points for second. A great event!
We want to see this in the US!

>Off the Beaten Path>Go Run
My wife babysits a little girl who just turned two. Her single mother works long days (not by choice). The kid watched me go on a run a few times, then one day walked up to me and said "go run". She wanted to go running. We have run to the blackberry patch behind the backyard, to the apple tree in the backyard, and once ran all the way around the house.
Nothing like starting them young.
Cool Jump Suit
Very nice! My kids have started running. They are a bit older (5 & 7), but they enjoy it. Especially the younger one. The 7 year old rides a bike, she prefers that now. Wow though, 2 years old!! I bet she wins her age group, huh.
The only differenceThat I seeIs you are exactly the sameAs you used to be
My little one is almost 3 and she loves to "Run like Mommy." She even did a kids 1 mile fun run last month. Granted, we sprinted/ walked and stopped to throw some rocks along the way but she made it and was proud of herself! We're all inspiring the next generation of obsessive

>Technical Support>Editing workouts is broken
Hi There,
Today I've noticed that I can't edit my workouts anymore. While hitting edit I see intervals data corrupted. It's distance seems to be ok, but Avg. HR column and HR max. shows some random values:
When I hit "Save", there's an error message shown: "The interval data is corrupt". However, preview tells me that workout data are absolutely fine:
So, there definitely something messed up when loading data to edit form. It happens not only for just imported workout. I've checked with one added few days ago (and edited then without any problems) and the same problem occurs.
Cheers,
ADi
Hi there, too
I'm also having this issue since today. If I try to upload a valid *.tcx file (I know it's valid, because I've exported it from Garmin Connect and there everything is fine), saving is impossible. Error message is "The interval data is corrupt".
If I only watch the file after importing with the glasses icon - and not saving it - I can see, that the tab with maps generates a lot of javascript errors. Maps won't get loaded at all.
Hopefully you can solve this issue. If you need my example tcx file, please let me know.
regards,
Christian
ADi3ek: could you please provide me with a list of steps to reproduce the problem?
cpmagin: please check your private messages. I sent you my email address so you can send me some files for testing. Thanks!
eric:
1. I go to my "Training Log" -> "Calendar" section and hit any run entry there.
2. Click "Edit" tab at the top of the entry (preview of interval data looks fine on that page)
3. "Edit workout entry" screen appers, interval data are broken here (no JS errors in the console though)
4. Hitting "Save" causes "The interval data is corrupt" error to apper.
I´m having the same problem. I'm uploading my workouts from the GPS Garmin Forerunner 910XT.
Running Blog: On my two feet
Hi guys,
I fixed the upload problem. It was caused by the server using your locale information to format the numbers (i.e. comma as the decimal separator) but the JavaScript expects a period instead.
ADi,
I think your problem has the same cause as the other one. Could you give it a try now and let me know if it's fixed? Thanks!
eric
I still have this problem. I agree it's some JS processing issue as I can see some "undefined" string inside interval data table:
I am still unable to reproduce the problem. Could you send me a private message with the following information:
- operation system and version
- web browser and version
- your regional settings (country and language)
- url to the broken that's broken
Thanks!
Eric,
I think it was some caching issue, I can see now the problem is fixed and everything works as expected. Thanks Eric! :-)
Hi ADi,
I'm glad to hear it's working now, although I don't understand why. The browser should not be cache anything. Please keep an eye out for it and let me know if something is still amiss.
Sure, I'll certainly do :-)
Works perfectly again!
Thank you Eric
for me it's working, too.
Thanks Eric for this fast support!

Old , Ugly and slow

I think it's like most things in life, "use it or lose it". While there is the inevitable erosion of absolute maximum potential, you can work on and reclaim some of that speed. My 12k race time this year was only 1 minute slower than when I was in my 30's, not that I was particularly fast back then, and my 100m sprint time now is only slower by just over 1 second from my 30's. I work at my running a lot more diligently these days in order to keep my speed.

Everyone's different but I think you're right on track.
For 25 years of my running marathons through age 58, I could still slip under four hours every once-in-a-whlle.
You don't want to hear what it is like now, 11 years later.
,
However, my main nemesis (also 69, but a slim/trim goddess), who was running the same four hour marathons with me when we met in 1990, just ran 3:58 at this summer's Light-at-the-end-of-the-Tunnel Marathon (compared to my six hours).
Tom, if you make your log public it would be easier to comment. Hard to respond without knowing what you're doing/what you've done.
Tramps i just changed it I did not know it was set to private.
I am hurt right now. This past year i have only been running 10-15 miles a week and lifting about twice a week.
I would like to get up to 30-35 in 2013 and start running faster. I know i also need to lose 25 to 30 pounds.

Hmmmm....sounds like you might have answered your own question here. Heal up, build a base, lose some weight, and THEN start thinking about speed. You may not have the speed you had 30 years ago but you might be surprised at what you're able to do!
Your mileage sounds a little low, but yes for those of use who have been running a while, yes, the speed fades. Training helps to a point but you gotta watch the injuries too, so it is a balance...
lump dum do di do do doh
Tom -
I lived in Charleston from 1981 to 1999. I ran the distance run in 1989. Are you still in that area? I actually still work for a company there: HealthSmart, formally Wells Fargo TPA, formally Acordia National, formally American Business Insurance, formally McDonough Caperton Insurance Group. (As you can see I've been working for them since 1984.)
I work remotely from Michigan and a few times a year I go down there for a week of meetings and stuff.
"Life is ambiguous." - Keith Richards
Sorry to buck the opinions of my elders. I have found my speed increased since 50 but then I didn't race much prior so perception is probably skewed. I also have to admit my injuries have increased as well even when I am careful and train right.
That said I found running 400 intervals on indoor track helped to improved my speed. Training with 40 something faster runners also helps.
Dad of a real runner
Sure, the age graded calculators at
would tend to indicate about a 1 minute 20 second slow down from 40 to 50 year olds who run a 5K around 20 minutes.
In addition to that slow down, I've also found it difficult (OK - damn near impossible) to put the same intensity into training that will get me to the same percentage on the age graded chart - so sort of a double wammy.
Dave i have lived in charleston my whole life. I first ran the distance run in 1977
and ran it untill 1991. From 2000 to 2007 i just did the 5k.

RUSH: Okay, what should the Republicans do about this? Republicans in Congress, Republican senators running for reelection, what should they do? The stories in the Stack of Stuff today do not show promise. Soul-searching Republicans turning to an unlikely savior, John McCain, as they try to stave off an electoral disaster. This guy is going to be running against his own party, and he's not even going to try for coattails. And they hope that his brand is better than the House Republican brand is, that they somehow will benefit, when in the New York Times a McCain aide says he's going to run against Bush and Congress. You know, I believe in going on offense. Offense, offense, offense, and I believe in being proactive, and I believe in not accepting the premise of the left. I don't believe in playing defense even when you're in the minority. They're looking now at a loss, a total difference of 70 seats in the House, if current projections by experts are right. The Democrats are going to have a 70-seat minority. When we took over the House in 1994, we won 52 seats. This is not incidental. This is quite substantial, this difference that might result here.
The first thing the Republicans have to do is rally their voters. They have to rally the troops, and they've gotta figure out -- they can obviously see that the troops are not rallied. They've gotta be able to see this with the lack of money they're collecting. They obviously can hear programs like this, read letters to the editor. I'm sure communications from the public to various congressmen and senators are sending them the message. See, the first thing you have to do is rally the troops. After you do that, then you make a case to the undecideds. It's time to take the gloves off where the Democrats are concerned. There have been no accomplishments, none, since the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in 2006. They did not end the war. They did not end earmarks. They did not increase our energy supplies. They didn't lower the price of anything. They didn't honor their own pay-go. They did not end the name-calling and the negativity. They didn't increase homeland security, and in fact they did everything they could to decrease it.
In addition to making the case for yourself and your own principles, you've got to go after them, and you have to tell the truth about them. They're out there, all these madcap promises that they made after winning in '06, and they haven't delivered on any -- well, minimum wage, sorry. With all their talk and all their slogans and all their Barbra Streisand, their signature triumph was raising the minimum wage, and wasn't that a triumph for the ages, as though that had never been done before. During these same two years, the vilified president of the United States changed the dynamics in Iraq with a Petraeus strategy, not just the surge, but the strategy, and even the left is now learning -- they're not admitting it -- that military success is leading to political success. What Republicans are going to have to do is to be unafraid in reminding people of the overall consistent failures of liberalism and then stand up for who they are, stand up for conservatism. They can do it by reciting principle; they can do it by reciting American exceptionalism; they can come up with an agenda of items, if they wish, to talk about they want to get done.
There's any number of things. The thing is, you can't pile too many of these in there like McCain's done because it's just going to sound impossible, and you put too many in, you can't focus on any of them. The American people want leadership. Both parties -- independents, Republicans, moderates, conservatives -- everybody wants leadership, and there isn't any. There's a vacuum, and it's just waiting for somebody to move in with leadership, to speak with authority, to not care what anybody thinks about it, to advance an agenda that is pro-America, based on American exceptionalism and the US Constitution and basic human rights. You start talking about freedom, start talking about liberty, those are two words I do not hear in any campaign running for the White House. I don't hear it in Hillary's campaign; I don't hear it in Obama's; I don't hear it in McCain's. Freedom, liberty, the expansion of same. Talk about how the United States is not responsible for the destruction of the planet. The United States is the answer to the world's problems.
Do not fall in with this stupid hoax of global warming, which is nothing more than an attempt to advance liberalism and socialism and Big Government, as we discussed, I'm blue in the face on this. Stand up and reject all these premises, say you've had enough even if it means breaking with the so-called direction of your party. You Republicans of elected office, I would submit your party doesn't have a direction. There's somebody out there waiting to give it one. Senator McCain is not giving the Republican Party a direction. He is not giving it an identity. He is trying to change all of that. And that's another problem that we have. There's a vacuum waiting to be filled. All it takes is guts and courage and instinctive conservatism. This shouldn't even take any homework to figure out what to say. It ought to be in your heart.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: This is Lauren, one of my all-time, top-ten favorite female names. Lauren is in Carson City, Nevada. Lauren, nice to have you on the EIB Network. Hello.
CALLER: Dittos, Rush.
RUSH: Thank you.
CALLER: The reason I'm calling is because you're saying that you want to be proactive in everything and I'm wondering why we don't have an Operation Shove It. Why, on a certain day, we don't call for all conservative Republicans to leave the party and go Libertarian.
RUSH: I'm not looking at that as a solution. I don't think third party is the way to go here. But your question is really larger than that. Your question is, "Rush, why don't you do something?"
CALLER: Exactly.
RUSH: Why don't you have us do something? National Review magazine, back in -- what year was this, Snerdley, 1992? Maybe '93, they had a cover story, National Review, on me as the leader of the opposition. You obviously think that that's still true today, right, Lauren?
CALLER: Obviously, from Operation Chaos, too, I think. You know, Rush, I couldn't vote for John McCain if Jesus Christ himself was his running mate. But I don't know what to do. And it is so frustrating from my point of view because I honestly have always prided myself on voting for the president and being able to vote, and I'm sick about it.
RUSH: Have you always been conservative, always been Republican?
CALLER: Yes, and I'm a homosexual as well. So I'm very, very rare as far as that goes, but it just makes me sick to have to think that I literally would have to plug my nose.
RUSH: Look, I understand the frustration, and I'm hearing it everywhere. We had a call from a woman in Michigan about an hour-and-a-half ago, hour-and-20 minutes ago who was a Reagan Democrat. She was converted to conservatism back in the eighties by Ronald Reagan, and she felt like her life had opened up. She'd had an awakening. She felt happier about herself and her country than she had in a long time. Now she thinks the party's abandoned her and she doesn't know what to do, either. This is what's really tragic about this, and what I was going to say before I took your call, and I'm glad you called, I'm sitting here, folks, and I know many of you say, "Well, do something. Tell these guys to do something." There is a fine line. I have an attitude sitting here. I don't think these guys -- I certainly know McCain isn't going to listen to anybody. John Boehner the other day was talking about perhaps a conservative manifesto. He's the minority leader in the House. I like these guys, and there's some really, really good ones there. Mike Pence from Indiana in the House of Representatives, who is fabulous. But these guys are in the minority, and the problem is that when the leader of the party -- give you an example -- I'm sorry to be hopscotching all around here, but this is admittedly as frustrating for me as it is for you.
Romney was on TV earlier today, and who was it that I saw on TV that was trying to -- oh, it was George Allen, might have been on Hannity's show on Fox, Hannity & Colmes. George Allen was on the day McCain gave his global warming speech, and he was just struggling to support, to say good things about it, to say good things about McCain, and I got instant message flashes and e-mail flashes from friends of mine who happened to also be watching. And they said, "What's he doing? Why is George Allen selling out?" And I wrote 'em all back, and I said, "You have to understand, if he wants a future in the Republican Party, he cannot break away here. The party apparatus will shun him." This is the problem when the leader of the party is not either a conservative, or in some cases, not even a Republican. So the Republicans down the stream and the presidential candidate is the putative head of the party. The president is the head of the party, but that starts to wane as the campaign season gets closer to the general.
So you have the time-honored history of falling in line with the party. The party comes first. If you have the top of the party taking it in a direction that people don't want it to go, and you are elected, and you're in the House, for example, and you gotta run for reelection, you've gotta tie yourself to the top of the ticket. As the news story today said, these Republicans are looking at McCain as their savior, they're not looking at themselves as their savior. When I read that story, that House Republicans -- well, McCain's brand is better than our brand right now, we're going to attach ourselves to him -- that spoke volumes. It said the primary purpose is to get reelected. But then it also said they haven't the slightest clue how to do it. We have lost three seats, three special elections, and two of them were in safe-seat districts, districts where George Bush had won by 20 points. Now, I know in this Mississippi race, what happened was that the Democrats went into black churches and they passed out a pamphlet saying that our guy, Greg Davis, was a member of the KKK. They did that the Sunday before the election. And it might have been a factor. Probably was. How long have we known that this is what Democrats are going to do? To be blindsided by something like this, you know, it's gotten to the point where this should have so outraged the party rather than depressed them, it should have so outraged them that somebody in this party, preferably our nominee, would stand up and decry all of this.
The Democrat Party is the party of 150 years of racism and segregation and Jim Crow. The Democrat Party is. The Democrat Party stood in the way of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A larger percentage of Republicans in the Senate voted for that than Democrats, enabling it to pass. But there's such fear. And when fear is the thing that guides your decision making, the odds are you're going to make the wrong decision well over half the time. I don't want to say I don't know what can be done, but I think if it's not in these guys' hearts, if it's not in their minds, 'cause nobody can put it there. Try to inspire these people to do the right thing, to understand what kind of success awaits them. You would think that they would see it. You would think that it would be as obvious as the sky is blue why they lost in '06, what they have to do to avoid losing in '08. But I maintain to you, and I've said this way too many times, I think Washington poisons people. You go there and after awhile you lose the worldview that you had before you got there. The whole social and political structure, media importance in Washington takes over, and your instincts tell you to do things that enable you to survive there rather than do what's necessary to keep getting elected and advance an agenda.
To us outside Washington, it seems so simple, and we don't understand why they can't see it, especially when they used to because we remember how they campaigned, remember what they said, remember the way they used to govern. What happened? And this is sort of what is inexplicable. So we start searching for answers, we throw our hands up, it doesn't make any sense, I don't understand it. What's happening is very simple. The Republican Party has long been constituted by people who resented conservatism, resented Ronald Reagan, resented the whole notion. I've been through this. They are embarrassed at certain elements of the conservative movement being in the Republican Party. They are from the Northeast. They have this Northeast-Washington-Boston axis and corridor mentality, government's the answer to everything, government is power, and they seek it; whereas conservatives don't want anything to do with government except to get it out of our lives, make it smaller and make it as invisible as it can be in our daily lives. But even Republicans have the desire and notion to be a part of it because of the power that's involved and so forth.
So I think that there's a combination of efforts here on the part of both of parties to rid the influence of conservatism. What's frustrating about this obviously is that we look at Republicans, we say, "Don't you see history? Can't you see where we have been predominantly successful, overwhelmingly landslide proportion successful? Didn't you see what it took to get the American people on our side in advancing the country forward," and all of that past is simply discarded. And now for whatever reason, more Republicans than ever seem to think that the way to power is the same route the Democrats take: Big Government and offer more of it to more people. Conservatism is something that embarrasses them and they want to discard it and have it be as irrelevant as it could be. The problem for us as conservatives is the conservative movement is a great thing, but in our political system you need a political party to advance the ideas. So the effort that we face here, the objective is to make sure that we don't lose control of the Republican Party. I'm not talking about this year. I mean, take a look at the possibilities here, and in terms of conservatism, if we really believe that conservatism is the answer, is the best thing to hold onto this country as we've known it and loved it, that it is the best way to organize ourselves under capitalistic free-market principles, liberty, justice and all that, pursuit of happiness, your kids and grandkids and so forth, then it's something you fight for life.
This is something you endeavor to support and see to the end, knowing full well we're going to have ups and down cycles like this. I mean if I wanted to, I could pretend I'm a National Honor Society candidate, I could say, "Look where we were back in the sixties compared to where we are now. We're far better than we were in the sixties, we were getting shellacked." But people don't want to hear that because the down cycle is what we're in the midst of and they want to reverse the down cycle now, don't tell me about the stuff in the past. We got way past that, now we're giving it back. I understand. May have to give a lot of it back. So let me give you a couple scenarios. Barack Obama wins the White House, has a 70-seat majority in the House of Representatives, a seven-seat majority in the Senate, gets pretty much everything he wants, and we end up with Jimmy Carter 2 and the country goes to hell in a handbasket, and who gets the blame? Well, it can't be us, it can't be conservatives, even though the Drive-Bys will try to lay it at our feet, we'll have no power.
Same scenario, but with John McCain in the White House, a Republican, and the country goes to hell in a handbasket because this lofty agenda that McCain spoke about today is not going to happen because he's not going to get any support for it and they're not going to bend over forwards and let McCain have whatever he wants. He's going to have to get things done as he says on the basis of a liberal Democrat agenda and of course he's done that on many occasions, issue by issue by issue. So we get Jimmy Carter 2 with John McCain and the Democrats running the show. But, the party in power is the Republican Party, and they get the blame. The Republican Party takes the heat for whatever rotten things happen in those four years. Of which those two scenarios, is better for the future of conservatism?

Popular Flip-Flop Sandals Linked To Rising Youth Heel Pain Rate
Many of us are welcomed the warmer weather by sporting flip-flop sandals, however, their popularity among teens and young adults is responsible for a growing epidemic of heel pain in this population, according to Dr. Brown, a member of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.
“We’re seeing more heel pain than ever in patients 15 to 25 years old, a group that usually doesn’t have this problem,” said Dr. Brown. “A major contributor is wearing flip-flop sandals with paper-thin soles everyday to school. Flip-flops have no arch support and can accentuate any abnormal biomechanics in foot motion, and this eventually brings pain and inflammation”.
Dr. Brown advises wearing sandals with reasonably strong soles and arch support. “Especially for girls and young women, thicker soled sandals with supportive arches might not be considered stylish, but if you want to wear sandals most of the time, you’ll avoid heel pain if you choose sturdier, perhaps less fashionable styles”.
It is estimated that 15 percent of all adult foot complaints involve plantar fasciitis, the type of heel pain caused by chronic inflammation of the connective tissue extending from the heel bone to the toes., or irritation of one or more of the nerves in the region.. Therefore, diagnosis by a foot and ankle surgeon to rule out other causes is advised.
Initial treatment options for heel pain caused by plantar fasciitis should include anti-inflammatory medications, padding and strapping of the foot and physical therapy. Patients also should stretch their calf muscles regularly, avoid wearing flat shoes and walking barefoot, use over the counter arch supports and heel cushions, and limit the frequency of extended physical activities.
Most patients with plantar fasciitis respond to non-surgical treatment within six weeks. However, surgery is sometimes necessary to relieve severe, persistent pain.
For further information about heel pain, contact Dr. Lawrence Brown at 586-758-5770 in CenterLine Michigan.

Broad US Stockmarkets - Time for Retail Investors to Get Fleeced (again)
I have been watching the continued advance of the broad stockmarket since the US elections with a kind of morbid fascination. Despite the horrific fundamentals, the market has continued higher, yet, as I already dramatically demonstrated a couple of weeks ago by means of a Dow chart in Euros, this rally is nothing more than a "damp squib" in real money terms. The complacency in this market is truly incredible, given the drop in yields to a pitifully low level, and the fact that the market has risen into an area of truly massive overhead supply that would make even an 8-year old budding chart analyst nervous.
More ominous still is the fact that insiders have been unloading stock onto retail buyers at an ever-expanding rate that has risen to extreme levels in recent weeks. Ordinary investors have been corralled into the pen once again, seduced by slick marketing campaigns and glossy long-winded brochures, and are now helplessly awaiting their fate, which is, of course, to be fleeced.
We will now examine the charts for the broad US stock markets, focusing mainly on the Dow Jones Industrials, because there was a potentially very significant volume development on Friday. I would rather look mostly at the S&P500, which is more representative of the market as a whole, but there is no volume data available for this broader index.
A two-year time period has been selected for our 1st chart, in order to show the run-up from the March 03 low in its entirety and also the toppy action all this year. On this chart we can see that the index broke out from the gentle downtrend channel in force all year, upon the Republican party securing, apparently with the aid of more than a little tweaking of the latest vote counting technology, a clear, if marginal victory in the election in early November. This breakout, however, is regarded as a sucker rally, as it is driving into massive overhead resistance and is accompanied by frenetic insider selling.
Thus it is most interesting to observe that the market fell on Friday on huge volume - the heaviest for well over 3 years, the heaviest in fact since the fall 01 selling climax, from critical resistance bang on the highs of February of this year and March 2002. So it looks like Santa's going on strike this year, as least as far as stockmarket investors are concerned. Christmas is a time when people's normal judgement is suspended, frequently resulting in a rally based on hope not substance, and facilitated by the low volumes that prevail over the holiday period. Friday's move signifies that, at the very least, a short-term top is in all probability in.
The long-term chart going back 10 years is horrific. It shows the market stalled beneath a massive wall of supply from the 1999 - 2001 highs. Given the magnitude of this resistance, the fact that the market has risen as far as it has is impressive indeed - until, that is, you stop to think what's happened to the currency over the last several years. Factor that in and you realize that its performance has in reality been anaemic.
The S&P500 chart is also a grim picture showing the index now into a zone of heavy supply from the top area.
The long-term Dow chart in Euros should bring home to US investors how meager the latest rally in US indices has been in terms of real gains.
The trigger for a plunge in the general stockmarket is expected to be the fairly sudden realization that interest rates are set to rise substantially. As the stockmarket normally discounts developments 6 to 9 months ahead of their actual occurrence, rates might not actually begin their steep ascent for many months after the market falls. The probable cause of the rising rates is likely to be the continued depreciation of the currency necessitating higher interest rates to maintain capital inflows.
The increasing risk of a big sell-off in the broad market, coupled with the fact that the gold stock indices have marked out a potential double-top, gives grounds for caution at this time, as precious metal stocks could get caught up in the melee and taken down temporarily - which is why, in general, we will be careful about re-entering the market following our general stop in the HUI being triggered about 10 days ago.

Base Metals Stockpiles and Prices 2
Just a few years ago, the majority of stock traders were oblivious to the excitement that base metals had to offer commodities stocks. Futures traders hustled and bustled to make a buck in their familiar base metals marketplace, yet not even they were aware of the eruption of capital that would eventually take these markets by storm.
Today the London Metal Exchange (LME), the world's largest non-ferrous metals exchange, manages over $10 billion of traded contracts each day with well over $2 trillion worth turned over annually. These are numbers that the LME says have increased by tenfold in the last 15 or so years. And it expects another double in the next three to five years.
A major catalyst to this growth stems from our growing global economy that has triggered a massive increase in the demand for industrial metals. These metals are responsible for expanding and renewing the world's physical infrastructure and are integral to the products and machinery that keep the wheels of global commerce greased.
And the demand for these industrial metals, or base metals, should continue to grow for many more years. Since the supplies of these metals are finite, and they are lagging to meet demand, base metals prices have been on a tear in recent years. The physical metals and the stocks of the companies that mine them have greatly rewarded investors and speculators thus far.
Now though it is very probable that the base metals will thrive in a secular bull market for many years to come, prudent traders need to be on top of current market conditions in order to stay ahead of the curve. And a wonderful attribute of the base metals in addition to their solid strategic fundamentals is their tactical and measurable real-time fundamentals.
These fundamentals are found in data that is provided by the LME. And the LME is one of the first places I go to gauge the health of the base metals sector as it is the leader among the global metals exchanges in capturing some of the core fundamentals of the base metals markets.
Not only is the LME the most reliable source for daily base metals prices in the world, but its various other functions are essential for commodities speculators. One such function includes providing the markets for futures and traded-options contracts. Aside from the speculative nature of futures and options, they are essential in mitigating risk allowing both consumers and producers to lock in prices, also known as hedging.
But the major function of the LME that I will focus on today surrounds the physical storage of its traded contracts. Now in order to ensure price convergence, all contracts traded on the LME "assume" physical delivery. Even though only a small percentage of contracts actually result in delivery, this physical realm is very important in the futures markets.
Since hedging and speculation dominate trading in the LME, a majority of contracts are sold or bought back before coming due for settlement. But LME contracts are occasionally redeemed and settled through the redemption of LME warrants. These warrants allow the bearer to obtain lots of a given metal from LME-approved warehouses around the world.
This physical storage is not designed to supersede existing supply chains such as those that exist between refineries and end users. But since global above-ground stockpiles are limited, when physical deliveries do occur to meet excess demand they really help paint a picture of the global supply and demand balance for the base metals. This action ultimately plays a large role in determining the day-to-day metals prices.
Today the 400+ LME-approved warehouses scattered across 13 countries provide critical stock data that not only the LME but traders around the world use to gauge the health of the metals markets. This stock data is published daily by the LME and as you will see in the upcoming charts is very useful as a leading indicator for the price action of the metals.
A couple weeks ago I penned an essay that analyzed the base metals technicals. Copper, zinc, nickel, lead and aluminum are the primary base metals that pique the interest of equity traders and are the most exciting in the volatile futures markets. Each of these metals is in the midst of its own secular bull market and their technical actions thus far have been simply mind-blowing to witness.
Sans aluminum, each of the base metals has had bull-to-date gains that have well outperformed the precious metals and the majority of the energy complex. Some incredibly strong uplegs have been host to wild parabolic ascents that have taken investors on exciting rides.
But in viewing the technicals it has been hard to establish a semblance of any trading patterns. I believe a large reason for this is the base metals' reactionary nature to the real-time fundamentals of inventory data. Because above-ground stockpiles have crept so low in recent years, speculative risk premiums have been built into the base metals prices. So when there is a swing in the stock data that the LME in particular provides, the markets are quick to react.
Because of this it is worth a visual look at the stock and price charts of the base metals in order to better understand this relationship. In the first edition of this base metals stockpiles and prices series that I wrote last year, copper was coming off a near double in the first half of 2006 as its LME-warehoused stock sunk to alarmingly low levels. From early March to its May top, copper rose 83% while copper stock dropped 33% to its early July lows.
Then after a somewhat uneventful price and stock consolidation through October, a near-textbook-perfect inverse correlation started to play out. In less than four months, copper stockpiles nearly doubled while copper corrected sharply shedding a third of its value.
This run had a very strong negative correlation of -0.949 with an r-square of 90%. So 90% of the daily behavior of copper prices could be explained or predicted by the movement of its daily LME stock level. This copper correction had a very impressive inverse correlation with LME copper stock and this correlation has continued into copper's most recent upleg that began in early February.
Since its early February interim bottom, copper has had an impressive rally of 55% to its recent highs. And this has happened in unison with a 24% drop in copper stockpiles. This upleg is sporting a copper-to-stock correlation of -0.956 with an r-square of 91%. Not many fundamental drivers have had such measurable real-time correlations with an underlying asset as copper and many of the base metals do to their LME warehoused stocks.
Aside from these short-term correlations, it is also important to maintain strategic perspective on the stockpile data. Even though a double from 100k to 200k metric tons seems like a major structural change in LME copper stock, it is still historically very low. In 2002 LME copper stock was near the one-million-metric-ton level. So while 100k metric tons seems like a large supply increase in these short-term charts, today's levels are still 80% less than just five years ago. This is all the more impressive considering how much larger the global copper market is now compared to back then.
When looking at stock levels I think it is also important to consider the daily consumable supply above ground. For copper the 170k-metric-ton range puts it at less than four days worth of global copper consumption available. It is no wonder speculative risk premiums exist in copper and the other base metals. Any supply disruption would surely pinch the markets, which is why the recent labor problems at the massive Grasberg mine in Indonesia and many of the huge Chilean copper mines have been getting so much attention.
Shifting to zinc, it had an amazing 2006 run as its LME warehoused stock plunged in sharp linear fashion. A sizeable supply and demand imbalance emerged last year as LME warehouses were pilfered of nearly all the zinc consumers could get their hands on.
In 2006 LME zinc stock dropped an incredible 78%. And from its 2004 high of 780k metric tons, zinc stock has plunged a once-inconceivable 89% to its December lows. With its stock so low, on the order of less than three days of global consumption available, 2006 zinc prices skyrocketed by 142%.
This powerful zinc upleg finally gave up its ghost as zinc stock levels put the brakes on its freefall and began to stabilize toward the end of last year. Though zinc stock levels still remain historically low as they hover around the 100k-metric-ton level, a chunk of the speculative risk premium built into its price while it was freefalling was shaved off the top in quick fashion.
From its November high, zinc corrected by 34% in just 51 trading days to rest in what looks like an uptrending consolidation band near the highs of its early-2006 parabola. I find it amazing that stable zinc stock, no matter how low it is, is able to quickly quell the zinc-stock-to-zero sentiment that speculators built into zinc's price. This just confirms the incredible volatility in the base metals markets which really supports the importance of the hedging function for the end users and some of the weak-stomached producers of these metals.
Now nickel is a base metal that really captures the essence of the value the markets place in LME stock levels. Its supply deficit in recent years has truly been felt by the nickel industry. The warehouses that store LME-approved nickel have seen their inventory levels drop to dangerously low levels. Because of this nickel has truly become a hot commodity. Bull to date the price of nickel has soared over 1,000%!
LME nickel stock below 5k metric tons is equivalent to only about one day worth of global nickel consumption. An above-ground surplus of this small of an amount is just unthinkable. This poses a huge risk on the demand side of things as any increase in consumption will really pinch this market. And the financial markets are fully aware of this dilemma.
In 2006 alone, LME nickel stock fell by 89% prompting a wild nickel rally that saw this metal balloon by a massive 162%. And nickel's fortunes did not stop there with 2007 adding another 60% to recent highs as stockpiles continue to dwindle.
A huge speculative risk premium has been added to the price of nickel as the global nickel shortages continue. This further shows that fundamentals not only shift long-term price action but they can exert immediate and impactful pressure on real-time prices.
As I described in my base metals technicals essay two weeks ago, lead provides yet another example of the fundamental impact stockpiles can have on the technical nature of the metal price. While the other base metals were shedding weight in the warehouses and enjoying strong rallies last spring, lead bucked the trend and took a course of its own.
When you look at an LME lead-stock chart it becomes apparent why this was the case. In the first half of 2006 lead stockpiles actually rose by an impressive 181%. Lead subsequently shed 37% in this timeframe until it hit its interim bottom in June. And of course almost like clockwork, as LME lead stock started to fall the price of lead began to rise.
Since its June low, lead has been one of the strongest-performing base metals in the last ten months. With LME lead stock falling headlong by a whopping 74%, the price of lead has rocketed higher by a very impressive 124%. And though not as strong as copper, lead's inverse correlation through the span of this chart is an impressive -0.898 with an r-square of 81%. With less than two days of global daily consumption available in the warehouses, the markets really must pay attention to stockpile levels.
Aluminum is last but certainly not the least of the base metals. Measured by volume, more aluminum is produced and consumed each year than the previous four base metals combined. It is hard to tell in this short-term chart below, but aluminum has had a nice run since its 2001 low gaining 145% to its high last year.
With LME aluminum stock all over the board in the last year and a half or so, aluminum's price has been relatively stable outside of its May spike last year. Though the supply and demand for aluminum has greatly increased in recent years, there has not been as much of a pinch on the mining-side of things due to its abundance in massive ore bodies around the globe and the scalability of some of the larger mines.
This can be seen in aluminum's price stability amidst swings in its stock levels. Even with a recent 25% rise in stock, aluminum has been very stable in the last six months. As you can see in the chart its price has remained in a tight consolidation band and has not tanked based upon the parallel change in its stock level.
Even though LME aluminum stock levels are down from the 1.4 million-metric-ton range in early 2004, the above-ground supplies of the metal as measured by LME stock are not as alarmingly low as the other metals. Therefore the speculative risk premium attached to the other base metals is not as prevalent in aluminum as seen by its bull-to-date performance and its less responsive behavior to swings in its warehoused stock levels.
Any way you look at it, whether in aluminum or the more supply-pinched copper, zinc, nickel and lead, economics have and always will be the ultimate price driver for these commodities. The LME stock data really helps us to focus in on real-time economic fundamentals in these exciting base metals markets.
So as the global economy continues to grow in order to support its growing population as well as the fast-developing countries of Asia, commodities demand in general should continue to grow. With the dynamics of mining playing such a large role in supplying the markets' demands for the base metals, it should continue to be a wild ride for investors and speculators in the coming years.
And the best way to take part in the base metals bull is to buy the stocks of the companies that are charged with bringing these metals to the markets. The base metals mining stocks have been among the hottest stocks in the stock markets in recent years and have greatly rewarded shareholders thus far.
But this base metals bull market is likely far from over. Probabilities highly favor today still being in the first half of a secular bull market for the base metals that should thrive for another decade or so. Because of this, legendary gains are still likely to be won in the base metals stocks.
At Zeal we have been recommending elite base metals stocks among other commodities stocks to our newsletter subscribers since the beginning of this bull market and have been blessed with some incredible realized and unrealized gains. If you'd like cutting-edge commodities markets analysis and trade recommendations for high-probability-for-success stocks, then please subscribe today to our monthly newsletter.
Our newsletter subscribers also gain exclusive access to the private charts section of our website. With LME stock data proving to be a very important metric for traders to observe, we recently added high-resolution versions of the charts seen in this essay to our charts section and update them weekly so you may monitor these base metals fundamentals yourself.
The bottom line is the recent inverse correlation between base metals prices and their LME stock levels is proving to be an exceptionally valuable tool for base metals traders to observe. With the tight supply of base metals in today's markets, any swing in stock levels has greatly influenced these metals' price actions.
The fundamental drivers of the base metals bulls are real and measurable with this LME data. And investors and speculators should be able to capitalize on this supply crunch by buying the stocks of the companies that bring the base metals to market. With stockpile levels so low and continued demand growth on the horizon, the base metals miners are poised to be marvelously profitable for years to come.

SAG's Residuals Department prides itself on processing members' residuals in the fastest and most efficient way possible.
Due to limited resources, however, SAG can no longer "expedite" residual checks—a process where the production information associated with the payment is mailed separately from the check.
As a result, effective immediately, the double mailing will cease. TV and theatrical residual payments will now be processed in a single mailing, with the payment and production information sent together. Members should expect to receive their residuals within 60 days from the date SAG receives the checks and producers’ information. Members are encouraged to track the status of their TV/Theatrical residuals by registering on the SAG website at.
Despite the challenges presented by limited resources, the Guild will strive to ensure that members receive their residual payments within the quickest possible timeframe.

Gov. Benigno R. Fitial and Lt. Gov. Eloy S. Inos, in conjunction with USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA), and through the CNMI Department of Commerce, are pleased to announce loan opportunities for farming related activities. Activities include a wide range of livestock and crops.
According to Fred A. San Nicolas, assistant manager for USDA-FSA's Farm Loan Program, “FSA provides loan opportunities through two primary programs. The first one is the Guaranteed Loan Program, where conventional lenders (the banks) lend to applicants with a 90-percent loan guarantee backed by the USDA-FSA. The second is through Direct Loans, where loans are made and serviced directly by FSA. The average annual percentage rates can change month to month, but remains fixed once the loan is closed.”
Commerce deputy secretary Ivan A. Blanco added, “These types of opportunities are a breath of fresh air for our local entrepreneurs. The administration, through Secretary Igisomar, continues to support these types of programs with the partnership of our Small Business Development Center (SBDC) to assist the local Sabalu Farmers Association and family size farms. I also applaud the initiative by the USDA-FSA to provide these types of opportunities for those already in the farming sector and those interested in farming.”
For further information, please visit the USDA-FSA website at:
In addition, you may contact Fred A. San Nicolas via email: fred.sannicolas@pb.usda.gov or by phone toll free at 234-0896. (Office of Governor)

A Victoria’s Secret star’s model breast-feeding
Orlando Bloom shoots intimate image of wife Miranda Kerr with their son -- and the Internet voices support
Topics: Motherhood, Celebrity, Life News
You don’t have to look too far on the Internet to find images of Miranda Kerr showing some skin. She is, after all, a Victoria’s Secret model. But a fairly modest image of domestic bliss, shot by husband Orlando Bloom, is rapidly becoming the most buzzed-about image of the Australian beauty. In it, she smiles sleepily in bed, her robe partially open — while infant son Flynn nuzzles contentedly at her breast.
That’s right — these things aren’t just for filling out sweaters, slipping out at awards shows, and good times with close friends. Though it’s easy to forget in our cleavage-obsessed culture, breasts are what put the mamm in mammals. But while Kim Kardashian’s bralessness is headline-making news and Olivia Munn’s assets are the highlight of her talk show appearances, a woman using her rack for something other than an attention-getting accessory is often met with everything from discomfort to outright hostility. In 2007, Bill Maher famously ranted that “breast-feeding is an intimate act, and I don’t want to watch strangers performing intimate acts.” Earlier this month, Facebook found itself in the midst of yet another controversy regarding its absurd knee-jerk response to breast-feeding photos when it deleted — twice — the page for the Leaky B@@b support group for violation of terms of service. And the public appetite for stories about Natalie Portman’s pregnancy or John Travolta’s new baby or who looks like she’s sporting a baby bump this week is damn near insatiable. But the beauty of breasts and their usefulness in parenting rarely cross paths in the public eye..”
It wouldn’t be the Internet if a few people didn’t have negative opinions, summed with the classic, “I would NEVER breastfeed in public…we are humans not animals” and ” it’s a private thing…so let’s keep it private!” Yet the outpouring of huzzahs for the beautiful photo, Kerr’s honesty about drug-free childbirth and for the mainstream media for having the gumption to carry it suggests that maybe we’re maturing culturally about breasts. As one reader gushed, “Wonderful to see a breastfeeding mother in People!”
It’s true, breasts can be eye candy and baby food. They can fill out a Victoria’s Secret push-up and inspire other nursing mothers. Yay, multitasking! Our bodies — even the sexy parts — aren’t designed for just one purpose all the time, and the idea that breast-feeding was something to be hidden away from the eyes of the world was always a lot of hooey anyway. And if Miranda Kerr can proudly demonstrate that so beautifully, with such enthusiastic support, maybe there’s hope someday for even Bill Ma

American Chefs Boost Fine Dining In France
Topics: From the Wires, News
PARIS (AP) — Paris, once regarded as the gastronomical center of the world, is looking to a cadre of young chefs from a country derided for its love of processed cheese — gasp, the United States — to help raise the bar.
French chefs have been opening fine restaurants stateside for years, but up until about a decade ago, the opposite would have been almost unthinkable. Now, bright young things from New York, Chicago and Seattle are behind some of the City of Light’s most-hyped, hardest-to-get-into establishments.
Chefs such as Spring’s Daniel Rose, or Braden Perkins and Laura Adrian, the pair behind the Hidden Kitchen and the new Verjus, are bringing a fresh energy to Paris’ somewhat rigid fine dining scene and infusing it with American eclecticism.
“Food in France has taken a lot of hits over the years … and they were pretty slow to acknowledge that it was going downhill,” said pastry chef-turned-writer David Lebovitz, one of a handful of American food bloggers who cover the Paris food scene.
“I think we’re now on the cusp of a real renaissance here” — thanks in part, he said, to this nouvelle crop of American-born or trained restaurateurs.
It used to be that French-American culinary exchanges followed the model established by Julia Child in the era when: Americans came to France to study and then went home to impart their wisdom, or simply to cook. Child attended Paris’ renowned Cordon Bleu culinary school in the 1940s, then returned to the U.S. to educate her compatriots on the art of French cuisine.
The new generation of American chefs here has dispensed with the going home part.
Rose, the 30-something behind Spring — Paris’ hardest-to-come-by table, according to Le Figaro newspaper — moved here as a 19-year-old college student primarily, he says, out of laziness.
“I wanted to finish university in a place where I thought it would be really easy. And I thought, ‘the American University of Paris — English is my first language, it’s not everyone else’s, I probably have a pretty good chance,’” said Rose. He said he went to cooking school for largely the same reason.
After a series of apprenticeships with top French chefs, he opened the first incarnation of Spring, a 16-seat restaurant where the centerpiece was an open kitchen where Rose held court as he prepared the food — single-handedly at first.
“Everybody in the world loves a French restaurant and my project was to try to discover what was essential about a French restaurant…. And by paring it down to the essence, I was feeding (my clients) French food that they hadn’t seen in a long time,” said Rose in an interview in Spring’s new 28-seat location, near the Louvre Museum. “It was a novelty. I was the American who opened the restaurant that all the French people wanted to open.”
Rose has the reputation of being the French-est of Paris’ American chefs, and the menu at Spring is unapologetically Gallic: There’s no Franco-American fusion, none of the catering to special dietary needs that’s become almost de rigueur in the U.S. — just a constantly changing medley of French classics made from top-notch, in-season products.
Taking the opposite tack is Marc Grossman, a New York filmmaker-turned-restaurateur who has set about Americanizing the way the French eat. In the land of the cote de boeuf, foie gras and escargot, Grossman founded two vegetarian eateries, Bob’s Juice Bar and Bob’s Kitchen.
“I think people are always looking for something different and in carnivorous Paris I guess you could say we’re exotic,” said Grossman, whose ever-changing menu of smoothies, meat-free burgers, and grain-packed muffins were the stuff of a minor culinary revolution when he first opened, in 2006. “From the beginning, the response has been enthusiastic, and our customers have been unusually regular.”
Seattle natives Perkins and Adrian represent the middle path between Rose’s unyielding Frenchness and Grossman’s healthy California-style offerings.
At their new postage stamp-sized wine bar and just-opened upstairs restaurant, Verjus, the pair serves up amuse-bouches that chart an ideal course between French sophistication and American heartiness. The wine bar menu includes buttermilk fried chicken, roasted clams, and s’mores made with high-end French chocolate.
Perkins and Adrian shot to culinary fame here in 2007, when they opened the Hidden Kitchen, the now-closed supper club the pair held twice a week in their central Paris pad. Though underground restaurants are not unheard-of elsewhere, the Hidden Kitchen was a novelty here, and even the French press lavished them with praise: Le Figaro’s review called it “quite chic and clearly successful — it’s fully booked for months.”
The Anglo-Saxon influence is often palpable at top restaurants here, even when the chefs themselves are not Americans. Gregory Marchand, the Frenchman behind the aptly named Frenchie restaurant, cut his teeth in New York and London, where he worked for telegenic chef Jamie Oliver, before returning to France. Known for its market cooking, Frenchie competes with Spring for the top spot among Paris’ contemporary tables.
Kansas-born, Paris-based food blogger Meg Zimbeck said she sees French chefs’ newfound appreciation for America as part of a generational shift.
“There’s a fear among the older generation that they’re not getting as much credit as they are due,” said Zimbeck, the founding editor of Paris by Mouth, a restaurant review website.
“The younger French chefs, they couldn’t care less about that. They’re traveling, they’re bringing back new ingredients. They have shorter attention spans and they’re not afraid of change,” even if that change hails from the country long mocked as the birthplace of Velveeta and other processed cheese products.
Still, writer Lebovitz warns that Paris remains a challenging destination for young American cooks with big dreams.
“Paris has this huge mystique, it’s like a magnet,” said Lebovitz, “but a lot of times people come here with starry eyes and have absolutely no idea of what they’re in for.”
Lebovitz, a pastry chef by training who spent 12 years at Alice Waters’ iconic Berkeley, Calif., eatery Chez Panisse and moved to Paris seven years ago, says reality can be jarring. Beyond the never-ending bureaucratic torture that is the quest for working papers or, worse still, authorization to open a restaurant, Lebovitz cited the maddening surprises of daily life here.
He described a recent surreal but pedestrian quest for plain white sugar: After searches in several local grocery stores turned up nothing, he resorted to crushing sugar cubes to finish his dessert recipe. “It’s inexplicable, but these kind of things happen all the time in Paris,” Lebovitz added with a resigned smile.
Still, for those who manage to overcome the obstacles, Paris is a huge prize.
“For anyone who likes to cook or eat, this place is simply a dream,” said Lebovitz. “Actually, it’s a dream for pretty much

Drift-Fishing
When the focus switches to halibut, some skippers like to drift-fish to cover more ground. While halibut will aggressively chase prey at times, they more often lie in ambush on the bottom, moving no more than a body length to intercept and inhale a bait. Drifting puts the bait in front of more halibut. At the height of the season, about half of the fish are caught while drift-fishing, says Thompson.
While Cavanaugh often drifts in shallower water — around 24 feet deep — close to the islands, drifting the squid grounds in deeper water usually produces bigger fish. “We will catch fish up to about 25 pounds close to the beach, but we find halibut twice that size out deeper,” he says.
Fighting a Flatty
Most California halibut are hooked over featureless bottom, and the fish themselves don’t make long runs, though they are known to uncork short bursts of speed during a fight.
More characteristically, they may suck themselves into the sand after inhaling the bait or use the current against their broad flanks to resist capture. They can also swim backward and may shake their gaping, toothy maw violently.
Fighting a flatty is a balancing act between maintaining even pressure and not crowding the fish too much, says Cavanaugh. Use a relatively light drag to let the halibut make a run if it wants to. Don’t pump. It will make the fish want to shake its head, and with so many sharp teeth, it can saw through the line.
If you do it right, the fish won’t even realize it is near the surface and may even come up vertically and virtually motionless. Don’t lift the fish above the surface, or it may panic and start to thrash about. This is why a loose drag is critical. As the fish nears the surface, have crew standing by with a gaff to take the fish. Once it’s aboard, laying it white side up will help keep it from getting too wild.
Southern California anglers have their fingers crossed for another record-setting season on halibut in the waters off the Channel Islands. Focus on the squid grounds, and you might be successful on even bigger ’buts this year.
TRIP PLANNER
What: Big California halibut.
When: May through July.
Where: Squid spawning grounds off Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands (outside the marine protected areas).
Who: Boating anglers with reliable craft from 23 feet up, as well as passenger-boat anglers. Here are three top passenger-boat captains who fish the Channel Islands.

Cavanaugh and Thompson prefer different setups. Thompson likes an 8-foot Calstar 196-8 rod with light monofilament line, 15- to 20-pound-test. Cavanaugh, on the other hand, recommends a 9- to 10-foot rod with 50-pound braided line. A small lever-drag reel such as the Avet SX works well, says Thompson.
Both agree that the bite from a halibut is subtle, and that’s Cavanaugh’s rationale for using braided line. “You can feel the fish slurp down a squid even at the end of a long cast,” he explains. Thompson says experience has taught him to recognize the slight bump of a halibut bite even when he’s fishing with monofilament.
Rods: 8- to 10-foot medium-action rods.
Reels: Lever-drag reels, such as the Avet SX or Okuma Cedros 10S.
Lines: 50-pound-test coated braid or 15- to 20-pound-test monofilament.
Baits and Rigs: Live or fresh-dead opalescent squid, fished one or two at a time on a hook.
Terminal Rigs: Lead-heads, 11⁄2 to 21⁄2 ounces, and dropper loops with 6/0 to 8/0 Owner Aki Twist hooks and 5- to 10-ounce torpedo sinkers.

I posted two pretty cool charts yesterday. The first, “Projected Federal Spending on Health Care,” was created for me at healthinsurance.org by Barb Etzkorn. The projections come from the Congressional Budget Office’s extended alternative fiscal scenario.
This graph is important because it distinguishes programs too-often lumped together in the politics of federal budget policy. Medicare is on a truly scary fiscal trajectory, which tends to make the financing of other government health programs look scarier than they are.
Because of health reform, the federal government will support coverage for millions of new people this decade through Medicaid, CHIP, and the new health insurance exchanges. This will cause a noticeable bump between now and 2023. In the long-run, though, predicted spending on these programs will grow more slowly than spending on Medicare or spending on the privately insured.
Spending on these efforts is predicted to grow from about 3% of GDP in 2023 to about 4.5 percent in 2050. That’s an issue, but a much more manageable one than we face in Medicare. To the extent Medicaid really does have cost issues, these reside among the aged and the disabled, not among the millions of other low-income Americans likely to be the principal losers in Republican “repeal and replace” efforts. More here.
The second chart is by Yale economist Ebonya Washington. It shows voting scores of House members on an index developed by the National Organization of Women (NOW). Controlling for many confounding factors, members with a high proportion of daughters were markedly more likely to support access to contraceptive and abortion services than were similarly-situated peers with the same number of children but who happened to have a greater proportion of sons..
Apparently, there’s something about having a child who carries a uterus with her everywhere that concentrates legislators’ minds. Maybe some fathers ponder the possibility that a precious daughter might someday be left alone to bear crushing consequences, or simple humiliation, resulting from an unintended pregnancy.
Harold
Interesting stuff. Any idea why proportions and not presence/absence of daughters, which seems more intuitively reasonable as a measure?
Any spending projections beyond the next ten years or so is pure SWAG.
I find the first chart confusing. What is the meaning of the shaded area? If the lines are Medicare and Medicaid &c separately, the sum is something different.
Why don’t we focus our attention on what’s causing the problem and do something about that, instead of worrying about how we’re going to deal with it, as though it’s something inevitable? Health care costs, all health care costs, are off the charts in an incomprehensible and ridiculous sort of way, don’t you think? When I was a kid and got a sore throat, my mother took me to the doctor and paid a reasonable sum on the way out, antibiotics in hand. Now she’d have to shell out $150 for the 10 minute look-see and another $30 or $40 for the medicine, which, while absolutely typical, is a jaw-dropper as far as I’m concerned. Why is that? Why does it cost $150 to see the doctor for 10 minutes? Why does staying overnight in the hospital with, say, a broken leg result in a bill for $3,500? Why must every single medical service cost a truckload of money?
Medicare problems are not, for the most part, the result of a bulge in the population. They’re the result of incomprehensibly high costs. I wish someone would address that that issue for a change.

Apple, then you pretty much already know all the phone has to offer. The rumors were spot on: 4G LTE, bigger battery, A6 system-on-chip, and new â€œLightingâ€ dock connector are all there. The question now is: How does the iPhone 5 stack up against its biggest rival, Samsungâ€™s Galaxy S3? Check out our spec showdown below for the complete breakdown.
What it means: The Galaxy S3 is the iPhone 5â€²s biggest competitor and judging from its specs, Apple still might have reason to worry. Like many Android phones, the S3 has a screen bordering on 5 inches. To put that into perspective, Samsungâ€™s screen is about the size of the entire iPhone 4S. It is also an entirely different kind of screen. The S3â€²â€™s front-facing camera is nicer, but only marginally and both devices perform roughly evenly when it comes to battery life (weâ€™re guessing). The S3 has an advantage when it comes to processing power and storage due to its 2GB of RAM and microSD slot, but weâ€™d also wager that Appleâ€™s new rear-facing camera will outperform Samsungâ€™s to a noticeable degree, though both employ 8-megapixel technology. Which is the better bang for your buck? We encourage you to try both phones out, as they are both available on most wireless carriers.

My wife and I first went to Farmhouse Cafe in August and it quickly became my favorite restaurant. I had the bouillabaise which was the best I've ever had -- balanced flavors, not too salty. The lemon olive oil cake was a nice ending to the meal.
I'd been looking for an excuse to go there for breakfast and I finally got the chance to go today. They apparently don't have breakfast specials very often, but today, they had a "lamb hash" on the menu. The lamb was a patty seasoned with cumin and cinnamon and other spices, topped with a reduced tomato puree and over easy eggs. It was the most inspired breakfast I've had in ages. After having lamb hash, eating corned beef or roast beef hash will pale in significance in the future -- it was that good! We also ordered the french toast topped with lavender honey. It was light and airy. I wish I could comment on the side order of bacon, but it was gobbled up before I even had a chance to taste it. I can't wait to try the other breakfast dishes in the future. Farmhouse Cafe is a cozy place serving delicious twists on familiar dishes.

Burch better but not quite good enough yet
David Dodd 1:48 a.m., May 18
Kris Markovich - legendary skater, artist, and co-owner of the Oceanside-based Given Skateboards – will be holding a “Perfectly Imperfect” art show at Artlab (3536 Adams Ave. – Normal Heights) on Saturday, September 8.
From Artlab’s website:
“Kris has lots to say when it comes to style and grace. He has definitely left his footprint in the world while devoting his entire life to self-expression. Besides his own works, Kris has recently devoted a lot of his time and talents to the ‘Project C.A.N.V.A.S.,’ a shoe company who's principal says ‘that.”
Artlab and the adjacent Visual Art Supply coordinate their exhibits to be held on the same day in order to create a community vibe while inviting artists to sell their work on the sidewalk, free of charge.
Visual Art Supply will be hosting an exhibit from local Lurkville USA Skateboards and a Ramones cover band, Hey Ho Let’s Go, will be playing from 6 to 7 in the lot.

SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL LGBT FILM FESTIVAL gala opening – Even scalper catches Director’s eye14 June 2007
Shot on location April 30 2007
FRAMELINE KICKS-OFF FILM FESTIVAL TONIGHT
Opening Night Gala Screening of Les Témoins (The Witnesses), Castro Theatre, Thursday, June 14 2007, 7:00 p.m. Tickets.
Paris, 1984. In a cruisey city park, Adrien, a sophisticated, middle-aged doctor, meets Manu, a buoyant 18-year-old. Manu turns down Adrien’s proposition — then asks him to hold his jacket while he joins an orgy in the bushes. Not the best way to start a relationship, yet Adrien takes Manu under his wing. Manu needs guidance, and Adrien comes alive as he tromps around Paris with this energetic newcomer. Adrien’s friend Sarah worries that he’s being taken advantage of, but Adrien disagrees: “You can ask anything of your friends.” The possibilities of friendship are at the heart of this elegant new film from André Téchiné, whose 1994 Wild Reeds is already a classic. Once again, the French auteur demonstrates the complexity of desire — plus his knack for casting sexy, intense young French actors. In lesser hands, the May/December dynamic would slip into heartbreak and stop there, but Téchiné raises the stakes as The Witnesses becomes a story of relationships tested by the onslaught of AIDS. Like a cinematic string quartet, the film intertwines four fascinating lives. Carefree Manu turns dangerous under pressure. Adrien, a doormat in love, becomes a medical warrior fighting the deadly new virus. Sarah struggles to balance motherhood with artistry, while her macho Algerian husband falls into his first gay affair. The Witnesses takes us through a tumultuous year asking us to bear witness to the lives it portrays. — K.M. SOEHNLEIN
Itty Bitty Titty Tickets., Jamie Babbit’s (But I’m a Cheerleader, Frameline24) latest film is as fun as a romantic comedy can get. Featuring Melonie Diaz (Raising Victor Vargas), Nicole Vicius (Half Nelson) and Daniela Sea (“The L Word”), Itty Bitty Titty Committee captures all the excitement of a Le Tigre, Gossip or Bikini Kill show with its adrenaline-fueled feminism, shirtless bravado and enough queer sex to give you one of the best dykey date movies ever. So sit back, enjoy, and then change the fucking world! — CINDY M. EMCH

A survey of local governments in San Luis Obispo County by the Sierra Club shows a wide variation in permit fees charged to businesses to install solar power.
Volunteers with the club surveyed all seven municipalities as well as the county to determine how much the fees would be to install 131 kilowatts of photovoltaic panels on the roof of a business. They determined that the fee would range from $273 in Atascadero to $31,548 in Morro Bay.
The survey is part of a statewide effort by the Sierra Club to encourage local governments to charge only enough in fees to cover costs and thereby encourage more small-scale commercial solar installations, said Kurt Newick, coordinator of the clubs permit-fee campaign.
This installation used in the survey would typically fit on the roof of a 10,000-square-foot building, such as a small grocery store. The cost of such an installation would be about $700,000, and reasonable permit fees would be no more than $2,500, Newick said.
Morro Bay, Pismo Beach and Grover Beach all had fees well above that amount. The club asked those cities to lower their fees. Only Morro Bay responded, Newick said.
Morro Bay building inspector Brian Cowen said only three buildings in the city, all of them supermarkets, have enough roof area to accommodate a system of that scale. The Morro Bay City Council, including three new members, is reviewing its fees.
The city does issue permits regularly for rooftop solar PV (photovoltaic) systems on residences, Cowen told the Sierra Club. The permit and plan check fees are typically on the order of $200 to $500, depending on the scale/stated value of the system.
Big differences

Cayucos is in a class by itself. It thrives in a condition of understated cool by keeping a healthy respect for its ranching roots while hanging onto its beach scene, qualities that similarly defined Avila Beach before the town was rebuilt in faux funk with oil-spill dollars.
And where else but Cayucos can you find a place that a couple of movies dealing with a monster have been made? I make reference to the 1959 camp-classic “The Monster of Piedras Blancas” and its offspring “The Redemption of the Monster of Piedras Blancas,” which was shot early last summer and is in the San Luis Obispo International Film Festival’s lineup this Sunday at the Downtown Cinemas.
Both films were shot — by today’s movie-making standards — at ridiculously low budgets. The 1959 movie was produced for $50,000; its sequel, “Redemption,” was created for the princely sum of $3,000.
OK, the most recent version — which loosely pays homage to the plot of 1939’s “The Wizard of Oz” — was done on a shoestring budget as a “community project,” according to its director, Kerrigan Mahan, and used just a few film industry professionals while relying mostly on local talent. And, it should be noted that most of that $3,000 in production costs went to feeding the 50-plus individuals who labored as long as 14 hours a day to produce the roughly half-hour movie within 30 days.
That tempo demanded sunrise to late-night shoots, some of those taking multiple shots for a scene that may have taken two to four hours to capture. Mahan can’t say enough good things about the actors and behind-the-scene folks who carried out the grueling schedule.
So, what can you expect to see at this Sunday’s 4 p.m. screening? In a nutshell, lots of Cayucos as the film’s main character, Bella (played by Tess Endersby, the then-12-year-old daughter of Morro Bay Harbor director Eric Endersby), goes searching around town for surf mate Cass (played by Casimir Pulaski) who can’t be found. So Bella goes surfing by herself, which leads to the monster and the movie’s message of “love, acceptance, family and all things green.”
(It should be noted right about now that I have a favorable bias with this film. The Lovely Sharita and I lived in Cayucos for a couple of years in the mid-70s, and became friends with Casimir at that time.)
All positive prejudices aside, the film is remarkable for its professional veneer. OK, so the Cave Room at the Madonna Inn was used as the monster’s lair — complete with a rap number — and the monster’s get-up looks a little rubbery; those are nits. By and large, the number of scenes that required set-ups from different angles, and the work done by area residents on a killer schedule is, well, delightful.
A lion’s share of that delight has to be laid at director Mahan’s feet, which have trod the entertainment boards since the 58-year-old was a kid.
Now a Morro Bay resident, Mahan’s father was a film editor, which meant exposure to a Movieola editing machine in his home. From there, he enjoyed a 30-year career in voiceovers in Hollywood, using his various dulcet and menacing tones in hundreds of commercials and films. Perhaps the pinnacle of his calling came when he was the voice of the evil villain Goldar in the “Power Rangers” series and movie.
Google up his name and you’ll find that he’s been “strangled, chased, run over, slugged, stabbed, shot, and set on fire.” Or that he’s voiced a “Mafioso, the hardened cop, the heavy breather, the talking dog.” The guy’s simply a pip behind the camera and in person.
And, if you wonder who the comely miss portraying the mermaid in “Redemption of the Monster of Piedras Blancas” is, look no further than Mahan’s wife Melanie. She’s a twofer for the film festival; she not only opens and closes the monster film, she can also be found in another festival offering, “Playing with Magic.”
It’s slated to run tonight at 7 at the Park Cinema in Paso Robles and at 10 a.m. Saturday at the Palm Theatre in San Luis.
The film deals with Partners in Equestrian Therapy, a county-based outfit that focuses on “the horse-human connection, the emotional and spiritual benefit of playing with horses.”
Redemption of monsters? The healing benefits of horseplay? They’re in a class by themselves; check ’em out.

Recently in the Gulf, there was an explosion. A British Petroleum offshore drilling rig blew up. It has caused several deaths and they have not been able to contain the oil coming up from below the sea. This looks to be a terrible mess for many people.
Several things are hampered by the oil spilling into the Gulf. For an area that depends on fishing as a livelihood, this is not good. The Gulf coast is also a recreation area that attracts many tourists. Perhaps this year they will find a different place to vacation. This has far reaching effects that we may never think of.
Consider the fisherman who cannot fish. His house payments, utilities, etc. still go on. If he doesn’t fish, he doesn’t make money. He could lose most, if not all, that he has. The same is true for those working in the hotel and restaurant industries. This will hurt many people in the future.
Sometimes things happen that are beyond our control. There are times that we err and cause things to happen. But when it is beyond our control, what do we do? We could worry but, Jesus says that won’t add a single cubit to your life-span (Matt. 6:27). We could blame others. There are many times we do that, even when it may be our own fault.
And then we could learn from the Apostle Paul. He stated, "Not that I speak from want; for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am" (Phil. 4:11 NASV). How many times do we wish for things to be better? How many times do we remember the past and yearn for it? How many times have we learned this great lesson of contentment? In the next verse, Paul said he learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.
Thanks, Paul, I need to learn this great lesson. Even when bad things happen, we all can learn to be content. Paul did this by relying on God. He did not force his way into the situation but trusted in One mightier than he. As he did, God gave him what he needed physically and spiritually.
I don’t know all of your circumstances today but, I do know this—if you will surrender to God, He will bring about the best for your life. He will supply your needs (Phil. 4:19). Why not just do the best you can and accept God’s help with the rest? I believe I.

I attended the wedding of my oldest niece. She was born the year I married my wife. While I was there I thought about the passage of scripture in John 2. Jesus and His disciples have gone to a wedding in Cana of Galilee. I’m not sure (the text doesn’t say) if this was a family member, friend or acquaintance. But, He took time for this, and other, social events.
While at the wedding I attended there was a very happy bride (she was gorgeous) and groom. They had many guests and had family and friends present that were special to them. Perhaps it was a special friend that Jesus went to see.
Some of the occasions in our lives are enjoyable while others are heartbreaking. I guess there are divorce "parties" but we usually do not hear much about them. They are not on the society page of the newspaper as are weddings. When a marriage dissolves it is a traumatic event for the couple and especially for their children if they have some.
Each of us who are married should do all we can to make sure our marriages stay strong. Malachi said that God hates divorce (Mal. 2:16). I haven’t read where He changed His mind. Jesus taught against divorce. Our culture sees nothing wrong with changing partners for any and every reason.
In your marriage are you taking time for your spouse? Are you meeting his/her needs? One way to know for sure is to ask them. But if you do be ready to discuss this with them. Will some changes need to be made? No matter how long you’ve been married, you may find there are some things you need to improve on to strengthen the relationship. This must be the ultimate goal—a stronger marriage, not divorce.
But if you discuss with your mate a possible problem be prepared to make the changes if possible. The last thing that should happen is for a divorce to occur and you have the power to prevent that.
Happy marriages make happy.

I won’t lie, I’m super stoked that I have my own tag on your blog! Also, mouth breathers suck,
I will never be able to look at Eli Manning the same again.
This would sound totally callous out of context… but I was so disappointed that Peeta’s leg wound wasn’t more severe and that his leg wasn’t amputated. That was a pretty huge deal, and you’re so right that the whole hovercraft scene at the end would have been so devastating to see on the screen.
HAHAHA That does sound strange out of context! But seriously, Peeta’s wound and amputation were so huge for his character and Katniss’ feelings… I wish we’d been able to see the hovercraft scene.
(And remember how great it was, because as Katniss is flailing, some random Capitol guy walks by and says, “Refreshment?” Man! Wish I could’ve seen that.)
Sarah, you said ALL THE THINGS I was thinking about Movie Peeta. He was so underrepresented in the film. I really liked Josh Hutcherson’s performance, and it was mostly just a matter of the good Peeta moments ending up on the cutting room floor.
One of the first things I said coming out of the theater was how much I missed the hovercraft surgery scene and Katniss’s reaction to finding out he lost his leg. I’m sure the filmmakers had a reason for cutting out these poignant scenes, but for the life of me I can’t imagine why.
” it was mostly just a matter of the good Peeta moments ending up on the cutting room floor.” —Exactly. Strange, though, considering what a big character Peeta is, and the amount of scrutiny G. Ross & Co. had to know their treatment of him would undergo.
“I’m sure the filmmakers had a reason for cutting out these poignant scenes, but for the life of me I can’t imagine why.” I agree, 100%. I hope in the DVD they might address that, or at least in the lead-up to Catching Fire, where they’ll have to discuss how it’s different than the book for Peeta.
Danielle, loved your Gale comments. That first scene of them in the woods, when Gale MESSES UP A KILL for Katniss seemed REALLY out of character, even though he had a point that it was Reaping Day and not a good idea to carry a deer carcass into town. BUT STILL. He and Katniss were so in step in the woods, Katniss tells us so when she tries to hunt with Peeta in the arena, and they definitely deserved one good hunting scene. Also, I expected them to show more of his reactions as a viewer of the games.
It’s true that the best parts from the movie were his interactions with Prim.
And Sarah, I totally agree with your comments about Peeta – he ended up looking stupid at the end of the movie, unaware of the stakes and of the original plan.
Also, it bothered me that they didn’t show Katniss cleaning Peeta and *trying* to address his wound. I think it was a really nice interaction and showed her weaknesses as well as her strengths, and Peeta’s strength too.
That’s so true, having Katniss try to heal gave her a human side, because she was so inept.
And per your first comment, I agree that Gale ruining the hunt was not really part of his character. But the books never showed Gale and Prim interacting, so getting to see that was great.
So a friend on Twitter @melgotserved just introduced me to a hilarious phrase. I referred to Josh as (of course) Peeta Pocket, to which she called Liam “The Towering Inferno.”
I simply had to share it here.
This is a REALLY IMPRESSIVE comparison of the HG boys. I see both sides, but I’m a fangirl. I side with the jawline. #doitforthejawline
THE TOWERING INFERNO! I really hope he gets the chance to live up to that in the next 2 movies. OMG.
And of course you know I am also #doingitforthejawline
LADIES. You’ve given me my solid LOL for the morning. (And I love a good reference to my guest blog! WOOT!) When Hipster Gale is an internet meme, can we credit Danielle for first postulating that he sits in fields and wonders about vests all emo-like?
I have literally written a dissertation on what I think about the Hunger Games, The Movie: Ghost Protocol: The Sands of Time, but it bears repeating. Although I’m disappointed by the backseat that Peeta took to the development of Katniss as a BAMF in the film, there are things that I’m relieved they didn’t do. I’m glad they didn’t give Peeta the Full Lautner treatment. The tween girls would’ve been apoplectic over some shirtless action (OKAY, MAYBE I WOULD’VE BEEN, TOO), but I’m pretty glad they didn’t go there. It maintained his innocence and rightfully didn’t introduce lust into the delicate mix of real vs. imagined feelings of protectiveness and devotion. I’m relieved they didn’t take his leg at the end, although I never really expected them to. (A grave injury to said leg, though, was necessary, and I am disappointed they extricated that.) I’m relieved they gave him a few moments that gave him a spine AND made him funny and popular.
And maybe my favorite moment that they left in the film? As Katniss, Effie, and Peeta are being driven from the Reaping to the train, Katniss is sitting hollow-eyed and staring into nothing, and Peeta’s sitting on the other side of the cab, looking out the window and crying. Just like in the book. So him. So well-acted. So obviously not (and never will be) the alpha in this relationship. I mean, can you imagine seeing a scene like that in any other film?
I would obviously love hipster Gale credit! Also, I’m pretty sure Movie Gale was a fan of The Hunger Games before it got popular.
Your comment just made me hope so badly that they give Movie Gale the TLaut treatment in the next movie! It will totally do a disservice to the book, but it will make this creeper one very happy gal.
“the Hunger Games, The Movie: Ghost Protocol: The Sands of Time” *DIES*
I am so with you re: not wanting the Lautner treatment. I mean, we love Peeta because he provides carbs, not so much with the shirtlessness.
Okay but now I’m curious why you’re relieved they didn’t take his leg? It definitely would’ve made films 2 and 3 more difficult, but it was a HUGE thing to change, right? (honest question, not meant to be read sassy at all!)
ARGH you are SO right about the moment with Peeta crying. He’s unlike most of the other YA fangirl lust objects for that (also see comments re: happy about him keeping his shirt on), god bless him. That would absolutely not happen in another film. GAH! CAN WE WATCH THIS TOGETHER PLS?
I totally missed the hovercraft scene at the end. I WANTED to see Katniss going apeshit for Peeta, yanno? Well, clearly you know because you already said it yourself.
The Hovercraft Scene!! It is honestly one of the most strongly imagined ones from the entire series for me. I remember when I first read it, tears streaming down my face. WHY did it have to go??
Great post! Your take on Movie Gale was spot-on. I can’t wait to see what they do with him in the next couple movies when he should have a bigger part to play. And also – LOL on the mouth breather comment! I didn’t even notice it so much on Gale but that is the EXACT reason that I was disappointed (a little) in the actor who plays Jon Snow on Game of Thrones. Jon Snow should be hot. And a mouth breather is not!!
HAHA Gale and Jon Snow eh? I think there’s a blog post in there somewhere Kitty!
And I’m definitely with you—in the next two movies both Peeta and Gale will have more time to grow into their characters I think. *hopes*
Dude, dude. The mouthbreather-Gale? And his Eli Manning status?!? Am laugh so much.
I will admit that an hour into the movie the first time around, I realized that I was MAD in love with Josh Hutcherson. Not quite ready to chip a nail catfighting Miley Cyrus for him, but, like, whoa. Given the script, he was a-ma-zing. But I was hardcore Team Peeta throughout the books. That boy knows what is up.
Still, robbing him of robbing him of his leg? Not cool. It’s going to be really hard for them to compensate the emotional impact there. I could be really cynical and say it’s a Hollywood plot to sideline disabled-friendly stories, but I suspect it’s more just a victim of time limits. We’ll see how it plays out in 2013.
Sob . . . so far away!
Girl. I am going to be two full years older when Catching Fire comes out. I can’t even.
And you’re right, I definitely think cutting the amputation was a time-limit thing, but wow. What a MAJOR change, you know? And no matter what, the fact that it eliminates a character who was disabled is definitely going to be critiqued—as it should, I think. Awareness, yay!
Ever read a blog post and wish you’d written it? That totally just happened to me! You both just wrote EVERYTHING I wanted to say about the boys in the movie, especially Peeta, but couldn’t put the right words to! I just re-read the book after seeing the movie twice. Reading it again made me love Book Peeta more (!) and more aware of how Movie Peeta fell short. I don’t think it was Josh – it seemed more like it was the material he was given. Peeta had such great lines in the book, and the movie just didn’t do him justice. And, you know, I wanted more kissing. For reals. I still loved the movie, but I wanted to love Peeta more than I did. You identified exactly why that was, and THIS POST (rather than the movie) totally solidified my Peeta love.
Also – Totally agree about mouth breathers. Gross. And lots of LOL-ing at this: “Movie Gale mopes in a field, painting his nails, and ponders whether or not vests have become too mainstream.”
*HUGS HANNAH FOREVER* Thank you so much! I’m so glad you could relate to the post :D
When Danielle sent me that comment (Gale re: vests) I about died. MAN she is funny!
Team Peeta. There’s no changing my mind on that one. I was also really upset that they didn’t put the leg problem at the end. Not only does it get mentioned in the coming books, it also just shows you Katniss’s real feelings for him, even if she doesn’t know what they are herself.
You are SO right Carmen. In the interviews when Peeta reveals his leg was amputated, Katniss’ reaction was completely genuine. It showed so much about her, and her feelings. We really missed that at the end of this movie, IMO.
I completely agree with everything you said. I feel embarassed that I did this, but a couple of times when the camera flashed on Cato (Alexander Ludwig) staring at Katniss,- I totally thought “Aw! Peeta looks so cute!”. I AM A TERRIBLE PERSON. It’s just that Alexander Ludwig and Josh Hutcherson have similar features, though he is quite tall. I fail at life.
Also, Erin’s post was the reason I started following your blog. I loved it!
HAHA I don’t think mistaking Cato for Peeta would be hard to do at all! But Cato has about 12 feet on Josh, LOL. They are both QUITE easy on the eyes :)
Aaaaw I’m so glad you loved Erin’s post! She is a genius, straight-up!
so apparently I am stalking your archives. I haven’t read THG in years, and I forgot all that great stuff about peeta. love the cake comment and am now super bummed it didn’t make it in. though he still won me over in the movie. (lol at mouth-breather gale)
I hadn’t re-read the book for about 2 years until I did for this post. I loved Peeta like, even more after reading it critically. He is such a complicated character. They just didn’t have the time to get to that, I guess :(
I totally forgot to comment on this over the weekend! So I’ll make this short and sweet as I think I have the makings of my own ridic long HG movie review in the works for this week & I always feel bad about leaving walls of text in your comments. LOL.
1. Danielle’s comments on Book Gale vs. Movie Gale are so amazing it hurts. I had to read it OUT LOUD to my friend because it was so funny. And I agree so much, btw. Book Gale is way hotter (and Chris is indeed the superior Hemsworth :P). I liked the idea of actually getting to see Gale observing the Games & the conflict there, but while he got more screen time in the movie, he was much more of a presence in the books. But there’s not really you can do much about that since that presence was thanks to our being in Katniss’ head and her thinking about him.
And omg, mouth-breathing! That was probably the FIRST thing I noticed about Movie Gale in the first HG trailers that came out. I was like OMG, CLOSE YOUR MOUTH.
2. PEETA, OH PEETA. I was soooo iffy about Josh Hutcherson being cast as Peeta (even though I’m Team Gale), but he completely won me over in the movie. He was so Peeta, I can’t even. All that aside, I agree so much with your review about the CHARACTER of Movie Peeta! Movie Peeta made me feel a lot of things similar to what I felt for Book Peeta, but I was definitely missing the complexity! It’s been a while since I read HG, so your detailed post brought back so much, but I do remember being more iffy about Book Peeta – and not in a bad way. It was kind of awesome to see this “nice guy” (or as my friend would say, “tofu”) sort of character who was both charismatic and nice and generally seen as “weaker” than Katniss reveal himself to be clever and savvy and in many ways as much of a fighter as Katniss (though in different ways). I remember being surprised by Book Peeta’s social deftness and even cunning, his sarcastic humor, and especially the fact that I found I didn’t know if I could trust him. It was like I had one impression of him that deepened and changed as I got to know him over the course of the book.
In the movie, all of that was flattened out, and I get where that was coming from. I feel like within the movie constraints he needed to be less ambiguous and more clearly an ally to Katniss or at least more clearly sympathetic, but I miss Book Peeta’s ambiguity. AND you see, I think this flattening out thing also plays into my gripe that they didn’t give us enough on the real/not real theme. Because Peeta’s instances of showing his understanding of showmanship were taken out (i.e. the “one of them might be rich” comment), it also lessened the idea of how important showmanship is to helping you in the Games. Like the whole urgency of acting to save your life was lost for me in the movie, and I think the broader strokes used on Peeta’s character contributed to that.
Also, yeah, what was UP with magically fixing his leg? Again, urgency gone. I was all – wow, Peeta’s running really well/fast away from those Mutts! I don’t recall this at all from the book. Wasn’t he limping along at this point???
OK, I need to stop because I’m writing another essay here. In short, Book Peeta > Movie Peeta but Josh Hutcherson is still the Bread King.
I totally agree 100% with everything you said. Overall I liked the movie, but one of my main complaints was the loss of the complexities and subtleties of the Katniss/Peeta relationship, which is one of my absolute favorite things about the book. And I especially hated the way they made the ending so less intense and traumatic for both of them. It was all just too easy. I touched on all this in my movie recap, but you did an awesome job explaining everything in-depth. Great post! :)
OK if u all remember peetas leg was ok (kind of)until a mutt bit it!!! he only lost his leg from about the knee down
I must agree with you completely. The movie utterly failed to represent the emotions going on and the characters were a bit misplaced. As much as I love Liam, I believe that they should have casted someone with a bit more edge. The worst parts of the movie were when you watch and you notice they skipped something or they jump too fast from scenes. I know you have a time restraint, but the movie script could have been done with a bit more thought and consideration towards the book. All in all, the movie was okay for someone who never read the book, but for a reader, the movie completely ruined the book.
I stopped by today to read your RTW, which was lovely, and end up here. You girls are all spot on! I really loved Book Gale up until the last part of Mockingjay, and I think they missed the opportunity to do more with Movie Gale. The overall complexity of the Katniss-Peeta relationship was lacking even before the ending, but I suppose they had to keep it under 3 hours.
Omg I love you Peeta!
I LOVE GALE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No trying to turn this into twilight but ……. TEAM GALE 4 LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Honestly I’m not a big Gale fan…to me he’s nothing more than Katness without the compassion but I see his place in the books. My problem with it is that in the first book he really didn’t have that big of a role yet in the movie every small bit he had in the book was shown at the expense of scenes that are more important to the overall story…like Rue telling about her district which shows how bad things really are outside of district 12. In fact I could have done with a lot less Gale and more of the stuff they left out about Peeta…afterall book two deals with a little more of Gale and by book three he is actually a main character…I say there is time to do them all justice.
My fear is that in the wake of Twilight they are trying to make this into a Hollywood triangle thing…which just isn’t there in the books. Does Katness have feelings for both guys…sure…but they are not the same kind of feelings and you can pick up on that throughout the books. The guys are even civil towards one another. I just hope we don’t get an attempt at Twilight and miss that the story is more about the society that Katness lives in and what her actions in the Hunger Games unleash on that society.
Oh my… you nailed it! I was disappointed with both representation of Gale and Peeta in the movie. I could never quite understand Katniss’ almost emotionless response to either of the guys – but let’s face it, Gale was a hunk in the book, and movie Gale was almost superfluous and definitely not a fiercely independent mountain guy who was her equal. And Peeta… movie Peeta just wasn’t book Peeta. I didn’t particularly like book Peeta either, but he did at least play the game while grappling with the reality that Katniss didn’t really return the affection.
Love your insights into the film relative to the book – both on the two leading men and the movie itself
Yeah, they cut it all out; all the reasons why we fell for their love story.
I am left hoping that it is a part of the bigger picture. However, fire needs to truly catch in Catching Fire.
Regarding Peeta: he’s such a wonderfully complex and sometimes surreally good and true character, that while reading the books you long for his presence. The movie tried and failed to build this feeling. It achieved dissatisfaction by decreasing his presence and depth. Dissatisfaction, unfortunately, is not the same as longing.
On the brighter side, I almost liked Josh’ performance. He portrayed the character from an unexpected angle that is still very likable. I truly hope that next time they’ll give him a good screenplay to work with, because I feel like he has the talent and guts to make Peeta unforgettable.
its like you read my mind exactly what i thought
Hi. Ok, you have voiced EXACTLY what I thought when I watched the movie, and exactly what I hate about it! Honestly I think it has to do with the casting. But what you said is true – in the book, Gale is rugged, angry in a brooding hot way. (This was my exact argument that went out via mass text the second I finished the movie – yes I tend to get way too into things;p). In the movie, Gale smiles! Easily! That’s not supposed to happen! And don’t even get me started on Peeta. I just thought he was a bumbling idiot in the movie. In the book, he doesn’t have Gale’s outward manliness per se, but he shows his courage and sincerity in an equally appealing way. Again, I think it comes down to the casting. I know that it can’t be exactly what I pictured in my head, but I really wish they would have called me before they hired a meathead and an idiot.
First of all, I really enjoyed your comments and totally agree with them. I think that they did lose some of Peeta’s complexity in the movie, but I have to give Josh Hutcherson some credit. I wasn’t sure when I saw him cast that he would fit (because he just didn’t fit my vision), but he captured the personality and feel of Peeta perfectly. As you said, the interview scene(and the one right after in the window) were exactly as envisioned.
I also agree that while the kiss between K/P did nothing for me, the moment after Katniss brings back the medicine and he puts it on her forehead was hot. I felt the chemistry there. My main complaint about the movie and the K/P relationship was the missing confrontation at the end. Peeta does not find out that Katniss was faking for the cameras the whole time. This is everything for what their relationship is at the beginning of Catching Fire. Since it wasn’t there, I am not sure how this will play in the next movie. I was frustrated because I felt it was a truly important scene for them. Anyways…
I won’t make any judgements on Gale. There was just so little to work with. What I saw I liked, but will keep my opnions until we get to the good stuff later on.
I really appreciate your comments and views. They were spot on!

It was actually raining when we started this engagement shoot with the beautiful Rachel and her equally gorgeous fiance Ben – but we didn’t let that put us off! Armed with wellies and big smiles, we had a great early morning walk around Ditchling Common – a stunning location with lots of wild woods, just perfect for a romantic shoot. The rain cleared up, leaving this beautiful soft misty light which I love for romantic engagement shoots. And even better when your subjects are as stunning as this couple. I love Rachel and Ben – both were unsure about being photographed, but relaxed so much when they realised how easy it was! I’m photographing their wedding at the end of April at the gorgeous Upwaltham Barns! I can’t wait!
Oooh and a particular highlight to this shoot, which deserves a special mention, is our cream tea at the Ditchling Tea Rooms. Seriously, the scone was bigger than my head. It was enormous. And DELICIOUS! You must go and pay them a visit, it was the cutest Tea Room in the world. In fact I’ve decided all my engagement shoots should end with a great big cake. That is my goal!

SARATOGA SPRINGS — Ramon Dominguez, who effectively wrapped up the Saratoga jockey title a couple of weeks ago, turned what had already been a spectacular meet into an historic, record-breaking one on Sunday. By winning six races on Sunday’s card, Dominguez increased his total for the meet to 66, one better than the record of 65 set by John Velazquez in 2004. (Note: Because one of the horses Velazquez rode was later found to have raced with a banned substance, his official win total is 64.)
Dominguez won with six of his seven mounts, including four races in a row (the sixth through the ninth). Three of the six wins came aboard favorites, and two occurred on 4-1 shots. The sixth win, and the one that put him over the top at 66, came when he booted home 10-1 longshot Unbridled Command in the ninth race, the Grade 3 Saranac Stakes.
“It was something I was thinking about once in a while, especially since we were getting closer to the end [of the meet],” Dominguez said of the record. “I thought we could tie the record with Johnny. If we had a chance to break it, that would have been even better. I was surprised to do it all today. I’ll be able to sleep good with a big smile, and prepare for tomorrow with no pressure.”
Dominguez’s winners on Sunday included Cue the Moon (Race 2), Native Wave (Race 4), World Premier (Race 6), Shakeira (Race 7), Temper in Command (Race 8) and Unbridled Command (Race 9).
Race 1
Trying nine furlongs for the first time, six weeks
after losing ground late in a race run at seven, Bellamy Brew at first glance didn’t look like much of bargain at 7-2 in Sunday’s first-race allowance/optional claimer.
Sent immediately to the front by jockey Jose Lezcano, the 4-year-old son of Bellamy Road – who was making only his third career start — was all business right from the start, leading gate to wire in triumphing by two lengths. The running time over a “fast” main track was a respectable 1 minute, 49.55 seconds.
Tritap ran within a length or two of the winner most of the way, and coming off the turn he looked like he might pose a serious challenge. But Bellamy Brew managed to keep the Tapit colt at bay, covering the last three furlongs in 36.36 seconds. Tritap nosed out favored Seniors Pride (2-1) for second.
Bellamy Brew is now 2-for-3 for his career and has earned $86,300. He paid $9.30. Continued...
Race 2
Liquid Lunch took most of the money at 6-5 in this seven-furlong maiden special weight for 2-year-old fillies. The daughter of Street Sense was coming off a runner-up effort at Saratoga at 5 1/2 furlongs on Aug. 1.
Liquid Lunch sat off the early pace of Lucky Friend and Rossweisse before challenging those two coming off the turn. Cornering with a short lead, the favorite shifted over to the rail where he was soon challenged by Emollient, who went by inside the sixteenth pole. Emollient was in turn passed by first-timer Cue the Moon (7-2), who continued on for the half-length win. The running time was a pokey 1:24.30 over a “fast” main track.
Ramon Dominguez, riding his first of six winners on the day, was aboard for Spendthrift Farm and trainer Jim Bond.
Cue the Moon, a daughter of Malibu Moon, brought $310,000 as a yearling at last year’s Keeneland September sale.
Race 4
After failing to escape the maiden ranks in four attempts in maiden special weights, Native Wave was tried in a $65,000 maiden claimer in her most recent outing here on Aug. 3. She was beaten less than two lengths that day, as good a reason as any for the 4-year-old Rahy filly to be sent off as the 2-1 favorite in this $65,000 maiden claimer at 1 1/16 miles.
Relentless Road took care of the early pacesetting duties, opening up a 3 1/2-length lead after a half-mile in 45.93 seconds. The Bellamy Road gelding stayed up into mid-stretch, where he was passed first by Espiritu Libre and then by Native Wave, who out-finished his rival by a neck in 1:41.85.
Ramon Dominguez won his second race of the day, upping his total to 62 for the meet. Anthony Dutrow conditions Native Wave for Michael Dubb.
Race 6 Continued...
World Premier broke a 10-race losing streak when she romped by five lengths in a $20,000 claimer here on July 30. Run back Sunday at the same six-furlong distance and at the same claiming level, the 3-year-old daughter of Gulch was dispatched as the 4-1 second choice in the wagering.
Tanglewood Tale and Harmony Hills did most of the early running, with Tanglewood Tale taking over as the field straightened out for home. The 3-year-old Tale of the Cat filly stayed up into the final sixteenth before giving way to World Premier and longshot She’s Gosphel (32-1). World Premier hit the wire two lengths in front, stopping the timer in 1:11.41.
With the win, World Premier’s record stands at 3-2-3 from 13 starts, with earnings of $84,146. Ramon Dominguez was aboard for The Write Stuff Stable and SBW Birthstone Stables. World Premier paid $10.00 to win and topped a $389.50 exacta with She’s Gosphel.
Race 7
Dominguez looked like he might have left himself with too much to do in this one, as his mount (Shakeira) had six horses to pass and four lengths to make up at the furlong pole. But the red-hot jockey was able to get it done, continuing an outside rally that had commenced in upper stretch and getting up to win by three-quarters of a length. The running time was 1:40.52 for 1 1/16 miles over “firm” going.
Shakeira, a winner of three of her last four, sports a 4-6-2 record from 13 lifetime starts and earnings of $175,122. The 4-year-old Freud filly is conditioned by Chad Brown for Michael Dubb. Shakeira was bred in New York by Joda Farm LLC.
Race 8
Dominguez earned his 65th win with one of his patented patient rides, this one aboard 2-1 favorite Temper in Command. Seemingly walled-in in mid-stretch, Dominguez waited until room appeared to his outside, then angled his mount around horses to daylight. The 3-year-old Master Command filly struck the front nearing the sixteenth pole, continuing on to win the first-level allowance for statebreds by a length. The running time was 1:41.71 for 1 1/16 miles.
Temper in Command was victorious in her second try against winners. Dale Romans conditions the chestnut filly for Mark H. Stanley. Temper in Command was bred in New York by Thomas-Narlinger LLC and Milan Kosanovich.

Thanks for all the comments about my Grandmother. She has been moved into a rehabilitation facility for a few weeks to receive physical therapy and to help her shoulder heal. She is one tough cookie and isn't going to let a mere shoulder break get her down.
Evelyn and I flew back to Texas Monday morning, after almost missing our flight due to incredibly heavy traffic created by an accident. Although getting through security was a breeze with just one child (I won't mention how a considerate TSA worker became severely frustrated when I told him I could not lift our heavy stroller onto the conveyor belt while holding a wiggly 11 month old....fortunately Kind Business Man stepped in and helped.), the flight was not our best. Evelyn has a need to GO and sitting in a car seat (after enduring one for almost two hours in traffic) or in my lap is not her idea of fun. However, she did greatly love standing in my lap and waving at any and every passenger who would look her way. Special thanks goes out to the man sitting in front of me who felt the need to recline his seat, despite the fact that there is zero leg room anyway and I was holding a fussy baby. Thanks, dude. Hope you enjoyed your paper from your reclined position. I enjoyed letting my child repeatedly put the tray table up and down during the flight, since it happened to be in my face anyway.
Moving on....
Monday afternoon Tobe and I headed out to Houston for the Bruce Springsteen concert (I had to give my ticket up for the show in Dallas Sunday night because of the impromptu trip to Arkansas). Only one word describes the show: EXCELLENT! We were questioned by a fellow concert-goer as to our age (we look younger than we are...especially with no kids in tow...and most people in the crowd were middle-aged) and then given great accolades for our taste in music. It was a great, quick trip. One of the highlights was witnessing the end of a drug bust at our hotel when we check-in. Nice. However, my sense of reasoning decided that since a drug bust had already occurred, we were quite safe. I am nothing if not practical.
Today is all about getting back into our groove and cleaning the hovel that is our house. Wish us luck.
While E. and I were away, Tobe and Isaac fit more into two days than I get accomplished with the children all week. They enjoyed each other's company so much, I do not think they realized the girls were gone.
Here are a few pictures of Isaac at our local farm enjoying a spring festival:

Glad you made it home and your Grandmother is going to be okay. We are taking our first flight with Ethan in June. How we managed to avoid it for this long is a mystery, but I always enjoy your post-flight commentary. And good luck with the hovel cleaning. You make me laugh.
You are inspiring me. I'll be flying by myself with Tate for the first time in another month. Good timing to be right in the middle of the must-be-moving-all-of-the-time phase. I'm already stressing! :)
Glad all's well at casa de phillips! Did you hear about ACU's policy change regarding alcohol?
Glad you made it home safely. Good luck getting back into the routine of things!!

Chicken Cordon Peru
Ingredients:
For marinade:
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1 x juice of lime
- 1 1/2 Tbsp. Peruvian Chile Lime Seasoning
For chicken:
- 4 x 6 oz. boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
- 1 Tbsp. olive oil
- 6 oz. ground Chorizo sausage*
- 1/4 cup carrots, diced
- 1/4 cup Poblano chile peppers, diced
- 1/4 cup red onion, diced
- 2 Tbsp. dehydrated minced garlic
- 2 Tbsp. pimento olives, sliced
-
Notes:
*See our Chimayo Chorizo Spice to make your own sausage.
Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a bowl combine ingredients for marinade and set aside. Using a sharp knife, slice each chicken breast half in two horizontally to produce 8 thin cutlets. Place each cutlet between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, and pound each to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet. Place the cutlets and the marinade into food storage bag, seal and shake to evenly disperse the marinade. Refrigerate for 30 min.
Heat the olive oil over a medium-high heat in a sauce pan. Add chorizo and brown until the sausage releases its juices, about 3 to 4 min., stirring occasionally. Using a slotted spoon, remove chorizo and set aside. In the same pan, with the juices from the sausage, saute the polbano chiles and carrots for 2 to 3 min. Stir in garlic and onion and saute until the onions are translucent, 3 to 4 min. Remove from heat and set aside.
Combine bread crumbs, Peruvian Chile Lime Seasoning and grated parmesan in a medium shallow bowl and set aside. In a separate medium bowl, blend melted butter into the chicken stock. and then dredge in the bread crumb mixture. Place rolls, seam side down, in a 9 x 13 casserole dish. Pour remaining stock mixture over chicken. Bake for 35 to 40 min. until cooked through and the tops are golden.
Serving Suggestions:
Serve with rice and topped with our Poblano Chile Sauce.

Eight of Vancouver’s community centres boast ice rinks. The prices vary by centre and membership may be required, but all have group lessons for those aged three and up, and some offer private lessons for preschoolers. For many current lessons, registration is still open, and spring registration starts at the beginning of March.
For a day-trip, Grouse Mountain’s outdoor rink is a great wintery choice, but since the gondola ride is about $40 for an adult (children under four are free), plan to take in a few different activities (perhaps a sleigh ride and Theatre in the Sky) while there.
So, what’s your wait? This winter, enjoy a family skate.

Rural Manufacturer Uses SBA Programs to Preserve Jobs
Patriot Industries, Inc. is located in the cities of Monticello and Albany, two very rural communities in southern Kentucky. Monticello is located in Wayne County. Albany is located in Clinton County, which was recognized as an Empowerment Zone in 1996. Empowerment zones are designated to stimulate growth and economic development in poor, rural, underdeveloped communities across the country.
Patriot Industries offers four primary services: cutting and sewing, screen printing, manufacturing and warehousing. The company has used several SBA programs to help establish and grow the company. Jack Mills, President & CEO of Patriot Industries, realized that with the trend to ship operations offshore in the cut and sew industry, he would have to use all of the advantages of small business programs offered by SBA in order to retain and increase American jobs at American factories such as Patriot Industries.
The company was 8(a) certified in December 2000 and received its Small Disadvantaged Business certification at the same time. Patriot Industries received HUBZone certification in August 2001. Using these resources, the firm has won multiple contracts in 8(a), SBD, HUBZone and subcontracting opportunities. The company has grown from under 100 employees in 2000 to approximately 350 employees today.
Patriot Industries’ main manufacturing expertise is in the cutting and sewing of military products. Their labor force is experienced in sewing all weights and types of materials. Additionally, their screen printing capabilities use modern, high capacity equipment.
Patriot Industries is currently the major subcontractor for a government prime contractor. Patriot employees manufacture components for the Modular Lightweight Load Carrying Equipment system and the company has manufactured over five million components. Patriot is currently gearing up to manufacture the Improved Outer Tactical Vest.
Patriot also manufactures fire retardant clothing as a subcontractor. Additionally, they have manufactured, as the prime contractor, a fire retardant coverall for the Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Center in Philadelphia, PA, and athletic shorts and jerseys for the U.S. Air Force Academy.
The company’s success is derived from its strong leadership and dedicated team at Patriot Industries. In fact, the firm’s business philosophy is summed in into three key statements.
- Quality - Engineered and manufactured into the products
- On Time - Our team members know that late shipments mean unhappy customers.
- Value - We realize that cost effective manufacturing is essential to obtaining and keeping customers.
Additionally, Patriot is ISO 9001:2008 certified. In 2011, Patriot Industries was recognized as an SBA 100 company. The SBA 100 program features 100 businesses that have created at least 100 jobs since receiving SBA assistance.

Arthur Raymond Uribe, 24, turned himself in to the San Bernardino Police station Monday morning, Lt. Rod Topping said.
On Jan. 4, Uribe allegedly barged into a mobile home in the 700 block of East Base Line and shot his former girlfriend and her new boyfriend, according to police officials.
The couple was taken to an undisclosed hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Their current conditions were unknown but they were expected to survive. Authorities also didn't comment if they had been released from the hospital.
It was unclear what led up to the shooting.
Court records show Uribe was previously arrested and convicted of felony vandalism in 2006, but outside of that has no serious criminal record.
He is scheduled to be back in court on Jan. 18.
Anyone with information that may aid the San Bernardino Police Department can contact Detective Brian Lewis at 909-384-5762, or Sgt. Gary Robertson at (909) 841-5361.

Prom season is once again upon us, which means it’s time to find this year’s perfect prom dress. Scala USA should be your first and last stop, as our selection of beautiful prom dresses features some of the year’s hottest fashions, including prom dresses inspired by the newest trends in evening dresses. If you’re looking for a prom dress that is as memorable as the prom itself, you’ll find it on our site.
Prom dresses have always varied greatly in fit and design. Some girls prefer long, ankle-length gowns with a flowing fit, while others may be looking for a shorter, form-fitting skirt. Whether you’re looking for the simple elegance of solid silver or prefer a bold print in bright colors, our 2011 line of prom dresses will have something that suits you perfectly.
Prom dress designs are often inspired by the transition from spring to summer. Bright, cheerful colors are a popular choice, as are fun, flirty cuts. However, classical elegance is also a perennial favorite, with floor-length gowns in sumptuous fabrics being a great choice for many girls. No matter which you choose, a dress from Scala USA is designed to be beautiful and high quality, ensuring a prom dress that lives up to the importance of one of the most memorable events in a girl’s life.
While many think of Prom as a North American tradition, many other countries have similar formal dances for students. In the UK, many students look forward to the Leavers’ Ball or School Formal, while in Ireland it may be referred to as the Debutante’s Ball. No matter where the dance is held, though, the focus on formal attire for both boys and girls is a common element.
Of course, prom isn’t the only important dance of the year. Each fall, schools around the country celebrate homecoming, a tradition that gives students both past and present a chance to honor their school. The homecoming dance is the first major dance of the year, and our selection of fall-inspired homecoming dresses are sure to be a hit.
Scala USA has a 26 year history of providing beautiful evening wear for all occasions. Our reputation comes from our fabulous selection of colors, designs, fabrication and fits in prom dresses, evening dresses, cocktail dresses and more.

We also sell beaded jackets, tops and accessories to complement our dresses.
Whether you’re looking for 2011 prom dresses or the perfect gown for your next big event, choose Scala USA. You’ll be dazzled by the beauty of our dresses and you’ll quickly discover why we have been such a popular choice since 1985.

10 Ways to Make the Switch From Summer to School
Learning Benefits
1.:
- Making three new friends or sitting at a different lunch table every week
- Becoming captain of the chess team or a spelling bee finalist
- Making the honor roll
5. Keep Passions in Play. If your child became a weaving whiz at summer camp or a diving champ at the local pool, keep it going. Integrate new summer hobbies into the school year by finding after-school clubs or groups that will let her continue to do the cool new things she tried this summer!
6. Summon the Learning Spirit. Assign creative "homework" as summer wanes: Ask him to identify a paw print in the park or photograph something that changes colors. Make family flashcards and quiz each other: What was the farthest you went from home this summer? What plans were rained out?
7. Take a Family Field Trip. Plan one last fact-packed trip to top off months of water parks and baseball games. You don't have to go far: Visit a nature sanctuary to learn about different plants and trees, or examine an old ship down at the docks.
8. Set Up a Homework Area. Create a quiet, well-lit space for study. Prevent first day freak-outs by hauling out the necessities: backpack, dictionary, atlas, calculator, art supplies, paper, and pencils. Make it personal and fun, but free from distractions.
9. Sharpen Skills. Add more factual brain-bending activities into the everyday mix. Sudoku games, crossword puzzles, word searches, and trivia all encourage your child to sit still, focus, and complete a task from start to finish.
10. Go for a Test Run. Take a trip to school, and get familiar with the new classroom. Make sure to find the cafeteria, gym, theater, and library. Don't forget about bathrooms! It's also a good time to size up cubbies, try out lockers, and locate a pay phone.

Speaker Profile: John Sullivan
Book This Speaker!
John Sullivan
Adventurer and Explorer - John Sullivan
John Sullivan's 'Survival Story Presentation' motivates and inspires students, offering an insight into new cultures, exotic countries and exciting adventure. John Sullivan joined the Royal Marines at the age of 16, travelling across the world in pursuit of adventure. After leaving the forces he started a company specializing in extreme survival training, working in some of the most inaccessible corners of the globe.
John has been an expedition leader for several conservation projects leading gap year students in the jungles of Belize and Borneo and. Lasting a minimum of one hour, these interactive and engaging presentations consist of a unique rollercoaster of images, sounds and amazing tales that encourage students to follow their own dreams and achieve their potential.
Testimonial
"The presentation was truly inspiring; our students really enjoyed listening to John's experiences in the Royal Marines and his role working for TV companies in the jungle that they realised they could be just like him. By working hard, broadening their horizons, learning new skills and believing in themselves they too could achieve anything they put their heart into. An inspiring day that left an enduring impression - fantastic." Adrian Barber, Project Manager, Bigger Picture Arts
"Thank you so very much for coming to talk to our sixth formers yesterday evening. Having read the testimonials on the School Speakers website and having done a wee bit of research about you online I was pretty sure that you were going to be an excellent speaker and you certainly lived up to our expectations! The students were absolutely buzzing by the time that you left, they absolutely loved your talk. The mix of slides and video clips really enhanced the talk and brought your experiences to life and what really struck me was looking around at the students' faces and seeing the admiration in their eyes and that look of 'I could actually do something like that'. I was particularly impressed at how you aimed the talk at exactly the right level for them too, because when you meet someone like you who is so accomplished and has done so much it is very easy to feel a bit inadequate and yet you come across as being just an ordinary bloke, although clearly you are not! The centre is buzzing this morning with anecdotes and tales of your adventures.
I hope that we can invite you back again in the near future to hear more about your adventures, it was a really excellent evening." Laura Schofield, Head of Sixth form, Queens College Taunton Somerset

In the spring of 2001, a lecture/video series, entitled “Speak Truth to Power”, was instituted at Schreiner University as an extracurricular event in the evenings that stimulated discussion and dialogue between members of the University and the community. It is believed that the best way to stimulate this discussion is to offer “different voices” or controversial speakers/programs – at least speakers and programs outside the mainstream media, but who still “spoke the truth” (taken from a Quaker document).

MARZOCHI, Keyla BF et al. Phase 1 Study of an Inactivated Vaccine against American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in Normal Volunteers in Brazil. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz [online]. 1998, vol.93, n.2, pp. 205-212. ISSN 0074-0276..
A Phase 1 double-blind placebo-controlled study was performed to evaluate a vaccine against American tegumentary leishmaniasis in 61 healthy male volunteers. Side effects and the immune response to the vaccine were evaluated, with 1- and 2- dose schemes, with intervals of 7 or 21 days, each dose containing 1440 mg of protein N antigen of a single strain of Leishmania amazonensis (PH 8) diluted in merthiolated saline (1:10,000). Merthiolated saline and an inert substance were used as placebos. No significant clinical alterations were found following the respective injections in the vaccinated individuals as compared to the placebos, except for local pain, which was associated significantly with injection of the vaccine. The laboratory alterations we observed bore no association with the clinical findings and were unimportant. We observed no differences between the groups with regard to seroconversion or the Montenegro skin test. However, the group that received a single dose of the vaccine and the one that received two doses with a 21-day interval displayed cutaneous induration significantly larger than in the control group, with 100%, 100%, and 66% conversion in the skin test, respectively. We concluded that the vaccine does not present any major side effect that would contraindicate its use in healthy individuals.

SANTOS, Lyvia de Jesus e VIEIRA, Maria Jésia. The role of the psychologist in hospitals and maternity wards in the state of Sergipe. Ciênc. saúde coletiva [online]. 2012, vol.17, n.5, pp. 1191-1202. ISSN 1413-8123..
This article seeks to reflect on the professional activity of the psychologist in the hospital context by examining the role of psychologists working in hospitals and maternity wards in the State of Sergipe. It seeks to identify the specific role of these professionals in hospitals and maternity wards, as well as their motivating forces and the difficulties encountered. This work is part of a broader project that sought to study not only the activity per se, but also training aspects of these professionals. The sample was analyzed using a qualitative and quantitative approach for thematic analysis. Results revealed that the characterization of the role of psychologists has a focus on psychotherapeutic work with patients before and after surgery, as well as the caregivers and family members of critically ill patients in the following units: ICU, ICC, oncology, dialysis and surgical wards, offering support, especially at the pre- and post-surgery phase.

ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the etiology and the serotypes of S. pneumoniae (Sp) in Mexican children with acute otitis media (AOM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study includessamples frompatientsdiagnosed with AOM at the Federico Gomez Children's Hospital of Mexico (2002-2003),with positive culture for Sp bacteriologically confirmed in middle ear fluid obtained by tympanocentesis. All Sp were serotyped. A total of 138 samples from 135 children with AOM were included.
RESULTS: Sp was isolated in 72 samples from 70 children. Sixty (85.7%) were previously healthy and 10 (14.3%) were immunocompromised. The most common serotypes were 6B and 19F (16.67%), and 6 A, 14 and 23F (15.27%).
CONCLUSION: The distribution of serotypes among the children with AOM in the study is similar to that reported in developing cities, and 63.9% of the isolated serotypes are found to be included in the 7-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV), 68.1% in the 10-Valent PCV and 83.3% in 13-Valent PCV.
Key words: otitis media, Streptococcus pneumoniae, serotyping; Mexico
RESUMEN
OBJETIVO: Conocer la etiología y serotipos de S. pneumoniae (Sp) en niños mexicanos, con otitis media aguda (OMA).
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Se incluyeron las muestras de pacientes con OMA del Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez (2002-2003), con cultivo positivo para Sp, (bacteriológicamente confirmados en el líquido del oído medio obtenido por timpanocentesis). Todos los Sp. fueron serotipificados. Se incluyeron 138 muestras de 135 niños con OMA.
RESULTADOS: Sp. se aisló en 72 muestras de 70 niños: 60 (85.7%) eran previamente sanos y 10 (14.3%) eran inmunocomprometidos. Los serotipos más frecuentes fueron 6B y 19F (16.67%), y 6 A, 14 y 23F (15.27%).
CONCLUSIONES: La distribución de los serotipos en niños con otitis media aguda fue similar a la reportada en ciudades en desarrollo y se observó que 63.9% de los serotipos aislados están incluidos en la vacuna conjugada 7-valente, 68.1% en la 10-valente y 83.3% en la 13-valente.
Palabras clave: otitis media, Streptococcus pneumoniae, serotipificación; México
Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common infections in the world, and mainly affects children. The epidemiology of acute otitis media over the last decade has indicated a change in the course of the disease, with more children experiencing recurring episodes during their first year. Since this is one of the diseases for which antibiotics are most indicated, it has brought about changes in the susceptibility to antibiotics of the pathogenic bacteria involved, as well as changes in treatment strategies.1
The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7-valent PCV) has shown its efficacy in preventing the specific Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes that cause otitis, and reducing the resistance of respiratory pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics.2,3 Before the 7-valent PCV was given universally in the United States, around 7 000 000 cases of AOM caused by S. pneumoniae had been estimated.4
Due to its importance and epidemiological frequency, AOM is one of the infectious processes for which antimicrobials are most frequently prescribed, and sometimes incorrectly. This is considered to be the cause of increased anti-microbial resistance in many parts of the world.5 The pathogens that are the most common cause of AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae (25-50%), Haemophilus influenzae (15-30%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (3-20%). Nevertheless, it was not possible to isolate any bacterial pathogen in 16% of cases or viral pathogen in 25% of cases.6,7
The leading bacterial causes of AOM in Mexico and worldwide are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza nontypable.8,9 Treating AOM caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in children under the age of two has become complicated in Mexico and around the world due to decreased susceptibility to antibiotics and the increase in more virulent serotypes, such as those included in the 7-valent PCV.10 The availability of local epidemiological information about the S. pneumoniae serotypes that cause AOM is therefore needed.
This epidemiological approach is of great interest as there is evidence that preventive measures can be taken once the S. pneumoniae serotypes involved in AOM are known, particularly those contained in the vaccine.3,10 Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the etiology and serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae that cause AOM in a selected group of Mexican children.
Material and Methods
This study was an open, observational, retrospective, cross-sectional study. Samples were included of patients diagnosed with AOM at the Federico Gomez Children's Hospital of Mexico between March 2002 and March 2003. The clinical characteristic of the patients selected was bacteriological confirmation using tympanocentesis to remove fluid from the middle ear in order to confirm the bacteriological diagnosis.
The patients were clinically evaluated by an otorhinolaryngology specialist and classified by the head of otorhinolaryngology. The tympanocentesis was performed with patients who needed a bacteriological diagnosis in order to identify the bacterial etiology and determine a specific treatment.
The procedure was performed by an otolaryngologist using microscopic vision. After the external auditory canal was cleaned, samples were taken using a centuria device. Informed consent from one of the parents of each patient was obtained before performing tympanocentesis. Patients excluded were those with a ruptured eardrum within 48 hours of performing tympanocentesis and those who had ventilation tubes and craniofacial deformations.
Samples taken from the middle ear were cultured in sheep blood agar at 5% and chocolate agar incubated at 37ºC for 24 hours in a CO2 atmosphere at 10%. Isolation of S.pneumoniae was identified based on colonial morphology microscopy, susceptibility to optoquine and solubility in bile.11 Serotyping was performed usingthe Quellung reaction with specific pneumococcal antiserums from the Statens Serum Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark). All isolations were typed according to group and factor based on Danish nomenclature.12
Results
Included were 138 samples from 135 patients diagnosed with AOM, and 135 bacterial isolations: 72 S. pneumoniae (52.2%), 44 H. influenzae nontypable (31.9%), 13 Moraxella catarrhalis (9.4%), two Staphylococcus aureus (1.4%), two Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.4%), one E. coli (0.7%), one Streptococcus pyogenes (0.7%) and three samples without germs (2.2%).
Of the 70 patients in which S. pneumoniae was isolated, 60 (85.7%) were previously healthy and 10 (14.3%) suffered from an underlying disease that made them immunocompromised. The average age of patients who had S. pneumonie isolated in their ear was 42.5 months with median of 22 months (range 5-109 months). Fifty five percent of patients were under 24 months (Table I). Two were diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 8 were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and treated with chemotherapy. The two patients with HIV presented recurrent otitis media on two occasions.
In terms of severity of the infection, of the total 72 cases of otitis, 64 (88.9%) episodes were classified as AOM, four (5.5%) as acute bilateral otitis, and four (5.5%) as recurrent otitis. The latter correspond to two samples from each of the two patients who presented two different episodes.
The serotypes identified in the S. pneumoniae isolates are shown in Table II. Four of those (6B, 14, 19Fand 23 F), which were found in 46 cases (63.9%) are contained in the 7-valent PCV, five (1, 6B, 14, 19F and 23 F), in 49 cases (68.1%), are in the 10-valent PCV and six (1, 6A, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F), in 60 cases (83.3%), are in the 13-valent PCV.
Discussion
AOM is one of the most common infections in the world, particularly among children under the age of 2 years. The bacterial pathogens in AOM that are most frequently isolated are S. pneumoniae, H. influenza nontypable,and M. catarrhalis, with S pneumoniae being that which is the leading cause of AOM and for which there is the least possibility of a spontaneous cure.13-14
S. pneumoniae is considered to be the more likely cause of complications such as spontaneous rupture of the eardrum and may even cause loss of hearing.15 In some developing countries, AOM and its complications may cause up to 50 000 deaths a year.16 Epidemiological surveillance studies show5,6,7 that before the 7-valent PCV vaccine was introduced, S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen isolated from fluid in the middle ear of children with AOM (47.7-53% ).17
The most frequent S. pnenumoniae serotypes in our study are: 6B, 19 F, 14, 23F and 6A. It is well known the serotypes that cause AOM worldwide vary according to a number of factors, such as age, health and geographical location.18-22
A review of the most prevalent serotypes involved in AOM in various geographical areas, including the United States ofAmerica, indicate that the most frequent ones are 6 A, 6 B, 14, 19 A, 19 F and 23 F.18-22 Of these six serotypes, four (6 B, 19 F, 14 and 23 F) coincide with the data obtained from our study. When comparing these with AOM-related serotypes in other countries, such as Costa Rica23 and Argentina, there are major differences, particularly in Costa Rica where serotypes 3 and 19F are significant. In Argentina, serotype 14 represents 53.5% of total AOM cases, in contrast to 15.2% in this study.18 In addition, in Europe,24-26 the most common serotypes are 1, 3, 6, 9V, 14, and 23F, whereas in our study we found only three of these (6,14 and 23). These examples clearly show geographical differences in the prevalence of serotypes that cause AOM. Therefore, each country or geographic region needs to conduct active epidemiological surveillance of the S. pneumoniae serotypes that cause AOM.
One point of particular importance is that major changes have occurred in the pathogens that cause AOM, after the 7-valent PCV vaccine was introduced, such as a reduction in S. penumoniae and an increase in nontypable H. influenzae.27-30 Other studies have shown a decrease in the percentage of vaccine serotypes and an increase in non-vaccine serotypes (1,3, 6A, 7, 10, 11 A, 15A, 16, 19A, 20 22, 29, 31, 33 F, 35, 37, 38, 42 and nontypable serotypes).30-32 In patients vaccinated with two to four 7-valent PCV doses, the most commonly isolated serotypes causing AOM were 3, 18A and 19A.32
Serotype 19A has increased substantially as a carrier in invasive infections and in AOM. Korea, Israel and Mexico have found 19A serotypes as carriers and in invasive forms.33-35
The most common AOM Sp serotypes worldwide are 6A, 6B, 14, 19A, 19F and 23F, while serotype 3 is rare.36 A Finnish study provides evidence of AOM prevention using 7-valent PCV.3
In addition to the 7-valent PCV vaccine's protective factors, it provides a number of other benefits, including: reducing the number of consultations related to AOM, reducing the need to use ventilation tubes for recurrent otitis, lowering the resistance of bacteria to penicillin and other antibiotics and strengthening the herd effect an indirect effect that has the greatest epidemiological impact.2,28,29,37
In a recent study in children associated with an insurance company and who received four doses of 7-valent PCV vaccine, consultations related to AOM decreased 42.7% and there was a reduction in antibiotic use.29
We found in our results that of all the S. pneumoniae serotypes isolated in the fluid of the middle ear, 63.9% were contained in the 7-valent PCV, 68.1% in the 10-valent PCV and 83.3% in the 13-valent PCV.
Our results could not be generalized to the entire Mexican population because in the study we only include a small group of children in a special population (Mexican children at a third level hospital, Children's Hospital of Mexico), from 2002 to 2003, before the universal 7-valent PCV was used in Mexico. Currently, there may now be new and different pneumococcal serotypes, therefore it is important to continue to conduct epidemiological studies.
These results highlight the need to use S. pneumoniaeconjugate vaccines universally, however, the regional epidemiology of predominant serotypes in AOM needs to be ascertained to develop recommendations suitable to each region. The importance of implementing epidemiological surveillance procedures should also be emphasized, so as to assess the impact and benefits of anti-pneumococcal vaccination.
Conclusions
Identifying the local epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumonaie serotypes associated with AOM is very important to developing the best prevention and treatment practices for pneumococcal otitis.
The only preventive action that may currently be taken against AOM caused by S. pneumoniae is the administration of S. pneumoniae conjugate vaccines.
Our results show that in a small group of Mexican children with AOM, 63.9% of S. pneumoniae serotypes identified as causing the disease are included in the 7-valent PCV vaccine.

These ideas for encouraging visitors to attend your science fair are excerpted from Science Buddies’ “A Guide to Planning a Science Fair.” Page numbers in the text below refer to pages in the PDF, found at.
Encouraging visitors to come and view the displays is a key part of the success of a science fair. For participating students, having visitors see their projects reinforces that their work matters to a larger community. Non-participating students who come to the fair may get ideas and become inspired for a time when they may have a chance to participate. Parents who visit show their appreciation for and help motivate their students. Administrators who visit will understand the extra work that you and your team put in to make the fair happen.
Here are some ways that you can promote your fair:
To invite students and teachers who are not participating in the fair, as well as school administrators and school district officials (e.g., science fair coordinator):
* Mention the fair at teachers’ meetings starting one month before the fair.
* Send invitations via email or on paper one month before the fair (see sample text on page 12).
* Send reminders via e-mail two weeks, one week, and one day before the fair.
* Have your classes create posters for the school (more details below).
* Make sure that the date of the fair appears on the school calendar.
* Ask students to write a newsletter or website article about the fair (more details below).
To encourage parents to attend:
* Two weeks before, send parents the “Final Science Fair Participation Reminder for Parents” on page 24. Send it as a flyer or as an email.
* Include information in the PTA newsletter.
* Give students extra credit if parents attend.
* The day before the fair, remind students to bring their parents.
Posters
Ask your classes, or work with the art teacher and his or her classes, to create posters and even directional signs. Here are some signage ideas:
* Publicity posters: Decorate the school and publicize the fair before the event. Include date, time, and location.
* Event directions: Where to park, where to go for the fair.
* Science-themed murals for the walls (most appropriate for elementary schools): What about children painting different habitats? Or murals of other science themes, such as the solar system?
Newsletter or Website Articles
Have students write a school newsletter or website article that includes:
* Date, time, and location of the fair.
* Encouragement for students who are working on their projects.
* A reminder for participants’ parents to consult their guides (distributed by teachers) on how to help their children.
* Some exciting and fantastic facts, such as a sample of unique topics already chosen by students or quotes from students about what they are experiencing.

Apr. 5, 2002 MOSCOW, Idaho – The genetic intricacies of salmon sexes and the apparent effects of pollution on both Puget Sound and Lake Mead fishes were among topics reported on by scientists gathered here this week for a symposium on salmon recovery.
Sponsored by the University of Idaho – Washington State University Center for Reproductive Biology and the National Marine Fisheries Service Northwest Fisheries Center in Seattle, the symposium drew nearly 70 scientists primarily from the Northwest.
Researchers from universities and tribal, federal and state fisheries departments spent two days reviewing the question of whether pollution in popular waters is affecting fish reproduction, salmon genetics and conservation efforts.
In Las Vegas Bay, an arm of Lake Mead that is fed by 130 million gallons of treated sewage and other contaminated industrial runoff, U.S. Geological Survey scientist Steven Goodbred reported on an extensive study of carp, razorback suckers and largemouth bass.
That work, among the longest running studies of its kind ever undertaken, did find evidence that the fishes showed reduced levels of sex hormones, primarily testosterone.
The result is that both the development of male fish and sperm quality is reduced in fish found in Las Vegas Bay, Goodbred said.
Lyndal Johnson, a National Marine Fisheries Service scientist at Seattle, reported on work in Puget Sound. She said the agency found a strong correlation between abnormal levels of a sex hormone derivative in English sole and the fishes’ proximity to major sewage outfalls.
The study sampled areas ranging from heavily developed Elliott Bay near Seattle to near pristine Hood Canal.
University of British Columbia scientist Luis Afonso reported that tests with young chinook salmon exposed to estrogenic compounds, undiluted bleached kraft pulp mill effluent and diluted sewage effluent did show apparent sex reversal.
They reported their findings during a session led by James Nagler, a UI assistant professor of biology, who sampled fall chinook from the Columbia River’s Hanford Reach. He found many of the females carried genetic markers that suggested they began life as males.
Whether that showed the fish had reversed sex early in development or were merely biological oddities remained open to speculation, Nagler said.
Nagler reported that subsequent sampling in the Hanford Reach, Yakima River and below Bonneville Dam showed the phenomenon occurred elsewhere in the basin as well but there was no apparent pattern.
WSU zoology professor Gary Thorgaard, who worked with Nagler on the original study published in late 2000, led another session about the state of the current science of salmon sex determination.
Thorgaard reported that his team at WSU is continuing to work on a definitive test. Scientists also reported during the session on their efforts to find genetic markers that indicate the genetic sex of salmon.
Other scientists from WSU, NMFS, U.S. Geological Survey and the University of British Columbia all reported their own efforts to find the still-elusive definitive genetic test for sex in salmon.
Another panel led by NMFS scientist Penny Swanson of Seattle focused on various strategies to preserve the genetic heritage of Northwest salmon runs.
Panelists included UI zoology professor and conference organizer Joseph Cloud, who reported on efforts to preserve salmon sperm by freezing it in liquid nitrogen. He also reported on work to preserve ovarian tissue from females.
Cloud reported that he and Nagler had successfully transplanted testes that had been cryogenically preserved and induced them to produce sperm. They have also transplanted frozen ovarian tissue but whether the females will produce eggs is still more than a month away.
Cloud said the conference reflects the close working relationship of UI and WSU scientists and the Center for Reproductive Biology. He said plans are in the works to establish a closer working relationship with scientists on the two campuses and the National Marine Fisheries Service Northwest Fisheries Center..

Mar. 29, 2012 The land around Yellowstone and Glacier national parks might look like it's filling up with people and houses, but it's nothing compared to the rate of development around some other U.S. national parks, according to a new Montana State University study.
While population densities rose 246 percent around Yellowstone/Grand Teton and 210 percent around Glacier between 1940 and 2000, they surged 3,092 percent around the Mojave National Preserve in California, 2,962 percent around the Colorado River parks and almost 2,473 percent around the Everglades National Park/Big Cypress National.
At the same time, the researchers noted that the increases were averages. Changes differed widely among the 57 parks in their study.
"Parks largely in the East like Great Smoky Mountain changed dramatically from being surrounded mostly by forests and farms to cities, suburbs and ranchettes," Hansen said. "This was also true at a moderate level for some western parks such as Olympic and Rocky Mountain. Others, such as Yellowstone and Bighorn Canyon, that we locally think are changing rapidly, had very slow rates of growth relative to the national rates."
In the course of their work, the researchers divided the 57 national parks into five categories according to types and rates of land use change around the parks. Twenty-five parks were classified as wildland-protected. Sixteen were "wildland developable." Five were agricultural. Eight were exurban. Three were urban.
Yellowstone, Glacier, the Grand Canyon and Yosemite National Park were among the wildland-protected parks. As such, they share some common issues,. Many of the private lands around wildland parks are protected by conservation easements and support wildlife, such as bison on Ted Turner's Flying D Ranch near Yellowstone.
Approximately 35 percent of the land around Yellowstone and 45 percent of the land around Glacier is private,.".

Aug. 3, 2012 Screaming through the thin Martian atmosphere at hypersonic speed, the Mars Science Laboratory is about to experience heat and pressure up to three times more intense than when a space shuttle returned to Earth, and NASA engineers hope to soon have the data to prove it.
A suite of 14 sensors are embedded in the MSL spacecraft's heat shield, which will protect the Curiosity rover during its seven-minute plunge toward the Red Planet. Seven sensors will measure temperatures within the heat shield during entry, while the remaining seven sensors will measure changes in atmospheric pressure being exerted on the heat shield.
All of the measurements will be recorded aboard Curiosity for playback to Earth, both during the entry and descent, and three to four days later after the rover safely touches down.
The team responsible for the instruments -- which are called MEDLI, for MSL Entry Descent and Landing Instrumentation -- can't wait.
"This will be a first for us," said Jim Pittman, NASA's head of hypersonic research. "We've never had the chance before to collect this kind of high-quality data from a spacecraft entering another planet's atmosphere."
Information about what Curiosity's heat shield experiences during entry and how it responds is expected to help engineers design future aircraft and spacecraft to better fly through a planet's atmosphere -- including Earth's -- at hypersonic velocities, or more than five times the speed of sound.
MEDLI's data also will be used to develop future Mars entry systems that are safer, lighter weight and more reliable, which in turn would allow future landers to be larger and more scientifically capable.
The $28 million experiment managed by NASA's Space Technology Program is the first Technology Demonstration Mission to fly in space. MEDLI originated within the agency's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate..

At the weekend, I had the opportunity to participate in a science communication master class as part of the Famelab competition. During it, the question of “why do we communicate science” was raised and the same sort of answers I had heard before were given: science is important to society, people need to be educated, science is entertaining and fun, people need to know what tax payers money goes on, PhD students need to tell people why they’re being paid by the tax payer without ever having contributed a penny in income tax. I had heard these before, but this weekend, I decided that the last two weren’t a good enough reason on their own.
First the PhD student and their non-tax paying ways. The PhD student might not be paying income tax or PRSI, but they do pay plenty of VAT in their day to day lives. While they might enjoy their research and are considered a student, they are still performing a job (even if it’s not defined as such). They provide teaching and demonstrating hours for undergraduate students, and by the very nature of carrying out research are doing a job for their supervisor and the greater research community. PhD students work long hours for low “pay” (it’s a stipend, not a wage, this definition matters to HR and Revenue), so it’s not as if they’re taking this tax-money and spending it on all the luxury while never seeing the inside of a lab. Is there some sort of underlying guilt for getting to study and research and be paid for it?

Studies of the Axial Shift and the Spin Hamiltonian Parameters for Mn2+ in a CdS Crystal
The axial shift and the spin Hamiltonian parameters (zero-field splitting D, the g factors and the hyperfine structure constants A// and A) for Mn2+ in a CdS crystal are studied theoretically in this work. The calculations are carried out by using the perturbation formulae of these parameters for a 3d5 ion under trigonally distorted tetrahedra based upon the cluster approach, where the ligand orbital and spin-orbit coupling contributions are taken into account in a uniform way. From the studies, the impurity Mn2+ is found not to occupy the host Cd2+ site exactly but to experience a small outward shift of 0.018 Å away from the ligand triangle along the C3 axis. The above impurity axial shift leads to a much smaller trigonal distortion than the host Cd2+ site in CdS. The calculated spin Hamiltonian parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data.

Colon cancer runs in families and start as polyps. Start with a colonscopy at age 40 if in one of those families. Otherwise 50. If no polyp go every 10 years for a look. If polyp every three years until clear. Removing polyps stops cancer. Why get to a cancer stage, when polyp removal is total prevention? Perforation should never happen in good hands. Only a colonoscopy sees small polyps.I am a retired physician who did over 1,900 with no perforations!Report Abuse | Link to this |
Every time I have a colonoscopy I have polyps removed.Report Abuse | Link to this |
I consider this to be a good thing.
I believe telling me not to bother any more now that I have passed 70 is poor advice.
I am in otherwise excellent health and would like to believe it is possible for me to live another twenty years. If so, I would think it would be a pretty slow growing cancer that would not turn out to be a problem for me.
I had one once...they didn't go all the way around the bend because was too challenging i guess. I'd rather them back out than pull my intestines from the ligaments holding them in place or worse yet perforating me.Report Abuse | Link to this |

This spider creeps on clean energy...
Good gardeners know that a quick way to repel spiders from plants is to spray them with salt water. But salt water – the most abundant clean energy source on Earth – is actually the power source for our kit’s amazing Salt Water Arachnoid.
Just activate the fuel cell module with a salt water mixture, and the magnesium metal sheet (three sheets included) will send the spider creeping and crawling for about five to seven continuous hours. To stop, remove the fuel cell module, rinse with water and dry.All kit materials are environmentally safe, non-heat producing and non-toxic. Once assembled, the salt water powered spider measures 1.77" x 4.72" x 4.33".
Recommended for ages 10+.

An article in the February 11, 2010, issue of Nature describes the sequencing of the complete genome of a 4,000-year old Eskimo (Saqqaq). This is by far the oldest complete genome ever published (only 8 human genomes have been reported so far). The article can be accessed here.
What's interesting is the kind of information we can derive about this individual from such data:
1. He was of blood type A+
2. Had a high likelihood of going bald
3. He had dark hair
4. Had dry earwax (an indication of a propensity to get infections)
5. He had dark skin
6. He had brown eyes
7. He had shovel-shaped front teeth
8. He was adapted to cold climates
Last but not least, this individual is more closely related to people from Siberia than modern Native Americans, implying that there was a wave of migration to the New World some 5,500 years ago, independent of the migration that led to the rise of modern Native Americans.
As our ability to sequence DNA continues to expand, a more clear image of the past continues to unfold.
Fascinating research! The migration results here reminded me of a recent genetic study of the Indian populaion that revealed divergence of North versus South Indian populations, with hints of a possibly migrated group from Central Asia/Europe and a genetically distinct group ancestral to the southern population ( ) Another step towards a DNA-based image of the past.

Reward offer announced in Paeroa homicide
Waikato Police investigating the June 2012 murder of a Paeroa business man believe the introduction of a reward may prompt those holding key pieces of information to the case to come forward.
Detective Sergeant Glenn Tinsley said with Operation Olive, the investigation into the murder of Jordan Voudouris, now into its eighth month, the enquiry team still believe that someone could hold information that can solve this mystery.
As such today, the Police Commissioner authorised that a reward of up to $50,000 will be paid for material information or evidence, which leads to the identity and conviction of any person or persons responsible for the death of Mr Voudouris.
In addition-.
"Often in cases such as this people's loyalties change as time goes on and we urge anyone who may have information not made available to us earlier to come forward now. Similarly there may be someone with information who has held back hoping the murder would be solved without them having to get involved."
Mr Tinsley said it is important for both 01 July 2013.
"The bottom line is that if you know something, we need to hear from you."
Paeroa businessman Jordan Voudouris, 55, was killed in the early hours of Monday 18 June."

Not enough printer paper? LA Unified teachers get more than $2 million in help to buy supplies
Tim Boyle/Getty Images News
teachers get to the point
Milca Ruz, a third grade teacher at Garvanza Elementary School in northeast L.A. probably spends about $4,000 of her own money on school supplies each year.
Ruz, 39, has been a teacher since 1996. These days her worry is printer paper. She is allotted two boxes, or 10,000 sheets, a year. Only a few months into the school year, she's working her way through the second box. With continuing budget cuts, a new reading and language arts curriculum, and not enough books, she uses a lot of paper making copies so students can do grammar exercises.
Well, here's a happy ending for once. Thanks to a unique partnership between the district and the Wasserman Foundation, which launched in November, Ruz and other teachers like her, have received hundreds of dollars to pay for supplies.
To date, teachers have received more than $2 million in donations from parents under this partnership; teachers have used the money to buy school supplies ranging from crayons to digital cameras, said Lydia Ramos, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District.

Thieves snatch smartphones from people's hands on public transit
Erika Aguilar/KPCC
LA Kings fans flooded cell phone transmitters Monday night in downtown Los Angeles sending messages about the Kings Stanley Cup victory.
You’re waiting for the bus or the train and maybe you've got 15 minutes to kill. So you whip out your iPhone or Andriod and check Facebook, scroll through your Twitter feed or text a friend you’ve been meaning to catch up with.
We all do it - but to an opportunistic thief, it’s as if we’re waving a couple of hundred-dollar bills in his face.
More and more people are snatching up cell phones, iPads, laptops and other electronic gadgets on Metro buses and trains, turn around and sell it,” said Lt. Matthew Rodriguez with the Sheriff's Department Transit Services Bureau North.
In a Metro blog post, the agency writes, “Trains appear to be the preferred venues for cell phone thefts, perhaps because trains can hold more passengers and buses are manned by bus drivers whose presence may deter some thieves.”
"They snatch them as the doors are closing and the train is moving on away from the station," said Metro rider Jeffrey Linneman. He said he's seen this happen to a woman at the Wilshire/Vermont Red Line station.
Linneman said he once dozed off while riding the Blue Line station about four months ago with his wallet exposed from his backpack but woke up when he felt a man digging into it.
“He just smiled at me and said something like, ‘I saw you sleeping,’” Linneman said.
That’s what cops call opportunity crimes. It seems to happen often on Metro’s Blue and Green light rail lines, Lt. Rodriguez said. He added that more than half the reports of stolen electronic devices and jewelry this year have occurred on those two rail lines.
“I’ve seen everything on the Blue Line,” said Metro rider L.P. Simmons, who often rides the train from Long Beach. Simmons said people have tried to sell him drugs, DVDs, casino chips, candy, water, jewelry and even sex. He'd like to see more of a police presence on board, but Simmons said riders also have to be diligent.
“A lot of people won’t report crime. They’ll just turn their heads and be apathetic,” he said.
Rodriguez said authorities are aware of the vendor problem on the Blue Line, and they've been trying to eliminate it. He said the spike in cell phone thefts has prompted them to increase the security presence on the Blue and Green lines.
Authorities say that if you’re not talking on the phone, resist the urge to toy with it and put it away until you're off the bus or train.
There are apps that can help track your stolen or lost cell phone. Most trains and buses have video cameras on board that could record the crime.
Rodriguez said this is a trend that’s happening across the country in places like Chicago and New York City where more than 40 percent of all robberies involve smartphones. In Washington D.C., thieves steal cell phones in 38 percent of all robberies.
Federal legislation announced in April joins four major cell phone providers with the FCC to create a central database to track stolen devices. The first database is supposed to launch by the end of October.

DAR gets ugly with Kashyap, Phantom
India’s DAR Motion Pictures is partnering with Phantom Films to produce Ugly, the next project from Anurag Kashyap, whose Gangs Of Wasseypur is screening in Directors Fortnight.
Kashyap is currently scripting the dark psychological thriller, which is scheduled to start shooting in the third quarter of this year, before he starts work on previously-announced period thriller Bombay Velvet.
“It’s a dark story but more mainstream than Anurag has been known to do before – perhaps as mainstream as Gangs Of Wasseypur,” said Arun Rangachari, chairman of DAR Motion Pictures’ parent company, DAR Capital Group.
Gangs Of Wasseypur is a two-part gangster epic backed by Indian studio Viacom18 Motion Pictures. Phantom Films is the production company that Kashyap founded last year with three other filmmakers – Vikramaditya Motwane, Madhu Mantena and Vikas Bahl. He also runs the Anurag Kashyap Films banner with Guneet Monga.
DAR Motion Pictures is also a co-producer on Amit Kumar’s upcoming thriller Monsoon Shootout, with the UK’s Trevor Ingman and other European partners; Ritesh Batra’s Lunchbox, which is currently being set up as an Indo-European co-production, and Vasan Bala’s Peddlers, which is screening here in Critics Week.
In addition to producing independent Indian films for a global audience, DAR is producing films in three other strands – big-ticket Bollywood films with directors such as Nikhil Advani; genre franchises, including a horror franchise in partnership with Anubhav Sinha, and youth-oriented films.
The company is also developing three projects across different budget ranges with Sudhir Mishra.

Vertigo ramps up StreetDance, Monsters sequels
Falk Hentschel and Sofia Boutella [pictured] to star in StreetDance 2 3D; Monsters 2 signs Brent Bonacorso and Jesse Atlas to direct.
UK producer-distributor Vertigo Films is ramping up sequels for its hits StreetDance 3D and Monsters.
StreetDance 2 3D will start shooting June 6, again be directed by Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini, and George Sampson will take a larger role in the sequel.
Falk Hentschel and Sofia Boutella (of Nike ads fame) take the lead roles.
The shoot will travel from London to Paris, Rome, Berlin and Moscow, as the story follows a European super squad being formed to take on a top American group. Jane English again writes the script, and Vertigo’s Allan Niblo and James Richardson are producing.
The film, shooting for eight weeks, will have a budget of about £7m compared to £4m for the first one.
Vertigo’s Rupert Preston promises it will “up the ante” on the first film.
The BFI and BBC Films are backing, and the sequel is a co-production with Italy’s Eagle Pictures and Germany’s Film Eins.
Vertigo will release around Easter 2012.
Protagonist is handling sales and has sold to France (Metropolitan), Germany (Square One), Italy (Eagle) Benelux (E1), and other territories.
Monsters 2 will be directed by emerging hotshots Brent Bonacorso and Jesse Atlas, with original director Gareth Edwards serving as executive producer alongside actor Scoot McNairy and Vertigo’s Rupert Preston. Vertigo’s Niblo and Richardson have also brought in Ben Pugh and Rory Aitken from Between the Eyes as producers.
This story will continue by introducing a teacher living in a protected walled city, who has to go into the infected zone to find his long-lost brother, a former military man who is now a Col. Kurtz-esque figure. Niblo promises “lots more creatures” than the original.
No cast is attached yet but Niblo confirms there is a “quite a lot of interest.”
Vertigo told Screen that the project could shoot (for six weeks) in Argentina or the Dominican Republic.
Niblo assures fans that the sequel won’t betray the spirit of the original: “We wouldn’t have done it if we didn’t find the right talent [in the two new directors]. Gareth loves their vision. People want to see more of this world.”
The film will be delivered at the end of 2012. Ingenious is also financing with Vertigo.
The budget will be bigger than Monsters but still under $5m, with Preston noting that like the original the sequel would deliver “massive bang for its buck.”
Monsters actor Scoot McNairy stars in another Vertigo production, a camping thriller called A Night In The Woods, directed by Richard Parry.
The film shot under the radar in Dartmoor and is in the final stages of post for an autumn release.
Vertigo will start shooting The Sweeney, written and directed by Nick Love and starring Ray Winstone and Plan B (aka Ben Drew).
That film will shoot fro October in London, on a budget of £4m. No sales company is attached yet.
Also shooting now is Vertigo production Pusher, a London-set remake of the Nicolas Winding Refn film now directed by Luis Prieto and starring Agyness Deyn and Richard Coyle.
Also, the company says it has a new project for Drive director Nicholas Winding Refn in development. Refn made Bronson and Valhalla Rising with Vertigo.
Vertigo’s slate also includes the 3D film adaptation of Horrid Henry (which will be released on July 29 on 450 screens) and the release of Fred Cavayé’s French thriller Point Blank starring Gilles Lellouche, Roschdy Zem, Gerard Lanvin, and Elena Anaya.

Battlestar Galactica: The Plan
Given the supposed significance of the Five in the wider mythology of the show, four of them are almost inconsequential to this story.
Since the beginning, it was often touted that the Cylons had a plan. So vague and ambiguous was this that it ran through the bones of the entire series, instilling a sense of dread and foreboding rarely captured so perfectly on screen. As season three limped on, however, it became apparent that the Cylons might not have been the Machiavellian plotters that the writers would have you believe. And so, The Plan unfolds.
In heading back to the early days of the series for this TV film special, there is a wealth of possibility to work with. We might see Cavil murdering Daniel, The Final Five's first encounter with the Colonial Centurions, even Cavil murdering his parents and altering their memories. Then again, fifteen minutes in, it seems we're expecting too much. Unfortunately, The Plan squanders much of its running time, even in its extended edition, in desperately trying to stitch together very disparate pieces of the story. It takes some of the most exciting, throwaway moments of the series and tries to tack on significance in such a way that feels like a bit of a hustle. The main problem in this particular body of work is the script. Jane Espenson's work on Buffy was strong, cohesive and interesting, but aboard the Galactica, she has singularly managed to create some of the worst episodes of the series ('Dirty Hands', 'Deadlock'). The writing can be extremely jarring in places, lacking any element of subtlety, and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the BSG universe. The disappearance of Shelley Godfrey, as one of many examples, is explained in such a ludicrous way that I found myself wishing for Cavil to suffocate me and wipe my memories, too.
With what they have to work with, the cast excel again and again, but they are done a great disservice by the material. Boomer and Simon's respective struggles with their Cylon nature create a sense of pathos that is genuinely affecting. Dean Stockwell's performances as two different copies of the Brother Cavil model are instantly both unsettling and gentle. On Caprica, he infiltrates Anders' resistance cell and finds himself sympathetic to his 'parents' and the human race; on Galactica, Cavil 2.0 grows more hateful and vicious as his 'plan', for lack of a better word, begins to unravel. The climactic dialogue between the two Cavil copies is a rare moment where the script finally rises to the legacy of the show. And given the supposed significance of the Five in the wider mythology of the show, four of them are almost inconsequential to this story.
Edward James Olmos's direction, particularly in the scenes where the holocaust commences, imbues the piece with the ambition we've come to expect from Ron Moore's vision. Ultimately, though, despite the positives, what we have here is a fairly weak and unremarkable contribution to the epic story of Galactica. For as unfulfilled by The Plan as I was, I ask one favour of you. Grab a glass of ambrosia and join me in a toast: "To Galactica, the best ship in the fleet." You'll be sorely frakking missed.

To be effective, Scrum Product Owners need to have a firm grasp on the value drivers for their product, and a keen sense of how to use agile practices and Scrum to maximize that value. The Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO) assessments allow people to validate their understanding of Scrum and product ownership, and how they would respond to real situations that would challenge them.
Those that pass the PSPO assessments will receive the corresponding industry recognized certification. There are two options for Scrum Product Owner assessment: PSPO I and PSPO II. These assessments are sequential, meaning that the PSPO I must be passed before attempting the much more difficult PSPO II..

Telematics to Provide Free Webinar
Insurers Focus on Telematics Post Gender Ruling
Telematics Update announced that free registration is now open for its exclusive Webinar, “Insurers Focus on Telematics Post Gender Ruling.” The Webinar will explore how insurers react to the gender ruling by implementing telematics technologies; and the key business and tech challenges associated with these new solutions.
The free interactive event will be held on January 31st at 10 a.m. GMT and is open to the insurance telematics community.
It is estimated that by 2019, 30 percent of all auto insurance policies will utilize telematics systems as insurers begin to use these systems for an accurate risk assessment and enhanced claims process to increase their bottom lines.
“The quantity and quality of data currently available is a major concern for insurance companies,” said Ruthana Foulkes, Director, Telematics Update. “But with a few solutions having gone through their first renewal periods, accurate data showcasing how driving behavior actually relates to claims and risk is starting to become available.”
To understand these key developments in the insurance business, Telematics Update’s “Insurers Focus on Telematics Post Gender Ruling” 45-minute Webinar includes live Q&A's and will be delivered by key industry figures Paul Stacy, Director, Wunelli; and Ashley Prebble, Partner, Norton Rose.
The debate will cover:
- The risk of indirect discrimination when using other factors as proxy for gender to ensure all telematics systems comply and any ambiguity is removed
- How to design a bespoke underwriting business models for different customer types such as teen, high-risk etc. to develop and deploy highly targeted products and solutions
- The perfect set of device features and benefits such as fraud prevention, quality data and low cost to assess which of the smartphone, OBD2 or black box has those key to your business
The Webinar is a unique opportunity to hear first-hand how some of the premier thought-leaders in the insurance telematics ecosystem are strategizing to adapt to the new technologies and revenue opportunities presented by insurance telematics.

The Point Loma women’s soccer team has been selected as the No. 3 seed in the National Christian Collegiate Athletic Association (NCCAA) West Regional Championships.
The Sea Lions were set to face No. 2 seed Azusa Pacific in the first round on Nov. 14. The match took place at the Cougar Soccer Complex.
The winner of the PLNU-APU match will then play at No. 1 seed California Baptist on Nov. 17, at 2 p.m. for the NCCAA West Region title. The winner of the region will advance to the NCCAA National Tournament which will be held in Kissimmee, Fla., Nov. 28-Dec. 1.
Point Loma earned the No. 3 seed in the West after posting a 12-4-2 record. The Sea Lions placed third in the PacWest standings after collecting
29 points (9-3-2). They finished third behind fellow NCCAA West Region participants California Baptist (39 points) and Azusa Pacific (36).
PLNU is currently in the transition from NAIA to NCAA Division II and during the next two academic years the Sea Lions are not eligible to participate in NCAA Championship events.
MEN’S BASKETBALL
The Point Loma men’s basketball team got a taste of one of the top teams in the country on Nov. 9 when it fell to No. 3 Alabama Huntsville 58-44 in the season opener for both teams.
Senior Todd Campbell led the Sea Lions with six rebounds, six assists and five points. All five of his points came from the free-throw line.
PLNU put forth a valiant effort on the defensive end to keep itself in the game despite hitting only 28 percent of its shots. The Sea Lions held preseason All-American Jaime Smith to just seven points and 2-of-8 shooting from the field, including 1-of-4 from behind the arc. Last season Smith was the nation’s leader in 3-point percentage after hitting 48.6 percent of his attempts from the perimeter. As a team, PLNU limited UAH to just 3-of-13 shooting from long range.
The Sea Lions got great contributions of the bench to outscore the Chargers’ reserves 29-19. Carter Warnock led PLNU in scoring with seven points. Each member of the Sea Lions scored in the contest. Every Sea Lion but one also grabbed a rebound as PLNU lost the rebounding battle by just one (37-36), despite missing 14 more shots. Point Loma was particularly aggressive on the offensive glass, outrebounding UAH 14-9 and outscoring them in second chance points (10-9).
The Point Loma men’s basketball team was set to get back in action Nov. 13 when it traveled to Trevecca Nazarene.
WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
The Point Loma women’s basketball team had its final tune-up game before the start of the 2012-13 season as it played Vanguard in an exhibition Nov. 8. The Sea Lions fell in the contest 81-52.
Nyla Bailey returned to the form that earned her All-American honors last season by scoring 21 points and grabbing seven rebounds. She hit 9 of 17 shots from the field and 3 of 4 at the free-throw line.
Savannah Erskins provided the outside shooting by hitting three treys. She scored 11 points and led the team with five assists.
The Sea Lions will open the season Nov. 17 against Biola at 6 p.m. The game will be part of Homecoming weekend for PLNU.
WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL
Point Loma’s Delaney McCraney posted 24 kills, had 15 digs and had five service aces to lead the Sea Lions to a 25-21, 26-24, 21-25, 25-16 Pacific West Conference volleyball win over Holy Names on Nov. 7 in Golden Gymnasium.
The win for the Sea Lions improved their overall record to 10-15 on the season and to 6-9 in the PacWest Division. Holy Names is now 11-14 in 2012 and is 8-6 in conference play.
PLNU was set to close out its first-ever season in the NCAA Division II conference on Nov. 10 against Dominican.
In addition to McCraney’s outstanding numbers, Kelli LeClair added 10 kills and 15 digs, while Natalie Hamill dished 45 assists. Katie Lopez led the Hawks with 11 kills and 14 digs, with Rachel Vartanian adding 10 of each.

National Seal Sanctuary
Issue 54
25th January 2011
Back
First we would like to say sorry for the long time between updates. Once again the Sanctuary has had a very busy winter rescuing grey seal pups from around the South West coastline. You can check out all the latest news by
clicking here
to read about this season´s rescues.
We have had a couple of new arrivals, first was Guido rescued on the 15th January 2011 from Porthgwidden, St Ives. This little boy was 25 kilos but had bite wounds to flippers and face. He is 16 weeks old and this week was moved through to the main hospital from isolation 2. He is doing well and self feeding hopefully it will not be too long before he moves to our outside nursery pools and mixes with other pups.
Next was Flo rescued on the 18th January 2011 from Porthmeor also at St Ives, she was 8 weeks old and weighed 16 kilos, she had ruckley breathing puncture wounds and a missing tooth.
We are now in the middle of the rescue season for grey seals and we now have many in the convalescent pool. The residents are behaving themselves.
Snoopy seems to mellowed over the summer and was happy to go into the convalescent pool with the others, she has even taken to going swimming in the pool with the other residents.
Sheba has taken to being the new 'Magnus' in this pool. A few years ago we had an old male seal in this pool who used to sit in the corner and wait for feeding time, Sheba now likes to do the same thing.
All the girls are looking well rounded in time for their annual moult.
Ray gave one of the team a bit of a scare the other day when he came up behind them, all he wanted was the water from the hose sprayed into his mouth.
Snoopy (
photo below
) also celebrated her 30th birthday this weekend and all the staff sang happy birthday to her and a few extra fish thrown her way.
As per every year there are always an argument or two in this pool between Flipper and Yulelog. Both have received a few wounds which are being treated by the Animal Care Team, but as always it does not last long and both are back to being best friends.
Marlin (
photo below
) is doing well with target training despite his lack of vision and puts his trust in the team completely, he will now come out fully on to the haul out area, he can still have his grumpy days, and will sit at the other end of the pool near the waterfall where the team cannot get to him if he does not want to do his training.
It has been 4 months now since Babyface arrived here at the Sanctuary and he has fully settled in with his new family Sija and Luna.
Andy and Chaff, our fur seals, have put on a few kilos over the winter months so both are now on new year diets to shed those extra pounds. Training continues do well with both Andy and Chaff.
Visitors to the Sanctuary over the last week have had a bit of a treat, as we had cleaned out the sea lion´s pool and it took a few days to refill. It meant feeding the sea lions from the outside of the enclosure, but visitors at the underwater viewing windows managed to get a good view and the children where comparing their height to sea lions, the sea lions were definitely taller.
André is still sounding like a squeaky door and continues to bark on a daily basis.
Photo below: Noito
The penguins have been enjoying some new enrichments toys, we have been using bath toys. Unfortunately the penguins showed no interest in them, so the toys have now been removed and its back to the drawing board for new games.
We have also been trying to weigh the penguins, so at feeding time we bring the scales into the enclosure in the hope they will stand on them, but it is taking a while for the penguins get used to the new object, and refuse to stand near it. All the penguins are feeding well and we have started to introduce small herring to their diet, which seems to be a big hit.
Starsky and Hutch, our otters, have had an increase in food as the winter months have been a little on the chilly side. Starsky and Hutch have had an extra chick in their food box, also have been treated to mill worms, which get hidden around the enclosure, where they have to use their little hands to get at the worms. Hutch has also overtaken Starsky and is now the bigger of the two.
All the animals in the paddocks have had extra food over the winter due to the cold, and are all looking nice and healthy.
The ponies are still managing to poke their heads through the fence and trying to eat the extra long grass just out of their reach.
Reef (
photo below
) is still doing daily patrols of the Sanctuary, checking and making sure everything is ok.
Paranormal Investigators spentan evening at the Sanctuary recently, confirming strange noises and going-ons at Gweek. Staff had heard voices in the main reception building and seen things down at the seal pools. The ouija board done later in the evening revealed Isabelle Rose who had passed away in 1928, but had arrived at Gweek on a boat, we are now doing some research to find out if this is true.
Boo, Roz, Wellington, Dap, Andy´s Platform, Fats Domino and the noisiest pup Rocket Dog
were released back into the wild on Monday 24th January 2011 at Gwithian.

Seattle University Fact Sheet
<|endofexample|>
ONE MEDIA CRITIC, Liz Swasey, won't cry if and when Disney/ABC drops Nightline for Late Night With David Letterman. Her reason: On June 20, 1991, Nightline broadcast allegations that the Reagan-Bush team connived with future arms client Iran to unseat Jimmy Carter, then didn't follow up when a congressional investigation "cleared" it in 1993.
Do right-wing media watchdogs have to reach that far back to find a beef with Nightline? The left-wing Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting regularly dings Nightline for skewing right and white in its choice of guests and experts and for favoring "elite opinion" and government sources (though not so much as Fox, or even PBS's NewsHour). But give credit where it's due: Ted Koppel is the sharpest, most serious anchor in the business, and his show is the best of the feeble TV news bunch. His show's plight is a grim telltale of how the media and marketing winds are blowing in an anxious time, when no one knows anything and everyone's afraid to get left out in the old—er, cold.
When ABC's scheme became public, media experts and buyers swarmed to explain what it all meant: Media conglomerates couldn't keep supporting prestigious "modestly profitable" shows like Nightline; they had to go for the bigger, younger audiences of hip shows like Letterman, whose ad time costs 38 percent more than Nightline's. But it turns out Nightline's audience is larger. And it has, according to Koppel (who's not given to overstatement) earned ABC at least half a billion dollars in 20 years. May all your ventures enjoy such modest profits.
Ah, but it's not the numbers, it's the demographics, the marketeers say: You gotta get the young'uns, especially those elusive 18- to 34-year-old males, while they're still forming habits and "brand loyalties." Come 50 (and I admit, it's coming toward me fast) and you become an Invisible One, commercially and demographically irrelevant. Boomers, the first generation to become a commercially targeted subculture, feared and decried as a hegemonic horde that would swamp everyone else, are now a pariah plurality, written off by marketers, media, and our president (who's scurrying to perforate Social Security before boomer retirees can collect).
But where's the logic? Nightline's audience is age 50 on average; Letter- man's is just four years younger—hardly springtime in Fort Lauderdale. The same marketing mavens who talk of snaring impressionable young consumers say brand loyalties are a thing of the past, that you never really get customers, you have to keep getting them again and again. And who are the adventurous novelty-seeking consumers? Seems like the 50-year-olds I know are always casting about for the latest restaurant, book, or travel destination, while the 18-year-olds are eating at McDonald's and watching Scream 2 again.
This suggests two possibilities. Either advertisers and media executives, seized by collective delusion, are throwing money down the Younger and Dumber rat hole—or there's a logic to the strategy that they don't talk about. As the dot-gone bubble proved, any mania is possible, but I doubt this one is all delusion; money only goes down rat holes for so long without a payoff. So perhaps the operative word isn't "younger" but "dumber." Advertisers don't just buy numbers and demographics; they buy "environments," contexts conducive to their messages. At the most obvious level, airlines don't want to advertise beside plane-crash stories. At a more pernicious level, if you're trying to persuade people they need dangerous, gas-guzzling, road-hogging $50,000 mountain machines to drive to work, does it really make sense to advertise in media that stimulate their critical faculties and social consciences? Nightline may have gotten more fluffy and mawkish lately as Koppel takes nights off, but it still does five-part series on misery and chaos in Congo. Letterman's a smart guy, but he spends his time (and his audience's) talking about stupid stuff with stupid celebrities. His smug, easy sardonicism is a better chaser for mindless consumerism than expos鳠from Africa.
I admit I have no more statistical evidence for this theory than the go-young strategists do for theirs. But perhaps Disney—which also canned the discordant Jim Hightower soon after buying ABC—knows what it's doing. Too bad.
SHMOOZE BEFORE NEWS
Letterman's ascent marks another, less-noted trend: the triumph of shmooze and shtick over news and analysis in this post-information age. And not just in late-night TV, where Nightline was always the high-minded exception. News anchors come not as chroniclers of the world's woes but as guests at the family dinner table, with sappy banter that would send Huntley and Brinkley over the brink. Public radio is more and more about chatting and hamming, from Car Talk, Rewind, and the excruciating Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me to endless shmoozy "traffic reports" that fill the place of TV weather reports. We're not bowling alone, we're just listening alone. The airwaves have made conversation another spectator sport, like baseball, sex, and war.

Packaging for organic food products
Client
Self-initiated
description
In my graduation project from the Bachelor's program of Design at School of Design and Crafts (HDK) I attempted to challenge the clichés of graphic design for organic products and designed a packaging concept for a fictional food brand. The project had a special objective which was to explore ways to use the package as carrier for information about the enviromental impact of the packaging itself.
The process included research about packaging design and its effect on the consumer, an investigation of the Swedish market for organic foods, creating and defining a brand, and designing a coherent packaging concept for a product line which communicates the brand's values and appeals to the intended target group.
The final concept incorporates a meeting between traditional and modern values, and has a no-nonsense, honest approach that intends to give a trustworthy impression. Patterns and colors bring the design to life and work together with the typography to inspire a feeling of joy and passion for food. The paper-collage like stylization of the illustrations make them playful without being childish.
The project resulted in prototypes for a muesli package, tea carton and honey jar, as well as a manual that explains the application of the graphic program.

News
South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust,
(SECAmb) has been highly commended in two categories at this year’s
Health Service Journal Efficiency Awards.
The awards, which recognise healthcare efficiency and cost
savings at the same time as maintaining the highest levels of
patient care, were held in London on Tuesday 25 September. This
year there were more than 300 entrants.
SECAmb was highly commended in the Efficiency in Estates
Management category for its Make Ready initiative and in the
Workforce Efficiency category for its Unit Hour Utilisation
initiative.
SECAmb is in the process of rolling out its Make Ready
initiative across its Kent, Sussex and Surrey region. The Make
Ready system offers significant benefits for patients. Specialist
teams are employed to clean, restock and maintain vehicles which
means our ambulance clinicians, who routinely undertaken these
tasks, can spend more time treating patients.
The Unit Hour Utilisation initiative has saved £25m over four
years. Its premise is simple - making sure that the services’
resources match demand. This has been achieved by studying
when the service is most and least required, and then forecasting
future demand. Having this structure means that the Trust is able
to plan staff rotas and distribute resources to accurately reflect
demand.
SECAmb Head of Operational Planning, Rob Mason said: “Ambulance
resources are placed on duty when emergencies are most likely to
happen, with staff positioned so that they are near the patient
before the phone rings. The close alignment of supply to
demand, both by time and location, delivers some of the best
response times in the country, contributing to more lives being
saved.”
SECAmb Director for Estates, Geoff Catling added: “The Make
Ready system is a catalyst to achieving economies of scale and
efficiency. It ensures our vehicles are perfectly re-stocked and
cleaned and that more time is released for front-line clinicians to
spend on patient care. Safety for both patients and staff is
improved.”
“Those of us that attended the awards were very proud to be
there and have the opportunity to celebrate the success of the
Trust, and the hard work which has resulted in this
recognition.”

The following is a brief description of some of the self defense weapons and devices that we offer. For prices and more specific information on specific devices click on “Personal Protection” on the left hand side of our web page and select the specific item you are interested in.
Folding Knives
Security Camera King carries several different folding knives that can be used as self defense weapons. Fend off would be attackers with the flash of a professional folding knife. These knives are constructed of professional grade 420 stainless steel and are designed for easy opening with just one hand. We have a variety of shapes, sizes, colors and clip types.
Locking Cuffs
Locking cuffs aren’t always considered as a self defense weapon, however restraining an individual can be your first line of self defense. Security Camera King offers a variety of metal locking cuffs, including thumb cuffs, handcuffs, and leg cuffs.
Mace Pepper Sprays
The original chemical composition of mace was a 1% solution of phenacyl chloride, a tear gas chemical, suspended in a solution of 2-butanol, propylene glycol, cyclohexene, and dipropylene glycol methyl ether. Since this formulation is not allowed in many states and several countries, it is marketed on a limited basis by the owner of the registered trademark, Mace Security International. Most sprays designed as self defense weapons today and most marketed by Mace are now pepper sprays.
Pepper sprays so called because of their active ingredient, oleoresin capsicum, (also called “OC,” the ingredient that makes hot peppers hot!) cause uncontrollable coughing, choking, temporary blindness, and a burning sensation. These effects are all temporary and do not cause permanent damage. However, nothing says “BACK OFF” better than a one or two second burst of pepper spray. Even most law enforcement agencies and the military use OC pepper sprays as a self defense weapon. Security Camera King carries a full line of Mace brand:
• 10% pepper sprays;
• Pepper spray cartridges;
• Refill kits; and
• Holsters.
We even offer the Mace brand “Triple Action” spray that contains pepper, tear gas, and ultraviolet dye that can help to identify an assailant.
Animal Repellent
Not only can self defense weapons protect you from people attempting to do you harm, but attacks by animals are prevalent too. Just ask the postman, utility meter reader, or package courier. For times when the animal kingdom has you cornered we suggest our Mace brand canine repellent spray or even our Mace brand or Guard Alaska bear sprays.
We also carry an electronic ultrasonic dog repeller. This electronic device operates on a 9 volt battery to produce a sound that humans can’t hear but dogs can. The repeller also has a bright LED strobe light and together they can prevent a dog from advancing up to 40 feet away.
Stun Guns and Tazers
Stun guns are handheld devices that deliver a high voltage, low amperage charge when they come in contact with your assailant.

I’ve been asked if recent events have caused a change in heart about Clemson and the Big 12. First, let me say I was never against Clemson going to the Big 12. What I said was if Clemson fans think going to the Big 12 is a way to get away from a league dominated by one or two schools then the Big 12 was by far the worst choice. Texas has, does and will dominate the Big 12. Don’t expect equal revenue sharing. Don’t expect “fairness”. Don’t expect equal footing and a “one school, one vote” mentality.
Expect Texas to get what they want. Sure, sometimes that may benefit Clemson, but don’t expect that to happen often.
Most of the Big 12 teams want 12 teams and a conference championship game. Not Texas. At least not now. Texas had to be dragged kicking and screaming to invite TCU and West Virginia just to get to 10 teams (after probably being “convinced” by their TV partners).
The Big 12 is a good football conference (but it too has its dogs), a pretty good basketball conference (Kansas, Texas, Baylor) and is typically a good baseball conference. Athletically, it would be an upgrade for Clemson.
A few more dollars wouldn’t hurt Clemson either. But then there’s the games in Ames, Iowa and Manhattan, Kansas and Waco and Lubbock, Texas to consider. Not just for football, but baseball and women’s basketball, for example. The pro-Big 12 crowd says, “We get to go to Austin” and “It’d be great playing Oklahoma!” They leave out the fact that with Texas and Oklahoma come Kansas and Iowa State, for example.
Forget about those non-revenue sports the proponents say, football is king. That’s the point – football pays for all those other sports and the cost of football AND those other sports will escalate when those games are being played on Central Standard Time in Ames, Iowa, or Lawrence, Kansas or Waco, Texas.
You hate nooners? Congrats – your game has just been moved to 11 a.m. Eastern so as not to disturb Texas.
Want to travel to see your team? Don’t plan on jumping in the car for the drive to Atlanta or Raleigh. It’s 1200 miles from Clemson to Lubbock and more than a 1,000 from Clemson to Austin.
Hate having your games on ESPN3? Just wait till you get a load of the Longhorn Network.
I’m not against Clemson to the Big 12 or any other conference as long as that decision is based on the future and what is best for Clemson, not some childish grudge for what supposedly happened 30 years ago.
You think Swofford and the ACC have “mistreated” Clemson? I’ve got news for you – Texas runs circles around North Carolina in the power and influence departments. Just ask Nebraska, Colorado, Missouri and Texas A&M.
And one more thing, be prepared to be considered a “newbie” that doesn’t get equal revenue or an equal vote on conference matters. Be prepared for Texas to get their way.
I’m curious what other fans think – What should Clemson’s move be and why?

Southeast Freshmen Loves to Volunteer
College of Education
Volunteering is something that not all people enjoy. Southeast Missouri State University freshman Kelsey Magee, of Columbia, Ill., thrives on it.
Kelsey, an elementary education major, volunteered in many organizations in high school, and she said she looks forward to becoming involved in more volunteer projects at Southeast.
“In high school, I was a volunteer coach for a sixth grade volleyball team. I really enjoyed being involved in high school, and I hope to be involved in volunteering and other organizations here in Cape Girardeau,” Kelsey said.
Joining the sorority Alpha Xi Delta and the Junior Pan-Hellenic Council has already enhanced Kelsey’s volunteer opportunities at Southeast. Kelsey recently participated in Alpha Xi Delta’s Autism Walk, and she plans on getting more involved in the sorority by running for an office during elections.
Being a freshman at a university can be overwhelming at first, but Kelsey said that joining a sorority has helped her ease her way into college and meet wonderful friends.
“Joining Alpha Xi Delta was probably the best thing I could have done for myself because of the opportunities it presents,” Kelsey said. “I have a larger group of friends, it encourages me to keep my grades up, and it keeps me active with volunteer work.”
Kelsey said that receiving the Regional Achievement Award financially enabled her to join the sorority. The Regional Achievement Award provided Kelsey with in-state tuition plus 10 percent because of her outstanding ACT score and high school grade point average.
“Because of the Regional Achievement Award, I am able to be involved in different organizations which you must pay dues to belong, like Alpha Xi Delta. It has opened many doors for me here at Southeast,” Kelsey said.

Tracking Sub Domain Stats on Main Domain Google Account
OK so we created a subdomain recently,. When this subdomain was built, I gave the developer our main google tracking code (the one that is put on our main domain). When I look into my google analytics account for my main domain I am not seeing any tracking data for this new subdomain. How can I find this? Did I use the wrong google code, if so, is there a way to retrieve this information? When I look at the admin level under tracking info I see that it is tracking subdomains so i assumed that this should work.
Any info would be appreciated.
Thanks
Pat

The Mozza Cookbook
Sometimes it’s the simple things. In this case, it’s a recipe for long-cooked broccoli. Many people hate broccoli. But, I love it. It brings back many fond childhood memories. Many of those memories revolve around a holiday table filled with delicious food cooked with lots of heart and served with loving hands.
The recipe you’ll find in the Mozza Cookbook is a similar version of the dish that I’ve eaten many times. The essentials in my family’s version are fresh broccoli, olive oil, fine sea salt, garlic, the juice of a lemon and a sprinkle of finely ground red pepper flakes. Toss it all in a bowl adding copious amounts of rich olive oil. Then, spread it out flat in a baking dish and cook it slowly in the oven under a low flame. The Mozza version adds onion, chile de arbol and freshly ground black pepper.
…lovely additions all.
The cauliflower gratinate sounds equally rich and delicious. And, it’s on my very short To-Do list. These two recipes might sound simplistic. But, it’s an eye for the simple things done right that speak to real Italian home cooking. That’s what I love about The Mozza Cookbook.

THURSDAY, June 28 (HealthDay News) -- Supporters of the Obama administration's health care reform law said Thursday that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision upholding the landmark legislation protects the health of millions of Americans, but critics claim it does so at the expense of key civil liberties and exacts a high economic toll.
The 5-to-4 ruling "means millions of Americans can look forward to the coverage they need to get healthy and stay healthy," Dr. Jeremy Lazarus, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement.
"This decision protects important improvements, such as ending coverage denials due to preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on insurance, and allowing the 2.5 million young adults up to age 26 who gained coverage under the law to stay on their parents' health insurance policies," Lazarus said.
Already, about 54 million Americans are benefiting from expanded preventive and wellness care coverage, Lazarus noted.
But many of those who oppose the legislation fear the federal government is intruding into the lives of private citizens.
"I'm disappointed that the Court is willing to give the federal government the power to tell you what has to be in your health care plan down to your contraceptives and mammograms," said John Goodman, president and founder of the National Center for Policy Analysis. "That's a great deal of power."
Economically, the Affordable Care Act "is one reason economic recovery has been so anemic," he suggested. Although hours worked across the United States are now what they were before the recession, hiring is not at pre-recession levels, he said, attributing that lag to "Obamacare" insurance requirements.
"The mandates come with a big price tag for employers and employees," Goodman said. The cost of family coverage works out to $6 an hour, he added.
Whether for or against the law, experts voiced relief that a decision was reached.
"We're very relieved and eager to move forward from here now that we have some certainty," said Dr. Glen Stream, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
The law's comprehensive primary-care initiative ensures funding for important health practices related to the "medical home" approach, he said. Preventive services, such as wellness coaching, dietitians and electronic record-keeping programs, are now accessible to many Americans through public and private payers, he noted.
Another benefit, according to Stream, is the provision for primary care work-force training. "Federally qualified community health centers have the capacity to train family physicians, which is critical," he said.
"Now we can work on other meaningful reforms," he said, mentioning liability reform.
Alison Renner Manson, manager of government affairs and policy for the National Coalition on Health Care, predicted that Congress has some hard work ahead. In some ways, the ruling was only the tip of the iceberg, she noted.
"The decision upholds existing law, so we're not looking at major changes," she said. "A lot of decisions on health care need to be made over the next year that will have a larger impact."
For instance, even with the Affordable Care Act in place, as much as one-third of U.S. health spending benefits no one's health, Manson said.
"It's an ongoing problem we have to deal with one way or another," she said. These issues include unnecessary or duplicated tests and services, excessive administrative costs, and instances of fraud and abuse, she explained. "We want to get more for our health-care dollars, but we don't want people to go without services," she said. And for that to happen, consumers, politicians and policy makers will have to work together, her group believes.
Because the court decision upheld the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act under a constitutional tax provision, there could be surprise financial implications, some say.
Karen Ignagni, president and CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), said in a statement that she anticipates financial obstacles as a result of the ruling. AHIP is a Washington, D.C.-based trade association representing the health insurance industry.
"The law expands coverage to millions of Americans, a goal health plans have long supported, but major provisions, such as the premium tax, will have the unintended consequences of raising costs and disrupting coverage unless they are addressed," she noted.
"Health plans will continue to work with policymakers on both sides of the aisle to make coverage more affordable, give families and employers peace of mind, and promote choice and competition," she said.
Figures reviewed by AHIP indicate that the minimum essential health benefits requirement "will result in less affordable coverage for individuals, families and small employers by forcing them to 'buy up' and purchase more coverage than they may want or need," she added.

Oaka Williams, a reserve end and placekicker on one of Tennessee’s most storied championship football teams, died Wednesday at his home in Bluefield, Va. He was 77.
The 1949 graduate of Bluefield High School earned All-State honors before attending West Virginia University and then Tennessee. He hailed from the same hometown and was a teammate of Bob Davis, a three-year starting center for the Vols who went on to a long coaching and administrative career in the UT Athletics Department.
The two Virginians were part of Tennessee’s 1951 consensus national championship team that went undefeated through the regular season and played in the Sugar Bowl.
After his playing days, Williams returned to his hometown and worked for both Reid Belt and Rubber Co., and Wysor Electric. He owned O.H. Williams Electric Co., and Big Oak Swimming Pool and Supply Sales.
He probably was most recognized for his guidance and affection for the youth of the surrounding area. Williams built Harmony Acres swimming pool in 1953 and operated it for 36 years. Since 1994, he was employed by the town of Bluefield maintaining the pool.
As a lay person, his knowledge of mechanics, electrical, swimming pools and building was widely sought by many residents and contractors. Williams was an active and supportive citizen of the Bluefield community and a member of the First Christian Church of Bluefield, W.Va.
Williams is survived by his wife of 56 years, Gail, and children Gary (son) and Tammy of Bluefield, Va., and Valerie (daughter) of Bluefield, Va. He had six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Information was gathered from last Saturday’s edition of the Bluefield Daily Telegraph.

Individual tickets for four Tennessee home football games—UAB (Sept. 13), Northern Illinois (Oct. 4), Wyoming (Nov. 8) and Kentucky (Nov. 29)—were made available early this week for fans to purchase online at UTSports.com.
Tickets for Northern Illinois and Wyoming are $40 each plus shipping and handling. Tickets for UAB and Kentucky are $50 each plus shipping and handling.
“Every year we receive tickets back from some of our visiting opponent allotments,” said Mike Hamilton, men’s athletics director. “We hope that by making these tickets available in the summer, our fans will have more opportunities to make their football plans.”
The athletics department does not expect any visitor returns from Florida, Mississippi State or Alabama. But should those become available, any remaining single tickets can be purchased either online, via phone at (800) 332-VOLS and at the Thompson-Boling Arena ticket office beginning July 21.

Lawyers for the Stow Lake Corp. could not convince a Superior Court judge Tuesday that the company has a legal right to keep managing the Golden Gate Park boathouse, but the saga seems destined to continue.
Oliver Holmes, a lawyer for the longtime boathouse manager, said that his clients will probably appeal a judge’s decision dismissing their lawsuit seeking to throw out a decision awarding the contract to another company.
The company, which has managed the boathouse for about 65 years, has fought to be the long-term leaseholder. Citing a lack of investment, city officials have denied the company’s applications five times since 2006. Company officials complained every time.
Finally, an independent panel convened by the Recreation and Park Department last year recommended awarding Ortega Family Enterprises a 15-year contract at the boathouse, mainly because of its plan for renovations. The Board of Supervisors unanimously ratified the decision.
Stow Lake Corp. lawyers argued that the selection process was corrupt and that the department unfairly favored Ortega.
The lawsuit attracted outsized attention once it was revealed that Rec and Park staff advised Ortega to hire a well-connected lobbying firm.
"I think it was a lack of judgment to suggest a particular firm," Judge Loretta Giorgi said Tuesday. But she noted that the decision was ultimately unrelated to the issues she was presiding over. "There’s no question in my mind that this process was done in a forthright manner," she said.
Giorgi said Stow Lake Corp. lawyers did not have evidence that prove the merits of their case. "This needs to move forward," she said.
The company was supposed to vacate the premises March 22, but it has remained in place because of the litigation.
Another company lawyer, Paul Rosenlund, implied after the hearing that his client won’t be leaving soon. "They’re still tenants and they have holdover tenant rights," Rosenlund said. "Does The City want to risk the liability it would incur by throwing out a business that’s been there for 65 years?"

Imagine. Addiction experts know the end of that story too well — Jack and Bill go on drinking. They’re feeding their addiction today and promising to deal with it tomorrow.
A similar scene is playing out right now on the world stage. Imagine that President Barack Obama is Jack, Greece is Bill, and the fifth of Old Crow is a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund, paid for by the U.S., Germany, France and other European nations.
But, just as Jack didn’t mention to Bill that he borrowed the Old Crow from somebody else (whom he promised to repay), the U.S. must borrow from others to fund today U.S. to Greece via the IMF will be with funds that first must be borrowed from China or somebody else.
As Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla, often says, Washington has a spending addiction and too many officials here depend on the same kind of denial that addicts use to shield themselves from reality. Take away their booze, heroin, sex or whatever, and they scream to high heaven, make all kinds of promises about quitting tomorrow, and otherwise say anything to get another fix. Most Washington politicians react similarly when they are told they must stop spending money the government doesn’t have. Tragically, addicts often have to “hit bottom” before they will get help. If Washington finally hits bottom, it will be a Great Depression or worse.

New Yorker Israel’s WINDFALL is as much the story of a small upstate New York community, Meredith, torn asunder as it is an expose of the massive wind turbines that split the residents. Energy salesmen from an energy outfit in Ireland offered locals money if they would agree to allow them to build the structures on their land. In a town with no zoning, the reps anticipated huge profits. The residents were split, mostly along lines of lifetimers (for) and weekenders and expatriates from New York City (against), culminating in a new slate of candidates for the municipal elections proposed by those opposed to the alternative power source – and Israel generates suspense by following the run-up to the vote.

"The Beards back on twitter.....Lets Rage!!!!!!!!"
With that, Brian Wilson returned to Twitter this week after a long break. Within an hour of initiating @BrianWilson38, he had 4,000 followers, and the number zoomed toward 20,000 by Thursday evening.
While others simply sign up for Twitter, Wilson typically took it to an extreme and visited the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco on Wednesday, toting the World Series trophy.
Wilson's previous venture on Twitter ended abruptly in April 2009 after he implied in tweets that he was partying into the night - the next afternoon, he blew a save opportunity.
It turned into a controversy that prompted Wilson to remove all his posts and write, "WARNING-do not take my twitters seriously, they are made up stories that reflect my humor."
Pretend parade: Some Giants and a group of indefatigable "fans" participated in Giants promotional photo and video shoots Thursday outside the Old Mint building in downtown San Francisco.
The fans, standing on a small set of bleachers, sent up cheers repeatedly for more than four hours as they watched players leaning out of a fake cable car.
Giants on the scene included Buster Posey, Tim Lincecum, Freddy Sanchez, Pat Burrell, Sergio Romo and Cody Ross.

Williamsport, Pa. -- Petaluma hit four home runs, got 12 strikeouts from its pitchers and made no errors Sunday at the Little League World Series.
Yet it lost a heartbreaker 9-6 to Goodlettsville, Tenn., which snapped a 5-5 tie with four runs in the top of the sixth.
Two wild pitches and four passed balls proved too much for the Sonoma County kids to overcome, leaving them 1-1 in the tournament and facing elimination if they lose again. Petaluma now must win two games to get to the final in its bracket.
Petaluma plays Parsippany, N.J., at 1 p.m. PST Monday (ESPN).
In Sunday's loss, the first inning proved to be a struggle for pitcher Danny Marzo and catcher Austin Paretti. Marzo, a left-hander, couldn't find the groove early, and Goodlettsville was able to score two runs on only one hit, plus a number of balls that got past the catcher. Marzo then started hitting his spots, striking out the side with a mix of curveballs and fastballs.
Petaluma answered in the bottom of the first with singles by Porter Smith and Logan Douglas. Bradley Smith, the 6-foot-3 13-year-old who led the team to victory in its first game of the tournament, then hit a laser-beam home run down the left-field line to make it 3-2.
A big play in the second inning allowed Goodlettsville to take a 4-3 lead. After Brock Meyers doubled off the wall, a perfect throw from Logan Douglas and a perfect relay by Porter Slate got the ball to the plate a split second before the runner made contact with Paretti, but the umpire called obstruction, allowing the run to count.
"It was a tough call. It could have (gone) either way, but I was OK with the call," said manager Eric Smith.
Goodlettsville got out of trouble in the bottom half, ending Petaluma's rally with a double play after singles by Quinten Gago and Cole Tomei. Douglas took the mound for Petaluma with two outs in the top of the third and got a crucial out with a runner on second, keeping the score 4-3.
Goodlettsville picked up another unearned run in the top of the fourth with the help of a passed ball and an infield single. Petaluma's Kempton Brandis then led off the bottom half with an opposite-field home run off a fastball, making it 5-4.
"A positive attitude and a will to do your best drives Kempton," said his mother, Rachel Brandis.
Slate opened the bottom of the fifth with a game-tying home run off a pitch that was up and in after falling behind 0-2. It was Slate's 12th home run in his past 23 tournament games. He had only one home run during the regular season.
"For the past five years, Porter has dedicated many hours working outside of practice, and his dream came true," his mother, Heather Slate, said.
In the sixth and final inning, Goodlettsville scored two runs on a double and two on a home run. Tomei got one run back with a two-out homer in the bottom of the sixth, and Petaluma got another runner on, before the Tennessee squad got the last out.
Bradley Smith will pitch Monday. As the cleanup hitter, he is 6-for-7 in the tournament, with two doubles and two home runs.
"We have not lost two straight all year. I am confident the kids will come out and play hard and win tomorrow," Eric Smith said.

The mayor of Sacramento walked out on Cal's basketball team Wednesday night.
Not that Kevin Johnson, a former Golden Bear player, was disgusted by what he saw while he took in the game from courtside as San Diego State scored a 77-57 victory at Haas Pavilion.
As a distinguished point guard in his day, Johnson probably knew what was coming as the No. 14 Aztecs used an 8-0 run to take a 51-42 lead and used a Cal timeout with 11:50 remaining to make his exit.
The Aztecs, however, were just getting started. Explosive, opportunistic and athletic, they outscored the Bears 36-17 in the last 14 minutes of the game to settle things and improve to 9-0 for the first time in school history.
"They're tough. That's a good team," Cal's Harper Kamp said. "This team really tried to get out in transition and speed the game up. That's their advantage because they're so athletic."
In falling to 5-3, Cal never looked more inexperienced. Eighteen turnovers by the Bears, 11 in the second half, enabled the Aztecs to stretch out comfortably from a 28-26 advantage at the break. Freshman guard Gary Franklin was 0-for-4 shooting, missing all three of his three-point attempts, and had three turnovers to conclude a particularly inept night.
Cal coach Mike Montgomery spent most of the game trying to find the right combination of players but the job was made more difficult by his team's poor shooting. The Bears hit on only 7 of 29 shots in the first half and for the game were 0-for-9 from three-point range.
Forward Kawhi Leonard and guard James Rahon did most of the damage for San Diego State. Leonard, considered one of the best players on the West Coast, scored 20 points in displaying NBA-like moves. Rahon added 15 points, 11 coming in the first half. The Bears had no answers for them.
"We are a good team. To come in here and win the way we did I think lets a lot of people know that, because we beat a good team," San Diego State coach Steve Fisher said.
Cal once again got the most it could out of its three experienced players, Jorge Gutierrez, Kamp and Markhuri Sanders-Frison, as they scored 45 of their team's 57 points. Gutierrez had 19, Kamp 18 and Sanders-Frison eight, to go with a game-high 12 rebounds.
"I don't know what you can do," Montgomery said, referring to Leonard in particular. "I guess the theory is that a good player is ultimately going to get it going. I'd like my kids to be bigger, stronger, faster. All you can do is ask them to give their best effort."

Education
"For what purpose should one cultivate wisdom? May you always ask yourself this question.
--Daisaku Ikeda
.jpg)
(Nov. 2000)
Ikeda believes that the task of education is to foster people of character who will contribute to building a just and peaceful world. He is also a firm believer in the importance of empowering young people.
Ikeda has put into practice the philosophy of Soka or "value-creating" education of Soka Gakkai first president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi (1871-1944), a student-centered approach based on a belief in the limitless potential of every individual.
He has founded the Soka education system, with kindergartens in six countries, elementary to graduate level study in Japan and a liberal arts university in the USA.
He has delivered lectures on themes related to peace, Buddhism and the human condition at more than 30 universities and academies worldwide, including Harvard University, the University of Bologna, the University of Havana and Peking University.

National group rarely gets involved in local politics
by Mike Andrew -
SGN Staff Writer
In a surprise move, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) announced on February 28 that it was endorsing Washington state Sen. Ed Murray for mayor of Seattle.
'This is a good day for us,' Murray campaign consultant Sandeep Kaushik told SGN by phone. 'This is a really big deal!'
HRC, which typically does not get involved in local races, has 1.5 million members nationally and some 65,000 in Washington state.
'Ed as an individual is so unique,' Lacey All, a member of HRC's national board of directors, told SGN. 'He has such a long history of changing politics, not just here [in Washington] but nationally. We thought it was important to acknowledge that work.'
'It's boots on the ground, volunteers,' Kaushik said, explaining the significance of HRC support. Kaushik added that once Murray is legally able to begin fundraising again - which he is prohibited from doing while the legislature is in session - it may be a financial base as well.
'I suspect that as we get into springtime, many of our members will want to get involved,' All said. 'The best is still ahead!'
'EXCEPTIONAL DEDICATION'
In its endorsement statement, HRC was effusive in its praise for Murray.
'State Senator Ed Murray has changed the national landscape for LGBT equality by demonstrating exceptional dedication over his more than 15 years in public office in fighting for equality for all Washingtonians,' HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement.
'He has shown unwavering commitment to taking on - and winning - the tough fights that are paramount to our community, including successfully building bipartisan support for Washington state's historic marriage equality legislation in 2012 and then playing a major leadership role in the successful effort to approve Referendum 74, which upheld that law.
'It is rare for us to get involved in a local race, but we know Ed Murray as a national leader on LGBT issues, and that is why we endorse him with great enthusiasm.'
Griffin added that Murray's leadership extended far beyond the arena of civil rights.
'Senator Murray is a champion for Seattle and time and again has demonstrated his leadership skills in making progress on difficult issues like improving education, strengthening environmental protections, funding critical transit and transportation improvements, and writing budgets in tough economic times that still protect the poor and vulnerable,' Griffin said.
MURRAY PRAISES HRC
For his part, Murray said he was 'honored' to get HRC's endorsement.
'I know first-hand from our recent R-74 marriage equality victory how active and engaged HRC members are, and I believe their support will make a huge difference in powering my campaign to victory in August and November,' he said.
In addition to HRC, the LGBT Victory Fund and ERW have endorsed Murray's campaign. The only other local race HRC has gotten involved in this year is Lesbian Christine Quinn's campaign for mayor of New York City.

This book will show you how being aware of your breathing can have a profound impact on your physical and emotional health in a most positive way. Whether you are interested in stress reduction, easing a chronic breathing problem, or exploring the more spiritual aspects of breathing practice, this illustrated guide will provide you with practical, simple exercises to calm, energize, and generally enhance your sense of well-being. The author, Dennis Lewis, also shows how becoming more conscious of your breathing can reveal a lot about your self-image and help you deal more effectively with difficult emotions and situations.
"This is by far the most compelling and complete book on breathing I've ever read. It is 'must' reading for everyone who is interested in optimal health."—Christiane Northrup, M.D., author of Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom
"Lewis teaches us how to assess our breathing and provides practical tools to help us learn to breathe better and create a healthier balance in our everyday lives. He makes clear that how we breathe reflects who we are and the manner in which we express ourselves—physically, emotionally, and spiritually. This book is a wonderful resource for anyone who wishes to improve his or her health and vitality through the breath."—Len Saputo, M.D., coeditor of Boosting Immunity
"Dennis Lewis has a deep understanding of the central importance of breathing, in both its physical and spiritual dimensions—as the breath of life and the breath of the spirit. This book is a practical, inspiring guide to opening yourself to the larger energies of life through the medium of the breath. Highly recommended!"—John Welwood, author of Toward a Psychology of Awakening

The reader will not only understand through Dennis's inspired writing, but get to experience through numerous excellent, practical exercises how conscious and authentic breathing is the gateway to enhanced health and vitality."—Meg Jordan, Ph.D., author of The Fitness Instinct and founder and editor of American Fitness
"It is extremely difficult to write well and truly about the healing role of breathing both in our everyday life and on the way to great self-knowledge. Dennis Lewis succeeds through a rare combination of clear-headed, practical thought and spiritual sensitivity."—Jacob Needleman, author of The American Soul
"Dennis Lewis is a colleague, teacher, author, poet, and dedicated student of the breath and breathing. Free Your Breath, Free Your Life is not just a good book—it is a great book. It is required reading for all my students attending the Optimal Breathing School. It should be required reading for everyone."—Michael Grant White, Executive Director, Breathing.com
"This is a truly inspiring and informative book. It is a master breath-worker's book for those who wish to attain breath, and thus self-mastery."—Dr. Joy Manne, author of Soul Therapy, editor of The Healing Breath: A Journal of Breathwork Practice, Psychology, and Spirituality

How is pain diagnosed?
There are no tests to determine whether or not a person is in pain. Doctors may ask a series of questions to try to characterize and locate the pain to determine its cause and find a treatment. Doctors may also move the limbs or touch various spots on the body to try to figure out the source of the pain.
- Piedmont Heart Institute answered:
There is no way to tell how much pain a person has. No test can measure the intensity of pain, no imaging device can show pain, and no instrument can locate pain precisely. Sometimes, as in cases of headaches, physicians find that the best aid to diagnosis is patients own description of the type, duration, and location of pain. Defining pain as sharp or dull, constant or intermittent, and burning or aching may give the best clues to the cause of pain. These descriptions are part of what is called the pain history, taken by the physician during the preliminary examination of a patient with pain.
Physicians, however, do have a number of technologies that they use to find the cause of pain. Primarily, these technologies muscles. The first set gives the patient a mild shock that stimulates the nerve that runs to that muscle. The second set (MRI), provides physicians with pictures of the body's structures and tissues. MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to differentiate between healthy and diseased tissue. A neurological examination enables a physician to test movement, reflexes, sensation, balance, and coordination. X-rays produce pictures of the body's structures, such as bones and joints.
This answer is based on source information from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
During a physical examination, a doctor will inspect the area of pain, looking for visual signs of causes, such as trauma and injury. Depending on the location, the doctor may test joints and muscles for strength and range of motion.
- Blood and urine tests: Blood and urine tests can help diagnose diseases that may be causing pain. They can identify abnormal amounts of hormones, enzymes, or other body chemicals that may indicate disease.
- Computed tomography (CT) scan: Computed tomography (CT) scan is an x-ray that uses computer technology and can be enhanced with the injection of a contrast dye into a vein. CT scans allow for multiple X-rays to be taken from different angles around the body where the pain is located to create a three-dimensional image of internal body structures. CT is used to show abnormalities in bones and soft tissue. CT scan can be used for individuals who are unable to tolerate MRI.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests use a powerful magnet to produce images on a computer screen and film.. Some individuals may have to be sedated using a mild sedative such as alprazolam (Xanax®) or lorazepam (Ativan®). If the individual is sedated, transportation should be organized using a family member or friend.
- Nerve conduction studies (NCS): Nerve conduction studies (NCS) evaluate muscle or nerve damage. These tests function by measuring the speed of electrical impulses through the nerves.
- X-ray: X-rays are low doses of radiation that create an image of a body part, organ, or bodily system on film paper or fluorescent screens. X-rays show the alignment of the spine and may reveal degenerative joint disease, fracture, or tumor.

How can I stay physically active as I get older?
- Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics answered:
Older adults should still engage in some form of enjoyable physical activity. Here are just a few ways to get the exercise your body needs:
- Walk around the block or around the mall. Invite a friend for companionship and motivation. Mall walking is safe, especially in bad weather.
- Do some gardening without electric tools.
- Go swimming or try aqua exercises. These are great activities, especially if you're not steady on your feet.
- If you golf, get a caddy or pull-cart and walk the course.
- Go dancing. Even a moderate two-step is good exercise and a great social activity.
- Take a class in Tai Chi, a series of slow, controlled movements.
- Keep your arms strong by lifting "weights" like canned foods, bean bags or even one- to five-pound hand or ankle weights.
- Include stretching activities that increase the range of motion in your ankles, knees, hips, neck and back.
- National Academy of Sports Medicine answered:
The common recommendation has been that adults obtain at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. Remember that does not have to come in long bouts. Exercises sessions can be done in short 8-10 minute bouts..
During the evening hours, instead of watching TV from the couch, do sit-ups and push-ups during commercial breaks. During the show, do lunges and squats to work the legs. If you do this through 2 TV shows you will be getting a good workout.
- Mark Dickey answered:
I strongly recommend the NASM OPT level-stability and muscle endurance & core strengthening program, about 4 to 6 weeks. You will want to ensure that you can demonstrate and have the strength and flexibility to maintain a good and healthy posture. The stability and muscle endurance level will allow the connective tissues to be strengthened and in condition to safely move into your resistance/weight lifting strength training cycle/phase.
You can also recycle into one to two weeks stabilization and endurance phase periodically during the course of a year as a recovery or break from the strength training and to recondition your connective tissues.

Vanishing Twin Syndrome
If you're taking fertility treatments to help you get pregnant, there's a higher chance that you could become pregnant with twins or multiples. Not all twin or multiple pregnancies end with all the babies reaching full term. Sometimes one of the fetuses disappears from the womb in a process that has been called the Vanishing Twin Syndrome.
Identifying Vanishing Twin Syndrome
In the days before ultrasounds and before the syndrome was officially recognized, VTS was identified by an examination of the placenta after delivery. If the fetus isn't completely reabsorbed then it can be flattened by its growing sibling(s) into a state that's known as fetus papyraceus where the fetus looks like a piece of parchment paper. Sometimes limbs and developmental features are visible depending on the gestational age of the fetus.
Nowadays ultrasounds allow a pregnant woman to see her developing babies as early as six to seven weeks gestation. She is told she is having twins or multiples at the early ultrasound. During a standard follow-up visit the doctor detects only one heartbeat with the Doppler. A second ultrasound is arranged to confirm that one fetus died. Some medical statistics suggest that VTS is very common with it happening in as many as 30 percent of multi-fetal pregnancies. It also tends to happen in women over 30.
The Cause
There is no known cause. There is nothing a mother can do to prevent this from happening just as there is nothing a healthy woman can do to prevent the miscarriage of a singleton. Sometimes an examination of the placenta shows placental or chromosomal abnormalities. Sometimes improper cord implantation is considered the cause.
Effects for Mother and Surviving Babies
First trimester vanishing fetuses don't usually cause any health problems for the mother or the surviving fetus. Often the deceased fetus will be reabsorbed into the placental tissue and amniotic fluid. There are often no symptoms typically associated with a miscarriage.
If the gestational time is a little later in the first trimester, then the deceased fetus may get compressed by its sibling(s) in a condition called fetus compressus. Or the fetus could get completely flattened and looks like a piece of parchment paper in a condition called fetus papyraceous. The pregnancy can continue as normal and the mother delivers a healthy baby (or two in the case of multiples).
There are more complications if this happens in the second or third trimester. Second or third trimester VTS is not as common, but can cause infection, pre-term labor or hemorrhaging. Careful medical monitoring and treatment is required and sometimes later Vanishing Twin Syndrome can end in the death of all babies.
Sometimes later term VTS results in remnants of the deceased fetus being found in the survivor in the form of a tertoma tumor containing tissue fragments, teeth, hair or bone. VTS after 20 weeks can increase the risk of the survivor having cerebral palsy.
Vanishing Twin Syndrome can be difficult emotionally for the mother whether it happens early in the pregnancy or later. Even if the other child or children survive, mothers (and fathers) need to understand and accept that it's okay to grieve the death of lost baby while still being happy about the surviving baby.

Vermont Senior Living
They don’t call Vermont the Green Mountain State for nothing. One of the most beautiful states in the northeast, senior living in Vermont has a lot to offer anyone looking for retirement options. Boasting the smallest population of any state east of the Mississippi, Vermont is routinely ranked among the top states for both health and safety with its low crime rates. Agriculture is an economic mainstay, especially dairy farming, with the production of milk, cheese, butter, ice cream and additional artisanal foods shipped throughout New England. Famous for its maple syrup, Vermont is also home to many wineries and microbreweries, as well as state parks, historic sites, and museums.
Senior citizens comprise 15% of Vermont’s population, well over the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau’s national average of 13.3%. With so many facilities to serve this growing demographic, Vermont senior living options are widely available.
Vermont Assisted Living Costs
According to Genworth Data, the average annual cost of a private one-bedroom assisted living facility in Vermont is $46,800. Prices may vary depending on location and care necessities.

Retirement in Vermont
While Vermont is considered one of the most picturesque states for retirement, for those of you looking to make your nest egg last for years and years, you might just want to take an actual photo and keep on driving. That beautiful view comes with one steep price tag. Compared to the rest of the country, Vermont's cost of living is 16.70% higher than the U.S. average.
Adding to its high cost of living, according to Kiplinger.com, Vermont is not what you would consider very tax-friendly. In fact, it could be considered one of the most “tax-hostile” states in the US, especially for seniors.
Did you know that...?
- Vermont taxes most retirement income, including Social Security income *
- Vermont’s property taxes are among the ten highest in the U.S., according to the Tax Foundation.
- There is a property-tax exemption for veterans. The first $10,000 (may be increased up to $40,000 by a vote of the town) of appraisal value of the residence of a qualifying veteran, his or her surviving spouse or child may be exempt.*
- Vermont has no inheritance tax, but it does have an estate tax if property exceeds $2.75 million
Best Cities for Retirement in Vermont
Montpelier is the capital and adjacent to the mountains, making it a great community for those active senior types. Not too far away from the capital, Burlington is a lively college town on Lake Champlain that is also near the Green Mountains. Being so close to that clean mountain air gives this little city the great distinction of having the best air-quality measures in the nation. It’s also quite popular with the tourists, attracting 3 million visitors a year.
If you’re looking for something a little quieter than Burlington, there really is no shortage of senior community possibilities in Vermont. Brattleboro, Bennington and Middlebury both offer great options for retirement activities with reasonable housing costs.
Local Health Care
There are 15 hospitals and medical centers in Vermont. The Fletcher Allen Health Care Center is the number one hospital that meets the state’s strong performance standards.

Activities for Seniors
No matter where you go in Vermont, you’ll bound to find a variety of things to do. Every major town offers excellent dining, diverse cultural events, and shopping opportunities. For those looking for a little more action, Vermont senior living offers a ton of activities like skiing, snowboarding, bird-watching, and fishing in the Green Mountains.
Lake Champlainis also a popular resort town, attracting thousands of visitors every year. Often called the sixth Great Lake, it stretches for more than 120 miles between Vermont, New York, and Quebec. The lake, surrounded by the rugged Adirondack Mountains and beautiful Green Mountains, is the place to experience the state’s many outdoor festivals, historic events, and everything from water sports like swimming and skiing to fishing, hiking, and mountain biking.
Local Weather
Just as extreme as its cost of living, Vermont’s climate is not for the faint of heart. Although summers are pleasantly mild, the winters are brutally cold with frequent snowstorms. And that’s just the way the locals and visitors prefer it as a nice fluffy snow storm makes for some killer skiing! Check out Vermont’s current temperatures!

One of my favorite television shows, Seinfeld, was not only funny, but it also perfectly discussed the New York City experience. If you have ever lived in New York City you are bound to have come across one of the quirks of the City that was memorialized on the sitcom.
For example, my wife and I once received a ride back from Long Island after a formal affair from a friend of a friend. The ride took about an hour and a half and this person dropped us off one avenue (about 3 city blocks) away from where we lived because he didn't want to have to drive around the avenue and a couple of blocks. It was also raining and my wife was wearing a dress and I a suit and we were both carrying an overnight bag. It was reminiscent of the Seinfeld episode where Elaine went skiing with her friend and her friend didn't want to drop Elaine off in front of her apartment building because the friend would have had to drive around the block.
Seinfeld comes into play in Anthony Weiner's social media scandal because there is an episode where George decides that he should do the opposite of everything he has done his entire life in order to become a success. To avoid or respond to a social media crisis or scandal act in the exact opposite manner that Weiner did. These are some examples in no particular order of how not to act like a Weiner:
1) Don't take naked or inappropriate photographs of yourself with a smart phone or a camera and then upload them online. Instead, if you enjoy looking at yourself naked stand in front of a mirror.
2) Don't have sexually charged conversations online with others and/or send them inappropriate photographs of yourself. Instead, listen to Avenue Q and "The Internet is for Porn" song.
3) Don't wait days to talk with an attorney once your actions have become public. Instead, hire an attorney immediately and be truthful with your legal counsel.
4) Don't falsely claim that a crime has been committed to explain an errant social media post. Once Weiner refused to file a police report it was evident he was lying. Instead, be truthful about the matter. If your attorney believes a crime may be involved due to the online behavior do not go on the record with an explanation because that may be utilized against you at a later date.
5) Don't hold multiple press conferences and act obnoxious and indignant towards the media. Instead, treat the media with courtesy.
6) Don't lie to your political staff. Many congressional staffers work long hours for years with little compensation because they believe in the causes that the politician champions. Instead, be honest with your staff or do not go on the record with them if your attorney advises against discussing the matter.
7) Don't lie to your constituents, colleagues, and friends. The cover up is almost always worse than the initial activity and digital footprints will most likely expose the truth. Instead, if your attorney advises that there is no legal liability involved honestly explain what happened even if it is embarrassing. The American public is extremely understanding and is willing to forgive their politicians, athletes, entertainers, and heroes. If your attorney advises against discussing the matter publicly refuse to answer questions regarding the matter until your lawyer advises otherwise.
8) Don't drag out the situation. If there appears to be no legal liability apologize immediately. Delaying the inevitable apology will only further fuel the media frenzy and create more anger. Don't follow Tiger Woods' social media scandal playbook.
9) Apologize, apologize, and apologize. When you thought you have apologized enough apologize some more. Show contrition and humility. You need to demonstrate remorse for all the harm you have caused.
10) During a resignation do not pretend you are General Douglas MacArthur giving his "I Shall Return" speech. Instead resign with grace and humility. Weiner's resignation speech sounded more like a political stump speech than a resignation. Weiner should have shown more contrition. For example, during his resignation speech he stated, "most importantly my wife and I can continue to heal from the damage I have caused" and that "I will be looking for other ways to contribute my talents".
In general, the public does not care how Weiner will heal or be able to contribute his talents. He has been over-exposed (no pun intended) and people are sick and tired of looking at him and listening to his untruthful statements. New York may have to spend more than a million dollars to hold a special election to fill his former congressional seat so why didn't Weiner apologize to all of the taxpayers who will now have to foot the bill for his reckless behavior?
Weiner's short-term economic situation may be difficult; however, his long-term economic prospects may be rosy. If he stays out of the spotlight for a period of time, demonstrates that he has learned his lesson, shows contrition, and makes penance he may be able to make a comeback. I think it may take years before he may be able to make a political comeback; however, a professional comeback as a political analyst or a lobbyist may be around the corner.
Weiner may want to utilize social media to launch his professional comeback when the time is right. However, he should stay away from social media until he is able to utilize the medium without sending out inappropriate material. If Elliot Spitzer is able to make a comeback after only a few years Weiner should be able to do so also.

You may not have time for regular make out sessions between work, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning and laundry, but remember how good it felt when you did have endless kissing time? Recreate that romantic feeling by starting a make out session with your man. Instead of turning on the TV after dinner, turn him on – it will be a lot more fun for both of you. Wrap your arms around him or sidle up to him on the couch and start kissing. He'll be pleasantly surprised, and we're willing to bet the night will be a good one.
Surprise your guy one night by cooking a romantic dinner just for him. Make his favorite meal or try to recreate a restaurant meal he recently raved over, pick up a bottle of wine, light some candles and dress up for the occasion. Right before he gets home, slip into the dress that drives him wild. Between the tantalizing aroma of whatever you have in the oven, the romantic atmosphere and the outfit you're wearing, your man will be like putty in your hands. Not to mention how great he'll feel knowing you went to such lengths to show your love. It's easy to let everyday life push romance out of the picture, but it can be easier than you think to bring it back.
When was the last time you sent your man a text about something sexy? Chances are most messages revolve around when he's going to be home, what he wants to for dinner and whether or not he's going to have time to take a look at that leak under the sink – not exactly the stuff in romance novels. Inject some sex appeal into your texts this week by doing some digital flirting. Tell him how great he looked when he left for work or how you can't wait for him to get home later. Think back to some of the things you used to tell him on a regular basis but that have now fallen to the wayside. A little text flirting can go a long way when it comes to creating a spark.
Like text flirting, sending a few short but suggestive emails can do a lot to bring back the romance in your relationship. Seducing him via email may seem impersonal but it's actually a great way to create heat and spice things up between you. All you need to do is use your imagination – share a fantasy, tell him about all of the things you want to do to him when he gets home – you get the idea. Write in a way that feels comfortable to you and that you know will turn him on and get him going. Your emails don't have to be long – just intriguing enough to make him want to leave work early to get home for some sexy fun with his wife!

PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE: CAREER SERVICES AT SHEPHERD
Most students are primarily concerned with getting through school and graduating on time. However, it is never too soon to start planning for the future and what lies beyond commencement day. Accordingly, Career Services is an excellent resource for students to take advantage of right here on campus.
"Students should visit the center as early as their first year to help with the career planning process because it begins when you start college," said Betsy Sheets, director of Career Services.
Career Services provides multiple tools to help aid students with their future such as writing and developing resumes and cover letters, job searching, career fairs, internships, co-ops, interview tips, and assistance with the graduate school application process said Sheets.
A Strong Resume
Developing a strong resume is key in a student's success said Sheets. In addition, it can be tailored to specifically fit the student's goals and career aspirations. "If they know exactly what job they're seeking, then we gear their resume exactly to that particular job," Sheets said. She also provides a worksheet to begin the process of thinking about what the student has done during his or her college career that could be added to a resume. Once this is completed, a professional resume is formatted. While Sheets prefers to meet in person because the student gets more out of a one-on-one appointment, it is also possible to work via e-mail on such things as resume critiques.
Internship Opportunities
Taking advantage of internship opportunities can also be beneficial. "Internships are a vital way to gain experience and network with others so that you can make connections with others when you complete your college career. Students who don't take advantage of this often struggle when they graduate because they don't have any experience and information on their resume," said Sheets.
Career Fairs
She also strongly recommends that students attend one of the numerous career fairs that are offered throughout the year to assist in finding the right job.
The Shepherd University CareerFest, which is held in the fall, is an event where students have the option of dressing casually to gain experience and exposure at a job fair or dressing professionally when seriously seeking a job. "We don't promote that as a professional type of job fair because a lot of students want to get a taste of what a job fair is like, so they want to go from class to the fair and don't want to dress professionally," said Sheets. Seventeen employers were on site for the fair in October. Sheets also said that the fair is a great way for students to learn about volunteer opportunities, internships, and co-ops.
Another popular event is the Cumberland Valley Consortium teacher fair hosted in the fall at Gettysburg College. "This past October, when Shepherd visited the fair, we had the highest number of students to attend, which was great because our students had the farthest distance to commute there," said Sheets.
There is also the Health and Human Services Fair that held in November. This fair is focused toward the nursing department. Local employers as well as those from the D.C. and Northern Virginia area attend to recruit new employees.
Other fairs and events that Career Services offers include the CVC Job and Intern Fair held in February, a teacher recruitment day for education majors who are getting ready to graduate in March, and a virtual job fair held online from May to the end of July.
Online Tools
Students who are feeling the pressure of choosing a major and a minor should take advantage of FOCUS, which operates as an online interest assessment tool for students who don't know where they want their career to go. It helps students become aware of their skills and interests and matches them with appropriate career options. While some students often want to remain an undecided major for a while to complete their general studies requirements, it typically narrows things down for their future decisions, Sheets said. Taking the time to do this can often prove to be extremely beneficial when students enter the workforce as well. "We find that those who can focus on the interests they have end up enjoying their jobs and the work that they're doing," said Sheets.
Interviewing Techniques
The interviewing process also plays a key role in landing the career a student wants. "Being well-prepared for an interview comes across as soon as you meet the interviewer," said Sheets. She feels that body language, eye contact, and appropriate posture are extremely important. One thing that can help is to practice. "Everyone gets nervous, at least to some extent, with an interview so practicing is very important," said Sheets, who has a plethora of handouts and tidbits of information regarding things students should and should not do during interviews. She can also do mock interviews and provide videotapes that students can sign out and take home. In addition, specific question that are typically asked by employers and questions that students should be asking the interviewer are available.
Students who are approaching graduation also have a few things to consider that career services can assist with. According to the "Game Plan for Graduation," a handout available from Sheets, seniors should decide what the time frame of their job search is going to be or when they want to obtain the job. They also need to think about where they plan on living, what jobs are available in that area, the salary they are looking for, and what jobs are available.
Professors Are Resources
Sheets also stresses the importance of students utilizing their professors. "Use your faculty members as a resource because not only do they teach in the field but a lot of them have also worked in the field that they are teaching in, so they have great networks with other employers or colleagues that can be helpful." Another word of advice she offers is to not wait until the last minute to obtain letters of recommendation because students may have difficulty doing so once they graduate.
Workshops
In addition, students should be aware of the various workshops that are offered in areas including resume writing, interview skills, correspondence, and networking. To take part, students need to call Career Services or send an e-mail. If a student doesn't want to attend a workshop, an individual appointment can be made as well Sheets said.
Help for Alumni
If you're one of those students who discovered after graduation that putting off thinking about your future career perhaps wasn't such a good idea, help is still available. "I see a lot of alumni shortly after they graduate needing assistance," said Sheets, who also noted that all services are open to both current students and alumni as well.
Career Services is located on the ground floor of Gardiner Hall. For additional information, call 304-876-5122, e-mail esheets@shepherd.edu, or log online to.

The members of this clique are best known for being in charge. You'll see their faces on Xeroxed fliers all over campus come election time. But unlike a lot of kids in this group, Creon didn't start out with political aspirations. He actually tried to avoid taking the throne, but inevitably he was sucked in to the world of politics, where the power swiftly went to his head.
Widely known as "that-dude-who-killed-his-dad-and-slept-with-his-mom," Oedipus is one of the most famous kings of Thebes. Oedipus was given the throne of Thebes and the hand of Queen Jocasta by Creon after Oedipus saved the city from the man-eating Sphinx. This turned out to be a major disaster, though, because unbeknownst to anybody, Oedipus was Jocasta's son and had unknowingly killed the old king of Thebes, Laius, on the road. Oops.
Agamemnon, King of Mycenae, was one of the biggest, most powerful dudes in Greece. When his brother's wife, Helen, ran off with Paris of Troy, Agamemnon was a shoe-in for five star general to lead the Greeks against Troy. Though there were a ton of Greek kings who rounded up their troops and sailed to Troy, Agamemnon was by far the kingliest.
Theseus was a big deal hero and King of Athens. His biggest claim to fame was braving the Labyrinth of Crete where he slew the man-eating Minotaur, a monster with the body of a man and the head of a bull. Before that, he kicked the butts of six unruly bandits, bringing law and order to the land around Athens. He also got in couple major disagreements with our buddy Creon.
Here he is. The biggest, baddest king of all: Zeus, king of the gods. All the other puny mortal rulers in this clique look up to this guy, who is basically in charge of everything in the universe. Is it just us, or is that just way too much responsibility?

Auden was writing his poems during a time when all the cool poets were writing in free verse. These poets wanted to break poetry apart, make it less stuffy, more free and fresh.
But not Auden. This dude loved him some poetic forms. In fact, he's pretty much the master. Even while the other guys hated rhymes and all that formal poetry stuff, Auden stuck with them, and got really, really good at writing in forms. Much of the power of "Funeral Blues" lies in its repetitive, heavy rhymes, and its play on the elegy form.

The EPA has pursued an aggressive regulatory agenda, creating barriers for job creation, future investment and expanded operations by placing burdensome and costly rules on manufacturers.
Coal-fired power plants are the latest facilities to face EPA’s most recent round of regulations. Last week, one of the largest electricity providers, the American Electric Power Company announced that they will have to shutter five plants to comply with these absurd mandates.
Increasing the cost of energy and killing jobs won’t stimulate the economy or help reduce unemployment.
An editorial in today’s Wall Street Journal cuts right to the chase:.
The Journal concludes that the EPA is imposing “willful damage” and “the least Congress can do is force the EPA to delay the final rule…though a better option would be to junk it.”

How to get the best relocation deal for your company.
With the growing economy, U.S. companies are expanding across the map—and thousands of employees are moving along with them. The number of corporate moves is almost the same as personal moves, according to the American Moving and Storage Association (AMSA). In 1998, 42 percent of household goods moves reported were classified as corporate employee relocations, compared to 43 percent as personal moves. The rest were classified as government or military moves. During 1998, the number of reported employee relocations reached nearly 299,000, up from 279,526 in 1990.
This means HR staffers and managers are overseeing a rising number of employee moves each year. And in a great many cases, their companies are contracting one or more van lines to conduct those moves.
There are several issues to consider when negotiating a relocation contract with a household goods (HHG) carrier. Here’s a rundown of the main decisions to be hashed out when working up a relocation contract, some suggestions on negotiation and a few pointers on what to look for in a HHG carrier.
Keep it Personal
The first advice is to meet face-to-face with a representative of the prospective HHG carrier to promote the most effective, direct communications possible. Allow the carrier to see your facility and to get a feel for your business and company culture. Visiting your facility and meeting your staff will give the carrier a better feel for your business, the personalities in your administration and the standards you will expect. On the same note, plan to visit the van line agent’s facilities and meet the staff. A tour of the offices and warehouses will give you the opportunity to ask questions and talk to employees you meet during the tour, which is a good way to gain insight into the company’s approach to doing business and its attitude toward quality and customer service.
“An HR manager should not make any decisions about a relocation contract without a minimum of two personal meetings with the carrier representative,” states Karl Rau, assistant vice president of contract administration at Atlas Van Lines in Evansville, Ind. “There are details and pricing decisions that require careful consideration. It takes both parties working closely together to determine needs and [to] develop a plan that’s going to create an optimum partnership between the company and the carrier.”
The van line’s information and communications system is an important factor in maintaining good relations. Find out if the carrier can be reached day or night, how that can be done and the name of your contact. If your department relies heavily on e-mail and the Internet, ask about the van line’s e-mail system and if an intranet might provide a link for your company.
“The van line’s communication and information systems are really important when you look at their overall capabilities and how you’re going to stay in touch with them on a day-to-day basis,” stresses Sally Coffin, corporate carrier manager for Intel Corp. in Chandler, Ariz. “For Intel, this factor can carry just as much weight as several other benchmarks that we look for in a household goods carrier.”
Doing the Research
The first order of business is to determine your employee relocation needs for the next year or two as closely as possible. Also, the van line representative will ask whether you plan to transfer employees only within the continental United States, or if moves are anticipated to Canada, Alaska or any other global location? Other questions you need to be prepared to answer are:
Is your typical relocation permanent or temporary?
Will any of your employees require storage for their household goods?
Will they need to have automobiles or pets transported?
Do you anticipate relocating an entire office or division within the next year?
Based on your answers, the carrier representative should first assess whether the van line has a network of trusted, quality moving agents and backup facilities available to handle the volume and locations of the moves you anticipate, especially during the busiest summer months. If the carrier and its network of partners cannot handle the volume of moves you anticipate, you may have to begin looking at another carrier or consider contracting more than one van line to get the job done.
Ask the agency representative questions about fellow agents and agents used outside the booking agent’s geographic area. You should be concerned with the average frequency and severity of damage claims reported on their moves, who directs their operations, the quality of their warehouse facilities and whether the agents who will conduct these moves are experienced in corporate relocations. Ask for names of other companies the agent has served and use those companies as references on the van line’s work, if possible.
“Even though we think of household goods moving as a pretty basic service, moving companies and their way of doing business can differ greatly,” notes Robert Brizuela, director of relocation at Charles Schwab & Co. in San Francisco. “Be careful to choose a carrier that’s a good match for your company’s culture and for its relocation needs.”
The Tariff
The tariff is the schedule of rules, rates and charges for the transportation industry set by the Household Goods Carrier’s Bureau Rate Committee, a division of AMSA. Because it is a complex system and subject to change, dealing with the tariff is probably the most daunting issue facing HR people when working on a relocation contract. But taking a simplified approach can help, Rau says. á
“It’s not a good idea for relocation administrators to get caught up in the tariff because of its complex nature,” Rau explains. “The better way to determine what moving charges will be is to start at the other end. Find out what services the majority of employee moves will require and the company will cover, then work with the carrier to determine a cost estimate based on those items.”
Taking this approach at the front end will accomplish another essential task: determining which moving services the company will authorize for the average move and which it will not. Typical authorized services would include packing, loading and unloading for the primary residence and warehousing costs when household goods must be stored. Services not typically authorized may include the packing of goods in a vacation home, the transport of an automobile or the transport of large exercise equipment.
The other tariff-related decision to clarify is whether to freeze tariff rates for the term of the contract or to go with the rates that are in effect when each move occurs. Just as with interest rates on a bank loan, freezing the tariff precludes the company from paying higher rates if the moving service raises those rates during the course of the contract. On the other hand, freezing will also prevent the company from benefiting from any rate reductions should they occur.
The Corporate Discount
With few exceptions, companies that contract with a carrier for a pre-determined number of employee moves will receive a discount on tariff rates. On average, corporate discounts fall between 48 percent and 58 percent and may be based on different factors, such as the number of moves anticipated and whether or not the company has chosen to freeze its tariff rate. Companies may expect a somewhat less generous discount if they opt to freeze tariff rates for the duration of the contract.
While relocation administrators may find that they can negotiate a deep discount with some carriers, it’s important to remember that cheapest isn’t always best. If the carrier agrees to an extremely high discount, the quality of employee moves may suffer because there’s simply not enough money left for the mover to provide top-notch services.
“There’s a definite correlation between price and service, and I’ve learned through the years that the deeper the discount goes, the more likely you are to find quality issues,” states Lynn Davis, director of global relocation services at Gap Inc., a company now initiating more than 1,200 moves per year.
Brizuela adds, “Five years ago, pricing and discounts were the issues we looked at first in our relocation contracts, but we found we did not get the best results that way,” he says. “Cost is still an important issue, but now we’re more concerned with service, the way the carrier takes care of our employees and how claims are handled.”
Terms of Pricing and the Discount
Once an agreement on the discount level is reached, the corporate discount can be applied in a number of billing situations. Here are some of the pricing options available through most van lines:
Bottom-line discount pricing. This option means the company is charged only for services, labor and materials that are actually provided for each employee move, less the agreed-upon discount. It is the most common pricing method employed in corporate relocation contracts. Remember that your corporate discount will not apply to work performed by third-party companies such as household appliance technicians and real estate agents. Also, cost for the storage of household goods is usually addressed separately.
Single-factor pricing. This gives an all-inclusive rate for a menu of services and is calculated according to the weight and distance of each employee move. Single-factor rate pricing is easier to understand than the bottom-line discount method, but it doesn’t give an accurate reflection of actual services provided. This method can be cost-effective in a move that requires most or all of the services included in the package but may not be as cost-effective for employee moves that don’t require some of the services included in the single factor rate. The corporate discount your company receives will be built into the single-factor billing rate.
Performance-based pricing. This ties the corporate discount into the customer’s satisfaction level with services provided by the carrier. In essence, the carrier is rated by the relocating employee on different service categories, and, the better the carrier rates, the lower the discount on services provided. On the other hand, if the employee perceives the quality of the move as “less than expected,” the company receives a greater discount. This kind of pricing can be especially effective when applied to a move that involves very expensive household goods and is most often used when the company is relocating an employee whose relative value to the company is considered to be “high end.”
The Contract and Employee Satisfaction
Before finalizing the relocation contract, you must agree on the duration of the contract. The typical contract will run from one to three years. Some are reviewed on a quarterly basis to address any problems or concerns. On contracts that are designed to run two or more years, a yearly pricing review may be written into the contract to allow for new cost agreements based on any changes in the tariff.
When negotiating your contract, be sure to determine whether your company or the carrier will provide post-move employee surveys so that you can gauge your employees’ satisfaction with their moves. Post-move surveys are indispensable in determining the quality of the carrier’s work. In many cases, both the carrier and the company send the employee a questionnaire once the move is completed. The van line normally sends the results of the survey to the company.
The Value of the Relationship
The final word of wisdom here involves the company’s relationship with the carrier or carriers who conduct their employee moves. Remember that, as with any business relationship, mutual respect can set the stage for a productive, successful partnership.
“I’ve always made a point to build a friendly relationship with our carriers, right down to the packers and movers,” Davis says. “We all like to feel appreciated, and I think we all do a better job when we feel our work is valued. The same goes for the people who take care of your employee moves. If they feel you respect them, the natural response is to pay you the same level of respect.”

Up on the Farm
Text by David Ferris | Photography by JJ Sulin
Flanner, 31, quit his job at E-Trade three years ago because he wanted to try his hand at farming. Still, he didn't want to give up his cosmopolitan lifestyle. He hands me a bag of mixed greens and waits expectantly for my judgment. They are fresh and tangy, the result of a special lightweight soil called Rooflite, made from mushroom compost and mineral aggregates, that's been dressed with the farm's own compost.
"Our leaves change with the weather, the compost, and the nature of the soil, which creates surprises. That's all really exciting for the chefs and the people who appreciate our produce," Flanner says. Among that number is Lois Burnett, general manager of MoMo Sushi Shack, who garnishes dishes with the Grange's microgreens. "The experience has been fabulous," she says. "The produce is really fresh, and we definitely like to talk about it [to our customers]."
A recent survey by Columbia University determined that 3,079 acres of public and private buildings in New York have rooftops that are big and flat enough to support urban agriculture. Most of these are in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. (Supplying all of New York's temperate fruits and vegetables would require 232,000 acres—an area larger than the city itself.) Onions, beans, and grains are poorly suited to urban growing, but rooftop farms could contribute a modest portion of New York's leafy greens, herbs, and vine crops like tomatoes and cucumbers.
Unless, of course, someone figured out how to grow a whole lot more food in the middle of the city in some other way.
Flanner knows where my next stop is. "Don't count dirt out," he pleads. "There's a lot to be said for dirt."
The next day is even more sweltering, and I arrive at Gotham Greens in the hottest part of the afternoon. This farm is in a desolate industrial stretch of Brooklyn near a wastewater-treatment plant. Unlike the Grange, it can be seen from the street—a greenhouse peeping over the roofline.
I walk up three flights of stairs and directly into a transparent 15,000-square-foot structure that is crowded with lush lettuce, cilantro, and parsley. No one is there. My sweat glands were bracing for the greenhouse effect, but somehow it seems a few degrees cooler than outside.
I yell hello and roust Viraj Puri, Gotham's 31-year-old CEO, who is there by himself after sending his 20 workers home because of the heat wave.
In contrast to my visit to the Grange, this interview is all efficiency. There are no interruptions. Puri explains how sensors located all over the greenhouse track temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and light levels. "All that information is fed back to a computer-controlled system, which is programmed to turn on and off to achieve the climate conditions that we desire."
There is a slight breeze created by two fans whirring overhead and vents in the ceiling and the walls, which the computer has wisely chosen to open. A layer of fabric has been drawn like a curtain over the ceiling to filter the sunlight. The Gotham model is all about control—over the building, crops, and visitors.
Puri has brown eyes and a square jaw, and his white button-down shirt shows not a speck of dirt. The entire facility, in fact, is spotlessly clean and meticulously organized, which perhaps is not surprising for an enterprise looking to create prodigious amounts of food without using soil.
The key is hydroponics. Along one wall are propagation trays, where buds of basil sprout from minuscule cubes of rockwool, a material made from superheated basalt. After a few days, the shoots are transferred to long white plastic trays, where they are fed by a stream of constantly recirculated water mixed with powdered nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.
"Crops don't technically need soil to grow," Puri explains. "What they need is oxygen, CO2, sunlight, water, and nutrients, and we're able to provide it all right here to ensure really consistent yield, very healthy crops. And we don't contend with many of the issues that conventional farms face."
The greenhouse is as peaceful as a meditation center, attended by the faint sound of splashing water. The trays are perfectly aligned, and black tubes feed them at nearly identical vectors. Jenn Nelkin, the head grower, is a hydroponics expert who once grew cucumbers and bell peppers at the McMurdo research station in Antarctica.

Welcome to a new episode of the Marc Silber Show – Advancing Your Photography! We’re in San Francisco with our guest Michael Zagaris, also known as “the Z-man”. Michael has shot some of the most amazing rock & roll photos in his career behind the music. He became the band photographer for the Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin, and the list of rock legends he captured on film goes on and on. As a rock & roll insider in those days, he took photos of what was, not what one expected to see, and as an insider today he does the same thing for 21st century bands and artists. As team photographer for the San Francisco 49ers and the Oakland A’s, Zagaris is sports’ “inside-out shooter”.
Zagaris explains his approach to photography, how to “become what you shoot”, and focus on your subject. His unique tips on composition will help any photographer capture more raw emotion and energy in their photos.

NEW YORK -- A research firm estimates that Google (GOOG) will surpass Facebook in display advertising revenue this year, beating every other company with a 15.4 percent share of the U.S. market.
EMarketer said it expects Google to rake in $2.31 billion of revenue from online display ads. These are more lucrative than the text-based ads that appear next to search results and account for the bulk of Google's revenue.
The researcher predicts that Facebook will hold 14.4 percent of the market this year
In all, eMarketer expects the display advertisement market to grow 21.5 percent this year to $14.98 billion in the U.S.

The state nurses' association denounced the terminations at the re-christened Richmond Center for Rehabilitation and Healthcare, and expressed concerns about patient care.
"We're outraged about what's happened to our members at an institution they helped build," said Bernie Mulligan, a spokesman for the New York State Nurses Association. "At the same time, we're concerned about the quality of care for the patients who are left at the facility."
Mulligan said the retained nurses were assigned to the ventilator unit.
Centers for Specialty Care Group took over the 300-bed skilled nursing and extended care facility in Stapleton on April 1 and gave it a new name.
Employees told the Advance that layoffs began immediately, both of nurses and other workers. Some of those let go had more than two decades of service. The exact number of employees released wasn't immediately clear. The facility employs several hundred.
Jason Newman, director of marketing and business development for Centers for Specialty Care Group, did not respond directly to repeated telephone calls and e-mails seeking information on the layoffs and replacement staffing.
In a broadly worded e-mail, he called the nursing home a "caring anchor for Staten Islanders for generations" and said Centers for Specialty Care "continues that tradition."
"Staten Islanders can count on us to put our residents first as we modernize this facility and raise standards for patient care," Newman wrote. "As part of that transition, we are constantly evaluating staffing needs and adjusting staff consistent with Department of Health standards and our patients' individual needs. We look forward to sharing more of our plans with Staten Islanders in coming months."
Newman did not respond to follow-up e-mails seeking clarification.
A spokeswoman for Local 1199, Service Employees International Union, declined to comment on staffing at the facility, saying the union is negotiating with Centers for Specialty Care regarding layoffs.
Jeffrey Hammond, a state Health Department spokesman, said that the agency is "monitoring care and services" at Richmond Center. But he added that the oversight isn't occasioned by any specific complaints against the facility.
Last summer, a federal judge approved the $34 million sale of the nursing home and its grounds from bankrupt Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Centers to Kenneth Rozenberg and Daryl Hagler. Rozenberg is the chief executive officer of Centers for Specialty Care Group..
According to its website, Centers for Specialty Care Group operates 21 nursing homes in New York and New Jersey. Nine are located in the city, including Richmond Center for Rehabilitation and Healthcare.
Centers for Specialty Care Group bills itself as a consortium of multispecialty health facilities that treat "virtually every type of health problem" in both inpatient and outpatient settings.
Another Rozenberg-Hagler company, SV Land I, LLC, is leasing the former Bayley Seton Hospital in Clifton. The nursing home rents 72 beds at Bayley Seton, which is down the street on Vanderbilt Avenue, for neurobehavioral patients.
The state Health Department approved the sale and lease in December, an agency spokesman said.

STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- A Graniteville teen who ran away from home more than seven months ago has been returned to his mother, after authorities found him staying with a 22-year-old woman in Pennsylvania that he met online, according to his mother.
Andrew Parker 16, left his Canterbury Avenue home Nov. 1, after he and his mother had argued about money.
"He was in York, Pennsylvania, the entire time, and he was staying with a 22-year-old woman with a 4-year-old kid," said his mother Suzanne Parker. "He met her on PlayStation."
Ms. Parker lived a parent's worst nightmare for months.
But the dogged, determined Ms. Parker never gave up hope. And got the ending she wanted.
An NYPD spokeswoman yesterday confirmed that a mother's prayers had been answered.
Andrew Parker was found in New York.
It's unclear if the woman will face charges, and representatives of the York police department did not return a call seeking comment yesterday.
"It's a state of relief," she said, noting that she's still anxious -- when he's in his room, and she's downstairs at home, for example, the thought will cross her mind, "Where is he?"
On June 13, Ms. Parker said she heard Andrew had updated his Twitter account. After talking with both "The Runaway Squad" a not-for profit specializing in missing teens, and a supervisor with the NYPD's missing persons unit, police in York found him and scooped him up last Thursday.
It turned out Ms. Parker had spoken to the woman, she said -- she was listed under a male friend's name on his cell phone's "friends and family" plan, but she had repeatedly pleaded ignorance about his whereabouts.
Andrew suffers from oppositional defiant disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Ms. Parker said, and left home after the two had argued about money and a cell phone.
He took out cash from a passbook bank account in his name, and reached out to family members with "I'm OK" messages about two weeks after his disappearance.
But the weeks became months, and Ms. Parker was left making constant phone calls and e-mails to police, contacting Internal Affairs because she felt the detective working the case wasn't responding to her, and repeatedly texting his friends to find out if they'd heard from him, she said.
"I was in constant contact with (the National Center for) Missing and Exploited Children, in constant contact with the Runaway Squad. They were a big, big help."
At one point, she staked out a Sweet 16 party of one of his friends on Staten Island, on the chance he might show up.
Last month, she spoke about Andrew in a WABC-TV special about teens with mental health disorders, "Protect Our Children: Unlocking the Mind."
Since his return, Andrew has been enthusiastic about returning to high school, and participated in a family party over the weekend, she said.
"He's coming across as a lot more mature," she said. "He's easier to talk to and communicate with and reason with."

Advice needed: Blog not rendering properly
12 December 2007 at 8:44pm Last edited: 12 December 2007 8:45pm
Hi, all... first off, kudos for making a flexible, user-friendly CMS - it's turning out to be a life saver! I am in need of a little help with the blog module, however. I installed it and am able to add new entries, but the widgets don't appear in the sidebar (even though it appears they're selected in the CMS) and all the Blog Entry Titles show up in Menu 2 instead of in the content area (as in the screenshots of the blog module).
The Blog Holder content is blank.
I have flushed the build, emptied my browser cache, etc...
No date or author fields are showing - basically it's using the same layout/presentation as the rest of the site.. does this mean it's referencing the wrong CSS file or something?
Input is appreciated, I'm looking forward to learning more about SS, but I have to get this figured out first!!

ALCONA — It’s a beautiful late August evening in Alcona.
The sun is just beginning its delicate downward descent while the sounds of 50s and 60s rock ‘n’ roll reverberates from a sound system. In a cordoned off section of the Sobeys parking lot on Innisfil Beach Road, a cadre of classic car collectors begins to grow.
One by one, automobiles of every make, colour and vintage imaginable take their allotted spot. Owners and their passengers exchange greetings with their fellow enthusiasts.
Bob Ross is in his element.
The president of the Innisfil Beach Cruisers Car Club knows by instinct there will be a large turnout this evening.
“We’re expecting at least 50 cars tonight,” he says. At our grand opening on May 12, we had 130 cars here and another 30 outside.”
Local vintage car owners started meeting informally in the Sobeys parking lot on Thursday evenings a couple of years ago with the blessing of store manager Kevin Augustyn.
Over time, these informal gatherings developed into a social network of local automobile enthusiasts, some who belonged to other car clubs. As their reputation, and size grew, people were being asked to show their cars and take part in parades and special events, the group realized it was time to add some structure.
The first meeting was held on Oct. 20, 2011 at the Coffee Time Donut shop just down the street from Sobeys. Attendance was impressive and an executive was elected. The inaugural general meeting was held a week later and the name Innisfil Beach Cruisers Car Club was chosen. Ross agreed to be president of the fledgling organization.
Their mission statement is straightforward – To promote and foster the sport and hobby of owning, showing and building vehicles of both past and present.
“We have 60 paid up members in our first year,” Ross says, “and have several members with more than one car.”
He’s the proud owner of a four-door 1939 Pontiac Chieftain, one of only five left in Canada.
“It was in a movie with Dean Martin,” Ross says. “It was for sale in Elmvale. I got a good deal on it.”
The Sobeys sojourn attracts other enthusiasts from clubs in Bradford, Barrie, Alliston and other ports-of-call.
Members of the Innisfil Cruisers often go up to south Barrie to the A&W restaurant.
“They almost bow to us there,” Ross says. “We also visit the Lakeshore Retirement residence. The folks really brighten up like you wouldn’t believe. It makes you feel really good.”
Jim Ready is also the vice president of the Barrie Thunder Classics Car Club.
The owner of a 1970 Mercury Marauder X-100, a vehicle only manufactured in 1969 and 1970, Ready says, “I’ve always been an old car buff. I retired five years ago. Now, I’ve got the time and money to do it and I love it. Take a look around. There’s a lot of cars here you don’t see on the road. Some people build their cars – I just drive and polish.”
He notes both Innisfil and Barrie groups are teaming up to visit Roberta Place on Essa Road on Sunday, Sept. 9.
The Cruisers will also be participating in the Celtic Festival at Innisfil Beach Park on Saturday, Sept. 15.
“As our Innisfil club gets bigger, we would like to do more charitable work,” Ready says. “It’s a nice, casual club and we’re on the lookout for some corporate sponsors.”
General meetings are held at Town Hall. The next one is Thursday, Oct. 18 at 7 p.m. Newcomers are always welcome.

I have been dragging my feet on starting a new series about all of the amazing and delicious varieties of vegetables available across the globe and am finally doing so. I started this blog to try my best to share simple and healthy meals and snacks with all of you and thought it would be worth focusing on all types of produce so that maybe you can discover a new favorite of your own. I suppose the idea stemmed from being quizzically asked over and over again by grocery store cashiers what the name of the vegetable was that I was buying and what on Earth I did with it.
We all get in the habit of cooking what we know, what we find familiar and the easiest to prepare. Especially when the days are long and our lives are hectic. We all know that vegetables are essential to a healthy diet but most people don't get a wide variety of produce simply because they don't know what to do with the stuff. I am guilty myself of grabbing a bunch of broccoli and some carrots at the store when I am short on time because quite simply, they are easy to prepare and my kids will eat them.
I am a serious veggie lover from way back and will buy up sacks of vegetables simply because they are in season and more importantly because they look pretty, interesting and because I love to try new things. That's how I discovered I loved Bok Choy. I never had the vegetable in my child hood so it was unfamiliar to me but one day, many many moons ago I warily picked a bright and crisp looking bunch of Bok Choy up at the grocery and it has since been my very favorite vegetable.
Artichokes are another one of my favorite veggies and I thought I'd start out the "Beyond Broccoli" series with these gems. I was introduced to them many years ago and only had them steamed and then dipped in a cayenne-mayonnaise concoction or in melted garlic butter for a long time. I have since discovered that are freaking amazing roasted or grilled and that there are healthier options for condiments and toppings to go with them. One of the very first recipes I posted here on Simply Healthy Family was for 'Lemon Artichoke Chicken over Brown Rice' I tell you that it was one of my first posts as a disclaimer because while the recipe is wonderful, the picture and post..... not so much. Live and learn. I recommend you give this recipe a go.
Le Artichoke
isn't she beautiful?
Artichokes are available all year on the West Coast, but they peak from March to May and again in October. Originating in the Mediterranean, an overwhelming majority of artichokes grown in the United States are from California. The plants are actually the buds of thistles, which are in the sunflower family.
Here are some artichoke recipes worth trying.
Grilled Artichokes with Garlic and Cheese
Italian Stuffed Artichoke
Healthy Artichoke Marsala
In the future, I will be posting my own recipes but I hope you visit these lovely sites for now and most especially, Give A New Veggie A Try!
Have you tried a new vegetable recently
or prepared an old favorite a new way?
Please do share!
Hi Gwen! Drooling! Thank you for sharing. I recently vowed NOT to eat Broccoli for a month because it had become my easy, go-to vegetable. And I just LOVE artichokes.

And all your closest friends now take demonic delight at your sheer bewilderment and change in demeanour.
Congratulations!!! You're getting married.
Things probably already feel a bit surreal and you might well be wondering how life got so crazy so quickly. But don't panic. You've done the right thing and found Simply the Best Groom and we'll help you through every part of your preparations.

There is something so magical about birthdays.
I remember being a kid and just WAITING, longing for my birthday. To be older. One of the big kids. To grow up.
Now that I am here...making my way through life as a pseudo adult, I wish I could back to being young. Back to the days when summer seemed to last forever. Long summer days drifting into summer nights. Back to when getting older was exciting and seemed to hold the unknown.
Now birthdays just means more wrinkles!
So back in December we got to celebrate a magical 5th birthday for little Avery. Its crazy to think she is just 5. She seems so much older. Probably because she is always trailing close behind her Big sister Ashtynn.
so we headed to the most Magical place in Utah County....Chuck E. Cheese!
I mean who DOESN'T want to eat food at an establishment ran by a mouse?
ITs a win in my book.
It was a lot of fun to see my nieces and their cousins running around, playing games, winning tickets and having a good time.
Avery taking her cousin Ava on a ride! Ashtynn showing off her ticket winnings. The present Adam and I picked out for Aves. Me and Gracie having iPhone fun. Avery's Uncle Colton showing off his winnings!
After the kids ran around for a while and Ate pizza it was time to move on to the present portion of this party! Watching little ones open presents is so funny. They get a kick out of the smallest things.
Nothing makes a little one feel rich like a handful of $1 bills!
Avery had the biggest smile about her Justin Beiber T-Shirt! She is in SOOOO much love with him. Its hilarious. She sings his songs and jokes about how he is in love with her too. I mean he says it on the movie! hee hee she is a riot.
things I love about Avery's littler personality:
- She is extremely rational. Tell her we will be somewhere in a minute, and she will call you out on it.
- She is bold.
- She is a sassy little one.
- She is loving and kind.
- She loves to use the Amharic we taught her over and over again.
- She is smart.
- She loves Adam. Whenever I see her she says Where's Adam? At her party she asked the same. I told her that he was working. She was sad- THAT'S not fair! He shouldn't have to be at yogurtland when Im having a party.
It was an AWESOME party and a lot of fun!
♥ theMRS.
I could not agree more with you! Birthdays means more wrinkles!
I still look forward to my birthday. Especially now that the Oscars are always right around it. ;-)
Haven't been to Chuck E. Cheese in YEARS, but you make it look like so much fun!

IL17RC Antibody Background
Interleukin-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) is a single-pass transmembrane protein that shares similarity with the IL-17R. IL-17RC functions as a receptor for both IL-17A and IL-17F, both of which are considered as factors contributing to the progression of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. IL-17A and IL-17F mediate inflammatory activities via the IL-17 receptor complex, comprised of the IL-17RA and IL-17RC subunits. Soluble version of IL-17RC should be an effective antagonist of IL-17A and IL-17F mediated inflammatory diseases. IL-17RC and IL-17RA have been found to be overexpressed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) peripheral whole blood and their expression was detected locally in RA synovium. IL-17RC protein expression was significantly higher in androgen-independent prostate cancers than in androgen-dependent ones. This protein is differentially expressed in prostatic cells and cancer tissues and may play a negative or positive role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer.

US PRESSWIRE - Presswire
Northwestern Wildcats head coach Pat Fitzgerald played word association with the Big Ten teams with interesting results.
Yeah, so I'm bringing this back. It was on the sidebar, not being used, for a super-long time, and obviously I don't have sidebars anymore, so I got rid of it, then LincolnParkWildcat reminded me about it in the comments section... I'd had plans to bring it back for a while, but I'd been sleeping on them. But here we are! I'll do this every week - Tuesdays, mostly.
I also want to discuss some stuff the redeye did on Fitz that came out today. First off, there's an interview - some interesting stuff, such as this:
I don't see myself being a [former Florida State coach Bobby] Bowden or a [deceased Penn State coach Joe] Paterno that's in their late 60s, 70s coaching. I think this is a young man's game. especially the way that I enjoy coaching. I like being active on the field. I like being involved and engaged. I don't see myself stepping away from that, and I think the minute that I do, I'm not doing my players the service that they need.
People always talk about Fitz coaching at NU for decades, but you might want to sell those 2045 season tickets if this is the case. Fitz also says Northwestern is "young and hip and cool", presumably after taking his last drag of a cigarette while waiting in line at a dubstep concert.
But what really struck me about the redeye piece is this bit where Pat Fitzgerald plays word association with the Big Ten conference. You might think you can't learn much about a man in 10 words. You are wrong. This is the most revealing thing I have ever read about Pat Fitzgerald. Here it is:
Illinois: Rival
Hey, Fitz and Tim Beckman agree on something! Good to see this faux-rivalry is really heating up. Plus, they're literally Northwestern's cross-protected rival according to the Big Ten. Good word choice.
Indiana: Respect
lollerskates, nobody respects Indiana.
Iowa: Rival
Wait, you already said riv-... oh. Oh, you're just going to say the same thing multiple times in this word association game. I mean I guess that's not against the rules but it doesn't seem optimal.
Michigan: Big House
Michigan State: Toughness
Okay, those both work.
Minnesota: Toughness
YOU LITERALLY JUST SAID TOUGHNESS. ITS THE LAST THING YOU SAID! And Minnesota isn't even that tough! Although to be fair, if somebody said "quick, what comes to mind when you hear Minnesota" I would've said "CHIPMUNK" or "COLD" or "LOSING" and he can't really do any of those.
Nebraska: Tradition
Northwestern: Rising
THE DARK NORTHWESTERN RISES, STARRING PAT FITZGERALD
Morty plays Alfred, and Prof. Bailey plays the role of Morgan Freeman always calling Batman to his office to show him new contraptions. I can't figure out Bane, but you guys probably can.
Ohio State: Huge school
Purdue: Basketball and grass
Either this is a typo, or this conversation happened:
"Excuse me, coach Fitzgerald, were you referring to Joe Tiller's spread offense at Purdue, often referred to as 'basketball on grass' due to the high amount of points that were scored?"
"No, I was referring to Purdue's high-ranked basketball team and weed."
"Okay, just checking."
Penn State: Tradition
Tradition again? I mean, it's true, but, I'm starting to wonder if Fitz only knows seven words, or is one of those pullstring talking toys for kids that only has seven phrases.
Wisconsin: Party
Congrats, Wisconsin, on finishing No. 1 in the Pat Fitzgerald party school rankings.
Anyway, on to this week's INTENSE-O-METER. Take it away:
Pat Fitzgerald INTENSE-O-METER reading: 7.7
The intensity always takes a tick upwards when Big Ten play starts, but there's more on the table this time around since Northwestern is undefeated. Indiana isn't always a big draw of anger, fury and rage, but the factors combine for a relatively high intense rating.
Have fun playing word association with Big Ten schools after the jump. To get it started, mine for Purdue is just me staring at a wall for 45 minutes while lightly drooling.

I just bought the Star Tours Droids that are a exculsive to disney. I keeped reading a lot of complaints about these figures. So I decided I'd give a reveiw of what I thought. Unlike a lot of people have been saying that the toys they are not cheap plastic. They are actually very detailed. I have always though the characters from the ride were very cool and always wanted one as a kid.
The only ones I was able to find were captain rex and the G2 droid. Both figures are suprisingly very articulated. Espeacialy Captain REX. I did get to see the R2 droid loose in a display and I also was very impressed with it. The paint job and the see through head is pretty neat. The only minor complaint is the lack of detail on the G2 droid. I expected it to be painted more like Episode one C-3P0. In all these are really cool and are up to par with any other saga figure. . I cant wait for the next set to get the micheivous G2 looking droid who is repairing the R4 in the line.
All I can say is you really should gives these figure a chance. They definetly look a lot better in person. I'm interested in knowing what everyone else who has them thinks.

representative in Microsoft's Australian subsidiary confirmed that the company has taken legal action against Hong Kong-based Lik Sang. Lik Sang's Web site has been offline for nearly two weeks, with a notice on the site blaming a server outage. Lik Sang representatives could not be reached for comment, and Microsoft attorneys were unavailable to explain the exact nature of the legal action.
Lik Sang was one of the top worldwide retailers of mod chips, devices that, once soldered to a game console's main circuit board, disable security components. The chips typically allow a game machine to play legally and illegally copied discs, run unauthorized software, and play game discs intended for other geographic regions.
Hackers have latched on to mod chips as a conduit for running homemade software on the Xbox, leading to development of programs such as an Xbox version of the Linux operating system.
Lik Sang offered a variety of mod chips for the Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2, along with game consoles with mod chips already installed by Lik Sang technicians. The company went into the manufacturing side of the mod chip business last August when it acquired OpenXbox, a mod chip design intended to allow upgrades.
Though mod chips have bothered the video game business for years, Microsoft has been particularly zealous in fighting them. The company reconfigured the Xbox's innards partly to deter hackers and has sought to hire a mod chip expert.

I purchased a few of the new Transformers (vehicles only). I also opened a couple, one being "Prowl". I chose Prowl out of the 3 "advanced" vehicles because I thought he had the best chance of having 2 normal arms. I couldn't tell from looking at the outside of the package or trying to peek in at the underneath of the vehicle. One arm ended up having the upper portion of the rear end attached as a shield and I can live with that. I am actually somewhat impressed by the toy. In robot form it stands on it's own despite it's appearance. I also opened a couple of the mini-cars. They look a little silly in robot mode, but not too bad. I kind of dig how they are very similar to hotwheels in car mode.
I have the imported red version of the corvette. I broke the tape seal and checked it out.......wasn't too impressed and put it away again. In robot mode he had a roof sticking out here, a bumper there, etc.
Have you opened any of the new Transformers? What did you think?

The Skin Cancer Foundation's Position Regarding UVR-Emitting Nail Lamps
New York, NY (March 7, 2013) -. You can protect your hands from skin cancer, as well as wrinkles, brown spots and other signs of aging, by applying a moisturizing sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher to your hands at least every two hours throughout the day.
Elizabeth K. Hale, MD
Vice President, The Skin Cancer Foundation
* Typically, UVR-emitting nail lamps are used to set gel manicures. Some nail lamps emit LED light, which is not dangerous. If you are not sure which type of nail lamp your salon uses, ask your nail technician. You can play it safe by letting your nails air dry naturally, or using a nail dryer with a fan (without the light component).

In September, North Face athletes Ingrid Backstrom, Kasha Rigby, Giulia Monego, and Jimmy Chin ventured to China for a month-long expedition to summit and ski Redommain, a 20,000-foot peak in the Minya Konka Range. In the process, they tuna canned four people in a three-person tent and learned how to not sip out of each other’s urine bottles. Pro big-mountain freeskier Ingrid Backstrom talks to us about the highlights of the trip.
Is Redommain the highest peak you’ve ever climbed?
This is the highest summit I've reached, although we made it to about 24,500 feet on Gasherbrum II in 2008 during a different North Face expedition. I had more trouble with the altitude down lower on Reddomaine than up high—I went too hard too early when we were down at 15,000 feet and didn't feel so good for a few days. But we got to rest and after that I felt fine—I learned my lesson, though, and tried to really pace myself.
You traveled for 10 days before being dropped off in western Sichaun. Any stand out moments?
Probably when we crested a pass at 16,000 feet and emerged out of the fog into the sun—there was a circular rainbow (the Specter of the Brocken) and a group of beautiful Tibetan women and girls praying while they were witnessing what to them was a Buddhist miracle.
Your base camp sounds surreal…14,500 feet next to an alpine lake and below Redommain, right?
The view was the best part about base camp! But it was conveniently located next to a lake and stream; you could stare at the peak while pumping water or washing dishes.
At both base camp and high camp all four of you slept in a three-person tent? Sounds cozy.
I thought it was going to be a terrible night of sleep—17,000 feet and crammed in a tent head-to-foot. But we all just conked out, no one hardly moved, and we all slept great. Cooking and melting water was funny—you just get used to lounging on everyone's stuff, sharing spoons and cups. You quickly learn which is everyone's pee bottle and which is their water bottle.
At one point it sounds like the group decided to turn around, but after descending a few hundred feet, decided to keep going. What changed?
It just seemed like the weather was getting worse and that the sensible thing to do would be to turn around. But then we were like, "Well, the weather's bad, but the route-finding isn't hard—you just follow the ridge." Everyone had energy and felt good, and we sort of realized that just because turning around seemed like what you're supposed to do in that type of weather didn't mean that we necessarily had to.
On the descent you were put on belay to check out a section and determine whether or not it went, right?
I have skied on belay before—I was actually really stoked about this part because the snow looked good and I had a really good feeling that the ski route went and that we would be able to ski pow right to the tent. The snow was really good—my only concern was having a slab rip out, so I was happy to have the belay.
Sounds like there were times of massive exposure. How did you concentrate on making your moves more deliberate and careful?
Basically, during those times I felt so focused there wasn’t an option to freak out. I just concentrated on looking exactly where I wanted to go. No one expressed any negative thoughts out loud. Everyone was really positive outwardly, and I think we were all individually positive in our own heads. We all confessed later about times when we had felt nervous or had considered that we might have to do an open bivy. Your brain is so concentrated on what you are doing, there's no room for hypothetical concerns. Time flies by when you're focused like that.
Check out photos and trip reports from Ingrid's and Jimmy's blogs.

Strong hair is the foundation for shiny, straight hair. And strong hair is all about an impenetrable cuticle. The cuticle is the outside of your hair shaft and is made up of overlapping cells that serve as a protective layer. When the cuticle is healthy, it lays flat and locks in moisture. Your hair feels silky smooth and reflects light. Damaged cuticles allow harmful elements to enter and weaken the hair’s inner cortex, leading to dulled color, the frizzies, split ends and breakage - all road blocks in your pursuit of smooth, straight hair.
Let’s face it, we all do what is most likely to damage hair: overuse of a blow dryer or styling iron, comb or brush several times a day, and pool or beach visits to enjoy the sun and water. So while we can’t completely avoid damage, we can significantly minimize it. The first step to strengthening your hair is to get a good haircut and that means getting rid of all the split ends. While you’re at the salon, jump-start your “spoil your cuticle” regimen by getting a deep conditioning treatment.
If you want luminous, straight hair, you need hydrating products and technologically advanced tools that work together. Make sure you condition your hair every day to keep it moisture-rich. While your hair’s still wet, use an ionic detangler comb. The ionic technology gently smoothes the cuticle and reduces static electricity. Air-drying is best, but if you’re pressed for time, liberally apply styling serum that contains frizz-fighting silicone. Split your hair into sections and clip all but one section up. Blow-dry each section while gently stretching your hair straight with a ceramic-barreled ion brush - the ceramic evenly distributes heat while the ions seal cuticles.
Choose a tourmaline-infused hair dryer because it also closes cuticles, and locks in moisture while drying up to 50% faster than conventional dryers. Employ the cool shot feature to set your hair. Before you reach for the flat iron, use a thermal protecting mist that is designed to safeguard your hair from the heat. A ceramic-plated, tourmaline iron will help you achieve glowing, hydrated hair that’s never flat. Irons can reach up to 400 degrees within minutes to help you quickly straighten hair, but use caution when handling and placing on surfaces. Finish with a satiny cream or wax to control any flyaway hair.
Tired of your straightening routine? If you are willing to spend hundreds - and in some cases, well over a thousand dollars - make an appointment with a trusted professional for a chemical straightening treatment. Thermal reconditioning is the most expensive and requires you to spend the day at the salon. It’s also permanent because it alters your hair’s protein structure; only your regrowth will have your hair’s original shape and texture. The new hair can be retouched to match your treated hair. The process includes alternating chemical applications to tame, deep conditioning to ultra-hydrate, and ironing to straighten. Thermal reconditioning is not suitable for tight curls because the repeated heat styling will cause irreparable damage.
A relaxer is better for softening kinky curls and also permanently changes the structure of your hair. Both thermal reconditioning and relaxers can cause adverse reactions with previously colored or chemically-treated hair. Keratin-based treatments are appropriate for all hair types, even color-treated hair, but are also less permanent. It straightens your hair for up to four months. However, many keratin formulations contain formaldehyde to work. Because straightening your hair with chemicals carries risks, thoroughly discuss with your stylist before proceeding.
Today’s super moisturizing products and treatment advances have made straight hair more attainable than ever.
<|endofexample|>
Everyone suffers from a bad hair day now and then, but for some people, it seems that each day just marks another struggle to tame and style hair that is frizzy, unruly and sticking out in all directions. Unmanageable hair can make it difficult to look and feel your best and can make getting ready in the morning or before a special event a difficult, time-consuming and frustrating task.
Fortunately, you don't have to live with unmanageable hair. By determining the underlying cause for fly-aways and frizz, you can take steps to address the problem through home remedies, hair care products and even professional treatments.
A number of problems could be at the root of your hair's wild ways, and in some cases, the problem may come from a number of causes. There's no one quick solution to unmanageable hair, but by experimenting with different products and examining the condition of your hair, you will be able to eventually have the beautiful, easy-to-manage head of hair that you crave.
In some cases, the causes of unmanageable hair lie not in your hair itself, but in how it's cut. If the problem starts suddenly after a haircut or a switch to a new stylist, your hair may not have been properly shaped. You can revisit the salon or seek out a new stylist to even out the hairdo, add layers or cut your hair a bit shorter to fix the problem.
Even if you have had the same hairstyle and stylist for years, your haircut may still be to blame for your unmanageable hair. If your cut looks great in the salon, but never the same at home, you may be wearing a 'do that is just too difficult for you to style yourself. For example, a turned under hairstyle that requires shaping with a round brush while you blow dry can look uneven and sloppy if you find it difficult to properly turn the ends under while you hold your hair dryer. If you suspect your haircut is to blame, talk to your beautician for tips on how to easily style at home. In some cases, you may need to switch to a style that is easier for you to keep up.
To keep unmanageable hair looking its best, be sure to visit your stylist regularly for trims. Have at least one quarter of an inch cut off every four to six weeks to remove the dead ends, which can lead to frizz.
Humidity is a common culprit when it comes to unmanageable hair. When your hair comes in contact with moisture in the air, its outer layers allow the tiny droplets of water to enter your hair shaft. The shaft absorbs water at different rates, swelling unevenly across its surface. This leads to the hair becoming frizzy.
A number of hair care products are available to help fight the effects of humidity. Sprays that form a barrier over the hair shafts to prevent the fibers from absorbing moisture are a great way to finish off your style on humid days. If you're going to be outside for long periods of time, you may need a more heavy duty anti-frizz cream to keep your hair manageable. Often, these products contain sunscreen as well, which helps protect both natural and chemically-treated hair coloring from fading in the sun and suffering from dryness and damage which can lead to more issues.
Although frizz can be caused by humidity, it is also a common problem when the hair strands become too dry. As the hair shaft grows dehydrated, it develops an uneven texture that makes it less manageable. The more severe the problem of dryness, the more unmanageable your style will be.
If you suffer from dry hair, have your stylist perform a deep conditioning treatment each time you go for a trim. Salon treatments contain rich emollients that can give your hair a huge dose of moisture. Then, at home, you can continue to keep your hair hydrated by using a moisturizing hair mask once or twice per week. In addition, opt for a shampoo and a conditioner that are especially formulated for dry hair.
When styling dry, unmanageable hair, stop blow-drying when your hair is still slightly damp. This will keep you from stripping away too much moisture and exacerbating the problem of dehydration. Finish your style by spritzing on a moisturizing hairspray, which will continue to hydrate your hair throughout the day.
Hair that is damaged from chemical treatments, styling with thermal products or poor hair care techniques often has an uneven surface, making it more likely to become frizzy and unmanageable.
If you perm, straighten or color your hair, talk to your stylist about ways that you can ease the strain of the treatments. You may even need to reduce the frequency of your touch-ups or give your hair a break from permanent hair coloring by opting for a semi-permanent color for a short while. Chemically treated hair requires special care, not just to preserve the results of the treatment, but also to combat damage; ensure that you select a shampoo and a conditioner that are designed for chemically-treated hair to help keep your coifs more manageable.
Avoid using flat irons, curling irons or hot rollers on a daily basis. Your hair needs a regular break from the heat from thermal styling devices and the strain they put on the shafts. Even if you feel like thermal styling is the only way to manage your hair, you're likely just making the problem worse if you're reaching for that flat iron every day. When you do use a curling iron or other product, first spray a thermal protectant on your hair to minimize the effects of the heat.
No matter what the cause of the damage, there are some steps you can take to help repair your hair and keep it healthier and more manageable in the future.
- Always opt for a wide-toothed comb rather than a brush when styling wet hair. If you frequently develop knots, spritz on a detangler to help comb out tangles without damaging your hair.
- Never wrap wet damaged hair in a towel on top of your head after your bath or shower, as the twisting can lead to tangles and breakage. Instead, use an extra absorbent hair towel and pat your hair dry.
- Select a shampoo and a conditioner intended for damaged hair.
- Apply a hair mask or treatment designed for split ends and breakage to your damaged hair once or twice per week to moisturize and strengthen the hair shafts.
In some cases, unmanageable hair is not caused by your hair at all, but rather by problems with your diet or general health, which affect the way your hair fibers form. To improve your diet, consume the daily recommended amounts of vitamins A, C, and E, all of the B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. Also, avoid trans fats and ensure that you eat two to three servings of lean protein per day. Keep properly hydrated by drinking six to eight glasses of water daily.
You may also want to talk to your doctor about your unmanageable hair to rule out the possibility of an underlying medical condition contributing to your woes. Hypothyroidism and other disorders can have an effect on your hair, even before causing other symptoms. By getting any medical condition under control, you'll not only have easier-to-manage hair, you'll also improve your overall health.

Free play has become an overlooked commodity, somewhat deemed to be a waste of time for youngsters to engage in, but it’s the essence of physical fitness for kids. It’s good for you, too. You’ll strengthen your body—and your relationships.
Benefits
-Free play breeds a lifelong love of physical activity for kids.
-Play is a socialization tool—it teaches kids the importance of teamwork, fair play and healthy competition.
-Play promotes family fitness, values and togetherness.
-Play can challenge your body in new and functional ways and help you recover from the repetitive stress of doing similar running or gym-based workouts.
Training
Kids play shouldn't be confused with a workout. In the sense that it's physically demanding for you, it's a workout; but for kids, it's all about having fun, and it doesn't need to be complicated. It doesn't require any equipment or specific plans, just creativity. Here are some ideas to help you establish new games, obstacle courses, and fun circuits.
Sample circuit at a park
1. Jog or walk briskly to a nearby tree
2. Work together as a family to help each other climb to the first branch (one at a time)
3. Run or walk briskly to the nearest park bench
4. Perform 15 step-ups
5. Perform 8 dips off the end of the bench
6. Run or walk briskly to the swing set. Swing 30 times has high and hard as you can
7. Run or walk briskly to the slide. Take turns walking up the slide, then down the stairs. Repeat 10 times.
8. Take a 2 minute break and repeat twice more from the top
Sample games of tag
-1-Leg - Everyone hops around on one leg
-Freeze - Once tagged, you stop until a partner touches you and makes you 'free' again
-Monkey/Frog - Everyone jumps around like a monkey or frog -- both the person who is 'it' as well as those not 'it'
Sample backyard games
With younger kids, you can also play games like Capture the Flag or Simon Says. Ever play Simon Says when Simon is calling out instructions very quickly and they include things like running to a specific spot, jumping and squatting down? It's fun and physically demanding. When in doubt, just remember that young children need to engage in primal patterns of movement in order to grow up to be healthy and functional young adults. Create circuits that include these patterns:
-Crawl
-Climb
-Run
-Jump/Skip
-Throw/Kick

Whether this is your first or fifteenth time selecting players in a baseball or softball tryout, it's worth taking a few minutes to brush up on the basics of evaluating players so you can be sure to focus on what's most important. We've broken the evaluation down into 4 categories: hitting, fielding, athletic potential, and intangibles. If you pay close attention to each individual, you should be able to collect enough information in all four areas to make an educated assessment and to decide on whether or not they are a good fit.
HITTING
• Approach - how do they approach the plate?
• Comfort level - what is their presence like?
• Mechanics - do they exhibit good hand-eye coordination? Are they making contact? Do they have a good swing?
If the player is lacking in any of the above areas, are they coachable? Can the swing flaws be corrected? Remember, you have about 1 month from tryouts to the first game, so you want to be able to help them improve in that amount of time.
FIELDING
• Presence - do they look and act like they want to be out there?
• Awareness - do they stay down and move their feet to get to ground balls? Are they able to get their body under a fly ball?
• Fundamentals - are they using 2 hands? Do they have good throwing mechanics? Are their throws accurate?
ATHLETIC POTENTIAL
Based on what you've seen, does the player exhibit athletic potential? Do they have natural strengths that can be built upon to contribute to the success of your team? And can their weaknesses be impacted in a month of coaching?
INTANGIBLES
As a coach, it is your responsibility to facilitate learning and growth, so it's important to select athletes who exhibit passion and desire. Just because an athlete is quiet, or not a natural leader, doesn't mean they don't have the passion and desire to be there and to work on their game. Sometimes, it's the more timid individuals you can have the greatest impact on. So be sure to examine players on more than just their physical performance.

Sky Juice Promotion is a music management and Promotion Company based in Copenhagen promoting world music but specializes in reggae. We manage and produce artists along with promoting local and international acts, in addition we run the up and coming JamRock reggae club.
The Juice movement started in the early 90s. Sky Juice which we named the company came from a popular drink in Jamaica during the 70s and 80s, a name with a special vibes. We then started the Sky Juice reggae sound system, and set up “The Melon” reggae club which even today is still regarded as the best reggae club to have been open in Denmark.
From there on we started our own reggae band “Blue Mountain” and together with the sound system we played all over Scandinavia. It was hard work but still nuff forward movements were made, building on this progress our next step was to start promoting local and international reggae bands.
The seed was planted and the growth was steady over the years. Sky juice promotion as been involved in most if not all reggae artists and bands in Denmark talking about local artists Little Tasha one of many who started with us and has made us proud with her great progress by even winning the red stripe talent competition in Jamaica, others have moved on to higher heights while we still are guiding others for the take off.
We have successfully promoted some exciting reggae events like the first sound clash which was something of the unknown back in the days, Ragga meets Hip Hop, Reggae Splash Copenhagen, Reggae festival, Reggae SuperFest with names like Angelque kidjo, Jimmy Cliff, Gregory Isaacs, Manu Debango, Culture, Lee Perry, Burning Spear, Sly and Robbie, Third World, Dennis Brown, Beres Hammond, Luciano, Mr Vegas, Beenie man, Bushman, Capleton, Sizzla, Yellow Man, Shaggy to name a few.

Waco VPF-7
Single-engine three-seat biplane

1937 Waco VPF-7 (NC74835, s/n 4655), c.2003 on display at the Kalamazoo Aviation History Museum, Portage, Michigan (Photos © 2003 Skytamer Images by John Shupek)
Overview 2
The Waco F series was a range of American-built private pilot owner and training biplanes of the 1930s from the Waco Aircraft Company.
Development 2
The Waco "F" series of biplanes supplanted and then replaced the earlier Waco "O" series of 1927 to 1933. The Waco "F" series had an airframe which was smaller and about 450 lbs lighter than the Waco "O" series, while continuing to provide accommodation for three persons in tandem open cockpits. A similar performance to the earlier model was obtained on the power of smaller and more economical engines.
The initial models were the Waco INF with a 125-hp (93 kW) Kinner engine, the Waco KNF with a 100-hp (75 kW) Kinner engine, and the Waco RNF with a 110-hp (82 kW) Warner Scarab engine, all of which had externally braced tailwheel undercarriages. Many further sub-models followed with more powerful engines of up to 225-hp (168 kW).
Operational History 2
The Waco "F" series was popular with private owner pilots for sporting and other uses and continued in production through the late 1930s. The tandem cockpit Waco UPF-7 version was adopted by the Civilian Pilot Training Program and continued to be built in numbers (over 600) until 1942. The Waco YMF of 1934, which had a modified wider and longer fuselage, was returned to production in March 1986 by WACO Classic Aircraft of Lansing Michigan as the Waco YMF-5. Over 100 Waco YMF-5s have been completed by WACO Classic Aircraft and the type remains in low-rate production. Considerable numbers of Waco "F" series biplanes, both original and newly built, remained in service in mid-2009.

Back in December, we told you that Microsoft planned to open up six new stores in the US by the summer time. Today, however, the company announced that they’re adding five more to that list, totaling 11 new US stores to be opened up by the time that summer comes around. In 2012, Microsoft opened up a whopping 51 stores.
The five new locations being added this year include Natick Mall in Natick, MA; Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, HI; Pioneer Place in Portland, OR; The Somerset Collection in Troy, MI; and Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, IL. The six locations already scheduled for construction are as follows:.
Details are slim at this point, but the company notes that further details should arrive within the coming weeks at some point. All we know is that these stores will open by the time summer hits, which is in 4-5 months or so, obviously. Microsoft says we should expect more news in the future on openings of several more locations as well, so it seems that they’re not slowing down with retail locations.
2012 was a big year for Microsoft Stores. The company opened 51 new full-line and specialty stores during those past 12 months alone, including their first international stores in several locations in Canada. It’s rumored that Microsoft could be opening up their first European stores in 2013, which seems very likely at this point.

Microsoft has just begun rolling out a new Spring 2011 dashboard update for its Xbox 360 consoles. The update will be deployed in six phases and should complete within the next two weeks. You will know that you’ve received the update once you turn on the console and connect to Xbox LIVE. You will get a notice to download the update, which will add two major features.
This dashboard update will bring expanded PayPal support that allows you to use PayPal to purchase content such as Microsoft Points, Xbox LIVE Gold subscriptions, and Game On Demand titles. However, the new feature will not be available to gamers in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Hungary, India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan.
The update will also bring a new auto-standby feature that will place the console on standby if it is idle for more than one hour. This will help with power savings and will be automatically enabled after the update is downloaded. You can turn off this setting by going to System Settings on your console.
Microsoft’s Xbox 360 console is being hailed as the best console of this generation, and proved to be the top seller 10 out of the past 11 months. The whole PlayStation Network saga has also not helped the competing PS3 console. So for you, is it the Xbox 360 or the PS3?

Making Sense of the Credit Debacle
Entry 10:
On the corruption/criminal issue, I come down somewhere between Gillian on the one hand and Duff and Jesse on the other, perhaps tilting a little toward Gillian's point of view. This might be a little too Talmudic or Jesuitical (pick your preferred sectarian mode of thinking about complex issues). But it strikes me that there are several different forms of corruption that have been on display that cry out for different types of responses.
There's corruption of the thoroughly-legal-yet-thoroughly-destructive business model: i.e., the fact that the simple structure of the business at hand is absurdly corrupt and yet largely legal. Think Wall Street investment research in the 1990s: the rating agencies getting paid by the investment banks to rate structured financial products or advisory firms getting paid by companies selling themselves to private equity firms to issue "fairness opinions." (Wasn't it funny how the price agreed to was always fair?) This type of corruption cries out for systemic reform/action rather than individual trials, along the lines of what Eliot Spitzer did—hammering out settlements with the big players in investment research, making them pay, and forcing them to change their ways. It may even require legislation a la Sarbanes-Oxley.
There's the corruption of laziness, incompetence, and stupidity—the abysmal performance of board members that Duff refers to, poor management by CEOs, Greenspan's excellent adventure, or what Barry has referred to as "nonfeasance" by regulators. This is a really pernicious form of corruption, and in the Bush administration, it was endemic: People who had no real intention of regulating aggressively were routinely appointed to regulatory posts. Chuck Prince was woefully out of his league as CEO of Citigroup, and the board members failed to recognize that. Ditto for the sages at Lehman, the executives at AIG who oversaw the people running AIG Financial Products, the whole Fannie/Freddie complex (executives, board members, regulators), and the whole debt-underwriting complex. There are a variety of motivations at work here, although fees were the biggest single motivator. But what percentage of these activities were actual crimes? The executives who signed off on underwriting all the debt Sam Zell and Tribune Co. sold to pull off that absurd failed deal—did they commit crimes? Almost assuredly not. All the horrific numbers surrounding the company, its industry, and its prospects were fully disclosed. How about all the fund managers and asset managers who snapped up pieces of that deal? Again, almost assuredly not.
With these first two types of corruption, public trials don't seem to be useful. The bad actors feel the pain through regulatory action that, in many cases, puts them out of business as well as through market action that destroys their wealth and reputation and even their industries.
Then there's the corruption of not complying with regulations, of stealing, of lying to the public, of providing a certain set of numbers or data to the public while discussing a different set of numbers in private, or selling public office for private gain, or simply refusing to do your expressed fiduciary duty. And for these people—a broad stretch of the folks responsible for this mess that may include but is not limited to mortgage brokers, Ponzi-scheme operators, funds of funds that put cash in the hands of Madoff without conducting due diligence, hedge-fund managers who blew up clients' cash while taking their own funds out, certain executives at investment banks who told the public things were fine when in fact they knew things weren't, and financial executives who made misrepresentations to their own superiors—I say, bring on the show trials.

Double Trouble in China
Gu Kailai was convicted of murder. But was that her at the trial or her body double?
Photographs by AFP Photo/CCTV; Stringer/China/Reuters/Newscom.
A year ago, Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai had it all. The rising Chinese political star appeared to be on the cusp of joining the country’s most exclusive club: the nine-member Standing Committee of the Communist Party’s Politburo. Last February, however, the chief of police in his city took refuge in the U.S. consulate, bringing with him a remarkable story: that Bo Xilai’s wife had murdered Neil Heywood, a British businessman. Now Bo has been stripped of all political positions. His wife Gu Kailai, in perhaps the most anticipated show-trial since the prosecution of the Gang of Four in 1981, received a suspended death sentence for the murder charge. For Bo Xilai, it has been the best of times and the worst of times—and just like that Dickens novel, everything might end up with a body double receiving the death sentence.
Earlier this month, Slate reported how China’s rich and powerful can hire body doubles to stand in for them at court and in prison. China’s tradition of substitute criminals—and even substitute executions—dates at least as far back as the mid-1600s, when the early Dominican missionary Domingo Fernandez Navarrete expressed shock at the “ease and frequency with which wealthy convicts hired proxies to suffer punishments on their behalf.”* To put it another way, this practice, called ding zui in Chinese, has flourished in China for longer than the United States has existed.
The most recent allegations of a substitute criminal began the moment people saw Gu Kailai enter the courtroom. Gu’s appearance had changed so much that even her own relatives were confused. The New York Times reported that Gu “appeared to have gained considerable weight, and a relative expressed shock, saying her face had changed dramatically since they had last met.” The Wall Street Journal wrote that Gu was “a bit heavier and less glamorous than in photographs of her that have been published in news stories around the world since the scandal broke,” adding the explanation that most of the photographs “were taken between five and 15 years ago ...”
Many in China, however, felt Gu looked different because she was different. Western expatriates were soon “abuzz with talk that the woman who appeared in the dock” may be a body double. Chinese netizens began posting and circulating accusations of a criminal stand-in, which were quickly censored by the government, only to live on in snippet form as Google caches. For example, the cached form of one now-erased message containing hits for “Gu Kailai” and “ding zui” begins: “I used to hear old folks talk about how in the old days, when somebody committed a crime, they could spend money and buy a person to be their substitute. Today, there are still people who can spend money and buy a person to be their substitute …” (Clicking the link, however, results in the message: “Sorry! The page you are looking for doesn’t exist or has been deleted.”)
This Web page, which has so far survived, claims to show images of “The Real and Fake Gu Kailai,” asserting: “No matter how a person’s face might change, the facial structure, eyes, and the distance between the eyebrows remains the same. The angles of the photograph might have some effect on one’s appearance, but even so, the tip of an adult’s nose is never going to change. The photo of ‘Gu Kailai’ in court shows a nose that is clearly rounded and full with flesh at its tip, while the Gu Kailai in the photo with Bo Xilai has a sharply pointed nose.”
One viral rumor, remarkably detailed in its allegations, displays side-by-side images of the woman in court and Gu, together with the headline: “Huge News: The woman who is the body double for Gu Kailai is a roughly 46 year-old Langfang resident named Zhao Tianyun.” A subheading urges the public to work together through crowd-sourcing to solve the body double mystery. Several paragraphs then describe how the author supposedly learned from a friend working in the Chinese government that Zhao Tianyun was Gu’s body double, and that the real Gu is still living in Beijing. Apparently to prevent this message from spreading, the Chinese government has blocked all searches for the term “ti-shen” (body double), a phrase appearing within this message, as well as searches for the name Zhao Tianyun.
While China certainly has substitute criminals—the media occasionally reports arrests of some would-be substitutes—it is difficult to estimate the frequency of the practice. With ding zui, the whole purpose of the crime is to prevent people from knowing it has even occurred. Since the only known instances of ding zui are those that have been solved, it is difficult to know whether it is a frequent crime rarely discovered or whether it is a rare crime frequently foiled. Further complicating things, wealthy and powerful families who can arrange criminal substitutes seem unlikely to be exposed by the police, government officials, or media.
Geoffrey Sant is a frequent commentator on CCTV, Phoenix Television, Global Times, and other Chinese-language media, and his Chinese-language writings have been published in Zhong-guo Shi-bao, Zhong-yang Ri-bao, and in an anthology of the year’s best Chinese-language writing. He is also a director of the New York Chinese Cultural Center.

Jeremy Lin Craze Continues After the Knicks’ Tuesday Buzzer Beater
|
Posted Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2012, at 4:07 PM
You know the buzz around Jeremy Lin isn’t going away any time soon when the New York Knicks star continues a winning streak by hitting a game-winning three pointer.
That’s what the point guard did Tuesday night, bringing his team a 90-87 victory over the Toronto Raptors. The Harvard grad’s sudden rise in the headlines has been fueled by social media and stellar stats; in six starts, Lin has managed to tie the Knicks’ all-time team record for most consecutive games with over 20 points and seven assists.
But it doesn’t hurt that a narrative about being overlooked in a sport with few Asian players to begin with continues to interest fans and reporters—and landed the 23-year-old on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Add to that the fact that two men in California are already in a trademark battle over a growing social media vocabulary standout—“Linsanity”—and you’ve got a recipe for a Cinderella story that’s far from over. Stay close to the phone, Jeremy—Fruit of the Loom could call any minute.

How Much More Exposed Can Levi Get?
|
Posted Monday, Oct. 19, 2009, at 1:40 PM
First there were the TV interviews . Then the pseudo-folksy " Me and Mrs. Palin" article and the pistachio ad . Now our Levi is going for the ultimate exposure, posing in his skivvies for Playgirl . He’s the talentless teenager who won’t go away.
Whether he’s showing his johnston or not in the photo spread is still to be revealed. What is clear is that Levi, in his attempts to milk his sudden fame for all it’s worth, has fashioned himself into some kind of ironic representative of failed conservative ideals. ( His ad for pistachios riffs about "using protection .") The only thing is that the joke’s not funny anymore. It’s sad. Not because the realist message he’s awkwardly promoting isn’t true (there is, after all, a baby somewhere to prove it), but because he’s so talentless that his only path to success (monetary at least) is to sell himself as a déclassé example of bad choices. I can already taste the "Who could be abstinent with THIS body?" jokes that are going to accompany his nude photos.
I feel for the kid. His story reads like a bizarro version of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington : A young naïve man is thrust into the national political scene and gets in way over his head. Only in this rendition, incapable Levi doesn’t stand at a pulpit reforming politics for the better, but does the only thing he can-cashes in on his predicament through tabloid spectacle. Blatantly criticizing him for taking advantage of a situation he was dragged into to begin with seems a little like putting a dog in a room full of bacon-wavers and then getting mad when he bites. So I won’t neg him for stripping down, but I’m still going to secretly pray we’re spared a Living Levi reality show.

I have also just finished replacing my battery with a 5000mAh version. I was able to do it with less modification as in the link above. It feels substantially heavier. I hope I don't get tired holding it :)I have it on a charger, I will have to see how the charging goes.
While looking the PC board over, I noticed there is an additional speaker port. I wonder if any sound is piped there. There is also a notification LED spot but nothing loaded. And the microphone isn't aligned with a hole it is just pointing at empty space.
If there are any requests I might pop the back off and post a pic and detailed instructions. The Russian ones are excellent of course but some bits were confusing. Now that I went through the procedure, I found alternatives that worked.

The Lucky One Movie Review Exclusive

Date Movie Review, The Lucky One Warner Bros Entertainment...
Date Movie Review, The Lucky One Warner Bros Entertainment
By James Rickman III, See website
It was a joy for my date and I to watch The Lucky One, a movie drama produced by Warner Bros. Entertainment. The story line of the movie captures the familiar struggle of a returning veteran soldier U.S. Marine Sargent Logan Thibault (well played by actor Zac Efron) trying to make sense of his three tours of duty in Iraq. Equally compelling was the story of a single mother, Beth (beautifully acted by Taylor Schilling) in her quest to answer why her brother had been killed at war. The cinematic photography was powerful with magical scenes set in the Bayou of Louisiana. The Lucky One is a well-crafted movie directed by Scott Hicks.
Dialogue in the movie, The Lucky One was artfully done. I enjoyed the scene where Beth suspicious of the stranger, Logan, tests his intelligence by asking what favorite quote in philosophy he recalls from college. Logan answers, "Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple." It's a quote from a Dr. Seuss book that reminds us to look beyond all the confusion in life to find those small nuggets of gold.
Supporting actor, Jay R. Ferguson did a brilliant jobs playing the cocky police officer, Keith Clayton. In the movie, Clayton is the controlling divorced father of Beth's son, Ben (nicely played by Riley Thomas Stewart). Blythe Danner plays the grandmother (Ellie) who runs a dog kennel adding a humorous wisdom and self-knowledge that we should accept life on its terms. It seems at times there is no rhyme or reason why things happen in life but eventually the answer is revealed to us.
The Lucky One is based on the novel written by Nicholas Sparks. The movie presents real life challenges in a charming and gentle way. The characters are well played ever the "villain"; Clayton gives us a sense of humanity. The Lucky One takes us on a complete life journey in time; a snapshot period in a family's life that changes the course of their being.
I recommend, The Lucky One, as a great date movie and family film that really hits home on a lot of levels. It's a joyful movie that leaves a good feeling in your stomach. I rate The Lucky One a solid four star (4 out of five).

Have you ever made freezer jam?
Freezer jam retains the zing and luscious fresh raspberry taste so beautifully. Cooking the fruit kills a lot of the taste, but the freezer jam's amazing!
Raspberries are my favorite, I swear. My grandparents had a HUGE raspberry patch along the east side of their huge garden, and every single day in the summer, my grandmother would pick buckets of berries, then she'd can them, freeze them, make freezer jam with them, bake raspberry pies and raspberry sour cream pies and freeze them, also....imagine how welcome one of those little puppies was on a cold, frosty winter day in January!
My grandmother would reheat the pie, top it with fresh whipped cream, farm-style, thick as butter and serve it to my grandfather and my uncle for afternoon tea, just before they went out to do the chores in the barn. Coincidentally, I'd be arriving home from school on the bus about that time, so of course, I'd get my fair share, as well...spoiled little girl!
If you need a recipe for freezer jam, I can post one, There are several included in the Certo packages that I buy. Certo is a brand of fruit pectin I use to make freezer jam.
Easy as pie!

Continuing on from yesterday's post about Santa Cruz, today I want to talk about a Santa Cruz winery - Bonny Doon.
This is Randall Grahm, who started Bonny Doon in 1983. The Snooth.com website says:
Based in Santa Cruz, the heartland of New Age thinking and dreaming, Bonny Doon Vineyard has a not so surprising history of idealism and innovation. Founded in 1983 by Randall Grahm, Bonny Doon is known for strikingly original wines made from “lesser” known grape varieties, the so-called vinous Ugly Ducklings. Originally focused on pinot noir, Bonny Doon Vineyard made its mark on the vinous world with its pioneering work with Rhône varieties and innovative production techniques. Since the adoption of Biodynamic® farming practices in 2004, Bonny Doon Vineyard wines evince a deeper sense of place, complexity, varietal expression and a noticeable sense of organization.
An even better recap of Grahm's career with Bonny Doon is this article on TribLIVE website Here's an excerpt:
Creative label art and pun-laden wine names became synonymous with Grahm's unique brand of salesmanship and outsize humor. He never took himself too seriously, but he embraced any gambit to sell quality wines at good value.
The labels are indeed very creative! All kinds of colors and images. I would buy the wine just for the wonderful labels! Take a look at this row of bottles and all of the colorful labels:
And the wines are unusual - Rhone style, some with grapes you have probably never heard of. Personally, I like trying unusual types of wines
Another excerpt:
Grahm also earned a well-deserved reputation for irreverence toward the sacred cows of the uptight, pretentious wine establishment. With tongue planted firmly in cheek, he penned "Periodic Transmissions From the Mothership" in hilariously esoteric and satirical newsletters now collected on the Web site.
The Bonny Doon newsletters have always been witty and off-the-wall and absolutely hilarious. Take a look on their website for some examples.
I received a gift of two bottles of Bonny Doon wine recently - 2007 Ca' Del Solo Orange Muscat and 2005 Bonny Doon Syrah Le Pousseur. Both very tasty. And look at the beautiful labels:
PS - I had a comment from Cubbies, one of our Slow Travel members who told me that the New York Times had just published an article about Randall Grahm.
You are giving me a great education. I think the labels are collector's items. They're great!

SEATTLE • Many Europeans are fretting these days over horse meat, and whether it might have adulterated their shepherd’s pie. Over here, it’s all about the red snapper.
That tempting seafood delight glistening on the ice at the market, or sizzling at the restaurant table in its aromatic jacket of garlic and ginger? It might.
Part of the problem, said the study’s chief author, Kimberly Warner, is that there are quite simply a lot of fish in the sea, and many of them look alike. Overall,.
Geographically, the study had bad news for residents of Southern California, land of the midnight sushi. They were more likely than residents in any of the other sampled regions to be eating something other than what they had been told. About 52 percent of the samples bought and sent for testing turned out to be something else.
Salmon-crazed Seattle, by contrast, was tied with cod-country Boston as having the lowest deception rates. Still, almost 1 in 5 fish samples were wrongly labeled.
Some types of fish fared worse in different places. In New York, for example, fish that was not really tuna was being passed off as tuna in 94 percent of the samples taken, the study said.
What is in a name, anyway, when it comes to fish? Shakespeare might not have pondered the question exactly, but the seafood industry certainly has.
In the real world of perception and marketing, a fish called “slimehead” — a real name, by the way — is probably not going to fly off the menu. Far better to call it “orange roughy,” a distinction allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The government also allows Patagonian toothfish, real name, to be called Chilean sea bass, invented marketing name. actually to be farmed Atlantic salmon, which is considered less healthy and environmentally sustainable.
The National Fisheries Institute, a trade group representing the industry, did not respond to a request for comment on the study. But the institute has specifically criticized Oceana’s work in the past as being more agenda-driven than scientific and rigorous.
Warner said that the study did raise some red flags about health. Fish known to accumulate mercury in their flesh, in particular, should be avoided, especially by pregnant women. But in what the study called “one of the most egregious swaps,” in New York, tilefish — known for its mercury content and on federal advisory lists for sensitive populations to avoid — was sold as red snapper. Tilefish was also found substituted for halibut.
She also cautioned that the study did not aim to produce a real scientific, top-to-bottom sampling of the seafood system. In Boston, for example, only grocery store fish were tested, leaving out sushi bars that might have lowered the city’s honesty rate (although, in a separate effort in 2011 and 2012, The Boston Globe found widespread mislabeling in stores and restaurants).
And the Oceana study’s authors also could not determine where in the food chain the mislabeling arose — the wholesaler, the retailer or at the fishing dock itself — or whether it came about through misunderstanding or deliberate concealment.
A common pattern, though, Warner said, was economic gain at the consumer’s expense, with understudy fish — tilapia, in particular — often substituting for a menu’s star, without a word to the audience.

Biggest win » 123-121, 3OT against Dallas on April 16
Biggest loss » 139-133, 4OT to Atlanta on March 25
Big numbers » The Jazz’s three main veteran pieces -—Devin Harris, Millsap and Jefferson — hold expiring contracts during the 2012-13 season. Combined, they’re worth about $33.5 million next year.
Jazz guard Gordon Hayward saw light, but couldn’t shake the feeling he had let his team and himself down when Utah needed him most.
"I won’t feel good until [the playoffs] are over," said Hayward, who took a strong stride forward in his second season, but shot just 18.2 percent from the floor and 8.3 percent behind the 3-point line in his first postseason. "It’s always difficult after a loss, especially after the last game not even scoring. To drop a goose egg — that’s tough."
Such is the state in Jazzland, heading into what could become a pivotal offseason for a small-market team loaded with promise but filled with uncertainty.
End result
San Antonio’s merciless 4-0 sweep highlighted the questions everyone from Corbin and O’Connor to Al Jefferson, Paul Millsap and Hayward face as Utah attempts to turn the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference playoffs into something more fulfilling.
The Jazz’s young core of Derrick Favors, Alec Burks, Enes Kanter and Hayward is more exciting than ever. Corbin found his touch after the All-Star break, saving Utah from a second consecutive second-half fallout and turning an uneven 15-18 record on Feb. 28 into a promising 36-30. The Jazz’s Big Two of Jefferson and Millsap formed one of the premier interior combinations in the NBA, with both putting up All-Star caliber numbers and each playing the best overall basketball of their careers.
But after 66 up-and-down regular-season games and an instantly forgettable playoff performance, none of the major issues surrounding Utah when the 2011 NBA lockout ended has a clear answer five months later.
The Jazz don’t have a point guard for the future, while Hayward has yet to be cemented at either shooting guard or small forward. Millsap and Jefferson are bigger than ever, but there’s no guarantee either will wear a Utah uniform after the 2012-13 season ends. The Jazz’s defense is still filled with painful holes, while the team’s inside-out offense became so predictable during the playoffs, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich filled the paint and dared Utah to shoot from outside. It couldn’t, firing blanks to the numbers of 38.2 percent from the field and an embarrassing 20 percent beyond the arc, which produced an average of 86.3 points — 13.4 off the Jazz’s regular-season mark.
"We like what we have. But you can always add and enhance and build on where you are," Corbin said. "As you get better, you can do some different things. As we get more used to each other, there’s always options off what we have. So the [offensive] sets are fine. We just have to add and be able to change some things."
New path
Then there’s the biggest issue of all: Utah still doesn’t have an identity.
It was Corbin’s main goal during training camp and he hammered away at the idea throughout the season, forgoing a team captain in the hope all of his players would buy into the same vision. The Jazz mostly did, and a resilient team fought through injuries and low expectations to produce one of the strongest locker rooms the Jazz have had since Deron Williams was drafted.
But by the time the NBA’s first season was eclipsed, 14 teams were eliminated and the real season — the playoffs — began, Utah was exposed. The Jazz didn’t have the mental confidence or physical backbone required for a two-week fight, and Jefferson’s pre-Game 4 statement that Utah had no chance to beat San Antonio captured the weaknesses of a team whose physicality, drive and composure collapsed.
"We’re creating [an identity]. It’s still a process. We’re better and we’re closer [now] than we were at the beginning of the year," Corbin said. "We had some great lessons this year and this playoff has taught us a few more things about how much more work we have to put in to be the team we’re looking to be."
O’Connor outsmarted the lockout, stacking the Jazz’s roster three-deep at most positions and bringing in proven veterans Jamaal Tinsley and Josh Howard to help Utah navigate an unforgiving season.
The Miller family continued to prove it will spend money at the right time, allowing O’Connor to add DeMarre Carroll down the stretch.
Corbin took a roster many saw as one-dimensional and wisely played to its strengths, all while gradually working in young players such as Favors, Burks and Kanter as the season evolved.Next Page >

West Valley City • All eyes were on first-grader Mason Fackrell at Whittier Elementary on Thursday, and for once, it wasn't because of his scars.
When Mason was 18 months old, a pan of hot cooking oil fell on him. The accident resulted in significant scarring to his face and hands.
"He gets stares all the time," said Mason's aunt, Aliesha Doxey. "That's hard for a little kid, you know, [he] gets self-conscious."
So Mason's family asked the West Valley City Fire Department to step in and help boost the boy's confidence. Firefighters on Thursday granted that request, visiting Mason's school to educate the boy's peers on fire safety. In the process, they made the 6-year-old feel more comfortable with his appearance.
Nearly 100 first-graders watched as Mason raced with a firefighter to get dressed in fire-fighting gear. The students giggled and cheered as Mason, with the help of firefighter Mike Reardon, donned the massive boots, suit and helmet. Mason was fully dressed and ready to fight fire by the time the professional firefighter racing Mason managed to get his head gear on.
The students met firefighters and examined their heavy coats and thick gloves. Students checked out a fire truck, saw the fire hose and listened to the loud call of the engine's siren.
Reardon said there is a myth that young children are afraid of the fire department when they respond to emergencies, so firefighters like to create awareness of what they look like when they are all suited up.
Thursday's visit was the fire department's second visit to Whittier to help Mason's classmates understand why he looks different. Firefighters attended Mason's kindergarten class last year, with hopes of easing childrens' confusion about the boy's burns.
"It's a good day," Reardon said. "We look forward to days like this. This one in particular."
The effort is appreciated by Mason's relatives, who have endured heartache listening to the boy tell stories about the teasing he has received.
"He's had kids call him a monster â¦ People say 'eww, what's happened?'" Doxey said. Mason's mom knew that her son's scars would make some kids uncomfortable, she added.
"She knew there'd be lots of stares [and] so many kids for him to have to explain to," said Doxey.
Mason's experiences at a burn camp he attended after his accident helped him to prepare for some of the stares and the questions. The camp, sponsored by the University of Utah in Millcreek Canyon, gives young burn victims the opportunity to have fun and develop confidence in a safe environment.
"They teach him when people stare they're not being mean, but they're just wondering what happened," Doxey said.
Now when people ask Mason about his scars he knows just what to tell them: "I got burned by hot cooking oil."
As attention surrounded him Thursday, Mason said it was a surprise to see firefighters at school. He thought perhaps firefighters came to visit because of that happy coincidence that he wore his junior firefighter sweatshirt to school, he said.
The boy acknowledged that sometimes it's difficult to have scars, but his aunt said her nephew doesn't let his past injuries get him down.
"He's full of life," she said. "Even though he has suffered the burns he seems to get by just great."
She said Thursday's event meant the world to Mason, who one day hopes to become a firefighter himself.
"He's going to have a hard time his whole life with his scars," Doxey said. "But something like this he gets to feel special for a day, you know, hopefully he'll get more days like this."

Tackling the daily challenges of teaching all the core subjects to special-education students at Granger High School is what inspires Beckey Carson to work so hard at her craft.
Her peers took notice of her dedication and determination, nominating her for the Utah Education Association Excellence in Teaching award. Carson was one of 10 teachers in the state who were recipients of $1,500 courtesy of the Arch Coal Foundation at the Superstars in Education banquet in October.
"I feel so humbled," Carson said about the award. "They pick out 10 educators out of maybe 80,000 UEA members, so it is a very humbling experience."
With more than 18 years at Granger, Carson is a mainstay on campus and has the responsibility to teach all subjects, from health to U.S. and world history, to special-education students at the West Valley City school. She also goes above and beyond teaching as she write grants to enrich her students' learning, and that effort doesn't go unnoticed by school administration.
"She does a great job of getting grants from different areas to help students with their needs," said Granger High principal Jerry Haslam. "She is also one of the first teachers here in the morning and then the last one to leave at night."
Most people outside the classroom would view teaching special-education students as an additional challenge to a teacher, but Carson fell in love with the students right from her first job as a teaching assistant in a self-contained classroom nearly 30 years ago. It was that moment she knew where she wanted to be as a teacher. Her feelings for her students haven't waned over the years.
"I absolutely love it," Carson said. "I can't imagine teaching any other population.
The students realize that they have certain learning disabilities, but they are confident they can overcome the stigma with help and they come to class wanting to learn, according to Carson.
Karen Newton, who has worked with Carson for 20 years, knows that one of her colleague's best strengths is her willingness to listen to students and make a connection.
"Her students know that they can go to her for anything because of her willingness to listen," Newton said of Carson. "I often told her that she should put a couch in her classroom because it seems that everyone goes in to talk to her because she is such a good listener."
Observing her students give it their all to overcome their challenges makes it all worth it for Carson.
"Watching them overcome challenges and their willingness to try is rewarding," she said. "It also makes you really appreciate what you have in life."

Q: Our ferret has adrenal gland disease. She has had two surgeries and several melatonin implants. However, the last implant failed (or came out). Our veterinarian said she was told that the implants are only good for three times, but I've never heard this anywhere else. Should we ask her to try another melatonin implant, or lupron? Any other suggestions? The veterinarian doesn't want to attempt any more surgeries because of the age of our ferret and the position of the remainder of the adrenal tumor. A: We don’t have enough data to know how many lupron injections or melatonin implants can be given to a ferret before they stop working. This is because every ferret adrenal tumor is different and most tumors change over time.
I can understand the reluctance of your veterinarian to perform any more surgeries.
It would not be wrong to ask your veterinarian to try lupron or another melatonin implant or any of the other treatments we have for adrenal gland disease..

Today's signature recipe is Shannon's Green Smoothie! Shannon is recently back from maternity leave after having baby Edith around the New Year.
----
Need a detox? Sometimes a cool smoothie, packed with mango & spinach, is just what the doctor orders. Plus, cramming in a serving of vegetables is always a plus! Just make sure you puree it a bunch, so it's nice & smooth!
Ingredients
1 cup frozen mango chunks
1 big handful of raw spinach
1/2 cup of water or milk
1 tablespoon sugar (or agave syrup. or a date.)
Preparation
Throw all the ingredients into a blender and puree for a few minutes.
On Friday, March 15th, Small Farm Central and PASA held our first online CSA Expert Exchange with presentations by Elizabeth Henderson, Lynne Rossetto Kasper of Splendid Table, Gary Brever of Ploughshare Farm, Jody Bolluyt and Jean-Paul Courtens from Roxbury Farms and our very own Simon Huntley. We crammed a lot of material into a four-hour session. Overall the feedback has been extremely positive and we think it helped stimulate a lot of great conversations about the state of Community-Supported Agriculture in 2013. Here is some feedback we received from our post-conference survey:
“How useful was the CSA Expert Exchange? What was your overall impression of the event?”
On a scale of 1 (not useful) to 5 (very useful), 61% of respondents said it was very useful, with an overall rating of 4.44.
“Based on the price you paid for the conference, do you feel this was a good value?”
On a scale of 1 (not a good value) to 5 (very good value), 49% of respondents said it was a very good value, with an overall rating of 4.02.
“Do you feel the material was appropriate for your experience levels?”
Almost 89% of respondents said the material was “just right” with the remaining 11% saying the material was “too basic”.
“Did you find the format of the online conference worked well? Did you have any problems?”
While there were a number of concerns and suggestions about how to improve the online format, 80% of respondents said that the “Format worked out well.”
Based on this response, we will definitely be working on more online events in the future. We asked our attendees what format they would like future events to have – a multi-hour single day event, three one-hour evening sessions during the spring, or a series of one-hour sessions over the course of the year. While the majority of respondents (70%) said they would prefer the single day event, there was also significant support for the other options as well. We are currently a series of shorter one-hour sessions throughout the year along with a more comprehensive multi-hour event again next year in late-winter/early-spring.
Some topics that respondents wanted to hear more about included: how to select and purchase equipment, packing and distribution methods, marketing your CSA, hosting a successful on-farm member event, general workflow efficiency, and legal issues.
If you didn't attend this particular event but have feedback on what you'd like to see from future online seminars and conferences, please get in touch at conference@smallfarmcentral.com.

Plymouth, MA – April 2, 2009 -
With the launch of their Free Taste Test Sample program, SmartPak™ is helping to solve the challenge of the picky eater. Since introducing its pioneering SmartPak service in 2000, riders and horse owners have come to rely on SmartPak not just as the typical catalog supplier, but as a true partner in the care of their horse, offering innovative solutions to the problems that horse owners face. Horse owners with picky eaters face the dilemma of buying a bulk supply of a supplement only to have their horse turn up his nose and refuse to eat it. Not only is the situation frustrating for the horse owner, it’s also costly. SmartPak is solving this problem by offering FREE samples for the 300+ supplements they carry.
"We have hundreds of conversations with horse owners every day about their supplement feeding programs and all too often we hear about their struggles with picky eaters," commented Becky Minard, founder and senior VP of SmartPak. "When you have a horse who's a picky eater, it can become time consuming and costly to find a product that will work for him. It really got us thinking about what we could do to help these horse owners out and we think the sampling program will be a great solution."
SmartPak customers are excited about the program too. In a recent email to SmartPak's Customer Care department, one horse owner commented "Thanks again! I just received a trial sample and gave it to my mare yesterday with grain. Thankfully she gobbled everything up. Customer service is alive and well!"
This new program takes advantage of supplying the samples in the popular daily dose SmartPak supplement feeding system, and complements the other efforts SmartPak has already undertaken to help solve the picky eater problem. These efforts include offering flavored carrot and apple pellets to mix with supplements for horses receiving minimal grain, use of its signature fenugreek flavoring – clinically proven to be the most preferred flavor by horses – in its SmartSupplement line of products, and coming this spring, pelleted versions of many of SmartPak’s SmartSupplements™..

Review by:
Elizabeth McCoy
on Aug. 26, 2011 :
This is a combination murder mystery and romance. The characters are really quite entertaining, overall, and for the most part, the off-again-on-again emotional connection of our protagonists feels pretty reasonable. The mystery part doesn't quite follow all the mystery tropes (mystery buffs may be disappointed), from what I know of mystery tropes, but it's being an unexpectedly deep backset to a romance, with romancy tropes -- and those seeking romance tropes should be satisfied, methinks.
I do quibble at the scene where the readers are given the who-dun-it identity; I wish there'd been some other way to get that data across. But it's pretty minor and a personal quibble; I just don't like "spoilers" for mysteries, even when the author's doing the "spoiling"!
My main complaint is the last two chapters, where the emotional half of the situation wraps up in a way that is kind of... syrupy-sweet. I think that Vanessa's personality was shifted to something overly traditional, instead of pleasingly tart. (I liked her attitude, darnit! Why shouldn't a fulfilled romance still have a few prickles amidst the roses?)
Still, that's two chapters out of many, and since I can't do half-stars, I'll err on the side of more, rather than less.

England down Pakistan in World Cup warm-up
Kevin Pietersen thrived in his new position as opener while Stuart Broad clinched a second successive five-wicket haul as England beat Pakistan by 67 runs in their final World Cup warm-up on Friday.
Pietersen hit a blistering 66 off 78 balls with three fours and a six before he was stumped by Kamran Akmal off slow left-armer Abdur Rehman in the 26th over.
England went on to make 273 all out with Paul Collingwood making a timely 65 after a recent poor run of form.
However, captain Andrew Strauss lasted just 11 balls for his five runs before he was clean-bowled by Shoaib Akhtar.
Veteran Akhtar, who was fined by officials on Wednesday for a late night out, finished with figures of one for 62 off his 10 overs which will not help his chances of playing in Pakistan's World Cup opener against Kenya on Wednesday.
Fast bowler Broad, who took five wickets in the narrow 16-run win over minnows Canada in England's opening warm-up clash, repeated his magic with five for 25 off 8.1 overs as Pakistan were all out for 206 in the 47th over.
Broad dismissed opener Mohammad Hafeez for a duck in his first over before getting rid of Kamran Akmal and Umar Akmal as Pakistan slumped to 34-3.
Former captain Younis Khan gave Pakistan some hope as he made 80 before becoming Broad's fourth victim late in the game.
The English seamer then had Wahab Riaz caught by Jimmy Anderson for his fifth wicket.
Collingwood completed a memorable night by finishing with three for 48.
The match was the first clash between the two teams since last year's series in England that was overshadowed by 'spot fixing' allegations which led to lengthy bans for Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamer.
England will open their World Cup against the Netherlands in Nagpur on Tuesday while Pakistan face Kenya in Hambantota in Sri Lanka the following day.

Graduation Cookies — A Smart Gift!
Graduation is a time of great joy and looking forward — a celebration of finish and a next step toward the future. But it’s hard to come up with good graduation gifts — a graduation present worthy of your tasseled transitioner.
You see where we’re going here, don’t you? After all, what could commemorate such an honorable commencement better than one of our graduation cookie gifts? OK, a trip to the Bahamas might be a little bit more coveted, but it doesn’t taste near as good and takes a lot more dough!
So, if you’re celebrating a graduation — any kind at all — preschool, kindergarten, middle school, high school, college, law school, nursing school, vo-tech, animal husbandry, a master’s program, doctorate, medical degree or a certification in automotive technology, and looking for a graduation present, our graduation cookies will make your graduate’s success all the sweeter (you might want to throw in some cash, too).
You can even create your own Smiley cookies in school colors to mark the path of ongoing education and ever-hungry minds.
Speaking of hungry, our graduation cookies are a great way to feed your graduate’s excitement for continuing his or her dream and also a great way to keep his or her friends enjoying their big day. The odds of leftovers are about as slim as the chance of having money after you pay the school loans!
Of course, our graduation cookies come in a colorful array of delightful combinations, allowing you to choose the gift that most expresses your pride in your graduate’s success. All you need do is select from our exciting line of graduation presents and click to order.
And when you click, know that your graduation cookies are freshly baked, hand-iced and delivered straight from our peanut free, kosher bakery to the lucky recipient — quicker than your graduate can expel that “F” in woodshop from his or her record.
Not that an “F” in woodshop is anything we note. All we do is concentrate on bringing you cookies worthy of a diploma — summa magna cum laude — and getting them to your graduation celebration as fresh and sweet as the fit of that cap and gown on the commencement lawn — the taste of a new beginning, the smile that means you’ve got class!

Group exercise, not my cuppa tea.
BackstoryOK, it is Sunday morning and there is class at noon. Plenty of time to get ready. But for the last two hours, I've been talking myself out of it. It is now 11:20. Class is 20 min away. I'm not ready.
So, what is my problem? I think I just don't like group exercise. I'm a loner type. I'm an empath, and I have PTSD. I hated gym in school, hate the thought of being embarrassed by the instructor, hate feeling like an imposter. I'm 78% introvert. I'm probably higher, but I lied on some of the questions to look better.
So what DO I like? Walking, riding my bike (alone, slow-ishly), video exercise in home, weights (light weights).
I obviously have had success, lost 50# doing it like this. Both my acupuncture lady, my nutrition lady think I need to get out to exercise, with people.
Nobody really socializes at exercise. They rush in, have class, and rush off again. That's my experience. Even back in the day when I went to Jazzercise. Some people are really good at meeting other people, I'm not one of them. I'm nice, friendly, I just don't talk much in a group.
So, here's my new plan. Do what works best for me. Lately I've felt so bad about not being able to go to yoga, I've stopped everything. Like I'm a big fat failure.
Well, poof, enough of that! We're all made differently. I can hardly tell you how much relief I feel coming to this realization. It makes me feel like dancing! (alone in my house).
For now. Until **I** feel differently. Not when someone else says I should feel differently. Big lesson for me. :)
MO_Thoughts2 says,I tried the class exercise, and enjoyed it, but it was hard to make the classes all the time between work and the kids. So I purchased Zumba (from Craigslist) which I do every now and then, but I've found I like the Walking DVD best. Best $10 I've spent at WalMart. Yesterday I did a two mile walk in the comfort of my front room. The video is a 5 mile video and I'm working my way up to the five miles. But 30 minutes and 2 miles is a great start and doable in my schedule.
Dragonflower says,Yes, MO, you told me that before and that's s what got me to thinking....I'm lucky I don't have the weather to contend with like you so I can get out and walk most every day. I used to until "people" started making me feel that wasn't god enough. That's my own interpretation-they really are just trying to be helpful.
Thanks again for your encouragement! I feel better now and more myself.
Dragonflower says,*good enough*
MotorCityMich says,I totally understand and sympathize. I've only found one group exercise class that I felt comfortable with, but I'd still prefer not to embarrass myself with a bunch of people who are more fit than I am. I need to get back on the exercise/movement kick, but it's hard... especially since I feel so much further behind anyone else and have a lot more to do than they do. *hugs*
Layne says,I don't think theres anything wrong with exercising by yourself. I'm the gym class hero. The girl that gets the ball passed to; the one with the touchdown dance. I wasnt always athletic though. I had a long awkward phase where I feared gym class. I got involved in sports around seventh grade, and things got better from there. But still, I try to help the kids that probably feel how you did; give them an easy pass to help them stay included. Nobody likes watching something happen around them but not knowing how to jump in. I know what thats like. Even now that I'm used to the group participation, I still like being on my own sometimes. I run on the weekends by myself, and it gives me a chance to catch up with everything thats going on and just get out of my own head for a while. Sometimes thats even more beneficial than group training. So kudos to you DE! And remember, no matter what, even if your just going for a walk you're still improving more than the person sitting on the couch at home:)
Dragonflower says,Thank you, Layne! You really do understand. You are sonice to help out the kids who aren't as physically inclined! If someone had done that for me, it would have helped so much. I used to love to play basketball and was good at free throws,but the inyourface thing was not me. The gym teacher would then put me somewhere where I had little activity so I wouldn't mess up the game. That didn't help anything! Yay for you for being so kind and not all ego driven.
I was doing just fine and feeling proud of myself for my strength and weight loss until my "authority figures" started pushing me to group exercise. Then I felt stupid again and clumsy. So I went for walk today and feel happy again. I'm healthy and take no medications and eat well.
Thanks for the support! We're back in business, as my father used to say!

Turtwig seems like an odd choice when considering how little it has to offer in the new generation. Even with its acceptable Attack stat and defenses, its low Speed and poor coverage tend to be its downfall. The introduction of Eviolite also severely weakened its offensive capability by making many of its enemies more difficult to take down. However, not all is lost for this unfortunate turtle, as it retains its role as the only Grass-type in Little Cup that can set up both Stealth Rock and dual screens. Without many new options to utilize, Turtwig has much trouble finding its way on a team in the BW Little Cup metagame.
With its unique ability to set up both dual screens and Stealth Rock, Turtwig is capable of being an effective team supporter. The goal of this set is to set up dual screens, and then to set up Stealth Rock. Though this will cost one turn of dual screens, this ensures that faster enemies will have a more difficult time taking Turtwig down before it lays down its entry hazard. The last slot is reserved for Turtwig's one offensive move, to prevent it from being shut down by Taunt. Seed Bomb is Turtwig's only decent STAB move on the physical side, but Hidden Power Fire is useful to deal with Cottonee.
If Turtwig has Hidden Power Fire, a Bold or Calm nature is a better option because without Seed Bomb, Turtwig has no use for its Attack stat. Eviolite is an option over Light Clay to give Turtwig more bulk, but it comes with the disadvantage of reducing the Reflect and Light Screen's duration. Turtwig can also make use of Hidden Power Ice to hit Dragon- and Flying-types, including Gligar.
Cottonee is perhaps the biggest threat to this set because it can come in at any time and stop Turtwig in its tracks with priority Taunt and Toxic, or even with Hidden Power Fire. Snover makes an excellent teammate in this department to scare away Cottonee, but Cottonee isn't as common as it used to be. Brick Break users are problematic, but the most common one, Pawniard, can be countered with a strong Fighting-type such as Mienfoo or Timburr. Sweepers like Clamperl also make good partners, as under dual screens and with Stealth Rock in play they can be very frightening.
Turtwig has a variety of options, but few can be utilized effectively. Like many Grass-types, Turtwig is capable of using SubSeed, but just like most of the others, it is outclassed by Cottonee and Ferroseed. Turtwig also has access to Growth, Curse, and Swords Dance, but cannot put them to much use due to its poor movepool. A support set with Stockpile is a decent alternative, but Turtwig has few other options to use with it. Giga Drain and Synthesis provide recovery, but without enough bulk to take more than a few hits outside of dual screens, these moves are rendered inefficient. A RestTalk or Trick Room set could be a good option if Turtwig didn't have so little to offer with its unboosted attacks in a metagame filled with so many Eviolite users.
Even under dual screens, it isn't very difficult to find a counter to Turtwig. Anything that can take a Seed Bomb or Hidden Power Fire and strike back with a super effective move is capable of checking Turtwig, but there are a few that get special mention. Again, Cottonee stops Turtwig with priority Taunt and Toxic and is at worst 2HKOed by Hidden Power Fire due to Turtwig's low Special Attack stat. Scraggy is bulky enough to take a Seed Bomb or Hidden Power Fire and set up while recovering back HP with Drain Punch. Pawniard can shatter dual screens and scare out Ghost-types that might switch in to take a Brick Break. Rapid Spinners such as Tentacool and Staryu resist Hidden Power Fire and can remove Stealth Rock, but must watch out for Seed Bomb.
Turtwig's Dream World ability is Shell Armor, which stops critical hits, but like all starters, it only comes on a level 10 male, so it is illegal in Little Cup.

I am sure there was a ‘confidentiality clause’ in the settlement to keep the public from knowing who knew what and when they knew it. The catholic church will comply when the laws are changed and a Window opened for Victims !

Unfortunatetly if they settle they get away again, they all need to go to trial….I admire all victims who have the courage to come forward and hope that we all can come together in our steps toward justice and healing……zero tolerance for these abusers, we must bring them to trial!! Hell, even like the Philidelphia Judge wanted to do, get all of them together to stand trial…

Thank you, Ms. Dorris for your posting of 3 more problematic papal candidates. I wish it could be safe for you to just say, "these cardinals in particular, should not be made pope". I understand why you haven't, but that is exactly part of what the catholic church heirarchy must change. The new Pope must be able to fight for and ensure freedom of speech and open public opinion and public action regarding past heinous crimes perpetrated by Catholic prelates; wherever it was that they worked and lived. So, I will say it for you: Dear members of the conclave, DO NOT ELECT any of the 12 priests first named by Survivors Network of Priest Abuse last week, nor any of the 3 priests named today, March 12, 2013.
Thank you for staying in Rome at this critical juncture. I only wish you did not have to leave this week. I am grateful that Mr. Clohessy will be able to stay longer, but do wish that you both and your co-traveler, worker whose name escapes me at this moment, as well.
I don't care if the American news commentator who isn't even Catholic, says that now it is no longer time for discussion, only just to vote, as the cardinals proceed into the Sistine Chapel for the conclave to begin. In fact, I pray that the cardinals in the conclave will indeed discuss everything currently involved in this challenge. And, I pray that each of you will continue to speak, NOW. I believe you will be heard now, by more people and God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit better now, than ever before!!! YOUR PLEAS WILL BE HEARD IF YOU CONTINUE TO SPEAK THEM NOW. The time is right.

Barbara, we've been in touch occasionally in the past. Until now I have not wanted to take any type of legal action against the Catholic Church. My Bishop and my diocese continues to be supportive. My case was sent to the CDF after my diocese and its council found it credible. My abuser was from India, going to school here, and it was back in 1973-74. My diocese published information in local bulletins asking others to step forward no one did. No surprise, it was known he and I were "good friends". then he went back to India. I found him again in the US several years ago leading a Syro-Malabar Mission out in CA. It was at that time I was ready to make a formal complain to the church and the Benton Harbor, MI police Dept. where the repeated abuse occurred. Obviously statute of limitations prohibited any legal action at this time, but it made my case more credible for the the church.
The CDF came back to us with a letter that basically said:
1. Since it was so long ago, and
2. I was the only person who has spoken up against this man
3. His Bishop was contacted in India (Bishop Moolakat) and told the CDF Fr. Jacob Vellian was elderly, retired and NOT involved in active ministry, so he was no longer a threat.
(NOTE: When our Diocese notified HIS diocese in CA they said he was in India on vacation, but would put him on immediate leave of absence when he got back. He then decided he was going to retire, and stayed in India and never came back to the USA! What a coincidence!)
4. therefore the CDF ruled that as a "penance" Fr. Jacob Vellian was to say a mass every Friday for the victims of sexual abuse. (GAG!)
Well, since then I have found a picture of him on THEIR diocese website actively performing public ministry. I also found that about 6 months ago he appears to be planning on coming to the US to Orlando FL for a Syro-Malabar gathering. When our Bishop's office contacted his Bishops office they said oh they didn't think he could make the trip. (It appeared his name was on the program at that time.) Our Bishops office called AGAIN and they confirmed he would NOT be coming, his name was on the program just because he had in the passed directed this group of singers that would be singing.
Well, after finding this link with him obviously in good health and performing ministry, I am pissed and wounded enough about his Bishop lying to the CDF and the CDF not following up on the Bishop's lies. I'm wondering what my chance are to sue, as a civil suit Bishop Moolakat, Fr. Jacob Vellian, and his ArchDiocese in India for misrepresenting to the CDF the situation.
I want to underscore my diocese as been very helpful and supportive, but must follow the cannon law, or whatever code they have to follow. I'm sick and tired of tracking this guy and having his Bishop cover his butt and lie to everyone. I'm still in counseling and had left the catholic church but came back after some healing. But want this guy stopped for performing ministry!

A Month at St. Thomas Aquinas
Our school has been quite busy this month, with holding a volleyball tournament to having an all day wood turning course; it has brought all of us together as a school community while heading towards the end of the year. The Volleyball tournament raised money to help build a school, in Sri Lanka through “Me to We” a children helping children organization. We also had the Kawartha Wood Turners Guild come to Mr. Saunders Woodshop classes. They taught the students how to make things like: bowls, chair legs, vases etc. out of wood.

St. Norbert Finishes 53rd in NCAA Division III Learfield Sports Directors' Cup
From Sports Information Director, June 7, 2012 |
by Dan Lukes, dan.lukes@snc.edu, (920) 403-4077
The Green Knights totaled 313.5 points during the 2011-12 academic year, the best finish this year for a Midwest Conference school. Points are accumulated in each sport by qualifying and placing in the NCAA Division III Tournament. Middlebury (Vt.) College won this year's Directors' Cup with 1,040.75 points. A total of 318 Division III schools scored points in this year's Directors' Cup standings.
"This was another great year for St. Norbert athletics, including national champions in men's ice hockey and two track individuals in Emily Schudrowitz and Justin Johnson," St. Norbert athletics director Tim Bald said. "Our student-athletes and staff work hard to be successful and have a quality experience."
St. Norbert's performance this past year marked the seventh time in the past eight years it has placed among the top 100 Division III schools nationally. The Green Knights placed a school-best 35th in 2009-10 with 401 points.
Men's ice hockey's national championship in the NCAA Tournament gave the Green Knights a total of 100 points, the most a single sport can earn. Women's outdoor track and field tallied 51.5 points. Baseball earned 50 points, while outdoor men's track and field earned 47 points. Women's softball and women's volleyball both earned 25 points, while indoor women's track and field earned 15 points.

In an interview with Michigan Radio, SNRE Associate Professor Brad Cardinale talks about biodiversity in the context of a bill in the Michigan Legislature.
The story by Rebecca William discusses a bill introduced by state Sen. Tom Casperson-R (Escanaba) that would prohibit the the state Department of Natural Resources from setting aside an area of land specifically for the purpose of maintaining biological diversity (basically, to protect the variety of plants and animals that live in an area), according to the Michigan Radio story.
SNRE Professor Rosina M. Bierbaum discusses the recently released National Climate Assessment draft report with Cynthia Canty of Michigan Radio. Bierbaum of SNRE and the School of Public Health was a lead convening author of the chapter on climate change adaptation.

Yorke wants to see pride in T&T football

- Hits: 1067
Former national football captain Dwight Yorke wants to see some pride restored in local football and is hoping that the Football Federation can resolve some of the issues currently plaguing the progress of this country on the international football stage.
Yorke was speaking in Barbados on the weekend where he led Manchester United to the British Airways Legends title at the Kensington Oval.
He teamed up with Andy Cole to help United defeat Chelsea in the final as well as a semi-final win over the Caribbean All Stars which included the likes of Russell Latapy, Stern John, Dennis Lawrence, Clayton Ince, Dion Burton and Paul Hall. “It’s very sad to see where football is at this point in time.
There are a lot of issues going on with the Federation and they need to sort it out,” Yorke said. The ex-Aston Villa marksman said it was undoubtedly disappointing to see T&T out of the World Cup picture so early in the 2014 campaign particularly after appearing on the big stage in 2006.
Yorke is currently a Manchester United ambassador and an analyst for Sky Sports. He has been a member of the United Reserve team coaching staff while also completing some of his coaching badges.
He maintained he would be willing to contribute to the development of local football at some stage. “I’m now part of the Sky Sports team as well as an ambassador for Manchester United and also doing completing some more coaching badges.
I’m just keeping active and enjoying what I’m doing at the moment. “I’ve been very grateful for Trinidad football for many years. It’s been part of me and I’ve been very fortunate to play a role and learn so much in the game. I feel with my experience and knowledge I have gained over the years that I can always contribute something back to the Football Federation.
“My name will be mentioned because of what I have done and maybe one day that opportunity will come along where I will step back in in terms of contributing and giving back something to the football. It would be rude of me not to really consider it if it was to happen. At the moment where our football is, some issues need to be resolved before we can even get to that,” Yorke added.

By FRANCO PANIZO
When goalkeeper Chris Blais' 2010 season came to a close, it did so a game earlier than he wanted. Blais had helped guide Michigan to an impressive run in the NCAA Championship tournament, one that ended with a semifinals loss to eventual champion Akron.
As surprising as that run may have been to some fans across the nation, it compared little to what Blais did next.
This past June, Blais made the unique decision of leaving the only program he had ever played for by transferring as a senior to the University of South Florida. He was saying goodbye to the place he had called home the previous four years and his starting spot to begin a new chapter in his career with a team that had been knocked out of the 2010 NCAA tournament in the first round.
"There was a lot of stuff that happened, to be honest," the 6-foot-4, 195-pound Blais said of his decision to transfer. "One of the big things that brought me here was the goalkeeper coach, Bryheem Hancock. With his experience playing pro and (being) an All-American (who) won a national championship at UConn, he was a major, major reason for me making the move."
But that wasn't the only factor in Blais' departure from Michigan.
"There was a lot of turnover with players and coaches," said Blais. "The coach that recruited me at Michigan took a head coaching job somewhere else, the goalie coach took a head coaching job somewhere else, and Soony (Saad) and Justin (Meram) leaving to go pro, and then our two best recruits coming in ended up going pro, so it just didn't seem like the right situation. I was there the whole spring and after everything that had happened with all the turnover, it just didn't seem like the right place for me anymore."
Blais, who initiated contact by emailing Bulls head coach George Kiefer via email, also chose the Bulls due to their reputation for being a good goalkeeper factory, having produced top college players like Jeff Attinella and Diego Restrepo at the position in the past.
After Kiefer decided to bring Blais in, the experienced goalkeeper knew things were about to change quickly. Blais also realized he'd have to adapt fast to his new surroundings if he wanted to win the starting spot and enjoy a successful final year in college soccer.
The Seattle, Wash., native did just that, beating out sophomore Eric Osswald and freshman Dallas Jaye while also jelling with his new teammates on and off the field.
"He's got a great personality," said Kiefer. "He fits in excellent with the guys. The guys call him grandpa. He's a fifth year guy. I think with any good team, once they recognize you have talent they figure out a way to fit you in.
Blais' time with USF has been brief, but he is already seeing the similarities and differences that his new home has compared to his old one.
One of the biggest things he has already noticed is how much attention the University of South Florida pays to its soccer program, a welcomed dissimilarity for Blais.
"I think soccer is one of the bigger sports here and at Michigan it's not," said Blais. "It's still big (there), but it's not one of the main sports. Like football and hockey and basketball really dominate everything there, and it's kind of been cool experiencing that because I always kind of felt that we were like second best, like a team that flew under the radar at Michigan and here I feel like soccer is really in the forefront. So being a college soccer player, that's something that's a good thing to have."
Another difference that Blais was going to have to get accustomed to was not being a captain anymore. With the Wolverines, Blais was known as one of the defacto leaders. But with the Bulls, he was the new guy in town.
That still didn't stop Kiefer and his coaching staff from wanting Blais to take a leadership role on the team, albeit slowly but surely.
"If he came in right away and tried to lead, I don't think the group would have accepted him," said Kiefer. "But now that he's got some games under his belt; he's been masterful at that, actually. He's been very good at figuriing out at when to push and when to slow down."
Blais' leadership roles and abilities were put to the test against a talented opponent in Wake Forest in the season opener on Aug. 27, a game that came little over two months after Blais had announced his transfer from Michigan.
Blais had a good performance that day, making seven saves en route to helping the Bulls win 2-0. That outing was good enough to also earn him the Big East Goalkeeper of the Week award.
He followed his impressive debut by recording another shutout days later in a 1-0 victory over Georgia State.
"Shutouts are really an expectation here more than just something that happens," said Blais.
Blais adds that he was not surprised that he and the team could put together such performances so quickly, and he partially attributes that to the ease of his transition to USF.
"It takes time to build your back line, but I think me and my back line have gotten along really well and guys are starting to get used to how I play and get used to the kind of person I am," said Blais. "But like I said, it's went better than I thought it was going to be, but it's not perfect.
With his size and skills, Blais is already a pro prospect and Kiefer says MLS scouts from three or four teams have already attended games to keep an eye on the Bulls' starting goalkeeper and his teammates.
Blais has already trained in professional environments, having spent at least a week with the Seattle Sounders for each of the past four summers. He has also trained with the Vancouver Whitecaps and U.S. men's national team goalkeeper Tim Howard.
But he isn't thinking that far ahead, and is rather focusing on his final collegiate season. When pressed on the issue, however, Blais admits he doesn't have a preference between MLS, Europe or elsewhere.
"I feel like wherever the best situation with the best coach (is best) because goalies usually their prime is much later," said Blais. "Obviously I'd love to be in Seattle some day but that's if the stars all align the right way.
"If I get a chance in Europe, I'd love to go do that. If I get a chance at MLS, I'd love to go do that. I just really want it to be the right situation, the right coach and then you work hard and hopefully some day get a shot at the starting job."
There was a time when “USF” in reference to college soccer meant University San Francisco – unfortunately, those days of national championships are long gone, and don’t appear to be on the horizon anytime soon.
the guy transferred because he lost teammates and coaches? sounds like he has an attitude problem, and is not a team player.
but really, who cares, its college soccer
haha yeah its not like Clint Dempsey, Holden, Edu, Bocanegra, Onyewu, Cherundolo, Subotic, Nielsen or Ibesevic ever played college. Oh wait they did. Fabregas did the same thing as Blais got a proble with that?
In basketball or football for example, you have to sit out a season while transferring. I figured that was an NCAA thing. Why didn’t this guy have to sit out? Am I just wrong?
Why didn’t he have to sit out a season? Isn’t that the NCAA rule to keep players from just jumping from program to program if they’re not happy where they are?!
If he graduated from UM last year and he switched to grad program at USF that UM does not have, he doesnt have to sit.
So he went to UM to help build the program. They got good and everyone else jumped ship for greener pastures. Whats wrong with him doing the same?
If you’d read or watched any of the interviews with this kid you’d know he has nothing close to an attitude problem. He spent 3 years building the program at Michigan, and when all of his own coaches and team mates left, and the program looked dismal, why should he have to stay for a mediocre final season and possibly lose his chance to go pro? This kid is smart. Soccer is his business and sounds like he made a good business investment in USF
I believe transfer rules are different for different sports. I don’t think sitting a year is required for baseball or soccer as long as the school they are leaving gives them a release; most do, especially if out of conference.
Nice to see a player transferring INTO South Florida and not OUT OF. If you took all the guys that have transferred out of Keifer’s program at USF and made a team out of them, you prob would have a National Championship squad.
Like who???
As a Seattle native and USF Alumnus, I’m very proud to be pulling for Blais. I would love to see the Sounders draft and develop him while acting as a back up. SSFC already passed on Jeff Attinella last year, and Attinella is getting all sorts of honors in USL (NASL?).
Right off the top of my head Tony Taylor (plays professionally in Portugal), Rodrigo Hidalgo (former YNT member) and Diego Restrepo (won it all with Virginia, playing pro in South America).

Argentina Soccer Jersey
There are no products matching the selection.
History of Argentina Jerseys
One of the most recognizable kits in international soccer is the Argentina Home kit, with signature light blue and white vertical stripes just like in the Argentina national flag. Their fitting nickname La Albiceleste meaning the White & Sky Blue has represented the club since their formation in the early 1900s. Since then Argentina has enjoyed a long history of success, including two World Cups. Their away kit has typically been a solid blue top, sometimes with light blue accents. With historical greats like Javier Zanetti and modern marvels like Leo Messi, the Argentina Jersey continues to be one of international fame.

Bayer Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voller says the club made the right decision in keeping hold of Andre Schurrle.
Chelsea were reportedly chasing Germany international Schurrle in the off-season, and reportedly had a 16 million-pound offer rejected.
Bundesliga side Leverkusen held on to their star attacker, but Voller knows the chase to prise Schurrle away from the BayArena is likely to resume.
“At his level there will be always requests, not only by Chelsea,” he told Bild.
“But we take it easy.
“It was the right decision not to have sold Schurrle before (the) season.”
Another one of the club’s top performers who has been impressing of late is right-back Dani Carvajal, who joined Leverkusen from Real Madrid’s youth system in the off-season. said.
“But I don’t think it’ll happen next summer. Hopefully we will enjoy him for more time.”
Following the winter break, Leverkusen face Benfica in the Europa League knockout stages, with the first leg taking place in Germany on February 14.
Voller admitted it is a tricky tie, but hopes Leverkusen can go far in the competition.
He also believes the Bundesliga is represented well in the Champions League, picking out Bayern Munich as one of the favourites.
“With Benfica we have a tough opponent,” he said.
“But we want to stay in (the) competition (for) as long as possible.
“Dortmund has (a) chance in (the) Champions League. But my favourites are Barcelona and Bayern.”

Chapter Contents
Design and Methodology: American Community Survey
A corporate entity established to conduct both business and nonprofit affairs of Alaska Natives, pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1972 (Public Law 92-203, as amended). Twelve ANRCs are legally bounded geographic entities that cover Alaska, except for the Annette Islands Reserve (an American Indian reservation). A thirteenth ANRC represents Alaska Natives who do not live in Alaska and do not identify with any of the 12 corporations; the U.S. Census Bureau does not present data for this ANRC.
Alaska Native village (ANV)
A local governmental unit in Alaska that constitutes an association, band, clan, community, group, tribe, or village, recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1972 (Public Law 92-203, as amended). ANVs do not have clearly defined boundaries that are easily locatable, and they often include many square miles of land used by Alaska Natives for hunting and fishing, so the U.S. Census Bureau works with officials of the Alaska Native villages and Alaska Native Regional Corporations to delineate Alaska Native village statistical areas for data presentation purposes.
Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA)
A statistical entity that represents the settled portion of an Alaska Native village for data presentation purposes.
American Indian off-reservation trust land
The United States holds title for specific area in trust for the benefit of an American Indian tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual American Indian (individual trust land). Although trust land may be located on or off a reservation, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data only for off-reservation trust land. Census data always associate off-reservation trust land with a specific federally recognized reservation and/or tribal government. See American Indian reservation, American Indian trust land.
American Indian reservation
A federal American Indian reservation is an area that has been set aside by the United States for the use of one or more federally recognized American Indian tribes. Together with off-reservation trust land, a reservation covers territory over which one or more tribes have primary governmental authority. The boundary of a federal reservation is defined by tribal treaty, agreement, executive or secretarial order, federal statute, or judicial determination. A state American Indian reservation is an area that a state government has allocated to a tribe recognized by that state, but not by the federal government. American Indian reservations are known as colonies, communities, Indian communities, Indian villages, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, and villages. See American Indian off-reservation trust land, American Indian tribal subdivision, American Indian trust land, joint use area.
American Indian tribal subdivision
A legal subdivision of a federally recognized American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, or Oklahoma tribal statistical area. These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for American Indians living on a reservation, off-reservation trust land, or Oklahoma tribal statistical area. Tribal subdivisions are known as areas, chapters, communities, districts, and segments. The U.S. Census Bureau previously provided unpublished data for these entities for the 1980 census, which referred to them as American Indian subreservation areas.
American Indian trust land
An area for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of an American Indian tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual American Indian (individual trust land). Trust land may be located on or off a reservation; however, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data only for off-reservation trust land. See American Indian off-reservation trust land, Hawaiian home land.
Barrio, barrio-pueblo Census Bureau presents the same types of Census 2000 data for these "sub-MCDs" as it does for the barrios and barrios-pueblo. Each barrio, barrio-pueblo, and subbarrio is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within Puerto Rico. See subbarrio.
Block
See census block
Block boundary
The features that delimit a census block. The features may be visible (a street, road, stream, shoreline, power line, etc.) or invisible (a county line, city limit, property line, imaginary extension of a street or road, etc.). Generally, the boundary of a census block must include at least one addressable feature; that is, a street or road. For data tabulation, the boundary of every legal and statistical entity recognized in the U.S. Census Bureau's standard data tabulations is a block boundary.
Block group (BG)
A statistical subdivision of a census tract (or, prior to Census 2000, a block numbering area). A BG consists of all tabulation blocks whose numbers begin with the same digit in a census tract. For example, for Census 2000, BG 3 within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. (A few BGs consist of a single block.) BGs generally contain between 300 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. The BG is the lowest-level geographic entity for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulates sample data from a decennial census. See tribal block group.
Block number
A number assigned to each census block.
*.
Block numbering area (BNA)
Prior to Census 2000, a statistical subdivision of a county or statistically equivalent entity, delineated by a state government agency or a U.S. Census Bureau regional census center for the purpose of grouping and numbering census blocks in counties that did not have census tracts. BNAs were discontinued for Census 2000; they were replaced by census tracts in every county and statistically equivalent entity.
Borough
A legally established geographic entity in Alaska, which the Census Bureau treats as statistically equivalent to a county in other states; a minor civil division in each of the five counties that comprise New York city; a type of incorporated place in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.
Census area
A statistical entity that serves as the equivalent of a county in Alaska. Census areas are delineated cooperatively by the state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau for the purpose of presenting census data for the portion of Alaska not within an organized borough, city and borough, or municipality.
Census block
A geographic area bounded by visible and/or invisible features shown on a map prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau. A block is the smallest geographic entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates decennial census data. See block boundary, block number.
Census Bureau map
Any map, in electronic or paper form, produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. Such a map usually displays the boundaries and names and/or codes of the geographic entities that the Census Bureau uses to take a census or survey, or for which the Census Bureau tabulates data, and may include both visible and invisible features, feature names, and other information appropriate to the purpose for which the map was prepared. Some Census Bureau maps display statistical data in various thematic forms. Every Census Bureau map displays a credit note showing that it was produced by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Census county division (CCD)
A statistical subdivision of a county, established and delineated cooperatively by the U.S. Census Bureau and state, local, and tribal officials for data presentation purposes. CCDs have been established in 21 states that do not have minor civil divisions suitable for data presentation; that is, minor civil divisions have not been legally established, do not have governmental or administrative purposes, have boundaries that are ambiguous or change frequently, and/or generally are not well known to the public.
Census designated place (CDP)
A geographic entity that serves as the statistical counterpart of an incorporated place for the purpose of presenting census data for an area with a concentration of population, housing, and commercial structures that is identifiable by name, but is not within an incorporated place. CDPs usually are delineated cooperatively with state, Puerto Rico, Island Area, local, and tribal officials based on U.S. Census Bureau guidelines. For Census 2000, for the first time, CDPs did not need to meet a minimum population threshold to qualify for the tabulation of census data. See place. Note: A CDP in Puerto Rico is called a comunidad or zona urbana.
Census division
A grouping of states and the District of Columbia, established by the U.S. Census Bureau for the presentation of census data. The nine divisions represent areas that were relatively homogeneous when they were established in 1910. The divisions are subdivisions of the four census regions.
Census geography
A collective term referring to the geographic entities used by the U.S. Census Bureau in its data collection and tabulation operations, including their relationships to one another. See geographic hierarchy, tabulation geography.
Census map
See Census Bureau map.
Census region
A grouping of states and the District of Columbia, established by the U.S. Census Bureau for the presentation of census data. The four regions represent areas that were relatively homogeneous when they were established in 1910 and revised in 1950. Each region is divided into two or three census divisions.
Census subarea
A statistical subdivision of a borough, census area, or other entity that is the statistical equivalent of a county in Alaska. A census subarea is similar to a census county division in other states. Census subareas are delineated cooperatively by the state of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau.
Census tract
A small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a county or statistically equivalent entity, delineated for data presentation purposes by a local group of census data users or the geographic staff of a regional census center in accordance with U.S. Census Bureau guidelines. Designed to be relatively homogeneous units with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions at the time they are established, census tracts generally contain between 1,000 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being stable over many decades, so they generally follow relatively permanent visible features. However, they may follow governmental unit boundaries and other invisible features in some instances; the boundary of a state or county (or statistically equivalent entity) is always a census tract boundary. When data are provided for American Indian entities, the boundary of a federally recognized American Indian reservation and off-reservation trust land is always the boundary of a tribal census tract. See block numbering area, tribal census tract.
Census tract number
A 4-digit number, which may be followed by a 2-digit decimal suffix, used to identify a census tract uniquely within a county or statistically equivalent entity. For Census 2000, census tract numbers range from 0001 to 9999, with 9400 to 9499 reserved for census tracts related to federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land - primarily reservations and trust land that cross county lines. Leading zeros and a suffix of ".00" usually do not appear on maps prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau, and are not commonly used when referring to a particular census tract. The number "0000" in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.
Central city
In a metropolitan area, the largest place and, in some areas, one or more additional places that meet official standards. A few primary metropolitan statistical areas do not have a central city.
Central place
In an urbanized area or urban cluster, the largest incorporated place, or census designated place in some cases, and one or more additional places that meet specific criteria. For an urbanized area or urban cluster that does not contain an incorporated or census designated place, there is no central place (the title of the urbanized area or urban cluster uses the name of a minor civil division, or a local place name recognized by the Board on Geographic Names and recorded by the U.S. Geological Survey, but the name does not represent a central place).
City
A type of incorporated place in all states and the District of Columbia. In agreement with the state of Hawaii, the U.S. Census Bureau does not recognize the city of Honolulu for presentation of census data. In Virginia, all cities are not part of any county, and so the Census Bureau treats them as equivalent to a county for data presentation purposes, as well as treating them as places; there also is one such independent city in each of three states: Maryland, Missouri, and Nevada. In 23 states and the District of Columbia, some or all cities are not part of any minor civil division, in which case the Census Bureau treats them as county subdivisions as well as places for data presentation purposes.
City and borough
A legally established geographic entity in Alaska, which the U.S. Census Bureau treats as the statistical equivalent of a county in other states; also, a type of incorporated place in Alaska. This designation is new for Census 2000.
Code
See geographic code.
Collection block
The smallest area that the U.S. Census Bureau used to collect information for the decennial census. A collection block may be split by the boundary of any legal or statistical entity later recognized by the Census Bureau for census data presentation. Thus, if a collection block is split by one or more legal and/or statistical boundaries, each portion will be a separate tabulation block; if a collection block is not split, the same area may be a tabulation block. See block number, census block, tabulation block.
Comunidad
A census designated place in Puerto Rico that is not related to a municipio's seat of government. See census designated place, zona urbana.
Congressional district (CD)
One of the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. The CDs for which Census 2000 first provides data are those for the 106th Congress.
Consolidated city
The U.S. Census Bureau refers to a governmental unit for which the functions of an incorporated place and its county or minor civil division have merged as a consolidated government. If one or more other incorporated places continue to function as separate governmental units even though they are part of a consolidated government, the Census Bureau refers to the primary incorporated place as a consolidated city.
Consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA)
A geographic entity designated by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical agencies. An area becomes a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) if it qualifies as a metropolitan area (MA), has a census population of 1,000,000 or more, has component parts that qualify as primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) based on official standards, and local opinion favors the designation. CMSAs consist of whole counties except in New England, where they consist of county subdivisions (primarily cities and towns). See central city, metropolitan area, metropolitan statistical area, New England County Metropolitan Area, primary metropolitan statistical area, statistical entity.
County
The primary legal division of every state except Alaska and Louisiana. A number of geographic entities are not legally designated as a county, but are recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau as equivalent to a county for data presentation purposes. These include the boroughs, city and boroughs, municipality, and census areas in Alaska; parishes in Louisiana; and cities that are independent of any county in Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia. They also include the municipios in Puerto Rico, districts and islands in American Samoa, municipalities in the Northern Mariana Islands, and islands in the Virgin Islands of the United States. Because they contain no primary legal divisions, the Census Bureau treats the District of Columbia and Guam each as equivalent to a county (as well as equivalent to a state) for data presentation purposes. In American Samoa, a county is a minor civil division.
County subdivision
The primary legal or statistical division of a county or statistically equivalent entity. See census county division, census subarea, minor civil division, unorganized territory.
Division (census geographic)
See census division.
Extended city
See extended place.
Extended place
A place that contains both urban and rural territory; i.e., an incorporated place or census designated place that is partially within and partially outside of an urbanized area or urban cluster. The term is first used for Census 2000. Previously referred to as an extended city, which applied only to incorporated places, subject to very specific criteria.
Geographic code
A code, consisting of one or more alphanumeric or special-text characters, used to identify a geographic entity. Every geographic entity recognized by the Census Bureau is assigned one or more geographic codes. Also referred to as a geocode.
Geographic entity
A spatial unit of any type, legal or statistical, such as the United States, a state, county, county subdivision, place, census tract, block group, or census block. See census geography, legal entity, statistical entity.
Geographic hierarchy
A geographic presentation that shows the geographic entities in a superior/subordinate structure. In this system of relationships among geographic entities, each entity (except the smallest one) is subdivided into lower-order units that in turn may be subdivided further. For example, states are subdivided into counties, which are subdivided into both county subdivisions and census tracts. The Census Bureau uses three sets of hierarchies: one is based on states and counties; another on American Indian area, Alaska Native areas, and Hawaiian home lands; and a third on metropolitan or urban areas. See census geography, tabulation geography.
Governmental unit (GU)
A geographic entity established by legal action for the purpose of implementing specified general- or special-purpose governmental functions. Most GUs have legally established boundaries and names, and have officials (usually elected) who have the power to carry out legally prescribed functions, provide services for the residents of the GU, and raise revenues. Some GUs do not have officials or do not implement the powers that the law entitles them to; the U.S. Census Bureau refers to these entities as inactive governmental units.
Hawaiian home land (HHL)
An area held in trust for the benefit of native Hawaiians by the state of Hawaii, pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, as amended. Hawaiian home lands are a new type of geographic entity for Census 2000.
Incorporated place
A type of governmental unit, incorporated under state law as a city, town (except in New England, New York, and Wisconsin), borough (except in Alaska and New York), or village, generally to provide a wide array of specific governmental services for a concentration of people within legally prescribed boundaries. New for Census 2000 are "city and borough" and "municipality," which serve as both place- and county-level entities in Alaska. A few incorporated places do not have a legal description. See consolidated city, governmental unit, independent city, independent place, place.
Independent city
An incorporated place that is independent of - i.e., not part of - any county. All incorporated places classified as cities in Virginia are independent cities, as are Baltimore, MD; St. Louis, MO; and Carson City, NV. The U.S. Census Bureau treats an independent city as equivalent to a county and, where appropriate, as a county subdivision and as an incorporated place for data presentation purposes.
Independent place
In a state in which the Census Bureau recognizes minor civil divisions (MCDs), an incorporated place that is not legally part of any MCD. The Census Bureau treats an independent place as equivalent to a county subdivision and as an incorporated place for data presentation purposes. Independent places exist in 23 states and the District of Columbia.
Indian reservation
See American Indian reservation.
Island Areas
For Census 2000, several legal entities under the jurisdiction of the United States: American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau treats these entities as equivalent to states for data presentation purposes. The term also includes several small islands in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean; the Census Bureau provides only population counts for these "U.S. Minor Outlying Islands," based on records obtained from the government agency that administers each island (most are unpopulated). Formerly referred to as the Outlying Areas.
Joint use area
Territory that is administered, claimed, and/or used by two or more American Indian tribes. It may consist of an overlap of territory of adjoining American Indian reservations or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas, or off-reservation trust land for one tribe that is located within the reservation of another tribe. Such territory was referred to as joint area for the 1990 census.
Legal entity
A geographic entity whose origin, boundary, name, and description result from charters, laws, treaties, or other administrative or governmental action, including the United States; the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas; counties and statistically equivalent legal entities; minor civil divisions; incorporated places, including consolidated cities; American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust land, and tribal subdivisions; Alaska Native Regional Corporations; Hawaiian home lands; congressional districts; state legislative districts; most voting districts; and school districts. Some legal entities, such as Hawaiian home lands, congressional districts, and voting districts, have no governmental officials or powers, but serve only as nonfunctioning administrative entities. The legal entities and their boundaries that the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes for Census 2000 are those that existed on January 1, 2000. See governmental unit, statistical entity.
Metropolitan area (MA)
A core areas with a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that core. (Some MAs are defined around two or more nuclei.) MAs are designated by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in terms of one or more counties or, in New England, county subdivisions (primarily cities and towns). The OMB defines and designates metropolitan areas based on a set of official standards that are published in the Federal Register. "Metropolitan area" is a collective term established by the OMB in 1990 to refer to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSAs), primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs), and New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs).
Note: In 2003, a new set of standards will go into effect, creating several new types of statistical entities and renaming others, and discontinuing the term "metropolitan area."
Note: In 2003, a new set of standards will go into effect, creating several new types of statistical entities and renaming others, and discontinuing the term "metropolitan area."
Metropolitan statistical area (MSA)
A geographic entity designated by the federal Office of Management and Budget for use by federal statistical agencies. A metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a metropolitan area (MA) that is not closely associated with another MA. An MSA consists of one or more counties, except in New England, where MSAs are defined in terms of county subdivisions (primarily cities and towns). See central city, consolidated metropolitan statistical area, metropolitan area, New England County Metropolitan Area, primary metropolitan statistical area, statistical entity.
Minor civil division (MCD)
A type of governmental unit that is the primary governmental or administrative division of a county or statistically equivalent entity in many states and statistically equivalent entities. MCDs are identified by a variety of terms, such as township, town (in eight states), or district. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in 28 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. In 20 states and American Samoa, all or many MCDs are active general-purpose governmental units. Many MCDs are not general-purpose governmental units, and therefore do not have elected officials to carry out legal functions; instead, they serve as nonfunctioning administrative entities. See county subdivision, governmental unit, independent place, legal entity.
Municipality
A legally established entity in Alaska and the Northern Mariana Islands. The U.S. Census Bureau treats this entity as the statistical equivalent of a county, and the Census Bureau also treats the municipality (Anchorage) in Alaska as an incorporated place. This designation in Alaska is new for Census 2000.
Municipio
A governmental unit that is the primary legal division of Puerto Rico. The U.S. Census Bureau treats a municipio as equivalent to a county in the United States for data presentation purposes.
New England County Metropolitan Area (NECMA)
A county-based area designated by the federal Office of Management and Budget to provide an alternative to the county subdivision-based metropolitan statistical areas and consolidated metropolitan statistical areas in New England. See central city, metropolitan area, statistical entity.
Off-reservation trust land
See American Indian off-reservation trust land.
Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA)
A statistical entity identified and delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau in consultation with federally recognized American Indian tribes in Oklahoma that once had a reservation in that state. An OTSA encompasses an area that conforms to a tribe's reservation that was dissolved preceding the establishment of Oklahoma as a state in 1907. For some OTSAs, neighboring tribes agreed to modify the boundary for data presentation purposes. Referred to as a tribal jurisdiction statistical area (TJSA) for the 1990 census and by a single all-encompassing entity called the "Historic Areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized areas)" for the 1980 census.
Outlying Areas
See Island Areas.
Parish
A governmental unit that is the primary legal subdivision of Louisiana. The U.S. Census Bureau treats a parish as equivalent to a county in other states for data presentation purposes.
Place
A concentration of population either legally bounded as an incorporated place, or delineated for statistical purposes as a census designated place (in Puerto Rico, a comunidad or zona urbana). See census designated place, consolidated city, incorporated place, independent city, independent place.
Primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA)
A geographic entity designated by the federal Office of Management and Budget for use by federal statistical agencies. If an area that qualifies as a metropolitan area (MA) has a census population of one million or more, two or more primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) may be defined within it if they meet official standards and local opinion favors the designation. When PMSAs are established within an MA, that MA is designated a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA). See central city, consolidated metropolitan statistical area, metropolitan area, statistical entity.
Pseudo-voting district (pseudo-VTD)
An area for which the U.S. Census Bureau reports voting district (VTD) data, even though the boundary of the actual voting district was adjusted by the reviewing officials, for purposes of data presentation, so that it no longer matches the legally established boundary. See voting district.
Public use microdata area (PUMA)
A geographic entity for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides specially selected extracts of raw information from a small sample of long-form census records that are screened to protect confidentiality of census records. The extract files are referred to as public use microdata samples (PUMS). Public use microdata areas (PUMAs), which must have a minimum census population of 100,000 and cannot cross a state line, receive a 5-percent sample of the long-form records; these records are presented in state files. These PUMAs are aggregated into super-PUMAs, which must have a minimum census population of 400,000 and receive a 1-percent sample in a national file. The Census Bureau provided a 10-percent sample file each for Guam and the Virgin Islands of the United States. Data users can use these files to create their own statistical tabulations and data summaries.
Region (census geographic)
See census region.
Rural
All territory, population, and housing units located outside of urbanized areas and urban clusters. See urban.
School district
A geographic entity within which state, county, or local officials or the U.S. Department of Defense provides public educational services for an area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau provides data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified.
State
A primary governmental division of the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau treats the District of Columbia as the equivalent of a state for data presentation purposes. It also treats a number of entities that are not legal divisions of the United States as the equivalent of states for data presentation purposes: Puerto Rico and the Island Areas.
State designated American Indian statistical area (SDAISA)
A statistical entity delineated for an American Indian tribe that does not have a land base (reservation) and is recognized as a tribe by a state government, but not the federal government. State designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs) are identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by a state liaison identified by the governor's office. A SDAISA generally encompasses, Oklahoma tribal statistical area, tribal designated statistical area, or Alaska Native village statistical area. SDAISAs were included with tribal designated statistical areas for the 1990 census; this designation is new for Census 2000.
State legislative district (SLD)
The area represented by a member of the upper or lower chamber of a state legislature (or, for Nebraska, the unicameral legislature).
Statistical entity
A geographic entity that is specially defined and delineated so that the U.S. Census Bureau may tabulate data for it. Statistical entities include census areas (in Alaska), census county divisions, census subareas (in Alaska), unorganized territories, census designated places, Oklahoma tribal statistical areas, tribal designated statistical areas, state designated American Indian statistical areas, Alaska Native village statistical areas, metropolitan areas, urban areas, census tracts, block groups, and census blocks. Designation as a statistical entity neither conveys nor confers legal ownership, entitlement, or jurisdictional authority. See legal entity.
Subbarrio
A legal subdivision of a barrio or barrio-pueblo (minor civil division) in 23 municipios in Puerto Rico. (There is no geographic entity in the United States equivalent to a subbarrio.) Census 2000 provides the same types of data for subbarrios as it does for barrios and barrios-pueblo. Each subbarrio is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within Puerto Rico. See barrio, barrio-pueblo; sub-MCD.
Sub-MCD
A legal subdivision of a minor civil division (MCD). For Census 2000, only Puerto Rico has sub-MCDs (subbarrios).
Super-PUMA
See public use microdata area.
Tabulation block
The smallest area for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides decennial census data. A tabulation block cannot be split by the boundary of any legal or statistical entity recognized by the Census Bureau for census data presentation. See block number, census block.
Tabulation geography
The geographic entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulates and presents data. See geographic entity, geographic hierarchy.
Tract
See census tract.
Traffic analysis zone (TAZ)
A statistical entity delineated by state and/or local transportation officials for tabulating traffic-related data - especially journey-to-work and place-of-work statistics - from a decennial census. A TAZ usually consists of one or more census blocks, block groups, or census tracts.
Tribal block group
A block group within a tribal census tract. Where a census tract numbered in the 9400 series crosses a county line, a tribal block group may be located on both sides of that boundary. See block group, tribal census tract.
Tribal census tract
A census tract within a federally recognized American Indian reservation and/or off-reservation trust land. Some of these census tracts are numbered in the 9400 series, primarily if they cross a county line. See census tract, tribal block group.
Tribal designated statistical area (TDSA)
A statistical entity delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by a federally recognized American Indian tribe that does not have a land base (a federally recognized reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA generally encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of people who identify with a federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A TDSA may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Oklahoma tribal statistical area, state designated American Indian statistical area, or Alaska Native village statistical area. For the 1990 census, it could not cross a state line, but it may do so for Census 2000. For the 1990 census, TDSAs included state-recognized tribes without a land base; these are now called state designated American Indian statistical areas.
Tribal jurisdiction statistical area (TJSA)
See Oklahoma tribal statistical area.
Tribal subdivision
See American Indian tribal subdivision.
Trust land
See American Indian trust land.
United States
The 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Unorganized territory (UT)
In a state in which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data for minor civil divisions (MCDs), the portion of a county that is not included in a legally established MCD or in an incorporated place that is independent of an MCD. For data presentation purposes, the Census Bureau recognizes such area as one or more separate county subdivisions, each designated as an unorganized territory. For Census 2000, ten states contain one or more UTs.
Urban
All territory, population, and housing units located within urbanized areas and urban clusters. See rural, urban area.
Urban area
A generic term that refers to both urbanized areas and urban clusters. This terminology is new for Census 2000.
Urban cluster (UC)
A densely settled area that has a census population of 2,500 to 49,999. A UC generally consists of a geographic core of block groups or blocks that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile, and adjacent block groups and blocks with at least 500 people per square mile. A UC consists of all or part of one or more incorporated places and/or census designated places; such a place(s) together with adjacent territory; or territory outside of any place. See central place, extended place, urban, urbanized area.
Note: Any urban area delineated in Guam is classified as an urban cluster regardless of its population size.
Note: Any urban area delineated in Guam is classified as an urban cluster regardless of its population size.
Urban growth area (UGA)
In Oregon, an "urban growth boundary" is delineated around each incorporated place or a group of incorporated places by state and local officials, and subsequently confirmed in state law, to control urban development. The U.S. Census Bureau refers to the resulting geographic entities as "urban growth areas" (UGAs). UGAs are new for Census 2000. ("Urban growth boundary" is a legal term; "urban growth area" is a census term.)
Urbanized area (UA)
A densely settled area that has a census population of at least 50,000. A UA generally consists of a geographic core of block groups or blocks that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile, and adjacent block groups and blocks with at least 500 people per square mile. A UA consists of all or part of one or more incorporated places and/or census designated places, and may include additional territory outside of any place. See central place, extended place, urban, urban cluster.
Voting district (VTD)
The generic name for a geographic entity - such as an election district, precinct, or ward - established by state, local, and tribal governments for the purpose of conducting elections. Some reviewing officials adjusted the boundaries of the voting districts (VTDs) they submitted to conform to census block boundaries for data presentation purposes, and therefore a VTD for which Census 2000 provides data might not exactly represent the legal entity; the U.S. Census Bureau refers to such VTDs as pseudo-voting districts (pseudo-VTDs). Such VTDs, as well as any territory for which state officials did not specify a status, are identified by a "P" in the VTD indicator field of the PL data file.
ZIP Code area
The addresses served by a 5-digit ZIP Codea - established by the U.S. Postal Service to expedite the delivery of mail. Most ZIP Codes do not have specific boundaries, and their implied boundaries do not necessarily follow clearly identifiable visible or invisible map features; also, the carrier routes for one ZIP Code may intertwine with those of one or more other ZIP Codes, and therefore this area is more conceptual than geographic. See ZIP Code tabulation area.
ZIP Code tabulation area (ZCTAa)
A statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to approximate the delivery area for a U.S. Postal Service 5-digit or 3-digit ZIP Codea in the United States and Puerto Rico. A ZCTA is an aggregation of census blocks that have the same predominant ZIP Code associated with the mailing addresses in the Census Bureau's Master Address File. Thus, the Postal Service's delivery areas have been adjusted to encompass whole census blocks so that the Census Bureau can tabulate census data for the ZCTAs. For areas larger than 25 square miles for which the Census Bureau's Master Address File contained no addresses with ZIP Codes, the Census Bureau used the first 3 digits of the ZIP Code(s) that serve the area or nearby areas. For the dress rehearsal data, there are two blank spaces after such 3-digit codes; for Census 2000, there is a suffix of "XX." A water feature that could not logically be assigned to a specific ZCTA is assigned a 3-digit code followed by "HH" to indicate that the water feature could not be assigned meaningfully to any adjacent land ZCTA. ZCTAs do not include all ZIP Codes used for mail delivery. The Census Bureau first created ZCTAs for the Census 2000 dress rehearsal census. See ZIP Code area.
Zona urbana
In Puerto Rico, a census designated place consisting of the municipio seat of government and the adjacent built-up area. A zona urbana cannot extend across its municipio's boundary. See census designated place, comunidad.

Dishonest Abe
"Abraham was tested by circumcision, shaving his pubic hair, washing the fore-part and rear, using a toothstick, and plucking his armpits."
Nothing is more essential to Islam’s credibility than Muhammad’s version of Abraham. Islam must prove that he was a Muslim, that his God was Allah, and that he worshiped in Mecca. Recognizing this, Muhammad tried desperately to make the case.
We pick up the trail in Tabari's History with something that sounds like Hitler's idea of Arian supremacy. the children of Shem, the latter would enslave them." The slavery theme keeps reappearing because Muhammad used the slave trade to finance the spread of Islam. Turning Noah into a racist to justify such behavior wasn't beneath Islam’s prophet - but then again, little was.
We're going to pass by Muhammad’s history lesson on the mythical tribes of Ad and Thamud. Their battles with the Almighty seemed important to Muhammad as he dedicated scores of Hadith to them. But I want to focus on the Islamic path to Abraham as it lies at the core of the prophet's deception. Tabari II:50 "Nimrod was Abraham's master and wanted him burned.... The first king who ruled over all the earth was Nimrod. There were four such kings who ruled all the earth: Nimrod, Solomon bin David, Dhu'l-Qarnain, and Nebuchadnezzar - two believers [Muslims] and two infidels." Nimrod only ruled a city-state. Solomon's kingdom only included a portion of the Middle East. Nebuchadnezzar's realm like that of Dhu'l-Qarnain, as Alexander the Great, was large, but neither ruled over the whole earth. As for two of them being Muslims - Muhammad and Allah are again mistaken. There wasn't a Muslim in the batch.
According to Ishaq's Sira: Tabari II:50 "Allah desired to send Abraham as an argument against his people and as a messenger to His worshippers since there had been no messengers between Noah and Abraham except Hud and Salih [the mythical rulers of Ad and Thamud]." If that's true, there couldn't have been Muslim worshippers. A thousand years had passed with no religious communication. Allah said he destroyed the Ad and Thamud and he never suggests Abraham visited them. So in an attempt to establish a religious context for his scam, Muhammad destroyed it. The scenario he has just laid out precludes worshippers, and without them, all he has shared thus far concerning the establishment of Islamic rites and the veneration of the Ka'aba, could not have been passed along.
"As time drew near, the astrologers came to Nimrod, saying, 'We have learned from our lore that a boy will be born in this city of yours who will be called Abraham. He will abandon your religion and break your idols in such and such a month and year." Muslims are attempting to bestow on Abraham, whom they view as the father of Islam, the same kind of birth announcement enjoyed by Yahshua, the founder of Christianity, but they didn't have a clue when either man actually lived.
Both secular and scriptural histories tell us that Nimrod died centuries before Abraham was born. The clay tablets that were unearthed near ancient Babylon starting in the late 19th century suggest Nimrod died violently at the age of forty around 2800 B.C., two generations after the great flood. Apart from the Bible, Abraham is not as well known. Yet, archeologists have been able to confirm the Biblical accounting of when he lived by unearthing the places the Scriptures say he visited or that coexisted during his time. They have found dozens of corroborating artifacts that confirm Abraham lived between 2100 B.C. and 1950 B.C. These men were not contemporaries.
Since their lives were separated by 700 years, everything Muhammad claims about them is both suspect and uninspired. Tabari II:53 "Another story about Abraham is that a star rose over Nimrod so bright that it blotted out the light of the sun and the moon. He became frightened and called the magicians, soothsayers, and prognosticators to ask about it. They said, 'A man will arise in your domain whose destiny is to destroy you and your rule.' Nimrod lived in Babylon but he left his town and moved to another, forcing all men to go with him but leaving the women. He ordered that any male child who was born should be slain." This is a blatant, although not believable, rip-off of the star of Bethlehem that directed wise men to Yahshua and of King Herod killing the male children born that year in Bethlehem.
The Bible tells us that Abram, the future Abraham, was born in Ur, the great Chaldean city, to Terah. His journey to the Promised Land is detailed in Genesis 11. Muhammad says: "Some task in Babylon came up for which Nimrod could trust only Azar, the father of Abraham. He sent him to do the job, saying, 'See that you do not have intercourse with your wife.' Azar said to him, 'I am too tenacious in my religion for that.' But when he entered Babylon he visited his wife and could not control himself. He had intercourse with her and fled to a town called Ur."
Tabari II:53 "When Abraham's mother found that she was in labor she went out to a cave near her house and bore Abraham. She shut the cave up on him and returned home. Later when she went to see how he had done, she found him alive, sucking his thumb. Allah placed Abraham's sustenance in it." Muhammad was abandoned by his mother at birth, so he invented this story to mimic his own childhood.
Tabari II:51 "Abraham had been in the cave for fifteen months when he said to his mother, 'Take me out that I may look around.'" Why bother? After fifteen months of living in a cave, he would have been blind. "So she took him out one evening and he looked about and thought of the creation of the heavens and the earth and said, 'Verily the One who created me and fed me is my Lord - I have no other god but Him.'" Thus, an infant conceived the first pillar of Islam. But alas, the Hadith and Qur'an quickly plummet into spiritual delirium. "He looked out at the sky and saw a star. 'This is my Lord.' He followed it with his eyes until it disappeared. When it set he said, 'I do not like things that set.' Then he saw the moon rising and said, 'This is my Lord.' [Perceptive kid - Allah began his life as a moon deity.] And he followed it until it disappeared. When it set, he said, 'If my Lord did not guide me, I would have gone astray.'" A fifteen-month-old baby converts from paganism to Islam by watching the moon. Sure, why not.
Like so many Islamic Traditions, these were written to provide the context the Qur'an lacks. Let's dive into the 6th surah to hear what Allah has to say: Qur'an 6:74 "When Abraham said to his sire, Azar: 'Why do you take idols for gods? I find you and your people in manifest error.' Thus We showed Abraham the visible and invisible kingdom of the heavens and earth that he might be of those who are sure and believe. So when night overshadowed him, he saw a star. Said he: 'This is my Lord.' When it set, he said: 'I do not love the setting ones.' When he saw the moon rising, he said: 'This is my Lord.' When it set, he said: 'If my Lord had not guided me I would be of the erring people who go astray.'" This is embarrassing. The conversation condemns the message. After Allah personally showed Abe his kingdom so that he might be sure, the Islamic babe turns to the sky, the source of idols, and says, "This is my Lord." What is it about Islam that turns everyone's brains to mush - Allah’s included?
Qur'an 6:78 "Then when he saw the sun rising, he said: 'My Lord is surely this, the greatest of all.' So when it set, he said: 'O my people, I am through with those. Surely I have turned my face toward Him who originated the heavens and earth, and I am not a polytheist.'" The sun, the most popular pagan deity, is now god, never mind it was the moon in the preceding Tradition. After becoming an idolater, he magically turns and says he's through with idols. And after asking a star, the moon, and the sun if they were god, he says he's not a polytheist. All the context in the world, all the explanations ever written, can't undo the damage the Qur'an does to itself.
Tabari explains it this way: Tabari II:51 "When day came upon Abraham and the sun rose, he saw the greatness of the sun and saw that here was something with more light than he had ever seen before. He said, 'This is my Lord! This is greater.' And when it set he exclaimed, 'O my people, I am free from all the things which you associate with Him.'" Muhammad wants us to believe that all it took to "free" this fifteen-month old baby from pagan idolatry, worshiping the sun, moon, and stars, to become a Muslim in the oneness of Allah was for the sun to set.
Qur'an 6:80 "His people disputed with him." What people? Depending upon whether you believe Muhammad’s Hadith or Allah’s Qur'an, he's with his mom or dad. He's a toddler, having just emerged from a cave for the first time. "He said: 'Do you dispute with me respecting Allah? He has guided me. I do not fear those that you set up with Him, unless my Lord pleases; my Lord comprehends all things; will you not mind?'"
Let me see if I can decipher this. Over the course of one brief conversation, dishonest Abe tells his father that he and his people are in manifest error, and that idolatry is bad. After visiting heaven he says that big bright shiny things are gods, and that he is not a polytheist. Then he disputes with people he has never seen about their religion. He even says that he doesn't fear their gods, unless of course, his god wants him to fear them. And, wouldn't you know it, after such drivel, he tells them to mind him. This Qur'anic passage destroys the Islamic myth of divine inspiration, for this is not some minor event in the life of Islam. Abraham is purported to be the religion's founder, and this is his moment of awakening.
Qur'an 6:81 "Why should I fear what you have set up with Allah, that for which He has not sent down to you any authority." We can only assume that the Abe babe is speaking of idols his people have erected in shrines like the Ka'aba. "O my father! Why do you worship that which neither hears, nor sees, nor can in any way help you?" Even something as simple as this indicts Muhammad. It’s a rip off. As we shall see in upcoming chapters, Arabian Hanifs (monotheists) during Muhammad’s day had it figured out. They had said of the rock idols in the Ka'aba, "Why do you worship that which neither hears, nor sees, nor can help you in any way?"
"Do you reject my gods, Abraham? If you do not cease this, I shall stone you." As sick as this sounds, it depicts Muslim behavior. If a son renounces Islam, his father will kill him. One of my friends, a former Muslim, had this very thing happen to him. Hearing the news, his loving father reached for his gun and fired it at his son, narrowly missing him. Mark Gabriel, who holds a Ph.D. in Islamic History, wrote a book about his experience called: Islam and Terror.
Qur'an 6:83 "And this was Our argument which we gave to Abraham against his people. And We gave him Ishaq (Isaac) and Yah'qub (Jacob) [Oops. Abraham was given Isaac and Ishmael. Jacob came later]; each did We guide, and Nuh (Noah) did We guide before, and of his descendants, David and Solomon, and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron; and thus do We reward those who do good (following Muhammad’s example in the Sunnah). And Zachariah and Yahya (John), Isa (Jesus) and Elias; every one was of the good [i.e. Muslims]; And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot and every one We preferred above men and jinn." One of the many problems with the Qur'an is that Allah was no brighter than Muhammad. Job was a gentile and a contemporary of Abraham. As such he could neither be Abe's descendant nor follow Solomon.
I am reasonably certain that the Yathrib Jews read their scriptures correctly to Muhammad. But having a poor memory, and a heinous agenda, he got them all fouled up. I don't say that to be mean-spirited, just informative. Muhammad will convict himself of having a heinous agenda a thousand times over before we are through. As prophets go, he was pretty pathetic.
Returning to the Islamicized Abraham, Ibn Ishaq tells us: Tabari II:52 "Then Abraham returned to his father Azar, having seen the right course. He had recognized his Lord." Actually, all he had done was recognize who his Lord wasn't And while that may sound picky, that's all Muhammad really did. Ultimately, he promoted the largest of the Meccan rock idols, Allah, and denounced the rest. "He was free of the religion of his people, but he did not tell them that." This, too, is revisionism for the sake of Muhammad. Allah’s Messenger kept quiet about his first "revelation" for several years.
One of the most repetitive and damning indictments in the Qur'an comes from the Meccans. They recognized that Muhammad’s notion of casting the smaller Ka'aba idols aside so that the largest idol could be feared as the one true god was lunacy. A big stone was no more god than a bunch of little ones. Ishaq:38 "Every house had an idol. When Allah sent Muhammad with the message of monotheism, the Quraysh said: 'Would he make many gods into one god? This is a strange thing.'" So Muhammad, ever in character, changed the story of the great Hebrew patriarch Abraham to make his behavior seem inspired.
This sorry tale is chronicled in both the Hadith and Qur'an. Tabari II:55 "His father told him, 'Abraham, we have a festival. If you go to it you will learn to like our religion.' The festival came and they went to it. On the way Abraham threw himself down and said, 'I am sick. My foot hurts.' When they went away he called to the last of them. 'I shall deal with your idols after you have gone away and turned your backs.' Abraham went to the house of the gods which was in a great hall. Opposite the entrance was a great idol, and at his side a smaller one, and next to him a smaller one, and so on." Too bad Allah didn't get out more. He would have known that in Abraham's day the Temple of Ur housed just one god - Sin - a masculine moon deity like himself. Unlike the Ka'aba, there weren't a bunch of rock idols lying around.
"Azar made a living making the idols which his people worshipped, and he employed Abraham to sell them. Abraham would call out, 'Who will buy what will be of no use to him.' So they became unsellable. He would take them to the river and point their heads at it and say, 'Drink.' mocking his people. At length his mocking spread about among the inhabitants of his town, although Nimrod did not hear of it. Then when the time seemed right to Abraham to reveal to his people the error of what they were doing, and to tell them of Allah’s command and of how to pray, he glanced up at the stars and said, 'I feel sick.' They fled from him when they heard it, but Abraham had only said it to make them go away so that he could do what he wanted with their idols. When they left he went to the idols and brought them food. He said, 'Will you not eat? What is the matter? Why do you not speak?' reproaching their falsely elevated position and mocking them."
If you've got one, open your Qur'an to the 37th surah. So as not to take Allah’s word out of context, let's read from the beginning, picking up the highlights as we go along. Seeing Allah as he really is will help elucidate the Islamic mystery. The peace-loving god tells his troops: "By those (angels) arranged in battle ranks who are strong in repelling and thus proclaim the Message of Allah! Verily, your Ilah (God) is one!" Thank god for small favors. Qur'an 37:6 ." In Islam, stars are used to guard against forward devils. The Islamic Ilah (God) named Allah would have us believe that he dissuades and torments "evil spirits" with physical objects.
Qur'an 37:11 "Just ask their opinion (Muhammad). [Whose opinion - the stars', the rebellious evil spirits'?] Are they the more difficult to create, or the other beings We have created? Them have We created out of a sticky clay! Are they stronger as a creation? Truly dost thou marvel, while they ridicule." Nay, I dost both marvel and ridicule. Qur'an 37:13 "When they are admonished, pay no heed. When they see a Sign, [they] turn it to mockery, and incite one another to scoff. And say, 'This is nothing but evident sorcery!'" I agree.
Qur'an 37:16 "What! When we die, and become dust and bones, shall we be raised up and also our fathers of old? Say (Muhammad): 'Yea, and ye shall then be humiliated: Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low.'" I suppose some Muslim scholar thought translating the Qur'an into Elizabethan English would make it sound religious. But lo, methinks it helpeth thee not. For your sake and mine, I will continue to edit most of the archaic language out of the text. I have also made a habit of correcting much of Allah’s grammar, punctuation, verbosity, and oblique sentence structure. Qur'an 37:19 "Then will be a single cry; and behold, they will stare! They will say, 'Woe to us! This is the Day of Doom.' This you denied! Assemble the wrong-doers and their wives and the things they worshipped besides Allah, then lead them to the fierce flaming fires of Hell." Even cleaned up, the message is repulsive.
Allah stoops to interrogate his captives. Qur'an 37:24 "But stop them, for they are to be questioned. 'What is the matter with you that you do not help each other.' Nay, but this day they make full submission.... 'The sentence has come against us: we shall taste the punishment.'" Remember, according to Islam, people are never given a choice. They are predestined at birth to perish in hell's fire. Thus, this questioning is for Allah’s entertainment. Qur'an 37:33 "Truly, they will all share at the Penalty of Doom. That is how We shall deal with the Mujrimun (non-Muslims). For when they were told that there is no ilah (god) but Allah, they puffed themselves up with pride and were scornful. They said: 'What, shall we give up our alihah (gods) for the sake of an insane possessed poet?'" This was "revealed" so Muhammad could lash out at the Meccans. They called him insane for turning many idols into one god. They said he was demon-possessed due to the hellish tone of his Qur'an.
As you might expect, Allah didn't see it that way. Muhammad’s alter ego had but one spokesperson. If he faltered, Allah crumbled with him. Qur'an 37:37 "Nay, he has come with the truth, and he confirms the Message of the messengers before him. You shall indeed taste the grievous penalty of painful doom." Tease Muhammad and Allah will burn you. It’s the Qur'an's never-ending taunt.
Qur'an 37:40 "Save the chosen slaves of Allah; For them there is a known provision: Fruits, Delights; they will be honored in the Gardens of Pleasure, on thrones facing one another. Round them will be passed a cup of pure white wine, delicious to the drinkers, free from ghoul (hurt) or intoxication, nor shall you be made mad or exhausted thereby." We've got the thrones and Allah’s special brew, now all we need are the virgins. "And with them will be Qasirat-at-Tarf (virgin females), restraining their glances (desiring none but you), with big, beautiful eyes. As if they were (sheltered) eggs, preserved."
If the martyrs get virgins, what do their victims get? Qur'an 37:54 "He said: 'Would you like to look down.' He looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire, in the depths of Hell. He said: 'You nearly caused me to perish! Had it not been for my Lord, I would have been among those brought there [the suicide bomber said to the innocent children he had blown to pieces]!'" Allah wanted the mass murderers to know: Qur'an 37:59 "Except for your former death, you shall not be punished. This is the supreme triumph! For the likes of this let us strive. That is the better entertainment."
Hell's torments sound a lot like what might have occurred around a desert campfire.," Allah, Islam’s terrorist ilah proclaimed.
We have finally arrived at the passage the Hadith was trying to illuminate. We wanted to find out why Abraham said he was sick and why he was playing with idols. Qur'an 37:83 "Surely among those who followed His Way (Islam) was Abraham. He came to his Lord with a sound heart. He said to his father and to his folk, 'What is that which you worship? Is it a falsehood - alihah (gods) besides Allah that you desire?'" The Qur'an didn't define what his "Way" was. Islam is supposed to be the religion of Abraham yet the Qur'an never explains what that might be.
Qur'an 37:87 "'Then what is your idea about the Lord of men and jinn.' Abraham cast a glance at the Stars. And he said, 'I am indeed sick!'" Abe's question about the Lord of the worlds followed by the capitalization of "Stars" is a problem. In the Qur'an, capitalization is a tribute to deity. Second, why did Abraham need to lie to accomplish his god's agenda? One of my translations actually alters the text by adding a parenthetical to obfuscate this problem: "Surely I am sick (of your worshipping these)." Another says "sick (with plague)." Even Muhammad calls Abe a liar. Tabari II:63 "The Messenger said: 'Abraham told three lies in his life. Two of them were about Allah - his saying "I feel sick" and his saying "The chief idol is the one who did it."'"
Qur'an 37:90 "They turned their backs and went away. He turned to their gods secretly and said, 'Will you not eat?' 'What is the matter with you that you don't speak?'" Deprived of place, time, and circumstance, this doesn't make sense. Where was he? Why did he go to these gods? What are their names? And since Allah never spoke or ate, the revisionist Abe is being hypocritical. The following Hadith, stolen from the Talmud, scrambles to make sense of this: Tabari II:55 "The people prepared food and placed it before the gods, saying, 'When we come back the gods will have blessed our food and we will eat.' When Abraham saw them with the food, he said, 'Will you not eat?' And when they did not answer, he said, 'What ails you that you don't speak?' Then he attacked them. He took a piece of iron and cut off each idol's extremities. Then when only the largest idol was left, he tied the axe to its hand. When the people came to get their food and saw their gods in this state, they said, 'An evildoer has done this to our gods.'"
That was from Muhammad’s Sunnah by way of the Jewish Talmud. This is from Allah’s Qur'an: Qur'an 37:93 "He turned upon them secretly, attacking, striking (them) with the right hand. Then came (people) with hurried steps, and faced (him). He said: 'What! do you worship what you hew out? But Allah has created you and your handwork!'"
Let's turn to the salient portion of the 21st surah, named "The Prophets," to make certain we are looking at Islam’s poison pill from all possible sides. Qur'an 21:51 "We bestowed on Abraham correctness of conduct, and well were We acquainted with him. Behold, he said to his father and his folk, 'What are these images, to which you are devoted?' They said, 'We found our fathers worshipping them.' He said, 'Indeed you have been in manifest error - you and your fathers.' They said, 'Have you brought us the truth, or are you some jester?'" This Qur'anic indulgence also emerges out of the blue without reference to the audience, place, time, or religion. Devoid of this context the passage is senseless today. Yet in Mecca, the meaning would have been crystal clear. Muhammad was being recast as Abraham.
Qur'an 21:56 "He said, 'Nay, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and earth, He created them and I am a witness to this. I have a plot for your idols and will do something against them after you go away and turn your backs.' So he broke them to pieces, (all) but the biggest of them, that they might turn to it." A second translation says: "Then he reduced them to fragments, all save the chief of them, that haply they might have recourse to it."
This is one of the most incriminating verses in the Qur'an. Muhammad did this very thing. The prophet took the largest of the pagan idols of the Ka'aba - Allah - and promoted it to the exclusion of the others. He broke the smaller rock gods and elevated the Black Stone so that his people "might turn to it." It was as if the early Greeks had broken the statues of Athena, Poseidon, and Hermes so that they could worship the one true god Zeus. How was the biggest idol any more "god" than the other imposters?
While I'll continue to convey Islam’s version of dishonest Abe to illustrate how Muhammad crafted his religious scam, I would be remiss if I didn't credit the prophet with his first miracle. He just pounded a nail into his own coffin.
The Qur'anic story continues with these uninspired words: Qur'an 21:59 "They said, 'Who has done this to our alihah (gods)?' 'He is a mischief-monger.' 'We heard a youth talk of them called Abraham.' 'Then bring him before us that he may testify.' They said, 'Are you the one who did this?' He said: 'No, it was done by the biggest idol! Ask the other idols if they can speak!'...They were utterly shamed and confounded. 'You know they do not speak.' He said: 'What! Do you then serve besides Allah what brings no profit, nor can harm you? 'Fie [?] upon you, and upon the things that you worship besides Allah! Have you no sense.' They said, 'Burn him and protect our gods.'" Since Allah never spoke, why didn't that shame Muhammad? And why would the supposed patriarch of monotheistic Islam tell his people that a pagan god smashed lesser idols? Would that not make the idol real? Moreover, the Muhammadized Abraham called a "god" false because it "cannot harm you." The implication is that Allah is real because he's fixated on sadistic torments. That's not good.
Now that we have an argument raging, it's time to reshape Abraham of Ur into the image of Muhammad of Mecca. For this we will bounce between the 37th and 21st surahs. Qur'an 37:97 "They said, 'Build him a furnace, and fling him into the blazing red-hot fire.' They then sought a plot against him, but We made them the ones most humiliated! And he said: 'Surely I fly to my lord; He will guide me.'" When the townsfolk of Mecca developed their plot and tried to burn Muhammad’s britches, he flew off to Allah in his dreams. He jumped on al-Buraq, an imaginary winged steed, half ass and half donkey (like its rider), and cruised to heaven by way of Jerusalem. Although he humiliated himself with his tale of derring-do, Muhammad also claimed that it was really the Meccans who were dashed.
Qur'an 21:69 "We said, 'O Fire, be cool and safety for Abraham.' Then they sought a stratagem against him and wished to set a snare, but We made them the ones that lost most!" I know Allah loves plots, but this is ridiculous. Why would the townsfolk design a plot to snare him after they were burning him? Qur'an 21:71 "But We delivered him and Lot to the land [of Israel] which We have blessed for men and jinn." This must be a joke. Allah has blessed Israel? Was that the blessing of the PLO or Islamic Jihad?
As the Islamic Abraham flees the fire, we are confronted with an odd transition and unbelievable dialog. Qur'an 37:100 "'Lord, grant me a righteous (son).' So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear. Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said: 'Son! I see in a vision that I offer you in sacrifice: Now what is your view.' (The son) said: 'O my father! Do as you are commanded: you will find me, if Allah so wills, one practicing Patience and Constancy!'" Even with nine words artificially inserted into the text by the translators for clarification, this verse is bizarre. It is as if Muhammad overheard a half dozen Bible stories and tried to tie them all together in one paragraph. Over the course of five sentences he takes us from a gang of nameless people building a furnace to terrorize Abe to having him terrorize his son. And there is a significant detail missing - the son's name isn't stated because Muhammad can't decide which son should be sacrificed or even where or when the event occurred.
Qur'an 37:103 "When they had surrendered (to Allah), and he had flung him on his face, We called out, 'Abraham! You have fulfilled the vision! Lo! that was a clear test. And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice, with a tremendous victim!'" Allah, the counterfeit god, continues to falsify history. Qur'an 37:110 "Thus do We reward the doers of good. For he was one of Our believing slaves. And We gave him the good news of the birth of Isaac, a prophet among the good ones. We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are (some) that do right, and (some) that obviously do wrong." As a reward for Abraham's faithfulness, Allah predicts the birth of the son he almost sacrificed. Brilliant.
Somewhere, sometime, someone may have done a worse job plagiarizing, but it's hard to imagine. The omissions, the lack of place, time, and purpose degrade one of the Bible's great events. Muhammad, I mean Allah, was trying to rip off, I mean utilize, the story of Abraham and Isaac. The original provides such a refreshing change from this drivel it's worth a quick review.
First, Yahweh sets the scene and unfolds the story chronologically. Genesis chronicles the life of Abraham, the places he lived, the people he encountered, as well as the birth of his two sons, Isaac and Ishmael. Yahweh had told Abraham to send Ishmael out of the Promised Land, and the boy fell out of Abraham's life and Yahweh's plans, fading into Biblical oblivion. As we approach the 22nd chapter, God tells us that Abraham was living in Beersheba. He had just returned from visiting the Philistines in Gaza. Within that context, he speaks to him about Isaac, the patriarch's miracle child from his wife Sarah, the beneficiary of the covenant.
"Now it came about after these things, that Yahweh tested Abraham and called to him, 'Abraham.' 'Here I am.' Yahweh said, 'Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a sacrifice on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.'" The Temple in Jerusalem was built on Mount Moriah by Solomon to commemorate Abraham's faith. Yahshua would be sacrificed there to save mankind. To this day, it remains the most coveted place on earth. And it's a three-day walk, forty miles north by northwest, from Beersheba.
The details of the sacrifice were extraordinarily important to Yahweh. This drama had to be played out exactly as it would happen to Yahshua. The timing was important, too. The call came 2,000 years after the fall of Adam and two thousand years before the Messiah endured the same fate. Remember, Yahweh gave us a pattern - six eras of creation followed by an era of rest. It has been nearly 2,000 years since Yahshua's sacrifice and the Scriptures tell us that 1,000 years of peace will follow his return.
"So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him along with Isaac. He split wood for the sacrifice and went to the place Yahweh had told him to go. On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw it from a distance. Abraham said to his young men, 'Stay here with the donkey. The lad and I will go yonder. We will worship and return to you.' Abraham took the wood for the offering and laid it on his son. He took the fire and the knife. (Fire is a metaphor for judgment and the knife is the implement of atonement.) Walking together, Isaac said, 'My father.' He answered, 'Here I am, my son.' 'I see the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the offering?' 'Yahweh will provide for himself the lamb for the offering.'" (Notice that Abraham actually answers in God’s name - I Am, or Yahweh - every time he is called.)
"When they came to the place of which Yahweh had told him; Abraham arranged the altar, bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the wood. Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to sacrifice his son. But Yahweh called to him from heaven, and said, 'Abraham.' 'Here I am.' 'Do not stretch out your hand against the boy and do nothing to him for I know that you love Me, since you have not withheld your son, your only son from Me.'
"Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked and saw a ram caught in the thicket by his horns; he took the ram and offered him in place of his son. 'Because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, I will greatly bless you and I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens...and through your descendents all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.' So Abraham returned to his men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba where Abraham lived."
Real scripture sets human events in context so that we can learn something. Yahweh not only explained the nature of his relationship with man but also explained what was to come, so when it happened, we might recognize the significance.
Returning to the Sira, Ishaq replays Muhammad’s fantasy in front of Nimrod rather than in the great hall of idols. After daring the gods to talk, Abraham is questioned by a king who died 700 years earlier. Tabari II:57 "'Have you seen this Allah whom you worship and whose worship you call others? Who is he.' Abraham replied, 'My Lord, Who gives life and causes death.' [The question was too tough so he did the old political side step.] Nimrod said, 'I give life and cause death.'" They chatted about this for a while and then Abraham said, "'Allah causes the sun to rise in the East, so can you make it rise in the West.' [Good thing he didn't mention the chariot thing, the angelic handholds, or the garment of luminosity.] Knowing that it was as Abraham said, Nimrod was ashamed. He gave no answer; he knew that he was not able to do that. Allah said, 'Thus was the unbeliever abashed' - that is to say, the proof was against him." Now that Muslims know that the sun does not follow Allah’s commands, shouldn't they be ashamed? Isn't the proof clearly against them?
Tabari II:58 "They pushed Abraham into the furnace. Then the heavens and earth and all creatures therein except humans and jinn shouted to Allah, 'Our Lord! Abraham, the only one on your earth who worships you, is being burned in fire for your sake. Permit us to help him.'" Everybody talks to Allah except humans and demons. Who might they be? "Allah answered, 'I am his friend. I will protect him. O fire! Be coolness and peace for Abraham.'" So following this fireside chat, we read: "Imprison him in a building and cast him into Hell. ... Abraham raised his head [and contradicted most all of what we have read thus far], 'You are alone in heaven and I am alone on earth.'...Had Allah not followed the command for coolness with peace, Abraham would have frozen to death."
Tabari II:62 "Abraham and Lot set out for Syria. On the way Abraham met Sarah, who was the daughter of the king of Harran." Actually, Abram left Ur for Haran traveling along the banks of the Euphrates River. He was accompanied by his father, Terah, his wife and half sister, Sarai, and his nephew, Lot. "She had criticized her people about their religion, so he married her, since he would be able to have a believing wife without having to convert her." This verse implies one becomes a Muslim by criticizing a religion. "Then Abraham went forth, a fugitive for the sake of his Lord...to practice his religion and worship safely." Why would Abe fear for his safety after being saved from the fire? And why, if he was God’s messenger, did he leave town? Shouldn't he have stayed and tried to save the Babylonians?
No. Recasting Abraham was more important. Muhammad fled Mecca as a fugitive. He ran to Yathrib, today’s Medina because some pagans promised to protect him. The revisionist Abraham makes the cowardly Muhammad appear more godly. "He settled in Harran. Then he left as a fugitive and traveled to Egypt which was under the rule of one of the earliest Pharaohs." Well, not exactly. The first Egyptian ruler was probably the Scorpion King. He ruled more than five hundred years before Abraham's arrival.
"Sarah was one of the best humans ever. She would not disobey Abraham in any way." That was Muhammad’s idea of a perfect woman. From Bukhari's Book of Belief:.'"
Next we find that Muhammad "Islamicized" Abram's encounter with Pharaoh. The only germane insight into this affair is Pharaoh's gift of Hagar, a "Coptic" slave-girl. Flunking history, the Allah/Muhammad duo didn't know that the Coptics were centuries away from arriving on the international scene. Leaving Pharaoh, Abraham tells Sarah, "You are my sister in Allah, for in all this land there are no Muslims except ourselves." So what happened to all those scrolls and to the nations who were worshiping around Allah’s House?
Some of what follows includes: "Hagar was of good appearance and Sarah gave her to Abraham, saying, 'Take her. You may take pleasure in Hagar, for I have permitted it.'" "The Messenger said, 'When you conquer Egypt treat its people well. They're kin and deserve protection.'" "Abraham left Egypt for Syria, for he was afraid of the Egyptian king and anxious about his evil ways. He settled in Beersheba in the land of Palestine, which is the desert of Syria." While most of this comes out of the Bible, it is flavored with the standard Muslim embellishments. One such addition is revealing. There was no Palestine during Abraham's life. The word was first composed by the Romans 2,100 years after Abraham died. The patriarch actually returned to Canaan, named after his great, great uncle. (Folks with King James Bibles may think Isaiah invented the name, but it's an errant translation. Isaiah 14:29 uses "pelesheth," which means: "rolling in dust."
Tabari II:66 "Abraham dug a well in Beersheba and said, 'Drink from it and do not let a menstruating woman dip water from it.'" Muhammad, a sexual libertine if there ever was one, hated menstruation with a passion. As you know, he said that the reason Allah’s Stone turned from white to black was "it was fingered by menstruating women." And as sick as that sounds, this next Hadith is used by Muslims to justify brutalizing their daughters. Tabari II:72 "Sarah swore to cut something off of Hagar. ."
"A menstruating woman came and dipped water from the well. Whereupon the water dried up." While I do not know the connection, the next paragraph begins: "When Allah wished to destroy Lot's people, he sent his messengers to Abraham, commanding him to leave their community. [Weren't we just told that the only two Muslims were Abe and Sarah? And Abraham was in Beersheba, not Sodom, so why ask him to leave?] They had done vile deeds which no one in the two worlds had done before, disbelieving their prophets and rejecting the good counsel which Lot brought them from their Lord. The messengers were ordered to visit Abraham and give him and Sarah tidings of the coming of Isaac and also of Jacob who was to come after him." For Islam to have any hope of being credible, the good news had to be of Ishmael not Isaac. Jacob wasn't Sarah's kid, and neither Jacob nor Isaac are of any value to Islam.
At this point, the Muslim mathematicians jumped into the fray: Tabari II:68 "Abraham was sixteen when he was thrown into the fire, and Isaac was seven when he was sacrificed, while Sarah was ninety when she bore him. The place of his sacrifice was about two miles from Bayt Iliya [?]. When Sarah learned what Allah wanted with Isaac, she fell ill for two days and died on the third. Sarah was 127 when she died." Muslim math is as confused as Muslim science: 127-90=7. So much for Arabic numerals.
Now we get to the important part. Tabari II:69 "After Ishmael and Isaac were born, Allah commanded Abraham to build a House for Him in which He would be worshipped and His name mentioned." This must be the House that Allah didn't build in heaven, that Adam didn't build, that Seth didn't build, that Noah didn't circumnavigate after Allah didn't raise it above the flood.
"Abraham did not know exactly where he was expected to build it, since Allah had not made this clear [nor anything else], and he felt uneasy in the matter. Some scholars say that Allah sent the Sakinah to him [a rip-off of the Hebrew Shekhinah - the presence of Yahweh] to show him where to build the House. The Sakinah went with Abraham, who was also accompanied by his wife Hagar [Hagar was never Abraham's wife and Muslims know it.] and his son Ishmael, who was a small boy."
The Tradition continues: "A man came to Ali bin Talib [Muhammad’s adopted son, his son-in-law, future Caliph], and said, 'Will you tell me about the House?' He replied, 'It was the first built with the blessing of the standing-place of Abraham, and whoever enters it will be safe. If you wish, I will tell you how it was built. Allah said to Abraham, "Build Me a House on earth!" Abraham felt uneasy, so He sent the Sakinah. The Sakinah is a gale-force wind with two heads, and one head followed the other until they reached Mecca and coiled up at the site of the House, the way a snake coils.'"
There are some who suggest that Allah is Satan, the snake who tempted Adam. Using this metaphor to describe Allah’s presence supports that theory. But whether or not that is true, this passage is troubling. Mecca is nearly a thousand miles from Beersheba. These places are separated by rugged mountains and virtually impassible desert. There is no plausible way a hundred-year-old man, a slave girl, and a small child could have endured such a journey. And this may be why neither Muhammad nor Allah ever bothered to tell us how they accomplished the improbable voyage.
Tabari II:70 "Abraham was commanded to build where the Sakinah had rested. When he had finished it except for one stone, [guess which one] the boy went away to build something else. But Abraham said, 'No, I still need one more stone, as I still order you.' So the boy went looking, and when he found one he brought it to Abraham. But Abraham had already set the Black Stone in place. He said, 'Father, who brought you this Stone?' Abraham answered, 'It was Gabriel who brought it to me from heaven.' Then the two of them finished it." And I could have sworn that Muhammad told us that the stone was brought to earth by Adam (Tabari I:298). Was he lying then, or now?
Version two follows. It is also from Ali: "When he built it he went forth and left Hagar and Ishmael behind. Ishmael became very thirsty. Hagar climbed Safa to look for water but saw nothing. Then she went to Marwah, but the same thing happened. Then she returned to Safa and looked around, but could not find Ishmael. After looking seven times without success she said, 'Ishmael, you have died where I cannot see you.'" You may be wondering why she would look for water now and yet not have bothered during the three-month desert crossing. You may be wondering why she would look on the top of barren mountains rather than in a valley oasis. You may be wondering why she repeated the process seven times, endangering the life of her child. The answer is Islam. Muhammad needed to make the hajj rites religious. Even today Muslims are required to run between these mountains seven times. This explains why they do it.
However, there were problems. Abraham was supposed to be the father of Islam. In this Hadith, he didn't perform any of the rites. He merely re-re-re-rebuilt the House and bailed. And the one who performed the Islamic ritual, Hagar, left Islam’s most important child alone in the desert (as did Muhammad’s mother, not so coincidentally).
The sacred Meccan well of Zamzam needed Biblical credibility too, so... "The boy scraped the ground with his finger and the spring of Zamzam welled up. Hagar began to dam up the water, but Gabriel said, 'Leave it.'"
In the versions that follow, we're told, "Abraham and Ishmael set out for Mecca. They took pickaxes without knowing where the house was. So Allah sent a wind, which had two wings and a head of a snake. It swept the area around the Ka'aba clear for them to build the foundations of the original House." Not on the foundations, nor to see the foundations, but to build the foundations of the original House. "This was when Allah said, 'When We prepared for Abraham the place of the House.' [Qur'an 22:26]"
Since three contradictory versions were not enough: Tabari II:71 "Allah commanded Abraham to build the House and to call on humanity to perform the pilgrimage. He left Syria with his son Ishmael and his mother Hagar. Allah sent the Sakinah which had the power of speech. Abraham followed it to Mecca. When it came to the place of the House, it spun round and round and said to Abraham, 'Build on me! Build on me.' [Allah’s House was built upon a snake.] Abraham laid the foundations and raised the House, working with Ishmael until they came to the cornerstone. Abraham said, 'O my little son, find me a stone which I can put here as a sign to the people.' He brought him a stone, but Abraham did not like it. When Ishmael came back the cornerstone had already been brought and put in place." After failing math, science, and history, Islam is failing architecture. The cornerstone is the first rock laid, not the last. And cornerstones are big and rectangular. The Allah Stone is small and oval. But again, it wasn't by accident. The Scriptures refer prophetically to Yahshua as "the cornerstone" and you-know-who was desperate to be just like him.
How was Abraham supposed to call humanity to this place? The valley was uninhabited. It was in the middle of a foreboding desert. The first settlement wouldn't be established for 2,500 years. Furthermore, the Islamic Abraham was piling un-hewn, un-mortared rocks in a desert ravine. The first heavy rain would have done it in.
Perhaps the fifth version of Abraham in Mecca will be more rational. After circumcising Hagar, rather than cutting off her nose: Tabari II:72 "Sarah said, 'She will not live in the same town with me.' So Allah told Abraham to go to Mecca, where there was no House at the time. He took Hagar and her son and put them there.... Allah pointed out to Abraham the place to build the House [which would make Allah the snake]. .... When they reached Mecca, there was nothing there but acacia trees." If that is true, Muhammad’s earlier accounts must have been false. "The House at the time was but a hill of red clay.... When he was done, Abraham headed back to Syria.... Gabriel dug out Zamzam with his heel for Ishmael." All I can assume is that neither Muhammad nor Allah had a clue as to how the rock-pile got there. These wildly divergent explanations are preceded and followed by dozens more. It is as if Muslims think truth can be found in a pile of lies, if only the pile is big enough.
The Traditions move on to recount a variety of patriarchal Meccan visits. Never mind that Mecca didn't exist. Muhammad wants us to believe in fairytales, in talking stones and trees: Tabari II:78 "And everything that heard him - stones, trees, hills, and dust said, 'Here I am, Allah, here I am.'"
Continuing to give meaningless ritual religious meaning: Tabari II:81 "Abraham took Ishmael with him on the day of Tarwiyah [the 8th day of the hajj] and stayed at Mina with the Muslims who were there. He prayed with them the prayers of midday, afternoon, sunset and late evening. He spent the night and prayed the dawn prayer with them. In the morning he went out to Arafat, and he spoke to them there until sunset drew near." This Hadith goes on to detail all of the remaining hajj rituals, all of which are still performed by Muslims as if they were acting out Abraham's example. "He showed them the sacrifice-ground of Mina, then performed the sacrifice and shaved his head. From Mina he went into the crowd to show them how to perform the march around the Ka'aba. Then he took them back to Mina to show them how to throw the stones, until he had completed the pilgrimage and proclaimed it to mankind."
Because the previous account was unbelievable for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which was that there were no Muslims in Mecca, Muhammad felt compelled to give it an angelic twist. Tabari II:82 "The Prophet said, 'Gabriel came to Abraham on the day of Tarwiyah and went with him to Mina, Arafat, back to Mina, threw stones, performed the sacrifice, shaved his head, and finally hurried to the House. Then Allah ordered Muhammad to 'follow the religion of Abraham.'" [Qur'an 16:123] That must mean that the religion of Abraham, Islam, can be defined as running between two desolate mountains, tossing stones at stones, shaving one's head, and walking around a rock pile. And so it would be. Even today, Islam is known for its rites and rituals rather than for its righteousness or reason.
As we turn the page, we find ourselves embroiled in the mother of all disagreements. Even Muhammad and Allah are at odds: "The earliest sages of our Prophet's nation disagree about which of Abraham's two sons it was that he was commanded to sacrifice. Some say it was Isaac, while other say it was Ishmael." Mind you, these are the very same people we are reliant upon for remembering the Qur'an and passing it along orally so that other sages could jot it down. This might well explain why it is so disjointed, contradictory, and I dare say silly, (not to mention perverted, demented, and disgusting).
Tabari reports: "Both statements are supported by testimony related on the authority of the Prophet. Both statements are equally sound since they both came from the Prophet. Thus only the Qur'an [which also came from the Prophet] could serve as proof that the account naming Isaac was clearly the more truthful of the two." But if that is the case, Islam falters, since it draws its legitimacy from Ishmael. Muhammad claims that he was "prophet quality" because he was a direct descendant of Ishmael.
Tabari II:83 "'We ransomed him with a tremendous victim.' [Qur'an 37:107] refers to Isaac." But how can that be? In verse 104 Allah says, "We called out, 'Abraham, You have fulfilled your dream, thus do we reward the good. That was indeed a trying test.' So...We gave him the good news of Isaac." How can Abe have nearly sacrificed Isaac if the reward for fulfilling that trying test was Isaac?
In version two: "'Messenger, repeat the knowledge Allah has given you about the son of the two victims.' The Messenger laughed and they said, 'Who are the two victims?' The Prophet said, 'When Abd al-Muttalib was ordered to dig Zamzam [Not Ishmael or Gabriel?], he vowed that if Allah would make it easy for him, he would sacrifice one of his sons. The choice fell upon Abdallah, but his uncles prevented it, saying, 'Ransom your son with one hundred camels.' So he did that, and Ishmael was the other victim.'" The first boy spared, Abdallah, "Slave-to-Allah," was Muhammad’s father. And as we shall soon see, he botched that story as badly as he did the other.
Tabari II:84 "When Abraham was told to sacrifice Isaac, Satan said, 'By Allah, if I cannot deceive the people with this, I shall never be able to do it.'" Satan not only swears by Allah, he says that the bogus connection between Abraham and Islam is his best way to fool mankind. And he was right!
It’s also interesting that the deception would be over sacrifice. Judaism, Christianity, and all rational civilizations use sacrifice as the means to promote justice and maintain spiritual or societal order. Commit a crime and you will be required to sacrifice your money, your freedom, or your life. If crime is without cost, anarchy reigns. In Judaism, the sacrificial rite for the forgiveness of sin was rich in symbolism. It was based upon the "Mercy Seat" of the Ark of the Covenant. And it was connected prophetically to the blood of an unblemished lamb or dove. It’s all explained in the Torah. In Christianity, Yahshua became the perfect lamb and sacrificed himself on our behalf.
But in Qur'anic Islam, there is no sacrifice. While the Sunnah perpetuates Qusayy's senseless slaughter, it's for appeasement, not atonement. There is no symbolism, no prophetic implication, and no moral reason, as forgiveness is capricious in Islam. And that is why totalitarian governments use draconian measures to maintain order. Muhammad was an amoral thief empowered by situational scriptures, so he failed to appreciate the necessity of sacrifice and he never understood the Biblical concept of sacrificial atonement. It’s why the "ransom of great sacrifice" mentioned in the Qur'an is left unexplained.
Tabari II:87 "Caliph Umar said, 'I asked a former Jew, who was considered to be a great Jewish scholar before he converted to Islam. He said, 'Ishmael, by God, O Prince of Believers. The Jews know that, but they are envious of you Arabs because it was your father who was named in Allah’s command and to whom Allah ascribed such merit.' ' "
Then why do you suppose the prophet said, "When Isaac grew up, Abraham had a dream in which he was told, 'Fulfill your promise that if Allah grants you a son by Sarah you will sacrifice him. [In other words: "If you give me a son I'll kill him for you."] Then he drew the knife across Isaac's throat, but the knife did not scratch him, for Allah had placed a sheet of copper on Isaac's throat. When Abraham saw it he turned him over and tried to cut him on the nape of his neck.' This confirms Allah’s Qur'an: 'When he surrendered, he flung him down upon his face.'" [Qur'an 37:103]
In the next Hadith it's Ishmael: "When Abraham was alone with his son on the trail on Mt. Thabir [a mountain near Mecca], it is said he said to Ishmael, 'O my son, I saw in a dream that I was to sacrifice you. What do you think?' Ishmael told him, 'O my father, Do as you were ordered...and sharpen your knife-blade so that it will finish me off quickly.'"
The tests attributed to Abraham may be the low water mark for Islam’s credibility thus far. This strand of pearls begins to unwind in Tabari's second volume, Prophets and Patriarchs: Tabari II:97 "After Allah had put Abraham to the test - when Nimrod bin Cush tried to burn him in the fire, when He commanded him to sacrifice his son after he had become old enough to walk, when He made him raise the foundations of the House, and devote himself to its rituals - after all of this, He put Abraham to the test with still further commands which He has mentioned. He said, 'And when his Lord tried Abraham with commands and he fulfilled them.' [Qur'an 2:124] The earliest scholars of the Islamic community (ummah) disagreed about the nature of these commandments with which Allah tested Abraham and which Abraham obeyed."
These tests were crucial because Islam - according to Muhammad - was the result of Abraham's obedience. Yet the Qur'an is deficient - completely silent on the nature of these trials and their significance. So rather than let Allah wallow in blissful ignorance, the Companions rushed in to save the day. Tabari II:98 "Islam consists of thirty parts, and no one ever tested with this obligation carried it out, except Abraham." "'And when his Lord tried Abraham with commands' means that Allah tested him with the acts of ritual purification, five in the head and five in the body. [5+5=30] Those in the head are: trimming the mustache, rinsing the mouth, cleansing the nostrils with water, using the toothstick, and parting the hair with the fingers. Those in the body are: paring the nails, shaving the pubic hair, circumcision, plucking the armpit, and washing off traces of feces and urine."
Can't be! Surely this is a misprint. There is no way that the adoptive father of the world's fastest growing religion earned the dubious honor by passing such an inane "test." Let's examine another Hadith to make sure we've got this right. "Allah’s words, 'When his Lord tried Abraham with commands.' mean that Abraham was tested by circumcision, shaving his pubic hair, washing the fore-part and rear, using a toothstick, trimming the mustache, paring nails, and plucking his armpits.'"
That wasn't any better. How about this: Tabari II:99 "Abraham was tested with ten Islamic practices: rinsing the mouth, cleansing the nostrils with water, trimming the mustache, using a toothstick, plucking the armpit, paring the nails, washing finger joints, circumcision, shaving pubic hair, and washing the rear and vulva." So after adding: "bathing on Friday," a fourth version gets ritualistic with: "walking around the Ka'aba, running between Safa and Marwah, stoning pillars, and hurrying." I disdain ritual. I am, therefore, unimpressed with its justification. Ritual is a tool used by power-hungry men to condition the masses and subject them to their rule. It is a control device for the oppressor to use against the ignorant. It separates men from God and discourages rational inquiry. But no ritual has ever been this ridiculous.
Tabari claims that these Hadiths somehow illuminate portions of the 2nd surah. Let's see how: Qur'an 2:118 "Those who are ignorant say: 'Why doesn't Allah speak to us Himself or show us a sign.' So said the people before them. We have indeed shown our clear signs already." Neither Allah nor Muhammad ever bothered to provide any proof of divine inspiration - no signs, no miracles, no prophecies - so this, once again, refers to the miracles of the Bible.
"Lo! We have sent you (Muhammad) with the truth, a bringer of glad tidings and a warner. And you will not be asked about the companions of the Blazing Hell Fire." That's almost funny. Allah is telling Muhammad that he won't be asked about hell. Why then do you suppose hell is the Qur'an's most oft repeated subject?
Qur'an 2:120 "Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with you unless you follow their form of religion. Say: 'The guidance of Allah is Guidance. ... Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it ought to be read." The Qur'an cannot be true and confirm the Bible as Allah claims if Judeo-Christianity is an errant "form of religion." And at this point the Qur'an wasn't remotely complete; it wasn't even written down. Allah was therefore saying that people were doing something that simply couldn't be done. That would make him a liar. What's more, Allah was speaking to an illiterate man - one incapable of reading.
"These [Jews] believe in it; and whoever disbelieves it are losers. Children of Israel, call to mind the special favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I [Allah] preferred you to all others and made you excel the nations." Muhammad was in a pickle. Without the Jews being Yahweh's chosen people, the prophets and scriptures upon which he based Islam lost their relevancy. If they were irrelevant, so was Islam.
Like so much of the Qur'an, this surah provides no intelligent transition between subjects. It has rambled on about god's inability to provide a sign, to telling us that Muhammad was a warner. It flip-flops from telling him not to follow the religion of the Jews to calling the Jews God’s chosen people. Then after condemning Yahshua's mission and crucifying Muhammad’s credibility in the process, it moves to a revisionist account of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. Qur'an 2:124 "And (remember) when Abraham's Lord tried him with (certain) commands, which he fulfilled: He said: 'I will make you an Imam [Islamic leader] to the Nations.' He pleaded: 'And also Imams from my offspring!' He answered: 'But My Promise does not include evil-doers.'" The nature of the trials, or commands, which Abraham allegedly fulfilled was not listed. Considering that the passage of these trials made Abraham the father of Islam - the Imam of the nations - the omission was serious. Not surprisingly, it sent the Muslim sages scurrying for answers. Sadly, what we just reviewed was the best they could do. The Noble Qur'an translators even include this Hadith: Bukhari:V7B72N779 "I heard the Prophet saying, 'Five practices are characteristics of the Fitra [religion of Abraham]: circumcision, shaving the pubic hair, cutting the moustaches short, clipping the nails, and depilating the hair of the armpits.'" This "religion" can't be fixed. It needs to be discarded.
Every Biblical story quoted in the Qur'an was designed to make Muhammad’s unprophet-like behavior seem religious or to make Islamic rituals seem sane. The next verse was no exception. Qur'an 2:125 "Remember when We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of safety; and the place Abraham stood to pray; and We covenanted with Abraham and Ishmael that they should sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, use it as a retreat, bow down, prostrating themselves."
Qur'an 2:126 "And remember [This is an odd command. What are they remembering this from? The Bible doesn't say anything remotely like this, and no other scriptures refer to Abraham.] Abraham said: 'My Lord, make this a City of Peace, and feed its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day.'" Even this is odd. Muhammad was verbally attacked during the entire time he preached in Mecca. As a result, he attacked Mecca militarily at the end of his career, putting him in direct opposition to the patriarch's supposed prophecy.
"He said: 'As for those who reject, indulge them; soon I will compel them to the doom of the torment of Hell Fire, an evil destination!'" To compel is to induce or coerce. Why would God want to act like Satan and coerce someone into hell?
Qur'an 2:127 "Remember, Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House: 'Our Lord! Accept this service from us.'" While I realize that no one was writing this stuff down, and that a short pencil is more effective than a long memory, god and his prophet ought to be able to do better. Just two verses earlier Allah said that he had made the House. Next we learn: "'Our Lord, make of us Muslims, submissive to Your (will), and of our offspring a nation of Muslims, bowing to You; and show us our place for the celebration of rites.'" Abraham died 2,600 years before the first Muslim was conned into Islam. In fact, the Arabic word for Muslim wouldn't even be coined for twenty-six centuries.
Yet a nation of Muslims is how Muhammad viewed the world. The prophet saw our planet in two pieces - the Nation of Islam (called Dar us-Islam) and lands yet to submit, the House of War (called Dar us-Harb). And while Islam has been at war with itself for all of its thirteen centuries, it will continue to fight the House of War until we capitulate. Many in the Western media and most politicians claim that the war on terrorism is unlike any other because the terrorists come from many nations. Now you know the truth: the terrorists represent one nation - the Nation of Islam.
Qur'an 2:129 "Our Lord, raise up in their midst a Messenger from among them who shall recite to them Your revelations, and instruct them in the Book and in wisdom and make them grow." By the time the second surah was "revealed" Muhammad had fled Mecca for the safety of Medina. Now in close proximity with Jews, he had a problem. These folks were literate, and as a result, they were harder to fool. They undoubtedly told Muhammad that he couldn't be God’s final messenger because that role belonged to the Messiah. Moreover, there were hundreds of specific prophecies regarding the Messiah, none of which he met. So what do you suppose the wannabe Messiah did? Right. He made one up.
But for it to be believable, he had to revise Abraham first: Qur'an 2:130 "He who turns away from the religion of Abraham makes himself a fool with folly." Abraham did not have a religion. He had a relationship. There were no rituals, rites, prostrations, pilgrimages, or prescribed prayers. In fact, the word "religion" doesn't exist in the Torah. It can't be found even once in all of the Old Covenant. Qur'an 2:131 "When his Lord said to him, 'Be a Muslim.' he said: 'I submit [Islam] to the Lord of the worlds.'" Likewise, you won't find the words Muslim, submit, or Islam.
The revisionist Abraham said, "Our Lord, make us submissive [Islam] to You and make of our seed a nation [of Muslims]. And show us our ways of worship." If Abraham received scrolls from Allah and performed the Islamic rituals, he could not have asked, "Show me the ways of worship."
"You, only You, are the Relenting. Our Lord, raise up in their midst a messenger." You can almost hear Muhammad cry, "I'm that man." Jesus has been demoted and Abraham promoted so that Abe could vouch for the credentials of Muhammad and thereby silence the prophet's critics.
Muhammad believes that Allah chose Islam for Abraham and his sons, especially Jacob, from whom all Jews are descended..'" Why do you suppose Yahweh trifled with Judaism and Christianity if Abe were a Muslim? And could Abraham have referred to God as Allah if the name wouldn't be invented for more than twenty centuries? Even then, it was the proper name of a pagan rock idol in Arabia, not Israel. How do you suppose Yahweh's name could have been repeated 6,868 times in the Bible if his name were really Allah? And there is no way to weasel out of this predicament. Muslims scream that "Allah" is simply the Arabic word for "God," yet that assertion is in direct conflict with the Qur'an. In this verse the Arabic word for "God" (capital "G"), "Ilah," was used three times.
Alright, now that we've turned Jews into Muslims it's time to condemn them. Qur'an 2:134 "Those are people whose nation has passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, They say: 'Become Jews or Christians if you would be guided.' Say (Muhammad): 'Nay! Only the Religion of Abraham the Hanif. He was not a Mushrikun [non-Muslim disbeliever].'" The Qur'an says nothing of the religion of Abraham. It only suggests prostrations and rituals - mindless drivel. Since the world's best-documented faiths are Judaism and Christianity, and their Bible introduced Abraham to the world, you'd think that Islam would at least try. But no, all we get is feeble justification for a sorry mix of pre-existing pagan rites.
"Hanifs" were monotheistic poets. While they inspired Islam’s first score of surahs, they were not Muslims. We will discuss them in upcoming chapters.
Qur'an 2:136 "Say (Muslims): 'We believe in Allah and that which is revealed to us and that which was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the (twelve Jewish) tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered (in Islam).'" You'd think that after 1,400 years, some bright Muslim would ask, "What was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, and Jacob?" If Allah knows, why is he keeping it a secret? Or, why not ask, "If we Muslims shouldn't make any distinction between the revelations Moses and Jesus received and those claimed by Muhammad, why was Islam necessary?"
If they were without distinction this cannot be true: "If they believe as you believe they are rightly guided; but if they turn away they are in great opposition. Allah will suffice you against them." Allah says the revelations are identical - Judaism's, Christianity's, and Islam’s, and then he says "they are in great opposition."
There is some good news. The Islamic god was a self-indulgent fool: Qur'an 2:138 "(Our religion is) the Baptism of Allah: And who can baptize better than Allah?" Not only is Allah a Jew, he's a Baptist. And while that's embarrassing, the symbolism is deadly for Islam. Muslims don't baptize, and that's a problem if their religion is the Baptism of Allah - especially since he's the best Baptiser.
Baptism by water is the outward expression of having chosen Yahshua as one's savior. It is symbolic of receiving his Spirit - the spirit of Yahweh. While the Holy Spirit is something that the Qur'an both acknowledges and condemns, He, like the Torah, Gospels, and Yahshua, plays no part in Islam. Allah is a distant god. His spirit does not reside in man.
While we turned to this surah in an effort to connect Traditions regarding Abraham to Allah’s account in the Qur'an, we have hit a veritable goldmine of Islamic blunders. This may be the most grotesque of all. Qur'an 2:139 "Say (unto the People of the Scripture [Christians and Jews]): Will you dispute with us about Allah, seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord?" Muslims, in a desperate grope for credibility, are being told that Yahweh and Allah are the same god. It is hard to imagine a more vulgar lie. Yahweh and Allah are love and lust, redemption and punishment, personal and remote, brilliant and dimwitted, peace and terror. They are as different as their scriptures.
Yet this deception is essential to Islam. If Allah isn't Yahweh, Muhammad is a liar and the Qur'an is lunacy. There is no other justification for Muhammad’s reliance on Genesis and Exodus. Muslims must reconcile the irreconcilable, bridging the chasm between Yahweh's and Allah’s wholly divergent characters. It is a desperate battle for survival that Islam cannot win.
The infinitesimal chance Islam had of prevailing with this ridiculous assertion evaporated when the Dead Sea scrolls were discovered. The text and message on those uncorrupted scrolls rendered impossible the comprehensive corruption and conspiracy that would have been necessary to make the doctrines and gods similar, much less the same.
Qur'an 2:140 "Nay! Do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do you know better than Allah? Who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they received from Allah?" If this weren't so stupid it would be funny. Allah is saying that Christians and Jews call Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, "Jews and Christians," as if they knew more about them than Allah. Well, apparently they do. Abraham wasn't strictly speaking, a Jew. He was a Chaldean from Ur as was his wife Sarah. Anyone who has bothered to read Genesis knows that. But Allah was illiterate, just like Muhammad. Reading Genesis was therefore beyond him. Ishmael was the bastard child of an Egyptian slave. He was expressly excluded from Yahweh's covenant with the Jews. No Jew or Christian would ever claim relations with him. Isaac, Abraham's miracle son, provided the link between Abraham and Jacob. Jacob was the father of the twelve tribes and was therefore a Jew - the Jew. And last time I checked, the tribes of Israel were Jews, not Christians. The first Christian wouldn't be born for twenty centuries.
By this time it should be abundantly clear - Allah wasn't God. The dark spirit of Islam wasn't even sane. Qur'an 2:141 "The fools among the people will say: 'What has turned them from the Qiblah [the direction Muslims face in prayer] to which they formerly observed [facing Jerusalem]?'" Following the Satanic Verses, Ka'aba worship was on the rocks, so Muhammad had Muslims pray to a substitute shrine - the only holy site in the Bible - the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. But that didn't last because the Jews began disputing his preposterous claims of prophethood. Something had to be done. The answer was simple enough. Muslims were ordered to turn away from Jerusalem and to bow toward the House that Allah-Adam-Abraham built.
"We appointed the Qiblah which you were used to, as a hard test for those who followed the Messenger. Indeed it was a momentous change, except to those guided by Allah." I don't suppose anyone bothered to ask why bowing one direction versus another in ritualistic prayer was such a tough test. I would think that twisting one's prayer blankie might be sufficient. Why go to all the trouble to twist the Torah?
Qur'an 2:144 "Turn your face in the direction of the sacred Mosque [the Ka'aba]. Wherever you are, turn your faces in that direction. The people of the Book know well that this revelation is the truth from their Lord." Allah is saying that the Jews and Christians know that the Ka'aba is of paramount importance to Judeo-Christianity. Further, he is protesting that the Jews and Christians have collaborated in a massive cover-up to keep the true importance of the pagan shrine a secret. Frankly, I am stunned that something this obviously false and foolish could be considered godly by anyone.
Implicit in this farce is that the Judeo-Christian focus on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem is bogus. For this to be true, the entire Bible, starting with Genesis 11 running through Revelation 22, would have to be fundamentally flawed, for virtually every page is rooted in the history of Israel, and focused on Jerusalem. To say that Jews and Christians conspired to artificially elevate the importance of Israel, Jerusalem, and the Temple at the expense of Mecca, a town that didn't even exist during the two thousand years the scriptures were being written - in all sixty-six books of the Bible - is ludicrous.
Yet the stakes are unimaginably high. If Allah’s contention is wrong, then Islam’s foundation is ripped asunder. All of the corrupted Biblical accounts in the world won't help. If the Islamic connection to the Hebrew prophets and patriarchs falters, every important aspect of Muhammad’s religion fails: Allah isn't god; Muhammad isn't a prophet. And if they aren't who they claim they are, they aren't worthy of anyone's prayers, allegiance, or soul.
Therein lies the tale - the ticking time bomb of Islam. There is no room for an Arab prophet with a wholly divergent message, especially one without miracles or prophecies, in the line of Hebrews. The last messenger of the scriptures is undeniably the Messiah, not Muhammad.
That gave the Messenger of Islam several enormous problems. He had to claim that the Messianic prophecies were corrupted and meaningless - an impossible task. He had to ignore the fact that the Messiah Yahshua fulfilled them - a fool's folly (one sadly shared by the Jews). Then he had to somehow distort Bible stories and characters to such an extent that it made his unprophet-like behavior and ridiculous pagan rites seem religious, rational, moral, and inspired. But that led to a new problem. How does one do that without debasing the faith upon which the new religion is based?
It can't be done - at least not rationally. But Islam has never been popular with rational people. It is like an acid, corroding everything it touches, eating away at the brain and heart. It corrupts men, turning them into unthinking, mindless murderers in pursuit of lustful pleasures. It causes Muslims to be so fearful of the truth, they threaten to kill anyone willing to expose their lie.
Muhammad wasn't finished telling his faithful that the Jews and the Christians had collaborated in the greatest hoax in all of recorded history. Qur'an 2:146 "The people of the Book recognize him as they know their own sons; but some of them conceal the truth which they themselves know." Muhammad’s "god" is saying on behalf of his "prophet" that the Jews recognized Muhammad as the Messiah but were keeping it a secret. He was evidently counting on everyone being illiterate and naïve. And judging by the numbers of people he fooled, he may have been right.
The trials and tribulations of Dishonest Abe, also known as a figment of Muhammad’s imagination, end where they began - by ripping off a well-documented Bible story. Tabari II:111 "Lot bin Haran bin Terah, son of Abraham's brother, and his people, the folks of Sodom, traveled from Babylon following their religion. They went to Syria as fugitives with Sarah. It is said that Terah, Abraham's father, went with them." Yes, Terah was Abe's dad, not Azar, like the Traditions have been insisting. And yes, they were close when they said that they left Babylon. It was actually Ur, a hundred miles south. And yes, the troop included Lot and Sarah. They were not, however, fugitives, they had no religion, and the people of Sodom were not with them. Lot would eventually live in Sodom, but that wouldn't occur for a couple of thousand miles and many years.
"Terah died. Abraham, Lot and Sarah went on to Syria and then to Egypt, which was then ruled by a Pharaoh named Sinan bin Al-wan bin Ubayd bin Uwayj bin Imlaq bin Lud bin Shem bin Noah. He was the brother of Dahhak/Nimrod, who had appointed him governor of Egypt." These boys would have been so much better off if they had just stuck with the Biblical account rather than drumming up this nonsense. Truth is, they would have been better off if they had just stuck with Judaism and never perverted it into Islam - and so would we.
"After this, Abraham, Lot and Sarah went back to Syria and settled in Palestine. Allah sent Lot to the people of Sodom. They were disbelievers in Allah and immoral. Allah said, 'You commit lewdness such as no creature before. You come into males, cut the roads, and commit abominations in your assemblies.'" [Qur'an 29:28] Allah, please, watch the language. They have a perfectly good word for that male thing. It’s called homosexuality. As for the lewdness, they have a word for that too. And even you should know it - as it was named after the town. But as for "cutting the roads," I'm at a loss.
Fortunately, Muslim sages are ever ready to enlighten us. Tabari II:112 "Allah’s statement, 'you cut the roa' means: When the traveler, the son of the road, passed by they would block the road and perform with him that ugly deed.... Some say that they used to shorten whoever passed by. Other say that they used to break wind in their assemblies, while some said that they used to have intercourse with each other there.... Some Islamic scholars agree, while others differ. The abomination was breaking wind." I wonder if that was why Allah taught Adam about "the fart and the little fart?" It may have been why Muhammad revealed this pearl in Bukhari's Book of Wudu: Bukhari:V1B4N139 "He asked Allah’s Messenger about a person who imagined to have passed wind during the Salat prayer. Allah’s Messenger replied: 'He should not leave his Salat unless he hears sound or smells something.'" You see, Islam can be tolerant.
Others say: "They would accost a rider and seize him and mount him," explains surah 29:28. Or: "Allah’s statement refers to the fact that no male jumped upon a male before the people of Lot." Then you have Muhammad’s version: "The Messenger of God said, 'And you commit abominations in your assemblies means they would cut off wayfarers and mock them, and that was the abomination that they committed.'" Horror of horrors! Being mocked was Muhammad’s curse in life. Virtually everyone he encountered berated him.
The Messenger had a lot to say about Lot. Although Lot never preached a day in his life and was the furthest thing from a prophet, the temptation to transform him into a mini-Muhammad was too great to pass up. Tabari II:115 "Lot called on them to worship Allah. By Allah’s command he tried to prohibit them from doing those things which Allah disliked such as brigandage, committing lewd acts, and entering males in the posteriors. Because they persisted, he threatened them with painful doom. They rejected his admonitions, saying to him 'Bring Allah’s doom upon us, if you are telling the truth!'" I could have sworn that we've heard this story before.
"At length Lot asked his Lord for help against them, since the matter was dragging on, as was their persistence in sinfulness. Then Allah - when he wanted to disgrace them and destroy them and help His Messenger Lot against them - sent Gabriel and two other angels. It had been said that the two other angels were Michael and Israfil." Every word of this was loaded, chosen specifically to distress Muhammad’s Meccan tormentors. "Mess with me and my god will get you."
Tabari II:120 "Gabriel picked up their land with his wing and turned it over. He lifted it so high the inhabitants of heaven heard the crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs. He turned them upside down and rained upon them stones of clay." [Qur'an 15:74]
The 15th surah says: . The dwellers of the Rock rejected the messengers."
Allah is daring us to use his depiction of Sodom as a proof of his divinity. But Sodom wasn't turned upside down, it wasn't stoned with clay, nor was it ever close enough to heaven for the angelic host to hear the roosters. And the roads have long since disappeared. We know that because archeologists have found Sodom, Gomorrah, and the other cities of the plain. And guess what? They are exactly where the Bible said they would be. They were destroyed exactly when the Bible said that they were destroyed. And yes, they were buried exactly how the Bible proclaimed - under brimstone. Once again, the Bible was precisely accurate and the Muhammad/Allah team couldn't even plagiarize it without burying themselves.
Some of the lowlights of the versions that follow include: Tabari II:121 "Gabriel spread out his wings and gouged out their eyes." "Then Allah took them to Syria." Which is odd because that's where we were told they were in the first place.
This next one is a hoot. There are more errors than sentences. "Gabriel seized its girdle, then snatched it up so high into the sky that the angels could hear their dogs. He threw rocks at the laggards, one after the other. There were three towns called Sodom that lay between Medina and Syria. It has been mentioned that there were four million people in the town." Four thousand, maybe. They all had different names, like Gomorrah, and they were unearthed on the shores of the Dead Sea.
Muhammad’s convoluted story of Lot is repeated a half dozen times in different surahs and that many times again in the Traditions. It’s no wonder it was the prophet's personal favorite. He had the opportunity to turn a nobody into a messenger whose people got pummeled because they mocked him.
We leave Volume II of Tabari with these stirring words, "O Messenger! How many books did Allah reveal? He said, 'One hundred and four books. To Adam He revealed ten leaves, to Seth fifty leaves, and to Enoch thirty leaves. To Abraham he revealed ten leaves and also the Torah, Gospel, the Zabur, and the Rurqan.'" Oops. Even Allah knows better. The Torah wasn't written until the time of Moses. But what makes this statement particularly lame is that eighty-five percent of the Torah chronicles the history of people who lived after Abraham died.
Tabari II:130 "I said, 'O Messenger! What were the books of Abraham.' He answered, 'They were all proverbs such as, 'O dominated, afflicted and deceived king! I did not send you to collect all the world, one part to another, rather I sent you so that I would not have to hear the cry of the oppressed.'" If they were all that feeble, it's little wonder no one other than the illiterate messenger ever read them.

Free as in Freedom episode 0x03
Karen and Bradley discuss the debates regarding Apple's online store restrictions that make it impossible to distribute GPL'd software via Apple's store. Then, they discuss question the usefulness of the term “Open Core”Running time: 00:45:04.
Show Notes
Note: Bradley's audio was too low compared to Karen's on this episode. We're still sorting out our recording issues, and apologize for this. This is completely Bradley's fault: don't blame Producer Dan. :)
Segment 0 (00:34)
- Karen mentioned first Brett's statement on the VLC mailing list, although that is toward the end of the story that was covered last month. (05:30)
- Bradley mentioned that the story started with FSF's enforcement regarding Apple's distribution of GNU Go in Apple's application store. (05:54)
- Don't confused GNU Go (the game) with Google Go (the programming language). Bradley pointed out that Google did assign some of its copyright on the language Go, for the GCC frontend for the Go language. (06:51)
- Bradley mentioned that the game Go has been around thousands of years, although according the Go Wikipedia entry, it's been around for approximately 2,500 years. (08:21)
- Bradley pointed out that the primary goal of GPL enforcement is to get compliance, not to get companies to cease distribution, but sometimes the companies prefer to cease distribution rather than complying with the license. (09:57)
- There was disagreement in the VLC community about the enforcement action (11:50). There's an original thread on the VLC mailing list that discussed this (12:35), and then Brett's response on that list. (13:25)
- GPLv2 requires in § 6 that you cannot impose terms that restrict the downstream more than GPL otherwise does. (15:40)
- FSF made a statement that linked this issue to the DRM issue, which caused some confusion. It's our view that what Apple is doing against GPL software is part of their initiative to put DRM (both for software and more traditional content) onto devices. (17:20)
- Bradley mentioned that Apple lawyers have a pathological hatred of GPL, which he believes comes directly down from Steve Jobs, who began his dislike of GPL when he tried, while at NeXT, to distribute a proprietary front-end for GCC for Objective-C. (RMS discussed the story briefly in his essay Copyleft: Pragmatic Idealism.) (23:45)
Segment 1 (27:40)
- Bradley has decided that the term “Open Core” is so confusing that it's now useless.
- The Gnus IMAP backend is being rewritten, and Joel Adamson mentioned that he's using Emacs development mainline and the new IMAP implementation is working well. (29:58)
- Alexandre Oliva started a project called Linux Libre, to remove proprietary software from Linux. (31:31)
- There is a file called WHENCE in Linux that is a long list of proprietary software included inside Linux. Richard Fontana linked the WHENCE file on identi.ca (31:02)
- Alexandre made an announcement calling Linux an “Open Core” project. (32:56)
- Bradley mentioned that Alexandre appears to have been convinced that Open Core is a problematic term in this context (during this identica conversation). Alexandre seems to be favoring the term “Free Bait” now. (35:16)
- Karen mentioned Nina Paley's intellectual pooperty cartoon. (38:39)
- Bradley mentioned the
softer side of Searsmarketing campaign, which was used as a cruel joke by Cordelia in the pilot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to make fun of Willow's clothes. Sears apparently dropped the campaign in 1999. (40:23)

Happy Blogiversary to So, How’s It Taste! Can you believe it’s been three years? THREE years since my first post. I almost don’t believe it. Looking back at my first and second year blogiversaries, I detect a chocolate theme. This should come as no surprise to any of my readers. I love chocolate! Last year I celebrated with Dark Chocolate Souffles that were figure-friendly. Um, so not the case this year. I’ve done a complete 180 and will celebrate the big 3 with Chocolate-Covered Key Lime Pie. I’m pretty sure these aren’t anywhere close to being kind to your waistline!
So, how’s it taste?
Pretty freakin’ fantastic! What’s not to love? A creamy, tart, sweet slice of key lime pie surrounded in chocolate. You may think citrus and chocolate is an odd combination, but trust me on this one. This particular Key Lime Pie recipe is perfect for freezing and covering in chocolate. It doesn’t get rock hard when it’s frozen, so once you crack through that layer of chocolate, your teeth just sink into creamy lime goodness. I covered some slices in semi-sweet chocolate and some in dark chocolate. I don’t know which I liked best, they were both really good.
I think the slices are quite huge, so find a buddy to share with you. The pie is pretty rich on its own, so covered in chocolate would put even a chocoholic like me in a serious sugar coma. I think slicing the pie into 16 slices would have been more practical. Instead of dipping the slices into chocolate, I chose to “frost” them with chocolate. Dipping would require melting way too much chocolate and probably wasting it, too, and I don’t waste chocolate in my house. Holding the slice by the popsicle stick made it easy to frost it with an offset spatula. I figured out about 1/2 cup of morsels will frost one slice of this size.
Since the slices are so big, a great way to serve this is to cut the slices into almost bite-sized chunks. I put the chunks in cupcake liners and took them to work that way. Perfect for everyone to have a piece or two!
__________
I want to say thank you to everyone that reads this little ol’ blog of mine. It started out as nothing special and has grown into something I’m extremely proud of. It’s cool to have an archive of all my posts and see how I’ve grown throughout the years. Not to mention the great friends and people I’ve met and keep meeting along the way thanks to our mutual love of food. Your support means the world and encourages me to continue to share my eating adventures in and out of the kitchen…and of course to answer the question “so, how’s it taste?”
Chocolate-Covered Key Lime Pie
Ingredients:
1 recipe Key Lime Pie with Pretzel Crust
8 popsicle sticks
4 cups chocolate morsels (semi-sweet, dark, or milk chocolate)
Almond bark
Directions:
1. Prepare Key Lime Pie with Pretzel Crust and let set in refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours.
2. Slice pie into 8 equal portions. Pretzel crust may be a little crumbly and some may come off, but that's ok.
3. Place slices onto a sheet lined with parchment paper and gently push in a popsicle stick about halfway. Leave some space on the sheet in between slices. Freeze for about 6 hours.
4. For covering each slice with chocolate, it's best to work in batches of two slices at a time. Microwave 1 cup of morsels for 30 seconds on high. Stir and microwave for another 30 seconds. Microwave in 15-second intervals if the morsels aren't completely melted. Using a small offset spatula, spread the melted morsels all around the pie slice, holding the stick for support. When the entire slice is covered, place it back on the sheet with parchment paper and return to the freezer. Continue with the remaining slices.
5. Place one square of almond bark in a plastic sandwich bag. Microwave in 30-second intervals, kneading the bag in between until the almond bark is smooth. Snip the corner of the bag with scissors and pipe onto chocolate-covered pie slices. Return to the freezer until ready to serve.

A 25-year-old Lusby man is being held by police in connection with the suspected murder of a 27-year-old Lusby woman, who police say was his girlfriend.
John Warren Gibson Jr. led police Friday morning to a wooded area south of Leonardtown in St. Mary’s County, where police said in a press release they found the body of Amanda Lynn Foster in a trash can in the woods. Gibson allegedly told police the couple had been involved in a fight Jan. 12 at the home they shared on San Jose Lane in Lusby. During the fight, Gibson allegedly stabbed Foster in the chest, then placed her body in a trash can, loaded it into her truck and drove to St. Mary’s County where he hid the trash can in the woods near Breton Bay.
Police said in a press release they began the investigation after receiving a call from a concerned family member Jan. 31 at 8:11 p.m. Foster’s family had not heard from the victim in several weeks and attempts to reach her by phone were unsuccessful. Troopers from the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack went to her home to try and talk to her. No one was at the San Jose Lane home, but troopers learned her truck had been seen parked at a home on H.G. Trueman Road in Lusby. Troopers went to the H.G. Trueman residence and spoke with Gibson, who told troopers he had dropped Foster off at a convenience store in California, Md., and had not heard from her since.
Det. Rich of the Calvert Investigative Team was called in to assist in the investigation. Police said Gibson gave them conflicting information in his account of recent events and he was taken to CIT offices for questioning. Additional CIT personnel, Sgt. Jones, Sgt. Naughton, Tfc. Hunt and Det. Mudd, were called to assist in conducting the investigation.
Police said during Gibson’s interview, he told police about the argument and the alleged homicide. He allegedly then took investigators this morning to the location of the body in the woods south of Leonardtown. CIT investigators met with troopers and deputies from the St. Mary’s County Bureau of Criminal Investigations at the scene. Foster’s body was recovered and taken to the Maryland Medical Examiner’s Office in Baltimore for an autopsy.
Rich with the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office and Sgt. Jones with MSP are continuing the investigation. Anyone with additional information can contact them at 410-535-1600, ext. 2765 or ext. 2455.

Charles County’s proposed land use map, mandated by the so-called “septic bill,” probably violates state law, the Maryland Department of Planning concluded in a report released Friday.
On Monday, MDP elaborated in a letter to county government, warning that the map does not protect environmentally sensitive land and permits “sprawl” development that could make it difficult to develop an effective mass transit system for the county’s urban areas.
The map, drafted as required by the Sustainable Growth and Agricultural Preservation Act of 2012, divides all land in the county into four tiers based on septic system and sewer use. The law also bans the building of large subdivisions in areas designated for conservation.
The county was supposed to submit its map to the state by the end of last year, but the draft is still before the Charles County commissioners. However, Charles County is not alone, according to the MDP report, which states that 12 counties had not adopted maps by Friday. Among that 12, Charles, Howard and Washington counties “have proposed tier maps for public discussion that largely do not conform to the law,” the report states, adding that if the “draft tier maps are adopted without change, significant environmental and agricultural impacts from septic development will occur.”
MDP’s concerns about Charles County’s proposal focus on the inclusion of land in Tier III, where major subdivisions can be built on septic systems, which MDP asserts should be in Tier IV, or conservation areas, where new major subdivisions are banned altogether.
The proposed map designates 65,000 fewer acres, generally fields and forest, for conservation than did a proposal by county staff. The change preserves landowners’ ability to build major subdivisions on the land.
“MDP attended numerous public meetings leading up to the development of three land use scenarios created by County staff. It was promising that the County was taking steps to implement many of the policies included in the County’s previous plans. We were surprised to find that this draft reverses many policies that support land conservation as well as smart growth principles,” states the letter, which was addressed to Peter Aluotto, Charles County director of the Department of Planning and Growth Management.
Some county officials said they agreed with MDP’s assessment, while others insisted that the map is legal as written.
The map adoption process has been “disturbing to me, and embarrassing,” said county Commissioners’ President Candice Quinn Kelly (D), especially because the Charles County Planning Commission adopted a map proposed by the Balanced Growth Initiative, which calls itself a property rights group, instead of the map proposed by county staff. She said she would not vote to approve the BGI draft as written.
Commissioner Ken Robinson (D) agreed, saying no special-interest group should have that much influence, regardless of its orientation.
“I would certainly not wish to associate myself, as a commissioner, with the map that the planning commission sent to us. First of all, it was presented and adopted by a special-interest group, and I think that’s inappropriate. ... I would feel just as uncomfortable with a map presented by an outside special-interest group if they were an environmental group. It’s not just that the Balanced Growth Initiative is a developer group,” Robinson said.
But Commissioner Reuben B. Collins II (D) said the situation was not so clear and asserted that a private attorney hired by the commissioners to give advice about the map declared it “well within the confines of the law.” Kelly and Robinson said they would not comment about a private discussion, though Kelly said Collins’ account was incorrect.
The septic bill is difficult to interpret, and MDP is interfering in a local land use decision, Collins continued.
“I question the objectivity of the state in that it kind of weighed in on this process prematurely. In SB 236 [the septic bill], it certainly allows for the state to comment, but that’s after the jurisdiction has absolutely approved a tier map. ... There is some virtue, I believe, in what the state is attempting to accomplish,” Collins said, but MDP shouldn’t yet be “weighing in on a local matter.”
Commissioners Debra M. Davis (D) and Bobby Rucci (D) did not return calls seeking comment.
Members of the Charles County Planning Commission, a majority of which opted to endorse the BGI map, also were split on its legality.
Planning commission Chairman Courtney Edmonds, who unsuccessfully opposed the draft plan, said at least two of his colleagues voted for it out of pique.
“The motion to pass the proposed tier map wasn’t based on the conclusion that the proposed map met the requirements of state law. Rather, Mr. [Joseph] Richard and Mr. [Lou] Grasso made the motion merely because they objected to the fact that the [county] planning and growth management department didn’t come back with what they wanted. And [the two men] expressed disagreement with SB 236 in the first place. So, it’s not surprising to me that MDP found it to be noncompliant,” Edmonds said.
Richard agreed that the planning commission majority had been displeased with county staff for not presenting a map that followed its dictates. But the planning commission adopted the BGI map because it came closest to what the commission desired all along, he continued, while county staff’s map was essentially identical to what MDP wanted.
“The map that the planning commission submitted to the county commissioners, at least from our perspective, meets the intent of SB 236,” Richard said.
MDP’s perspective, as expressed in the report, is basically identical to that of environmentalists, Richard said, something he attributed to the clout of groups like the Sierra Club and 1000 Friends of Maryland in Annapolis. Both groups have actively opposed Charles County’s draft map.
The law gives the state very little power to enforce its desires on counties anyway, Richard said, so Charles County has little to worry about. He dismissed fears that agencies could retaliate by cutting off funding for infrastructure because those processes are separate, he said.
“The idea MDP can wave a wand and no longer fund schools and roads [is wrong]. You can’t do that. There’s [funding] formulas. It’s just going to be impossible. I think that’s a lot of wishful thinking, trying to intimidate the less informed. ... I don’t respond well to threats, and I don’t think the county commissioners respond well to threats as well,” Richard said.
Grasso declined to comment Monday.

Charles County school system staff anticipate that more than 800 school children will be homeless by year’s end.
As requested by school board members at a previous meeting, the system’s hearing officer Karen Kunkel updated the board Tuesday on homeless students in county schools.
In June, there were 618 homeless children in schools, and as of Tuesday, Kunkel said, that number had increased to 796.
Kunkel said the increase in homeless children is not unique to Charles County and that numbers are increasing throughout the state.
While the economy plays a large role, Kunkel said many factors play into the increase, including a nine-year waitlist for Section 8 federally subsidized housing and no transitional housing available for children in the region.
“When someone is displaced, they have nowhere to go,” she said.
An elementary school student who was shadowing the school board Tuesday asked Kunkel what classifies a student as homeless.
Kunkel explained that a student counted as homeless does not always not have a roof over his head.
She said a person becomes homeless when a situation forces someone to be displaced from their home.
This could be due to many situations, including a loss of a job, domestic violence or a fire.
“Most times, it’s a sudden emergency, a fire or loss of job,” Kunkel said.
The federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 2002 mandates protections for homeless children. The school system receives funds through the act to provide resources and assistance for homeless students.
The act defines a homeless student as “an individual who lacks a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence.”
Kunkel said one thing that sticks out regarding the school system’s population is the amount of children participating in Safe Nights.
Safe Nights, sponsored by LifeStyles of Maryland in Charles County, is a program that provides temporary shelter at county churches during the coldest months of the year.
Kunkel said that this year, there have been as few as two and as many as 12 children participating in the program each night.
Pupil personnel workers in the school system provide transportation for children participating in Safe Nights to get to school.
Kunkel said this is the first year since the program has been in operation that there have been children every night.
She said the question staff ask themselves is whether the system is providing what it can for students.
“I can tell you confidently that we are,” she said.
Through various programs and resources, Kunkel said, the idea is to give those who are not as advantaged as other students “a level playing field.”
Restrictions on releasing information about homeless students are very stringent, she said, adding that no one should be able to walk down a hallway at school, pass a child and be able to tell whether the child is homeless.
“We will supply whatever the child needs,” she said.
The school system works with a $33,000 budget for the children, and Kunkel said, “We make it work for us down to the very last penny.”
In addition to budgeted funds, students receive help through Title I opportunities and partnerships with outside agencies.
The Title I and homeless education offices of the schools work together to make sure student needs are met, parents are involved under Title I parent involvement policies and staff of both offices receive training on Title I and homeless education.
The Title I program provides federal funds to school districts with high proportions of disadvantaged students.
The funds go to schools, designated as meeting the requirements under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, based on the income level of students. Funds go toward technology and resources.
There are six Title I schools in Charles County: Eva Turner, Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, C. Paul Barnhart, J.P. Ryon, Indian Head and Mount Hope/Nanjemoy elementary schools.
The program provides funds for students 3 years old through fifth grade.
Student who do not attend a Title 1 school and are homeless are automatically eligible for Title 1 services.
Kunkel said the school system also has an “outstanding working relationship with county partners.”
For example, with the help of outside agencies, the school system is able to provide meals for students during the summer.
Board member Jennifer S. Abell asked if there was anything more the board could do to help the situation.
Kunkel said the board has been supportive and the relationships with county agencies are strong, so all that could be asked is that board members help by being advocates and promoting the recognition of those in need.
Charles County Superintendent of Schools James E. Richmond said the school system and county agencies have come together and “put what they could in the pot” to help those in need.
“We need to keep that going,” he said.

More than half a million dollars in education funding to St. Mary’s County could be in jeopardy if Congress does not avert sequestration cuts to the federal budget before next week’s deadline.
St. Mary’s public school administrators are bracing for funding cuts that could include money to special education federal funding and schools serving a high proportion of low-income students.
Services provided by Head Start, the federal preschool program for children from low-income families administered by a local agency, could also be reduced if sequestration goes through.
Funding for these programs in St. Mary’s could be reduced by 8 percent at the start of the next fiscal year, said Greg Nourse, assistant superintendent of fiscal services and human resources. If Congress decides later to avoid the cuts, funding could be restored.
If sequestration occurs, as much as $3 billion of the $85 billion in spending cuts ordered could be to education funding across the country. It would also cut■$42.7 billion from the military budget, a 9.4 percent cut, which is expected to have a deep impact on work at Patuxent River Naval Air Station and its associated military contractors.
For the St. Mary’s schools, an 8 percent reduction in federal education spending would cut about half a million dollars from the approximately $6.4 million coming to St. Mary’s from the federal government. Another approximately $2 million that comes to local schools in the form of federal impact aid based on the number of students connected with the military is also at risk.
Nourse said he is worried about the negative effect on tax revenue to the local government if the cuts go through to the defense industry, since Pax River is the county’s economic driver.
Four local public elementary schools received most of the $2.3 million in Title I funding directed to schools to help economically disadvantaged children. Another $736,000 in Title II funding for professional development for teachers is also at risk.
“I have done a sequestration budget” based on an 8 percent cut to Title I funding, said Kelly Hall, executive director of elementary schools and Title I. “This is an impure science at this moment.”
She said her alternative budget would spare full-time teachers and paraeducators who are employed by the school system, but that the 12 to 15 temporary workers hired could be at risk of losing their jobs if sequestration goes through.
Other areas of Title I that could be cut or reduced include materials of instruction, including technology, professional development and after-school programs, Hall said.
“We are preparing for this as a worst-case scenario, and we hope it doesn’t happen,” Hall said.
St. Mary’s public schools’ special education department this year received $3.4 million from the federal government that is passed through the state.
That money is used primarily to pay for about 54 employees, including special education teachers and paraeducators, Melissa Charbonnet, executive director of special education and student services, said.
An 8 percent cut based on current funding could mean losing as many as five special education teachers or 10 paraeducators in St. Mary’s schools, she said.
Southern Maryland Tri-County Community Action Committee, a nonprofit agency that is funded through federal, state and local funding, oversees Head Start programs in St. Mary’s, Calvert and Charles counties.
Eileene Zimmer, child and family services director for the local Head Start agency, said she has received no direction from the national headquarters to prepare for cuts. But if that direction comes, she will be ready.
The tri-county group operates on a budget of $4.4 million from the federal government. An 8 percent cut would mean Zimmer would need to shave about $354,000 from the local agency’s budget.
The agency currently serves about 600 children ages 3 and 4, including 200 children and their families in St. Mary’s County at four locations.
She expects that if the cuts do go into effect she will receive guidance on reworking the local budget. She said the national office could chose to absorb some of the cuts and also could prohibit local offices from cutting anything that directly impacts children.
Some government officials recently have suggested public school systems partner with existing Head Start organizations to help expand prekindergarten in public schools.
The National Head Start Association is urging people to lobby Congress to spare the organization from cuts related to sequestration.
Head Start services could be eliminated for approximately 70,000 children if sequestration goes through, according to information from the White House released earlier this month. Groups that work with Head Start could have to lay off more than 14,000 teachers and other staff.
Nationally, Title I education funds would be eliminated for more than 2,700 schools that support more than 1 million disadvantaged students across the country, according to the White House.
About 10,000 teacher and aide jobs would be at risk, as well as some after-school programs and other interventions that help close achievement gaps.
Cuts to special education nationally could eliminate federal support to more than 7,200 teachers, aides and other staff that work with students with disabilities.

Interview with Susan M. Schneider, author of the book The Science of Consequences: How They Affect Genes, Change the Brain, and Impact Our World
________________
Mike Carruthers:
Learning can be done in many ways and one great way to learn is from consequences.
Susan M. Schneider:
We know from extensive research that learning from consequences modifies the brain big time.
Susan Schneider author of the book, The Science of Consequences, says we actually learn better from positive consequences rather than negative ones.
Just think of it as for ourselves at work it’s nice to be appreciated for when you work hard and accomplish something. It’s just not a good working environment and it does not conduce to efficiency when all you hear are negatives.
Parents, managers, anyone who gives feedback or consequences to others should be aware of the ratio of positive to negative consequences they give.
You do want it to be fairly positive – there are a lot of benefits from that. Research is in areas ranging from language learning to prison rehabilitation to marriage relations to animal training and all those areas ratios are maybe 3 to 4 to 1 are beneficial – you do want to have it positive.
Despite the proven effectiveness of rewarding and praising positive accomplishments there just isn’t a whole lot of it around.
Few of us give or receive enough praise and I do think that is what the evidence shows. If not to say that praise can be overdone but I think that few of us are fortunate enough to have that problem frankly.

According to George Cumbee of Classic Recording in Franklin Tennessee (), “Everyone knows RADAR has the sound quality, but we needed compatibility too. With so many [RADAR] units in Nashville we needed to handle the [RADAR] format on a daily basis but we also wanted the ability to export to ProTools . for our clients and ourselves. Now we can track on the RADAR 24 and send it over to ProTools . with just a couple of keystrokes. RADAR has done more to increase our business than any purchase of equipment we have ever made in over 25 years. It’s always been a great sounding, reliable recorder and now with 3.10 it’s compatible too.”
iZ Technology’s VP of Marketing, Robin Leboe explains “3.10 is the first stage in making the RADAR 24 plug and play compatible with other systems. We want to remove obstacles from the creative process and do our bit to keep technology out of the way.” Leboe says the company is serious about listening to customers. “A lot of new features in 3.10 are a direct result of requests by RADAR 24 users worldwide.” Robin continues, “The feedback that we’ve received so far is telling us that 3.10 adds substantial value to our product. It saves RADAR 24 owners time and money”.
Other unique features of the new software include:
The new software package is available from dealers or directly from iZ Technology at a cost of $99.00 US per upgrade bundle. The package includes the four 3.10 software diskettes, a print version of the new manual, a key cap removal tool and a package containing the 22 replacement Session Controller key caps.

Frequently Asked Questions about Advising:
Where do I get an advisor? How do I get my advisee folder and records?
Every student is assigned, or chooses, an advisor. Your advisor is noted on the outside of your advisee folder in the department office. The Administrative Coordinator or Student Assistant at the main desk can check your folder out to you and you may take it to your advising session with your faculty advisor. You should review your records before you see your advisor. You may not take your folder off campus or keep it overnight. Return it promptly after your advising session. These records (except for transfer transcripts from another institution) may soon be on line through the SSU Office of Admissions and Records on the SSU Website. You pay a one-time records fee and may request a transcript of your record at any time from the Admissions and Record's Office, 2nd floor, Salazar Hall.
How often do I need to be advised?
You should see your advisor at least once each semester. It is helpful to schedule an appointment before registration to insure that you select courses appropriate to your academic pattern. You should meet with more than once a semester if you are a Freshman or second semester Junior. However, you can meet with any faculty member or your advisor during his/her regular office hours which should be posted on the office door and available in the Department Office. You should arrange your appointment ahead of time and should allow at least 20 minutes. Many faculty members can also be contacted by phone and through their e-mail addresses on campus. Do not bother a faculty member at home unless you have been given specific permission to do so by that faculty member or the Administrative Coordinator.
Before you see your advisor make sure that you have reviewed your courses and know where you stand within the major. Faculty other than your regular advisor are also available to help you with decisions and information regarding career directions or other options within the field. You should make a point of getting to know two or three faculty members during your study at SSU to insure that you get a variety of points of view and have resources for letters of recommendation and employment references.
What will my advisor do?
You should review your records and be familiar with the courses you have already taken before you make your appointment. In addition to our departmental records, you should also keep all grade records, transcripts, and copies of petitions in your own personal folder. If you have unusual courses from another institution, you should keep a course description from that institution in your personal records and provide us with a copy for your advising folder. (Copies of school catalogues are on file in the library if you do not have one.)
Your advisor will review your record of courses and will note your progress toward General Education and toward the major on an advising worksheet which is kept in your folder. You will be given a carbon copy of this worksheet for your own records and should bring it to each advising session so that it can be updated. Your advisor will determine which of your courses meets our requirements based on an "Articulation Agreement Summary." If no articulation agreement exists with your prior college or university, you will need to provide a catalogue description of the course, a course syllabus, or some other official description of the work you have done. A written record of your advisor's decisions will be made on your worksheet.
What about G.E.?
You will receive an evaluation of any prior college-level work in the mail. At the bottom of this evaluation is the name of a transcript evaluator in Admissions and Records. This evaluator will be responsible for your file during the course of your education. You should be sure you have purchased a college catalogue for the year indicated as your "catalogue year" in your admission letter and indicated on your SSU transcript evaluation. For First Time Freshmen your catalogue year is the year that you enter SSU. (This year will apply provided you do not interrupt your college studies for more than one semester at any time.)
How do I get credit for work I have done that isn't on my G.E. evaluation?
If you think this evaluator has made an error or omitted a course you should first consult your departmental advisor and if s/he agrees, then the evaluator noted on your records. If you still feel that you should receive credit for work not included on your transcript evaluation, you will need to provide a course description from that school (this could be a description from the college catalogue or a course description). Then you may need to complete a Substitution of GE Class Form petition (available in the Department Office or from Admission and Records). This form should be carefully filled out and signed by your advisor and by the Chair of the department which normally offers the course at SSU which is most equivalent to the one you took at another institution. The Associate Vice President of Academic Programs is the final level of review and approval. Your departmental advisor should be able to help you with charting your course through this petition process as well as the rest of your General Education. The Office of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management (Salazar Hall 1018; 664-2839) has help available if you do not get the answers you want in the department. Joyce Chong is the Director of the Advising Center in Salazar Hall 1070 and several student assistants are also knowledgeable and will help you. There are now new options for first time freshmen (students who have completed less than 4 of their G.E. courses) including an individualized G.E. option for 50 first time freshmen.
How to choose a G.E. course?
As you attempt to determine which G.E. courses you should take, keep in mind: Which courses are you most interested in? Are there choices that would be useful to your emphasis within the department? Is there something you have always wanted to know about or for which you have a passionate interest? How can you be most efficient (e.g. which courses fulfill one or more G.E. or major requirements simultaneously)? The lower division Art History Survey courses fulfill the G.E. C-1 category, while the department Modern Art History Requirement can also fulfill 3 of the Upper Division G.E. units (C-1) if you take ArtH 464: 19th Century; ArtH 465, Modern Art 1945-79; ArtH 455: 20th Century; or ArtH 460: American Art. There are courses outside the department which have been designed for the humanities/art student, such as Math 111: Symmetry in the Sciences and Arts(3); CALS 220: Mexican American Arts and Literature (3), CALS 393: Chicano/Latino Cinema (3); or NAMS 205: Introduction to Native American Arts(3), NAMS 338: Native Americans and the Cinema (3), NAMS 430: Advanced Native American Workshop and a number of other courses in History, Gender Studies, etc.
Entry Level Math and English Requirements
You may confer with your advisor regarding the Entry Level Math (ELM), English Placement (EPT) and Written English Proficiency (WEPT) examinations and your standing relative to those requirements. You will receive scores for the ELM and EPT placement exams that will determine which English and Math courses you are required to take. Some students may be exempt from these tests or will find specific classes noted for them, depending upon their SAT, ACT and advanced placement test scores. "Sequence sheets" for G.E. Math and English courses will guide you and your advisor through the courses you need to complete the requirements.
What about the Major?
Your advisor will review your courses in art and will note the categories they fill on your advising worksheet in your folder. As these courses and categories are complete you will be able to mark your progress through the major. Your advisor will note the course name, course number, and units of credit on this advising worksheet. You have the option of applying the requirements in place for the year in which you started your college education (provided you have not had more than a one semester break in attendance) or the year in which you graduate. If special circumstances arise you should discuss these with your advisor and the Registrar.
Credit for art courses you have taken at another institution not offered at SSU
You may still feel that you have fulfilled a requirement. There are several ways to approach consideration for credit. For example, at the lower division studio majors are required to take 6 units of studio courses from three different areas: painting, sculpture, photography or printmaking. You may have taken a weaving or a jewelry class at a junior college. Your advisor and you may discuss what was covered in the course and/or you may be asked to provide a course description from your junior college catalogue. Together you can determine whether the course fulfills this particular lower division requirement. In cases where you have had extensive work outside the classroom or at an unaccredited institution you have the option of "challenging " a course.
Procedure for challenging an art course
You should enroll in the course you are attempting to challenge and make sure to meet the deadline for dropping off slides or a portfolio to challenge that course. One day early in each semester (before the add/drop deadline) is set aside for studio course challenges. The date will be posted throughout the department. You will present a portfolio or slides of your work to several of the studio faculty, including someone from the area in which you have done your work. They will determine whether or not you have acquired the skills and knowledge included in the course you are challenging. If you are successful, you will receive credit for the course on your transcript and you should drop the course to allow space in the class for someone else. (The department will accept a "CR" grade for challenged courses only so you do not have to stay enrolled in the course in order to get a grade.) If you do not pass the challenge, you may continue as a regular student enrolled in the class.
Art History students should consult the teachers responsible for the courses they wish to challenge. After consulting with you to determine if you have adequate background and experience, those instructors will arrange for you to take an examination in order to receive credit.
Department policy stipulates that you may challenge two lower division and one upper division class in the major. Please check with the Department Office for forms and information regarding challenge procedures.
What if I took a lower division course at another institution--can it count toward an upper division requirement?
Generally, no. Sometimes students will take "Advanced Painting" or "Modern Art History" at a community college. Even though the titles seem to be the same as our upper division classes, you do not receive upper division credit. Upper division courses are those at the 300 and 400 level. Community college courses are at the 100 and 200 level. If you feel that you have acquired the skills and knowledge of the upper division course you should speak to your advisor about the challenge procedure.
What is the difference between "foundation courses ", "core courses", and "electives"?
Foundation courses are the building blocks for the major. You take these courses before or simultaneously with beginning courses in your major. A core course is required of all students for the emphasis in the major. After the core requirements are complete, there is some latitude for students to take courses in related areas for breadth. Each program outlines these different requirements in the catalogue.
B.F.A. Program
In addition to a 45 unit B.A. in Art Studio (with emphases in Painting, Drawing, Sculpture, Printmaking and Photography), the department offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts Program (with emphases in Painting, Photography, Printmaking and Sculpture), for a select and limited number of Art Studio Majors. This is a degree designed for students wishing to pursue additional graduate or professional study. Students interested in this 132 unit program with 70 units of course work in art, must apply for admission to this special program. Forms are available in the Department Office and the application process for the year begins early each Spring Semester for admission into the following Fall Semester's program. You will only be considered for admission after you have completed all lower division requirements in both General Education and in Art. You will only be eligible for admission to the BFA if you have achieved a 3.00 G.P.A. in Art. You must maintain this 3.0 G.P.A. as you progress through the program. You will be asked to supply 20 slides and 2 letters of recommendation in addition to a short statement describing why the program is of interest to you. After an initial review, students who are initially selected will be interviewed. If you are one of the 6-9 fortunate students selected for admission you will have to insure that 24 of your upper division studio units must be completed at SSU. Your degree will culminate with a B.F.A. exhibition in the Spring which will be evaluated by the studio faculty. Your studio advisor and studio instructors can help you to determine if this is an appropriate direction for you to pursue.
Art History
We now offer a separate B.A. degree in Art History. The Art History Major has undergone some modifications within the last few years. The changes include the requirement of a course in non-western art (at either the lower or upper division level); the grouping of courses into five generalized categories to require chronological breadth; and a Senior Project which will function as a "capstone" experience in conjunction with the ProSeminar in Art History Methods. Students will elect to do either a 1 unit Senior Paper (ArtH 491H) or and Honors Paper (ArtH492) for 2 units (with the consent of the Art History Faculty). Under the revised program Art History majors will take only one course from the Modern Art sequence (although others may be taken as electives toward the 32 upper-division unit total).
Financial Aid, Lockers, the Art Club, Lab Fees and Other Practical Questions
Am I Eligible for Scholarships and Financial Assistance and Where Do I Apply?
The Financial Aid Office is located 1st floor, Salazar Hall, phone (707) 664-2389. Most students who have not applied for financial aid when they apply for admission to the university will want to visit the Financial Aid Office to inquire about deadlines for grants and the various options available to them. Once you have filed a financial aid application you should check regularly if you do not receive word back from them in a timely fashion. Some students will qualify for Work Study funds. Several Work Study positions exist in the Department, providing students with work opportunities in the Gallery, Tool Cribs, Slide Room and Art Office which relate to their major. In addition, there are many scholarship possibilities for Art Students including several departmental scholarships. (The Les and Alexis Brooks Scholarship; the Boyle Scholarship for Study Abroad; the Art Department Scholarship and others). The deadline for applying for academic scholarships occurs early in each Spring Semester. You will need 3 letters of reference from faculty familiar with your work. You will also be asked to write an essay describing why you want a scholarship, what you have accomplished, and your goals after college.

Glad to see E the the day off. He needs a rest.
Beard Mode back, Belly 2.0 in, should more than cancel out Loretta.
Should the fact that we have no clever nickname or way to reference Loretta be a clue as to how we value his contributions?

So a man goes to the doctor and says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."
The doctor replies, "Then stop sticking your foot in your mouth, Milton!"
Second that on ethier. There were a couple of balls yesterday that he should have sent into orbit but he looked tired.
Make that 3-nil to the Cubbies. Zito getting roughed up early. Braves bearing down on Hated Ones!
...the doctor replies, "No shit, now get off my foot!"
Thank you!
I'm here all week. Try the veal!
Can we just get this one win done? I'm dying over here!
... Replies "win a fricken game so that you can clinch this. Sheesh it is the pirates for Christ's sake!!!"
Mr. C-
We tried the Veal yesterday!
Nice. 1 vote for AC.
@db
Just don't have the salmon mousse.
RB-
Did you make it back from softball last night? Hope the beer is cold and the burgers are on by game time.
Chelsea- shocked.
Razorbacks- being humiliated
I'm needing some serious sports mojo at this point.
The doctor replies, "You've been saying that for the last three years, Mr. Schmidt. I think it's time you quit."
Isn't it a little much to call them the "undefeated Falcons" when it's been only two weeks of football?
Right, MLASF. It's like that a pitcher "carrying a perfect game to the 2nd inning."
^ forget the "that"
Has the baseball started yet?
I hope the Dodgers remember they have to face the mediocre Pirates pitching tonight.
Guy walks into a doctor's office and says, "Hey doc, it hurts when I do this."
Doctor says, "I'm a gynecologist."
What up, peeps?
Was a baserunning blunder by Furcal or a good throw?
DB,
Sorry to hear about Chelsea's day.
Well, not really, but Arsenal was only slightly better. One win away from the top 4.
@DB,
Not only did I make it back, we won; I went 4-4 with 3 runs scored, and I ran for my buddy with bad knees.
It was like going to the gym, only harder. Lots of beer at the pizza place, now I'm comfortably into Bud #2 watching the Blue.
Don't be starting in on me now, RB!
Was that a tremendous play by Wolf to get the out at first our what??? I'm awake now.
FB, you looking forward to that Foreigner show?
Who do you think you are, Furcal, RB? (September Furcal, I mean.)
Jints go down 6-2. Go start the truck!
I've got to get to Pittsburgh for a game. They just had a steamboat go past the centerfield wall. That, and I like to be alone.
PNC seems like a good place for solitude.
DB,
I felt like September Furcal during the game, and August Furcal when I woke up this morning.
A listener could have even heard the steamboat take a toot off the air horn it was so quiet in the park.
Actually it has always looked like a lovely ballpark that I would love to go visit sometime. Of course, I can't really tell because it's in super blur-o-vision today - no HD.
Just checking ticket prices at PNC. Seats right behind the Dodger dugout go for about 20 bucks. Even with airfare, that's cheaper than Dodger Stadium with parking.
Rbnlaw, how was your daughter's volleyball game?
Isn't Pierre due for his annual HR?
DB,
I've got the game in HD on PT. Is your cable working?
I've yet to meet the man who drinks Tecate light.
Thankfully.
@karina,
The Saints of Saint Anthony HS were victorious, defeating the Saints of Crean Lutheran South HS 3 games to 0.
Daughter started in the second game and got 5 kills to begin the game.
Thanks for asking.
Martin with the CANNON!
Cable working, RB. Charter must not have picked up Dodgers today. I cannot for the life of me figure out what their broadcast package is or isn't.
RB, and with LA traffic, it's probably easier to fly all the way to Pitt than it is to get to Chavez Ravine.
Belli2 with the Web Gem!
Oh, Belly#2, what would we be doing without you?
DB,
Especially when you come from OC like me.
I'm checking the schedule now.
@Rbnlaw Awesome!
Saint Anthony? as in Saint Anthony of Padua?
Crap. We open the season vs. the Buckies.
Can't go.
Maybe Cincy?
@karina,
That's the Saint. As in San Antonio.
Oooh, 2010 calendar time. Is it downloadable yet?
Anyone ever been to Nats' yard? It's a beautiful park with a lot of character. I work in DC frequently so have gone a number of times. Apr 23-25.
Was that...Loretta?!
No, couldn't have been Loretta. Must've been Blake in disguise.
Alright wolfie, make them pay for that.
3-0 going to bottom of 4th. I like this so far.
ah, well...
Early season Loretta!
The funny thing is, Mr. C, true to form, I was typing almost that same thing you just said then had a bad keystroke that erased it all. So when I refreshed, you had said it.
Rain coming back. Hurry up and get this one in, lads!
Bills, that's the way to give up a long ball, when it's early and no one else is on base. Just get it out of the way like that.
@db
Clearly, our brains must be damaged in similar ways;)
(Forgot my wolfie suit, too. Hopefully no bad juju.)
@ Mr. C
And the weird thing is I was going to refer to him as "Wolfie" though I honestly can't remember ever in the past calling him that.
Yeah, similar drain bamage.
Let's see : if we get early season Loretta-Bills, September Furcal and 2007 Russell Martin, we could be unstoppable!
Raffy! Beautiful defence! Loving this infield.
@ Ka(t)rina-
Can we get July 2003 Manny?
Per ESPN, "Sources say Rays interested in Milton Bradley."
Boy, that franchise is going downhill quickly if this is part of their strategic vision.
Fuck off McCutcheon, you scrawny little shitbag! Let it drop!
@Rbnlaw i pray to that Saint every day of my life and my whole family is very devoted to him.
Nice article from Dodgers website re" pitching prospects in postseason. Gives some Torre decision making insight.
@Dusty Baker i don't know, it's up to Manny, but it really is a very nice thought.
just started watching the game. What happened to Eric Collins?
@db
If you click through the link, Joe Maddon just lost one of the Js his travel scrabble set.
(sorry, old gag but still can't resist)
Nic-
HOLY SHIT! I hadn't even noticed! Don't know what that says re Collins.
i think the only reason i knew was because i was listening to the radio and it was Rick Monday solo.
Actually Rick Monday solo would be the best alternative, if Vin is not in the equation (eg East Coast swing).
Wait, I'm confused. What the hell is going on with the announcing staff?
Excellent avatar, MLASF.
The only way the Pirates can get fans to come is with fireworks and some band I've never heard of.
hopefully they benched Eric Collins, i blame every east coast loss on him.
Jeez, it's already the bottom of 6th. Quick game. I need to pick up my beer drinking speed.
Yeah, Collins has been pressing...he needs a few days off to rest and think about it.
"The only way the Pirates can get fans to come is with fireworks and some band I've never heard of."
Just replace the band with some crappy salsa dish and you could be talking about the angels.
If there would ever be a bright spot to Vinny retiring, it would be the stability brought to the announcing team. Right now, for the east coast games, we're using a guy mostly known for dropping his pants and Steve Lyons.
everytime i watch a stupid softball game or little league world series game on ESPN and hear Collins i hang my head in shame.
Totally hear you, Nic.
But I have to ask, how much softball on ESPN are you watching?
I'm pretty sure Collins is doing college football for FSN.
@karina,
Since I'm not Catholic, you need to fill me in on the significance of St. Anthony of Padua.
DB,
You misspelled "defense," and thus gave you up as a Brit. Or a Canadian posing as a Brit.
My grandmother was from Newcastle and Grandfather from Glasgow. Hence, I'm also a Rangers supporter, but can do without the Toon.
haha DB, it was mainly during the college softball world series.
I swear, uhhhh, LOOK OVER THERE!!!!
(runs)
@Rbnlaw - I would suggest we hang him, but since he complimented my avi, I shall allow him to live.
I believe you, Nic. I sure do... *rolls eyes*
re: "defence"
Haw! I didn't even notice that. I read way too many UK publications and many of my close friends are Brits, so I guess it has accidentally sunk in. But no, for better or worse, I'm a red-blooded Amurrican born and raised in Arkansas (more embarrassing to admit given Hogs performance on national TV today).
@rbnlaw
"...gave you up as a Brit..."
Don't let that colour your judgment of him.
thats not a good way to start off the inning.
"Easy play for Manny." -Steiner
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Great game, RDub! HCK to the rescue.
quick nobody mention anything about the pen being good.
Speaking of, where's HLACK? Haven't heard much from him in awhile.
@Dusty - If you are a fan of Arkansas, how good is Mustain? Does he deserve to be at least #2 on the depth chart at SC?
DAMN YOU CHARLIE!!!
Steiner: You know, Julius Caesar has never been stabbed once in his life? Oh wait, hang on, he's being stabbed 23 times!
Argh, almost a line 'em out - throw 'em out DP
Mustain is a bad apple. I think he should be #3 on depth chart. He is a stage-managed (through his dad) pouty little snot. He certainly has athletic potential, but his opportunities for success are dwindling at this point. Given Carroll's system for competition at every spot, clearly Mustain hasn't proven himself. Which, again, I think speaks mainly to his mental state and lack of preparedness and guts.
Well, that certainly is different from what Mychal Thompson has said. Thank you for the info, Dusty.
100
MLASF-
Also looks at the other Hogs transfer now on USC, D. Williams. He has risen to the top at his position, and has shown that doing so was possible given hard work combined with talent. Mustain has taken the opposite path.
It's like an epileptic quail hunt out there.
Funny, Mustain could've been the starter at UCLA for three years.
@Rbnlaw he came from an aristocratic family but decided to turn himself into a Franciscan Friar. Performed on a number of miracles, like the day he multiplied bread, just like Jesus. His day is on June 13th, when Mass is celebrated. That day holy bread is distributed among devotees. In some places in my country, there are parades and fairs held on his honor.
He's the Saint of lost things and impossibles and a sort of "matchmaking Saint for single ladies" for some people, there's a strong tradition to that. For example, most of my family travel to some small town to honor him, but i'm not allowed to go because i'm single and there's a weird superstition single ladies can't go there because they remain unmarried (which is very funny because i decided i'm not getting married).
Bread is sanctified and you eat it when you feel the need to be closer to God or meditate.
Mr. C- It's like Tim Howard pitching.
What the hell?
kuo is struggling out there.
Dammit, Kuo. If you can't get the guy batting exactly Mendoza, you should not be pitching.
Jesus jumped up christ, what is wrong, Kuo?
What the HELL?
Not directed at you, karina.
yikes
is this going to be another game of crap play? Seriously this is going to be the 4th game in a row where we have played like we dont care.
Rox down 3-0 in the third
@karina,
Very interesting about San Antonio. Being the patron saint of lost things kind of explains my daughter's HS. Lots of "lost souls" hanging around.
I'm going to turn myself into a Franciscan Friar if we can't beat these jackasses.
Does Wolf look like he wants to hit Kuo?
Flat Brim Reaper
clap clap, clapclap
Flat Brim Reaper
clap clap clapclap
"Does Wolf look like he wants to hit Kuo?"
it looks like he wants to slice his hand off with a lightsaber.
I can see Wolf and Kuo sitting there trading punches to the shoulder like 5 year olds in the back seat of a station wagon on a family trip.
Bullshit! That was a strike.
GET A FUCKING OUT
@Karina "which is very funny because i decided i'm not getting married"
That sound you hear is many hearts breaking at once.
Well this is a nice little tune up game for the playoffs.
Ball 3 was strike 3
[covers eyes]
Get this scrawny bastard out!
This all goes back to Steiner.
This
is
ri
god
damn
diculous
Mr C-
Are you covering your eyes like Karina in AC before she went in for the kill?
It does, it goes back to Steiner. It's all on his fat ass and fashion forward, age inappropriate glasses.
damn, why do we load the bases for their best hitter?
Steiner: The Hindenburg has never collapsed in its history of flight...wait, it's collapsing right now! Oh, the humanity!
Mr. C,
Quick, back to the cavalier.
F
THIS
NOISE.
This is a bunch of shit.
GOD FUCKING DAMMIT TO HELL FUCKING ASS SHIT DAMMIT TO HELL CRAP IN A BUCK RI-GODDAMN-DICULOUS
this is a great time for our bullpen to start breaking down.
You have to be kidding me. Honestly, folks, of all the playoff teams, we look the least of them the way we're playing. Good thing we're finishing against Nats, Pirates, Padres, etc., right? What if we were playing Braves or Marlins?
There was really no reason to take Wolf out.
Steiner: No president has ever been assassinated in Ford Theater...wait, John Wilksbooth has just killed Lincoln! There goes the Ford Theater's perfect record of living presidents!
why have we only scored three runs!?! this is ridiculous.
@rbnlaw
were it that easy...
If we were playing the Braves and Marlins, we'd probably be doing alot better than this. Everything was fine when we were playing the Giants and Rockies.
Manny walks! Now the comefrombehind begins!
promising...
Lakeritis strikes again.
Time for some Bison No. 27
Bison Mode: Engage
what the hell was kemp waiting for?!
Oh, c'mon Kemp, at least lift the pine off the shoulders
Belly 2.0! We can rebuild him!
lets go road loney!!
I will never use the phrase "Bison Mode: Engage" again as it always brings bad luck. I'm not sure I've ever typed it and it led to success.
Call me Steiner.
Lets show Mr. 8.10 ERA something he's seen many times this season.
Steiner: James Dean has never died in a car accident in his life an - wait, James Dean has just been killed in a head-on collision! The first time Dean has died in a car accident ever!
I have a million of them, I can keep going.
Mr. C-
Ahhhh, all is right with the world now that your avatar is back in place.
Come on, Road-Lo!
that was NOT a strike.
on the bright side the brew crew tied it up 5-5
Brewaz tied with Phiwwy.
Is it possible to clinch the division berth before the generic postseason berth? Because we're on pace for that.
and we load the bases for....
Oh, him.
Bases loaded for JMart. Or whomever will be hitting.
Rancho we should be beating fuck out of these ass clowns!
Cards and Rox tied at 3 now.
Ethier: It's the bottom of the 9th.
Andre in.
?
make him pay for that one andre.
Guess LaRoche is still on our payroll.
That was close
STOP POPPING IT UP, ANDRE
"12:00 - Donner going-away party"
Nice.
ill take a sac fly right here
or a walked in run
oh sweet, sweet walked in runs!!
My arsehole is a little less clenched now.
Release the hound
c'mon O Dog!!!
Come on, O. Talk the ball into the outfield stands.
E, I want to be like you when I grow up.
Rancho do you really want to be here next year, O!
wow, did the fans really think that was a strike?
Sammy is flowing nicely now...I was afraid the game would be over and I would only be into 2 1/2 beers.
@Nic - You would think they'd be used to things not going their way.
damn, should of let it hit him.
Mr. C-
Clearly your avatar mojo is back.
the Pirates are issuing more walks than an AIDS charity.
At least we weren't the only ones to misplace the strike zone!
The O-Dog is loose(ish)!
"Obviously it has not been a very good team." Lyons re Pie Rats.
@db
If it works, who am I to question it?
Almost, Thome. Man, he's due.
damn Charlie and his excitable voice.
THOME TIME!
that what thome does? Hit singles?
THOME!!!! CLutch!

S+V: Let’s talk about some of your vocal choices. How about “Mood Indigo” — that almost doesn’t sound like you singing on it. You used some kind of echo there, right?
Jackson: Yes, that was something I wanted right from the start. I was going for a rockabilly ballad effect. I’m a big fan of Gene Vincent. If you listen to some of his solo tracks that aren’t so well known — ballads like “Up a Lazy River” and “Peg o’ My Heart,” where he used that same kind of rockabilly echo — that was kind of the color I was going for. Sometimes for me, the echo effect is part of the arrangement. I hear that in my head the same as I do the instruments.
First I thought about singing this song in a particular key. I could just hit the falsetto on certain notes, and then it sort of gradually took shape. Elliot doesn’t like to use obvious effects, which I think is a good thing. But sometimes I wanted the echo there as a particular color.
S+V: Your body of work is known for having a great dynamic range — it’s sonically clear and very open.
Jackson: Thank you, yeah. It’s all about the arrangements. Well, it’s not all about them, but the arrangements should be heard clearly. It amazes me how few bands playing live have any dynamics at all. It tends to be everyone playing flat-out all the time.
S+V: In “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing),” you sing these lines: “It ain’t the melody / It ain’t the music / There’s something else that makes the tune complete.” Do you believe that idea yourself — that rhythm is more important than melody?
Jackson: Well, I didn’t write it. [both laugh] I don’t believe there’s one element of music that’s more important than another, actually. Although if you tie me down and tortured me, I’d probably say rhythm is more important than melody. I don’t see any reason in the world why you can’t have both. I mean, I like to draw on everything that’s available.
S+V: Arrangements are so critical in your work. How early in your career did you feel you needed to arrange the material as opposed to just playing it or vamping it?
Jackson: I think right from the beginning. It was always part of the process for me. To be honest, I never really understood the idea where you would write a song and then after having written it, start scratching your head and go, “Well, how am I going to arrange this?” When I’m working on something, I’m hearing in my head what instrument or combination of instruments are going to be making that sound. It seems quite clear to me.
S+V: Does it have to do with your training, that structure of learning the violin and then the piano when you were younger?
Jackson: It probably has something to do with it, yeah. But there’s probably something about me that drew me to being that way — to being open to things, listening to them, and understanding how they’re played and how the effects are done. I just have those kind of ears. I don’t know how else to put it. It’s always been an interest of mine.
To me, the techniques involved in recording and mixing are just an extension of the arranging. They’re there to serve the arrangement. Certain effects of studio techniques can be part of the arrangement as well.
S+V: Are there any particular examples from The Duke you can cite to illustrate that philosophy?
Jackson: “It Don’t Mean a Thing,” particularly when it comes to Stefan [Kruger], the drummer. He does something that sounds like swing but isn’t swing, actually — it’s some kind of mixture of swing and some- thing more contemporary that has a four-to-the-floor bass drum underneath it that’s not that loud in the mix. It has a lot of layers to it, including samples of Papa Jo Jones, the old swing drummer, mixed in with things that were programmed and things that were played by Stefan live in the studio. That’s a case where the arranging and the studio process were all part of the same thing, really.
S+V: How did you decide the album’s running order?
Jackson: It’s a more intuitive process than it is pre-conceived. Putting “Isfahan” first was very deliberate. Once [guitarist] Steve Vai got involved, it took shape, and I thought, “Yeah, this should open the album,” because it’s unexpected in a way, and it’s the least familiar track to most people. It functions as an overture that sets the stage to make you prick up your ears and listen. And then you get to “Caravan.” I thought about “Caravan” being the first track, but I like it being the main course with an appetizer coming first. [laughs] Those two tracks are like taking a journey.
S+V: Duke Ellington kept playing right until he died in 1974, at age 75. Do you see yourself following a similar tract?
Jackson: [laughs] I don’t have a better idea. Well, why not? Who knows what will happen?

It's getting tougher and tougher these days to cheerlead the cause of music in surround sound. No, we at S&V aren't giving up. But, coming so soon after hearing that we're getting the best of Led Zeppelin on stereo CD (again) as opposed to any of the studio albums in 5.1, we can only give a huge sigh at some recent announcements from titans of three different music generations.
First, there's the news that EMI is packaging the entire Pink Floyd studio catalog — from 1967's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn through 1994's The Division Bell — in a CD boxed set called Oh By the Way (shown above), to be released on December 11. Each of the albums is in a mini-LP-style jacket, complete with original dust sleeve and any inserts (posters, stickers, etc.). A 20" x 30" fabric poster is also included, and the box itself is designed by Storm Thorgerson. Any multichannel mixes? Nope! This despite the fact that, when I spoke with James Guthrie on the occasion of The Dark Side of the Moon being released on surround SACD, he was hoping to get the green light to start mixing the studio catalog.
Similarly, Parlophone/EMI is boxing up its Radiohead CDs — from 1993's Pablo Honey to 2003's Hail to the Thief plus 2001's I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings — in a set simply called Radiohead, available December 10. (No word if Capitol is releasing a U.S. version, but you can preorder the box via the band's Web-site store.) Any multichannel mixes? Nope!
Well, in both cases, I guess we shouldn't have expected any. After all, EMI was always the weakest link in the surround-sound chain. And these two boxed sets are clearly being put together (quickly) as Christmas presents, not sonic statements.
Anyway, who needs state-of-the-art surround sound when you can, instead, release a band's catalog on a USB stick? That's right! If you don't want the Radiohead CD boxed set, you can get the Radiohead Limited Edition USB Stick, shaped like the band's bear icon, also available December 10 (via the Web site exclusively).
Says Miles Leonard, managing director of Parlophone: "We are particularly excited about the USB stick, which gives fans an easy and portable way to carry the boxed set and provides another way of bridging the world between online and offline content." Yeah, that's how people want their music these days: easy and portable. Will EMI bother with the Beatles in surround? Maybe we should fuhgedaboudit. Instead, maybe we should expect The Beatles USB Stick, shaped like an apple!
But our third example is, really, inexcusable. I'm speaking of Island's fresh remaster of U2's 1987 album The Joshua Tree, coming November 20. How would you like to buy it?
(1) Standard CD with new Bill Flanagan liner notes and unseen Anton Corbijn photos? Check!
(2) Deluxe Edition CD set with a second disc of B-sides and demos? Check!
(3) Limited Edition Super Deluxe boxed set with the two CDs plus a live DVD of the Joshua Tree tour from the Hippodrome in Paris? Check!
(4) Vinyl set (coming December 4) on two 180-gram audiophile LPs? Check!
(5) The entire album in audiophile surround sound? OF COURSE NOT!
Considering that the band and its parent label, Universal, are going to the trouble of doing a remaster, offering a DVD, and even offering vinyl, it's amazing that no one thought to bother with a surround mix for an album that's crying out for a surround mix. Especially since this is Universal, a onetime cheerleader of multichannel mixes on SACD. But alas, now that Universal's surround guru Paul Bishow is gone, and what with the Steely Dan and Elton John albums still lingering in limbo, what should we expect? Nothing.
The Joshua Tree. OK Computer. Wish You Were Here. Not to mention the entire catalogs for Pink Floyd and Radiohead. All wonderful opportunities for music in surround. All missed. —Ken Richardson

Tim Ingold Pinellas County Sheriff Campaign Kick-off Event
Tim Ingold, Republican for Pinellas County Sheriff, held his Campaign Kick Off Thursday, August 25, 2011 at the St. Petersburg Clearwater Marriott in St. Petersburg, Florida. Soundwave Productions sent our political event team, Campaign Event Production, out to set up some blue drape, flags, and some lighting for the event.
Rick Perry Press Events in South Carolina
Texas Governor, Rick Perry had a series of personal and press events this past weekend in South Carolina and Soundwave was called in to help!
“We’ve had such a great relationship with several political campaigns, that it seems second nature for Soundwave to be called in for an event!”
- John Donahue, Event Producer and New Media Manager
We had several breakout rooms and a main room to provide sound, lighting, and drape for. It’s always fun and exciting to be a part of a campaign, but a Presidential campaign adds another level of excitement to our job!
Florida Governor Rick Scott was recently in a classroom in St. Petersburg, FL signing an education bill helping charter schools and aiding parents with school choice. And, as always, when the Governor needs sound and lighting support for a press conference and bill signing, Soundwave is ready, willing, and excited to help out!
C-SPAN, Jon Huntsman, and Soundwave Productions
This past Saturday, former Governor Jon Huntsman (R-UT) spoke at the Republican Party of Sarasota County Presidential Contender Series rally held at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Sarasota, Florida. C-SPAN was there and here is the video…
Governor Signs Pill Mill Bill
Florida Governor, Rick Scott, signed the Pill Mill Bill into law today at Hillsborough County Jail surrounded by several Hillsborough County Sheriffs, local dignitaries, members of the media, and of course, Soundwave Productions was there!
It’s always a pleasure to help the Governor with an event, but lately these events have been more special because Soundwave has been a part of several historical bill signings.
“It’s really an honor to be a part of history WHILE it’s being made!”
- John Donahue, Event Producer and New Media Director
We are very grateful that Governor Scott has been keeping the promises he made during the campaign, and Soundwave is proud to be a part of Governor Scott’s success!
Press Conference – Goya Foods
Goya Foods is celebrating their 75th anniversary and wanted to hold a press conference to announce some of their plans for commemorating this achievement! They rented some space in the parking lot of the Meadowlands Sports Complex in Rutherford, NJ.
Soundwave was asked to come and install some needed stage and press risers to facilitate the press conference.
As a visual reminder, they pulled 18 wheeler trailers up to surround the tent where the press conference was being held.
One of the best parts of this trip was to be able to see the New York City skyline just over the river from the sports complex.

Tree-hugger Rau, also known as Kate the Great, is a Johannesburg-based writer by trade and a global traveller by choice.
She has lived in cities, on an island and in a beach house, but she tends to think of the African bush as her home. She's a keen wildlife photographer, an amateur birder, a lover of words and song and a bit of an adventurer. She's not very good at choosing the right shoes to wear on long walks, hikes or treks through the bush.
What one wish does she hope to be granted? "Long life," she says. "So I'll be able to see all the things I want to before I close my eyes."

I’ve never seen the Bears play a first quarter like that.
Heck, no one has ever seen a first quarter like the one the Bears laid on the Titans.
For the first time in their long, glorious history, the Bears rang up 28 points before they had played 15 minutes. They got touchdowns from the defense and special teams, and two from the offense, one on the ground, the other in the air.
The Bears scored for the cycle.
If you’ve ever dreamed of seeing the Bears return to the total dominance you remember from 1985, this was it. Real, not imagined, and about as efficiently as you could want.
They blocked a punt for a touchdown. They returned an interception for another pick-6. They used a Devin Hester punt return to score from the Titans’ 8 on one play. They needed two plays for Jay Cutler to hit Brandon Marshall in the end zone after one of their three fumble recoveries.
Brian Urlacher forced a fumble, recovered a fumble and returned an interception for a touchdown in less than 20 minutes. Looks like another Bear who’ll be named Defensive Player of the Week. Heck, defensive player of the half.
Charles Tillman forced two fumbles in the first quarter, while Chris Conte forced a fumble and recovered another. Late in the first half, they fought for a pass in the end zone that one of them should’ve intercepted. But how do you argue with such great defense in the end zone?
Great defense all over, actually, because back when the game was still in question, the Bears stopped the Titans on third-and-1 and third-and-2.
The Bears were so good in the first half that they even completed a screen pass. In fact, Matt Forte’s 47-yard reception that took him from the right side of the field in Bears territory to the left side in Titans territory marked the Bears’ longest pass play this season.
Titans fans would’ve been booing ferociously if Bears fans hadn’t taken over the stadium the way Bears players took over the game.
Of course, there were some wonky sights. Cutler began another game throwing high, wild and wobbly. The Bears failed to get points out of a drive that started in Titans territory. Cutler fumbled on a sack again.
Most troubling, however, is the offense’s failure on consecutive first-and-goal possessions in the third quarter.
On the first drive, Michael Bush gained four yards on two plays, and a third-down pass went nowhere.
On the second attempt, the longest gain was a catch of a deflected pass by right guard Lance Louis.
Is this any way to run an offense?
The massive 31-5 halftime lead should’ve allowed the Bears to practice whatever they wanted. The problem is, they might’ve tried to do exactly that.
Cutler was able to move the offense on those possessions. The Bears did get inside the 10, after all. And later, Cutler lofted a beautiful rainbow to Marshall for a 39-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter to make it a ridiculous 44-12.
But the offense’s inability to pay off great situations such as first-and-goal presents an issue. It might prove acutely painful in the final seven games against opponents who ranked in the top 13 in defense heading into Sunday’s games.
Then, look at that: The Bears might’ve learned something about tight and unforgiving situations.
After Tillman forced his fourth fumble --- no lie, his fourth, incredible --- the Bears started first-and-goal at the 2, and Cutler eventually hit Marshall for a score. It didn’t make everything all better, but it counts as improvement.
That’s the type of day it was, one the Bears started and ended with an quick and explosive fury that no one had ever seen.

Faculty Meeting Minutes
February 28, 2012
FACULTY MEETING MINUTES, February 28, 2012, Olin 105
Approved
The meeting was called to order at 11:30 by President Schrum.
The minutes of the January 24, 2012, faculty meeting were approved on a voice vote.
The list of candidates for May graduation was approved on a voice vote.
Reports
University Council. Jim Hunt reported that there was no business for the faculty to consider but that the council was becoming more proactive.
Academic Affairs Council. Suzanne Buchele moved, on behalf of the council, that the final draft of the QEP proposal be adopted. In the ensuing discussion several questions were raised and answered: Can clusters include courses that have just a module with cluster-related material? (Yes, the purpose of the cluster system to stimulate conversation.) Will there be a formal process for approving courses for clusters? (Yes, but we will wait to include any “recommendations” from SACS to set up the final process and it will remain under AAC supervision.) Is the cluster paradigm widespread among colleges? (No; ours is unusual although not unique.)
The proposal was approved by secret ballot, 76 for and 6 against, with 3 abstentions.
Faculty Affairs Council. Brian Neighbors moved adoption of a revised Statement on Religious Diversity. The proposal was approved by voice vote. Text of the Statement is included as attachment A. Dr. Neighbors also reported that the council was continuing its work on the Faculty Evaluation Task Force proposal on criteria for promotion to full professor. The council welcomes feedback from faculty in this attempt to systematize the process and eliminate inconsistencies. Issues raised in the discussion included possibly requiring five years at the associate level before eligibility for promotion; defining scholarly achievement, noting among other points that conference presentations are not equivalent to journal publications; the failure to provide a grandfather clause for faculty members hired under the current standards; a possible review process for full professors; better teaching review procedures, including addressing possible gender bias in student evaluations; and mentoring junior faculty in both teaching and research areas.
President’s report. Mary Visser has been named to the Herman Brown Chair. Theresa Sullivan, president of the University of Virginia, will be the 2012 commencement speaker. The Brown Foundation has been asked to grant 3 million dollars for work on the science building. The locker room in the Robertson Center will be named for recently deceased baseball coach Jim Mallon.
Provost’s report. Jim Hunt announced the hiring of two new assistant professors, Valerie Renegar in Communication Studies and Erin Crockett in Psychology. A promised bequest has been made by alumnus Joe Taylor, now 60 years old, of 5 to 15 million dollars, to be directed toward academic purposes. The new football coach (Joe Austin), coming to Southwestern from Hanover College, has arrived and begun work. Planning continues on the institution of a January term next year. This will result in a one-week delay in the start of the second semester.
The meeting was adjourned at 12:21.

Building Community Through Gardening

Southwestern employees trade work in the garden for fresh produce
Even though the students are gone for the summer, Southwestern’s community garden is still bustling with activity.
On a recent Thursday morning, more than 20 people – half of whom were children – could be found in the garden harvesting, weeding, composting and bagging produce for distribution.
It’s all part of a new program started by Molly Jensen, a religion professor who also serves as the faculty advisor for the community garden.
Jensen offered Southwestern faculty and staff members the opportunity to receive a free bag of fresh produce each week in exchange for 10 hours of work in the garden over the summer. The response to her offer was so overwhelming she had to put some people on a waiting list.
“Within 15 minutes of sending out the notice I had 40 people who were interested,” she said.
Jensen held orientation sessions to familiarize all the new volunteers with the garden and the different tasks they can help with – from weeding and watering to planting and picking. It’s all part of a new trend known as Community Supported Agriculture (CSA).
Many of those who signed up said they did so because they wanted their children to learn where their food comes from.
“My daughter had no sense of where her food comes from,” said Kim Murphy, assistant dean for academic success and advising. Murphy was full of enthusiasm as her six-year-old daughter, Norah, found beans to pick in the garden on the first harvest day. She said they planned to make a side dish of the beans to go with a homemade pizza.
Others said they signed up to learn more about gardening from Jensen, who worked at the Sustainable Food Center in Austin before joining the Southwestern faculty.
“I’d like to have a garden at home, but I don’t know anything about gardening,” said Paulette Butterworth, associate director of Advancement Information Services in University Relations. “This has been an incredible learning experience.” Butterworth brought her seven-year-old son, Drew, to help in the garden on the first harvest day. “He had a blast,” she said. “He is already asking to go back.”
On May 31, all those who signed up to participate in the program received their first bag of produce. The bags contained beans, basil, mint, banana peppers and some greens. Jensen was beaming as she handed them out.
“This is a happy day,” she said.
Future harvests from the garden this summer are expected to include tomatoes, squash, corn, okra and lettuce. Jensen is encouraging participants to share recipes that use the produce they are receiving.

More than a year of planning, fundraising and construction came to fruition in February as Southwesterns first Habitat for Humanity house was dedicated.
In all, Southwestern volunteers put more than 930 hours into the project. Several parents visiting campus for Family Days even pitched in by helping landscape the house.
The result is a 1,200-square-foot house for Olga Chairez and her two children, Eduardo and Kimberly. Chairez received keys to the house, along with a ceremonial toolbox, at an official dedication ceremony Feb. 17. Among those attending the ceremony was Congressman John Carter, who praised Georgetown for its commitment to building an entire Habitat for Humanity neighborhood. The Southwestern house is one of 20 planned for the Old Mill Village neighborhood, located on the site of a former cottonseed oil factory.
Sophomore Tyler Deatonone of many students who helped work on the househad the opportunity to meet the Chairez family and experience their gratitude firsthand. The tears Ive seen and the huge smiles on the childrens faces makes me think that this is worth so much more than $50,000 and hundreds of hours of work, he says. Southwestern had to raise $50,000 to sponsor the house.
Leyka Ishibashi, another sophomore who worked on the project, says she was inspired by the Southwestern communitys response to the project. It is nice to see that people dont need to get paid to help someone, she explains. Without the volunteer support, the house could not have been completed.

Quote:Chapter 39 - A High Standard"Is your daughter a college student?" asked the librarian who used to give me the books on Zoya's list.The lists were always long and varied. What did Zoya not read for her paper on the Paris Commune! There were historical works and translations from the French worker poets—Pottier and Clement. She read even more books about the Patriotic War of 1812. Her imagination was fired by Kutuzov and Bagration and the battles they fought, and she would rapturously repeat whole passages from Tolstoy's War and Peace by heart. Preparing for her report on Ilya Muromets, the folklore hero, she made up a long list of rare books, which I sought out with difficulty in various libraries.It was no news to me that Zoya could work seriously, go straight to the very deepest source, to the very heart of the matter, that she could bury herself in her subject. But before Chernyshevsky she had never given herself up to any pursuit so completely and unreservedly. The day she became acquainted with Chernyshevsky was one of the most important in Zoya's life.When she came home from the lesson at which Vera Sergeyevna had told the children about Chernyshevsky's life, Zoya said, "I want to know everything about him, Mummy! And at school we've only got What Is To Be Done? Please find out what they have in your library. I should like to have a big lull biography, and the correspondence and memoirs of his contemporaries. I want to be able to picture to myself what he was like in life."A reticent girl, Zoya suddenly became talkative Apparently she needed to share every thought, ever discovery, every new spark ignited by the things she had read.She would show me an old biography of Chernyshevsky, and say, "Here it says that in his first years as a student he took no interest in anything except study. But take a look at the Latin poetry he gave his cousin ft translate: 'May justice triumph or the world perish!' Or this: 'May falsehood vanish or the heavens fall!' Could that just be by chance…? And here, from a letter to the literary critic A. N. Pypin: 'To work not for transient glory but for the eternal glory of your Fatherland and for the good of mankind—what can be higher and more desirable than this?' Mama, I won't bother you any more but just listen to this. It's a note in his diary: 'I shall gladly give up my life for the triumph of my convictions! For the triumph of freedom, equality, brotherhood and prosperity, for the destruction of poverty and sin! If 1 am convinced that my convictions are just, and that they will triumph, I will not even regret not seeing the day when they shall triumph and rule, and death itself will be sweet, not bitter, be I only convinced of this'…To think of anyone saying after that that he was only interested in study!"Once she began to read What Is To Be Done? Zoya could not tear herself away from the book. She was so absorbed in it that for the first time in her life, I think, she forgot to warm up the dinner at the usual hour. She hardly noticed me come in. For a second she gazed at me with faraway, unseeing eyes, and again bent over the book. Without disturbing her I lighted the kerosene stove, put on the soup, and took the bucket to pour water into the wash basin. It was only then that Zoya stirred, jumped up and grasped the bucket from me with the words, "I'll do it myself!"That night, after supper was over, Shura and I went to bed. When I awoke late at night, Zoya was still reading. I got up, took the book from her in silence and placed it on the shelf. Zoya looked at me guiltily and imploringly."It's difficult for me to sleep with the light, and I must be up early tomorrow," I said, knowing that only this would persuade her.In the morning Shura could not resist teasing his sister. "You know, Mummy, Zoya dived into that book as soon as she came back from school yesterday. And I saw she was lost to the world. I expect she'll soon begin sleeping on nails like Rakhmetov."Zoya said nothing, but in the evening she came home from school with a book quoting Georgi Dimitrov's words about Rakhmetov—how the Russian writer's hero had become a model for the young Bulgarian worker taking his first steps in the revolutionary movement. Dimitrov wrote how in his youth he had striven to become just as firm, strong-willed and seasoned as Rakhmetov, how he had striven to subjugate his own personal life to the great cause—the struggle for the liberation of the toilers."The Life of Chernyshevsky"—was the theme of Zoya's next essay. She read and searched tirelessly for more and more material, and frequently unearthed facts of winch I had no knowledge.Zoya described the civil (i.e., mock) execution of Chernyshevsky with laconic eloquence. The dull wet morning, the scaffold with the black post and chains, and the black board with the white letters "State Criminal," which they hung on Chernyshevsky's neck.Then, the three months of hard exhausting travel, hundreds and thousands of long endless versts. And at last Kadaya—the remote Siberian convict settlement where the tsarist government tried to extinguish "the bright torch of banished science."In one of her books Zoya found an ink drawing or rather a sketch, done by one of the political exiles, of the hut where Chernyshevsky lived. Shura, stirred by Zoya's enthusiasm, copied this sketch into her notebook, and succeeded in conveying the main thing: the despair gripping the cold deserted region. The hard line of the horizon, the marsh, the sandy wastes, a thin dwarfish forest, the crosses on the graves—all this seemed crushed by the low sullen skies; and crushed also by a terrible weight was the little hut itself, behind the walls of which one could expect neither warmth, nor comfort, nor joy.The years dragged on in loneliness…A cheerless dreary life. And the more incredible seemed the letters which Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky wrote to his wife and children, letters full of warmth, light, tenderness and love, which took months to arrive through the night and snow.Thus passed seven long years. What a remarkable letter Chernyshevsky writes on the eve of his release to his wile Olga Sokratovna!"My dear friend, my joy, my only love and thought. I write to you on the anniversary of our wedding. My dear joy, I thank you for bringing light to my life… On the 10th of August I shall cease to be idle and useless to you and the children. By the autumn I think I shall find a place in Irkutsk, or near Irkutsk, and shall be able to work as before… Soon everything will begin to go right…From this autumn…Every word breathes the confidence and hope that they will meet soon. But instead—exile to Vilyuisk, and another thirteen long years of loneliness! The cold severe winter lasting half a year, and all round—marshland and tundra. These are the hardest years of imprisonment, not even lightened by the hope of release. There is nothing ahead. Only loneliness, and the night and snow…And then there comes to Chernyshevsky a Colonel Vinnikov who hands him the government's proposal that he should send in a petition for pardon. Release and return to his native land is the promised reward."For what should I ask pardon?" replies Chernyshevsky. "That is the question…It seems to me that I have been exiled merely because my head and the head of the chief of the gendarmerie Shuvalov vary in structure, and can one ask pardon for that? Thank you for your pains… I absolutely refuse to ask for pardon…And once again time dragged on. Day after day, year after year life ebbed away.His is an active, mighty mind which so longs to work and create, which can see so far into the future! It is his hand that wrote those wrathful and impassioned proclamaitions to the Russian peasants. It was his voice that urged Hertzen not to call to prayer in his Kololeol but to call on Russia to take up the axe. All his life he devoted to one thing, strove always towards one goal—that the oppressed should obtain freedom. Even to his bride he said once: "I do not belong to myself, I have chosen another path which threatens me with prison and exile." And this man was condemned to what was for him the most terrible torture—inactivity. He was not even allowed to shake the hand of his dying friend and bid him a word of farewell.Nekrasov was dying—the news was a cruel blow to Chernyshevsky. "If Nekrasov still breathes when you receive my letter," he wrote to Pypin, "fell him that I love him dearly as a human being, that I thank him for his kind disposition towards me, that I kiss him, that I am convinced his fame will be immortal, that Russia's love for him, the most noble, the most brilliant of all Russian poets, is eternal. I sob for him…This letter took three months to arrive—and reached Nekrasov when he was still alive. "Tell Nikolai Gavrilovich," the dying man said, "that I am very grateful to him. Now I am comforted: his words are dearer to me than those of anyone else…After twenty years of hard labour and exile Chernyshevsky at last returns to his native parts. He is full of impatience and impetuosity. He rushes on, without stopping anywhere, without giving himself an hour's rest through the whole of his long difficult journey. At last he reaches Astrakhan. And here again comes a cruel blow: Chernyshevsky is deprived of the opportunity to work. Who, what magazine will publish the articles of a "state criminal"? And again inactivity, again silence and emptiness all round.Not long before Chernyshevsky's death he was visited by the writer Korolenko. Nikolai Gavrilovich refused to be pitied, recalls Korolenko. "He always had complete control of himself, and if he suffered—and could he help suffering cruelly!—he always suffered proudly, by himself, not sharing his bitter grief with anyone."Zoya read us her essay aloud. Both Shura and I said what we thought, "Very good!" "One day," said Shura, pacing about the room, "I mean to paint a big picture. It will be called 'The Civil Execution of Chernyshevsky.'""That's what Hertzen wrote," Zoya quickly put in. "He wrote: 'Will not someone paint a picture—Chernyshevsky in the pillory?' He said that such a picture would expose—how did he put it?—would expose the obtuse scoundrels who pilloried human thought.""I can see it all," went on Shura, hardly letting her finish. "Both the girl who threw flowers to him, and the officer who shouted 'Farewell!' And I can see Chernyshevsky himself at that moment, you know, when the executioner broke the sword above his head…They have forced Chernyshevsky to his knees but all the same, you can see at once from his face that he is not conquered and never will be conquered!"The next day I had scarcely appeared at the door when Shura shouted, "Mama, Vera Sergeyevna called out Zoya! And, just think, she asked about the life and work of Chernyshevsky!""Well?""'Excellent'! 'Excellent'! The whole class listened open-mouthed. Me too, although I knew it so well already! And Vera Sergeyevna was very pleased!"Zoya received an "excellent" for her essay too."She deserved it," I said."Not half!" exclaimed Shura.One might have thought that the "excellent" would mark the completion of Zoya's work. But it was not so. Her acquaintance with Chernyshevsky, his life and his books, meant very much to Zoya. Chernyshevsky became for her a high standard of thought and deed. That was the real sum total of Zoya's work on her essay.
Quote:There is a round site in the park not far from Pokrovskiye Gates with the monument to 19-th century writer and thinker Nikolai Chernyshevsky. The author of the monument is Juriy Neroda the tsarist regime to seven years of penal servitude and lifelong exile to Siberia. He wrote his famous novel "What Is to Be Done?" in the Petropavlovskaya Fortress, in the dreadful Alexeyevskiy Ravelin.
Quote:What Is To Be Doneby Nikolai Chernyshevsky, 1863"About 2:30 a.m., on a dark, cloudy night, there was a sudden flash of light and the sound of a shot from the middle of the Liteiny Bridge. The night watchmen ran toward the noise and a few passers-by gathered around. But no one was there and there was nothing left on the spot from which the sound had come. It appeared that someone had shot himself, rather than shot at someone else. A few men volunteered to dive; after a while some boathooks were produced and then even a fisherman's net. They dived, searched, fished around, caught some fifty large spars, but failed to retrieve even one body. How could they? It was so dark! During those two intervening hours the body must have been washed out to sea. Go and search along the shore. There emerged, as a result, a group of "progressives" who rejected the previous proposition: "Perhaps there never was a body. Maybe it was some drunk or mischiefmaker fooling around - someone who fired a shot and then ran off. Or else, I wonder, could he be standing here right now among this bustling crowd, chuckling about the fuss he's caused."But the majority, as always when they are behaving sensibly, turned out to be "conservative" and defended their position: "What nonsense! Fooling around! No, someone put a bullet through his head and that's all there is to it!" The progressives were defeated. But, as usual, the victorious party split immediately after its victory. All right. So he blew his brains out. But why did he do it? Some of the conservatives were of the opinion that he was "dead drunk"; others argued that perhaps he had "gone broke". Someone else observed that he was simply a fool. On this view, "simply a fool", everyone was in agreement, even those who denied that he had shot himself. Indeed, whether it was someone drunk or broke who had shot himself, or some mischiefmaker who hadn't shot himself but was only playing a trick, it was still a stupid, foolish thing to do.Thus the affair on the bridge that night came to an end. The next morning in the hotel at the Moscow Railway Station it was discovered that the fool had not been fooling around at all, but really had shot himself. But in the resolution of this affair there remained one element with which even the defeated party could agree: namely, that even if someone had not been making mischief but really had shot himself, he was still a fool. This result, satisfactory for all concerned, was particularly sound precisely because of the triumph it afforded the conservatives. Indeed, if someone had merely played a prank with that shot on the bridge, then, in fact, it would still be open to question whether the person was a fool or merely a mischiefmaker. But someone who shot himself on the bridge! Who would shoot himself on a bridge? How could it happen? For what purpose? How stupid to do it on a bridge! Therefore, this someone was undoubtedly a fool.Once again doubts began to occur: someone had shot himself on a bridge. But people don't shoot themselves on bridges; therefore, he didn't shoot himself. But toward evening the staff of the hotel was summoned to the police station to identify a peaked cap that had a bullet hole in it and had been fished out of the water. Everyone confirmed that the cap was the very one the guest had been wearing. Thus he had undoubtedly shot himself; the spirit of protest and progress was decisively defeated.Everyone was in agreement that he was a "fool". But suddenly they all declared: "How shrewd to do it on a bridge! If his aim is poor, it would obviously end his suffering at once. Good thinking! If he had been wounded, he would have fallen into the water and drowned before he could regain consciousness. Yes indeed, on a bridge...very clever!"One couldn't make any sense whatever of this whole affair: he was both a fool and very clever."

Quote:President (interrupting Dimitrov): It is none of your business to criticize us here. Dimitrov:. I have often been reproached for not taking the highest Court in Germany seriously. That is absolutely unjustified. It is true that the supreme law for me as a Communist is the programme of the Communist International, the supreme court - the Control Commission of the Communist International. But to me as an accused man the Supreme Court of the Reich is something to be considered in all seriousness - not only in that its members possess high legal qualifications, but also because it is a highly important organism of state power, of the ruling order of society: a body Which can dispose of the highest penalties. I can say with an easy conscience that everything which I have stated to this Court and everything which I have spoken to the public is the truth and nothing but the truth. As regards my Party, which has been forced underground, I have refused to make any statements. I have always spoken with seriousness and from my inner convictions. President: I shall not permit you to indulge in Communist propaganda in this Court. You have persisted in it. If you do not refrain I shall have to prevent you from speaking. Dimitrov: I must deny absolutely the suggestion that I have pursued propagandist aims. It may be that my defence before this Court has had a certain propagandist effect. It is also possible that my conduct before this Court may serve as an example for other accused Communists. But those were not the aims of my defence. My aims were these: to refute the indictment and to refute the accusation that Dimitrov, Torgler, Popov, and Tanev, that the German Communist Party and the Communist International had anything to do with the fire. I know that no one in Bulgaria believes in our alleged complicity in the Reichstag fire. I know that everywhere else abroad hardly anyone believes that we have anything to do with it. But in Germany other conditions prevail and in Germany it is not impossible that people might believe such extraordinary assertions. For this reason I desired to prove that the. Communist Party had and has nothing whatever to do with the crime. If the question of propaganda is to be raised, then I may fairly say that many utterances made within this Court were of a propagandist character. The speeches here of Goebbels and Goering had an indirect propagandist effect favourable to Communism, but no one can reproach them for their speeches having produced such results (commotion and laughter in court). I have not only been roundly abused by the press - something to which I am completely indifferent - but my Bulgarian people have also, through me, been characterized as savage and barbarous. I have been called a suspicious character from the Balkans, and a wild Bulgarian, I cannot allow such things to pass in silence. It is true that Bulgarian fascism is savage and barbarous. But the Bulgarian workers and peasants, the Bulgarian people's intelligentsia are by no means savage or barbarous. It is true that the standard of life is not so high in the Balkans as elsewhere in Europe, but it is false to say that the people of Bulgaria are politically or mentally on a lower scale than the peoples of other countries. Our political struggle, our political aspirations are no less lofty than those of other peoples. A people which lived for five hundred years under a foreign yoke without losing its language and its national character, our working class and peasantry who have fought and are fighting against Bulgarian fascism and for Communism - such a people is not savage and barbarous. Only fascism in Bulgaria is savage and barbarous. But I ask you, in what country does not fascism bear these qualities?
Quote:Rakhmetov was created by Nikolai Chernyshevsky and appeared in Chto Delat? (What is to be done?) (1862-1863) Chernyshevsky (1828-1889) was a Russian socialist, reformer, and writer; he wrote for the radical journal Contemporary. What is to be done? was his most influential work, though, giving him the reputation as a forerunner of the Russian revolutionary movement as well as a primary influence on Dostoevsky, Notes from the Underground, and Crime and Punishment. Rakhmetov is an exceptional person in many ways. Among the boatmen of the Volga Rakhmetov is known as "Nikitushka Lomof," after the legendarily huge and strong boatman hero. Rakhmetov wasn't born strong, but at age seventeen decided to improve himself, and so spent hours practicing gymnastics. Rakhmetov also spent time as a "common laborer," improving his physical strength, and feeding himself a special diet. The result was that he became exceptionally, almost superhumanly, strong. (At one point he catches the axle of a runaway wagon and holds it for long enough to stop the horses). He read widely, in philosophy, science, and literature, always trying to improve his mind and become as knowledgeable as possible. He traveled across Europe and North America, studying other languages, cultures, and peoples. The result is that Rakhmetov becomes, in the words of a critic, "the prototype of hard-headed materialism and pragmatism, of total dissatisfaction with the government, and of the self-sacrificing nobility of spirit that was the ideal of many of the radical intelligentsia." Rakhmetov is a rationalist and ascetic who prepares himself for total and complete revolution against the Czarist regime. He is, in other words, a revolutionary Doc Savage.

Quote: Berlioz was fortunate to have made his visit in 1847. After the upheavals of 1848, the final years of the Emperor’s rule were darkened still further by the spectre of revolution and conspiracy. Censorship became more prohibitive, the agents of the Third Department – the secret police – stepped up their surveillance of dissidents; private letters were routinely opened; societies were infiltrated. Among those arrested for conspiracy in 1849 was the twenty-eight year-old Dostoevskii. Along with twenty others, he was subjected to a terrifying mock execution in Semenovskii Square in the centre of St Petersburg, before being sent to Siberia. He was not allowed back to Russia until four years after Nicholas’s death.
Quote:In October of 1941, still arishchevo (Moscow Oblast) on November 27, 1941. Details of the assignment and the arrest were classified for sixty years due to the fact that there was a treachery in this case.The criminal case number 16440 was declassified in 2002. The case was then reviewed by Russia's Chief Military Prosecutor Office, and it decided, that Vasily Klubkov, who betrayed Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, is not the subject for rehabilitation. According to the criminal case 16440, three Soviet combatants: Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, Vasily Klubkov, and their commander Boris Krainov had to perform acts of sabotage on the Soviet territory occupied by the Nazis. They had the task of setting fire to houses in the village of Petrishchevo, where the Nazis were quartered. Krainov should operate in the central part of the village, Kosmodemyanskaya in the southern and Klubkov in the northern one. Krainov had carried out the task first and returned to the base. Zoya had performed her task too, as was evidenced by three tongues of flame in the southern part of Petrischevo, seen from the base. Only the northern part was not set to fire at all. According to Klubkov he was captured by two Nazi soldiers and brought into their staff. The Nazi officer threatened to kill him and Klubkov told names of Kosmodemyanskaya and Krainov, who had similar tasks to Klubkov's one. After this Kosmodemyanskaya was captured by the Nazis.[1][2]Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya was tortured and humiliated. In particular, she was undressed and beaten with rubber sticks for two or three hours by several Nazis. But Kosmodemyanskaya did not give away the names of her comrades or her real name (claiming that it was Tanya). She said: "Kill me, I'll tell you nothing" (Russian: "Убейте меня, я вам ничего не скажу"). [1] (February 16, 1942).

'We will protect you' - Mine inquiry
The Marikana Commission of Inquiry has assured provision of the government's witness protection programme for people due to testify, but who fear for their safety.
"If there is a serious threat to anyone who is a witness, they must approach the commission for protection immediately, the commission's spokesman, advocate Kevin Malunga, has said. "We want to ensure that the commission's work is not compromised."
This comes after National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) branch leader Dalivuyo Bongo was shot dead at his home in Marikana, North West, on Friday night.
On Tuesday, Bongo was among those who took part in the commision's in loco inspection of the hill where 34 people lost their lives when police opened fire on striking Lonmin mine workers in August.
Malunga said Bongo's death was unfortunate and unexpected.
"There was no sign that three days later he would be killed, we saw that there was no unity among the involved organisations but we cannot say if Bongo's death was linked with rivalry," Malunga said.
NUM spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka called the attack an "assassination". "This (Bongo's death) comes after another death, of the NUM branch chairperson last weekend and the attack on another branch leader, who escaped but his wife was killed," said Seshoka.
He declined divulging their names, saying their next of kin had not yet been informed.
Seshoka said five NUM members, two of whom were shop stewards, were killed in violence associated with a strike at Lonmin's platinum mine in Marikana between August 10 and August 16. Of the 34 people shot dead by police trying to disperse a group of protesters on August 16, 14 were NUM members, he said.
Malunga also revealed at the weekend that the commission was still consulting legal experts following a call for the government to pay legal fees to the families of the civilians who lost their lives following the Lonmin Marikana strike.
Supporting the call, Reverend Mautji Pataki of the South African Council of Churches said the government paying legal fees would be an indication that the commission was committed to "producing justice for all those who were wronged".
On Sunday, Malunga said while understanding the dire situation in which the families of the deceased found themselves, legally the commission cannot commit itself to providing legal assistance to individuals. He pointed out that such a move would put a financial strain on the already cash-strapped commission.
The commission was adjourned last week until October 22.

The revised estimate by Gartner projects that IT spending will be slightly more than previously expected, climbing three percent from the prior year's tally.
"While the challenges facing global economic growth persist -- the eurozone crisis, weaker US recovery, a slowdown in China -- the outlook has at least stabilized," said Gartner research vice president Richard Gordon.
"There has been little change in either business confidence or consumer sentiment in the past quarter, so the short-term outlook is for continued caution in IT spending."
Investments in storing data or hosting computer services in the Internet "cloud" and in telecom equipment and services were bright spots in the growth outlook, according to Gartner.
Companies were on track to spend a combined total of nearly $1.7 trillion on telecom services and $377 billion on telecom equipment in what would represent increases of 1.4 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively, from the prior year.
Researchers expected spending on public cloud services to grow from $91 billion last year to $207 billion by the year 2016.
"Business process as a service still accounts for the vast majority of cloud spending by enterprises, but other areas such as platform as a service, software as a service and infrastructure as a service are growing faster," Gordon said.

Overall rating based on: 36 of 44 (81.82 %) Customers would visit this business again
I had my bridesmaid's luncheon at Midori Salon & Spa over the weekend. It could NOT have been more perfect. Every aspect of the day was spectacular. There were 5 of us receiving massages and facials. The atmosphere was so relaxing. We had the whole area to ourselves for our party- with food, mimosas and wine- everything was so fantastic. The Midori staff always takes great care of me when I'm there and on this day it was no different- it was as if we were their only clients. I don't know how I lived before Amy's facials, and Wes' massage was seriously relaxing! Amber and her staff treated us with the utmost professionalism and made sure that we had the most relaxing day ever.I would visit this business again? Yes

When you use the Add/Remove programs feature under the Control Panel in your Windows operating system to uninstall programs, this feature does not completely uninstall the program. As a result and over a period of time, you end up with uninstall errors that affect the proper functioning of your PC's operating system. This is because there are still left over files in the registry of your computer after removing the program from the operating system.
How to Completely Uninstall a Program from Your PC
- Add/Remove Programs: Although this program does not completely uninstall a program from your PC's operating system, it is the first of several steps that you should take to completely uninstall a program from the operating system. You can use this feature by clicking on the "Start" menu on the main toolbar of your desktop and then selecting "Control Panel." Inside the Control Panel click on "Add or Remove Programs" to generate a list of programs on your PC. Select the program you want to remove and click on "Remove" to uninstall the program. When the process is complete, reboot your computer's operating system.
- Independent Uninstaller: There are several program uninstallers that you can download such as the Windows Installer Clean-Up Utility to remove programs from your computer. A lot of time the independent uninstaller will catch files that were not removed by the Add or Remove Programs option under the Control Panel. An independent uninstaller program is also helpful when the program you recently removed was quite large in size and required a lot of files for operation.
- Program Uninstall: Some of the programs you install on your computer have an additional program uninstall that is located in the folder for the program. To remove all of the files from the program you have to go to the folder of the program and then uninstall the files from there. This can also be accomplished by clicking on "Start" on the main toolbar of your desktop, selecting "All Programs" and then choosing the program you want to uninstall. Under that icon you will find an uninstall option that will help you delete the files from the folder in the program.
- Registry Cleaner: When you uninstall a program there are usually files left over in the PC's registry. This is why it is necessary to deploy a reputable registry cleaner that will remove the remainder of the files that are left over from the program that you uninstalled. The registry scans for the file entries so it can identify and remove them from the operating system. Before using a registry cleaner make sure you backup the registry on a separate portable storage device to ensure you can restore your PC to its original state if anything happens during the removal process.

The Spartan Advanced Protection System (APS)[1] is an unequaled occupant restraint system developed specifically for Emergency Response vehicles. APS includes additional airbag positions, supersized side curtain airbags, advanced seat belts and outboard sensors that enable an intelligent restraint control module. APS provides best-in-class protection against frontal impact, rollover, side impact and occupant ejection; because protection moving to and from the scene is every bit as important as what is available on-scene.
Spartan’s state-of-the-art outboard sensors protect occupants from multi-angle impacts in the cab. These sensors are mounted at the outer perimeter of the cab providing a “zone of safety” inside the cab. Each sensor communicates back to the restraint control module that monitors which airbag should deploy and under what conditions.
The outboard sensors allow for faster deployment of airbags and protect occupants from side impact collisions, rollovers and occupant ejection for all persons in the cab. Spartan is the first, and only, company in the industry whose airbags protect cab occupants from side impacts, unlike their competitors, whose side airbags only deploy in the case of a rollover.[3]
APS full side curtain airbags protect occupants from a side impact or a rollover event. Spartan’s front side airbags are up to three times larger than their competitor’s. Each of Spartan’s rear side airbags are custom sized for the crew area of every cab they build, with the largest rear side airbag covering seven times the area of their competitor’s..
In the event of a front impact collision, the upper body is slowed by the seat belt and caught by the steering wheel airbag. This protects the driver against contact injuries resulting from hitting the instrument panel or other hardware..
The APS features an industry first, advanced seat belt system which pulls the occupant into the seat in the event of an impact, or rollover. These intelligent seat belts have pyrotechnic pretensioners in the retractors instead of just a buckle. Spartan validated that pretensioners in the retractor provide more force during the initial lock. After the occupant is pulled into the seat, load limiters release some of the webbing to control the occupant’s deceleration into the airbag system. These new seatbelts help control the strain on each occupant while reducing pressure on the chest and torso, reducing seatbelt related injuries.
Spartan Chassis custom cabs are constructed with reinforced roof structures, C-channel roof supports, reinforced engine compartments, triple reinforced box front bulkheads, and reinforced front & rear step assemblies. Spartan participates in third party testing to validate the safety our cabs including, roof crush, front impact, roll stability control, airbags, seat mounting and seat belt restrain system validation. This ensures the safest Emergency Response cabs on the market.
Electronic Stability Control (ESC) is a system that helps maintain vehicle stability and aids in reducing vehicle rollovers. ESC monitors the vehicle’s rollover threshold and activates a computerized device to slow the vehicle when the threshold is approached. The prevention of accidents not only protects individuals, but it also saves your department valuable time and money.
LED lights integrated on the inside cab entry doors to alert traffic of open doors.
[1] Patent Pending [2] Optional Safety Features [3] On average, there are over 4,300 firefighters injured per year in traffic accidents. The Advanced Protection System (APS) from Spartan Chassis provides excellent protection but does not replace the need for every vehicle occupant to wear his/her seat belt.

Downhole Production Motor
Artificial Lift Company’s Advantage System is a rigless electrical-submersible-pump (ESP) solution. The system’s lightweight and compact design enables easier deployment in deviated wells and downhole monitoring with all industry-standard ESP gauges. Installation provides full-tubing access after slickline retrieval, enabling replacement operations under live-well conditions. The company’s proprietary permanent-magnet motor (Fig. 1) is one-third the length of a typical ESP induction motor and has fewer moving parts compared with an ESP induction motor. The shorter length enables the motor to operate in deviated wellbores. The 375 system (for 4.5- and 5.5-in. casing) has a horsepower range of 67 to 400 hp, and the 540 system (for 7-in. and larger casing) has a horsepower range of 250 to 900 hp. These horsepower ranges are all single-section motors, unlike a standard ESP system in which multiple motors are coupled to meet higher horsepower requirements. Electrical efficiencies and power factor are significantly higher at 90 to 93%, respectively, especially when the motor is operated in ranges from 40 to 100% of its nameplate rating.

Large-Volume Sidewall Cores
Retrieving up to 50 1.5-in.-outside-diameter by 2.5-in.-long sidewall-core samples from a single descent into a well, the Schlumberger XL-Rock large-volume rotary sidewall-coring service (Fig. 2) closes the gap between core plugs from continuous conventional core and wireline-conveyed rotary sidewall cores. These large-diameter core samples deliver a rock volume equivalent to that of conventional core plugs, matching the industry’s standard sample size for most special-core-analysis measurements and enabling key answers in less time and at lower cost than with conventional coring. This coring service enables collecting sidewall-core samples equivalent to standard laboratory core plugs. Each sample is isolated for positive identification, and a summary output at surface lists all samples with the exact depth and time that each was taken. The real-time display at the logging unit confirms proper tool operation and sample acquisition. The coring tool is run in combination with a gamma ray tool to correlate with openhole logs for accurate, real-time depth control of the coring points. With this new coring capability, operators can characterize an extended reservoir interval in a single sidewall-coring descent instead of multiple sidewall-coring descents or multiple stands of whole-core retrieval.

Frac-Pump Control
Lime Instruments’ Frac Pump Control System (Fig. 3) is designed to provide pump control while greatly enhancing worker safety and maintaining the properties needed in the oil field. National Instruments’ LabVIEW and CompactRIO platforms were used for customized software development, systems integration, and hardware design and installation in extreme rugged environments. This control system offers redundant operator controls for reliability, Ethernet cable for wired control, wireless controls with dynamic Internet-protocol addressing, and a high-performance control and monitoring system that combines embedded real-time field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) technology constructed with National Electrical Manufacturers Association 4X and zone-approved packages and has an operating-temperature range of −40 to 70°C. The FPGA-based control architecture stores code on the controller, enabling operators and technicians to monitor fracturing operations from the data van, and removing personnel from the “danger zones” of a hydraulic-fracturing operation. The company is currently working with operators and service companies to address best-management practices for safety and standardization of control and monitoring applications.

Oxygen-Removal System
Global Industrial Water has developed a system to improve the offshore water-injection process. The Oxygon system uses no chemicals, weighs substantially less than conventional systems, and has a greatly reduced footprint. The membrane technology reduces the oxygen concentration in the water to less than 10 ppb. The system is rated to 300 psi and uses a simple cartridge-replacement process to reduce downtime. The compact skid design has a low total height and weight—30% less surface area than conventional degasifiers. As shown in Fig. 4, gases in the atmosphere dissolve in water until equilibrium is reached. Equilibrium between the liquid and gas phases is offset when a vacuum and/or source of strip gas is applied, thereby creating a driving force to move gases from the liquid phase into the gas phase. The system can be expanded to allow for redundancy with multiple contactors. O2, CO2, and N2 are controlled with one device. The system is environmentally friendly, is safe for employees, and does not require chemicals to operate.

Downhole Drilling Motors
Sperry Drilling, a Halliburton business line, has introduced the SperryDrill XL/XLS and GeoForce XL/XLS series motors (Fig. 5) to its fleet of positive-displacement drilling motors. This series of motors delivers 80% more power, 65% more torque load, a 50% increase in operating differential pressure, and a shorter bit-to-bend distance for improved build rates. These motors afford more consistent power delivery to the bit while retaining power in reserve to withstand tough drilling conditions. In addition to providing more power, the motors are able to achieve higher build rates, unattainable with conventional motors, because of a shorter bit-to-bend distance. GeoForce motors have an internally contoured stator housing lined with uniform-thickness elastomer. They have accurately sized and matched rotors and stators based on downhole operating temperature, with an operating-temperature rating of 375°F, and a unique internal design that effectively resists heat degradation. These motors have been run in North and South America and in the Middle East.

Real-Time Logging
Empirica, a member of Reservoir Group, is launching its Live Logging (Fig. 6), a real-time cloud-based system that allows operators and geologists to interact with wells from any computer or device at any time during the drilling process. This new technology will dramatically reduce the time required to view well data. The system enables instantaneous interaction, potentially optimizing the well-construction process. The system captures the human component of surface logging by allowing geologists to interact with personnel at the wellsite. The system also provides geologists and operators access to static data instantaneously, as well as the ability to see the notes, pictures, and interpretations made by the mud-logging engineer. This technology provides a full picture of what is happening on the rig, enabling operators to make better decisions about their asset.

Operational Platform
Weatherford’s Enterprise Operations Platform provides cross-functional production users access to oil and gas operations, analysis, and optimization data. The network-centric architecture of the platform (Fig. 7) collects and processes real-time data from tens of thousands of field devices. Reference implementations of the platform have proved its capability to process in excess of one billion data updates from more than 15,000 field devices during a 24-hour period. The native historian function processes in excess of 5,000 values per second. This huge volume of operational information generated by large, diversified oil- and gas-production operations in the field is managed by the platform making a complete operational view of the business possible. Operational and business users across functional and geographic boundaries use this information to facilitate better decision making that drives increased operational efficiency and regulatory compliance. The platform’s deployment uses a flexible configuration and open integration. The system incorporates many configurable tools and utilities that provide efficient mapping of operational assets to integrate seamlessly with existing information-technology infrastructures by use of industry standards.

Predictive Risk
Petrotechnics’ Proscient is an enterprise operational-performance and predictive-risk software platform (Fig. 8) that provides senior management with the ability to reduce operational risk, optimize performance, and drive continuous improvement across their global operations. Stakeholder expectations of operational performance have never been higher. The key to managing these expectations is to demonstrate good governance and the ability to deliver performance in a responsible and sustainable manner. The biggest area for operational risk is when people interact with a plant to perform repair and maintenance work. It is the largest area of high-potential incidents, the second leading cause of fatalities, and a significant contributing factor in process-safety incidents. This software addresses the critical area by intelligently embedding corporate, regional, and local policies and processes, ensuring that they are delivered consistently in frontline practice. It captures data as a part of routine work processes and enables establishing common metrics that can be used across an organization to better understand the operational risk associated with the work being performed.

Chelsea players must share blame, says Cech
Image by: Toby Melville / REUTERS
Chelsea’s players must shoulder the blame for the Londoners becoming the first holders to leave the Champions League at the group stage, goalkeeper Petr Cech said after Wednesday’s exit.
The champions went out of the competition just 200 days after they won it in Munich under former manager Roberto Di Matteo.
Di Matteo was sacked last month, and replaced with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez in a deeply unpopular move for the club faithful, but Cech said the players were ultimately responsible for their poor performances.
“Unfortunately if you change your manager, you only change the manager. But the responsibility is on everyone,” he said after a 6-1 defeat of Danish side Nordsjaelland at Stamford Bridge was not enough to see Chelsea through after Juventus beat Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0.
“We are all in the same boat, the manager and the players. The responsibility is the same for everyone. You are a team,” added Cech, the stand-in captain in the absence of injured duo John Terry and Frank Lampard.
The goalkeeper was echoing the view of Terry, who had written in the match programme that it was time for the players to stand up and be counted.
“Let’s not beat around the bush. No wins in six games is simply not good enough and since I have been here I have not experienced a run like this,” he declared. “We as players have to stand up and take responsibility — stand up and stay together.”
Chelsea finished third in Group E and qualified for the Europa League after ending level on points with second placed Shakhtar, who beat them in Ukraine and went through on their head-to-head record.
The continent’s second string club competition could prove a distraction to the club’s Premier League ambitions, with champions Manchester City now out of Europe altogether, but Benitez said it would not be dismissed.

T Test and One-Way ANOVA
When there are three or more levels for the nominal variable, a simple approach is to run a series of t tests between all the pairs of levels. For example, we might be interested in the heights of athletes in three sports, so we could run t test for each pair of sports. (Note that this approach is not the same as a paired t test. That comes later.) A more powerful approach is to analyze all the data in one go. The model is the same, but it is now called a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the test statistic is the F ratio. So t tests are just a special case of ANOVA: if you analyze the means of two groups by ANOVA, you get the same results as doing it with a t test.
The term analysis of variance is a source of confusion for newbies. In spite of its name, ANOVA is concerned with differences between means of groups, not differences between variances. The name analysis of variance comes from the way the procedure uses variances to decide whether the means are different. A better acronym for this model would be ANOVASMAD (analysis of variance to see if means are different)! The way it works is simple: the program looks to see what the variation (variance) is within the groups, then works out how that variation would translate into variation (i.e. differences) between the groups, taking into account how many subjects there are in the groups. If the observed differences are a lot bigger than what you'd expect by chance, you have statistical significance. In our example, there are only two groups, so variation between groups is just the difference between the means.
I won't bother with trying to represent this model as an equation like Y = mX + c. Suffice to say that it can be done, simply by making an X variable representing sex that has the value 0 for females and 1 for males, say (or vice versa). So it is also a "linear" model, even though we don't normally think about it as a straight line. The parameters in the model are simply the mean for the females and the mean for the males.
The spreadsheet for analysis of controlled
trials includes a comparison of the means (and standard deviations) of two
groups at baseline. You can use it for any tests of two independent groups,
as in the above example.. Ignore all the stuff related to comparisons of changes
in the mean in the two groups.
Comparisons of Means
With a t test, the thing we're most interested in is, of course, a comparison of the two means. You should think about the best way to express the difference in the means for your data: raw units, percent difference, or effect size. And don't forget to look at and discuss the magnitude of the difference and the magnitude of its confidence limits.
With three or more levels for the nominal variable, we can start asking interesting
questions about the differences between pairs or combinations of means. Such
comparisons of means are known as estimates or contrasts.
For example, suppose we are exploring the relationship
between training hours per week (the dependent variable) and sport (the nominal
independent variable). Suppose sport has three levels: runners, cyclists, and
swimmers, as shown. We can ask the question, are there differences overall between
the sports? The answer would be given by the p value for sport in the model.
And what about the difference between cycling and running? Yes, we can dial
up the difference and look at its p value or confidence interval. We do that
by subtracting the value for the parameter (the mean) for cycling from that
for running, using the appropriate syntax in the stats program. We could even
ask how different swimming was from the average of running and cycling, and
so on. There's also a special kind of contrast (polynomials)
you can apply if the levels are a numbered sequence and you want to describe
a curve drawn through the values for each level.
If you're expressing a difference between means as an effect size, the standard deviation to use in the calculation is the root mean square error (RMSE) in the ANOVA. An ANOVA is based on the assumption that the standard deviation in the same in all the groups, and the RMSE represents the estimate of that standard deviation. You can think of the RMSE as the average standard deviation for all of the groups.
With lots of contrasts, the chance of any one of them being spuriously statistically significant--in other words, the overall chance of a Type I error--goes up. So stats programs usually have built-in ways of controlling the overall Type I error rate in an ANOVA. Basically they adjust the p value down for declaring statistical significance, although you don't see it like that on the printout. These methods have statisticians' names: Tukey, Duncan, Bonferroni... They're also known as post-hoc tests or simply post hocs. I don't use them, because I now use confidence limits and clinical significance rather than statistical significance, so I don't test anything.
One approach to controlling the Type I error rate with multiple contrasts is
simply not to perform the contrasts unless the overall effect is significant.
In other words, you don't ask where the differences are between groups
unless there is an overall difference between groups. Sounds reasonable,
but wait a moment! If there is no overall statistically significant difference
between groups, surely none of the contrasts will turn up significant? Yes,
it can happen! There's jitter in the p values, and there's nothing to say that
the p value for the overall effect is any more valid than the p value for individual
contrasts. So if you've set up your study with a particular contrast in mind--a
pre-planned contrast--go ahead and do that
contrast, regardless of the p value for the overall effect. Performing the pre-planned
contrast does not have to be contingent upon obtaining significance for the
overall effect. Those of us who prefer confidence intervals to p values can
understand why: the estimate of the difference between groups has a confidence
interval that may or may not overlap zero, and the confidence interval for the
overall effect (expressed in some measure of goodness of fit) may or may not
overlap zero. There is no need to reconcile the two.
Goodness of Fit
What statistic do we use to talk about how well the ANOVA model fits the data? It's not used that frequently, but you can extract an R2 just like you do for a straight line. The R2 represents how well all the levels of the grouping (nominal) variable fit the data. More about goodness of fit soon.

R.A. Dickey Forced To Remove Daughters Bracelet
New York Mets ace knuckleballer R.A Dickey experienced, as he put it, “a bizarre outing” Wednesday night. First, he was asked to remove friendship bracelets that his daughter made him. Umpiring crew chief Jim Joyce, following an MLB directive, asked Dickey to cut the bracelets off during the second inning.
Dickey went on to allow 10 hits, including three home runs, and two walks in six innings of an eventual 6-1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He didn’t appreciate the bracelet episode but wouldn’t use it as an excuse.
“I was a little angry at first but they asked me to cut them off and I did,” Dickey said.
He later added: “When you throw mediocre knuckleballs and (hitters) don’t miss them, they can be hit a long way.”
Dickey’s daughters made the bracelets for him for climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in January.
“I’ve had them on for every start, every bullpen session, since January. I didn’t think about it every inning,” Dickey said.

=== Houston hopes for first road win at K.C. ===
Kansas City, KS (Sports Network) - Sporting Kansas City wraps up a nine-match
homestand Saturday at Livestrong Sporting Park against the Houston Dynamo, who
are yet to win a road game in Major League Soccer this season.
K.C. has accumulated 14 of a possible 24 points during the record home stretch
and is coming off a 2-2 tie against the Los Angeles Galaxy on Monday, when the
tying goal came in stoppage time from Omar Bravo.
"I think we have a pretty solid base. We just need to continue to play well at
home and really put pressure on teams," said Sporting's Graham Zusi. "We need
to continue to be hard to play against and hard to score against.
"I think going forward we can grow from this (Los Angeles) game."
Sporting (9-8-10) scored in the 89th minute or later to secure a draw for the
fourth time in its last 10 games, and is just three points behind the Columbus
Crew for first place in the Eastern Conference.
In addition, K.C. just two points ahead of the Philadelphia Union and Houston,
both even on 35 points, for a top-three finish and a guaranteed playoff spot.
With the standings so tight, and fourth place not good enough to secure a spot
in the postseason, K.C. coach Peter Vermes is proud of his club for claiming a
share of points on all of those occasions.
"They've got unbelievable determination to get back in the game and they're
not going to die and that is a quality that needs to be commended because game
after game we fight for everything," Vermes said.
K.C. is 6-2-5 at home this season, as its new $200 million stadium has been an
advantage for the club, and with Davy Arnaud and Jeferson among the players on
the mend, a strong finish could lead Sporting into the postseason.
"To be honest its one game at a time right now, Houston is our biggest game of
the season, they're right under us in the table, we get them at home and will
be a good chance to gain some ground on them," K.C.'s Matt Besler said.
Houston (8-8-11) wasted a chance to move second in the standings in its recent
match, a 1-0 defeat to lowly Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Long Tan scored with four
minutes remaining, as the Dynamo allowed a goal in the closing stages for the
fourth time this season to watch its five-game unbeaten run end.
"I will say Saturday was the angriest we've been in the locker room in a long
time," Houston manager Dominic Kinnear said. "It was a missed opportunity,
especially when you look at what happened on the weekend and that it was a
chance to move forward."
Without a win on the road, the Dynamo will try to bounce back at K.C. Just two
other clubs - Vancouver and Toronto FC - have yet to win away from home, but a
win against Sporting could erase those struggles.
Houston does have eight draws in its 13 road matches, but just three squads in
the history of MLS have gone winless on the road for an entire season.
"I don't think we're playing great away from home, but we're playing the game
and we're creating a lot of scoring opportunities," Kinnear said.
Despite the setback, Houston goalkeeper Tally Hall knows the Kansas City match
is a chance to move on.
"I don't think it's hard (to bounce back), because we can look at the way
we've been playing," Hall said. "It was just one game, and it wasn't a case of
putting us in or keeping us out of the playoffs."

New York-New York Hotel & Casino
3790 Las Vegas Blvd. South Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, 89109 Tel 1-888-696-9887 Email: guestservices@nyforme.com Web site:
Awe struck us on our arrival at this relatively new hotel and casino establishment at the top of the Strip. The hotel is a replica of New York City with several skyscrapers, the Brooklyn Bridge with the Empire State Building as its pinnacle. Fortunately the hotel was built without the World Trade Center Towers, and this is because the theme of the hotel is New York in the 1930s. Inside we were treated to a quick and cosy check-in and directed to the Century Tower on the 34th floor. We hurried past some of the dramatic scenery on which we'll comment later and pushed on up to our room. The lift lobby housed six lifts, four of which were for the first 30 floors, and the others for those above and a selection of penthouses. Alighting on the 34th floor we opened into a 300 square feet 1930s decor room with spectacular views out over the Las Vegas nightlife. Lights glittered everywhere with the room capturing all of the excitement of the city. Plenty of space, tasteful decor and all the usual facilities. No mini-bar which is not unusual for casino hotels as they like you to be downstairs, so they can tempt you to gamble. Our only criticism of the room was the lighting. You could barely see at night, and the light at the entry was so dimmed it was of little use. Bedside lamps could be turned on, but again the light they gave off gave the appearance that the hotel was rationing energy. The bathroom was spacious enough, although not overly so. The guest amenties were fine, a hairdryer was provided, and in all the accommodation measured up to the reputation of one of Las Vegas's finest and newest hotels. The complex has over 2,000 rooms in its many towers. This may sound a lot however when the hotel was being built just a few short years ago the MGM Grand was under construction with over 5,000 rooms. This prompted the then owner of New York, New York when asked on radio why he was only including 2,000 odd rooms. He said "well what we're doing here is we're building a boutique hotel'. The MGM Grand group has since acquired the New York, New York. The two hotels are directly opposite, and cross-promote with a walkway between the two. Downstairs and to the action. We found a unique setting of New York in the 1930s with Times Square, city buildings and shops, restaurants, cafes and taverns. These uniquely designed buildings are scattered throughout the ground floor of the complex, and even form back-drops for the huge gaming areas. The hotel, like many of the newer hotel casinos on the Strip, also cater generously for children. From the ground floor you mount stairs or escalators to 'Coney Island' where there is a plethora of attractions, games and machines, eateries, pop corn vendors, and the hotel's famous Manhattan Express Roller Coaster. This is fun and costs just $10, with repeat rides costing just $5. Remember not to take bags, purses or mobile phones when you join the line-up, because you will be directed to leave the line and find a locker, as you cannot take them on the ride. The roller coaster envelopes the outside of the hotel, up and down and through the various skyscrapers, and is well worth the experience. We stayed three days at the New York, New York and visited just about every other hotel casino on the Strip, and went away well pleased with our choice of hotel.

. The Big Bang Theory (6.69)
The Anchor-Worthy Division
2. How I Met Your Mother (4.47)
3. Two and a Half Men (4.11)
4. 2 Broke Girls (4.11)
What a photo finish, as 2.5 Men edges 2 Broke Girls by a score of 4.11329 to 4.11325! Unfortunately, Men just keeps looking weaker by the week, including a shockingly low 3.6 demo (3.30 TRUE) in the last week of sweeps against the Daytona 500. Still anchor-worthy, but I'm wondering if maybe it should be the show to move next season so CBS can better cover their Monday bases long-term. If it continues to sag into the spring, I also think it ups the odds that CBS leaves all three shows on Monday.
The Retainers
5. Mike and Molly (3.20)
6. Rob (3.03)
7. Rules of Engagement (2.92)
If you believe the buzz, at least one of these shows (ROE and/or Rob) will not be returning, and if that's the case, it'll almost certainly be 2011-12's Truly biggest cancellation (as $#*! My Dad Says was in the same timeslot last year). I still don't really believe either of them should be cancelled.
Rob rounded out its eight-episode first season on a particularly mixed note. Its penultimate episode was, to me, a very cancel-worthy effort, a 2.9 demo out of a 5.3 for Big Bang. (But even that was a Truly stronger performance than pretty much all the bubble dramas.) The finale then dropped by 0.3 as its BBT lead-in went into repeats and lost 2.1. At least compared to the previous episode, that's a much better performance than $#*! My Dad Says (which dropped 0.5, from 2.8 to 2.3, with a similar lead-in drop). I guess the question is whether an "admirable" hold of a probably cancel-worthy performance really means anything.
The Dunzo
8. How to Be a Gentleman (1.83)
DRAMAS
The Elites
1. NCIS (4.08)
2. Criminal Minds (3.26)
They're still the elite dramas of the network, but both these shows pretty much limped through February sweeps, with NCIS losing demo each week and Criminal Minds stuck at a 3.1 even after the return of Survivor.
The Identical Quintuplets
3. Person of Interest (2.73)
4. NCIS: Los Angeles (2.68)
5. Hawaii Five-0 (2.64)
6. The Mentalist (2.63)
7. CSI (2.62)
Wow, what a packed group! If you'll recall, the first one of these I did back in December had Person of Interest closer to the bubble than to the second tier. Now, it's actually on top of the second tier, and since its better results are more recent, it's likely to keep growing. It's not exactly a Criminal Minds-level program yet (at least not consistently), but if the current trend continues, it may end up closer to Minds than to the rest of this tier. Renewal is now a formality.
The Friday-at-Best Division
8. Blue Bloods (2.14)
9. Unforgettable (2.08)
10. CSI: Miami (1.94)
11. CSI: NY (1.85)
12. The Good Wife (1.47)
13. A Gifted Man (1.35)
To reiterate what I said last time: if I'm running CBS, I keep Blue Bloods and can all the rest to make more room for comedies. What will happen? I'm guessing probably two of the other five survive: The Good Wife and one of the CSIs. But I wouldn't rule out only one making it. That goes double if upcoming NYC 22 has any pulse at all.
UNSCRIPTED
1. Survivor Fall (3.51)
2. Survivor Spring (3.30)
3. Undercover Boss (2.54)
4. The Amazing Race Spring (2.44)
5. The Amazing Race Fall (2.18)
6. 60 Minutes (1.71)
7. 48 Hours Mystery (1.33)
Since last we spoke, Undercover Boss has moved to Friday and become the top program of the evening, even if that's come at about two-thirds of its last Sunday rating. This Friday, we get to see just how powerful a truly "good faith" CBS can be on Friday, as they give legit second-tier drama The Mentalist a tryout on the evening. As problematic as the net still is on Sunday, I have to wonder if this is all leading up to an upfront in which CBS really attacks Friday again and kinda shrugs off Sunday, in much the same way the cable version of CBS (USA Network) recently has. Perhaps Friday just feels like more fertile ground to them.
But there is something good happening on Sunday: it seems The Amazing Race is that one reality franchise you can never really give up on. All three of its data points to date have been up year-to-year, and if it can keep it up, that'd basically make it the only one of its kind among reality competition shows in the 2011-12 season.

My thoughts on the CBS drama cancels (has been posted several times elsewhere):
A Gifted Man
Unforgettable
One CSI spinoff
Second hour of comedy adds:
Second CSI spinoff
(Hypothetical) Success of NYC 22 adds:
Blue Bloods or Good Wife (and this is where it gets tricky)
Agree 100%. Although I wonder if an NYC22 success may end up just indirectly killing the additional comedy hour. I have a suspicion they just plain don't want to touch the Blue Bloods/Good Wife pair.
Been thinking on this for the last few days. Maybe CBS could use Good Wife as a beta test for starting some of its dramas at midseason and running them w/ no repeat gaps. After all, even if they renew, it's probably a lame duck season anyway. Might as well experiment - see what happens w/ it. And it would still afford the space for the second comedy block, too...

“Sprigeo is a great safety valve, kids who don’t report to an adult that they were being bullied, now have another option.” - Assistant Principal Tony Howerton at Hartland Middle-School, Michigan.
The Sprigeo System is the result of thirty years of education experience, 3000 hours of software design and consultation from school administrators, researchers, psychologists, teachers, parents and students. Sprigeo functions as both an online reporting system that allows students, teachers and parents to report incidents and an adminstrative tool for identifying behavior trends and demonstrating accountability.
Contact the Sprigeo Team to begin using the online reporting system this year.
How does the system work: Students send reports through the secure online form at. School administrators receive the report details in a secure email the moment a student sends a report. Administrators can also access the reports through a secure online dashboard that allows you to identify trends in incident location, note follow-up action and create data reports.
“Sprigeo.com’s On-Line Bullying Reporting System provides a powerful resource in the ongoing efforts to keep all students safe. Students feel much more comfortable knowing they can report a bully..
Key Features & Benefits:
Cost: When purchased as a single school, 12-month subscription, the first year cost is $695 plus a one-time set up fee of $100, which we are waiving for schools that purchase Sprigeo before June of the current school year. Discounts are available for multi-school, district and multi-year subscriptions.

Questions and answers from recent viewers
Question: Does Sprigeo keep a back up of the data in the dashboard?
Answer: All data in the dashboard is backed up on a daily basis. Sprigeo utilizes a third party service called Rackspace, which delivers the highest level of security and privacy regarding their clients' data. Student data remains the sole property of the school and is never shared.
Question: Can Sprigeo be used with smart phones?
Answer: Yes. All smart phones with internet connectivity and a web site browser can access the reporting form. Administrators can also access the dashboard through their smart phone or tablet device. We are currently working on the development of a mobile app that will allow even greater access to the Sprigeo system for both students and administrators.
Question: Is there a particular password for each school to keep students from other schools from reporting?
Answer: Although we do not provide schools with unique passwords we can provide each school with a way to identify if reports are coming from the same location.
Question: What about the misuse of the system, pranks and false information?
Answer: Over 95% of the reports that travel through the Sprigeo system have been confirmed as true incidents. We attribute the low incidence of false reporting to a few factors. The reporting form requires effort from the student with the potential for little, if any, negative effect. If a student wanted to harm another student, through the reporting of false information, the use of text messaging or Facebook provide low effort, high impact options. We provide schools with a series of best practices documents that includes a template for introducing Sprigeo to students in a way that clearly identifies the purpose behind its use and the hope of creating a safe school environment.
Question: How do students access Sprigeo? Do schools add a link on their web site?
Answer: We provide you with two Sprigeo signs (8.5" x 14") as part of our best practices documents. The signs will come to you in electronic format. We ask that you print, copy and post these signs in visible locations around your school campus. The signs feature the Sprigeo logo, web site address and a reminder about reporting incidents. We can also provide you with a link to include on your school web site.
Question: Can schools use federal funding (Title I, III or IV) to purchase their annual subscription?
Answer: Yes, all three title funds may be utilized to purchase Sprigeo for your school or district. We can provide you with the justification and associated documents that will allow you to utilize federal funding in your school's purchase.

First, he wants to learn all he can about editing digital video on his new iMac DV computer.
"It was designed for novices, and that's me," said Brand, 54, of Tampa. "I need to start at ground zero and work up."
Brand chose a good time to start. Digital video is heading to the home market in a big way. While video editing on a PC has been possible for several years, it has become easier and less expensive for the home user to tackle without elaborate or expensive equipment. No longer will home computer users have to endure postage stamp-size images, nor will home videophiles need to suffer through shots of walls, floors or a wildly gyrating camera.
Jim Workman, publisher of Mac Today magazine in Dunedin, says seven years ago only a handful of people were interested in, or could afford, digital video editing. He estimates systems then cost $20,000 for the speed, power and storage necessary to handle video.
It is creating a new battlefront for Apple and Microsoft. Apple leads with its new iMac DV and iMovie software for digital video editing, which the resurgent underdog of computing has been heavily promoting in its advertising. One commercial shows computer-screen-filling images of exuberant children jumping on a bed to a backdrop of Bob Dylan's ballad Forever Young.
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has been demonstrating video editing software that will be part of the new consumer version of the Windows operating system.
And Sony's Vaio line of Windows-based computers has video editing similar to the iMac.
Nor are makers of camcorders ready to see their products reduced to "peripherals" for computers, and they're promoting alternatives. An ad for Sony's new MiniDisc Handyman, a digital camera that records on discs rather than tape, boasts that users can change the order of scenes and add graphics "without computers or costly accessories."
But Apple is getting the early attention.
"The most powerful aspect of iMovie is that it lets you do something with your computer that you haven't been able to do in the past," said Jon Bass, chief of video software at Apple. "I describe it as opening doors."
Bass emphasizes ease of use, an Apple hallmark, particularly compared to previous technology for digital editing.
"In the past, working with video has just been very difficult, very cumbersome," Bass said. "And the reason it was so difficult is because the amount of data required to work with video was so great."
Three things make video easier to do on computers than previously, Bass said: The DV file format, which compresses the video to take up less space for faster transmission. A 30-megabyte clip, for example, can be reduced to 3.6 MB.
Second, connections to transfer video from a camcorder to a computer and back again are easier to use and faster. The new connection method goes by such names as FireWire (by Apple), IEEE 1394 or Sony's iLink.
Third is the latest version of Apple's QuickTime software, which makes working with video and other media easier.
Then there's the affordable price. Digital camcorders are available for less than $1,000. (A regular VHS camera requires extra equipment to connect and convert video to digital format, available for $250 and up.)
As for the iMac DV computer, it comes in two models, at $1,299 and $1,499. Compare that with the cheapest iMac, which is not designed for video and costs about $900.
Brand, who first heard about digital video editing about a year ago, waited until the iMac DV came out and bought one in early February. A week later, he bought a Canon ZR digital camcorder on closeout for $749.
His approach to his new hobby is methodical. He's going through the iMovie tutorial a lesson at a time -- and in order. He praises Apple for keeping it simple and including a glossary of terms.
To use the iMovie software, a user clicks an icon. The opening screen includes a large window on the top left for viewing a selected clip. To its right are thumbnail-size photos showing the first frame of various video clips that are stored in the computer. At the bottom is a row where the user simply drags the clips, lining them up in order to make the video. The order can be rearranged just by clicking on the clip and dragging it.
Mac, camera, action

To its right are thumbnail-size photos showing the first frame of various video clips that are stored in the computer. Along the bottom is a row where the user simply drags the clips, lining them up in order to make the video. The order can be rearranged just by clicking on the clip and dragging it to a new position. Users can view the video frame by frame in the big window, clipping as they go to edit out what they dont want. In addition, users can add transitions such as fade-in or fade-out simply by dragging an icon between the thumbnail photos, as well as titles and music.

Brand shot test video at a favorite sandwich shop and at a condo he owns in Crystal Beach. To transfer a video clip, he simply connected the camcorder to the computer using the FireWire connector.
The only glitch during the recent practice run came when the screen went blank as Brand tried to clip some frames. He had to reboot the computer.
"I'm feeling more comfortable every time I use it," said Brand, a former CSX railroad worker now on permanent disability.
Although the movies are edited and produced on a computer, it's not practical to store the finished product there. A 5-minute video clip takes up about 1 gigabyte on a hard drive. The $1,299 iMac DV comes with a 10-gigabyte hard drive; the $1,499 model, with 13 gigabytes.
Instead, the user can transfer the finished video back to the camera over the same FireWire connector used to send the video to the computer and then to a videocassette recorder for later playback. Or the user can e-mail video to a friend, put it on a Web site to share or burn a CD to save it.
All of this is available for people starting fresh and digitally. But there's a large market for people who have collected tapes over the years.
But moving from analog tapes to digital editing takes more equipment and costs more money.
Bass recommends that those who want to edit existing analog tapes buy a digital camcorder with an input jack that allows it to copy video through a connection to the video-out jack of a VCR or an older camcorder. Such digital camcorders, Bass said, are a step above basic models and thus more expensive. For those who have 8mm tapes, Sony has a digital 8mm camcorder that can handle those. Sony also has a converter box, which lists for about $500, for transferring video between a VCR and computer.
As Apple tries to exploit the new computer video phenomenon, it has even given it a name: video publishing. It predicts the trend will have a major impact on the Internet as more people get fast connections that allow easier video streaming.
"I absolutely believe that we're going to see the same revolution with video publishing that we saw with desktop publishing," Bass said. "Right now, the only sort of prepared and packaged programs are what I see on TV. People are going to be creating their own movies, their own documentaries, their own stories."

History, success entwine goalies Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur.
By DAMIAN CRISTODERO
© St. Petersburg Times, published May 26, 2001
DENVER -- Patrick Roy said too much is made of goaltending matchups and how much they mean during the playoffs.
It is fine to stop pucks, the Avalanche goaltender said, but it is not done in a vacuum. The rest of the team must get into the act.
"You can stop all the shots except one, and you could lose 1-0, and big deal," Roy said after Friday's practice at the Pepsi Center. "As a goalie, what you want is winning games. It doesn't matter how, as long as you win."
That is fine and dandy except when juicy storylines collide, like the one coming together tonight when Roy faces the defending champion Devils and goaltender Martin Brodeur in the first game of the best-of-seven Stanley Cup final.
It is not only that the game's best goaltenders are leading the best teams. It is that the torch, even if only symbolically, could be passed from Roy, whom many consider the game's greatest goalie, to Brodeur, who one day may be.
All Brodeur has to do is beat his childhood hero.
"For young goaltenders throughout North America, this final should be a delight for them," Colorado coach Bob Hartley said. "These guys have two things in common: The red light does not go on."
How could Brodeur not have worshiped Roy as he led the Canadiens to the 1985-86 Cup? The 14-year-old Brodeur -- who grew up in Montreal and whose father, Denis, was the Canadiens team photographer -- hung Roy's pictures in his room.
They met two years later when Brodeur helped his father on a photo shoot.
"It wasn't like I was in awe of him or anything," Brodeur remembered Friday. "I was intrigued just to meet him and see how he was. Meeting him in person was fun."
Roy seemed larger than life.
"He came at a time when there wasn't much to the Montreal Canadiens, and he did so well, I think it blew everyone's mind," Brodeur said.
Roy's 484 regular-season and 133 playoff victories are NHL records. The 35-year-old also leads in playoff games (212) and playoff shutouts (17).
After his first 40-win regular season, he is 12-4 in the playoffs with two shutouts and a 1.74 goals-against average. He is trying for his fourth Stanley Cup, having led the Canadiens to the title twice and the Avalanche once.
Brodeur, 29, has won two Cups, his first with the Devils in 1994-95. His 286 regular-season victories, including three 40-win seasons, are 61 more than Roy had after eight seasons. His 62 victories in his first eight playoff seasons, including this one, are five fewer.
He is 12-6 in the playoffs with four shutouts, which ties a season record, and a 1.84 goals-against average. "It's going to be fun playing him," Brodeur said, "not because he's a guy I looked up to but because he's a clutch player. It's a great challenge to beat him."
If Brodeur's feelings are warm and fuzzy, Roy seems cool and distant when discussing his rival. Roy said he doesn't remember meeting Brodeur in Montreal. He was asked if the two are friends.
"Well, it depends what you mean by the word friends," Roy said. "We always have a lot of fun when we play like the All-Star Game and stuff," he said. "I'm not going to call him on a Tuesday night and see how he is feeling. But, I mean, I have a lot of respect for him and for what he does, and that's it."
Brodeur may have the edge. Roy sometimes goes to his knees too quickly, which means he is vulnerable high, and his puck-handling is average. Brodeur stands so upright, it is hard to find a place to put the puck. No NHL goalie handles the puck better.
Avalanche left wing Shjon Podein said the best way to beat Brodeur is to distract him.
"I think we have to get in front of him, for sure," he said. "The less he can see the less stops he can make."
Same for Roy.
"On a straight shot, you really can't beat him," Devils right wing Alexander Mogilny said. "If he sees the shot, he's pretty much 100 percent going to stop it."
Roy knows nothing is going to stop the comparisons between he and Brodeur. And if the Devils win the Cup, Brodeur will likely become the new measure of an NHL goaltender.
It's a measurement Roy has taken.
"I think Marty is the best in the league to handle the puck," he said. "There is no doubt in my mind he is playing the puck superb. He has been consistent throughout his career. A lot of people said he was protected by a great defense, but you still have to make the saves. And that's what he has done every year, and you have to appreciate that."

That's our song, sort of
Not every school can say it has a theme song by a bona fide country music star. Kentucky can. Following UK touchdowns, Tracy Byrd can be heard on the public address system singing a song with the chorus: "We know how to work and we know how to play. We're from Kentucky and we like it that way." For the record, the song is a remake, the brainchild of the UK marketing department. The original Byrd song said: "I'm from the country and I like it that way."
The new SEC rule prohibiting fans from re-entering the stadium if they leave during the game came into effect. It obviously isn't going over well with Kentucky fans. The announcement at halftime reminding fans of the rule was met by a loud chorus of boos.
There was no sign of Ashley Judd, but two other famous faces were spotted in the stands. Two members of the pop group The Backstreet Boys were in attendance. With no teenagers among the UK or USF sports information staffs, there was no one to identify just which two of the Boys were there.
"Devin (Sanderson) did an outstanding job punting and Ryan (Benjamin) had to snap on the money all night, but the bottom line is we didn't get it done as a team." -- USF kicker Bill Gramatica, on the impressive play of the special teams unit, which included his 38-yard field goal.

Independent Phone Spy Software Review!
In a world of advance technologies and inventions where diplomacy is not considered a misdeed, it’s imperative to spy sometimes. Hence the needs of a phone spy software today. The feature of the software or how it works is as necessary to know as the need to be persistent. Phone spy software is an advance device for mobile monitoring of the activities regarding information or behavior and it is simple enough to be used by non tech background people too.
After installation of the spy phone software on a mobile, it sends a message to your phone and you can make a call and the target phone creates a conference and enables you to listen to the conversation in progress from both the sides. You can listen to the surrounding sounds with the help of the intelligent software from anywhere and there will be no indication of any sort of connectivity. You receive a text alert if there is an incoming or outgoing massage from the phone and even a copy of them. The sms spy software has a status command that assures you if the software is working properly and gives you the information of the features activated. The best feature of phone spy software is that you can activate or deactivate or change or uninstall any of the features remotely on SMS commands. With the help of the phone spy software you can get the notification at once even if the sim card is changed and you get the new number used on the phone.
And if you are still worried that your number can be seen in the call log list, phone spy software gives you this freedom too as after the call is disconnected, the phone stays in standby mode and nothing can be uncovered. And if the phone is called by somebody else, it rings and functions as a regular phone.
Phone spy software is completely hidden software that is untraceable and has an intelligent auto delete feature too which represents a future proof technology. The phone spy software is a revolutionary step in the market of mobile surveillance. The only thing that should be kept in the mind while using such a necessary evil is that it should not cross the limit and is not used for any illegal activity whatsoever. Also the phone spy software should be used for the monitoring of your own family and should be made mandatory not to be misused in any circumstance. The phone spy software is meant for those responsible people who comprehend the state law and are aware that it is with the sole purpose anticipated to save your own people from something malevolent.

SIGGRAPH 2010
We had fun at this year’s SIGGRAPH in Downtown LA. We showed Glowing Pathfinder Bugs in the Art Gallery – it was interesting to present a sandpit at a heavily tech-led event, and seemed to go down well. We also presented a conference paper on the project, published in a special issue of Leonardo (vol 43, issue 4). And we did an artists’ talk.
More images here, and the project was also covered here by Core77.

The ideal flow will save energy
Various ESDs can be applied; however some requirements have to be fulfilled in order to make a device practically applicable. Thus, it should be:
- simple
- relatively inexpensive to install
- easy to maintain
- and the design should have a solid scientific background
One successful example is the so called pre-swirl stator, a device mounted close to the propeller. An approximate 5–6 percent power gain can be achieved.
The PSS is a device mounted on the boss end of the hull in front of the propeller and is designed to generate pre-swirl flow in order to improve the propulsive efficiency and thus result in power reduction.
The stator configuration that has been selected from the optimisation has four blades with a diameter equal to the propeller diameter. This has become the standard configuration for a wide range of hull types including VLCCs, tankers, bulkers, Ro-Ro ships and containerships.
The design of ESDs in general requires knowledge of flow mechanisms around ESD and highly advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computations, coupled to accurate physical model testing. In the PSS case a wide range of design parameter variation studies was first performed with SHIPFLOW computation. The most promising configurations were then selected for the final confirmation by model tests.
SHIPFLOW computations has proved to be a sufficiently complete and accurate approach for predicting the thrust, torque and rotation rate for the propeller in order to achieve the correct ranking between different design alternatives.
The model tests confirmed the relative ranking for all PSS configurations tested. Thus, CFD simulation coupled to model testing can be a cost effective approach to develop an ideal configuration of ESDs in the future.

For the past three years, the fish fry has been held to offset office costs as part of a budget crunch, said Jeff House, agronomy specialist and county program director.
"We've since overcome that and have the chance to help get a 4-H youth assistant in this county," House said.
Clara Green, 4-H youth specialist, currently coordinates the organizations in four counties, including New Madrid.
"The organization itself is stretched to the limit and I just can't do it all," Green said. "I need an assistant to maintain the local program -- I can't be there all the time."
An assistant would be more available to take and answer questions from members, Green said. Plus, having a close-to-home representative may encourage more membership.
"Just to have a face there in the county will spur interest, I think," Green said.
The Columbia 4-H office will allocate money for the assistant, House said. "We just need to come up with some matching funds," he said. "The more people we get to come through, the more we can tell if we've got support for a 4-H program in this county."
Green said she'd like to see a big crowd, too, especially former 4-H members. "It would be kind of nice for everybody to come in and talk about the old times," she said.
Extension council member Robert Henry and one of his friends will fry the fish. "We did over 150 pounds last year," House noted.
And 4-H members from the four-county area will serve the food. "That's what we're all about -- helping out each other," Green said.
On its Web site, 4-H describes itself as "a community of young people across America who are learning leadership, citizenship and life skills."
While the club still does traditional activities, such as cooking and advanced classes, it's also keeping up with the pace of technology to keep interest amongst youth. "It ain't all cows and cooking anymore," Green said, adding new courses include those dealing with GPA and robotic. "We're just moving right along with the rest of the world."

Showjumpers Melissa Julius (left), of Hawkesdale, and Kristy Haworth, of Mortlake, are off to New Zealand.
SOUTH-WEST Victorian showjumpers Melissa Julius and Kristy Haworth will take on some of the best young riders in New Zealand.
Hawkesdale’s Julius and Mortlake’s Haworth are part of a four-rider Victorian squad which will contest the Victoria-South Island exchange next weekend.
The pair leave for Waimate, south of Christchurch, next week for the January 26 and 27 competition.
Julius, 21, will represent Victoria for the fifth time while Haworth will saddle up for her second state role.
The pair have grown up together, with their friendship strengthened by a shared interest in horses.
“I think I rode before I walked,” said Julius, a stable hand for Warrnambool trainers Bill and Symon Wilde.
“The whole family, they do clerking at the racecourse so I’ve known horses my whole life.
“I can’t imagine life without them. It’s quite funny if you think about what other people do. I can’t imagine not working with horses.”
Haworth, 21, has likewise grown up around horses.
She received her first pony aged 18 months and has followed in the footsteps of her parents.
“I’ve grown up with horses my whole life. My mum and dad both showjumped,” she said. “I’m off a farm at Mortlake. Dad used to train racehorses. Both my mum and dad did.”
Julius, Haworth and their teammates, Birregurra’s Jonathon Smith and Sale’s Zoe Boulton, will ride borrowed horses at the competition.
They will have two attempts at the course on day one before swapping horses with their New Zealand counterparts on day two.
The scores of each rider contribute to an overall team score. The winning team takes home the Juliet Scott Trophy.
Victoria enters the competition — which is part of the South Canterbury North Otago Area Show — as the defending champion.
Julius said being able to succeed on an unfamiliar horse would be crucial to Victoria’s chances.
“You have to find a happy medium in how you ride and how they go,” she said.
“You’re only on them for two rounds. You’ve got to get the best result without trying to fight them.”

ALLANSFORD skipper Tim McDonald described Saturday’s upset victory over then WDCA division one ladder-leader Dennington as bittersweet.
Chasing Dennington’s 193, the 10th-placed Gators, despite the efforts of Brad Sheen (55) and Matt Brophy (41), were facing their seventh loss in 10 matches at 9-168.
But number seven Rowan Ault (33 not out) and number 11 Tom Loughnan (30) combined for a match-winning 51-run stand as the Gators finished with 219.
While they enjoyed making a splash so deep in the season, McDonald said his side had almost thrown away a good launching pad of 3-120.
“It was an entertaining game,” he said.
“It was a great win but it also shows what we are capable of, which is a bit disappointing. Our best cricket is good enough to beat anyone but we haven’t produced it for long enough.
“We haven’t made any excuses. We have been disappointed with the way we’ve played.
“It shows what can happen if you apply yourselves.”
Dennington skipper Dustin Drew said the result — his side’s first loss of the season — was no cause for panic despite slipping to second.
“I much rather than it now than in two weeks,” he said referring to the semi-finals.
“If you had said at the start of the season we would finish in the top four and have our first loss in round 10, I would have said you were kidding.
“It was disappointing to lose but you can take a few things out of a loss.”

One of the hottest college baseball teams in the country is headed to the warmth of the Sunshine State.
The Mississippi State Bulldogs, under fourth-year head coach John Cohen, will participate in the Tallahassee (Fla.) Regional, which will be hosted by the No. 3 nationally-seeded Florida State Seminoles.
“We’re excited to be playing in a great atmosphere like Florida State,” Cohen said. “Mississippi State has had success there in the past. We feel like this is one of the best fields in the country.”
MSU swept through the Tallahassee Regional in 2007 and defeated Clemson in a super regional in Starkville to make the school’s eighth appearance at the College World Series.
This year’s field once again consists of 16 regionals featuring four teams that play a double-elimination format from Friday through Monday if necessary.
The second-seeded Bulldogs meet No. 3 Samford first in Tallahassee on Friday at 11 a.m., while the No. 1 Seminoles take on another Birmingham-based school in UAB.
Even though his team is hosting and has a high national seed, it does not keep Florida State head coach Mike Martin from being a little bit nervous knowing that Mississippi State is in the field.
“We know how hot Mississippi State is in winning (eight of its last nine) games,” Martin said on ESPNU during its NCAA Selection Show Monday afternoon.
The Bulldogs (39-22) won the Southeastern Conference Tournament championship on Sunday by shutting out Vanderbilt 3-0. Along the way MSU knocked off three ranked opponents in No. 14 Arkansas 9-1, No. 2 LSU twice 3-2 and 4-3, and No. 11 Kentucky 2-1.
“It’s been a fun week and a wild ride,” said Bulldog shortstop and SEC Tournament MVP Adam Frazier. “We know it’s going to be a tough regional at Florida State; and we’ve got our work cut out for us.”
The Seminoles (43-15) are making their 35th-straight appearance in the NCAA Tournament, which stands second all-time. Florida State won the regular season Atlantic Coast championship, but was eliminated early in the ACC Tournament.
Samford brings a mark of 39-21 to Tallahassee, while UAB stands 32-28.
The Blazers, which is coached by former MSU assistant Brian Shoop and volunteer assistant Ron Polk, face the Seminoles in the other first-round matchup. Samford, another set of Bulldogs out of the Southern Conference, makes its first appearance in the NCAA Tournament.
The SEC led the nation with the number of teams making the tournament with eight, while the ACC was next with seven.
The winners of the 16 regionals advance to eight super regionals. Those hosts will be announced on [3] on Monday at approximately 10 p.m. after the conclusion of all regional action.
With the way the bracket is set up, the winner of the Tallahassee Regional advances to the super regional round against the survivor of the Palo Alto, Calif. Regional, hosted by Stanford.
The 66th College World Series begins play on June 15 at the TD Ameritrade Park in Omaha, Neb.

<I realized that this was cut off at the end, so I fixed it and reposted>
We found out I was pregnant on Valentine's Day. We always thought it would be difficult for me to get pregnant, since I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 21. We weren't trying, so it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
My pregnancy was relatively easy and trouble-free. At every appointment, everything measured exactly right - no morning sickness, no high blood pressure, no gestational diabetes, only gained 18 pounds. All the genetic testing came back clear - less than 1/40,000 chance of Down Syndrome, despite family history. We had a small scare in July; I started having cramps, so they brought me in for monitoring. A short time later, they told me I was just dehydrated, so to drink more water.
The baby was very inset in my abdomen, so I barely looked pregnant, though I felt it. Unless I told people, they could not really tell I was pregnant until around 8 months. I still wore many of my regular clothes and could never make maternity clothes fit properly.
We heard a perfect heartbeat at 10 weeks. We saw our first glimpse on ultrasound at 12 weeks; a little bug bouncing up and down and all around. At 20 weeks, we learned we would have a daughter, though I had felt sure for weeks that we would. No boy names ever felt right, blue clothes never looked right. I was always meant to have a girl.
In June, we chose her name: Scarlett Grace. No special reason, we just loved the sound of it. Chris was adament that we choose a name that was less common than his; he did not want our child to always have to use her last initial as he had - "Chris W."
As my due date approached, I slowed down a lot. I stopped working on September 29, when my sister was admitted to the hospital. Once maternity leave began, I was not sure what to do with myself. I puttered around the house, folding clothes and blankets over and over to make them just right. I walked the dog around the block every day to try to jumpstart labor.
At 37 weeks, I was 1 cm dilated. At 38 weeks, still 1 cm, my OB/GYN told us that we were looking at a big baby, at least 8-8.5 pounds. She suggested we could induce as early as 39 weeks if we wanted to. At my 39 week appointment, after my sister lost her baby, we asked to please induce just to have a plan. We didn't think we could stand the stress of waiting and rushing around, and wanted the family to be prepared and calm. The midwife told me again I was carrying a big baby.
On Friday, October 15, I was scheduled to induce, planning for delivery the next day, right on my due date. That day, as I waited impatiently, trying to rest, I talked to my sister on the phone. We were discussing contractions, and then I suddenly had one. It was pretty mellow, so I just took a nap and waited. At 7pm, I called the hospital to see if they were ready to induce me. I expected them to say no, it's too busy, just stay home. Wrong! They said, "Come on in, we're ready for you." We checked in, got settled and prepared to meet our dream girl.
I was 3 cm when I was admitted. They began Cervadil at 9pm and told me to rest, that they would monitor contractions I was already having and reevaluate in the morning. At 9am, I was 4 cm, so they broke my water and began Pitocin. There was meconium (baby poop) in the amniotic fluid, so the doctor said it was lucky I was there already. As soon as my water was broken, the pain began. I got an epidural shortly after; the first try didn't work, so I got a second.
The baby started to show signs of distress. They put an oxygen mask on me and made me lay on my side, turning me every hour; my legs were too numb to turn myself. By 2pm, I was barely 5 cm, and the doctor was getting worried. We learned later that she had begun preparing for a C-Section just in case.
Suddenly, there was progress. I was 8 cm, then 9. The doctor said it could still take a few hours to be ready; I refused to believe that. Contractions were tolerable but painful and I was tired and anxious. I started to push on my own during contractions to get the baby moving. It worked - the next check, I was 10 and ready to push. Again, the doctor said, since it was my first baby, I might have to push for a few hours. She suggested a "test push" to see how I did...as soon as I pushed, she flew, grabbing all the nurses, throwing on scrubs and prepping the room for delivery.
20 minutes later, Scarlett made her debut. They were worried about the meconium, so they did not let her cry right away. They laid her on my chest, but the blanket covered my face, so I didn't see her. Chris cut the cord, even though he swore he wouldn't want to. As soon as they cleaned her up, she let out a cry. It was a huge relief to hear. My sister took pictures of her as they cleared her lungs so I could see her.
When they got her on the scale, she was only 6 pounds 7 ounces; what happened to that big baby I was supposed to have? We laughed that we had been so ready for her to be big, we never considered she would be small. She was finally placed in Chris' arms, as tears rolled down his face. Just days before, he was sure he wouldn't cry, that he was prepared and knew how he would feel. She was just that beautiful.

Where is it you live? I was born at Washington hospital and lived in Fremont most of my life till I moved to Livermore. Our babies are so close in age. Maybe we can schedule us some play dates when she's up for it :)
Oh and when I say play dates I mean mommy play dates! Coffee.. wine... haha.

We're always praying for you and baby Scarlett,

NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes drifted around the break-even mark in light trading Monday, one day before the U.S. presidential election.
Uncertainty surrounding the election kept investors reluctant to make big moves, said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at the brokerage Charles Schwab.
National polls show President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney."
Shortly after noon, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 12 points to 13,081.
Frederick said he believes that no matter who wins, the stock market will likely surge once it's over for the sole reason that investors will know the name of the next president.
In other Monday trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 index lost one point to 1,413, while the Nasdaq composite index rose seven points to 2,989.

TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Vice President Joe Biden made an aggressive entry into the 2012 campaign Thursday, calling out Mitt Romney and the other Republican presidential hopefuls by name for their failure to support the auto bailout.
In his first major campaign address, Biden cast President Barack Obama as an advocate for the middle class, while labeling Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum as protectors of the privileged.
"If you give any one of these guys the keys to the White House, they will bankrupt the middle class," Biden said at a United Auto Workers hall in Toledo in the politically important state of Ohio.
Biden directed much of his fire at Romney, the GOP front-runner. He singled out the former Massachusetts governor, a native of the U.S. auto industry's home base of Michigan, for saying the government should let the auto industry go bankrupt and that a bailout would turn the car companies into the "living dead."
"Gov. Romney's predictions of a living dead? We have now living proof: a million jobs saved, 200,000 new jobs created," Biden said as the crowd of about 500 erupted in cheers.
Seeking to draw a direct contrast between Romney and Obama, Biden said: "The president didn't flinch. This is a man with steel in his spine."
Thursday's speech marked the first of four general election events Biden will hold in the coming weeks as the Obama campaign takes sharper aim at the Republican field.
"Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich have a fundamentally different vision," Biden said. "We're about promoting the private sector. They're about protecting the privileged sector."
Biden was greeted at the union hall with chants of "Go Joe, Go!" and "Four More Years." The crowd behind him held Obama-Biden 2012 signs.
"I'm back. You're back," Biden said as he revved up the crowd. to stay above the political fray for as long as possible.
While the three campaign principals -- Obama, Biden and first lady Michelle Obama -- have been headlining campaign fundraisers for several months, officials say the president won't hold campaign-sanctioned public events until after Republicans pick their nominee.
But many of the events Obama has held in recent months, which the White House has said are "official," have sounded like campaign events, including nameless references to the GOP candidates vying to replace him. That goes for a speech Obama delivered Thursday in Maryland, fighting back against Republican criticism of his energy record.
The first lady's campaign strategy is still being crafted, though she is expected to play an active role in the general election.
Biden's campaign strategy has been in the works for several months, and its early rollout underscores his importance to the Democratic ticket.
Heading in to the November election, Biden is expected to target the big three political battlegrounds -- Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Obama carried all three in 2008, but will face an uphill climb in each come November given the toll the recession has taken on those states.)

BILBAO, Spain (AP) -- Athletic Bilbao dominated Manchester United again and showed it is certainly a favorite to win the Europa League after a 2-1 victory that put it into the quarterfinals on Thursday.
The young Basque side picked up right from where it left off in the 3-2 first-leg win as Fernando Llorente and Oscar de Marcos scored either side of halftime in another thrilling, up-tempo game.
Wayne Rooney scored in the 81st for United to complete the Spanish league club's 5-3 aggregate victory, which should have been by a bigger margin.
United's forgettable European campaign saw the English Premier League leader follow up an unexpected Champions League exit by dropping out of the continent's second-tier tournament, which Bilbao must be regarded as one of the favorites to win after reaching the last eight of a European competition for the first time since 1977.
"This has been incredible," De Marcos said at San Mames Stadium.
Alex Ferguson's team failed to respond to counterpart Marcelo Bielsa's tactics, and against another Spanish opponent that thrives off possession and quick touches as Barcelona did in beating the Red Devils in two of the past three Champions League finals.
"I don't think we can complain of the result," Ferguson said.
Lanky striker Llorente powered home the 23rd-minute opener as he volleyed Fernando Amorebieta's cross from the left past United goalkeeper David de Gea.
De Marcos was rewarded for his game-long efforts in leading Bilbao's attack when his shot from a step inside the area took a friendly deflection to leave De Gea helpless and United dejected after 65 minutes.
While Rooney secured some dignity for the visitors with an impressive strike, United was lucky to escape complete humiliation only because of Bilbao's lack of finishing in a second half where it could have added a handful of goals to the final tally.
"When you have to quantify a result and the rival is Manchester, you can't ignore those circumstances," Bielsa said. "This was a matchup that deserved to be enjoyed."

In October 1999, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) revoked the 1978 decree that annexed East Timor, and the UN Transitional Authority in East Timor (UNTAET) assumed responsibility for administering East Timor until it became independent on May 20, 2002.; initated investigations into the unrest; and lifted controls on the press, political parties, and labor unions. A special session of the MPR held in November 1998 advanced the date of parliamentary elections to June 1999, and the House of Representatives (DPR) rewrote the laws governing the elections.
Elections for the national, provincial, and subprovincial Nadhlatul Ulama, headed by Abdurrachman Wahid) 10%. Parliamentary seats were to be allocated according to new regulations and the 200 additional members of the MPR chosen. As described below, the MPR selected Abdurrahman Wahid as Indonesia's fourth President in November 1999 and replaced him with Megawati Soekarnoputri in July 2001.
GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS
Indonesia is a republic based on the 1945 constitution providing for a limited separation of executive, legislative, and judicial power. Substantial restructuring has occurred since President Soeharto's resignation and the short, transitional Habibie administration which followed. Each year from 1999 up to and including 2002, the MPR adopted significant amendments to the 1945 constitution. The Second Amendment (2000) included provisions guaranteeing a wide range of human rights. The Third (2001) and Fourth Amendments (2002) entailed a major restructuring of the government, providing for direct election of the president and vice president by the citizenry, as well as the creation in 2004 of a new house of Congress made up of regional representatives (the DPD). Starting in 2004, the MPR will consist solely of the DPR and the DPD. The Third and Fourth Amendments also made the executive branch no longer subordinate to the MPR, thereby creating further checks and balances in the Indonesian Government system.
The president, elected for a 5-year term (and limited to two terms in office), is the dominant government and political figure. In June 1999, the MPR elected Abdurrahman Wahid, also known as Gus Dur, as Indonesia's fourth president. Wahid proved unable to govern effectively, and the MPR impeached him in July 2001, immediately appointing then-Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri as the fifth and current president. Although Megawati is the daughter of Indonesia's first president, Soekarno, and owes her early political prominence to him, she has achieved her own political power base. The president, assisted by a cabinet that she appoints, has the authority to conduct the administration of the government. Although President Megawati's PDI-P party is the largest in Parliament, she does not have a majority. She has formed a coalition government; her vice president, Hamzah Haz, for instance, represents an Islamist party.
Under the political laws enacted in January 1999, the House of Representatives (DPR) has 500 members, of which 462 are elected and 38 appointed seats are reserved for the armed forces (TNI). The TNI seats are to be phased out. The People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) has 695 members, consisting of the 500 members of the DPR, 130 provincial representatives selected by provincial assemblies, and 65 representatives appointed by social and community groups. sociopolitical.
Indonesia embarked on an ambitious decentralization program in January 2001 that devolves substantial authority to the provincial and district levels. While the ongoing decentralization program is intended to bring government closer to the people, it also has raised questions of efficiency and national cohesion.
Principal Government Officials
President--Megawati Soekarnoputri
Vice President--Hamzah Haz
Minister of Foreign Affairs--Noer Hassan Wirajuda
Ambassador to the United States--Soemadi Djoko Moerdjono Brotodiningrat
Ambassador to the United Nations--Makmur Widodo more than 164 state-owned enterprises and administers prices on several basic goods, including fuel, rice, and electricity. In the aftermath of the 1997-98 financial crisis, the government took custody of a significant portion of private sector assets through acquisition of nonperforming bank loans and corporate assets through the debt restructuring process.. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 altered Indonesia's political and economic landscape. Since 1997, Indonesia has had three presidents and as of mid-2002, its economy is only just recovering to pre-1997 levels. Seven percent GDP growth is the level most economists consider necessary just to absorb new job seekers, but the government estimates growth in 2002 of 4% and in 2003 of less than 5%. The number of unemployed and underemployed (working less than 15 hrs/week) is currently estimated at 40 million.
President Megawati Soekarnoputri has made important strides in her first year in reducing political instability, strengthening Indonesia's relationship with the IMF, and reinvigorating the country's economic reform program. The government has completed four quarterly IMF reviews since September 2001. However, a sharp rise in anti-IMF sentiment among Jakarta politicians and commentators in mid-2002 has called into question the degree of political support for further reforms. Megawati's administration spawned a sustained increase in market sentiment during the first half of 2002, with both the rupiah and Jakarta Stock Exchange performing strongly. Consumer confidence and exports have begun to rise from their very low levels of late 2001.
The rupiah has stabilized significantly from trading at the Rp 11,440/U.S.$ level in July 2001 when President Megawati took office. After an initial surge following Megawati's election, the rupiah weakened again in the last half of 2001. Since then it has strengthened slowly to the Rp 8,800/U.S.$ level, an increase of 23%. Previously, the value of the Rupiah was very volatile ranging from Rp 2,500/U.S.$ prior to the Asian financial crisis to a low of Rp 17,000/U.S.$ after President Soeharto resigned in June 1998. Although the stability of the rupiah has returned, the approach of elections in 2004 and slower economic growth combined with high levels of debt have made exchange rate risk a major concern of investors.
The Megawati administration has made much less progress in improving Indonesia's troubled investment climate, and several adverse court rulings against foreign companies brought investment issues to the forefront of government policymaking in 2002. Besides the lack of legal certainty, existing and potential investors cite a number of concerns with respect to Indonesia's investment climate, including security, confusion over regional autonomy policies and fiscal decentralization, uneven implementation of economic reform commitments, and tax and labor issues.
Indonesia's public sector external debt rose from $54.2 billion in March 1998 to about $76 billion by the end of 2001. Private sector external debt stood at about $60 billion. The large amount of nonperforming corporate debt, estimated in late 2000 at U.S.$65 billion, is a major factor limiting capital markets growth in Indonesia. Although debtors and creditors have reached agreement on a substantial number of restructuring terms sheets through IBRA and the Jakarta Initiative Task Force, most of these agreements have yet to reach legal closing. As a result, few of Indonesia's largest corporations are creditworthy.
Oil and Minerals Sector
Indonesia, the only Asian member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), ranks 17th among world oil producers, with about 1.9% of world production. Crude and condensate output averaged 1.4 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2001. In the 2001 calendar year the oil and gas sector, including refining, contributed about 13.7% to GDP and provided 35% to domestic revenues. The sector's share of export earnings was 22.4% in 2001, a greater percentage than recent years due to high world oil prices. U.S. companies have invested heavily in the petroleum sector. With domestic demand for petroleum fuels expanding, Indonesia will become a net importer of oil by the next decade unless new reserves are found. In 2001, Indonesian imports of crude oil and petroleum products totaled $5.4 billion while Indonesian exports of crude oil, and oil products and LNG totaled $12 and makes no procedural distinction between foreign and domestic oil and gas companies. Pertamina's responsibility to manage Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), which authorize investors to produce oil and gas, will shift to the central government. 92.5 million metric tons in 2001, including exports of 66 2001, the value of Indonesian mining exports generated $3.6 billion, with receipts from copper and coal accounting for 89.7%. Other major foreign investors included Japan, the United Kingdom, Singapore, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.
Despite improvements in political stability, incomplete reform in other sectors has slowed foreign investment growth. New foreign investment approvals for the first 5 months of 2002 fell by 58% to U.S.$1.67 billion from U.S.$3.97 billion over the same period in 2001. From a record high of U.S.$33.8 billion in 1997, approvals fell 73% to roughly $9 billion in 2001. (Note: The data does not include investments in oil and gas, finance, banking, non-bank finance, insurance, and leasing. Indonesian Government approval reports should be treated cautiously and used as no more than an indicator of possible trends, because they represent applications to invest and not actual projects or money.) The recent commercial court Manulife bankruptcy ruling brought to light serious weaknesses in the judicial system. Foreign businessmen have expressed reluctance to increase investments. Investors in the manufacturing sector also are concerned by rapidly rising wages, which threaten Indonesia's competitiveness in labor-intensive industries.. Preoccupation with domestic problems has not prevented President Wahid from frequently traveling abroad and continuing to participate vigorously, though peripatetically, in many international fora. United States. has pursued better relations with Israel, and in August 2000 he met with former Israeli Prime Minister Peres.. Problems in Timor and Indonesia's reluctance to implement economic reform, have complicated Indonesia's relationship with donors. 150,000 personnel, the police form a much smaller portion of the population than in most nations. United States are good. The United States is committed to assisting Indonesia's democratic transition and supports the territorial integrity of the country. There are, nonetheless, friction points in the bilateral political relationship. These have centered primarily on East Timor and human rights, as well as on differences in the countries' respective foreign policy orientations. The U.S. Congress cut off grant military training assistance . Indonesia continues to align itself with Non-Aligned Movement and. Continuing economic malaise has increased difficulties for workers and caused an increase in child labor (10-14 years old).

“And the United States remains committed to helping the Mexican Government go after the cartels and organized crime and the corruption they generate... And we will continue, through the Merida Initiative, to provide significant support.” – Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Under the Merida Initiative, the United States has forged strong partnerships to improve citizen safety in affected areas to fight drug trafficking, organized crime, corruption, illicit arms trafficking, money-laundering, and demand for drugs on both sides of the border.
Bilateral efforts are being accelerated to support Mexico’s institutions, especially police and justice systems at both the federal and state level; to expand our border focus beyond interdiction of contraband to include facilitation of legitimate trade and travel; and to build strong and resilient communities able to withstand the pressures of crime and violence.

Thank you, Mike, for organizing this important look back on these three transformational periods in U.S. foreign policy. At a moment when our values and interests are so deeply entwined, from the Nile to the Irrawaddy, I want to thank Mike Posner and all of DRL for your irreplaceable contribution to U.S. national security and human dignity throughout the world. Under Mike’s leadership, DRL has refined and redefined our human rights agenda for the 21st century.
I also want to thank our panelists for their unique perspectives on the evolution of human rights policy. Over the past 30 years, I have had the privilege of working with virtually every panelist here today – Tom Pickering, Elliott Abrams, Harold Koh, Lorne Craner, Tex Harris, Tammy Wittes, and many other remarkable friends and colleagues. I know it is much easier to reflect from the safe vantage point of hindsight upon issues that caused gray hairs and sleepless nights. All of us are grateful for your service, your sacrifice, and your superb contributions to the cause of universal human rights.
All of us also believe that America is best off in a world of successful and stable nations, where individual rights are respected. We know that ideals and interests don’t always mesh as seamlessly as we might like. And for the tough cases, it takes judgment, persistence, and an ability to see both the forest and the trees in order to move our policy forward. Each of you faced decisions like these, and each left the State Department, and our world, a richer place.
By the time I joined the Foreign Service in 1982, DRL was already well established in its offices on the 7th floor, publishing the human rights reports under the leadership of Elliott Abrams. The Cold War dominated U.S. global security interests, including authoritarian regimes in Latin America that were critical U.S. partners. Elliott argued that if the United States was to be credible in denouncing human rights violations by Communist dictators, we had to call out violations by anti-Communist dictators as well. It meant speaking out about Augusto Pinochet as well as Daniel Ortega. That was not a popular policy, but it was an important attempt to put us on the right side of history. Only a couple of decades later, most people in the Americas live under leaders they elected, with increased respect for their rights and freedoms, greater inclusion for populations too long overlooked, and a middle class that now numbers 275 million.
Today, DRL reports on the status of human rights in 199 countries and territories, but the goal is not to chastise—it is to change behavior. During the Clinton Administration, we established the Human Rights Dialogue with China. Today, we hold these dialogues with many countries with which we have important relationships but deep differences on issues of rights and freedoms, such as Russia and Vietnam, as well as with countries whose views on these issues are closer to our own, like Colombia and Mexico. We have frank conversations grounded in our principles, and we help elements within governments put in place better practices, solve problems within their own societies, and become more accountable and more open to their citizens. And thanks to DRL, a surprising number of these difficult but essential conversations delivered results.
In 1998, DRL began funding programs to help human rights activists, including journalists, women, and other vulnerable groups, improve their own advocacy and reach. After 9/11—when our government recognized that conflict, instability, and terrorism were in many ways the byproducts of the failures of authoritarian states to modernize and advance human dignity— these efforts also gave rise to the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI), founded in 2002 to strengthen civil society and the rule of law, empower women and youth, improve and expand education, encourage economic reform, and increase political participation.
Globally, DRL has translated our human rights aspirations into action. Since 2008, DRL has trained and assisted more than 30,000 print, media, and online journalists.
In the Philippines, DRL grantees went on to produce groundbreaking reports about human trafficking, enforced disappearances, and summary executions.
In Pakistan, they launched the first women’s radio program focusing on gender issues and got the country’s first nongovernmental radio stations on the air.
One of my favorite DRL war stories is how Lorne Craner and Pat Davis, who now runs the Global Programming Office in DRL, helped to get Kyrgyzstan its first independent printing press in 2003. At the time, the country’s only printing press was owned by then-president Akayev’s family. Lorne and Pat managed to set up an international board of directors for an independent newspaper, buy a printing press, and launch it with enough fanfare that it was actually able to report the news. Seven years later, Kyrgyzstan witnessed the first-ever democratic transfer of power in Central Asia.
I am not suggesting that one printing press turned the tide of history. As is often the case, we can never precisely measure the impact of U.S. engagement. Here’s what we do know: when we work to put ourselves on the right side of history, when we support citizens working to resolve conflict peacefully, to bring change to their societies, to create economic opportunities, and to claim universal rights—we enhance our country’s interests, we enhance our country’s security, we enhance our country’s leadership, and we reflect the values and the generous spirit of the American people.
I have had the great honor and privilege of serving in government during the fall of the Berlin Wall, the uprisings in Tunis and Tahrir Square, and the new opening in Burma. The changes that have swept the world – from Bishkek to Cairo, from Seoul to Sana’a – not just in the past two years but over the past 20 years – may be about ideals we hold dear and may have had our support, but, in the end, they are not about us. They are about thousands of individual decisions made by the citizens and governments of sovereign nations. They are about the thirst for dignity of proud people in every corner of the world. They are about fundamental truths and universal human aspirations from which no society and no region is immune.
We rightly approach our engagement with a large dose of humility. And yet, looking back on the decades of DRL—a time when, through wave after wave, democracy has moved forward, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in Africa, and in the Middle East—it is clear that the world is a better place today because you took the long arc of American foreign policy and bent it toward justice.
DRL has lived by the motto, “don’t make a point, make a difference.” And when we look back at the story of American diplomacy – as we do today—it is clear just what a difference you have made. You help us to be the nation we aspire to be. And you help us exercise leadership in a more peaceful and a more secure world.
But our work is far from done, and with the growing voice of civil society around the world, we need DRL now more than ever. All of us understand the tough work ahead—from stopping the horrific shelling of civilians in Syria to rebuking incitement against LGBT persons around the world; from standing up against honor killing to ending forced labor; from nurturing new democracies to making sure that, while a government may throw prisoners of conscience in jail, no government can make the world forget about them.
Fortunately, we have one of the most passionate advocates I know as our Secretary of State. Through her words and her deeds, Secretary Clinton has used her unique stature, her frankness, her courage, and her conscience to fight for and win a place on the world stage for so many who had been relegated to the shadows: from women, to LGBT persons, to religious minorities, to youth, to the disabled. And by helping so many people live up, as she would say, “to their God-given potential,” she has helped this Department and this country live up to our potential.
We look forward to continuing down the road of history with you. Thank you and keep up the great work.

EAST ORANGE WATER COMMISSION FINED $402,000 FOR VIOLATING STATE
WATER QUALITY REGULATIONS
Independent State Sampling Shows Water Quality is Safe for Consumption
(13/P17) TRENTON – The Department of Environmental Protection has issued two Administrative Orders that include penalties of $402,000 against the East Orange Water Commission (EOWC), alleging the water purveyor in 2010, 2011 and 2012 manipulated water samples and test results so that required reports sent to the state minimized the levels of contaminants in the water supply, DEP Commissioner Bob Martin announced today.
The Administrative Orders allege that the EOWC violated numerous state regulations regarding record keeping, accurate reporting of required water sampling, public notification of water quality violations, water quality remediation, and access by state inspectors to water system records and documents. EOWC also is alleged to have discharged water with elevated levels of a contaminant into the Passaic River.
“We have a high standard of accountability in this state when it comes to the safety and reliability of drinking water,’’ said Commissioner Martin. “It is imperative that water providers maintain and provide to us accurate records of water system operations. Any deviation from those standards is a violation of the public trust.
“Thankfully, independent tests by the DEP find the water quality for residents of East Orange and South Orange to be safe. We will continue to closely monitor this water supply.’’
A state grand jury this month indicted East Orange Water Commission Executive Director Harry L. Mansmann, 58, of Lawrenceville, and the system’s licensed operator and Assistant Executive Director William Mowell, 51, of Wyckoff for allegedly conspiring to manipulate the agency’s water supply by shutting down contaminated wells prior to monthly water tests to falsify test results and report lower levels of a regulated contaminant in the drinking water supplied to customers.
Mansmann and Mowell were charged with conspiracy, official misconduct, unlawful release of a toxic pollutant, multiple counts of violating the New Jersey Safe Drinking Water Act, violating the New Jersey Water Pollution Control Act and tampering with public records or information.
The indictment stems from an investigation by the Environmental Crimes Unit of the Division of Criminal Justice Specialized Crimes Bureau, which resulted from a referral by the DEP’s Compliance & Enforcement Program. Mansmann and Mowell allegedly conspired to falsify mandatory testing of the EOWC’s water supply to hide elevated levels of the contaminant tetrachloroethylene (PERC), an industrial solvent used for dry cleaning and other purposes.
Prior to the indictment, the DEP had issued administrative orders to the EOWC for violating terms of water allocation permits and inhibiting access of DEP inspectors to commission documents, which prompted an order suspending Mowell’s license to operate a potable water system. That license suspension was pending an administrative hearing at the time of the indictment.
The EOWC supplies water to about 75,000 residents in East Orange and 17,000 customers in South Orange from 18 wells located in Millburn, Livingston and Florham Park. has encountered problems in several wells with elevated levels of PERC, which is commonly found in groundwater in urban areas.
The DEP’s Administrative Orders allege that water with an elevated content of PERC was pumped from a Florham Park well into the Passaic River, from March 24 to April 11, 2011.
DEP also alleges that EOWC:
The DEP has done independent testing of the East Orange water system. The results of the most recent samples in February show PERC levels below state acceptable standards of one part per billion, and far lower than the federal standards of five parts per billion. The DEP is continuing to monitor the water system.

Does the HMO help members stay healthy and avoid illness?
A comparison of each HMO’s performance to the New Jersey HMO average shows how effective the HMOs are in working with doctors to provide important preventive services that help members stay healthy.
Higher than average scores mean better performance.
Due to differences in sample size, HMOs with the same or similar scores can have different circle ratings.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) - Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly is expecting another physical game when No. 17 Stanford visits the undefeated Irish on Saturday.
After watching his team get pushed around by the Cardinal (4-1) the past two seasons, Kelly says he is expecting a backyard brawl-style game. The Cardinal had never won two straight in the long-running series against the Irish (5-0) until taking the last three games, including Notre Dame's most lopsided loss under Kelly two years ago.
This will be Stanford's second road game of the season, following a 17-13 loss at Washington on Sept. 27. The Cardinal are just 3-10 all-time at Notre Dame Stadium.
Stanford coach David Shaw says the challenge for the Cardinal is to play their best game on the road.

Auckland rent data: too hard basket
Juha Saarinen, on Twitter, asks for data addresses the Auckland rent shock headlines.
Detailed data on new rentals are available from the ‘market rent’ pages at MoBIE, but there doesn’t seem to be any way to download the whole thing, just individual neighbourhoods. And it’s a long weekend.
Thomas Lumley (@tslumley) is Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Auckland. His research interests include semiparametric models, survey sampling, statistical computing, foundations of statistics, and whatever methodological problems his medical collaborators come up with.

Alas it is true, you have to undertake an extensive point-and-click exercise to get the numbers and historical data isn’t available. Goodness knows why this is the case, as the data is really only useful once seen in a historical context. And certainly, historical data is the only way to determine whether the trend is slow and steady or a “shock”.

Not true at all. For people looking to rent (either as landlord or tenant), this is a very useful resource.
110 days ago
Exactly: it’s quite useful for what it’s designed for (though you could imagine improvements, like an interactive map — I must suggest this to Paul Murrell in case he has a student looking for examples).
It’s useless for a lot of other purposes, and it’s a pity MoBIE don’t make more information available in bulk. They do have to be a bit careful about disaggregation — rental prices are not public information — but it would still not be too hard.
110 days ago
It’s a fair point, but I’d still argue that knowing the relative changes in the rent over time is important to a new renter, particularly in places such as Christchurch where the changes in rent are (how can I put this kindly?) somewhat chaotic. In this respect, the media does not help since they use phrases such as “sharp” or “shock” rises to describe changes, using data that the rest of us doesn’t have access to. I’d also like to know the effect that true rents differ from these statistics, given that the statistics are based on bond returns. Again, Christchurch peculiarities apply here…

Trail Detail
Mecham Hollow Intermediate ATV-Motorbike Loop
Know Before You Go!
Check weather and trail conditions before you head out. Contact information here.
Just northwest of Montpelier lies an extensive network of singletrack motorbike trails, ATV trails and forest roads that create loops of varying length and difficulty for OHV riders and other users. It'd be easy to spend an entire day getting lost in this fishnet of routes. This 8-mile ride is intended to provide an introduction to the area for ATV/motorbike riders. See the Mecham Hollow-Sherman Peak Loop or the Paris Canyon-Highline Trail Loop for longer rides in the vicinity.
To reach the Mecham Hollow trailhead, take U.S. Highway 89 west out of Montpelier and head for Ovid. Turn right on State Highway 36 in Ovid and drive into the mountains. Just before you reach the Caribou-Targhee National Forest boundary, turn right on Forest Road 401. Go past the North Canyon trailhead, and follow Road 401 about 3 miles to the Mecham Hollow Trailhead. Park. The ride starts here. There is some primitive camping at the trailhead, but there are no services such as water or a toilet.
To begin the ride, go west on Road 401 for less than a mile, then turn right on Road 951. In less than a mile, turn right on Trail 442 and ride some twisty trail. Bear right on Trail 442A at the next junction. In a little over a mile, turn right on Road 404 and follow that to Road 401. Go left on Road 401, then peel right on Trail 344, then right again on Trail 345. Follow that for about two miles to a junction at Road 402 and Road 439. Follow Road 439 to Road 425. In a half-mile, go right on Trail 316 at the next junction, and follow it back to the trailhead.
These trails and roads are open for the summer season. In most years, snow will prevent access to this ride until mid-June.

Expansion on drawing board
Administrators seek options for middle school
Wednesday, November 6, 2002
Steamboat Springs The Steamboat Springs Educational Fund Board approved funding for the architectural drawings of an expansion to Steamboat Springs Middle School.
The middle school has been in need of extra classrooms to accommodate the growing number of students, said Rick Denney, district facilities director. To account for the immediate need for extra classrooms, the middle school's gym was remodeled last summer into a two-story room that added two additional classrooms and a mat room for wrestling practice.
However, this addition was only a temporary solution to the growing problem.
Denney said the options for adding classrooms to the existing middle school were explored for cost effectiveness. He said adding an expansion to the back of the building would be the most cost effective because building within the school's infrastructure would require replacing portions of the ventilation system.
The $75,000 gift from the fund board will allow Denney to get architectural drawings of the expansion and determine its cost.
He said getting funds for the design work is only the beginning and hopes he will receive funding for the expansion as well.
Denney said if funding is not approved, the district will have to find other funding options that may include trying to pass a bond during the next election. Ideally, he said, he would like the construction to begin this summer so the expansion could be completed by the 2003-04 school year.
In addition to the middle school expansion, the fund board heard the first reading of a proposal request for three aides in the third grade at Strawberry Park Elementary.
"We are trying to give students more time with a teacher or aide we're hoping it will result in an increase in education," Strawberry Park Principal John DeVincentis said.
DeVincentis said the ideal situation would be to have an additional teacher in the third grade to reduce the class size of 23, which is the current number of students in third-grade classes at Strawberry Park. He said with the school year in progress, adding a new teacher would not be the best option.
With new aides, who will receive training and be integrated into the classrooms, DeVincentis said he hopes students will have the same benefit of having a smaller class size.
The current third-grade class has had a larger class size since the students' first-grade year, DeVincentis said.
He said parents have addressed their concerns about having a continually higher class size because of evidence showing the benefit of small classes from the kindergarten through third-grade years.
The fund board will be issuing a proxy vote on the issue in the next couple of days to ensure aides will be added to the classrooms as quickly as possible if the proposal passes.
"We have never not been responsive to a commission who needs a quick answer," said Jim Gill, fund board chairman.
DeVincentis said he approached the Educational Excellence Commission in the spring with the idea of hiring an additional teacher, but at that time, the class sizes were 21, 22 and 23 students in the third grade at Strawberry Park, and educational excellence commission members did not feel an additional teacher was necessary.
But with the addition of more students than projected at the school, the educational excellence commission supported the addition of three aides not to exceed the cost of $40,000.

Board fights for offender-program funds
Tuesday, March 16, 2004
Proposed cuts in state-funded programs to help youth offenders could do more harm than good, financially and socially, officials say.
The cuts could mean more youths are put in jail, more money is spent on juvenile detention facilities, and dangerous youths are released to the community without surveillance. Kelly Weimer, Senate Bill 94 coordinator for the 14th Judicial District, and District Judge Michael O'Hara expressed concern about the cuts to Routt County commissioners Tuesday. Representatives from probation and human services echoed those concerns.
Programs outlined by Senate Bill 94, passed in 1991 to keep youths out of expensive detention facilities, could face drastic changes if the Joint Budget Committee succeeds in decreasing the program budget from $9 million to $3 million.
"This is going to cause the elimination of the most basic services in our area," Weimer said. "We're pretty much down to case management, and that's it."
The program serves the 20 percent of juvenile offenders who are the highest risk and most dangerous, O'Hara said. With proposed cuts, the number served would decrease by 90 percent.
Routt County commissioners agreed the cuts would be detrimental and said they would write the state and encourage that cuts not be made. County commissioners said they would emphasize that the cuts would cause more costs because more detention facilities would be needed.
In the 14th Judicial District, funds are divided among Routt, Moffat and Grand counties; last year, the district received $84,000. Counties fund their own Community Evaluation Teams, which each has a case manager.
The teams work with young offenders before they are sentenced to help keep them out of jail, if possible, and pay for services such as monitoring, drug testing and psychological evaluations.
The teams, which include representatives from schools, human services, attorneys, mental health and probation, then give the ruling judge a recommendation on how each youth would be punished most effectively.
"I think time has shown that it works better than locking children up," O'Hara said. "This whole program was set up to avoid the huge expenses of building new juvenile detention facilities."
Between 20 and 40 youths are served each year in the 14th Judicial District, Weimer said.
Since other rules and the size of detention facilities cap the number of children who can be put in jail, cuts to Senate Bill 94 programs could mean children are released to the community.
"These are the kids, again, that are going to be running around the community with no supervision if the beds are full," Weimer said.
If the entire program is left with only $3 million, O'Hara said he feared the 14th Judicial District would receive no funding, as all of the dollars would go to Denver and other high-density areas.

On the Market: Colorado Group adds design talent to staff
Sunday, May 16, 2010
On the Market
Steamboat Homefinder
Visit SteamboatHomefinder.com for more real estate news.
Colorado Group Realty has hired Jessica Leon-Guerrero to oversee design, art work and brand identity for the firm.
Leon-Guerrero has been a resident of Steamboat Springs since 2006 and is a graduate of the University of Arizona, with a bachelor of fine arts degree in editorial illustration and visual communications.
She has worked in advertising and design for a broad range of clients and most recently was a member of an award-winning in-house marketing team for one of Colorado’s top financial companies.
“We are pleased to be able to bring a design and art director of Jessica’s caliber to the CGR team,” owner Shelley Stanford said. “We are excited about integrating Jessica’s creativity and past experience into the CGR brand.”
Tormey says demand is outpacing local supply
Bruce Tormey, of Ski Town Realty, reports that he sees signs that Steamboat’s real state market is on the road to recovery, barring negative influence form the national economy.
Historical data shows that “supply peaked about a year ago and since then the number of properties on the market has fallen and the number of pending (under contract) properties has increased,” Tormey wrote in a recent blog entry. “The ratio now is about 5 percent and needs to be between 10 to 15 percent for the market to be stable.
“This movement can come very fast; look at the January 2008 jump with the Intrawest purchase. The fastest it will probably happen now is within four to five months and could take a year plus. Demand has been outpacing supply for a year now, and we are slowly digging ourselves out of inventory abundance. Our slow real estate recovery began a year ago and at this pace in one year from now market demand and supply will be at the price equilibrium point and prices will go up from there.
“The national market is on the mend and shouldn’t slow down the Steamboat Springs’ real estate recovery. It is possible that Steamboat will reach a price stable point by year-end but more likely it will be next spring. The chance of the market stagnating through 2011 is very small.”

I love pancake day!
It looks like Jake takes the day pretty seriously.
"One pixel can change everything."
Ooh very cool Brian.
I just had to change my settings over to view it, think I will stay on this one for today.
We are having pancakes later, with golden syrup. Mmm, pancakes, ha.
Great job...Jake is utterly adorable! Mmm Pancakes!! ( having a hard time not making a batch of pancakes LOL)
Ohhhh, I get it. Today is International Women's Day. I thought this was some sexist statement how women should just shut up and stay in the kitchen making fluffy buttermilk pancakes. My bad.
Party on, Wayne.
"You've been here before, but things are about to change. I know it. I feel it. There's a storm on the way." -- Stephen King
Great....now I'm a HUNGRY!
Thankee kindly, Brian. Lots of yum for the tum. Jake be special!
Shrove Tuesday is a term used in English-speaking countries, especially the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,[1] New Zealand, Philippines, and parts of the United States[2] for the day preceding Ash Wednesday, the first day of the season of fasting and prayer called Lent.

Can we trust Labour with fiscal policy for the town?
9:17am Thursday 3rd May 2012 in News By Reader letter
Is there no penalty when politicians publish dubious information to tempt or frighten sections of the electorate into voting for them?
I cite the recent ‘Labour literature’ which states that a family earning £20,000 per annum loses £450 per annum because of the 2.5 per cent increase in VAT.
Simple mental arithmetic shows that they would have to spend £18,450 on 20 per cent VAT items, leaving only £1,550, which would just cover electric and gas, with nothing left to spend on food, rates, etc.
Can we really trust people with such arithmetical ability to run a tight fiscal policy for our town?

Requirements for Shelf-ready Packaging
Retailers look for packaging that is simple and easy to open without a knife, demonstrates a high degree of shelf impact and is easy to dispose of once empty.
I. Right size
Optimised packaging format in terms of logistics, module dimensions and unit count for most effective sell-through.
II. Simple product identification and visibility
The information on the shelf-ready packaging must allow the POS staff to identify where the product belongs quickly and easily.
III. Simple to open
The packaging must be easy to open at the POS yet be robust enough to survive intact the entire logistics chain from manufacturer to retailer.
IV. Simple placement and restocking
Retailers look for shelf packaging that makes it possible to stock and restock the entire shipment of goods onto the shelves in one step.
V. Simple purchasing / quick orientation
Shelf placement and packaging design help consumers find the goods they desire more quickly.
VI. Simple disposal / return
Lowest possible material consumption for the shelf packaging. Ideally with use of durable transport containers.
Studies by the
ECR Europe
have shown that many common causes for out-of-stock rates at the POS are related to the last 50 meters:
- Inefficient shelf stocking
- Poor identification of goods
- Difficult-to-open external cartons
Shelf Ready Packaging (SRP) is a suitable solution for those problems.
SRP evolved from the basic requirements for disposable transit packaging as recommended by GS1 Germany:
- Protecting goods against damages
- Modularity in the logistics chain
- Marketing and sales-oriented requirements
- Consideration of product and manufacturer liability issues
- Process considerations for transport, warehousing and picking
- Adherence to packaging ordinances
- Consideration of cost aspects
SRP packaging also fulfils other so-called functional requirements. SRP represents a more effective application of resources than the exclusive use of disposable transit packaging:
- Lower out-of-stock rates at the POS
- Attractive product presentation
- Easier purchasing process for customers
- Increased planned and spontaneous purchases
- Increase in revenues

Thomas Boston
BOSTON, THOMAS
(1676–1732)
Scottish theologian
Born in Berwickshire, Boston graduated at Edinburgh in 1694 and thereafter taught school while he studied theology. He became minister of Ettrick in 1707. About 1700 he had discovered an old Puritan work entitled The Marrow of Modern Divinity, originally published by Edward Fisher in 1645. Quoting lengthy extracts from Reformed and Puritan writers (including Luther, Calvin, Beza, Goodwin, and Sibbes), the book made a great impression on Boston and on his preaching. Reprinted in 1718 with a preface by James Hogg of Carnock, it was condemned by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland because of its Arminian statements. For opposing that decision, Boston and eleven other “Marrow–Men” were formally admonished and rebuked, but no further action was taken against them. The controversy died down and did not revive even when Boston’s new edition of The Marrow with copious and learned notes was published in 1726, the outcome of four years’ work in the Ettrick manse. For Boston The Marrow cleared away certain problems that until then, he said, had prevented his offering the gospel freely and fully.
He was a faithful and conscientious pastor in his rural parishes as well as being a notable scholar. Thomas Boston’s other works included his Memoirs, Human Nature in Its Fourfold Estate (1720), and A View of the Covenant of Grace (1734). J. D. Douglas

St. John’s University and its surrounding community will host
St. Baldrick’s and Locks of Love’s benefit for children with cancer
on Thursday March 14, 2013 on its Queens and Staten Island campuses
at 1:45 p.m.
This year’s event will also be honoring a
child, Gabrielle, who has benefitted from the research of St.
Baldrick’s and is now cancer free. She, along with her family, will
be presented with a signed St. John’s basketball jersey from the
men’s and women’s teams in honor of her courageous battle.
Several St. John’s students and employees will
have their heads shaved in front of a crowd of their peers for St.
Baldrick’s including: University Provost Dr. Robert A.
Mangione, Head Men’s Lacrosse Coach Jason Miller,
Associate VP and Dean of Students Daniel Trujillo, Associate
Director of Development Rino Grzinic, and Administrative Assistant
(Pharmaceutical Sciences) Suzette Weiss, among
others. In addition, Professor of
Management Dr. Andrea Licari will cut off approximately
eight inches for “Locks of Love.”
Participants are
asked to raise money for childhood cancer research with 100% of the
proceeds going directly to the St. Baldrick’s Foundation, and as
part of the effort, donating participants are asked to shave their
heads in solidarity with the children who suffer from cancer. Along
with this wonderful event, contributors also can participate in
Locks of Love, a non-for-profit organization, that donates “locks”
(hair 10 inches or longer) to be used to make wigs for children
suffering from hair-loss diseases.
For media inquiries, please contact the Office
of Media Relations at St. John’s University, by calling (718)

. “I always like to start with the stones,” said designer Brandi Hagen, ASID, of Eminent Interior Design of Golden Valley, MN, who collaborated on the project with architect Taunya Nelson, AIA, ASID, of Vujovich, Inc. of Minneapolis, MN, a residential design/build firm. “You can always choose the paint colors later, and there are always fabrics and custom vanities. You need to start with the stone so that you are not so limited.”
According to Hagen, the first material she discovered was a Pistachio onyx slab, which was employed for the vanity tops with an eased edge. “I fell in love with it,” she said, adding that the stone was also used in 6- x 6-inch tiles for a strip through the shower. “It just made sense. It’s gorgeous.”
The designer explained that the color of the onyx is what first caught her eye. “I felt like the onyx really pulled off the Asian look,” said Hagen. “I really wanted all the attention to go there, and keep the other stones more simple.”
In terms of flooring, Golden Sienna Patika travertine was used in “wet zones” where stone needed to serve a practical purpose. “We built up the tub deck and steps in the tub as well as the shower and outside shower area,” she said. “We really wanted a warm bathroom feel. The travertine is subtler [than the onyx]. We wanted something with a lot of movement, and we needed depth. The porous nature of the travertine really played off the onyx.” “Chrysalis Award for Remodeling Excellence: Best Bath Remodel Over $50,000” to honor the firm for its work on the project.

Can you find any Dickel where you are? Or is your Dickel coming up short? I think we all know how uncomfortable that can be.
I spoke to Gene Song, brand manager at Diageo for Dickel and Bulleit. He said the shortage of Dickel No. 8 has not abated. They're still waiting for whiskey to be ready. surprising part is that it is not export-driven. Dickel is sold only in the USA.
So, any Dickel sightings where you are?

Suu Kyi urges Indian support in democracy push
NEW DELHI (AFP) - Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi urged the people of India to help her country achieve democracy as she paid a landmark visit to New Delhi on Wednesday.
"We have not yet achieved the goal of democracy and we are still trying and we hope that ... the people of India will stand by us and walk by us as we proceed along the path that they were able to proceed down many years before us," said Ms Suu Kyi on her first visit in 25 years to Myanmar's giant neighbour.

For starters, Dave Bell came to the pages of Street Rodder through the attention of Tex Smith (SR founder along with Tom McMullen). We were doing Street Chopper at the time and Smith decided it was time to do a hot rod, or street rod if you wish, magazine-it would be called Street Rod (more on that in a later editorial). Smith thought it would be cool to have a monthly cartoon that catered to hot rodders but more importantly it had to have current topics to keep rodders thoroughly interested. Smith told me he was aware of a young rodder (in his '30s and to me that was old!) that just might be what our fledgling title needed.
His artwork was first rate; it was humorous and entertaining but once you got past the initial chuckle you began to notice all of the subtitles that made his work standout. He was a hot rodder and sure as heck knew what was going on-both in front and behind the scenes.
I remember looking at the first Henry HiRise and being totally fascinated. At first the sheer volume of the multiple topics handled in the art was mind boggling. It took me a while but I finally "learned" how to look at Dave's artwork-in small bits. I learned that you had to look at his work as a book broken into many chapters. To try and absorb it all at once meant you would miss many of the subtitles or in some cases the point of the entire piece. Over time I learned to start in the middle and work my way out realizing there were many topics worthy of my attention. His artwork was always humorous but often times I learned a surprising amount about what was going on in our hobby and I worked in it daily. The manner in which he drew the cars was distinctive but so was the way he handled the many upon many of rodders who likeness appeared in Henry HiRise over the years.
I can't even begin to tell you how many car types (builders, owners, and promoters) would call or write and see if I could put in a good word for them with Dave. My response was always the same, "Next month's cartoon will be as much a surprise to me as it will be to you!" Dave would call from time to time, he wasn't much on emails, and we would talk. Every now and then he would ask for a picture or two on a car that he had heard about but hadn't seen nor could find a photo. He would take this input and file it away for a future Henry HiRise.
I would always ask Dave, "Will this be in this month's cartoon?" He would always respond, "We will see." And we did. We were never disappointed. I can't begin to tell you how many times I would look at his monthly effort and try and find his phone number which he cleverly hid from month to month. Every now and then it wouldn't be in the cartoon and I would ask Dave where it was. He would respond thinking I was nuts saying, "Brian, it isn't can't you see that?" Oh well.
I always knew Dave was special as his first hot rod was a Model A coupe. (We Model A champions have to stick together against the Dark Side that's absorbed with the '32 thingy!)
Smith and I were emailing each other (as he lives in Australia) upon Dave's passing and he commented that he hoped Dave wasn't underappreciated. All of us know that it's oftentimes when you no longer have something that you finally fully appreciate what you have lost. I always thought that I appreciated Dave's efforts but I am afraid I am going to really feel the loss after a few issues of SR go by. I will miss a good friend. There's no one who can replace Dave nor would we want to. A glorious lifetime with a noteworthy career is now over- for the kid from southern Minnesota it's the end of an era. SRM

TALK ASIA
Interview with Ratan Tata
Aired April 13, 2011 - 06:32:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, ANCHOR (voice-over): It's a surname synonymous with business in India. Almost everywhere you look you can see the name that has become one of the country's biggest conglomerate companies. It's humble beginning in 1868, the Tata Company has been responsible for India's first steel plant, first luxury hotel and first domestic airline. Since then, it continues to pioneer different markets and made a name for itself around the world. The man currently at the helm of this growing business empire with $67 billion in revenue last year is Ratan Tata, the great grandson of the company's founder. He's further globalized operation and secured some big named international acquisition including Jaguar, Land Rover and Hetley Tea. But unlike many other Indian business power houses, the Tata is feared, but majority owned by its chairman. Ratan Tata holds just 1 percent of the company while more than 66 percent is controlled by Trust, a charitable organizations that support a wide range of educational and cultural institutions across India. This week on TALK ASIA, we're in Mumbai where a rare interview with the media shy never married business baron as he opened up about succession, the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks and share some very surprising stories about his private life. (END VIDEOTAPE) SIDNER: You and your family have a fascinating history. What is it about the Tata family that has brought so much success in a country of more than a billion people? RATAN TATA, CHAIRMAN, TATA GROUP: Well, I guess, success is to be judge by others, but I think the one thing the family has done is that it created a lot of industries in the early days prior to independence, which were national industries infrastructure in the form of power, steel, et cetera. And then gave also with the way in philanthropic grants and that's been something that's been carried on by their successors through peers. SIDNER: And you're one of the successors - TATA: And I'm one of the successors, but I've done very little compared to what they did. SIDNER: You really believed that? You've grown the Tata conglomerate 12 fold? TATA: Yes, but - you know, they - they did much more sort of earth breaking and missionary things, which today is a different - more difficult to do something that's really out in time. But I've tried to do whatever I could and I have I think more importantly tried to do - unfolding values and the ethics that they've set. SIDNER: Your company - you have about 98 companies in your conglomerate, 395,000 employees across the world. TATA: Yes. SIDNER: You've bought Hetley Tea, Core Steel, Jaguar, Land Rover, how do you keep up with all of these? TATA: I would say that I'm blessed with a very - very good executive team that - that operates reasonably autonomously each of the companies. We have a review. SIDNER: Where do you get the strength and the stamina to deal with all these different entities that you have to make sure do well? People are looking at you. They're watching you. TATA: I think that's the excitement of the job. That's been part of the adrenalin that gives you. SIDNER: Are you an adrenalin junky? TATA: No. SIDNER: But you like a little bit of kick? TATA: Yes, I do. Yes. One needs it once in the way and one needs to be able to get away from it also. SIDNER: I've been in India for just three years so I'm a new be, but if you ask the average Indian about corruption, they will complain to you that it touches their lives every day. Do you think in order to do business here that you have to play this game, give tip, kickbacks, bribe? TATA: No, we have succeeded in growing in the manner we have without in fact partaking in this. We have also been -- I would say that we could have grown faster and could have prospered more as a group. But we have never - we have never in fact partake in this kind of activity. SIDNER: There have been things sad recently because of this bandwidths scandal. TATA: Yes. SIDNER: About you, about one of the Tata companies. Did you - anyone in your company or any lobbyist for the company do anything inappropriate or illegal? TATA: I could say with my hand to my heart that we have not in fact partake in any - like (Kleinstein) activity. I am hopeful that the investigations that are underway will - will truthfully bring out the position and that the truth will be on the table before - before too long. SIDNER: When it comes to corruption, do you think the government has been doing the right thing? Have they done what needs to be done? TATA: I think what's happening now - in terms of things being before the court say I hope will put things in the right perspective. I hope that it doesn't become a nation of scandals and allegations as they are. I think more importantly, the media has to be more circumspect and be careful that they malign or allege or convict people before they have had a fair trial. SIDNER: Is it hard to be an honest businessman in India? TATA: I think there are many honest businessmen. There are many that have been and happy that I have not been (inaudible) dishonest because I have not been. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SIDNER (voice-over): Coming up, we get a guided tour of Ratan Tata's rebuilt Taj Hotel. The scene of Mumbai's terror attacks in 2008. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SIDNER: This close to an - 16 hours, 20 hours later - UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All in all it was just a horrible event that I never thought we would ever see in India. (END VIDEO CLIP) SIDNER: This hotel has a special place in a lot of people's hearts after what happened in 2008. I was standing just - just outside with a lot of other journalist from around the world. TATA: Yes. SIDNER: Listening to the sound of grenades. Listening to the gun fire, seeing the fire, what was your first thought? How did you find out about what was happening inside this hotel? TATA: Somebody called my home and said that there were shootings here. I called the exchange in obviously, but there is no reply. So - I was also outside that first night and - I knew quite fast that it would - the police came and said it was a gang war. And it became quite clear with grenades and automatic gunfire that it was not and then it became clear that we were under some kind of attack not necessarily - that we were under terrorists attack not where they came from or who they were. That picture emerged the next day. SIDNER: During that 60 hours or so, what were you doing? What were your frustrations? TATA: We're not allowed to enter here because it was taken over by the commandos. So - actually it was a difficult time because the next day I thought it was all over because there were low periods. The first night was - and then the commandos came in and I issued a press statement basically saying that, you know, this would break us down. But then it went on for two more - two more days or three more days. SIDNER: You were able and gracious enough, you spoke with our Fareed Zakaria - TATA: Yes. SIDNER: During that time and you said some things to him about law enforcement. You were very upset. TATA: Yes. SIDNER: Have things change any since then? TATA: I don't know enough to answer that honestly. It's not - one thing I do know is they're better equipped today than they were then in terms of arms and in terms of logistics, et cetera. But training is an important part of being prepared and being trained to deal with these - these situations is an important part of total preparedness and I don't know whether that is happening or not. And I have no way to know. I hope - I hope I don't need another way to know. SIDNER: Do you have any regrets either from before, the days before the attacks happened? Do you have any regrets about how you or your company handled it? TATA: No, I feel very proud of the way the staff dealt with the situation. To me, it has meant more than anything else because if you were a group of independent people, some waiters, some chefs, some porters, all of whom put their own lives, you know, after that of the guests and the well being of the guests and - And in many cases lost their lives to - to the bullets of these terrorists, but succeeded in - in serving their - their guests with pride and a great cause to themselves. SIDNER: How much time, effort and money has it taken to restore this since the attack? TATA: It took over a year because we had to rebuild some of the floors. We have to go through most of the structure because of water damage through the fire department. And we really did more to undertake a renovation that presumably skin deep. So we really did a total renovation and ironically a few years after we had renovated this whole wing. SIDNER: It must been heart breaking to see what has happened to your hotel? TATA: It was. We're very lucky that it wasn't more. There's a great pride in the place and - and in some ways I'm glad we re-did this plot better than what it was. That the other places like the restaurants, et cetera, walled and repaired this differently so you don't walk into restaurant and say, I remember it's different. SIDNER: I have to say, I remembered the scene from the security cameras. TATA: Yes. This is the same. It hasn't been changed and our intention was to rebuild it the same way. I mean, the rooms are better that what they were and the restaurants are different. They are - they don't give you the sense of nostalgia. SIDNER: Both (inaudible) though - do you ever hear from your guests that it also gives them a bit of sadness just knowing what happened? TATA: Yes. We do have some very grateful for how they survived in the - were supported in those hours of crisis. Muslims were sad that what happened, happened and - SIDNER: Are you proud of this? I mean, the restoration is impeccable? TATA: I am proud of what they did and really proud to have been a part of - of the hotel as it was in the spirit that existed. The day we reopened, this whole staircase was full of employees. The whole staircase was employees (inaudible) shouting with great spirit on - on the fact that we were reopening again. SIDNER: This is a difficult question. This is one of the ones that my mother would be a little worried about me asking. TATA: Yes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SIDNER: Your family has been likened to the Rockefeller's in America. Do you think you would have been as successful has you not been born into this dynasty? TATA: I think there are similarities in the sense the Rockefeller's had given so much to - to the United States and done so much for the poor segments and done so much for the arts and - and the sciences. That there are great in similarities in terms of what we believe we should support. The - the early Rockefellers made their wealth from being in certain businesses and - and remained personally very wealthy. Tata's were different in the sense the future generations were not so wealthy. They - they were involved in the business, but most of the family wealth is put into trust and the family did not in fact enjoy enormous wealth. SIDNER: I have to ask you this and I know you've been asked this a million times. TATA: Yes. SIDNER: Who will succeed you? Because you have no heir and a lot of people are used to companies especially family-run companies in India having the heir take over the company? TATA: There's a committee that's been established. That committee is mandated with looking at internal candidates, external candidates, Indian expatriates and they have a short list of people that they're examining today and meeting. And I've stayed away from that committee because I think that committee should operate independently without the force of someone who is looking over their shoulder and I hope that by first of half of this year, we'll be able to define a suitable candidate with whom one can overlap a short period of time before I move away. SIDNER: What are the chances that that person does not have the last name Tata? TATA: See I'd have to say that that's something I wouldn't like to comment on. My stepbrothers, one of the - one of the candidates that is being considered and I don't think it's my lot to say whether - it's 50 percent, 90 percent or 10 percent so - SIDNER: Will that cost them the strife? Do you guys talk about this? TATA: No, I don't think - it may - I have no way to know. SIDNER: What do you want your legacy to be? How do you want to be remembered? TATA: What I would like to do is to leave behind a sustainable entity of a set of companies that operate in an exemplary manner in terms of ethics, values and continue what our ancestors left behind. Not my legacy alone, but a continuation of the legacy that extends through the last over 100 years and I hope my successor will - will be as committed to that as I have tried to be. My only regret is that I am not 20 years younger because I think India's going through very exciting period in its history. SIDNER: This is a difficult question. This is one of the ones that my mother would be a little worried about me asking. Have you even been in love? TATA: Yes. SIDNER: How many times? TATA: Seriously, four times. SIDNER: Can you tell us anything about that? TATA: Well, you know, one that was probably the most serious was when I was - working in the U.S. and the only reason we didn't get married was when I came back to India and she was to follow me and that was the year of the - if you might - the Indo-Chinese conflict. And in true American fashion this conflict in the Himalayas and the snowy uninhabited part of the Himalayas was seen in the United States as a major war between India and China. And so she didn't come and finally got married in the U.S. thereafter. SIDNER: So now I have to ask you since you did bring up the word married. TATA: Yes. SIDNER: Why have you never gotten married? TATA: I - when you ask whether - love - I came seriously close to getting married four times and each time, it got close to the air and I guess, I backed up in fear or one reason or another. Each of the occasions was different. But in the hindsight, when I looked at the people involved maybe it wasn't a bad thing that I - I did it. I think it may have been more complex had the marriage taken place. SIDNER: Were any of the people that you were in love with here or are they still here in the city? TATA: Yes. SIDNER: Yes? TATA: Yes. SIDNER: You're being very coy. Are you going to tell us? TATA: Well, certainly - because of the people that are in here and of course, this may be aired in the U.S. so I'll be in trouble with whatever I do. So I think I better stop here. SIDNER: OK, thank you so much. TATA: Thank you. END

Nelson-based fishing company Sealord has been fined $63,400 and ordered to pay reparations of $12,500 after a fisherman fell through a hatch, rupturing his spleen.
On October 2 last year, factory hand James Billingham was helping prepare Sealord vessel Ocean Dawn to sail from Nelson. While trying to remove bungs under the hatch cover, he overbalanced and fell five metres into the ship's hold.
He was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with a sprained thumb. Later that day he suffered severe abdominal pain and returned to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery to remove his spleen.
In September Sealord pleaded guilty to one Health and Safety in Employment Act charge of failing to ensure the safety of an employee. Nelson District Court Judge Tony Zohrab said Sealord had failed to take all practicable steps to ensure the safety of employees on board.
Maritime New Zealand director Keith Manch said the sentence sent a clear message to operators that health and safety," he said.

A woman raped by the adult son she adopted out as a child has asked the courts to reveal his name, even though it could identify her.
The 29-year-old man, who was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison on Tuesday, was convicted of assaulting and raping his biological mother some months after he tracked her down to ask questions about his parentage last year.
But rather than multiple rapes, he was convicted on nine counts of incest after the jury found the sexual relationship they embarked on was consensual to begin with..
His adoptive mother made a plea to the court, saying her son was ''a good man'', and naming him would serve no purpose.
She said there was some self-interest attached.
''I don't want to see our good name out there.'' But she also said family members would be affected.
Judge Claire Ryan adjourned the request for permanent suppression so more information on the effect on the convicted man's mental state could be presented.
The man's trial in Auckland District Court in May was harrowing. Jurors were shown evidence, and the woman broke down repeatedly giving her testimony, and at times ran from the court.
She said she was ''doing what she was told to do'', which included ''performing like a porn star''.
Adopted family squared off against biological family, with the man's adoptive mother telling the court the woman had told her the relationship was consensual. The jury did not accept the woman was being forced, and found the man guilty of incest rather than rape.
While he was found guilty of one representative charge of rape later in their relationship, he was found not guilty of all the specific-incident rape charges and other representative sex charges.
The defence has indicated it will appeal on the inconsistency of the verdicts.
The violence charges included kicking and punching the woman in the face.
Judge Ryan said the woman remained in fear of her son and still suffered from flashbacks. She said both parties were vulnerable - the son from distress about his heritage, and the woman from guilt over adopting him out.
''Unfortunately these were matters you resolved by entering into a relationship.''

We’d just opened our mouths to ask whether JVC planned to offer a ‘proper’ hard-drive Everio as opposed to the Microdrive-equipped MC-series when it thrust just such a device into our gaping maw.
Sore of mouth but warm of heart, we saw that this new Everio had a 30GB hard drive – good for seven hours of footage on the highest quality setting. The GZ-MG50 is the most senior of a family of three, sharing a bed with two 800k-pixel-sensor siblings: one 20GB and one 30GB.
For a number of reasons other than gadget lust, we deemed this range-topper to be the one to choose. As well as the larger drive, and the 1.3megapixel sensor, it also has an F1.2 lens, which voraciously sucks in light to provide decent pictures, even in murky shooting conditions.
The MGs all use MPEG-2 compression that, while not as economical as MP4, provides a good mating of image quality and file size. And though seven hours of continuous shooting might not sound like a technological revolution, it’s seven times more than a MiniDV tape.
We were worried that the hard disk would be slow to start up and store images but, in practice, recording begins almost instantly, and start-up takes a manageable six seconds.
The Everio uses a standard 1.8-inch hard drive, so it’s blessedly light and compact compared to DVD or MiniDV camcorders, and a special sensor automatically shuts down the device if you drop it.

In October 2012 the letters “S.O.S.” were carved into the ground of Western Sahara/Algeria near the Saharaui refugee camp Smara in collaboration with Artifariti and the Frente Polisario. The graffiti measures 5 km x 1,7 km, which makes it the largest graffiti in the world. The piece refers to the Saharaui peoples struggle for independence from Moroccan rule in the almost forgotten West Saharan conflict.

The filter foam is impregnated with highly active carbon powder, granulate or pellets. This impregnation of the open-cell filter foam with carbon increases the effective surface to a maximum whilst maintaining the volume. Approx. 80 - 100 grammes of activated carbon are impregnated per millimetre of material thickness and square metre of foam. The carbon achieves a surface of approx. 1.300 m² per gramme. In addition, the open-cell structure of the filter foam reduces the differential pressure to a minimum. This achieves the best possible air circulation and thus utilization of the carbon powder at a minimum of energy. Typical fields of application are air filtration and water filtration. Poret® -Carbon is available in rolls, sheets, cuttings, stamp parts.

Umm, all fine and good, but how do you generate the key table in the first
place? I don't want the keys on the main document, I want them on the

#1: Changing sessions is like changing profiles: sessions contain the complete state of the editor (open files and their modifications, as well as open windows and their positions), and changing session will close all open files and switch entirely to the new one. This would work behind the scenes just like 'File/Exit and preserve session': state, such as unsaved changes to open files, would be saved in the session.
#2: Sessions apply to a window at a time only. Opening a new session will open a new window with that session. It allows multiple sessions to be open at the same time, but perhaps doesn't make sense if you want one session to span multiple windows.
#3: Making sessions a bit 'softer': Opening a session closes all opened but un-modified files, while leaving modified files alone. Files that were open in the session are then opened. Window state, layout, find history etc aren't touched.
I feel safe using sublime text, I know my stuff is always going to be there! lol

October 19, 2012 (BENTIU) - Thousands expired commodities have been confiscated according to Unity Authorities finance Ministry, and traders from Ethiopia and Sudan being investigated for selling the goods after their sell-by-date.
Niemeri Mayual Garkek, the Unity State director for industry and quality promotion, told Sudan Tribune on Friday that the expired goods are being stored by the government after they were found on sale in Bentiu’s markets.
The expired goods are allowed to enter the state as there asre "no clear check points" to inspect imported commodities”, Garkek said.
South Sudan depends on imported goods from the neighboring countries Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. The country has vast areas of fertile land but insecurity and inefficiency in agricultural production mean that South Sudan still depends largely on imports, especially for manufactured goods.
Garkek says over reliance on imports is a big challenge for the young nation, making Unity State "a zoo of the expired commodities".
The expired commodities came through Rubkotna and Guit ports on the White Nile river which are used by traders to import goods to the state. Most storage facilities for consumable goods are not well ventilated resulting in some goods going bad even before their expiry dates.
The expired goods include medicine, maize flour, alcoholic drinks, powered juices, biscuits, and sodas. Authorities say will take to court traders suspected of bringing expired goods into the state.
“Before the demolition in that place we have apply what is so call legal procedures, in the present of legal advisor at the Ministry level or even there is no legal advisor we use to cooperate with those prosecution and attorney or legal administration, the legal procedure we have to use we do with what we call not comply form”, Garkek added.
Garkek says the government is working hard to stop such practices from reoccurring within the state, adding that traders should respect the role of the South Sudan National Bureau of Standards.
In the state capital Bentiu, consumers complain that many bakers sell bread with insects inside their bread and that rotten goods are sold in markets.
Joseph Gatluak Jal, 21, a bread seller in Kalibalek Market told Sudan Tribune that some goods are rotten when they are sold to them by wholesalers.
“It is true that some wheat flour carry some insects", he said, adding that "when we go and buy the wheat flour we could not know whether such wheat flour has spoiled”.
Jal who has made his living selling bread seller since 2007 earns between 15 to 20 South Sudanese Pounds (SSP) a day. He blames the government for not properly controlling imports and the consequent potential health consequences.
South Sudan lacks the equipment or laboratories to properly examine the import goods to the country.

But static as his situation may seem on the surface, Barden points to a different outlook going into his second pro season.
"There's plenty of things that are different," Barden says on a recent August night following his second training camp practice of the day. "Last year was more of an introduction; this year is more of a fine-tuning experience.
"Whereas I've had a year to learn and grow and watch and now I'm starting to apply some of the things I was able to observe into my own game and try and grow and earn the confidence of the coaches and our quarterbacks."
Barden appeared in just three games, sparingly, at that, and finished with one catch on the 2009 season. Never having been given the chance to really succeed or fail on the field, there would appear to be an air of curiosity even within the Giants surrounding his 2010 potential, but also a strong vote of confidence.
"Last year he didn't get a whole lot of playing time, when he did get in he made some things happen," Giants quarterback Eli Manning told reporters in comments reprinted on the team's website. "But he had a really good spring, he's a smart guy, he understands the offense and what's going on, especially for a guy who hasn't had much playing experience. So it'll be good to get him in the preseason games and other games and see how he does. But he's a big target with big hands and he's excited about what he can do and how he can help improve our offense."
Generally speaking, Barden's minimal involvement in the offense last season isn't really uncommon for a first-year wide receiver, but expectations were probably inflated somewhat by his draft position – he was taken as the 85th overall pick in April 2009 and signed a four-year, $2.48 million contract that June – and the Giants' apparent need for depth at receiver at the time.
Add to that Barden's NFL-ready build -- one that many compared to former star wideout Plaxico Burress, whom the Giants had lost to a two-year prison sentence earlier that year -- and the aptitude he showed at minicamps and training camp coming on the heels of a breakout senior year at Cal Poly and it wasn't implausible to think that Barden might see the field sooner rather than later.
But he wasn't included in the receivers rotation to begin the season, a season that the team opened on a tear with five straight wins.
And, while the Giants eventually faded, losing eight of their last 11 to finish 8-8 and miss the playoffs, it was a good year for Giants receivers, with Steve Smith putting up career numbers (107 catches for 1,220 yards and seven touchdowns) and Mario Manningham (822 receiving yards) starting out hot before being supplanted by Hakeem Nicks, who tied for the lead among NFL rookies in 2009 with 790 yards receiving.
"I really don't like to make excuses for myself, saying it's a numbers game and things like that," Barden says. "I imagine that played a part in it, but at the end of the day, I control my own destiny and if I wasn't on the field, I guess I didn't do enough. The whole idea is to use that as motivation and do more.
"The main thing is gonna be taking advantage of opportunities when they come — get a play here, get a play there, make a play — those are things that build credit, so to speak, and show my value. The more I can do that, the more encouraged the coaches will be to give me more roles and more opportunities."
For Barden, the conclusion of the Giants' 2009 season was frustrating on more than one level.
Powerless to alter the Giant's monumental collapse from his position on the sideline, it was hard for him not to get restless.
"Whether you're winning or losing, you're always gonna feel like you could be out there doing something productive to help the team," Barden says.
And, while Barden will likely always remember his first catch, a 16-yard reception in the season finale at Minnesota on Jan. 3, the setting, a 44-7 blowout loss, is one no one on the team cares to recall.
"We feel like we had a very talented group last year and we came up short in several areas," Barden says. "We're looking to seize the opportunity this season and jump on our competition from the get-go and not let up. [We want] to be a dominating team, be a physical team and get back to Giant football."

Although Carbon's economy managed to post employment gains in July, the county experienced a climbing jobless rate last month.
The latest data compiled by the Utah Department of Workforce Services indicate Carbon's unemployment rate increased to 4.6 percent last month from the 4.5 percent level reported in June 2008.
By comparison, Carbon's unemployment rate measured at 3.6 percent in July 2007.
On the positive side of the economic spectrum, Carbon County posted a 1.6 percent employment expansion rate, with the local labor force totalling 9,242 last month and 9,097 in July 2007.
At the state level, Utah's non-farm wage and salaried job growth for July 2008, as compared against July 2007, is estimated at 0.6 percent. This is lower than last month's 0.9 percent and represents more downward movement in Utah's employment picture.
Approximately 7,300 jobs have been created in the Utah economy within the past year, raising total wage and salary employment to 1,250,100.
Utah's second primary indicator of labor market conditions - the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate - jumped to 3.5 percent in July. Last July, the state's rate was 2.7 percent.
Approximately 48,900 Utahns were considered unemployed in July compared to 37,000 last year.
At the national level, the United States unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent in July, exceeding last year's nationwide jobless level by one full percentage point.
"The housing construction picture keeps getting worse and it really has no chance of improving until next year at the earliest. Even next year carries its own questions," commented Mark Knold, department of workforce services economist. "Is Utah in a recession? Probably a psychological recession, given rising energy and food prices plus an onslaught of negative media highlights. But Utah's remaining industries taken together don't support a recession. In fact, if we removed the construction industry from the picture, Utah's employment growth rate across the remaining industries is almost 2 percent."
"Online job listings are down a bit for July, but not significantly," pointed out the DWS economist. "The health care industry continues to aggressively expand employment and I recently attended a meeting composed of information technology and life science human resource personnel who bemoaned the lack of engineers and other available technicians. They would hire workers and expand if they could find willing and available labor. We also observe that, even in slow economic times, there are still vast amounts of churning and job changing that occur. Job opportunities still present themselves."
The education and health care sectors added approximately 6,500 employment opportunities in the last 12 months.
Health care accounted for the majority of the job growth, expanding employment by nearly 6 percent. Health care responds to population growth and demographic change and can breeze through slowing economic times with minimal or no adverse impact, indicated Knold.
Education is a second industry somewhat immune to the ups and downs of the economic cycle.
At the kindergarten to 12th grade level, the sector is almost completely immune to economic impacts.
Utah's surging elementary age population drives up the demand for additional teachers. As the student population climbs to higher grade levels, teaching employment expands statewide.
"We also observe that slower economies put more demand upon higher education. When job access and opportunities slow, many working-age adults choose to return to the education system as a means of riding out a slow economy and furthering their knowledge and skill base, thus increasing their attractiveness for future employment," noted Knold.
Industries like life sciences, information technology and computer software remained fairly vibrant in July. Life sciences encompass biotechnology, medical devices, research and development, pharmaceuticals and most areas related to the environment.
Occupations in the sector demand specialized education or training.
Energy or natural resources represents another robust area in Utah, particularly oil and natural gas development in the Uintah Basin, Carbon and Duchesne counties.
Coal is also a major player in the central Utah economy, but mining activity has slowed. However, few alternatives to coal currently exist and mining remains a key part of America's energy matrix.
Several industries are struggling in Utah.
Construction remains the most visible and the picture continues to darken. The industry follows a pattern of low employment in winter and peak labor force numbers in summer. But last December's construction employment exceeded the July level employment.
The situation does not appear poised to reverse, pointed out the DWS economist. With changed mortgage rates and borrowing requirements, home prices are overvalued and unaffordable for many Utahns. It will take time for the adjustments needed to correct the imbalance.
In addition, all activities in the finance industry have scaled back and the sector has shed 800 jobs statewide on a year-over-year basis. Most national analysts continue seeing banking and finance struggling to maintain solvency.
Utah's manufacturing environment is also succumbing to the national downturn. On a year-over basis, the industry added 200 jobs statewide, but has been trending downward all year, and is expected to soon move to the negative side of the ledger, maybe as soon as next month.

In looking towards the immediate city and county general elections on Nov. 3, the Carbon County Chamber of Commerce board of directors would like to invite all voters to participate in a "Meet the Candidates" nights scheduled for Oct. 26 at the Helper City Rio Theatre located at 210 South Main Street in Helper from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Session one begins at 5:30 p.m. and runs until 5:50 p.m. and is for candidates running for Price City, mayor and city council. In attendance will be Joe Piccolo, who is running for mayor, and Jeanne McEvoy for city council. Both candidates are running unopposed but have been invited to participate so that Price City residents have an opportunity to ask questions of their candidates. Kathy Hanna-Smith is also running unopposed for city council but is unable to participate due to several prior commitments.
Session two starts at 6 p.m. and runs until 6:20 p.m. for all candidates running for Wellington City mayor and city council. Those who chose to participate are mayoral candidate Ed Chavez and city council candidate Amber Adair.
Session three begins at 6:30 p.m. and ends at 7 p.m. This session will be for both candidates vying for a position on the Price River Water Improvement District board, including incumbent Keith Cox and opposing candidate Tom Matthews.
Session four will run from 7:10 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. and will include all eight candidates from Helper City. Contenders for mayor are Dean Armstrong and Kirk Mascaro. Competing for the four year city council spots are Gary Harwood, Orlando Ochoa and Chris Pugliese. For the two year city council, candidates included that evening are Robert Bradley, Donald Mortensen and Brandon Wise..
A meet the candidates night for Sunnyside and East Carbon was also scheduled on another evening but due to lack of participation by all but one candidate from Sunnyside, it has been cancelled.
"The Chamber's goal is to introduce the candidates to citizens in order to find out what their platform and goals are so that voters can make an informed decision on Nov. 3," said Chamber executive director Ann Evans. "There are no other elections where local citizens' votes count more or where they can be more involved than in city, county and state appointments. We want everyone to be part of the process."

I always use this recipe when making chocolate chip cookies because they turn out every single time for me. The cookies stay chewy and thick and the best part is that you can basically add anything you want to them.
This makes about 8 dozen:
This makes about 8 dozen:
Pudding Cookies
Ingredients:
( like chocolate/butterscotch/peanut butter/white chocolate chips, candy bars, m&m's, nuts, etc.)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir together flour and baking soda in seperate bowl and set aside; in a large bowl, cream butter, brown and white sugar. Beat in pudding mix until well blended. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. When smooth, slowly add in the flour mixture. This can take a little while, but make sure it's well incorporated into mix.
Finally, add the "fillers". This time I split the dough in half and used chopped up snickers bars in one:
And a combination of butterscotch and chocolate chips in the other:
I use my small melon ball scoop to make 1 " balls so the cookies are all uniform in size and bake evenly. When using the snickers, make sure you smooth the balls or the snickers part will ooze all over your pan.
Line your cookie sheets with parchment paper and bake for 8-12 minutes or until golden. I like mine slightly underdone, just a tiny bit golden.
These are just the perfect size and keep so nice all week long, if they last that long! I store them in ice cream gallon containers. So good!

Can you use the sugar free instant pudding in this, or does it need to be the regular kind?
Wendy, good question. I've never tried the sugar-free(because sugar-free products do some not-so-good things to my body!) but I don't see why it wouldn't work.
I am on a quest for "the perfect, no-fail chocolate chip cookie recipe." I'm beginning to think it doesn't exist...

Thanks for sharing the recipe.
Our little hamster Sofie says hello to Sophie.
OMG! it s sooo good! my kids and my fiance love it!! I cant wait to do all your recipes :P
Yum! These cookies are to die for! I've been looking for a great cookie recipe and this one is a winner. They are even better the second day! TFS!!!
Beautiful,darling dog and to die for cookies? What else does a person need in life? Well, maybe a little self control. I would probably hug on that sweet thing way too much and I know I would eat too many of those cookies. Thanks for the recipe. Just what I need for Christmas. I am going to put Kumquat zest in some of them.
Hi Tanya, I blogged about the pudding cookies on todays post. I cant wait to see your new little guy. Here is the link.
Mommy's Kitchen:
I found your blog and recipe from 2peas. I had this recipe a long, long time ago and in a move I think my handwritten recipe book fell into the garbage my mistake. :( I've been able to replace all the recipes I wanted EXCEPT this one. Now I have it! I made the recipe a bit ago and have cookies baking in the oven. You truly can not know how happy I was when I tasted that first cookie and told my husband, "THIS IS IT! THIS IS THE RECIPE I LOST!" Thank you, thank you, from the bottom of my heart!
Just made my first batch and they are so good. This is the first time I've ever made chocolate chip cookies from scratch. We used mini chocolate chips and health bar toffee bits. I am going to have to freeze some of these or I am going to be in trouble. Thanks for the recipe <3
just got finished making them!.. i liked them but i added a bit of salt to them after the first batch came outta the oven (:
i just made these tonight but gluten free! they were incredible! i halved the recipe and substituted the flour for 1 cup brown rice flour, 1 1/4 cups potato starch and added 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum to the flour mixture. everything else i kept the same and they were perfect. chewy and delicious. thanks for the great recipe!
My grandma passed away 20 years ago and always put pudding in her cookies. I am smiling so much today remembering and am so glad you shared this.
These look DELICIOUS. This may be a silly question, but does "t" mean tablespoon or teaspooon?
Well, I made these tonight.... I 'made SURE' I had all the ingredients prior to us heading to Walmart, so I could pick up anything needed..... Thought I had a bag of Flour at home just in a ziploc.... when I started pouring it into my flour container, it ended up being pancake mix... UGH! I needed 1 more cup of flour.... Soooo.... Some quick thinking, I found some instant oats, measured out a cup and away I went to my Magic Bullet.... 10 seconds later, a nice flour like powder was ready to mix in with the rest of the flour.... I haven't ever made these, so I'm not sure if they taste any different.... but they're delicious either way! :)
I am working on my Masters Degree in Speech Language Pathology, and am doing an Internship at a hospital, I plan to take some in to my co-workers for our pot-luck tomorrow :).
Thanks for posting! Even if it was in 2008! :)
I make something like this, but I usually add butterscotch pudding to my cookie mix, then add white chocolate chips, so I flavor the batter and the white chips stand out a bit more.
Saw this on Pinterest and had to come to read the instructions. I'll be trying this - I usually make my chocolate chip cookies into bars by using a jelly roll pan, so we'll see if they work that way. And Heath Bar bits would be AWESOME in here! :)
Ive been using this recipe for years! Its truely THE BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe EVER! I get asked to make these all the time, I like the idea of using different types of bits! Ill try chopped snickers next! Thanks for sharing
Found you on Pinterest...these look awesome! Can anyone tell me how many cookies this makes (I use a regular sized cookie scoop). This looks perfect - I love thick and fluffy cookies.
hello there....I had these at a friends house the other day when she made them!!! OMG they are the BEST EVER!!! LOVE them.
I have a ? can you freeze some of the batter so I don't have to make so many at once?? I'm making them tonight but would love to know so I can always have them on hand to throw in the oven.
Thanks for the post!!! :)
I made these tonight and they were wonderful! I've been looking for a great chocolate chip cookie recipe and I've finally found one. I only made half a batch, and I used one cup semi-sweet chocolate and one cup walnuts, and they were divine. The only thing I noticed is that they were a little too thick and dome-like for my taste, so I flattened them just a bit with the bottom of a glass before baking. I also used an insulated cookie sheet and baked for the full 12 minutes. Using a 1-1/2 inch scoop, 1/2 batch made 36 cookies. Thanks so much for sharing!
Just made these and they were delicious. Thank you for sharing your recipe! I'm thinking of adding chocolate pudding the next time I make them and see how that tastes. Mmmmm!
I made these this past weekend! I divided the batter and did half Reese's Pieces/oat and half toffee bits/pecan. Made closer to 10 dozen, oh darn!
I found this recipe/your blog from Pinterest about a month ago and I have made these 4 times...I have some in the oven right now! Thanks for sharing! Love them!
Delicious!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. They came out so soft and chewy with just the right amount of crisp on the edges!
I halved the recipe and made them gluten free, for the flour I subbed: 2C rice flour + cornstarch (put 1Tbs cornstarch in 1 cup measure and fill the rest with rice flour for each cup) and 1/4 C tapioca flour and 1 tsp Xanthan gum.
Sooooo Good! :D
What brand/type of butter has everyone used for these cookies?
call me silly, do you mix the pudding as it says on the box or just put the powder mix in?
Love reading your comments on these. I'm actually making 16 dozen right now for a fundraiser! I use unsalted butter. You just pour the powder of the pudding in the mix and make sure it's instant! I've tried so many different combos and they are wonderful. Our favorites are regular CC, white chocolate/cranberry, and reese's peanut butter cup. Thanks again everyone!
I made this recipe exactly and yeah, they do look good and taste pretty good, but I think the recipe needs salt. Also, put them in an airtight container as soon as they are done cooling. I left some out for a day and they are hard as rocks.
Anonymous-I must disagree. I've never added salt and everyone RAVES about these. Also, I've accidentally left these out overnight and they have never hardened on me....not sure why yours did!
Also-you use instant pudding mix, just out of the box. As for butter brand, I use whatever is on sale, salted or unsalted.
This will be my third time making these cookies and everyone LOVES them! Our favorite thing to do is freeze a portion of them and then we just grab one out of the freezer and let it thaw on the counter for a few minutes. They are delish!
Just wanted to let you know that the Fabulous Sin City Rollergirls LOVE your recipe. I made these yesterday and brought a gallon ziploc bag full of them to practice with me...they were gone in like two minutes.
Do you have this recipe for 1 dozen. I absolutely do not want to make 4 dozen for only my husband and I!! LoL! We do not need that many cookies!!!!
So is that really two 3.4 ounce packages of pudding mix? The biggest package I have is a 1.5 ounce.
I just made these... and they were good... but they didn't look anything like yours? they were dense and they didn't spread at all while they were baking. wondering what I did wrong??
Hi Tanya,
I just re-pinned these on Pinterest and can't wait to try them out. I have be seeing pudding cookies everywhere lately. I would love to invite you to share these on my Creative Thursday Link Party at. Have a great week.
Michelle
These look amazing!! I can't wait to try them. Does t. Stand for tablespoon or teaspoon??
t.= teaspoon
T.= tablespoon
Just got done making these and they are awesome. Best Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe EVER!! Will definitely be making these again, and again and again. Thanks so much for sharing.
hi
sorry to ask but they look amazing and im in england so i dont know what instant punnding is or where i can get it, are there any substitutes?
thanks
ani.
If you happen to check this, Ani - we get instant pudding in small boxes at the grocery store. The box is probably 2x4 inches, and it contains a package full of a sugary powder. Usually you mix it with milk and refrigerate to make pudding. I have no idea where you would get it in England, but perhaps check the bigger grocery stores there?
I just made these and they are delicious! For the first batch, I just dropped them on the cookie sheet and they didn't spread out much but the second batch I flattened them out a bit and they look much better.
Will definitely keep this recipe.
Thanks!
Loved these! Made these tonight and halved the recipe. Made 17 Large cookies (used 2" overfilled scoop). I flattened them slightly before baking. They were fantastic right out of the oven as well as cooled. Great recipe, Thanks!
Rez
I didn't have vanilla pudding, so I used chocolate. This was wonderful. Sinfully delicious.
Just made these tonight and they turned out yummy. I halved the recipe because I didn't need 8 dz cookies and it worked fine. I also had to flatten them out a bit before baking because the first batch didn't spread much. I am thinking I will try making these with chocolate pudding next, for an extra chocolate "kick". :) I bet they will be delicious! Thanks for the recipe!
This chocolate cookie recipe is the best! The only exception that I made was to add a teaspoon of salt. Also, I added a couple flakes of sea salt to the top and they were great. I brought them into my high school students and they raved about them. From now on this will be my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe! Thanks so much for the post.
I made these cookies last year for Christmas and I was super impressed with how easy and how awesome they turned out! Gathering ingredients to make this year's batches!!?
So id like to make these its 4 cups of whatever that's kind of alot is that right? :D
Just looking on your blog AGAIN for the recipe since this is my fourth time making them and I can't live without them. :) You should know that when I click the link from Pinterest, it comes up and says that it is a suspicious link, and your blog may link to spam or inappropriate content. Just an FYI! :) Thank you, thank you for our new family favorite!
Hi! These are AMAZING! I tried a combination if white chocolate chips and crushed peppermint - quite the hit at work! I want to try making a chocolate cookie - do you think it would work if I just use chocolate pudding instead of vanilla?
How many cookies do these make??

The president is wrong to support Gay marriage. His whole argument is based on false information....
« Back to Article
Mr. Seaman, great letter, couldn't agree with your more. The problem in this country is that movies have gays in them so kids think it is a normal lifestyle when it is not. What a shame that in the future when my son has children, they will not know what is normal or if they should have two parents who are female, or two parents who are male, or if they are truly dating a female or a male or has that person had surgery. It is becoming a sickk society to say the least.

So? Belief has nothing to do with truth and proof. I believe we all got to Planet X after we die. You see, the problem with your failed logic is your assumption you know what happens after we die. You don't. What happens if God is pro-gay and doesn't appreciate anti-gay sentiment? You may be on your way to the lakes of fires.

"Evolution is one. While everything evolves, we just don't have scientific proof that we came from monkey's and apes."
Wrong. We have overwhelming proof we evolved from primates, including DNA, our molecular makeup, etc. etc. Of course Christians will do anything to refute this because it shows the Bible is a myth. Science also proves that people don't rise from the dead, the Earth is @ 4.5 billion years old, snakes can't talk, virgins can't get pregnant from space gods, and on and on and on...).
So, while science is important and certainly has it's place, it's not fail proof.

There is a huge difference between 'reporting' what went on at the time and what was being condoned. Likewise, you've got to realize that there were three kinds of laws given in the Bible; moral, ceremonial and civil. The latter two were fulfilled with Jesus' crucifixion and Resurrection, the moral laws were not. Eating shellfish was a Ceremonial law. Homosexuality is a Moral law.

Hi mike.. despite our differences of opinion regarding politics and religion, I'd be willing to wager that you're are good citizen, husband and father. My hope for you and your family would be that you do not create a bias against science for your kids. It is through the window of science that we continue to learn more about who we are, where we've come from and the wondrous innermost workings of our planet and our universe. Religious teachings sometimes work in opposition to the awe and the truths revealed through learning and understanding. I would hope that you find a way, if that paradox exists, to find a way to make it work. That is my hope for you..

Mike, there is the problem. I want my kids to be happy and healthy. If they find their way to a religion that gives them peace and strength, that is a bonus. To that end I would err on the side of being open and allowing them to come to me rather than me voicing my opposition to their choice. They know full well what you believe and how you feel. You don't have to reinforce it.

MUNCY - A newly-formed Muncy Borough Council, being made complete with the addition of a new member named Tuesday, will be mulling a fire tax.
Borough council unanimously agreed accepting Muncy native Jonathan Ort as one of its own, which will be official when he's sworn in by Mayor Edward Dannemann later this week.
Ort's appointment is needed to fill the remaining nine months of former Councilwoman Virginia Gardner's term.
A 1994 graduate of Muncy High School, Ort lives on Quarry Road.
He has a business administration degree from Pennsylvania College of Technology, and is employed as a salesman for Cysco Central Pennsylvania Food Service.
One of the matters he likely will be voting on in the coming weeks includes the implementation of a fire tax.
Council President Elaine McAleer described the fire tax as a borough tool in case its implementation ever be needed.
"It's just to put it on the books, it does not mean we're enacting it," McAleer said of the tax. "When council does the budget next year or councils after us, it's there for them."
Council instructed borough solicitor Wilfred Knecht to draft tax details expected to be considered soon.
Keystone Hook & Ladder fire Chief Jamie Brelsford said his department's merger with the Muncy Creek fire department is reaching a monumental occurrence Saturday, when the joined forces will begin referring to themselves as members of the Muncy Area Vol. Fire Co.
"We will be (together) as a new entity as of this weekend," said Brelsford, who will be deputy chief of the new department, which will continue to form.
Scott Delany will be fire chief.
Charlie Lockart, local insurance professional, said there will be substantial savings for fire department workers' compensation.
Instead of the insurance premium being based on a limited population in the borough, he said savings will occur from combining it with the township area.
Councilwoman Linda Stein said two grants are being put to use for community improvement.
She said residents will be meeting this week for downtown site masterplanning recommendations.
Stein said the other grant will be instrumental in ensuring streets and sidewalks are safe as traffic changes with the influx of industrial trucks traveling through.
In other business, council:
Agreed upon the borough's zoning hearing board to serve as the appeals authority on local storm water management.
Agreed upon the borough removing snow and ice when it accumulates at least 2 inches on the streets or when it's obviously considered plowable.
Agreed to wait until May 3 for its next regular meeting, allowing state Rep. Garth Everett, R-Muncy, to speak on Chesapeake Bay Watershed issues, April 21 at a 7 p.m. public meeting at the local high school.

HAMPDEN — There was no history of domestic violence problems at the home that Katherine Hunt and her killer, Lawrence Beaute, had shared since July of last year before last week’s murder-suicide, according to police.
“We’ve never been involved with either of them,” Hampden police Chief Joe Rogers said Monday.
He also said that to his knowledge, no protection order had been put into place, adding that even if Hunt had obtained a protection order from another community, Hampden police would have received a copy.
On Monday, the series of events that led to last Friday’s shootings on Marina Road remained unclear.
Hunt was a welder at General Electric in Bangor and Beaute was a medical technician at the Maine Veterans Home, also in Bangor.
Hunt reportedly was in the process of breaking up with Beaute when he shot her with a 9 mm handgun early Friday morning in the kitchen of Hunt’s home, where he had been living since moving to Maine from Jacksonville, Fla., Maine State Police spokesman Stephen McCausland said Friday.
Beaute then used the gun to kill himself, McCausland said, adding that state police detectives are calling Hunt’s death a domestic violence homicide.
According to detectives, Hunt left work early Friday morning to return home and likely was shot a short time after she arrived at the house. Beaute called the Maine State Police dispatch center in Orono at 7 a.m. to say there had been a homicide at the house and that he intended to kill himself.
The two bodies were found on the kitchen floor by the state police tactical team when they entered the two-story house at noontime. The bodies later were taken to the State Medical Examiner’s Office in Augusta for examination.
The deaths shocked many residents of Hampden.
Though neighbors said they heard the couple arguing earlier this year, both Hunt and Beaute “seemed happy” and were friendly, often waving at people passing by on their way to Turtle Head Marina, a popular boat launch facility on the Penobscot River.
The incident also caused a six-hour standoff that closed two miles of Main Road North, forcing several business to temporarily close until the matter was resolved.
On Monday, Rogers said while much remains unknown about the circumstances leading to the shootings, he recommended that anyone who believes they may be heading into a tense, emotional or otherwise stressful situation not do so alone.
“Bring someone with you. It doesn’t have to be a police officer, but don’t go alone,” he said.
McCausland said last week that Hunt’s death was the ninth homicide so far this year and not the first attributed to domestic violence.

Interest in Buying Property in France Surges
Interest in Buying Property in France Surges as Pound v Euro Exchange Rate Reaches Four Year High.
This week saw the pound strengthen further against the euro and reach a high not seen since October 2008.
(PRWEB) July 18, 2012
This week saw the pound strengthen further against the euro and reach a high not seen since October 2008.
£1.00 will currently buy around €1.274 which is a significant increase if you are thinking of buying property in France.
As an example, if you have a budget of £250,000 you would have had €282,500 to spend in Autumn 2008 while you would now have a healthy €318,500. At the higher end of the market some recent clients of ours with £800,000 to spend on a property in France were over €115,000 better off than they would have been four years ago. This additional purchasing power enabled them to trade up in terms of location which also helps long term investment value.
Allied to this there are still many excellent deals to be had in the French mortgage market. You can currently get a variable rate from 2.8% with an 80% maximum loan to value. 20 year term, fixed rate French mortgages are available from 3.3%, again with an 80% maximum loan to value ratio. Indeed a maximum loan to value of 90% is available - this can include estate agent’s fees but not Notaire’s fees.
As an approximate guide, your current monthly outgoings (including the monthly repayment on your new French mortgage) should not exceed one third of your gross monthly income. A percentage of any rental income you receive on your house in France can be considered.
Trevor Leggett, Managing Director of Leggett Immobilier, comments:
"We have seen a significant rise in sales of French property this year to UK buyers wishing to take advantage of the surge in value created by the strengthening pound. Recent research from BNP Paribas showed that property in France is seen as something of a safe haven in these turbulent times, indeed 97% of respondents said that they saw the long term investment potential for houses in France as very good. We have a listing of over 7,000 houses for sale throughout France and we firmly believe that there are still plenty of bargains to be had. We have seen particularly strong activity at the higher end of the market with prestige property proving especially popular, we have excellent teams in the Alps and on the Riviera, both of which are traditional destinations for UK buyers.
Last year Leggett Immobilier saw our sales increase by around a third throughout France and, thanks to the excellent exchange rate and availability of some terrific mortgage deals, this year we are certainly heading for more of the same"..

US Virgin Islands Real Esate and Economics News
All Reverse Mortgage Company becomes only active lender offering reverse mortgages in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Garden Grove, CA (PRWEB) August 24, 2012
The U.S. Virgin Islands will now have dedicated access to reverse mortgages, now that Garden Grove, Calif.-based lender All Reverse Mortgage Company has expanded its business to the U.S. territory.
All Reverse Mortgage Company is the only lender actively offering the federally-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program to consumers in the Virgin Islands.
"We had a flurry of activity in the territory, so we started looking into getting licensed and found that no one was serving the area," said Michael Branson, CEO of All Reverse Mortgage Company.
The company serves the St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John areas of the region.
While the overall market may be small relative to the U.S., All Reverse Mortgage Company still sees value in expanding into the region.

Byrd-Bennett approved as CPS CEO
By Lauren FitzPatrick Staff Reporter lfitzpatrick@suntimes.com October 24, 2012 6:06PM
At the Chicago Public School monthly board meeting, the new CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett made her first appearance. Council members looked at budget matters and more. | Al Podgorski~Chicago Sun-Times
Article Extras
Updated: November 26, 2012 6:52AM
The Chicago school board voted unanimously Wednesday to approve the hiring of Barbara Byrd-Bennett as new Chicago Public Schools chief at $250,000 annually for three years.
Byrd-Bennett, the fifth CPS chief since 2008, will earn the same base pay as her predecessor, Jean-Claude Brizard, who departed recently after only 17 months on the job.
She’ll also be paid $30,000 in “relocation and transition expenses,” and her contract will contain “terms for compensation and benefits,” according to the resolution passed unanimously by Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s handpicked school board.
Byrd-Bennett’s contract is still being finalized and won’t be available for weeks, CPS spokeswoman Robyn Ziegler said.
Byrd-Bennett was welcomed by Chicago Board of Education President David Vitale, who invited her to say a few words at the meeting’s start. She jumped right into her presentation honoring two schools that won a national Blue Ribbon.
Vitale cut her off: “That’s what I like about Barbara. We always get immediately down to work,” he said.
She took the hint to tell the room: “I am a teacher who happens to be the CEO.” She promised to restore trust in the wake of the district’s first strike in 25 years and to work transparently with staff and the community.
CPS expects a $1 billion deficit by summer; the nation’s third-largest district will announce which schools it seeks to close by Dec. 1.
The board also approved the new three-year Chicago Teachers Union contract.
The atmosphere overall at the new CEO’s first board meeting was markedly more conciliatory than it had been in the months before Chicago’s teachers went out on strike. Byrd-Bennett committed to setting meetings with several of the community groups that brought gripes to the floor to figure out solutions. Union and community leaders pleaded with her to seek public input before announcing which schools could close.
“I’m hoping that as we move forward on something like this it’s going to be done in a participatory and transparent manner with not only the [Chicago Teachers Union] but the public involved in what’s going on here,” CTU recording secretary Michael Brunson said.
For the first time, anyone who wants to register for two minutes’ floor time before the board can do so online at cpsboe.org starting Nov. 5 instead of lining up outside CPS headquarters early in the morning before each monthly board meeting.
More public input on the district’s amended budget also is coming, and a vote is set for the next meeting on Nov. 14. Hearings are scheduled for Nov. 5, though locations have not yet been announced.

MADISON, Wis. — Tyler Griffey sported a bandage over his left eye for a nasty cut that required stitches after he bumped heads with Traevon Jackson early in the game.
Tracy Abrams took a break early in the second half after running into a screen from Mike Bruesewitz.
Those injuries weren’t serious, but after the 74-51 tsunami No. 12 Illinois endured Saturday at Wisconsin, we’ll see if the psychological wounds are.
After the Illini’s worst loss on his watch, first-year coach John Groce indicated that he’ll look hard at rewarding players who hustle with more minutes — and sit those who don’t.
‘‘Everything’s open at this point,’’ Groce said. ‘‘The thing that was most disappointing to me was, at the end of the day, [the Badgers’] competitive spirit was better than ours. That’s unacceptable. That’s not what we’re about.’’
The Illini (14-4, 1-3 Big Ten) know the best thing they can do is forget about this miserable trip and go back to work. Most of all, they can’t slip into the tentative mind-set that greased their 2-12 skid at the end of last season.
Senior captain D.J. Richardson, who scored 12 of his team-high 16 points in the second half, said he’s confident the Illini won’t fall into another rut.
‘‘I’ve been here in these situations before,’’ Richardson said. ‘‘I’m a senior. I can’t let the season go wrong. We have to bounce back. It starts with the seniors and leaders, not just talking but by example. I have to yell, and then I have to go out on the court and do it.’’
Richardson singled out Mike Shaw, a 6-8 sophomore from De La Salle, as someone who took his yelling to heart. Shaw had two points and three rebounds in 19 hustling minutes, and Groce noticed.
‘‘One guy that played his butt off was Mike Shaw,’’ Groce said. ‘‘Mike Shaw played like his head was held under water. That’s what I’m looking for.’’
An increased role for Shaw likely would come at the expense of Griffey, who is valued for his shooting but scored only two points on 1-for-6 shooting.
Griffey wasn’t alone. Targeted by Wisconsin’s defense, Illini star Brandon Paul (eight points on 1-for-11 shooting) had fewer than three baskets for the first time this season.
Illinois’ 51 points were 10 fewer than its previous scoring low in a 68-61 loss at Purdue. The Illini, who had only two assists, also had a season low for points in a half. They trailed 39-19 after a miserable first half.
Wisconsin (12-4, 3-0) led 14-0 at the start, 27-7 eight minutes before halftime and 54-26 with 14:25 to play.
‘‘That’s the best we’ve played all year,’’ Badgers coach Bo Ryan told Groce when they saw each other outside the interview room.
The Illini not only lost, they made the Badgers, who shot 38 percent in their first two Big Ten games, look like a scoring machine.
Wisconsin shot 49 percent and hit 10 three-pointers, three more than in its first two league games combined.
This was only the second time Groce believed his team had been outhustled, and that’s two too many for him.
‘‘You can say, ‘That’s 16-for-18,’ ’’ Groce said. ‘‘I don’t think that way. We should have that all the time. Execution stuff, we can work on. But it’s unacceptable not to be physically and mentally tough. It’s unacceptable not to play with passion and energy.’’

Charity 4Children’s recent survey has made an alarming discovery: one fifth of Britain’s mothers and fathers are convinced that drinking doesn’t negatively affect their parenting. In fact, these people claim drinking make them better parents.
Of those parents who participated in the survey, seven percent admitted to drinking everyday but only nine percent of them are aware of its negative effect on their children, or on their family life.
One in five parents, on the other hand, believes that drinking has a positive impact on their parenting skills, as referred to in a recent report by the Mail Online.
This shocking revelation has prompted charity 4Children to call for a major public information campaign. It is their aim to educate parents about the negative impact of their drinking on their children.
Mark Bennett, Director of policy at 4Children, is believed to have claimed that the findings back up the belief that many British parents view drinking alcohol “as normal as drinking tea".
He said, as quoted by the Mail Online: “Part of the problem is people don't realise that they are causing problems by drinking to excess habitually.
“It could first be one glass, which leads to another. If parents have had a bottle of wine or more, their ability to react to their child, especially a small child, will be impaired.”

Erosion research at iconic St Paul’s shows benefit of declining pollution levels
A cleaner, greener future? St Paul's Cathedral, London
One of London’s most iconic buildings, St Paul’s Cathedral, is safer from pollution eroding its limestone façade than it has been since it was built 300 years ago, according to scientists – but it might turn green in the future.
The team, including Dr Cherith Moses, Senior Lecturer in physical geography at the University of Sussex, conducted the longest-ever study of erosion rates on a single building and found that sulphur dioxide levels – responsible for acid rain – have fallen by 95 per cent over 30 years.
The drop is largely due to a decrease in industry and power generation in central London and the capital increasingly moving to cleaner energy.
Acid rain is now responsible for a fraction of one per cent of the damage to St Paul’s and the rate of erosion at the cathedral is now dominated by natural rainfall, which is a weak carbonic acid with a pH of about 5.6.
The researchers conclude that the building is now safer than it has ever been, having survived the ravages of the Industrial Revolution, the nearby Bankside Power Station’s plumes of sulphuric dioxide gas and smoke, and Londoners’ love of coal fires.
Scientists from Sussex, Portsmouth, Oxford and Cambridge monitored the rate of erosion on the balustrade between 1980 and 2010 using a Micro Erosion Meter to take periodic readings of pollutants in the natural stone.
The findings are published in the journal Atmospheric Environment. They found atmospheric sulphur dioxide concentrations fell from a daily average of 80ppb in the early 1980s to less than 3ppb by the late 2000s.
The researchers are now looking to see if natural organisms that might no longer be retarded by pollution or aggressive erosion could in future colonise natural stone buildings like St Paul’s and pose a new erosion risk.
Dr Moses, who is an expert in limestone weathering processes and products, says: “With predicted changes in rainfall linked to climate change, our research findings make it even more important for us to understand whether microflora, including algae, lichens and microorganisms, erode or protect stone surfaces.
“Natural stone buildings, under predicted wetter conditions, may be become ‘greener’ in the future because of microfloral colonisation. Our research will continue to investigate this over the next ten year measurement period.”
The cathedral was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and completed in 1710 and the balustrade was added, against Wren’s wishes, in 1718.
Dr Robert Inkpen (University of Portsmouth), who led the research, says: “We were surprised that the results were so compelling – the drop in erosion over 30 years is quite dramatic and the data clearly illustrates erosion rates have now fallen to levels you would expected with just natural rainfall.”
The unique dataset collected by the scientists may provide more effective predictions for building conservation projects – and provide valuable analyses of other major natural stone buildings. In addition to St Paul’s, the British Museum, the east side of Buckingham Palace, the Bank of England and many of London’s monuments are built from Portland limestone, as are some of the country’s other cathedrals.
The research team began their study a year before the closure of Bankside Power Station in 1981. It had been generating electricity for 29 years emitting carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide. The year it opened, in 1952, pollution across the city was commonplace and London’s ‘great smog’ of that year saw thousands die due to pollution.
The research team measured five sites inside the balustrade, including those facing north, south, east and west. The west-facing site, directly exposed to the pollution plume from the now defunct power station, showed the most erosion.
Dr Inkpen said: “London is probably the largest exposed outcrop of Portland limestone in the world. Wren chose it to build St Paul’s and others followed his lead.”
The researchers have continued studying erosion and surface change rates at the cathedral and will report their next findings in 2020.

Philadelphia First City to Offer Green Biz Tax Incentives
12/04/2009
SustainableBusiness.com News
The City Council of Philadelphia on Thursday voted to give tax breaks to businesses that pass the B Corp Rating System for sustainability.
Philadelphia is the first city in the country to adopt a financial incentive for sustainable businesses.
For tax years 2012 through 2017, 25 eligible businesses will receive a tax credit of $4,000 to be used against the gross receipts portion of the Business Privilege Tax.
Companies can be classified as certified sustainable businesses once they are certified as B Corporations ().
The B Corp Rating System was created by the non-profit organization B Lab to promote "a new type of corporation which uses the power of business to solve social and environmental problems."
To date, B Lab has certified 240 companies in 28 US states.
B Lab says it only certifies companies that go beyond "good marketing" to truly embrace good corporate values that include the interests of employees, community and the environment.
Some statistics on certified B Corps:

Our story begins several weeks ago, when a certain soon-to-be 26-year-old shyly placed his order for a certain very special birthday cake. The birthday boy was none other than my friend Eitan, he who occasionally wields imaginary pistols and shoots them off Wild West style at the dinner table, who, in the eighth grade, composed a heart-rending (and rhyme-tastic) song chronicling the sorry fate of "a baker who lived in a village, who went by the name of Mr. Concillage," he who repeatedly insists, "you really don't need to bake me a birthday cake," but with a hopeful smile and a mischievous gleam in his eye adds, "but if you do, can it have whipped cream?" and with that seals the deal.
It took some prodding, dear readers, but soon Eitan's request was on the table: something cold, moist, and custardy, with a generous helping of strawberries. Eitan, his wife, Julia, Eli, and I were in the midst of an after-dinner flop on our green sofas. Our bellies were full, but our brains soldiered on to consider just what this luscious-sounding cake might look like. The word "trifle" was tossed around, fingers were pointed at the strawberry-crowned cover of April's Gourmet magazine, and soon even Julia had come to terms with the idea of a dream birthday cake conspicuously lacking in chocolate.
After more Google searching than I'd like to admit, and a careful patching together of several promising recipes, I had my game plan. On Thursday night, I prepared the custard, and on Friday morning, I baked and split the cake layers, macerated the strawberries, whipped the cream and, hands literally atremble with excitement, put the whole, whopping thing together.
So far, so good.
Eli left work early so that he could assemble his contribution to the birthday dinner, something specially suited to Eitan's penchant for Mexican cuisine: a saucy, steaming bed of bean and cheese enchiladas. The thought of making our way over to Eitan and Julia's with both the enchiladas and a towering four-layer cake in tow tortured me with waking nightmares of a whipped cream and bean-spattered sidewalk. But never fear, we had a plan: Eli would prepare the filling and the sauce for his enchiladas and then drive me over to Eitan and Julia's with the cake securely resting on my lap. Then, we would turn around, Eli would bake his enchiladas, and we would head back out, right on schedule.
Given the fact that the cake had not even threatened to crumble or tear when I delicately split two layers into four, and that our punctiliously timed baking, cooking, and delivering schedule had, thus far, gone off without a hitch, something was bound to go wrong. It was only fair.
When Eitan saw the cake, his eyes grew gratifyingly wide. Julia made room in the fridge while Eli and Eitan slid the four-layered beast from the wax paper-lined baking sheet to a glass pedestal. (I only shrieked a little during the perilous transfer. I am very brave.) Eitan ran for his camera, and after a brief photo shoot, Eli and I were back on the road. We jumped from the car, and then it hit us:
Eli: Do you have the keys?
Jess: No, you have the keys.
Eli: No, I don't.
Jess: Yes, you do. I was holding the cake, you grabbed the keys, locked the front door, and stuffed them into your pocket.
[Silence.]
Just how it came to be that our car keys and house keys were on two separate rings that evening is not all that interesting, so I'll spare you the details. But the clock was ticking, and there we were, unsure of how we were going to get into our building, let alone our apartment, bake the enchiladas, shower, and make it back to Eitan's birthday dinner on time. Finding our keys was also, ideally, a part of the plan.
We buzzed up to our neighbor Varina, and she let us in. I did such a good job, dear readers, of keeping my cool. I said not a word, rolled not an eyeball, and even smiled a little on our elevator ride up. (Though, I must admit, when Eli tried to give me a quick squeeze between the third and fourth floors, I quietly explained, "I'm not mad, but I don't want to hug you.") At Varina's place, Eli called Eitan and Julia, confirmed that they had our house keys, and sped off to retrieve them. Without missing a beat, I turned to Varina and shamelessly asked if I might shower. Varina extricated her cat from the tub, handed me a towel and, classy shower-lender that she is, even offered me a glass of wine. Good friends and neighbors are the best consolation at key-less times like these.
I leapt from the shower just as the front door of our apartment, one floor below, slammed shut. Still dripping, I hurriedly waved good-bye to Varina, flew down the stairs, and found Eli sliding the enchiladas into the oven. We arrived at Eitan and Julia's exactly 45-minutes late - not bad, all things considered.
Julia and Eitan were waiting for us, as were our friends Jonathan and Hila. When the six of us get together, hilarity always ensues. I mean, everyone-talking-at-once, howling-with-laughter hilarity. Last Friday night was no exception. Hila's account of a questionably sordid watch seller had us giggling in no time, especially the part about how, in a tense phone conversation with the perpetrator, she referred to Eli - my software developer husband - as her lawyer. From there, we moved on to crude hand gestures, enchilada sauce on the carpet, and some good old-fashioned marveling at our friendship and the luck that brought us together.
Finally, it was show time.
Eitan, despite it being his birthday, insisted that I do the honors. Smiling dopily, I cut the first slice. From the outside, the cake looked like a hulking puff of white, a few sliced strawberries perched almost comically atop the airy whipped cream. But the inside (oh the inside!) was an entirely different story. Four-layers, three pounds of strawberries, and a double recipe of custard different, to be exact. It was the most unbeautiful beautiful thing I have ever seen.
I ask you, has ugly ever looked so good?
I had worried that this cake would be cloyingly sweet, or that somehow or other the combination of cake, custard, berries, and cream would fall short. I need not have been concerned. Quieting the six of us is no easy task, but this cake left us in bliss-induced silence for at least a few gaping seconds. Then came the moaning, ("Ohhh... delicious...") the groaning, ("This cake is so rich!") and the scraping of the plates. Even Eli finished his slice, which is saying a lot. Jonathan decided against a second piece, but then went ahead and ate one anyway. There was finger licking, people. I was in heaven.
And, most importantly, Eitan got his cake, and ate it too. Happy birthday, friend.
Strawberry Custard Cassata Cake, or, Cleveland Cassata
Adapted from the Strawberry Chiffon Shortcake at Smitten Kitchen, and the Strawberry Cream Cake published in the June 1997 issue of Gourmet.
When Eitan first rattled off his list of ideal birthday cake qualities - cool, moist, custardy, and chock full of strawberries - a cake from my childhood in Cleveland immediately came to mind. Cassata cake. I began my research with a search for cassata cake recipes, but one after another they called for ricotta cheese instead of custard between the cake and strawberry layers. I was baffled. It was surely custard in the cakes that I remembered.
With a little more digging, I found that, while the majority of cassata cakes are indeed made with ricotta, Corbo's bakery in Cleveland has long produced a custard and strawberry cassata. Their Sicilian family recipe traces back 100 years. Apparently, this cake got the attention of Chef Mario Batali who, according to this site, said, "Corbo's Bakery has the best cassata I have tried in the USA." Other bakeries and supermarkets in the Cleveland area took their cues from Corbo's and made their cassatas with custard, too. To reproduce this Cleveland classic, I grabbed the cake from one recipe, the custard from another, and did my best to piece together a cassata the way I remember it.
Yes, this cake is a bit of a project in that it involves several components and takes some time to put together. But difficult it is not. To keep things manageable, you can make the custard and the cake the night before - it's best to refrigerate the cake before splitting the layers, anyway, to decrease the risk of breakage - and then just split the layers, macerate the berries, whip the cream, and assemble the next morning.
For the cake layers:
2 1/4 c. cake flour
1 1/4 and 1/4 cups sugar, divided
1 T. baking powder
1 t. salt
3/4 c. cold water
1/2 c. vegetable oil
1 t. lemon zest
1 t. vanilla extract
5 large egg yolks at room temperature
8 large egg whites at room temperature
1/2 t. cream of tartar
For the custard:
6 large egg yolks
1/2 c. sugar
2 c. half and half
3 T. cornstarch
For the macerated strawberries:
3 lb. strawberries
2 T. sugar
For the whipped cream:
2 c. chilled heavy cream
1 T. sugar
Make the custard: (you can do this step the night before)
Whisk together all of the custard ingredients in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-low heat, whisking constantly. Turn down the heat so that the mixture just simmers, and whisk until thick, 1-2 minutes. (The key words here are whisk constantly. The custard will tell you in no uncertain terms when it is done. It's like magic. One moment you can comfortably whisk your way through the liquid, and the next it is undeniably a thick custard. Cornstarch is neat like that.) Transfer the custard to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a round of wax paper, and cool. Then, chill custard, covered, for at least 3 hours, or up to 2 days.
Bake the cakes: (you can also do this step the night before)
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line the bottoms of two 9-inch round cake pans with lightly oiled (I use cooking spray) parchment paper . Otherwise, leave the pans ungreased.. (Here is a trick for making sure you have poured an equal amount of batter into each pan: Grab two toothpicks and stick one into the center of each batter-filled pan. Then, pull them out and see if the amounts of batter on the picks line up.). (I did end up pulling off a teeny tiny bit of the top of one layer, but it didn't matter, since the cake would ultimately be covered in whipped cream.)
Wrap the two cakes in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least three hours, or overnight.
Meanwhile, prepare the strawberries:
Slice the strawberries thinly (but not too thinly - you want the slices thick enough so that you can really taste and feel the berries even once they are smothered by custard, cake, and whipped cream!), and place in a bowl. Sprinkle with the 2T. sugar, and stir. Allow the strawberries to macerate for 1 hour. Their juices will release and pool at the bottom of the bowl. Every so often, give them a stir. Strain the berries, reserving the released juices.
When the cakes are thoroughly chilled, and thus a little sturdier, it's time to split them in two. Using a long serrated bread knife, carefully saw each layer in half. Place each layer on a wax paper-lined baking sheet or plate.
Whip the cream:
Whip the cream and sugar together until stiff.
Assemble the cake!
(I experimented with my layering technique: custard alone between the first and second layers, strawberries alone between the second and third layers, and strawberries and custard between the third an fourth layers. In the future, I'll put strawberries and custard between every layer.).
Using a spatula, cover the entire cake with whipped cream. Top with either leftover macerated strawberries, or a few "raw" strawberries. (Next time, I'll go with the latter.)
Chill the cake for at least 8 hours before serving, so that the cake has time to absorb the strawberry juices. Bring to cool room temperature before serving.
(To transfer the cake from the baking sheet to a cake stand, use the wax paper to gently scooch the cake from one surface to the other, then tear away the visible wax paper.)

such a funny story! i can never make layer cakes that don't topple...congrats!
omg! I live in Cleveland and I love Corbos cassata cake!! I'll only eat cassata with custard!! Thank you for sharing the recipe!
Hi, koshercamembert. I found these layers to be quite sturdy and just about topple-proof. I can't take any credit - it's just a darn good cake recipe!
And hello, Ellen. Thanks so much for your note. It's great to hear from a Clevelander! I'm a former Cleveland girl myself, and I'm thinking that it may be up to us (and Mario Batali, of course) to spread the custard cassata gospel!
The story is hilarious and well-written, but the cake looks sensational!
Thank you, Linda, for your kind words about both the writing and the cake!
Hi, looks like a great recipe, I'll probably try this one. I love your blog, I always pass by, you have beautiful pictures and yummy recipes :).
Hello Pam,
It means a lot knowing that you like what you see here enough to stop by every now and then. Thank you. This cake is definitely worth a try. Enjoy!
You totally made my day today! I love you blog! You bake and cook along the same lines as I do. I was actually looking for a cassata cake recipe because I love Corbo's and wanted to try and recreate it. I am way too excited to try this recipe. I hope you never stop posting recipes. Thank you so much for what you do!
Wow, Anonymous, now you're the one who has made my day. Thank you, and welcome to Sweet Amandine! As for posting recipes and stories, the pleasure is all mine. I'm thrilled that you plan on taking this recipe out for a spin. If you think of it, would you let me know how it goes? I would love to hear.
Wow,
I've been searching for this cake. I'm from Cleveland and Fazio's used to make this. I always had it on my birthday. Thank you. I'll make it this week.
Lisa
Hi, Lisa
Well, I can't promise that it will be exactly the same as a Cleveland cassata, but it is certainly "in the spirit of." I'm proud to say that this cake has gotten rave reviews around here, so hopefully it will do the trick for you, too. Happy baking! (And happy birthday, if that's what you'll be celebrating with this cake.) By the way, if you would like to try this cake with a lemony twist, take a look over here.
I made this for a dinner party recently... it was a tremendous hit! I, too, couldn't find a recipe for the right kind of cassata cake (the ones from my childhood were from Catalano's in Highland Heights)-- this was amazing.
The outside of the cassata cakes I remember were covered in sheets of white chocolate; I couldn't re-create that in my kitchen, so I just took a vegetable peeler to a white chocolate baking bar and covered the top of the cake with white chocolate curls.
Hillary - That's wonderful! You don't know how fun it is for me to know that someone out there baked this cake. And for a dinner party, no less! I'm so pleased to hear that it was a success. Thank you very, very much for reporting back.
The white chocolate shavings on top sound amazing. My mom grew up in Beachwood, and she also remembers white chocolate being involved in her cassatas. She would very much appreciate your addition.
If you ever want to try a lemony version of this cake, here's a recipe for you. My husband, Eli, actually prefers it over this cassata. I like them both.
Another Cleveland girl here. I'm thrilled to come across an ACTUAL recipe for cassata (the right way). I cheat on mine and use Thank You brand vanilla pudding and the yellow cake that requires butter (it seems to be more dense). Kudos to you for this and thanks for helping me prove to my facebook friends that this is indeed a real cake. You rock.
As a former Clevelander, I love this cake and plan to serve it at my wedding! I have been disappointed time and again away from Cleveland finding strawberry cream cakes with no custard inside. HOWEVER< I think you have forgotten an important flavor, though --I believe there is RUM EXTRACT in the Custard of my favorite version.
Anonymous and Anonymous - I love that this cake has all of you Clevelanders (and former-Clevelanders) coming out of the woodwork!
Anonymous #1, I can't believe that your friends ever doubted you. Sheesh.
Anonymous #2 - Oh! Your wedding guests are in for a treat. I love the idea of adding some rum to the custard. I'll definitely give that a try the next time around. Thanks!
I don't know if you follow The Pioneer Woman's cooking blog, but she's running a contest right now. You should sooo submit this (this is anon 1, btw). I linked this page on my fb to prove cassata is real and now have people across the country drooling in envy!
Oh my, Oh my!!! I'm not exactly a former Clevelander, I am from Lorain County, born anf raised!! I hade a cassada cake for my b-day for more years than I can remember.
I moved to AZ last spring and NO ONE here knows what a cassada cake is... My 16 year old son and husband even posted an ad on CraigsList trying to find a bakery that makes it in the Phoenix area - they actually had to describe it to a few local bakers, until one agreed to give it a shot. One came close but it wasn't like Ohio cassada cakes.
Now, we can show them this recipe for next time. Thank so much - it is nice seeing other people, especially from Ohio who love this cake..
Glad to know that Cleveland is being represented and well.
I'm on the other side of town in Maple Heights with Baraonas. We have been ordering cassata's from them for 20 years. They are the next best thing, when I don't have time to make them myself.
hey, thanks so much for posting that recipe!! My mom and I have been searching and searching for a good cassata cake recipe (one without ricotta, especially), and yours was a life saver. :) Thanks alot!
-"Elizabeth"
Anonymous #1 - Hello, again! I missed the Pioneer Woman contest, but it's prize enough for me knowing that I'm helping to spread the Cleveland cassata gospel. Thanks for the link on Facebook. Yes, dear doubters, this cake is real. Very real, indeed.
Pam Palos - Thanks for sharing your quest to find cassata in Phoenix. I guess it's up to you to show 'em how it's done. Enjoy!
Crystal - I'll have to give the cassata at Baraona's a try the next time I'm in Cleveland. Thanks for the tip.
Elizabeth - You're very welcome. I'm so glad that this recipe did the trick.
YAY CLEVELAND! I made this for a Cleveland visit for my dad's birthday, and it was super delicious and enjoyed by all. Thanks for the recipe!
I love this cake I'm makin it for a company potluck ! I'm going with roasted almonds along the sides . My cheat is vanilla pudding with whipped cream folded in.
My grandparents love Cassata cake, for their 50th wedding anniversary we purchased one from a local bakery. Now that I have moved from Cleveland to California, I no longer know where I can purchase one. Of all the recipes I have reviewed, this one seems to be the most appetizing and the only one with strawberries! I am now going to make this for my anniversary. Thanks for the detailed instructions!
My mother was up from Cleveland visiting last weekend ((I live in West MI now)). Her birthday is coming up next Saturday - but since i can't be with her then - I wanted to give her a special treat while she was here with us - her favorite cake - Cassata Cake! I called every single restaurant, store & bakery I could find and NO ONE knew what I was talking about! I even called the "elite" bakery in town that everyone raves about - and I had to describe the cake in detail to her - she said she's never heard of it. I had NO idea this was a Cleveland creation!!! Thank you SO much for posting your recipe!! I WISH I had found it last weekend...instead, my Mom and I came up with a cheater version. It was delicious - but I don't think compared to an ACTUAL cassata cake like yours!! I can't wait to share the recipe with her!!! Hopefully we'll be together again soon and we can make a day of this cake! THANK YOU!!! ((Oh - and i can't wait to tell everyone it's apparently from my home-town!! YAY!! One more reason Cleveland really DOES ROCK!!)) :) :)
Too funny....I had no idea this was a "Cleveland" thing!! I grew up in Strongsville...and was craving a good Cassata cake. When I went online- all the recipes had ricotta cheese in them- so I was confused. I'm glad to see that I'm not alone. Thanks for posting this recipe!! I can't wait to make it for my out-of-town guests- and to tell them it's a CLEVELAND cake!!!
Hey Jess! I'm trying this cake tonight for a memorial day shindig and I have a question on the custard: do you really go with no added flavor? It tasted so eggy to me that I had to add some vanilla, which worked well to balance the flavors.
Happy memorial day!
To all of you Clevelanders and cassata cake lovers - a belated hello and thank you for your wonderful notes and stories about the hunt for the perfect cassata! I love that I'm not the only one who gets excited about this cake.
Hi, Liz. Adding some vanilla to the custard certainly sounds good to me. I've kept it plain in the past, and I haven't ever had a problem with it tasting particularly eggy. Did you whisk the mixture constantly once it was over the heat? Without constant whisking, I think you might risk getting tiny bits of cooked egg in your custard, which could account for an eggy taste. Is it possible that that's what happened? Or, perhaps your custard was perfect, and you just happen not to like the flavor of the yolks. Another option for flavoring the custard: The original custard recipe suggests adding a tablespoon of Punsch (Swedish liqueur).
I hope that you enjoyed the cake, and that you're having a lovely holiday.
OK, more from me on this, my first layer cake!
Did you trim the layer's edges to make them even? I did, since there was some mushrooming puffiness on the top of the cakes. I threw them in a bowl with some strawberries and custard for a quick cook's trifle (to munch while preparing the cake).
PS: Thanks, Jess, for your reply! It just showed up after I'd finished writing my comment! I think it's the yolky flavor rather than bits of cooked egg, since the custard came out perfectly smooth. Cheers and happy mem day!
Hi Jess - greetings from NC! I just got back from a visit with my husband's family in Cleveland, and came across your blog while searching for a recipe to duplicate the cassata cake we had at Corbo's. I had run into the same ricotta problem that you and others have come across and am very grateful that you have done the work in piecing together a franken-recipe that works better! I can't wait to try this. If I get it right it will be my mother in law's birthday cake - but I'll need a few practice rounds I'm sure. =)
Thank you so much for this recipe! I grew up in Cleveland, and Corbo's cassata cake has always been one of my favorite things from back home. I was about to spend the day experimenting in the kitchen to try to duplicate it, but I am very happy that I found your recipe instead. The custard and strawberries are spot on.
Hi Jess,
Grew up in Cleveberg too. I'm going to make this cake for my birthday next month when my folks come to visit me here in S. Cal. (Very excited to blend all these memories.)
Per a previous comment.
What is your instinct about what type of rum to add to the custard?
Dark?
Light?
What proof? and
When do you add the rum to the custard mixture?
I grew up in the Cleveland area... we always had Cassata cakes for every occasion... happy to read your story... and find the recipe. Going to give it a whirl for my daughter's birthday. Would you put a fondant over this to make it a little fancier? My guess is that it would ruin it, but I'm just wondering your thoughts & or suggestions?
Hi, all
I'm just getting caught up around here and I hope I'm not too late in answering your questions. Let's get down to business:
Liz - I haven't had trouble with this particular recipe puffing up, but I have had some puffiness with other layer cake recipes I have made. When it happens, I just carefully level them off with a serrated bread knife and, preferably, a turntable. It sounds like you made perfect use of the trimmings!
Sherry - Thanks for your note. I'd love to hear how it went, if you think of it.
Lisa - So glad this post is helpful. It has been so long since I've had Corbo's cake that I honestly can't say whether this version is a true match. But it's definitely "in the style of." Enjoy!
Laura - The original recipe calls for Punsch, a Swedish liqueur, but rum sounds like a terrific substitution. I've never tried adding liqueur to my custard, so I can't speak from experience, but the original recipe has you add it once the custard has boiled and thickened, just before you chill it. I'm afraid that I have no instinct whatsoever to share with you about which rum might be best (shockingly, I've never baked with it!), but I have a feeling that you can't go wrong. If you do give it a try, I would be very grateful to hear what worked for you.
Anonymous - Happy birthday to your daughter! I've never found fondant particularly appetizing, even on fancy wedding cakes, so I'm probably not the best person to ask about this. But yes, I have a feeling that it would just be too much. The pictures in this post are from the first time I ever made this cake. In subsequent bakings, i've done a much better job dressing it up. First of all, my frosting has gotten much tidier. Also, I now use just-cut, not macerated strawberries on this cake. Take a look at the lemon version of this cake, and you'll see what I mean.
Thank you so much for your response... I'd decided against the fondant, afterall... wouldn't be a true cassata cake, anyway. I checked out your Lemon Cake... beautiful! For the cassata cake, do you not macerate the strawberries for the filling, either, now? I'm doing a practice one this weekend for my brother...
Hi again, Anonymous. I do macerate the berries for the filling. I just leave some strawberries unmacerated (is that a word?) for the outside of the cake. I apologize for the confusion. Once I have a consistent internet connection (I'm traveling right now) I'll go back into the post and edit the recipe to make sure that everything is clear and up-to-date. Your brother is a lucky guy to get to enjoy your practice run. Let me know how it goes, if you think of it!
Hello all,
My name is Jazz I am from Cleveland and I am glad to have found this recipe. I had no idea that this was a cake exclusive to Cleveland or better yet to Ohio. That is why I can�t find it anywhere but Cleveland. I now reside in Georgia. Thank you so much for posting it. I love this cake. My grandmother would make this cake for my birthday every year and I have yet to find any that could top hers or even come close. My friends surprised me for my birthday with one but it was chocolate. That was a first for me. I never knew there was such a cake as a Chocolate Cassata Cake. LOL! It is suppose to have strawberries and custard in it. LOL! My friends knew it was my favorite but had never heard of it or even seen one. I was grateful for the attempt anyway. I love them. Now I plan on making one for my birthday. By the way, my birthday is January 1ST. Thank you so much. Now I can give them a piece of Cleveland.
Ran across this looking for a recipe for cannoli cupcakes, and am so glad I did!!! I was raised, and still reside, in Cleveland. Corbo's desserts are absolutely the BEST in Cleveland,and the cassata cake heads the list! I am looking forward to trying this recipe, like the others, I have been unsuccessful in finding a stawberry/custard cassata recipe (the TRUE cassata, by the way...LOL). Thank you, thank you, thank you for making my day!!! I guess I am Anonymous 3...LOL
OMG, I love this recipe, I am from Cleveland (Slavic Villiage) and grew up on this cake and another version with a gram cracker crust on the bottom. I moved to Bend, Oregon about 6 years ago, and when I went to a bakery they did not know what a cassata cake was??? I was sad and tried to explain it, but they looked confused. I wanted it for my wedding but had to get a traditional cake instead. I visit Cleveland every year to see my family and getting Cassata cake is always on my list to do before i leave, but thanks to this recipe, I can now make it at home. I have my Birthday and College Graduation Party coming up in June and this Recipe is sure to be a hit. I am so excited that I finally found a recipe that is perfect! I plan to use the rum in mine though. Thanks again and I will eat a piece for you! I miss Cleavland and Cassata Cake!
Love this recipe, found it, printed and baked within hours...one question, the cake shriveled a little when cooling...is that normal? And that custard...really is magic...
Hi there, Anonymous, Anonymous, Anonymous, and Anonymous. Thank you for your wonderful notes! I love all of the enthusiasm for this cake and for our beloved city on the lake.
Anonymous from 4/27/2011: Yes, I find that the cake sometimes pulls away from the sides of the pan, but only a little. Nothing to worry about! (And yes, that custard...)
Overjoyed to find this recipe! Moved to Chicago too many years ago to count. Used to get a Corbo's Cassata cake every year for my birthday and I have missed them. They make Cassata cakes here in Chicago that are basically Strawberry Shortcake. We have family coming in from Cleveland for Memorial Day weekend and I am planning to make this cake for them. Since I'm making a spaghetti sauce recipe from my husband's Sicilian aunt, this will be a great finish to dinner! Thanks again for sharing this recipe. Love and miss all things Cleveland. ;)
That sounds like the perfect dinner, Donna. So great that you'll be baking up a little bit of Cleveland over there in Chicago! Enjoy!
Thank you so much for this recipe! I was born and raised east of Cleveland and grew quite fond of Cassata cake (and cannolis, too!) from Corbos! I am so glad to have stumbled upon this recipe and excited to share the recipe with my husband and his family that are not familiar with one of my very favorite cakes! I currently still live in Ohio (about 1.5 hours from Cleveland) and NO ONE down here knows what it is either! Thank you! :)
Hi, Anonymous. Well, you'll just have to show them what's what, right? I'm baking this cake again next week for a little friend of mine to celebrate her seventh birthday. I made it for her when she turned six, too, and she hasn't stopped talking about it all year!
I just made this cake for my mothers birthday and it was divine!!! Just like we had growing up...in you guessed::: CLEVELAND!!
:-) It was wonderous and beautious and I can not thank you enough. Your newest follower,
Kelly
Hello, Kelly. I'm so happy to hear that the cake was a success. Thank you for letting me know! I actually baked this very cake on Monday for my mother's birthday, too!
Hi, I was born in Cleveland, graduated from Strongsville, then moved to the west side of Cleveland (W. 130th area). There was an Italian bakery on W. 130th across from an Italian Restaurant/Bar. The bar was The Family Trio. I can't remember the name of the bakery. It has since moved to Strongsville, I think still on W. 130th. I had my first cassada cake from there and fell in love with it. I didn't know that the cake was a local Cleveland cake. I moved to Southern Illinois and went to a local bakery and ordered a cassada cake. It had anise and ricotta in it. It was horrible! I tried to make one on my own and totally failed. I found a recipe on the internet that was similar, and have made it twice. My birthday is this Sunday and I plan on making your recipe and hope it measures up to all the good raves I've been reading. I currently live in Panama City, Florida, and it sure would be nice to have a piece of home for my birthday. Thank you for posting this! I can't wait!!!! Sue
Hi, Sue. The Cleveland love that this cake has generated here in the comments section continues to blow me away! I hope this cake will be everything you want it to be. So you know, in my most recent version, I used only three layers of cake instead of four to make it a little more manageable. (You can freeze the fourth.) I put custard and strawberries between each layer. I think I like it better this way. I'll have to update the recipe. Happy birthday to you, and happy baking!
OMG a have lived in Cleveland all my life and recently moved out of state and missed this cake so much. I have been searching for the recipe for awhile and stumbled upon this site Thank you for the recipe. I haven't tried it yet but the picture alone brings back memories.
what do I do for high altitude?
I'm sorry to say that I don't know the first thing about high altitude baking. But I did find this resource over at Creative Culinary. I'm sorry that I can't be of more help.
if i wanted to cheat, what kind of box cake mix would i use? it's been a long time since i've had it and i can't remember if it was white or yellow cake.
Hi, Stephanie. I'd say it's closer to a white cake than a yellow cake, but keep in mind that the cake in this recipe is a sponge cake. A cake from a mix will be denser, closer to a traditional birthday cake. That's not to say it won't work; it will just be different!
JESS, I AM A BAKING FANATIC, I COULDN'T FIND THE RECIPE I USED LAST TIME I MADE CASSATA CAKE, SO I WAS DOING THE SAME THING AS YOU, SCOURING THE INTERNET TO FIND THE PERFECT RECIPE, I AM MAKING A FULL SHEET CASSATA CAKE TO FEED 30+ PEOPLE TOMORROW...SO MY BOYFRIENDS STEP FATHERS 60TH BIRTHDAY, I AM A NEW GIRLFRIEND, AND HAVE ONLY BEEN AROUND 5 MONTHS BUT LOVE LOVE LOVE BAKING, AND WAS HONORED THAT I AM BEING TRUSTED TO CREATE A DELICIOUS BIRTHDAY CAKE, HOWEVER I GET NERVOUS EVERY TIME I BAKE...WHAT IF IT ISN'T PERFECT...AND IN THIS CAKE IMPRESSING THE PARENTS...IN-FRICKING-TIMIDATING! ANYHOW YOUR STORY AND YOUR RECIPE ARE BEAUTIFUL, I BOUGHT BOXED POUND CAKE TO USE FOR THE CAKE I WAS MAKING, HOWEVER I BELIEVE I WILL TRY YOUR CAKE RECIPE AS WELL...JUST MIGHT HAVE TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE IT TO MAKE THE AMOUNT OF CAKE I NEED TO! THANKS FOR PUTTING THIS OUT THERE!
I'm excited to give this recipe a try! I remember my mother buying these cakes when I was a kid,(yes!)growing up in Warrensville in the 70's and 80's!
I made this recipe yesterday for a 90th birthday. I put strawberries and custard in between every layer and drizzled a little rum on the cake layers. It was a beautiful cake visually, stayed together very well and tasted delicious.
Thanks for the recipe!
Thanks so much for this recipe! Like a lot of others, I am a Cleveland girl with a Sicilian background and I searched the internet for a recipe exactly like this one! We always have strawberry/custard cassata at our weddings, and I was craving one. All the other recipes I found were for chocolate and rum cassata cakes. This recipe looks just perfect! The cakes are in the oven and the custard is in the fridge, but so far everything looks wonderful. I was so excited to find this and am so thankful that you've shared this recipe!!
Buon Appetito!
hello!
i had never made a homemade cake before and someone gave me this recipe to make for a 70th birthday coming up. well, i tried it before the party, to make sure it was tasty... it's delicious and the cake baked up soooo very nice!!
now, i have to make it into a half sheet cake (12x18 in my neck of the woods, florida). i believe it is sturdy enough. just off the top of your head, do you know how many cups of batter this one recipe makes? i will only be making the one layer and splitting that; i don't think it will fit into the cake box if do any more layers than the one. following your recipe, the 9" round cake i made was over 6" high!! it was gorgeolicious!
thanks for the recipe.
kristi
My sister wanted a Strawberry Cassata Cake for her birthday. I never made one before, and this was my chance. I used this recipe, but I found it on another site. I followed the recipe to the letter. But, along with it I made a Swiss Meringue Cream Cheese frosting also. I mixed the custard with the frosting....and baby.....you talking bout delish! I couldn't taste the entire cake until my sister cut it, but it was wonderful. Light and fluffy, the filling went really well with the strawberries. It was great. I will be adding this one to my collection of cakes. (When I was soaking the strawberries, I added a little amaretto to them along with the sugar)
Hi I posted a comment last August (2011) about this cassata cake. I had forgotten the name of the bakery on W. 130th where I had my first cassata cake, I remember now, it was Rito's Bakery. I made this recipe for my birthday last year and will be making this again this year and again, and again, and again! Thank you for this wonderful recipe. Sue
Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! We love cassata cake, and since we had to go gluten and dairy free in this house, I've frowned every time we drive past the local bakery (We're in Parma) I'm going to try and adapt this to be good for my son's food issues, but I'm so glad to finally find a recipe for cassata cake without ricotta!
Me and my husband went to Cleveland last year for a Dolphins vs Browns game and stumbled upon Corbos Bakery.. I just want to say it was thee best Italian bakery we've ever been to! We must have spent over $50 in there that night, we brought everything back to our hotel room and devoured it all!! Everything was awesome but I can't stop thinking about that cassata cake! My birthday is in just a couple of day & I will be making myself this cake! I'll let you know how it turns out! Thanks in advance for the recipe!
This is a save the day, moment. I lived in Cleveland for five years and was trying to hunt down what I enjoyed at many a party there. Thanks!

Paolo ready to close the deal after trio of talks (From Swindon Advertiser)
Sport
SWINDON TOWN: Paolo ready to close the deal after trio of talks
5:30am Friday 8th June 2012 in Sport By Sam Morshead
SWINDON are tantalisingly close to completing their first transfer business of the summer, if manager Paolo Di Canio is to be believed.
The Robins have been linked with several names since the end of the League Two season but no one has yet signed on to Di Canio’s revolution at the County Ground.
However, the Italian met with three players at SN1 yesterday and he has revealed that Town fans may not have to wait too long to discover the next names to be adorning the red shirts of their favoured club.
“We are close to someone that I met today. We’re very close, not even three days, someone to sign,” he said.
“They can think ‘Swindon: Best place, fantastic club, stronger board, the best manager. What do you want to improve as a footballer and to build the winning mentality?
“Obviously we are in contact with these players and I really think positively because the players that we will bring make me very happy.
“They are quality players and I am sure that they will make all the people around Swindon, the fans, very happy.”
Di Canio wants to secure the signatures of at least four players by the time he and his squad begin their pre-season schedule in July.
However, he accepted that it may take a little longer to assemble the group he believes is capable of claiming promotion from League One next term.
“Before the pre-season, which is very close, I think that if we can bring five players in the next 20 days we have a chance,” he said.
“If it’s not possible, four would be good because during the pre-season we still have plenty of time before 15 August.
“Obviously I would like to have all the players with me before but if we have the chance to bring five of the eight or nine that I would like to bring, it would be a perfect number.
Meanwhile, the Swindon boss dismissed reports linking him with moves for Charlton man Paul Hayes and Torquay midfielder Eunan O’Kane.
“Many names came out in the last few days,” he said.
“He (Hayes) is a good player but he is not, to be honest, our target at the moment. I don’t know in the future, now that you give me the information I’ll go to check, but he’s not on our list.
“O’Kane is a good player but we never asked him. There is not interest. He is a good player but not even at the moment or in the future because already in this position we have players - one very nearly to sign and one nearly to join.”

Post takes over Swisscom Print Centre
In future Swiss Post will be printing and packing around 100 million Swisscom customer letters. DocumentServices AG, a subsidiary of Swiss Post, is to take over the printing and packaging centre of Swisscom IT Services and all 58 employees with immediate effect. In so doing, Swiss Post's specialist in the field of pre-printing, printing and dispatching, document recording and electronic data management including archiving will reinforce its leading market position and expand its electronic document preparation operations in the new sorting centres in Zurich-Mülligen and Härkingen. Customer contracts governing related services such as data preparation by Swisscom IT Services will remain in force.
DocumentServices AG, a subsidiary of Swiss Post, is further expanding its leading position in the Swiss market as a specialist in customer communications: With immediate effect it is taking over Swisscom IT Services' PrintServices unit, which has a workforce of 58 and processes some 100 million letters a year for Swisscom. Swisscom IT Services will remain responsible for existing customer contracts and will continue to offer printing services, with particular emphasis on IT outsourcing projects, in partnership with Swiss Post.
By integrating DocumentServices AG directly in its state-of-the-art letter-sorting centres in Zurich-Mülligen and Härkingen, Swiss Post is expanding its focus on future-oriented electronic document preparation: Companies send their customer communications in electronic form to DocumentServices AG. The documents are then processed, printed and inserted in envelopes and sent to the sorting process for delivery to the customer's mailbox. This merging of interfaces between customer, print service and mail service, including sorting and delivery, simplifies processes and saves time, giving customers more time to prepare and submit their communications.
All employees to be transferred to DocumentServices AG
Swiss Post will take over all 58 employees as well as the existing infrastructure in order to ensure that Swisscom IT Services' service mandate in Berne is honoured. Both companies have worked out generous transitional solutions for staff, including a three-year security of tenure. All 58 employees have already signed a new contract of employment with DocumentServices AG.
DocumentServices AG
DocumentServices AG is a fully-owned subsidiary of Swiss Post. With a workforce of around 100, it generated revenue of close to CHF 29 million in 2005. The dynamic young Swiss Post subsidiary was created on 1 December 2004, when Swiss Post took over the DocumentServices division from Telekurs Services Ltd. On 1 July 2005, Swiss Post integrated the HybridPost business unit. DocumentServices AG is now a leading Swiss provider of professional customer communication services.

Facebook Leaks 'Memories,' New Fan Pages and Questions
The Fan Page prototype offers a tab-free experience, moving navigation to the left side of the page. Questions looks like it has been cleaned up since we last saw it, with a more prominent integration into the site's design. Similar to Google's multiple account feature for using two (or more) Gmail accounts at the same time, Switch Login lets you easily jump between different Facebook accounts. This should be great for power users that need to manage multiple pages and accounts.
Facebook Memories looks to be the most interesting prototype pushed out (see the screen capture above). Diving deep into your own Facebook history has always been a convoluted process, and Memories looks to make it easier to quickly browse your photos, status updates, new friends, likes and more. The module, organized by year, briefly appeared under some users' profile pictures. We wouldn't be surprised to see the Memories module mixed in with the Friendship pages eventually. It's perfect for parsing years of status updates between friends with just the right amount of creepiness.

Business News
Time to sell and buy!
by Peter Switzer good motivations to buy or sell over any one week. The majority ultimately will have their say via the dollars put on the line or taken off the table.
Right now, stocks have been spooked by Euro-debt worries, a possible slowdown in Asia and the US showing some economic softness.
The Dow lost 130.78 points, or 1.05 per cent, and is now off just over three per cent for the month.
Let’s a get a few things straight before we focus on the important issue for stock markets.
China’s economy
Talk of an Asian slowdown is overdone. China’s factory output growth fell to a 10-month low but it’s still expanding and is simply showing a response to its tightening of monetary policy. If China slows from 10 per cent plus growth to eight to nine per cent growth, that won’t be a challenge for related stocks.
To the US
In the US, the economy is softening but I have no fears that it will go into a worrying reverse. It can drop a pace and that can hurt stocks in the short-term but there’s no reason to expect a double-dip recession.
The big issue and unknown is European sovereign debt. Cameron Clyne, the CEO of NAB, says he has the issue under close watch and he thinks Spain is the critical economy. He argues Portugal, Ireland and Greece and their debt predicaments are well-known but Spain is a big economy that could unsettle global banks if a debt hiccup turns up.
A great analogy I came across runs like this: “The pilot has warned us to put on our seatbelts because turbulence is ahead. It’s not like he told us to put on the parachutes and line up at the exit doors.”
European concerns
On Europe, S&P’s downgrade of Italy from stable to negative unnerved investors but that was despite the fact that the Italian economy is doing OK.
Then, Spain’s ruling Socialist party copped a kick in the pants at weekend elections. And then the latest European purchasing managers index came in weaker than expected.
All of this should work against the strength of the Aussie dollar, which should help many local companies and could set us up for a rally later in the year.
Gain for Aussie stocks ahead
Last night I interviewed Brad Partridge from Macquarie Private Portfolio Management and our little chat resulted in the following conclusions:
- China’s slowing is not a worry
- The US is on track for a better second half economically and market-wise
- Euro-debt is the big concern because it is an unknown
- Locally he sees a 10 per cent gain from stocks over the next 12 months including dividends and capital gain. You could throw franking credits on top of this.
And this is why I’m comfortable with the current market choppiness and my only worry is will I time my buy into the low points of the market to perfection? Of course, I will stagger it and dollar cost average it so I can reduce the potential losses of going in too early.
Considering what we went through during the GFC, this is a pretty small problem to worry, May 24, 2011<<

Friday the Fever won the Intense Conference Championship 51-30. Monday SWX caught up with Fever wideout Steven Whitehead. The wideout the team is still on cloud nine after winning the conference title.
"We have unfinished business that we didn't take care of last year. Hopefully we get our chance this year to redeem ourselves. It's a little exciting heading back to Sioux Falls. I know a lot of people wanted Green Bay to win so we could have a home game. But I couldn't of wanted it any other way. To be the best you have to beat the best," Whitehead said.

Reservation Conflict in SSO Drive
Created: 02 Oct 2012 | Updated: 05 Feb 2013 | 2 comments
This issue has been solved. See solution.
Hi All,
This query is not about resolution but more over a deep study on Drives in SSO .
Reservation Conflict can be fix by below steps ..
But even after the drive goes down amd after looking into sys logs i find Reservation Conflict.
Cheer,
Rajesh Kumar
I will agree 100% that the steps could be used in troubleshooting (or some of them), but the comment - "Reservation Conflict can be fix by below steps" is wrong. The comment suggests that the problem can 'always' be fixed with these steps, which is untrue. Given the simple fact that the majority of reservation issues have a cause outside NBU.
Most of those commands don't fix anything if the reservation conflict is coming from outside NBU, which it probably is ...
1/ 2 are informational
3 - should force scsi reservations to be dropped. I agree, if NBU has just got confused, then this might fix the issue, but if the cause is still there, it will comae back again.
4. Nothing to do with the problem
5. Does not even make sense, though I know what you mean, which you have covered with step 4.
6. If no changes have been made, won't be this.
What devices see the drives - the most likely cause is something outside NBU is trying to access the drives.
Are drives shared with none NBU servers
Are people runnnig commands on the media servers
Are you using 'monitoring software'
Check zoning - are the devices you think see the drives the ONLY devices that see the drives ....
SAN errors
etc ...
Personally, I would probably remove and reconfigure the drives in NBU. I would not expect this to fix the issue (it might in rare cases) but it is the only way to demonstrate that NBU isn't the cause, because you have just given it a nice shiny new config.
Then, I would start on the list above. Do not try to troubleshoot this through NBU (providing the reconfig doesn't fix of course) because you will never solve it. NBU won't be causing the issue, it's just showing the issue.
Martin
In addition to Martin's excellent post:
Reservation Conflict is also commonly caused by lack of Persistent Binding in the environment.

Virtual Maching Backup Question
Created: 17 Nov 2012 | Updated: 19 Nov 2012 | 3 comments
This issue has been solved. See solution.
When backing up virtual machines (Hyper-v), i have been told to put an agent on the Host machine and set up a backup shedule for the host machine. Then on the Virutal Machine, put an agent inside the machine as well so that you can do granular file recovery etc. But on that agent that is in the Virutal machine, do you also set up a backup regime for it, or is it handled (proxied) through the host machine?
Thanks
You don't need to setup a backup regime for raws
The whole point of GRT is that it allows individual file and (supported) database content from within a VM without having to do a seperate agent based backup.
The reason an agent is needed for GRT is we gather catalog metadata and other information using that service and this enables us to access the granlar content during a restore.
Ok so just so that i understand this correctly. I put an agent on the host and have the backup regime there. I deploy an agent to the virtual but just leave it there without creating the backup regime.
Right?
Prytzen
You're correct you would deploy an agent on both the the Host machine as well as the guest your backups would be targeted to the host machine and this would provide you with a one pass backup for all of the vms running on that host " and application level grt for those that have an agent deployed on them"
Take a look at the following Docs

Onondaga County Sheriff Kevin Walsh breezed to his fifth four-year term Tuesday, setting the stage for him to become the county’s longest-serving sheriff.
Walsh collected 63.2 percent of the vote to beat two of his deputies, Joe Price on the Democratic line and Toby Shelley on the Working Families line. Price got 25.4 percent and Shelley 9.6 percent in the incomplete and unofficial returns.
It was the widest margin in any of Walsh’s four contested races over the past 16 years, both in percentage points (38) and in total votes (50,000).
Walsh thanked his 650 employees for his department’s accomplishments. He wasn’t ready to say whether he’ll run for a sixth term.
“I’d like to thank my wife of 42 years, who said that if I do say I’ll run again, it will only ever be 42 years,” Walsh joked on stage at the Republican party headquarters, surrounded by his family and wearing a toy sheriff’s badge with flashing red lights.
Later, he said the next four years will determine whether he runs again. He’s been in law enforcement for 47 years.
Walsh will surpass John Dillon as the longest-serving sheriff on Jan. 1, 2012. That will be the start of Walsh’s 18th year.
“I would much prefer to hear a title of the most productive sheriff or the most budget-conscious sheriff or the most crime-fighting sheriff,” he said. “I hope it won’t just be, ‘He was here longer than anyone else.’”
Walsh, 66, of North Syracuse, oversees a $36 million budget in a job that pays $106,611 a year.
Price, 43, of Baldwinsville, contended Walsh’s inattention to the Justice Center jail contributed to a no-accountability atmosphere that resulted in three inmates’ deaths over the past two years. Price upset the Democratic party designee, Shelley, in a primary.
Price’s campaign suffered a blow shortly after the primary when The Post-Standard revealed that dozens of racist, sexist and anti-gay comments were posted last year under his user name on an Internet forum. He denied posting all but three of them.

Scott Brennick is on his lunch break. Dressed in business clothes, the Manlius resident is combing the paths of Onondaga Lake Park to search for the hidden medallion.
“I’ve been reading the clues pretty closely every day,” Brennick said. “The park seems to fit the clues.”
The 25th annual Post-Standard Treasure Hunt is in its eighth day and searchers seem to have a pretty good idea of where it is.
Mike Petrivelli and Ryan Schneible pointed to Clues No. 1 and No. 2 as the most telling hints that the Medallion is hidden in Onondaga Lake Park.
“Well, it says a place you can walk and run,” said Petrivelli of Liverpool.
This is the first year that Petrivelli and Schneible have participated in the treasure hunt.
“It seems like it would be a fun thing to do,” Petrivelli said.
It was their first day searching.
“We just can’t seem to find the thing,” said Schneible of Cicero.
Kara Morris and Diana Ucchino of Baldwinsville were also in their first day of searching.
Morris said Friday’s Clue No. 8 about the string of lights was one of the hints that led her to believe the medallion is hidden at the park.
“It just sounded fun,” Ucchino said. “I know a bunch of people who were doing it and I wanted to look into it.”
Tiffany Stubbmann of Syracuse is in her second day of searching. Like Morris, Friday’s clue led her to Onondaga Lake Park.
Matt Bain, also of Syracuse, joined her in her search today. He said Clue No. 7 about the fire keeper hinted at the park. Earlier in the day, he and Stubbmann drove to Highland Forrest to look for the medallion.
“It’s exciting to see everybody looking,” Stubbmann said.
For Brennick, there is more to the contest than finding the medallion.
“For me, it’s about connecting with the area, the nature, for seeing parts of the county I usually wouldn’t get to see,” he said. Brennick has participated in the treasure hunt before, but has never found the medallion.
“I keep looking. Someday. One of these years.”
Today's Treasure Hunt clue was the eighth clue to the location of the hidden medallion.
Solve the clues and find the medallion, and you'll win $1,000. Double that to $2,000 if you're a home-delivered subscriber.

Android 2.3 Gingerbread to land on Samsung Galaxy S
Samsung Galaxy S owners will get Android 2.3 ... but when?
The Twitter feed of Samsung Mobile India confirmed to people tweeting to them asking about updates, that Samsung Galaxy S will have Android 2.3 Gingerbread, although no timing of the release has been mentioned.
Two tweets on their feed have confirmed that the update is incoming, although there isn't any conclusive UK release date on the horizon.
Android Gingerbread 2.3 was released to game developers only last week, and the Android 2.3 Gingerbread software update will be released in the next few weeks.
Of other mobile phone companies buzzing around Gingerbread, the LG Optimus Android 2.3 update is still unconfirmed while HTC's current range of Android phones will get Android 2.3.
Android 3.0 Honeycomb has already been demoed on a Motorola tablet, so we're hoping to be looking at Android upping its ante with updates over the next few months.
What features of Android 2.3 Gingerbread are you most excited about? We'd like to know, so head over to our Twitter and Facebook feeds and weigh in. Till you get Android 2.3 to tinker with, check out T3's Appvent calendar for free Android apps.

We're working to fix the problem right now and will have it working as soon as possible

La Purificadora
Callejon de la 10 Norte 802, Paseo San Francisco, Puebla, Mexico
Check availability as rates may vary for dates. Best rate guaranteed.
If not for the Grupo Habita, Mexico would be short about half a dozen very fine modern hotels. And if not for Habita’s newest, La Purificadora, the little colonial city of Puebla (on the road from Mexico City to Oaxaca) would likely be off our radar entirely.
This 19th-century water processing plant (hence the name) and bottling factory was redesigned by the famous Mexican modernist architect Ricardo Legorreta, the man behind Mexico City’s famous Camino Real hotel. It’s a departure from the style of his brightly colored mid-century masterpiece, but then again it’s not the middle of the century anymore — aside from some judiciously applied violets, La Purificadora is fairly austere, in blacks, whites, and natural wood and stone, with the exterior walls and some interior surfaces remaining untouched and unpainted.
La Purificadora’s twenty-six rooms are more welcoming, less stark, as they ought to be — comfort is key, and architectural heroics are limited to the occasional balcony or, in the case of the Royal bedroom, a room-length terrace. Other highlights include a 30-meter (not a typo) elevated glass-walled swimming pool, a restaurant with an outdoor patio, and an extensive wine cellar — more fun than water, any day.
How to get there:
La Purificadora is approximately a 20 minute drive from Puebla-Hermanos Serdán International Airport. Transfers can be arranged for USD52 for up to 2 guests, each way. Transfers can also be organized from the Mexico City Airport for USD152 for up to 2 guests, each way. Please contact CustomerService@TabletHotels.com for assistance with airport transfers.

What I liked:
A stunning architectural conversion, with great food and good service. The roof terrace bar is a treat.
What the hotel could do better:
Soundproofing...a loud wedding could be heard everywhere due to open nature of the space. The much highlighted swimming pool requires two hours advance notice before using! And several things in our room did not work (iPod dock, air conditioning) and did not get fixed.

In the busy schedule of congresses, symposiums, conferences and workshops devoted completely or partially to nano-photonics it is a hard job to decide which one suits your needs at best.
Topics include theoretical and numerical studies of different aspects of light generation, control and detections in micro- and nano-structured materials, including but not limited to general inhomogeneous media, plasmonic structures, metamaterials, biological systems, photonic crystals, integrated optics components and systems.
The workshop will take place in the historical house of the "Physikzentrum Bad Honnef", Bad Honnef, Germany. The "Physikzentrum" is ideally suited for the workshop purposes and provides accommodation and state of the art presentation facilities.

A Spar retailer took his turn as an Olympic torchbearer earlier this week.
Mike Blowing, of Great Kingshill Village Store, carried the torch as it passed through Aylesbury during the morning.
After running his leg, he hosted a fun event at his store in High Wycombe between 3.30pm and 6.30pm where visitors were able to sample various different products, enjoy wine tasting and take home a bag of treats.
There was also entertainment for children in the form of face painting, balloon modelling, a Cadbury character and goodie bags.
A long queue formed for visitors to have their photograph taken with Mike Blowing and the Olympic torch and a raffle in aid of the NSPCC raised more than £500.
Spar was given a torchbearer place by Lloyds TSB and Blowing was chosen by his wholesaler AF Blakemore as the “ideal candidate” due to the volume of community work he does. He is well known for supporting local projects and is highly involved with a local school.
He said: “This was an absolutely fantastic, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It was a brilliant day and I am really proud. I would like to say thank you to everyone who came to my store after the torch relay and made the day into a huge success.”

About a month after closing one restaurant and opening another, the Green Iguana Bar & Grill is shutting down its Dale Mabry location near Raymond James Stadium.
Green Iguana's parent company, G.I. Entertainment & Restaurant Group, announced Monday.
Rumors about the closure came to head when musicians performing at Green Iguana locations were notified of the pending plans. and leased the space. Green Iguana's Hawaiian Village directly behind it quickly became a popular concert venue, drawing big names like Korn, Anthrax and Paul Oakenfold, and popular events like DayGlow parties.
In May, Green Iguana closed its St. Petersburg waterfront location at 8790 Bay Pines Blvd., after the G.I. Entertainment & Restaurant Group decided not to renew its lease. The same month, Green Iguana opened at Tampa International Airport.
The first Green Iguana opened more than 20 years ago on West Shore Boulevard in Tampa, followed by locations in Brandon, Ybor City and on Anderson Road near the Veterans Expressway. The Ybor City location is a franchise owned by Jason Fernandez, who also owns Bernini, Hot Willy's and the new Carne Chophouse, all in Ybor City. In addition, Green Iguana's parent company owns Hula Bay Club and the Retreat, both in Tampa.
Home of $5 burgers on Monday and other daily specials, the chain has built a following around its live music and Caribbean-inspired casual atmosphere. Last month, Green Iguana's hamburgers took top honors at the first Burger Showdown at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park in Tampa.

William N. Lipscomb Jr., 91, a Harvard chemistry professor who won a Nobel Prize in 1976 for his research on the structure of molecules and on chemical bonding, died Thursday in Cambridge, Mass., of pneumonia and other complications of a fall. He was a protege of two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, and two of his graduate students and a third who spent time at his lab went on to win Nobels.
Charles Laufer, 87, who built a publishing career with youth-oriented fan magazines such as Tiger Beat, died of heart failure on April 5 in Northridge, Calif. The magazine's mainstay, copied by so-called teenzines to this day, was to publish articles on "guys in their 20s singing La La songs to 13-year-old girls," he said in an interview with the Seattle Times in 1992.
Mike Campbell, 78, a ferociously independent white Zimbabwean farmer who sued his country's autocratic ruler, Robert Mugabe, to stop the seizure of his land and improbably won, only to lose the farm when the government defied the court ruling, died on April 6 in Harare.
Daniel Catan, 62, a Mexican composer known for bringing Spanish-language operas into the international repertory, including an adaptation of the film Il Postino that starred Placido Domingo in its world premiere last year, died in his sleep on April 8 in Austin, Texas.
Hedda Sterne, 100, an artist whose association with the Abstract Expressionists became fixed forever when she appeared prominently in a now-famous 1951 Life magazine photograph of the movement's leading lights, died on April 8 in New York.

ST. PETERSBURG
They set up their table at the Central Avenue bus depot. Unfolded an easel to hold their sign. Spread out a tablecloth printed with flags.
The air smelled like exhaust and Popeye's fried chicken. They had to shout over the engines.
"Hey there! Are you all registered to vote? Anyone need to sign up to vote in November?" Raechel Garafalo, 49, called to the crowd.
An elderly woman eating yogurt ignored her. A young woman pushing a stroller with two toddlers shook her head.
"I can't vote," said a man in a Rutgers T-shirt. "I'm an ex-con.".
"It's important to reach out to people and try to make this process easy," Rice said.
While lawmakers argue about purging voter rolls and law enforcement officers investigate whether a company the Republican Party hired turned in fraudulent applications, the nonpartisan group's volunteers have registered 3,219 new voters.
Tuesday is the last day Florida residents can register to vote in the Nov. 6 election. So all last week, and through the weekend, volunteers carrying clipboards worked crowds at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus and at a job fair. At an outdoor market Saturday morning in St. Petersburg, volunteers registered nine new voters: one Republican, three Democrats and five without affiliation.
"Democracy works best when people of all demographics get to the polls," Rice said.
Many of Florida's 11.4 million voters register when they get their driver's license, or at local elections offices. Others sign up at drives sponsored by political parties and nonpartisan groups. Before the last presidential election, anyone could register new voters.
But in May 2011, a new law required groups conducting voter signups to register with the state. And instead of having 10 days to turn in new registration forms, people had to turn in paperwork within 48 hours or risk fines of up to $1,000.
"It really felt like the state was trying to criminalize the act of registering people to vote," Rice said.
So, for the first time in its 72-year history, the Florida chapter suspended its registration drives — and sued the state.
"We went a whole year without being able to register people," said Jessica Lowe-Minor, the state's executive director. "That's a lot of time wasted."
In May, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction to block the new law. Over the summer, lawyers for the League and state settled and volunteers kicked their signup campaigns into overdrive.
"All of our workers are volunteers; all of our volunteers are trained," Rice said. "They have to pass a quiz to show they know the rules before they can go out there with clipboards."
League volunteers aren't allowed to wear political buttons or shirts, or anything endorsing a candidate. They don't ask people who they're going to vote for, and can't encourage them to pick a particular party. They ask everyone where they live, if they're a U.S. citizen and whether they have been convicted of a felony. Everyone gets a black pen.
"Hey, how you doing? Are you registered to vote?" Garafalo called about 3 p.m. Sweat streamed from beneath her visor. Her water bottle was empty.
She had been at the bus depot for more than an hour and had helped four people fill out forms to change their addresses, given three felons a number to call to try to get their voting rights restored, and registered one man who didn't want to claim a political party.
Just after 4 p.m., an older couple climbed off the bus, saw the League's sign, and headed straight for the flag tablecloth. Tony Doyle, a Vietnam vet, and his wife, Sherry, were returning home from his checkup at the VA hospital.
"Okay," he said to Garafalo. "What do I have to do?"
The Doyles had been married for 32 years — and fought over eight presidential elections. Sherry, 57, voted in every one. Tony, 65, had never registered.
He decided on his own to sign up. His wife didn't have to push him. "I got to help get the right candidate voted in," he said while Garafalo looked over his form. "President Obama, he needs four more years to put in place the things he said he would do."
"Okay, you're all set," Garafalo said, shaking his hand.
The retired Marine smiled. "That was easy."
At 5 p.m., rain was splashing the street and wind whipped the registration sheets off the table. The volunteers decided to hold on a little longer to catch people coming home from work.
A young couple was the last to climb off the 5:45 bus. Her arms were laden with shopping bags. He cradled their month-old daughter. "Hello!" said Garafalo. "Do you all need to register to vote?"
Reina Mangum-Ortiz, 20, is a student at St. Petersburg College. Her fiance, Deontae Jones, 25, manages a Wendy's and is studying to become an engineer. They looked at each other and laughed.
"We were just talking about that, how we had to figure out how to get to the courthouse and go do that tomorrow," said Mangum-Ortiz. "I wasn't old enough to vote for the president last time. And I know people say your vote doesn't matter, but I know it does. I want to make a difference."
She put down her shopping bags and picked up a pen.

Kent. I happen to be here at work where we have Five 32" flat screen monitors. I tuned to 144.390 on my Yaesu VX-150 and ran it by each. No signal interference. They are different brands and models with the oldest being 6 year old Plasma Sony units and the newest being Winbook and Sceptre. If you are still under warranty I'd get a tech out there. They will try to pull Part 15 out on you but you hit back with Part 97. What would they have to do if this was your neighbors set under warranty and you made an FCC complaint about it? Last resort is to actually make that complaint yourself. Sweep the set with a service monitor if you have one and note all the other frequencies it radiates.

"I want a bouquet of berries!"
That's what my friend Laura exclaimed when we met at the florist to talk bouquets for her upcoming wedding.
"You mean...for real..or on your cake, as a separate flavors, as favors? What? What?"...
Can't you just sense the panic in my voice? Lord knows I love Laura, I laugh with her, cry with her, call her crazy and yet, I never know when she is joking when she is in charge of making decisions. See, Laura has already changed her mind 3 times for her dress...after it was bought. The ceremony has been changed just about everytime the wind changed direction, the vows?...typed, backspaced, saved, erased, and started over countless times. A couple of things have remained: the groom is still "The Original One" as we have nicknamed Jason, her husband to be, and as always her group of friends has vowed to throw her into the pool after the big event.
I met her while at the restaurant, she was waiting tables and quickly volunteered to be my dessert guinea pig. Laura loves to organize big parties, Halloween bashes, fundraising dinners, etc...and she is good at it. She knows to bring people together, her diplomacy is impeccable and she never loses her cool...but she ended up in the pool more times than she remembers. Over the years we have learned to let her talk and scribble away and wait a couple of days for the finalized plan.
So when she said she wanted a bouquet of berries, I, on the other hand saw a big blue pool... I should have trusted her and let her finish her sentence instead. Had I paid attention, I would have noticed that she was on the phone with Old Chef telling him she did not want a wedding cake but a couple of plated desserts. There will be a mini version of Jason's favorite, Carrot Cake, made by our friend C., the other pastry chef in the group, and I would make Laura a dessert that represents her. Except nothing really "represents" Laura given her ever changing nature. I threw some ideas to her and finally drew sketches of charlottes made of thin toasted coconut ladyfingers, filled with a raspberry mousse and topped with whipped cream to evoke the white of her wedding dress and topped with berries....a bouquet of berries. One decision made, 85 of these to make for her wedding this coming Saturday.
When I make charlottes at home for the family, I like to use savoiardi cookies, not that I am lazy to make my own but they remind me of my grandparents who always kept a box in their pantry. My grandma would give us some to dunk in our tea or hot chocolate and we had a contest to see who could dip the longest without the cookie disintegrate on them. My grandfather would give us some whenever the adults had Champagne so we could get a little taste. I have to admit though that eating freshly made ladyfingers ranks as high as eating freshly cooked sables or shortbreads...very high. Before you run away when you look at the recipe: once again I am a big advocate of spreading plated desserts preparationover a couple of days if you need. Make the ladyfingers one day and store them in the fridge in a tight container and tackle the mousse the next.
For Laura's dessert, it was easier to make them and pipe the batter thin to mimic flower stems. The mousse base is a quick Chiboust cream where instead of the traditional Italian Meringue, whipped cream is added to a creme anglaise base and held with some gelatin. There are also two kinds of Chiboust, one with creme anglaise, one with pastry cream, I went for the former. We went for raspberries but strawberries or other would work quite well. For work production purposes I purchased frozen organic raspberries, let them thawed and mashed them before adding them to the mousse base. I like to fold the fruit base into the whipped cream and not the other way around. I find it more consistent, faster and more reliable, but you will read different directions on the subject so experience to find the one you like best.
Toasted Coconut And Raspberry Charlottes:
Makes 6, 3 inch wide charlottes
For the ladyfingers:
1/2 cup (65 grams) cake flour
3 large eggs yolks
1/2 cup (1oo grams) sugar, divided
3 egg whites
1 teaspoon orange blossom water
pinch of salt
1/2 cup to 3/4 grated coconut (both unsweet or sweet are fine)
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
- Fit your mixer with the paddle attachment and beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar until thick and pale yellow at high speed for about 5 minutes. Add the orange blossom water and give the mixer another quick whirl to combine.
- Transfer the batter to a bowl, and sift the cake flour over it but do not fold it in yet.Wash your mixer's bowl thoroughly before proceeding with the egg whites.
- Fit your mixer with the whisk attachment and whip the egg whites until foamy. Add the pinch of salt and increase the speed and whip until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and whip until stiff peaks. Fold the whites into the egg yolk and flour mixture in three additions, mixing just until incorporated. Do not over fold or you will loose air and the cookies will turn flat.
- Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitting with narrow tip (I used Ateco #807) and pipe the batter into 6 3 inch circles first, then continue with the remaining batter to make 4 inch long ladyfingers.keeping one inch space in between them. Feel free to draw circles and lines on the parchment paper and to invert it prior to baking (so you don't get ink or pencil lines on your cookies) as a guide.
- Sprinkle as little as 1/2 cup to as much as 3/4 cup of grated coconut, depending on your taste.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the ladyfingers are firm but only slightly browned and are spongy when pressed with a finger.
- Remove them from the oven and let the baking sheets cool on wire rack for a few minutes. It will be easier to remove the cookies from the parchment paper if you do so when they are still a little warm. Once lifted from the paper, let the cookies cool completely on wire racks before using them.
For the raspberry mousse:
250 ml (1 cup) milk
1/4 cup (55 grams) sugar
3 egg yolks
2 tsp Chambord
2 tsp powdered gelatin + 1/4 cup cold water
1 1/2 cups frozen raspberries, thawed and mashed with a fork
3/4 cup heavy cream
Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and set aside to bloom.
In a medium bowl, whisk the sugar and egg yolks until pale yellow. In the meantime time, in a medium saucepan, heat the milk to boiling point. Slowly pour some of the hot milk over the egg yolks to temper them. Add the remaining milk in one steady stream, whisking well. Pour the liquid back into the saucepan, and cook over medium low heat until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, add the Chambord, raspberries and gelatin and stir until the latter is completely dissolved.
Let cool to room temperature. In a large bowl or in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the cream to soft peaks. Incorporate the raspberry base in 2 additions into the cream. Use immediately.
To assemble the charlottes:
Place 6 rings onto a parchment line baking sheet. Line 6 rings with parchment paper, place a disk of ladyfinger cookie at the bottom and line the inside with as many fingers as will fit in them. Divide the mousse evenly in between the rings. Refrigerate until completely set.
When ready to serve, unmold the charlottes and top with whipped cream and fresh berries.

Très joli et très photogénique - en plus, j'adore les framboises :)
beautiful as usual!
I don't think Laura will want to change her mind after seeing and tasting such a beautiful and delicious dessert! And if she does, well, there's always the swimming pool! (Hah! Threats always work!) I LOVE raspberries, and I've not made mousse with Italian meringue before :)
Perfect and amazingly beautiful, as always!
Cheers,
Rosa
Wow, those look so beautiful!
purty! so very purrtyy!! the innards look so inviting ^_^
Thankgod laura didn't change hermind about jason :-)
Love the charlotte.
Looks so beautiful.
such a pretty dessert !! love it ;-)
did you forget to mention the egg whites in the lady finger's ingredient list ? (I can only see the egg yolks) - thank you
This is so elegant... And I'm sure it tastes delicious. What can I say? When I see your photos I feel like in an art gallery, all senses involved (not only for the eyes but also for your nose, your mouth and, of course, for your heart). You are really an artist.
u have such amazin pics. how do u do them. r u a pro.
how lucky is she to have you as a friend! charlottes are always so elegant and really do impress. beautiful work!
how absolutely lovely.
These are just gorgeous! :)
Mmmm looks and sounds heavenly! Yummmmm I want!
Beautiful!
these are so delicate and feminine Helen! So lovely and perfectly ... the most beautiful little charlottes ever...
A bouquet of berries is lovely!! And unique :0)
Gorgeous Charlottes!
Argone: I sure did forget! I rectified that. Thank you!
Perhaps Laura wants the very best things for those around her or those whom she brings together. Therefore she could not make up her mind on what could make everyone happy. Maybe ask her what she wants if there's only her and "The Original One" at their wedding? That may do the trick.
I think they are many who wish to live next door to you, Helen. Including I, of course. Who in their right mind would not want to be your dessert guinea pig?!
Amazing ! I wouldn't mind those at my wedding, either :-)
Suparna: thank you, but no I am not a pro photographer. There are so many more talented photographers out there, but thank you for the compliment!
What beautiful bouquets Helen!! I'm sure Laura would be very pleased!!
Wonderful Charlotte!
Laura is one lucky bride to have these showing up at her wedding! They are just gorgeous and I'm sure everyone will be wowed. My daughter and I were just discussing how the most common wedding problem is bad cakes. Good thing Laura went with the best- it won't be a problem for her!
beautiful pictures,as always! It's true that the freshly made ladyfingers are uncomparable. I recently made some for a cake, and I love it so much! Now I need to try your version with toasted coconut and orange blossom water.
Those are beautiful bouquets! I love all the fruits you used on top!
gorgeous , Helen! Uh...and you are making how many of these... 85?!
cute Charlottes!!!!those ribbon were lovely too!
Absolutely beautiful Helen.
I discourage making lady fingers, because my technique of piping anything is always turns out to be a disastrous! Too big, too small, too fat, too thin, too long, too short. Is there such a thing as a lady finger mold? maybe in France? any encouraging tip perhaps? You know, like the one that you gave us for macarons. I am sure there are many of your reader are like me, not really that good of making lady finger, or am I alone in this one?
These desserts are so beautiful! Laura is lucky to have such a talented friend as you helping out!
They are gorgeous! What a lucky friend yours is! I think she can even enter the church with a plate of this charlotte, for the ultimate berry bouquet, lol!
These are just the prettiest little things that I ever did see! I wish that I could make my tasty-things look half as beautiful as you do.
How lovely. Sigh.
Am at a loss for words Helen...but can say, maybe I wish I was getting married again...to the same man I've married but closer to where you live...if only for the sake of something as stunning as this!! LOL...what a GREAT friend you are!
Helen, you have truly contributed something unique and special to the bride's wedding day. Give yourself a pat on the back for these very sweet desserts. They are 'easy on the eyes' shall we say, as I am sure the bride was.
These are the sweetest things I've ever seen!
Elra: as I mentionned in the instructions, it is helpful to draw lines and rounds on parchment paper and to invert it prior to baking. As far as coming flat or thin, make sure not to overfold or the cookies will deflate on you and will spread out to the side.
What a lucky friend - these are just gorgeous!
Literally gorgeous!
--Marc
Such a nice friend you are! I think you should (for her) make one that is blue - the color blue of a pool ;) You are such a maestra!
Every time I visit your blog I am blown away! You are amazing! This dessert is stunning!
Just georgeous!!! they look fantastic and so delicious. Really, really a great job!!
Ana
What a gorgeous wedding treat this while be! I love the ribbon and fresh berries!
I think I was eight the first time I tasted a berry charlotte... I still remember where it was, whose house it was and everything about that lovely afternoon at our friends' house.
I remember my life through food.:-)
Your friend Laura sounds like she is a riot to be around. And this Charlotte dessert looks amazing!!!
I wish Laura all the best!
I remember the hard time I had choosing my wedding dress... And I did have some trouble with the shoes as well. ;)
These are adorable, Helen - such a sweet gesture!
What a yummy looking dessert! Still, I need to make or even just taste a charlotte! Beautiful job!
absolutely divine!
Laura's lucky to have a friend like you--those are so intricately put together and look tremendous
How pretty. I'd have carried these down the aisle at my own wedding, but I doubt I would refrain from eating it before I reached the altar. :-D
You had me in stitches when I read that at least the groom is still "The Original One".
Thanks for the photos- this looks too pretty to eat (almost!). Seems Charlottes are getting really popular again these days and I will have to try to make one myself. Thanks!
Your charlottes are super charming!! They're beautiful with the pink ribbon...
Can I untie one of those?
:)
oh my goodness. c'est trop. anything is better with coconut, i dont care what it is. i had a good friend at my foyer in paris named charlotte, i always wanted to make her a cake and say "how many times have you been given one of these!" this would be more perfect though--c'est petit et plus comme un cadeau.
You take the most delicious, beautiful pictures I have ever seen! =)
Your friend is so lucky for being able to have you make this beautiful dessert for her!
Simply stunning! They really do look like a basket of berries!
They are so romantic and beautiful!
This looks heavenly!
Okay, this is just flippin' gorgeous. Again, as always. You have an amazing talent.
Hmmm next time I make individual charlottes I'm going to try this ring mold method.
Bouquet of Berries! I love it. Sounds like a great title for a cookbook!
Perfect! You are a genius - I can't believe how well you translated her wishes into such a lovely dessert.
Gorgeous pics! I'm just so in love with your food styling! and I wouldn't mind a tasting your desserts in person one day!
Jaden: who knows...I might just use that title instead since we have not finalized one yet :)
What a delight for the eyes! It would have tasted wonderful1 No u'e reind is not crazy but intelligent enough to get your creativity triggers fort his wonderful dessert! thanks to her!
I made desserts for 260 people on Wednesday...I wish you were there to help me....This is so beautiful and if your friend changes her mind about this one...send her to me!!!!
I consistently feel the need to cry when I see your creations. They're so beautiful!!
i want a bouquet of berries too! so beautiful. you are a genius...so talented. i'm always so inspired by your creations, tartelette :)

Ali
How absolutely beautiful, Helen. Laura is a lucky girl to have you as a friend.
How beautiful, what a lucky bride.
those are exquisitely gorgeous! so delicate!
Gorgeous, I love it when a dessert (as well as a blog post) tells a good story!
Simply put - GORGEOUS! Laura should be very happy about this dessert:) And she is lucky to have a friend like you:)))
Those beauties truly are the prettiest dessert I have ever seen! Absolutely gorgeous photography, too.
Your blog is beginning to convince me that my new "eating regimen" is terribly boring.
I am so happy to see the fabric is going to good use. :)
So feminine, light and colorful. By George, I think you nailed it!
Oh you nailed it alright!
Sounds like I would greatly enjoy Laura. I wish her a beautiful day, these desserts will be beautiful!
Helen, I can't even put to words how beautiful this creation is! Seriously, what I would give to have your talent...
This looks delicious!!!! I wish I was gifted in the food department!!!
This looks so cute, Helen.
From the time I turned vegan I haven't been able to try out much from your blog but I keep coming back for more stories and more pictures - and always go back contented:) Laura is lucky to have you making this for her!
Helen! This is such a marvellous one!
Let me know if Laura chages her mind just on time, and you are welcome to Istanbul for my wedding (probably on November) :)))
What a beautiful view!
I'm just focused, and can't move =p~
85!
And I'm the 85th commentor on this one.
Friend Laura is LOVED!!!
And you are a genius and St. Jean D'Arc to make all these.
I'm agog...

worth getting married just to get 85 of these beauties!
Those look gorgeous Helen ...very very pretty !
How incredibly lucky the bride! Charlottes are amazing!
Certainly an auspicious beginning to a lifetime relationship! What an absolutely incredible dessert. Stunning, really!!

Such little and sweet beauties!
I love your photos Tartelette!
what a BEAUTIFUL dessert and lucky bride to be! :)
une merveilleuse recette sublimée par des photos superbes
Rien que de regarder les photos, je me régale, je suis en train de devenir complètement accro.
C'est absolument magnifique !
Congrats for the first overall winner of DMBLGIT Oct 2008.
When I saw it, I knew that you'll win. It is so beautiful.
i just made these charlottes but as a single cake and not as separate cakes. i had some problems (not a strange thing). I'm new at cooking and baking but not afraid to try. So for future reference I would like to ask - shouldn't lady fingers be submerged into warm milk and Chambord or some such alcohol - I'm afraid that my will be dry! And i didn't put lady fingers on the bottom:((( is it unforgettable?
Iva: no, they should not submerge. They would disintegrate from being under that much liquid. If you mean lightly brushed or dipped in liquid, very little and very briefly then. Here it was not necessary because the filling softens the cake.

I hope you all had a fantastic holiday weekend. We kept it low key having dinner with a good friend on Christmas Eve and with family on Sunday. Yesterday was spent with friends again over a light lunch and a relaxing afternoon.
Thank you everyone for the sweet and kind words of condolences about my grandfather's passing. It made this weekend a little easier to navigate. Oh there were tears, trust me...but they were immediately followed with a feeling of peace. My heart was full of all the goodness one can give and receive in a lifetime. Thank you again for your patience and care.
Let me play Santa a little bit longer and announce the winners of the Christmas giveaway. I asked my dear and only to give me three numbers at random among all the valid entries. Yes, he's my random number generator.
The two winners of Plate To Pixel are Jenny Mendes and Adrienne from A Big Mouthful.
The winner of Girl Hunter is Wen from Journal Through Lens. Congrats! Please send me your snail mail addresses at mytartelette AT gmail DOT com.
Now on to the recipes...
Every year at Christmas, smoked salmon has to be part of the appetizer offerings at my parents'. It's tradition. Salmon, blinis and foie gras with brioche toasts. Since we started last week without any firm plans for Christmas Eve, I was making my own plans to prepare a nice dinner for two and relax on the back deck watching all the docks decorated with Christmas lights. A sight to be seen...for sure.
On the menu was a Salmon Bisque, followed by crab cakes and finished off with a Pistachio and Pear Gratin. As the soup was simmering, my inbox started buzzing and within minutes our plans had changed for the 24th. Not a problem. From the scents wafting through the kitchen, we would not be disappointed to have it for lunch the next day. The soup was a cinch to put together, light and tasty. Everything one can ask for during busy times and especially in between a few copious meals.
The gratin was a unexpected hit with Bill and one I will repeat soon and with other fruits too. I had a surplus of tiny cute Forelle pears from a couple of projects and was trying to find other ways than tarts and tartlets to use them. Nothing wrong with those...trust me. I am the first one to slow down for a slice of pear tart!
This dessert is the perfect results of many kitchen happenings all coming together at once. Too many pears, red currants finally being available now that the temperatures had dropped, a pound cake made on a whim one night I could not find sleep and there you have it. A light, fragrant, cozy and comforting vanilla custard blanketing thin slices of cake with tart little pops of red currants every other bites.
From the look of immense delight at the dinner table the other day, I can safely say these two recipes were a huge hit. Making another batch of soup today!
Salmon Bisque, adapted from Saveurs France:
Serves 4 to 6
Notes: do not worry about how fine a dice, cube or chop, the ingredients are since they are all going to be pureed. Croutons are somewhat of a tradition in my family with soups and I simply toss some cubed day-old bread with a little bit of olive oil, salt and pepper and toast that over the stove. Crème fraiche is a perfect topping for the soup but sour cream is a fine substitute.
Salmon can be expensive, so I usually ask my fish guy at the store to give me the good scraps they cut off when filleting whole fish. They are most happy to find a taker and usually give me half price on those.
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 leeks, white parts only, well cleaned and sliced
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 carrots, sliced
2 small red potatoes, peeled and diced
½ cup dry white wine
3 cups vegetable stock
1 pound skinless salmon fillets, cubed
salt and pepper to taste
croutons, crème fraiche and chives to garnish
Directions:
In a large stock pot, heat the oil over medium. Add the leeks, garlic, carrots and potatoes and sautee for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the white wine, stock and salmon. Season with a little salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then immediately reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the heat, let cool and puree until smooth (see notes). Check the seasoning and serve. Top each bowl with some croutons, crème fraiche and chives if desired.
Earlier this year, the nice folks at Blendtec gifted me with one of their mixers and this is what I now use all the time to puree and blend soups. Takes less than a minute for super smooth bisques and soups. A immersion blender or any good capacity and sharp bladed food processor will also do great here.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pistachio and Pear Gratins, adapted from Saveurs France.
Serves 6
Notes: I love my friend Jeanne’s recipe for pound cake. I had the pleasure this summer to work with my friend Clare on Jeanne’s gluten free baking cookbook and had to make about 75% of the recipes for photography. I got to tell you, Jeanne is about the only person I now trust for gluten free baking anything. Everything is always tasty, correct and of great texture. The recipe she came up with years ago for her gluten free all purpose flour blend is super easy and substitute cup for cup with regular all purpose flour so feel free to go gluten free or not without fear.
Once the pound cake is made and cooled (feel free to prepare it a day in advance), the assembly comes together in no time.
Ingredients:
6 small Forelle pears (or 2-3 medium pears)
12 thin slices of Jeanne's pound cake (minus the glaze)
1 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
½ cup sugar
½ cup red currants or other berries
2 tablespoons finely ground pistachios
Directions:
Butter a 9x13 gratin dish or individual ones and preheat the oven to 350F. Position a rack in the center.
Peel, core and thinly slice the pears. Set aside (don’t worry about oxidization too much since the dessert assembly is fast but you can always sprinkle them with a bit of lemon juice if you wish).
Cut the pound cake slices in triangles. Set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, vanilla, eggs and sugar until smooth.
Layer the pear and pound cake slices in your gratin dish(es). Slowly pour the custard batter on top. Bake for about 30 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm with some red currants and ground pistachios scattered over the top.

Both look amazing, but I'm all about that bisque right now.
I love currants, so as soon as they are available in my area (much later than in yours) I'm going to make the gratin. Thank you!
Mmmm...that bisque sounds so good. With all of the rich foods lately, soups are lining up at our house. I wish I could find currants around here...they are so petite and pretty.
smoked salmon is a must in my family as well for Christmas. This year, being in charge of the menu for the very first time, I decided to make the gravlax and used your recipe as starting point, adding pink peppercorns, black pepper and Sichuan pepper.
So I'm a great fan of everything made with salmon, this bisque sounds divine!
The gratin seems another winning dish as well!
I remember having Soup de Poisson in Paris and this looks quite similar - maybe my french spelling is not so similar!
Happy New year!
the salmon bisque looks incredibly silky and smooth, I love the pictures
When I saw the gratin, I was jumping for joy! There's a thinly sliced cake in the fridge that I don't know what to do with. And I have pears and blueberries!!! Thanks a lot for this recipe.
Seguo i tuoi post.....come sempre uniche e belissime foto con appetitose ricette!Buon lavoro da Rut
It looks so beautiful and I just want to run my finger through that whipped cream on top of the gratin or is it creme fraiche..whatever it is...yum.
And glad you have someone's GF recipes you *trust* to turn out spot-on..yay for small miracles :)
je suis tentée par la bisque de saumon, un délice
Je te souhaite un beau mercredi
Valérie.
The bisque is now on my list of things to make! And thank you for the suggestion of getting scraps from the fish monger...I have a great one in my town and I always get bones from him to do stock...so salmon scraps are a wonderful idea...that is sparking other ideas like salmon cakes, salmon "burgers" ....the photos, as usual, are stunning. I'm on the waiting list for your spring workshop...keeping my fingers crossed something opens up!
Sounds so cozy and completely delicious!
A Salmon bisque! That's one I've never thought of...sounds (and looks) absolutely delicious! Followed by the most mouthwatering dessert... mmmm!
Thank you!
I'm sorry for the loss of your grandfather, he sounds like an amazing man. I just got your book with a Christmas gift card. I'm loving it!
I. Love. Your. Pictures. They're gorgeous! I'm so sorry to hear about the passing of your grandfather. Your strength and courage at trying time is commendable. I hope you enjoy the rest of your holidays.
Both of these look delicious!
Its look great!I love them!
Wow never had bisque at home before but that looks and sounds delicious!
Definitely want to try the dessert though!!! YUMM!
Those recipes look insanely delicious. Can't wait to try the bisque. Great site by the way.
What a beautiful meal!
Sorry to hear of your loss, best wishes to you and family.
It feels good to be flexible with changing plans. Hope you had fun.
I am now thinking about this soup for New Year Eve's dinner. I will run it by the group and see what they say.
Have a great 2012. I hope it brings you much joy and adventure :)
Gorgeous, Helene. Each recipe looks heavenly. I always choose soup though so I'd aim for that first.
Happy New Year to you and your family.
I bought your Plate to Pixel Book for my hubby {and myself} for Christmas, not even realizing until I got it home that it is your book.
We LOVE it! Awesome information!
Thanks so much!

Thank you for your pictures! C'est un plaisir de les regarder. Je vais commencer la lecture de votre livre pour réussir à faire la parfaite photo! Je regarde votre blog depuis 2008 et avec mon mari nous sommes toujours émerveillés par vos photos culinaires.
Merci pour votre blog et tout notre soutien dans ce moment difficile suite au décès de votre grand-père.
I was feeling down and uninspired...so I came for a visit and as usual felt much better after looking at your gorgeous photos and your beautiful food! Happy Holidays and Best wishes for a fantastic New Year!
Thank you for sharing these recipes. I'll surprise my hubby with with this. Happy New Year!
Gorgeous work. Have a wonderful New year!
I really like the sound of a salmon bisque!
All of your posts and photo's are great. I love your style.
I'm interensted in food styling and food photography from really short time but it's great fun for me and I want to learn more about it. What do you think about organize food photography workshop in Poland? :)
Greetings from Poland.
Agnieszka
Btw.sory for my english skills, but I’m learning still.
Looooving those soup photos!
These recipes sound amazing, I love the idea of a pistachios and pears combined. Following your blog now.
Love the look of the bisque, and I'm addicted to pistachios right now. Fabulous photos, very inspiring. Thanks for sharing! :)
I have never made a fish soup, but your bisque with pureed salmon is an ingenious way to feed fish to those who don't eat fish if it looks like fish. So far my solution has been to chop the fish into tiny pieces and use a lot of dark sauce, not very appetizing, right? ;-) I must try your recipe! And the pear gratin looks gorgeous! I will make them together :-)
Amazing photos! That blue bottle is gorgeous!
I have to tell you that I am reading your wonderful book right now. I am trying to remind myself that I need to learn with my old yucky camera first before I graduate to a better one. Which is good since I can't afford the one I want. Lol! I have so far to go but am so pleased with how far I've come largely due to your inspiration. So thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I am drooling over the tart. Anything with pistachios just shouts my name. Add some currants and I am in heaven. This is really beautiful!
I love your version of salmon bisque. Made it for the second time last night -- delicious! I made one tweak, hate to see the salmon skin go unused, so I crisped it up in a pan with some olive oil and used as a garnish.

Children (of any age) who are tired can not function well. They have continuous meltdowns and temper tantrums. Tired children fight with siblings, can’t pay attention or listen well, and certainly don’t perform to the best of their ability. Think about how you feel when you are tired. Are you short tempered with a short fuse? Are you more emotional? Do you make more mistakes? Those are typical characteristics which come from a lack of sleep. Children are much less equipped to handle everyday life with inadequate sleep. Give your child the gift of sleep. Set him up for success by putting an easy bedtime routine into place, which will provide structure and comfort for your child. Help your child learn how good he can feel with the right amount of sleep. This can be very effective for toddlers through young teens, as long as you provide the tools your child needs. Follow a routine with consistency, every single night, and you will see a remarkable difference in your child’s attitude, as well as his achievements. Read, step-by-step, how to successfully set up a bedtime routine for a child in my syndicated article “Develop a successful bedtime routine“..

Enter Columbia Community Service, an annual fund-raising drive conducted by all the schools in the university, which donates money to more than 50 charitable organizations on the city's Upper West Side -- including senior citizen groups, soup kitchens, after-school programs, athletic leagues and more.
"Thanks to CCS, there was a wonderful, cooperative daycare center called the Red Balloon, which let me work 20 hours a week in my son's classroom to reduce tuition," recalls Bill Baldwin -- that long-ago Ed.D. student, who today is Associate Dean for Academic Administration at TC.
Founded during World War II, CCS kicked off this year's fundraising efforts in November. Because Columbia underwrites all administrative costs, every penny contributed by members of the Columbia community through CCS goes directly to helping beneficiary groups. Last year 49 TC faculty and staff contributed to the campaign; we hope that this year at least twice as many will do so.
"It's an excellent way to make your charitable dollars have an impact locally for those in our neighborhood," says TC Professor Celia Genishi, the College's Director-at-Large for CCS this year. "With all the big charities competing for dollars in the city, the efforts of CCS are critical for those close at hand with the greatest needs."
To donate money to CCS, look for a brochure and donor card in the mail soon; contact Genishi at x3079 with questions.previous page

An Orderly Home Affects Early Literacy Skills, Study Says
By Debra Lau Whelan
Beyond reading to young children, there are other things parents and caregivers can do to help early literacy skills. “Order in the House!” examines the relationship between household chaos, the home literacy environment, maternal reading ability, and children’s early reading—and it concludes that there’s a link between the reading abilities of five- and six-year-olds and the orderliness of their homes.
Household order—characterized by regular bedtime routines, mealtimes, and chores, as well as cleanliness and being able to stay on top of things—has a positive effect on a range of early reading abilities, the report says.
“Don't feel guilty if you want to spend some time organizing your household,” says Anne Martin of
In a sample of 455 kindergarten and first-grade twins, researchers say their findings held true for mothers whose own reading abilities were above the national average. And when the sample was split by a mother’s reading level, household order explained reading growth among children of mothers with above-average reading skills, while the child’s interest in and enjoyment of reading explained reading growth among children of mothers with average reading ability.
Martin notes that perhaps the same mothers who are above-average readers are also those who are more likely to keep a tidy home and to implement daily household routines.
Why do the researchers think household order affects early reading development? “It’s possible that order reflects a more fundamental characteristic of parents, such as conscientiousness, that also affects reading,” Martin says.
Although there have been previous studies evaluating the effects of household chaos and the home literacy environment on child and family wellbeing, this study is the first to test the association between household chaos and early reading development in young school-aged children. (Household noise is defined as using phrases such as, “You can't hear yourself think in our home" and "It's a real zoo in our home." Household chaos is defined as a combination of noise and order.)
The study is also the first to examine whether mothers with high reading ability can moderate the effects of household chaos or early reading.
Past research shows that mothers with better reading skills and higher levels of education have children with better early reading skills. “However, in our sample, we find that mothers' reading ability but not education is associated with children's better reading,” Martin says.
In order to definitively prove that kids from more orderly homes end up with better early literacy skills, the researchers say they need to examine more diverse samples; for example, with kids from less advantaged backgrounds and possibly excluding twins.
Socioeconomic background was also a factor in this study, since the report stressed the importance of whether a child owned more than 30 books, how often the child amused himself with books, and the number of books the child brought home.
The bottom line: Martin advises those trying to advance early reading skills to make books, word or spelling toys, and reading materials available to their children. “Cultivate an interest in reading through role modeling, visits to the library, and finding new and attractive books that are age-appropriate,” she says. “And minimize distractions while you're reading together, and let the child spend time alone with books if he wants to even before he can read.”

This is a beautiful site, having handsome grounds literally across the street (3501 South Lake Drive) from Lake Michigan, which does indeed moderate the weather. The facility itself is entirely self-contained in a series of interconnected buildings, such that we need not fear either killing heat or monsoon. There is ample space available for the conference. We have reserved one entire wing (out of four) for sleeping rooms. Overflow will be no problem. We also have the use of one auditorium of sufficient size to hold the entire projected membership, three additional classrooms for papers, etc., and a lounge ("The Prancing Pony").
Milwaukee has an extensive public transportation grid, and downtown should be easily accessible for $2.00 in bus fares or thereabout. Milwaukee is a large city with a number of attractions; some of these are described in the article by Jan Long that can be found in this Progress Report.
THE TOLKIEN COLLECTION
AT MARQUETTE
Our conference site affords local access to the Marquette University Library Special Collections, and its collection of Tolkien manuscripts. The collection of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien contains the original manuscripts and multiple working drafts for three of the author's most celebrated books, The Hobbit , Farmer Giles of Ham, and The Lord of the Rings, as well as the original copy of the children's book Mr. Bliss (published in facsimile form in 1982). The collection includes books by and about Tolkien, periodicals produced by Tolkien enthusiasts, audio and video recordings, and a host of published and unpublished materials relating to Tolkien's life and fantasy writings.
The original manuscripts represent the heart of the collection. They include holograph renderings (manuscripts in the hand of the author), various sets of typescripts with corrections by Tolkien, and page proofs or galley sheets, also with corrections in the hand of the author. The manuscripts for The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Farmer Giles of Ham, and Mr. Bliss together total over 11,000 pages.
Generous bequests and gifts of books, research papers, and other secondary- material by Tolkien scholars and collectors have contributed immeasurably to the holdings at Marquette. S. Gary Hunnewell, Guest of Honor at this conference, has lent his collection of periodicals produced by Tolkien enthusiasts to Marquette with detailed bibliographic descriptions and indexing for microfilming on a continuing basis. The collection contains many early U.S. and foreign titles, including obscure publications from eastern Europe, as well as selected issues of general fantasy and science fiction " fanzines" relating to Tolkien. Other gifts and bequests include material from Dr. Richard
Blackwelder and the late Taum Santoski.

VERO BEACH — Dodgertown Elementary will close at the end of this year, with Osceola Magnet School moving to the facility on 43rd Avenue, under a recommendation by Schools Superintendent Fran Adams.
The recommendation still needs approval by the Indian River County School Board. The board is scheduled to vote on the proposal at its Tuesday meeting.
If approved by the board, current Dodgertown students would be rezoned and reassigned for the fall.
The board and district has talked about relocating Osceola, which is prone to flooding after heavy rains, for years. Until last month, the board planned to move Osceola to Pointe West, on a parcel donated by the development. But at a Nov. 13 workshop, the board discussed other options, including the Dodgertown proposal. Dodgertown, built in 1967 at 4350 43rd Ave., Vero Beach, has had dwindling enrollment, Adams said at the workshop last month.
Moving Osceola to Dodgertown would cost about $10.5 million. The cost includes building a new wing at Treasure Coast and Citrus elementary schools.
Sam7 writes:
Why not just incorporate Osceola into VBE the brand new school not even finished yet? This school board not only does not care about expenses, it obviously knows how to waste money too. Last year you closed a perfectly viable school, resulting in over-crowding and resdistricting some of the other elementary schools, now you want to bus the children that go to Osceola to Dogertown? I would love to know what is really behind this proposal.
OMSparent writes:
An insult to all parties. Poor planning proves poor performance by the Superintendent. Last minute decisions of this magnitude rarely turn out well.
RealDeal writes:
The true story needs to come out on this issue......we can hope that the School Board members have a true long term vision to this issue. The idea of moving from one out of date school to another does not support our children and a big picture fix.
sebasdad27 writes:
I'm not sure if the School Board intends on destroying the, successful, magnet school program we have in IRC but moving OMS to Dogertown would certainly be a step in that direction. They tried to change Thompson to a magnet and we all know how that turned out. A move to Dogertown will require a massive redistricting of our elementary age children. Most families in the county will be affected.
The school should have been under construction months ago at Pointe West as was already planned for, payed for and directed by the board. The Pointe West location is ready to be built on, plans are already in place, and this move will not adversely impact nearly as many students and families.
By the way, do you really think this administration can have 2 new wings built at different elementary schools a renovation of the Dogertown facility and a redistricting of all elementary students in the county by next fall? They haven't even drawn up the plans for the new wings or given true cost estimates.
Come on School Board, lets use some common sense here.

I haven't checked my facts admitted---could this have something to do with DTE not making AYP?

il_Polipo writes:
This or the Waterway Village property are the only options to keep Osceola as a true magnet school. Going to Pointe West means giving that developer 25% of the seats at Osceola which limits the chances of all the other county parents getting their kid in to Osceola. To the racists: moving to Gifford will not destroy the school. All the beach kids go to Gifford Middle and many other parents try to make sure their kids get to go to Gifford Middle instead of Oslo, Sebastian or Storm Grove. You can't look at Thompson as a precursor to what might happen. It was a completely different set of circumstances. Maybe the best option would be to build a new school at Waterway and CONVERT Dodgertown to the county administration offices they desperately need but cannot afford to build.
MainlandMama writes:
I still think the best option is to move to Dodgertown as cheaply as possible, then fix the drainage problems at Osceola and build a BASIC magnet school there when/if Dodgertown is needed again.
OMSparent writes:
True Believer - I believe your issue with student access at the proposed Pointe West site is off the mark. There are currently 55 K-5 students living in Pointe West. 22 are renters and are not eligible based on the current agreement. Of the 33 eligible students, 10 already attend Osceola. If all 22 remaining students did apply, at most 15 would get in and that's assuming that each grade level had already met the required desegregation order. This would not have a significant effect on the access of other county children.
sebasdad27 writes:
Rebuilding at the current OMS location is not a possibility as stated by the administration. I find it appalling that the administration has given no thought to fixing the problems at Dogertown, only to move those students out and replace them with OMS students. Where's the outrage from all the parents who will have to deal with their children having to leave their friends and start new in a different school. This will not only happen to Dogertown, but all elementary schools except Fellsmere Elementary.
The facts remain. The administration has not shown the actual costs for a move to Dogertown, they have no real plans or cost for the expansion of other schools to accommodate the move, and they have not fully explained the impact on the overall population of elementary students in the county. This project is ready to go, payed for, and approved by the school board to be constructed at the Pointe West location. Lets not drag this along any further based upon possibilities and maybe's. Lets go with the facts and get OMS built at Pointe West.

Money is no object! The Board is also a private leasing corporation able to borrow money by issuing bonds oh! and you have no sayso over the matter. They do this without voter approval. They have borrowed over $250,000,000 since `05 and will borrow more. Wake up folks! They will not use common sense being they have unfettered access to your wallet.Check the budget and you will see the debt service is about $21,000,000. It will only get worse.

That is right debt service $21,000,000 a year and it is out to 2027 or longer if they continue to borrow more. deficit spending you have to love it. Wash.D.C. is doing the same. How is that working out for you?

Honestly, I see both sides to this argument. However, the comments I’ve read on TCPalm seem to be lacking a lot of factual information. AYP has not been met by the majority of Indian River County schools, even the beloved and “perfect” Osceola Magnet. In addition, the school has to not make AYP for CONSECUTIVE years. Dodgertown has not been a Title 1 school for CONSECUTIVE years. Also, the school board pointed out that there has been a decline in Dodgertown’s enrollment over the past years. Well, obviously this would happen as a result of the county constructing Treasure Coast Elementary and Liberty Magnet and re-zoning neighborhoods. Magnet schools have made this county’s schools completely separated. We now have 3 Magnet schools and I think 5 Title 1 schools. Doesn’t anyone see what has happened? It’s ridiculous to think that people actual look at teachers and/or schools and blame them for what has happened. Look around people! Times have changed; half the kids in today’s schools don’t have both parents around and/or know who their mom/dad is. Yet day after day they enroll in free preschool programs provided by the state and food money provided by us tax payers and the teachers are left to deal with the kids who have no consequences at home and no parental involvement. Did anyone ever stop to think that MAYBE this is WHY it is so difficult for some teachers and schools to even do their job? Just a thought… Adams and the other school board members can say what they want but as far as I am concerned, this has been in the works for years. Why build a brand new cafeteria last year and the current work on the buildings going on now. It will be interesting to see how much community input the board allows at the meeting. My guess is … none. With all that said…. I’m still curious as to why it costs over 4 million dollars to “convert” ( word used on the slideshow) the current school campus. If it’s good enough to house 400+ students and the teachers now it should be just fine to teach the students at Osceola. Oh wait, as someone else mentioned on a comment “the program at Osceola deems necessary changes”… Why are they better than the other students in ANY of the elementary schools in this county. Ugh. Politics.

INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — The county could be looking for a new tenant for the former Dodgertown facility as soon as next month, after contract negotiations came to an impasse with the partnership now operating Vero Beach Sports Village.
In a letter dated Feb. 5, Vero Beach Sports Village Vice President Craig Callan notified Indian River County Administrator Joe Baird the Verotown LLC partners will not be exercising their option to renew their contract, which ends in May 2014.
Sports Village officials would like a new five-year deal once the current lease expires, but they are no further along after six months of contractual discussions with the county.
“We’re continuing to fine tune what we feel is a reasonable offer to the county, but to our disappointment, our offer has not been accepted,” Callan said.
County Commissioner Peter O’Bryan said he expects the county to request proposals next month to see what other groups might be interested in taking over operation of the facility. But the door is still open for a new deal with Verotown LLC.
Minor League Baseball signed the original lease, which began May 1, 2009, and contained two five-year options for renewal, but MiLB began operating the facility as part of the Verotown LLC on Jan. 1, 2012. The partnership is made up of former Dodgers owner Peter O’Malley and his sister Terry O’Malley Seidler, former Dodgers pitchers Hideo Nomo and Chan Ho Park and Minor League Baseball. O’Malley is the CEO.
“It doesn’t hurt to send out a request for proposals to see who else might be interested,” said O’Bryan.
According to Callan and O’Bryan, there are two sticking points.
Under the current lease, the county contributes to a reserve fund for capital expenditures, which Sports Village officials would like to see continued and the county at the very least wants to limit.
Callan said Sports Village officials put together a projection of capital expenditures for the next five years, but the county said those numbers were too high, so Sports Village officials pared them, but still couldn’t reach an agreement. Callan said the partners could not go below $200,000 a year.
The lease also requires a $300,000 liquidated damages fee if Verotown LLC were to leave early, with or without advance notice. Callan said the operating partners wanted in the new contract to instead guarantee at least four months’ notice and remove the liquidated damages penalty.
Indian River County budget director Jason Brown said the liquidated damages provision is the main concern for the county.
“We don’t want to go and spend more money on the facility, and then have Verotown decide it’s just not working and walk away without penalty,” Brown said. “If we are going to spend more taxpayer dollars on the facility, we want some protection on any tenant leaving, and we think the liquidated damages provides that.”
Callan said the partners thought four months’ notice would be a “better than even trade” because it would save the county operating costs while giving it time to find a new tenant.
According to Callan, O’Malley was concerned about the capital expenditures becoming the operating partners’ responsibility. They lease the facility for $1 a year but do not have ownership of the property.
“As much as we are willing to continue and preserve the historical significance of Dodgertown, Peter O’Malley also is not interested in having significant losses that aren’t ours,” Callan said. “If we were to be responsible for capital expenditures, it’s not our facility. If we were to ever leave, it’s not our asset, so our feeling is we should not be paying for and never have paid for capital expenditures. We just want it to be status quo as it has in the past.”
According to county officials, the current agreement set up a fund of more than $2 million for capital expenditures, and about $1.2 million of it has been spent. At the beginning of year six, the leasee was to match a local government contribution of $50,000 annually to replenish the account, but Verotown would be responsible for any expenditures above that.
Brown said the county is willing to work with Verotown on that issue if the liquidated damages penalty is in place.
Callan said the Sports Village has not made any profits yet since opening in May 2009, but operating losses have been cut by 50 percent each year, gradually going from $1 million the first year to $250,000 losses in the third year. The partnership is responsible for maintenance and upkeep that has been estimated to be $150,000 a month.
The group hopes to break even this year and eventually turn a profit, but Callan said O’Malley has offered as part of the new contract discussions to reinvest any future profits back into the county-owned facility.
A recent study released by the Treasure Coast Sports Commission estimated the Sports Village had a more than $21 million economic impact on Indian River County between December 2009 and Nov. 1, 2012.
“With the things we’ve done in the community, with the things we’ve done to improve the facility, with the impact we’ve had on the local economy on a year-round basis, we think we’re doing all the right things, so we can’t understand why we have not been able to come to an agreement,” Callan said.
Callan said O’Malley has no interest in moving elsewhere, but if the partners don’t feel like they will ever reach an agreement with the county, they could decide to pull out early and just pay the $300,000.
Several projects are on hold, such as getting the rights to the name Historic Dodgertown and bringing in a national marketer to build exposure.
“The whole idea for Peter O’Malley wasn’t to build a business that would work elsewhere,” Callan said. “This is a labor of love. ... If we are not able to come to terms with the county, we’ll go by the letter of the contract, so it would be up to the county — either the contract is terminated or it runs out.”
County attorney Alan Polackwich said he hasn’t personally been involved in discussions with the partnership about the lease since last year, but he is going to try to put the issue before the County Commission as early as March 5.
Polackwich said there has been some general discussions with other parties that might be interested in the facility, but Callan said he hasn’t heard anything back from the county since delivering notice of the nonrenewal.
“Our vision is growing, and we told the county if they don’t share our vision, if they feel they have a better option, we’ll gratefully step aside,” Callan said.

The Dodgers are long gone.
snoozy writes:
This has been a longtime coming and is not unexpected. It is time to move this public owned facility either forward with another organization or sell it outright. Vero Beach Sports Village under the current management has had five years, with millions of dollars from the public to put this operation in the black and the leasing of the property to a sister organization will not make it any better. There has to be a major change in the management and scope of operations, not a return to a situation which has not been viable for many years.
THe public will have somewhere between $35-$40 million in the Sports Complex including bonding costs, operation subsidies, improvements, and purchases. That is a lot of money for a county with only 130-140 thousand residents.
The commission should not be supporting this operation any longer, like any deal it has to stand on its own legs. It is time to market and advertise the availability and see who comes forward and is willing to have some real skin (dollars) in the deal.

Kind of like the Dodgers did. Nothing new here.

Where did VBSV get millions of dollars? VBSV has pumped millions into a facility that was sitting empty after the Dodgers left and costing the County(taxpayers) over $100,000 per month to just sit there. Isn't it nice to have someone operating the place and putting tax dollars into the coffers, not to mention the increase in bed taxes. And ask the waitstaff around town how they like the increase in tips from all of the customers that wouldn't be here if VBSV weren't operating.

Good point and the hotel and restaurant revenue its generated is not even in the ballpark to make sense for the taxpayers to continue funding this thing through higher taxes. This situation would only make sense if their was a bunch of other revenue coming in from other uses also and there isn't.

lol- Heck using that reasoning lets build more taxpayer funded operations so we can create even more server tips and hotel fees. Maybe we can tax ourself into full employment with that kind of reasoning.

John22 - it's investment. There is a return on what happens at the facility, city and county wide. I guess we could just stay with giving groves a tax break and solve our unemployment with picking fruit.

Lets see the CERTIFIED AUDIT that was required in the original lease. It will tell where the money came from and went. The commissioners have never held Vero Beach Sports Village to that requirement.
I wonder why.
snoozy writes:
My original comments have been made for only one reason. So that the taxpayers are provided with an representative certified audit and then a decision to proceed can be made. There is no other negative reasoning beyond keeping the public apprised of the money spent and the future costs to be expected. CoachDawg is right it should be treated as an investment, but it should stand on its own legs and return more than a small percentage of funds invested to the taxpayers. I wonder what happens to the sports television rights profits, I have heard that they trickle back to minor league baseball and its parent major league baseball. These guys don't need the taxpayers money just look at what they are paying for players, and the Indian River County taxpayers don't need to subsidize these millionaires. Why doesn't a few dozen of these retired ball players put in some serious bucks and buy the place from the taxpayers and make it a showcase. They have the money, connections and know how. It was totally a privately supported operation when it was owned by the Dodgers.
ConchDawg writes:
sports television rights? what they are paying players? and the millions of dollars "given" to VBSV? Snoozy, remember Roseanne Roseannadanna, this is where you say "Oh Nevermind!" You still think the Dodgers are involved. They are not. And oh by the way, it's illegal to smoke that stuff.

NO ONE IS PAYING PLAYERS!!!! This is not the Dodgers. The Dodgers are gone! There are high school and college kids and international teams playing there. Playing baseball, softball, football, soccer, lacrosse, swim teams. This is a business that brings in people from all over the country and the world to little ole Vero Beach and these people bring MONEY!!!!

Conchdawg seems to have an IN with this, or is one of the management of the facility. I have to lean toward agreeing with him on some points. There are college and young adults from all over the world that come to our little town. They pay good money to come, and spend good money while they are here. What is the future of these persons coming back to Vero as adults and raising families? Nobody really knows. However, there are annual trips that teams are preparing for, to our town, because of this venue, and they tell others about it. That should shed a little light about the future. Is the purchase of the facility an option? There are ball players, and other league officials who make a substantial amount of money each game as professionals, who may be interested in partnering up for a purchase. Again, is it an option? I have seen leases and negotiations, but nothing mentioning a purchase. I do think that if the county commission thinks that a different venue should be feasable to come in and run the park, that they should consider the future growth of all the amazing talent that has came to this facility. Now, with that being said, the only time I have personally been to the Village since the Dodgers left, was for the Jake Owen concert. Us Vero Beach residents, do not know what is going on at the facility, so we do not attend, and get a better picture of the positive or negative outcomes of the facility. If an agreement is made, a sign out by 43rd Ave would be nice to inform the general what is happening, and when the public is invited to attend. Not getting off the subject, but I would hope that an agreement would be settled. After 5 years of finally making a positive impact at that location, it would be a shame to have all these annual trips and big tournaments, be taken elsewhere. St Lucie is trying to bring in a second team....and we cant figure out if we want any teams at all ?? I think over the next few years, a sharp decrease in taxpayer liability should go to zero, making the Village self-sufficient, and rent should be paid, just as every other business. We gave Piper a heck of a break, for many years to come, why cant we play this out for a few more years, and see what is in store for us. It will definitely be better than sitting empty.
snoozy writes:
ConchDawg, why don't you ask to follow the money, the reason for the audit request, that is the least the taxpayers deserve.
The remarks about smoking something obviously is your way of insulting others when you don't agree with their comments. It reflects on you more than the person to which you are directing the comment.
The proposed lease sounds like a long term giveaway of tax payers dollars. The gravy train has to stop and lets hope it is now. If they don't want to invest the money to do this deal than the county should go find someone who does.
The county cannot afford to continue funding this operation. Mr. Callan has been employed at this location for many, many years, long before the Sports Village, Minor League Baseball lease. He should be able to put together a group with enough money to buy the property and take it forward.
It is time for some new blood to purchase the property and the taxpayers shouldn't be funding this any longer.
John22 writes:
Imo its like that past Piper deal - the returns aren't close to matching the costs to taxpayers. Numbers can be thrown around about economic impact but the number that needs to be scrutinized is what have the taxpayers funded compared to the extra the place brings in to help the county tax bill. Gross numbers on economic impact are always misleading and meant to mislead people usually on the cost to taxpayers of something.

Theres breaking news for you. Another deal negotiated by
"Vertigo" Joe Baird goes sour! WHO KNEW?
Remember when he lobbied for Piper to stay and had everyone, including the State of FL, throwing money at their feet.
And that was a good deal...why?
When will the county "get it" that Baird is a far cry from King Midas? His contract is the one that should never be renewed again! Arrogant, over rated, overpaid, drunk son of a .....

The county has proven to be a lousy property owner and business manager. And anyone who thinks there are other groups who would jump into a business relationship with those knuckleheads is just fooling themselves.
Solution? Sell the facility to the O'Malley group for $10. They own it, they maintain it, put in the capital investment and pay taxes on it.
If you think the place would bring more, then auction it with no reserve, no minimum. And good luck with that.
VBRetired writes:
Vero Beach city government is about to get out of the electric power business and it is, likewise, time to get out of ball park business. Government should not be running businesses. Business revenue goes into lots of "deep pockets" while the taxpayers continue to get ripped-off and stuck with the debt.
ConchDawg writes:
Television rights? What channel? I'd like to watch. Name a player being paid. Comments such as that indicate lack of knowledge of the situation or deception or loss of lucidity.
snoozy writes:
ConchDawg, I believe Minor League Baseball, the organization which owns Vero Beach Sport Village has an agreement regarding television rights with Major League Baseball. That may possibly be why there is no ESPN and other sports network participation on the location.
The location cannot return the moneys needed without some kind of television revenue (that is what keeps most sports profitable) and it also can't depend on only being a high school sports or occasional college training facility.
The uses need to be expanded to bring in more customers and more revenue. If minor or major league baseball wants to participate fine, but other multiple revenue sources will have to be developed. Have private industry expand the economic pie. There has to be other large organizations which would like to have a presence in the Sports business besides the usual baseball related companies.

If only we had a professional leader for county administrator; one whose competence includes negotiating skills, as well as effective leadership skills, we would not be having this discussion.

ConchDawg writes:
Minor League Baseball does not own VBSV.
You stated: "The location cannot return the moneys needed without some kind of television revenue" Not sure what data you used to arrive at that personal conclusion.
There is more than high school and college. Professional teams from South Korea, Italy and China train there.
Many sports teams from all over the USA and Canada representing football, soccer, lacrosse and swimming train there.
Nice to have the Girls State Softball Tournament there for the next three years. Thank you Treasure Coast Sports Commission for helping to secure that influx of tourist dollars into the local economy, and during a usually slow period.
The ownership is preserving an historic facility that was sitting empty for months after the Dodgers left (and costing the county a lot of money) while at the same time driving substantial dollars into the local economy. They have even stated they will put profits back into a facility they don't even own!!!
It really is a win-win.

Are you people numb in Vero. You hardly spent any money when the Dodgers were there. It was like a large Little League field. No covering on the dugouts? Amateur fields and amateur leadership which prevails. Luck paying for cutting the grass on the empty fields. Nobody's going to develop anything there you numb nutz!
perspicacious writes:
So far - no profits! This is more corporate favoritism. Several years ago Callan reported that they couldn't make a profit without taxpayer support. What kind of business plan is THAT? If you can't make a profit without my tax money then you shouldn't be in business. We can't afford this! And to think VBSV wants money for improvements. NO! They should sign a long-term lease, improve the property, and the improvements should revert to the County in 30 years. This is how the airport leases work.
I agree - sell the property and put it back on the tax rolls.....
VBRetired writes:
Why do some people want Vero Beach to grow? What's wrong with a sleepy little town tucked away from commerce and traffic jams. Most people moved here to get far from the madding crowd. City Council wants to destroy taxpayers dreams of quiet retirement??? What gives? Must mean money in the pockets of those controlling the tax dollars....

Instead of the City of Vero dreaming up businesses to support, why not just give our tax dollars directly to your friends and get rid of the smoke and mirrors.

Goodbye Callan. You may gratefully step aside. We no longer wish for you to siphon our tax dollars. COVB it's time for you to sell the property and get out of Sports Village business.

Regardless of political affiliation, this summary explains the federal government’s budget and predicament.
The fiscal cliff put in a much better perspective:
Lesson No. 1
• U.S. tax revenue: $2,170,000,000,000
• Federal budget: $3,820,000,000,000
• New debt: $1,650,000,000,000
• National debt: $14,271,000,000,000
• Recent budget cuts: $38,500,000,000
Let us now remove eight zeros and pretend it is a household budget:
• Annual family income: $21,700
• Money the family spent: $38,200
• New debt on the credit card: $16,500
• Outstanding balance on the credit card: $142,710
• Total budget cuts so far: $38.50
Got it? OK, now consider this.
Lesson No. 2
Another way to look at the debt ceiling:
Say you come home from work and find there has been a sewer backup in your neighborhood. Now your home has sewage all the way up to your ceilings. What do you think you should do? Raise the ceilings, or remove the sewage? Author: Unknown

We publish books on management skills, self-development, customer care, and all aspects of business and management (see Titles: A-Z List). We also have a fast-growing list of pocketbooks for teachers, the award-winning Teachers' Pocketbooks Series.
You can use our Pocketbooks as self-development and learning aids or for training purposes. Written using accelerated learning techniques, the books are ideal for continuing professional development. There are over 100 different titles to choose from.
Popular subjects covered include: motivation, conflict resolution, mentoring, emotional intelligence, coaching, project management, leadership, NLP, time management, facilitation, managing change, teamworking, performance management and empowerment.
Our books are very different, and not just because they are pocket-size (more on this later). Imagine an overhead slide, the sort that trainers frequently use: keywords, bullet-point lists and lots of visual support. Our Pocketbooks are very similar. We strip away all the superfluous information, the padding, and present just the key facts. It cuts down on reading and saves valuable time.
The visual content (charts, diagrams and cartoons) helps with understanding and, along with the many acronyms, mnemonics and other 'triggers', aids memory retention and recall. See for yourself just how stimulating the approach is by viewing a short extract from any one of our titles (Book extracts).
Information that is easily accessible is central to our publishing philosophy. Each page has its own subject heading and each chapter has its own graphic identifier or thumb logo. In this way you can get to the specific bit of information you're looking for quickly and easily - ideal for a quick glance just before an important meeting, interview, presentation or telephone call.
Because they are so small, Pocketbooks have the advantage of being very portable. This encourages people to keep their copies close to hand and refer to them regularly - better, surely, than books sitting on a shelf and largely forgotten.
'The Management Pocketbook series is fantastic', stated a report in Business and Computer Bookseller. 'To coin a phrase - they're great!' reported Training Education Employment magazine.
We have two types of customer. There are those who buy copies for their own use and those - trainers, HR professionals, managers, team leaders and others - who buy multiple copies for distribution to team members, to those attending training workshops and seminars, and to all key members of staff. We give good discounts for this purpose (see Discounts).
We know from the high levels of repeat business and referrals that the Pocketbook format is popular. We are grateful to our many loyal customers, for their business, for their valuable feedback and for passing on the good words. We hope you too will soon become a Pocketbook convert. We feel confident that you'll be completely satisfied but, if not, we'll take our books back without hesitation (see Refund Guarantee).
Thank you for visiting us here at Management Pocketbooks and good luck with your quest for authoritative, accessible and affordable information on training, HRD, personal development and all aspects of business and management.

Teaching has been a passion of mine since I was a teacher's helper in
elementary school. In 1999, I graduated from the University of Miami with a
Bachlors in Psychology and Special Education. For the past 12 years, I have
taught children as well as adults. I have been teaching Reading and Language
Arts for over 3 years at Mater Academy and I enjoy opening students minds to
adventures in reading.
There is no job better than teaching. Each day is different, and
children are a constant source of amazement. They are fun to work with, and
watching them learn and grow is extremely rewarding.
I am a wife and mother of three. My sons are 4 and 11. Baseball is a
big deal to them right now. My daughter is 6 and she loves to dance and
listen to music. I enjoy reading, traveling, and spending time with my
family.
To all of you parents...THANK YOU for allowing me the privilege of
working with your child this year. As we become partners in your child's life
for this school year, let's work as a team to make this one of the BEST
experiences ever. Together, we can help your child develop a genuine love of
reading for the years to come!

Objective:
Teaching vocabulary through music
Resources:
Recorded children's music, written words for
songs, pictures depicting vocabulary in song.
Teacher Preparation:
Collect pictures for pocket chart of the nouns/concepts that illustrate
the song you have chosen. I use picture dictionaries and scan the pictures.
This way you will have pictures of uniform size. Write the words for the
song on sentence strips. Make a half sheet song booklet for the children
that has a line or few lines from the song on each page, that can be illustrated
by the children.
Procedure:
The steps of the procedure can be spread out over a
week or several days. I choose a song a week that ties in with our reading
program. Show each pocket chart picture to the children and discuss,act
out, or otherwise teach the vocabulary for the song. Children can match
the words to the pictures if appropriate for your group. Play the song,
act out the words, discuss meaning. Repeat this procedure each day for
one week. On Friday, give the children the song booklet you have prepared.
Have your pocket chart available to which students may refer. Children
illustrate each page of the booklet (Teach what "illustrate" means, insist
that the picture "shows what the words say." Regroup and let children
share some of their illustrations. Sing the song once more; this time
students refer to their booklets. Children can then place their booklet
in the "revisiting" basket, or take home to share with their families,
Variations/Options:
You may want to teach your group how to look up the vocabulary in picture
dictionaries.
Real World Usage:
Younger children could use pictures only. Have them each hold a picture
card and put themselves in correct order as the class sings the song.
Have them illustrate a few words from the song, rather than giving them
the whole song. Tie it in with your handwriting, spelling and sight word
vocabulary.

The atom's nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, which are much more massive than electrons. When an element has atoms that differ in the number of neutrons, these atoms are called different isotopes of the element. 178 B (9-12))
Atoms interact with one another by transferring or sharing electrons that are furthest from the nucleus. These outer electrons govern the chemical properties of the element. 178 B (9-12))
The physical properties of compounds reflect the nature of the interactions among its molecules. These interactions are determined by the structure of the molecule, including the constituent atoms and the distances and angles between them. 179 B (9-12))
Carbon atoms can bond to one another in chains, rings, and branching networks to form a variety of structures, including synthetic polymers, oils, and the large molecules essential to life. 179 B (9-12). 154 B (5-8)
If more than one force acts on an object along a straight line, then the forces will reinforce or cancel one another, depending on their direction and magnitude. Unbalanced forces will cause changes in the speed or direction of an object's motion. 154 B (5-8)
Energy is a property of many substances and is associated with heat, light, electricity, mechanical motion, sound, nuclei, and the nature of a chemical. Energy is transferred in many ways. 155 B (5-8)
Heat moves in predictable ways, flowing from warmer objects to cooler ones, until both reach the same temperature. 155 B (5-8)
Light interacts with matter by transmission (including refraction), absorption, or scattering (including reflection). To see an object, light from that object--emitted by or scattered from it--must enter the eye. 155 B (5-8)
Electrical circuits provide a means of transferring electrical energy when heat, light, sound, and chemical changes are produced. 155 B (5-8)
Objects have many observable properties, including size, weight, shape, color, temperature, and the ability to react with other substances. These properties can be measured using tools such as rulers, balances, and thermometers. 127 B (K-4). 127 B (K-4)
The position of an object can be described by locating it relative to another object or the background.
An object's motion can be described by tracing and measuring its position over time. 127 B (K-4)
The position and motion of objects can be changed by pushing or pulling. The size of the change is related to the strength of the push or pull. 127 B (K-4)
Sound is produced by vibrating objects. The pitch of the sound can be varied by changing the rate of vibration. 127 B (K-4)
Light travels in a straight line until it strikes an object. Light can be reflected by a mirror, refracted by a lens, or absorbed by the object. 127 B (K-4)
Heat can be produced in many ways such as burning, rubbing, and mixing one substance with another. Heat can move from one object to another by conduction. 127 B (K-4)
Electricity in circuits can produce light, heat, sound, and magnetic effects. Electrical circuits require a complete loop through which an electrical current can pass. 127 B (K-4). 184 C (9-12). 184 C (9-12)
Cells store and use information to guide their functions. The genetic information stored in DNA is used to direct the synthesis of the thousands of proteins that each cell requires. 184 C (9-12)
Cell functions are regulated. Regulation occurs both through changes in the activity of the functions performed by proteins and the selective expression of individual genes. This regulation allows cells to respond to their environment and to control and coordinate the synthesis and breakdown of specific molecules, cell growth and division. 184 C . 184 C (9-12). 184 C (9-12). 185 C (9-12). 185 C (9-12)
Changes in DNA (mutations) occur spontaneously at low rates. Some of these changes make no difference to the organism, whereas others can change cells and organisms. Only mutations in germ cells can create the variation that changes an organism's offspring. 185 C (9-12). 185 C (9-12)
Living systems at all levels of organization demonstrate the complementary nature of structure and function. Important levels of organization for structure and function include cells, organs, tissues, organ systems, whole organisms, and ecosystems. 156 C (5-8)
All organisms are composed of cells--the fundamental unit of life. Most organisms are single cells; other organisms, including humans, are multicellular. 156 C (5-8)
Cells carry on the many functions needed to sustain life. They grow and divide, thereby producing more cells. This requires that they take in nutrients, which they use to provide energy for the work that cells do and to make the materials that a cell or an organism needs. 156 C . 156 C (5-8)
The human organism has systems for digestion, respiration, reproduction, circulation, excretion, movement, control and coordination, and for protection from disease. These systems interact with one another. 156 C (5-8)
Disease is a breakdown in structures or functions of an organism. Some diseases are the result of intrinsic failures of the system. Others are the result of damage by infection by other organisms. 157 C (5-8)
Reproduction is a characteristic of all living systems; because no individual organism lives forever, reproduction is essential to the continuation of every species. Some organisms reproduce asexually. Other organisms reproduce sexually. 157 C (5-8)
In many species, including humans, females produce eggs and males produce sperm. Plants also reproduce sexually--the egg and sperm are produced in the flowers of flowering plants. An egg and sperm unite to begin the development of a new individual. That new individual receives genetic information from its mother (via the egg) and its father (via the sperm). Sexually produced offspring never are identical to either of their parents. 157 C (5-8)
Every organism requires a set of instructions for specifying its traits. Heredity is the passage of these instructions from one generation to another. 157 C (5-8). 157 C (5-8)
Organisms have basic needs. For example, animals need air, water, and food; plants require air, water, nutrients, and light. Organisms can survive only in environments in which their needs can be met. The world has many different environments, and distinct environments support the life of different types of organisms. 129 C (K-4)
Each plant or animal has different structures that serve different functions in growth, survival, and reproduction. For example, humans have distinct body structures for walking, holding, seeing, and talking. 129 C (K-4)
The behavior of individual organisms is influenced by internal cues (such as hunger) and by external cues (such as a change in the environment). Humans and other organisms have senses that help them detect internal and external cues. 129 C (K-4)
Plants and animals have life cycles that include being born, developing into adults, reproducing, and eventually dying. The details of this life cycle are different for different organisms. 129 C (K-4)
Plants and animals closely resemble their parents. 129 C (K-4)
Many characteristics of an organism are inherited from the parents of the organism, but other characteristics result from an individual's interactions with the environment. Inherited characteristics include the color of flowers and the number of limbs of an animal. Other features, such as the ability to ride a bicycle are learned through interactions with the environment and cannot be passed on to the next generation. 129 C (K-4)
All animals depend on plants. Some animals eat plants for food. Other animals eat animals that eat the plants. 129 C (K-4). 129 C (K-4)
All organisms cause changes in the environment where they live. Some of these changes are detrimental to the organism or other organisms, whereas others are beneficial. 129 C (K-4)
Humans depend on their natural and constructed environment. Humans change environments in ways that can either be beneficial or detrimental for themselves and other organisms. 129 C (K-4). 189 D (9-12)
Heating of earth's surface and atmosphere by the sun drives convection within the atmosphere and oceans, producing winds and ocean currents. 189 D (9-12)
Global climate is determined by energy transfer from the sun at and near the earth's surface. This energy transfer is influenced by dynamic processes such as cloud cover and the earth's rotation, and static conditions such as the position of mountain ranges and oceans. 189 D (9-12)
The earth is a system containing essentially a fixed amount of each stable chemical atom or element. Each element can exist in several different chemical reservoirs. Each element on earth moves among reservoirs in the solid earth, oceans, atmosphere, and organisms as part of geochemical cycles. 189 D (9-12) sun, the earth, and the rest of the solar system formed from a nebular cloud of dust and gas 4.6 billion years ago. The early earth was very different from the planet we live on today. 189 D (9-12)
Geologic time can be estimated by observing rock sequences and using fossils to correlate the sequences at various locations. Current methods include using the known decay rates of radioactive isotopes present in rocks to measure the time since the rock was formed. 189 D . 189 D (9-12)
Evidence for one-celled forms of life--the bacteria--extends back more than 3.5 billion years. The evolution of life caused dramatic changes in the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, which did not originally contain oxygen. 190 D (9-12)
The solid Earth is layered with a lithosphere; hot, convecting mantle; and dense, metallic core. 159 D (5-8)
Global patterns of atmospheric movement influence local weather. Oceans have a major effect on climate, because water in the oceans holds a large amount of heat. 160 D (5-8)
Living organisms have played many roles in the earth system, including affecting the composition of the atmosphere, producing some types of rocks, and contributing to the weathering of rocks. 160 D (5-8)
Lithospheric plates on the scales of continents and oceans constantly move at rates of centimeters per year in response to movements in the mantle. Major geological events, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building, result from these plate motions. 160 D (5-8)
Land forms are the result of a combination of constructive and destructive forces. Constructive forces include crustal deformation, volcanic eruption, and deposition of sediment, while destructive forces include weathering and erosion. 160 D (5-8)

I am about to have my new British Heritage body painted but I have couple of
questions for anybody who has done this before. My painting shop wants to
paint all the panels, doors and hoods off the shell. In restorations I have
seen in the past, the seams on the rear quarter panels seemed as if they were
painted on the shell, ie there were no gaps or unpainted seams. The same
appearance is seen in the front body panels on the lower side by the turn
signal. If these panels are painted off the shell, how are those seams
sealed? I have seen these areas rust out quickly in two other restorations.
Thanks in advance.

I agree here. Someone standing outside the car while you do this
would notice the wheels turn more slowly when you engage, yet the
engine maintains the same RPM. In real life this would not happen or
the car would thrust the occupants forward as it rapidly decelerates.
Put the wheels on the ground so they spin with a constant velocity,
and the other end (motor) turns more slowly when you engage, leaving
the occupants stationary to enjoy greater fuel economy.

Listers,
Anyone know of a reputable person who can successfully recondition a
gearbox, plus overdrive, for a TR4A?
I am looking for someone preferably in Texas, as that is where the
gearbox is located.
I don't mind taking on the engine myself, but not the gearbox. Those
damned things have wheels inside of wheels!!
BTW, front brakes are completed and back on the car. I'll update the
site soon and send everyone a notice
Peace be with you!

Minor points: you can't change controls and there is indeed a very small hickup when using the outside view. But that's hardly noticable.
Now Milestone hurry up with the free DLC!
Since its launch earlier this year, the PlayStation Vita has been largely devoid of decent driving games. Sure, there’s the obligatory Ridge Racer to provide that thin slice of nourishing, easy to digest arcade action, but aside from a shoddy 3DS port of F1 2011 there’s been little in the way of serious, deep pan driving games.
Enter WRC3, which, as the title suggests, aims to fully replicate Milestone’s rally simulation on Sony’s struggling handheld system..
But don’t just take our word for it. During our visit to Milestone, we were able to record some video to bring you the first ever footage of WRC3 on Vita in action:
From my first hands-on, I was genuinely surprised by how closely WRC3 on Vita resembled its big brothers. Visually, WRC3 looks superb on the Vita’s crystal clear screen - all the bells and whistles of Spike Engine have remained largely intact, sporting a similar level of track detail and lavish lighting techniques. It all ran at a steady 30 frames per second, too, perfectly capturing WRC3's enthralling sense of speed. I did encounter a few instances of slowdown during some of the intermissions before and after the rally however, but it remained solid throughout my playthrough.
It’s not quite identical, though. But minor quibbles such as less prominent reflections and small sacrifices to the track texture details aside, WRC3 looks every bit as good as it does on PS3, which is a testament to the capabilities of the preposterously powerful PS Vita.
Milestone’s Head of Development and Technologies and Lead Physics Programmer Stefano Lecchi explains exactly how the graphics were altered: “The rendering required some reduction in texture and material quality since the Vita has a little less power than the consoles, so we needed to remove some objects from the tracks and also remove some layers for materials, but nothing too drastic. We reduced the grass around the track for example, but we tried to keep the experience as similar as possible.”
“The Spike Engine was extended to support the Vita platform so it’s the same graphical engine but the actual assets had to be tweaked. So the code is exactly the same, it was just a case of adding a new platform to our engine”, Stefano adds.
Controlling the car felt satisfyingly fluid as I navigated the treacherous obstacle course that is Monte Carlo. While the physics again seemed very similar to the console iteration, the handling felt more forgiving overall, but this is most likely due to the Vita’s limited control inputs.
Steering with the Vita’s smaller analogue nub simply doesn’t offer the same precision as a
standard controller, as Head Designer Irvin Zonca confirms: “The changes that you feel are probably due to the different way that the processor processes the physics because the code is really the same. It’s like when you play across PS3, 360 and PC – the code and the tuning is the same but the input changes a bit between the platforms.”
“For example, the 360 controller is very different from the PS3 controller because of the placement of the sticks and the response time for the console. We were expecting to have problems to be honest – we thought that we would have to tweak down the physics and were quite worried. But everything turned out fine.”
Sadly, although perhaps predictably, compromises had to be made in order to prevent the Vita version from becoming a stuttering wreck. The most significant omission is WRC3’s Road to Glory, which of course means that WRC3 on Vita doesn’t have a main career mode. You can still play through Championships so there is still some sense of progression, but it’s a risky move considering that Gran Turismo on PSP received significant backlash for not including a career mode.
Irvin believes that this was necessary in order to adapt WRC3 for the portable market, however: “Contents are different to suit the portable platform so we focused on single races and WRC championship,” he explains.
“For our first WRC title on Vita we wanted to focus on technology to have a solid experience while you are racing the tracks. We also decided it would be better to create really good visuals and physics – since it is on a portable console people are more likely to play it on the underground or in the car etc, so they are looking for a quicker gaming experience. We think that giving a very good quick experience is better than adding too much content without a solid base for the engine, graphics and physics because it’s always a trade-off of ‘what should I implement first?’"
Unfortunately, Milestone’s ambition to keep the graphics and performance on a par with the console games has meant that WRC3 on Vita will have significantly less stages, too. Only six locations will be available from launch compared to 13 elsewhere, comprising Rallye Monte-Carlo, Rallye de France - Alsace, RallyRACC-Rally de Espana, Acropolis Rally, ADAC Rallye Deutschland and Wales Rally GB. Each stage remained faithful with the exception of the Germany stage, which looked as though it could do with some touching up on the build I played. Fortunately, Rally Guanajuato Mexico, Philips Rally Argentina and Vodafone Rally de Portugal will be added post release as free DLC to soften the blow.
The car count has also been decreased. Only 11 out of WRC3’s 37 cars are bundled with Vita version, but this comes as a result of Road to Glory being dropped. All of the official WRC, Class 2 and Class 3 cars are in, but you won’t be able to drive the retro Group B cars that featured in Road to Glory for example. As with the tracks, hopefully Milestone can release some of the missing cars as DLC at a later date.
As for multiplayer, WRC3 on Vita will only support 6 players as opposed to 16 and the photo mode also won’t be included.
Speaking with Setefano reveals that the Vita could have quite easily stored all of WRC3’s data in reality, but this would have prevented WRC3 from running at that all-important 30 FPS: “We didn’t have any big memory issues on Vita, it was much more to do with performance issues”, he confirms. It’s for these reasons that Crossplay sadly won’t be available for WRC3 due to the differing content across the platforms.
It’s a shame that WRC3 on Vita has been so severely stripped of content, especially when you consider that it will retail for almost the same price as full console versions and the fact that Criterion have managed to virtually cram in Need for Speed Most Wanted on the same platform in its entirety.
It’s understandable, however, when you consider that this was Milestone’s first dabble with the PS Vita, which gave them their own objectives. “The Vita version is not a direct port of the main console version. The main console versions gave us the chance to include more content, but this is the first year we have been developing for the Vita hardware”, says Irvin. “I think we have achieved a very good result with the graphics and handling – the handling remains the same as the PS3 and 360 version so all the simulation aspects are there.”
Considering that developing for the Vita was uncharted territory for Milestone, you would expect them to face a host of technical challenges. This apparently wasn’t the case according to Stefano: “I think it’s been easier than we expected to program for the Vita, “It was more or less like the other platforms”, he says. “The PS3 tends to be a bit trickier to work with because its architecture is quite different to other platforms and PC, but the Vita fits in-between the Xbox 360 and PS3 in terms of difficulty. At the beginning we had some issues but we were able to work with Sony to quickly resolve them.”
“Vita is a powerful platform, so it’s not so far from the PS3 and Xbox 360 even though it’s a portable console. Porting over WRC3 was therefore not so difficult. We also thought it was a good trial for our supporters to publish a game on Vita so they could experience the game outside of their homes.”
From what I played, Milestone have done a commendable job with porting WRC3 onto the Vita that trounces WRC's last outing on PSP by remaining faithful to the source material. For avid racing game fans who want a rally game on the move, Sony could potentially have a system seller on their hands - WRC3 is by far and away the most realistic driving game currently available for Vita, which puts it in a class of its own.
Join us next time where we'll be taking a behind the scenes look at WRC3's unique artwork as we come to the end of the road with our interview with Milestone.

Entertainment Industry Gets Another Usenet Provider To Shut Down: Is Usenet Illegal?
from the the-state-of-the-internet dept
I first got online in the days before the web existed, and spent much of my time on Usenet, that group of message boards that was useful for discussions of all types. While obviously much of those conversations moved to the web or email over the years, it's still pretty ridiculous to see the entertainment industry continue to attack Usenet and basically act as if all of Usenet is illegal. As we noted a little over a month ago, a court in the Netherlands sided with anti-piracy group BREIN, and ordered Usenet provider News-Service (NSE) to wave a magic wand and somehow figure out which Usenet posts were infringing and which weren't. Not surprisingly, that's impossible, and NSE has announced that it's just shutting down entirely instead. NSE was the largest Usenet provider in Europe. And now it's dead. Because the entertainment industry refuses to adapt, and thus blames the technology for how the technology is used, a useful (legal) service is gone. For what it's worth, NSE will continue to appeal the court's ruling... but only on principle. As an operating effort, it appears NSE is dead. Another one killed by the entertainment industry.

Pandora restricts free mobile listening to 40 hours per month, citing royalty woes
Streaming music service Pandora is reintroducing a cap on free mobile listening due to another hike in royalty rates this year. Desktop users will still benefit from unlimited ad-supported free listening, but mobile users will only get 40 hours of free music each month starting March 1.
To continue listening for more than 40 hours per month on mobile devices, Pandora users have to either plunk down $0.99 in an in-app purchase or subscribe to the premium Pandora One plan ($36 per year), which does not include ads. Pandora said in a blog post announcing the changes that the limit will affect under four percent of its monthly active listeners, as the average listener spends 20 hours per month using the service.
Pandora used to have a firm 40-hour listening cap for free listeners from 2009 up until 2011, when the company abandoned the limit. The company said it was forced to reintroduce a mobile cap due to significant increases in royalty rates in the past few years.
Pandora founder Tim Westergren explained: “Pandora's per-track royalty rates have increased more than 25 percent over the last 3 years, including 9 percent in 2013 alone and are scheduled to increase an additional 16 percent over the next two years. After a close look at our overall listening, a 40-hour-per-month mobile listening limit allows us to manage these escalating costs with minimal listener disruption.”
The music streaming service pays more than half of its revenue in royalties, so rates have always been an issue for Pandora, which argues that Web radio services are paying too much for streaming rights. Last year, Pandora CEO Joe Kennedy backed legislation intending to change how royalties are levied on music streaming companies compared to traditional radio—which doesn’t pay royalties at all. Naturally, the bill was met with opposition by groups representing artists and copyright owners. Congress never got around to examining the Internet Radio Fairness Act, leading to its apparent demise, but it could be reintroduced under a different name soon, Billboard reports.
Meanwhile, Pandora competitor Slacker Radio continues to offer free unlimited mobile listening, while Spotify and Rdio charge $9.99 per month subscription for streaming from mobile devices. Apple and Google are also rumored to be working on streaming music services of their own.

A big, HD TV is at the top of many people’s new year wish list and if you’re looking for a decent TV on a budget, then now is a great time to act. We’ll be reviewing TVs at £300 and under, so if you’re looking for a TV at this price then you may have to make some sacrifices – you won’t be able to get an ultra-thin, smart, 3D, 60 inch, LED, Full HD for that price, but you may be able to get one or two of those features. By making small compromises and concentrating on the things you do want (do you really need 3D?) you will be happy to know that there are many cheap televisions out there.
1# LG 42CS460 42-inch LCD TV
For the first TV we’re going for girth and 42 inches is about as large as you could hope for at just under £300. This full HD TV has built in freeview, which means you won’t have to shell out for a new box, as well as a couple of HDMI ports. It also has a USB port with DIVX playback which will come in very handy. This TV has decent sound and even better picture quality, so it’s a very good solution for your living room.
2# Samsung UE26EH4500 26-inch LED TV
If you are less concerned with sheer size and more concerned with having a fully featured TV that looks ultra-sleek, then this model from Samsung is a great one to go for. You can expect about £20 change from your £300 and for a Smart TV, that is very good value – you’ll be surfing the net from the comfort of your sofa in no time. The downside is the size, unless you’re using it for the bedroom or kitchen and it is HD ready rather than full HD, but a good option nonetheless
3# Finlux 32F702 32-inch 3D
Available at a bargain £240, this full HD 3D TV is a great option if you want 3D on a budget. A decent size with a good spec and good reviews, this is an excellent option for those on a budget. Some people are put off by the less well-known brand, but if you can see past this, you’ll have made a very good choice.
4# Samsung PS43E450 43-inch
If size is all that matters for you, then this Samsung will suit you well – it is the biggest we could find for under £300. While it isn’t full HD, many people prefer plasma for the colour and darkness levels, making it great value for money.
5# Samsung UE32EH5000 32-inch
Samsung feature a lot on the list for the simple fact they make some great TVs. This 32-inch is a thin and sleek LED TV that comes with built in freeview HD. After all, what’s the point in having an HD TV if you can’t watch any HD TV? This is an excellent TV with a great picture and an excellent choice for those on a budget.

Tiveragh Fairy Hill (Cushendall). Many believe that the wee folk live in this hill that is accessed by a nearby cave. As the warning goes, if ye are mortal, regardless of how appeasing the faerie music may sound, if you wander within, you’ll never be seen again on this plane of existence. Time holds a whole different rhythm in Faerieworlds.
We however, of fae persuasion, did venture up the hill at the turn of twilight just as the sun was going down. We spied the hill with visions of faerie impressions while across the valley atop Ossian’s Grave – the Megalithic tomb believed to be the burial spot of the fabled poet and bard Oisin. Now Oisin was lured into fae, into Tir na nOg where he lived until he requested to return to the land of mortals to visit his family. Of course due to faerie time, he came back several hundred years later to find them all gone and deceased. He fell off his faerie steed and became a blind old man wandering these fields eventually dying. If the faerie tale is true, this would be the hill he would have rode out of and across the valley would have been his grave overlooking it … curiouser and curiouser. Midway along the way up the base of the hill is one of the most magnificent Faerie Thorn Trees I’ve ever encountered. As usual with these faerie hills, I always find a wee hole just big enough for the Victorian sized fae to enter within, usually lined with heavy rocks, making it look peculiarly like its a miniature mine rather than a animal hole. We climbed atop as the sun was going down, empowered by the feelings of the ancient ones. Archaeologically though, this may be a massive hillfort. I’m looking for those records and will post my findings here.
I heard a commotion behind a wall,
I stopped and looked over, and boys-o-boys!
Now what do you think was making the noise?
Twas a Hurley match – and may I choke -–
It was two wee teams of the Fairy folk
That was rippling’ and tearing’ and weltin’ away
In the light of the moon was bright as day.
And their playing pitch was hardly as big
As my Uncle Barney’s potato rig;
And me there watchin’ them puck and clout –
At the back o’ the wall with my eyes stuck out.
When all at once, like the squeal of a hare,
A wee voice shouted, “Who’s that up there?””
And a bit off a thing about nine – inch tall
Came climbing up to the top of the wall.
And he stood there; he stood about pot -size
With his two wee fingers up at my eyes,
And its God’s own truth that I’m speakin’ mind ye,
“”Get out o’ that,” says he, “or I’ll blind ye!””
Aye that’s what he said, “I’ll blind ye,” says he,
And by Jing what he said was enough for me,
Did I run? Aye surely; I didn’t miss -–
And I haven’t seen Tiveragh from that to this.
~ H.Browne
And nobody goes there at night, no nobody at all.
The hill is small, the sides are steep.
And I have heard it said That flickering lights go in and out While everyone’s in bed.
And on the top two hawthorns grow, A white one and a red.
~ John Irvine Desmond
~ Yours truly, Leaf McGowan

App Battles Driver Distraction but Spares Passengers

Chen says the technology could be used by existing distraction-prevention apps to make them smarter. But the researchers are also working on a new suite of apps to leverage the driver sensing. One, in development at Rutgers’ Winlab, would notify people on your contact list that you are driving—and may even add prompts asking potential callers whether the call is a true emergency, says Janne Lindqvist, a Winlab researcher developing the app.
Another app in development integrates driver detection with calendars—making it easy to notify participants in an imminent meeting whether you’re running late. “If you are driving, this could become a one-button text message,” says Marco Gruteser, an associate professor at Rutgers. “It’s an interface question on the phone, so you don’t have to go through finding contact information and making the call.”
The Rutgers and Stevens group first demonstrated the driver-detection technology in the lab last year, but have since implemented it on phones and integrated it into apps. They are also working on simplifying the algorithm so that driver detection only takes half of the current seven to eight seconds.
The group plans to conduct studies this spring to determine whether the apps actually change people’s behavior, says Lindqvist. The technology will find its way into commercial offerings within a year, likely through licensing agreements, he predicted.
As well as calling for a ban on mobile device use, the NTSB also called for these sorts of technology solutions. “We have a problem here and it’s growing worse,” says Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of NTSB. “Technology has brought many of these challenges, but technology holds the key to the solution, too. Detecting the driver is a very critical piece.”
The key downside of the Rutgers and Stevens technology is that it relies on Bluetooth, which is absent in most older cars—and not universally available on new models, either. Even in cars with Bluetooth, it is good but not perfect; because of varying cabin sizes and speaker configurations, it accurately detects the driver in 90 percent of cars, and produces false positives in the single percentage range, Gruteser says.
It’s clear that technology solutions are badly needed, says Marcel Just, a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University. In a study published in 2008, Just used functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that merely listening to someone speak reduces brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent.
“It seems to me that disallowing cell phone use while driving through some technology fix is a good thing,” he says. “You can imagine it being legislated, and you can imagine insurance companies instituting an undistracted driver discount.” But to be effective, any technology fix would have to be widely implemented, and difficult for the driver to circumvent, he says.

aNewDomain.net — We live in an on-demand world, but if you plan on eating — without dropping some serious cash or gaining serious pounds — you need to plan.
From recipe selection to shopping to meal prep, the basic steps for cooking at home remain much as they did before smartphones and Google. I found an app, it’s called Ziplist, that’s worth a look.
Among all the shopping list apps out there, Ziplist stands out. It is a complete meal planning system, helping you find and save recipes, plan out a week’s worth of meals, and then get your shopping done.
A Recipe for Success
To get you started, Ziplist’s web app has tons of recipes to choose from. There is a robust Ziplist community of recipe sharers. But where Ziplist really shines is its capability for pulling recipes off the best of the Web. Not only does the site aggregate recipes from popular sites (such as epicurious.com), but it offers a nifty bookmarklet that will import recipes you find on any site.
Of course you can enter your own recipes, and you can tag all the meals you store in your Recipe Box. Best of all, you can add your own tags to them. This is immensely helpful when planning your busy day, and you want to choose from all the “crockpot” meals.
Once you’ve selected your meals from the list, your next step is to assign them easily to each day, creating a meal plan. If you are the OCD type, Ziplist offers the ability to import that meal plan as a feed into your calendar app.
Mise en place
With your meal plan in place, it’s time to migrate your ingredients list to your shopping list. Ziplist makes this easy: with a click of the Add to list button, Ziplist will make suggestions for your grocery run. Remove the items you already have, and you’re ready to go.
That shopping list is synced with your iPhone or Android app, which means you can jump right in the car and head to the store. Or better yet, since Ziplist has robust list sharing, call up your significant other and have him or her do the shopping on the way home (you just did all the hard work of meal planning, after all).
Too much salt
After trying and discarding nearly a dozen shopping apps, Ziplist is the one we use and love at my house. That’s not to say it can’t use some additional seasoning, however. Here are my complaints:
- Adding items via the phone app takes far too many steps, especially if you change the quantity.
- Adjusting the quantity via the phone app (by editing a quantity field) and the web app (by prefixing a number to the item name) is inconsistent and confusing.
- Marking items in the shopping list is dreadfully sensitive, and I often “check” items I haven’t actually picked up. A swipe gesture would be helpful.

RSS enables you to choose what news you're interested in and have it delivered directly to your Mac as it happens. No need to trawl through countless sites looking for interesting stuff; it will come to you.
To get started, find a source of news you want to read, add its RSS feed in your app of choice (a process known as subscribing), and hey presto, the news rolls in.
Nearly all news sites have RSS feeds (also called newsfeeds), as do the major blogging services and Twitter, so you can effectively manage your entire news intake through an RSS reader, given the right subscriptions.
Safari and Mail enable you to subscribe to RSS feeds, but their handling of them is very basic - we wouldn't recommend using either for RSS, since there are so many great bespoke apps that do a better job.
What we're looking for in these apps is ease of adding and managing lots of feeds and an elegant, easy-to-use layout that makes reading the news a pleasure. One other important factor to consider is Google Reader integration.
There are two types of app here: the first type displays newsfeeds in columns and lists (NetNewsWire, Reeder, Socialite and NewsRack), whereas Pulp and Mixtab are more visual. Which you choose will depend on the kind of experience you want: if you subscribe to loads of different feeds, go for list-based, because it's the best way to work through lots of information nice and quickly. If you're after a more visually appealing look, go for one of the others.
RSS readers on test
Mixtab - Free
NetNewsWire - £14.95
NewsRack - £4.99
Pulp - £5.99
Reeder - £5.99
Socialite - £5.99
Test one: Adding RSS feeds
How simple is it to add your favourite RSS feeds?
The four that sync to your Google Reader account - NetNewsWire, NewsRack, Socialite and Reeder - are a snip to set up. But only Reeder and NewsRack keep the feeds and folders in the same order they are on the Google account, and rearranging them is particularly irksome in Socialite, since it can hang as you move things.
Pulp will link to Google Reader, but only to pull in individual feeds - it won't bring in your whole list, nor will it keep read/unread items in sync. But to add feeds manually, you can often just type in the site's URL, rather than the specific feed one, and it'll soon find the feed.
NetNewsWire, Socialite and NewsRack also allow this; Reeder goes one better by enabling you to search by keyword and finding the feed for you. Irritatingly, Reeder and Socialite don't let you rename feeds. You have to add them manually to Mixtab, but the process is a bit long-winded and it struggles with some URLs that other apps handle fine.
Test results
Test two: Design and feel
It's all about the looks bettering the reading experience
Of the list-based apps, NetNewsWire, NewsRack and Socialite look and feel like old-school Mac software: buttons, folder icons and so on are similar to native Snow Leopard apps including Mail.
Reeder takes a refreshing, iOS-inspired approach. With bigger icons, buttons and toolbars, we love how it works so smoothly, new content and feeds fading in and out of view. It makes the other three feel rather antiquated.
Pulp is like a print newspaper with headlines on the front pages, which fold away like paper to read a story. We thoroughly enjoyed adding selected feeds to it and spending time reading over breakfast; it feels less like you're reading on a computer. But the interface isn't great for adding lots of feeds you want to skim through quickly.
Mixtab displays each feed on a tile with a customisable logo or an image from the top article. But because of the odd behaviour of the images, making it look good can present a challenge.

One of the most exciting new features in HTML5 is the <video> tag, because it addresses a very common use case that currently is a headache (and potentially expensive) to deal with unless you are willing to put your content up on a site like YouTube. In addition to being free to use, the video tag is increasingly supported in browsers. For better or for worse, no video codec is specified by the HTML5 specification, which is the major drawback to using it, but it looks as though MPEG will be fairly well supported.
The first question you may have is, “What do I do about browsers that do now support <video>?” That is easily answered: the <video> tag may contain additional content, but browsers supporting <video> should not display it. This means that you can use the contents of <video> to have a reasonable default (a “can’t display content” message, a Flash video player, an embedded YouTube object, etc.) that won’t be displayed if the browser supports it.
Using <video> is not difficult at all, and in fact is a lot like using <img>. The basic attributes you should know about are src, width, and height, which all work as they do with <img>. You can use the poster attribute to specify the URL of an image to be used to display while the video content is loading. If you want the video to start playing when ready, add the autoplay attribute (you can either just use “autoplay” by itself, or “autoplay=autoplay”). To not use autoplay, either omit it entirely, or set it to false with “autoplay=”"”. You can use the same syntax with the “loop” attribute (to have the video automatically start over again when done) or the “muted” attribute (to have the sound shut off). Another useful attribute is “controls”; if this is true (again, just “controls” or “controls=controls” will set it to true, and leaving it out or “controls=”"” will set it to false) then the browser will be responsible for displaying various controls; otherwise, you will need to make an interface in HTML and use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM to control the video playback.
The “preload” attribute is used to tell the browser if it should start to load the video before it starts to play. A value of “none” means that the browser should not preload at all, “metadata” tells it to load only the video’s metadata, and “auto” allows the browser to get as much of the video as it wants ahead of time. If you set the value to “” then it will act as if you specified “auto.” The HTML5 spec suggests (but does not require) that browsers use “metadata” if the value is not specified. You will want to definitely use a value here to ensure that the behavior is what you expect.
An interesting piece of the puzzle is the “mediagroup” attribute. By specifying a value for “mediagroup” you can have multiple <video> or <audio> elements tied to the same set of browser controls; when one plays, they all play, when one stops, they all stop. This is especially useful for providing alternative videos for accessibility. For example, you could have a secondary video that plays a series of text describing the main video for deaf users, and another with an audio track narrating the main video for blind users. An alternative to usability for the hearing disabled is the <track> element. You can use it to provide the browser with information on time track text files, which will provide captions, subtitles, etc. to be overlaid by the browser onto the video automatically.
As you can see, the <video> element makes it very easy to get your video content onto the Web, so long as your server can handle the load (use the “preload” attribute wisely). The big question mark in all of this is the codec situation, and it may require you to perform some user agent sniffing and manipulation of the src attribute (either on the server side or the client side via JavaScript) to determine which file to be used, based on the current codec support from each browser.

Brad, nice post but i think monitoring is obvious and common sense, when you write about automated tools, you can spend all the time in the world monitoring your systems, but if you are not able to quickly identify, analyze and resolve the problems, youre really no better off than you were at the start of the process. Simply put, monitoring just isn't enough to keep IT operations running efficiently (i believe this is the big challenge). Think about what happens in the event of a system outage. Whether its. This is where automated tools get's in!
I would suggest taking sometime and writing about the benefits of automation tools and also to list some of them, i can also think of at least 100 ways sysadmins can use automation tools, i can work with you on listing those...

Fiscal Multipliers And Policy Coordination
Source: Central Bank of Chile
This paper analyzes the effectiveness of fiscal policy at zero nominal interest rates. The author solves a stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky prices assuming that the government cannot commit to future policy. Real government spending increases demand by boosting public consumption. Deficit spending increases demand by generating inflation expectations. The author computes multipliers of government spending that calculate by how much each dollar of spending increases output. Both the deficit and the real spending multipliers can be large, but the multiplier of deficit spending depends critically on monetary and fiscal cooperation: it can be large with cooperation and zero without it.

Source: Borland
When one leave quality to the end, or as someone else's responsibility, it can result in applications that fail to meet the original goals, require costly rework or miss critical release dates. To prevent these problems, one need an advanced approach to managing overall quality throughout the software development lifecycle. The presenters will discuss Lifecycle Quality Management and the importance of infusing quality throughout the application development process helping to achieve better requirements management practices for software that meets business needs.

Towards Maximizing Wireless Testbed Utilization Using Spectrum Slicing
Source: Rutgers University
As experimentation becomes one of the de-facto approaches for benchmarking, researchers are turning to testbeds to test, review and verify their work. As a result, several research laboratories build wireless testbeds, in order to offer their researchers a real environment to test their algorithms. As testbeds become more and more popular, the need for a managerial tool that will not only provide a unified way for defining and executing an experiment and collecting experimental results, but that will also serve as many users as possible maximizing the utilization of its resources, is growing. In this paper, the authors propose a scheme that exploits wireless testbeds functionality by introducing spectrum slicing of the testbed resources.

I was wondering if there was some way I could throttle or divide up my 56k bandwidth between various program I run using the internet. Currently I find that if I have MSN Messenger open at the same time as I am downloading using AudioGalaxy (and yes I know it has spyware in it ) that Messenger will frequently sign out as it is not getting enough bandwidth. Audiogalaxy seems to have it's own bandwidth throttle (which helps a little), but I'd much rather another program to divide up my bandwidth between all the programs I use over the internet. That way I could maximise programs and games which need lot's of bandwidth and reduce the amount given to other programs. The most important one however, is to increase bandwidth to Messenger, so that it can stay signed in for more than 2 minutes at a time. Thanks for your help

The move is part of a larger effort at DHS to ensure that IT projects are delivered quickly, on time, and on budget. "Our reputation for delivering on time and on budget--let's just say we haven't historically gotten an A grade for that," DHS CIO Richard Spires said at the event.
DHS doesn't stand alone in its shift to agile. There are a number of agile efforts underway in government, including at the FBI and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Federal CIO Steven VanRoekel has also trumpeted agile development's virtues.
The move to agile development won't happen overnight at DHS, according to officials, as legacy processes are still entrenched. "There's still a lot of work to be done because this is different than the way things have been done in the past," said Transportation Security Agency CIO Emma Garrison-Alexander.
[ The Feds are developing a national mobile strategy as part of its efforts to improve IT efficiency. Read more at Federal Agencies Prepare For National Mobile Strategy. ]
However, it's clear that DHS CIOs believe that agile is definitely the development modality of the future for many scenarios. "Historically, we have had a contract that has some huge chunk of functionality included, and then five years later we don't understand why we're not there yet," said Charlie Armstrong, CIO of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. "We really think this is going to be our future, to help our programs be more successful."
DHS is looking to tailor its enterprise software development policy specifically for agile development to account for how significantly agile development differs from traditional development. For example, DHS deputy CIO Margie Graves said, the agency will need to build testing into the short, few-week "sprint" development cycles for which agile development is known. These sprint cycles are designed to deliver functionality quickly, so testing must be a part of each sprint, according to Graves.
DHS is also looking at rethinking how it contracts for IT services to support more agile development, according to Spires. That thought process is playing out at an agency level as well as a component organization level.
For example, U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services (CIS) will soon be awarding contracts on CRM and customer service initiatives and is working through how to integrate agile development into those contracts. One thought, according to CIS CIO Keith Jones, might be to award separate awards for different sprint cycles.
Agile development isn't the only thing DHS is doing to ensure that more of its projects come in on time and budget. For example, numerous CIOs at the event Tuesday also pointed to improved IT governance at DHS and touted their increasing use of cloud computing and service-oriented architectures as a way to help accomplish this task..

Now that nearly everyone on earth has a cell phone, they have become ingrained in our everyday lives. We carry them with us all the time, use them all the time, and run into people using their cell phones all the time. While there are no hard and fast rules for using cell phones in public, we sure know what we don't like, according to Nokia.
The cell phone maker conducted a poll several weeks ago to discover what behaviors we abhor the most. While family and friends are generally forgiving of our faults, colleagues and business partners may be less so. Keep the following in mind next time you're tempted to pull your smartphone out of your pocket during a lunch meeting with a client.
What ticks us off the absolute most? People who play games, movies, or music in public without using headphones. Instead, they blast their activities through the phone's speaker at full volume so every one within a half mile can hear it. This was picked as the most offensive behavior by 21.48% of respondents. I've seen it a million times on the subway in New York. Somebody has the volume cranked while playing Angry Birds and you can hear it throughout the entire car. What that person ends up with is a subway car full of Angry Commuters.
The second-most annoying habit also is volume related: Loud talkers get the thumbs down from 20.89% of respondents. This is something I encounter almost daily. Some random stranger is walking down the street, through the mall, into Starbucks while carrying on a conversation at full volume. Sorry, I don't need to hear it. Shut up! (Especially if you're talking about sensitive secret corporate stuff!)
Coming in third place, 17.49% of respondents said people who use their cell phones to send text messages--or, worse, make phones calls--in movie theaters deserve severe retribution. Movie theaters are dark. Phone screens are bright. When a cell phone lights up in a movie theater, it is really distracting. Given the cost of movie tickets these days, I'd be mad too if the person in front of me was checking their phone throughout the entire movie. As far as corporate life goes, the equivalent would be sending BBMs during a PowerPoint or other presentation in a darkened room. Turning on your cell phone when you're supposed to be paying attention to work-related stuff isn't going to win you any friends at work.
Personally, I think this one is pretty bad. Say you're standing at the water cooler or in the lunchroom talking to some colleagues. Right while you're in the middle of a story about what your crazy friend named Fred did over the weekend, one of your coworkers pulls out his/her phone and starts sending text messages. Just under 12% of people say that is really, really rude, and they wish you'd listen to them talk.
The fifth place winner surprised me a bit: 6.51% say the bad behavior that annoys them the most is when people take pictures and upload them without permission. One has to wonder what this 6.51% of people got themselves caught doing on camera that they don't want their social circles to know about.
Anyone who's attended a business meal will agree that it is rude when your dining companion breaks out his or her phone at the table during the meal. This bugs the heck out of 5.54% of people enough to make them enraged. Eating is a social activity, but not the time for posting updates to your social networks--especially if you're trying to close a sale.
If you are constantly looking at your phone's screen to see if you missed a call or a text message, chances are you're really annoying 4.66% of the people around you.
Are you always scrolling through your messages? That bugs 2.04% of people a lot.
Other bugaboos include using phones in restaurants, using your phone in bed, and over-doing it with the Foursquare check-ins.
Last, but not least, if you use your cell phone to cheat on a quiz down at your local pub, you're really ticking off 1.55% of.

Red Hat To Buy Cloud Management Expert ManageIQ
The Linux titan is on a shopping spree
Open source specialists Red Hat have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the US cloud and virtualisation management company ManageIQ, for approximately $104 million (£64m) in cash.
The deal will enable Red Had to offer new cloud management tools as part of its open source product portfolio.
Red Hat’s shopping cart
Headquartered in Mahwah, New Jersey, ManageIQ provides scalable enterprise-grade cloud management solutions, with unified monitoring and automation capabilities. These solutions, built on the company’s Adaptive Management Platform, are designed specifically to be used with virtualised infrastructure.
As an existing member of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation Certified Partner programme, ManageIQ has worked closely with its new owner. Its Hybrid Cloud Operations Management technologies complement Red Hat’s existing cloud and virtualisation tools – Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation.
In the near future, Red Hat will start offering ManageIQ’s Hybrid Cloud Operations Management Tools, to provide mechanisms for monitoring, chargeback, governance and orchestration across virtual and cloud infrastructure, to be used with services from Amazon, Microsoft and VMware.
“Industry and customer response to Red Hat’s vision for the open hybrid cloud has been overwhelmingly positive because it offers the best of both worlds: the ability to tap into the public cloud when and where it makes sense, while leveraging existing investments for cloud infrastructure,” explained.”
The acquisition is expected to have no material impact to Red Hat’s revenue for its fiscal year ending in February 2013. The company has just published its financial results for the quarter ending in November, that show an 18 percent increase in revenue year-on-year.
,” said Jim Whitehurst, president and chief executive officer of Red Hat.

LibreOffice 4.0 speaks content management
With the release of LibreOffice 4.0, the Document Foundation continues to makes strides in preparing the open source office suite for enterprise use, adding the ability to work with many ECM (enterprise content management) systems and updated compatibility with many Microsoft file formats.
"LibreOffice continues to be the chief free alternative to Microsoft Office, and the improvements [in version 4.0] make it more attractive," said Forrester analyst Phil Karcher.
LibreOffice 4.0 provides a way for organizations to link LibreOffice with their content management systems, including Microsoft SharePoint, Alfresco, IBM FileNet P8, Nuxeo, OpenText, SAP NetWeaver Cloud Service and others. The software uses the CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Services) standard to communicate with these systems.
With CMIS, you can check documents in and out of ECM systems directly from LibreOffice. "Previously you could do this, but you had to use a horrible Web interface," said Michael Meeks, who is a Free Software Engineer for SUSE, and one of the key managers of LibreOffice development.
LibreOffice 4.0 comes with a number of other enterprise-friendly features as well. The suite can now also import documents from the latest versions of Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Publisher. It can also better render text documents written in the Microsoft .DOCX and the RTF (Rich Text Format) formats.
LibreOffice also provides some help for executives making presentations with LibreOffice's Impress. Someone running a slide presentation in a group meeting can use an Android smartphone as a remote control. Impress can now show both the notes and the presentation on the presenter's phone while displaying the actual presentation page on the display for the audience, and keep the two in synch. The remote only works with Linux computers, though a version is being ported to Windows as well, Meeks said.
The Calc spreadsheet is being refined to match the capabilities of Microsoft's Excel. Charts can now be exported as images. New functions have been added, and performance overall has been improved. "The spreadsheet is still not at [Microsoft] Excel's level, but we're trying to improve scalability, storage size and performance in lots of ways, and making good performance there," Meeks said.
The newly released LibreOffice 4.0 comes with an expanded set of APIs (application programming interfaces) that will allow developers and organizations to build better plug-ins for the software. The user interface has been refined as well.
Since its fork from OpenOffice 30 months ago, LibreOffice seems to have no shortage of volunteers to help contribute to the code. The project has thus far attracted more than 500 developers, who have submitted over 50,000 changes and updates.
The LibreOffice developers have added or replaced several million lines of code, in many cases taking advantage of new speedy C++ constructs. Deprecated methods and obsolete libraries have been removed, and many of the comments in the source code have been translated from German to English (the code base for LibreOffice originally came from a German company, StarDivision, and was known as StarOffice).
Leading the development of LibreOffice, the Document Foundation has been keeping enterprise use in mind, Meeks said. And some organizations are using the office suite as an alternative to Microsoft Office. The city of Munich, for instance, is deploying LibreOffice. Vendors are taking note of the software as well: Novel bundles LibreOffice with its GroupWare collaboration software for a combined package.
Although LibreOffice 4.0 can be thought of as an iterative release, it makes up for a lot of lost momentum that occurred when LibreOffice split from OpenOffice two years back, Karcher said. The performance improvements and updated compatibility with Microsoft file formats help in this regard, though improvements still need to be made in collaboration and mobile use, he said.
LibreOffice 4.0 can be downloaded at no cost.

èThe setup which appears by pressing del/f2 at the time of pc start, what should we call it bios setup or CMOS setup. This setup is software.
èCMOS battery (lithium battery) provide power to update date and time when main supply off. It shows that CMOS is software. When we backup and restore bios this is also software.

When we purchase any HDD, memory card or USB flash drive etc. It shows less space than its printed capacity. What is the actual reason behind this? Ex.:- a 500 GB capacity HDD only shows 465.75 GB. Where are other 34.75 GB? If we check flash drive shows less space than printed capacity. Same thing happened with other storage media. I want to know its actual reason. Please reply if you know.

Provisions: Part 3 Substance
by
Mark Newell
One of the few things a wildlife manager can have some control of is FOOD. With food plots, habitat manipulations, and other techniques managers can supply their critters with the adequate food requirements they need. However, it is still up to the wildlife, both young and old, to consume what is provided for them. In this devotion you will see how turkeys provide food for their young and compare that with the way God provides us with food spiritually.
The Provision of Substance
I. The Mamma Hen’s Provision
* Serving up Insects and other Invertebrates
With most animals it is up to the mother to provide their young with high quality nutritious food. The whitetail fawn gets its nourishment from its mother’s milk, but the wild turkey poult gets its nourishment from mostly insects. Also, unlike other bird species the young poult must catch its own meal. So, to successfully raise her young, the mamma hen takes them to places where they can feed on these highly nutritious delicacies. They are called bugging areas.
A. The County Side
I have seen hens and their poults many times out in fields covered up with different species of short flowering plants. Any short stemmed flower is perfect for the little guys because with one bite of a small flower yields the poult a mouth full of tiny insects. As a manager I like to plant clovers in all of my food plots. Once the clover plant flowers it attracts many small insects and it is short enough for poults to feed on them.
B. The River Bottom
The hen will also take her young to the edge of creeks, streams, and other low-lying areas where water in present. All sorts of bugs and other invertebrates can be found in these areas. Around 90% of a healthy poult’s food intake is of insects and other inverts. The foliage also around these areas is highly digestible and very nutritious.
II. The Master’s Healthy Provision
* Serving up the Infallible Word of God.
For the young and old Christian it is essential that they feed on God’s Word. If any wildlife species does not get the proper nutrition that it needs it will not grow properly and even may die (especially with the young.) The same is true for the Christian. However, like the little poult you must do it yourselves. Mamma may take you to the church house and even give you a Bible, but you must feed from it yourself. You need to feed from God’s Word daily in order to grow in the faith and grow closer to Him. In order to have a healthy Christian life God’s Word must be a constant. About 90% of a Christian’s growth comes from the intake of the Infallible Word of God. I will delight myself in thy statues: I will not forget thy word. Psalm 119:16. O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. Psalm 119:97.
A. The Church House
During the average Sunday service at my church there are four different lessons from the Bible that is taught. They are one Sunday school lesson, two sermons, and one discipleship training/Bible study lesson. That is a lot of God’s Word feed to those who go to church. A Bible buffet of spiritual nutrition that all of us need to be actively a part.
B. Read your Bible
Attending church and other church activities are important, however, it is only a supplement to daily Bible readings and daily Bible devotions. Somewhat like food plots and supplemental feeding is to a sound management plan on any given property. A believer’s Bible should be their most prized possession because the Lord took it upon Himself to inspire and speak these Words to those who love Him. There is a little saying out there that goes something like this: A person who goes to church just for the preaching hour loves himself; a person who goes to all of the church services loves his pastor and church; however, a person who goes to all of his church’s services and reads his Bible daily, loves his Lord. The Bible is a blessed book. Read It! You will find out that God’s Infallible Word is all the Substance needed. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Matt. 4:4.
God Bless and Happy Hunting.

How can we create a new relationship with death?
Our culture has a predominantly negative attitude towards death. We talk about "saving" lives (as if lives can be saved, rather than merely extended briefly). We talk about unnecessary loss of life. We talk about surviving illnesses as the only positive outcome and how we can avoid aging. And yet our planet can barely tolerate the population it has. We don't have enough food, fuel, or collective common decency to make eternal life a viable outcome. We need to change the conversation to one in which death is respected and appreciated -- but how do we do that without being DISrespectful to the living?
Closing Statement from Kaila Colbin
Hi everyone,
Firstly, thank you so much for your comments and concern following the recent earthquake in Christchurch. We have been very lucky; my family and loved ones are all safe, though we mourn for the more than 200 lives lost.
And thank you also for your willingness to explore this difficult topic, for which I certainly don't have the answers. At TED this week, we heard from many people doing fantastic things in medicine: exoskeletons that allow paralyzed people to walk, 3D printers that can print a kidney in 7 hours, even intentional gene manipulation for controlled evolution. My hope in starting this debate was to question the fundamental assumption underlying these marvelous inventions: namely, that death should always be avoided where possible and that any extension of life is always a good thing.
Many of us have found beauty in death. When my father passed away four years ago, I was heartbroken; I still grieve for him. But he was 83, he had had a stroke 6 years earlier, and it was time for him to go. There was nothing unfair in it. Death is not always a tragedy.
The theme of the upcoming TEDGlobal is The Stuff of Life, and apparently that will include discussions on our relationship to death. I hope we can continue to explore this topic: the one topic that is common to us all.
Warmest regards,
Kaila
Mohannad Dolati
some may believe death is a transit way to other life, while some may not . personally and as my religion (Islam) taught me and as logic and life process suggests, I believe that we are not created randomly and for nothing. there must be punishments and awards, which are in the other life of course, cuz we see that it's impossible to apply the perfect fair judgement here in this life, and many people live without offering the world anything good, but at the contrary, they only cause of crimes and wars. and those people may die with no punishment. So there MUST be sometime they get punished in for what they have done; in which what is called "the judgment day".
therefore, if someone does good deeds, offers good opportunities for a better life, helps other human kinds. I don't think this person may fear of death cuz he knows he will be awarded for what he has done.
however, and as I said, some people may not believe in other life or judgment day . so I think there must be some fear here, at least from the unknown waiting for them after death.
thanks for bringing this topic up.

I think comfort is a big part of creating a good relationship with anyone or anything, I am a spirit being having a human experience, and as such, I am comfortable on this earth school, and also comfortable knowing I will be going back home. Actually though, I was more comfortable in the spirit state of being, rather than in human form. I had a chance to leave the earth school after a near fatal head injury 21 years ago. I didn't want to come back here, but I did, and I am content:>)

Generally, it is the nature of things (human as well as other species) to want to survive. Certain instincts are core that bias us to survival and to keeping those around us alive. It is hard not to talk about unnecessary loss of life when a young life that has not reached its full potential to contribute is taken suddenly. This likely comes from a healthy respect and appreciation for the finality of death.
While I do not believe we are always capable and skilled in determining when progress toward the end has surpassed the benefits associated with trying to prevent it. I don't think that giving up on efforts to improve our skills here and adjusting our perspective on death to accomodate the resource concerns is the right choice as a means to address those problems. I would turn to solutions for those problems separately and with the assumption that the pursuit of extended quality life years is desired.

another and that's more importnat : having the assurence that we'll be very very good after death.
another: waiting to die .
Colleen Steen 500+
I agree that living with the fear of death every day is comparable to living with any kind of danger every day. As individuals, what is our relationship to living with death or any kind of danger every day? How does that impact our lives? I believe that living with any fear (anxiety, frustration, anger,etc.) on a daily bases could actually shorten our lives because of the stress on the body, heart and mind. It's understandable why people in a war zone, for example, have fear of death. For those of us living in relatively "normal" circumstances, and afraid of death, it seems that it is a good idea to talk about our fears, and maybe come to terms with death so the fear does not adversly impact our life and heath.
I also agree with you that being clear about our beliefs, and what happens to us after death is good to explore.

I believe it is beneficial to begin understanding death when we are healthy, rather than waiting until we are diagnosed with a terminal illness. My insight is that any and all information is valuable whenever we are ready to explore. I am healthy now, and I had a near death experience after a brain injury 21 years ago, and at the same time diagnosed with cancer. I am still exploring death, whether or not I am healthy at the moment.

Now concerning your question, I don't see any reason to change anything in our relationship to death, if at all, we should increase our efforts in prevention of aging and rejuvenation.
In my opinion death has only gained a special spiritual status due to the fact that over milennia we were not capable of fully understanding why we eventually die. But now we can see it for what it is - the outcome of decades of constant cell and tissue degradation caused by our body functioning. Just like any machine suffers wear and tear over time and needs new spare parts so do we constantly need new cells, unfortunately small mistakes occur and grow over time to a critical size... but that's about it. I don't see a plan of some great "watchmaker" intended to only give us limited time, I see the outcome of life having evolved.
And as we constantly try to improve ourselves - Mr. Juan Enriquez talk on homo evolutis is very good on this subject - why should we not attempt to stop death with research like that of Mr. Aubrey deGrey? What is there to lose by not dying?
Well, you don't get to find out if anything comes after death, but considering the prospect of non-existence I don't think I want to know that answer.
And regarding our limited resources I wouldn't be too afraid. By the time we'll be able to "cheat" death we will have probably already started colonizing the Solar System and perhaps already venture beyond it. We have billions of places to go and explore, space is not the problem, time is.
To conclude my point, I feel that death is something we can outgrow as a species as we eventually reach a new level of development. Unless we manage to blow ourselves up our descendants will one day be barely able to understand what limited life means.
To end on another note, true eternity may not even be achievable. I particularly like Asimov's "The Last Question", by far my favourite short story. Can we reverse entropy?
Marcin Kasiak 200+
Our humanity, I guess? The averseness of mortality and limited time makes us who we are. Our culture and life choices grow upon that realization. I'm not saying that the immortality is something bad - I don't know. But that would make us something completely different then who we are now.
Colleen Steen 500+
Sabin, you say, "I don't see any reason to change anything in our relationship to death, if at all, we should increase our efforts in prevention of aging and rejuvenation". Aren't they related? Do you think that our efforts to prevent aging, may at times, be an effort to avoid death?
Sabin Muntean 30+
Colleen, indeed, I see preventing aging as a first step, you basicall try to make the clock go a little slower. Then once you manage that, you can try to make it go backwards. I believe Aubrey deGrey also mentions this point at the beginning of his talk.
Colleen Steen 500+
You may be right with your statement above, that "death is something we can outgrow as a species as we eventually reach a new level of development", and perhaps part of that process is turning back the clock. Maybe that is happening now, evidenced by the fact that we are living longer healthier lives. The reality at the moment, however, is that death is still part of our lives. I meet a lot of people who are genuinely afraid of death, and it seems to adversly impact their everyday life. I think it is beneficial to deal with any fears we experience. I personally am not afraid of death, in fact, I'm looking forward to going home again. It appears that you are not afraid of death, and that's a good thing:>)
Marcin Kasiak 200+
But, said that, I do agree that the death is an inseparable part of life. Unfortunately in the last years it became a taboo. We don't want to accept that at some point we all have to die. That leads to imho sad consequence that people die in the hospitals surrounded by doctors and machines, not at their homes surrounded by the loving families. We tend to think that if someone dies it is because of negligence, that someone should have done something to prevent it. Especially with modern technologies it is easy to refuse the fact of our mortality and fight for ones lives even when there is no hope and when it causes more harm then good.
Colleen Steen 500+
I think you bring up an important part of why we, in western culture particularly, are sometimes afraid of death. Have modern technologies seperated us from the dying process? As you mention, people die in hospitals surrounded by doctors and machines rather than at their homes surrounded by the loving families.
In some cultures, it is normal for those who are passing to be with their families, and that was true for western culture in the "old days". Since the advent of modern technologies, the belief is that it is sometimes not practical to have people dying at home. The more technologies and the importance of "saving" people no matter what, the further and further we got from the family participating in the process, and the more we become afraid of the dying process because we're no longer familier or comfortable with it.
With the hospice care I've participated in, it's interesting to observe the dynamics of the patient and family, as I'm sure you see, Marcin as a Doctor. There are many factors which drive the dynamics, but I think the seperation from death that we have experienced because of modern technology has definetely intensified our fear of the process.
loop johnny 30+
I don't think you can achieve that without invalidating basic human rights. Death is the end of ones live. Are you saying that those who are not useful to the planet should not get their life 'extended'?
Colleen Steen 500+
How about starting with a basic idea? How do you feel about death?

You offer a very tantalizing topic for me, but maybe not for everyone! There seems to be a fear of death in some cultures, while other cultures accept death as part of the life/death cycle. I think there are many factors behind each person's belief, like religious teachings, cultural practices, etc. The first step to understanding anything is to be able to speak about it openly and honestly, and you have provided the forum to do that.
I had a near death experience years ago when I sustained a head injury, and for me, death was not frightening. I've also provided care for people as they were passing over, and it can be a beautiful experience if one is not afraid of the process. How about providing the link to Jill Bolte Taylor's talk - Stroke of insight, as a reference for people who want to pursue this topic further?

After the controversy surrounding the exposure of the Trump boys' safari photos of African game, CEO of Camping World, Marcus Lemonis, was contacted and educated by your fearless SpiritWild leader, Uncle Ted, and he upgraded his awareness to the reality of the pureness of hunting as the ultimate and only honest conservation tool to keep wildlife flourishing.
Marcus is a good man and totally supports hunting and fishing as the wonderful lifestyle that it is. We support Camping World and recommend it to all our fellow sporters.
Spread it far and wide - polite activism/education/upgrade works!
Godspeed all!
-Nuge
As CEO of Camping World, I support all Americans who celebrate the time honored family traditions of hunting and fishing, and all choices of quality, legal, environmentally positive outdoor recreation. I know that millions and millions of family’s camp, hike, canoe, kayak, off-road, explore and enjoy all these wonderful activities and I feel a kinship with them. Nature heals, freedom is the end all and we here at Camping World are proud to be a part of that soul cleansing lifestyle.

It is not surprising that these unknown mixtures can cause dangerous side effects, such as seizures, memory loss, coma and even death.
This comment gives the unfortunate impression that it is only the "unknown mixtures" that cause dangerous side effects. In point of fact many of these drugs are entirely capable of leading to dangerous outcomes all by themselves. MDMA, or Ecstasy, itself, uncontaminated by anything else, is perfectly capable of resulting in seizure, hyperthermia and hyponatremia. In fact, the reported cases of medical emergency that involve other substances being ingested frequently have a symptom cluster that is identical to where MDMA is the only drug which was consumed. This suggests quite strongly that those other drugs may not even be strong contributors to the medical emergency.
i think this story is great and helps you learn more about drugs
why anybody would put their bodies and life at risk doesnt make sense to me.
If it deadly to make them at home, who would want to make it. it gross and not fun.
drugs are drugs and you should not use them unless prescribe by a doctor. designer durgs the name does not matter they are still drugs and you should not use them
I can't believe that these unknown compunds can lead to death. NOT SUPRISED!!! Thats why I don't do drugs. I don't want to be addicted.
teens are asking about this and i'm glad their questions are being anwsered. Because if they don't want to take bad drugs they know which ones to stay away from you.
Teens are trying these drugs and are ruining their lives for the future and the present.
I dont like the term "designer drugs" makes them seem more "cool".
[commercial link removed, per guidelines]
Thanks for sharing such idea. I hope, it will help teenagers.
[commercial link removed, per guidelines]
pretty interesting and cool
Really why do durgs they make your horrible
Alright most of what you guys are saying is not true. Just because you do these party drugs dosent mean your going to to get addicted and ruin your life, if your already going to be a loser in life working a [expletive deleted, per guidelines] job and committing crimes i don't think drugs made you like that unless your on meth but I think anything in moderation is ok I [deleted per guidelines] have never been addicted or come close to dying. I'm almost don't with college and have maintained a 3.5 gpa. Once I'm done I'm gonna be making 50,000 a year staring out do you consider that ruining my future? I'm not saying anyone should do these drugs but what you guys are saying is completely biased, but if you are research it and know what your doing.
@Collegestudent First, you are absolutely correct – taking drugs does not make you a loser. If a person chooses to take drugs and does become addicted, that does not make them a loser either. People respond differently to different drugs, and sometimes a person can get caught up in the drug and become addicted when they certainly didn’t intend to. Even the same drug in the same person can cause different reactions at different times in that person’s life. And in some cases, a substance may not even contain any of what you thought you were taking! So, it’s generally a risky business….Good luck with college and your new job.
Drugs are bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
pot = not oooohhh
be cool!!! stay in school!
if you do drugs then im not you r friend
@ everyone that thinks they know...you don't. These new designer drugs, like the salts, destroy lives, and it seems to be an equal opportunity destroyer from what I have watched in my own hometown. Destroying marriages, parents, careers, honor roll students; both high school and college...I watched two of my dearest friends and my boyfriend get caught up in the bath salt craze..I lost all 3 of them to the drug. We had all been in recovery for 8+ years, and in 1 month you wouldn't know unless you knew them prior. It's heartbreaking to watch someone you love attempt to end their life repeatedly..to lie, steal, and hurt those they loved. The people I loved are gone to me forever because I didn't listen when someone talked about how bad these drugs were..I'm not saying I could have stopped them, but I will always wonder.
Anyone that says drugs are bad is ignorant. Drugs, inherently, are neither good nor bad. Nothing in the world is good or bad. People put labels on everything in order to simplify the world but create half truths and ignorance in the process
DRUGS ARE BAD....THANKS FOR THE INFO
I loved this
extacy wont hurn ya :)
Ecstasy, or MDMA, actually can hurt you – it can cause confusion, depression, sleep problems, drug craving, and severe anxiety. In high doses, MDMA can interfere with your body’s ability to regulate temperature, sometimes leading to hyperthermia, which can result in organ failure or death. Ecstasy tablets may also contain some ‘mysterious’ substances – so you never know what you may be taking or what the effects may be.
just a little though
"drugs are drugs and you should not use them unless prescribe by a doctor. designer durgs the name does not matter they are still drugs and you should not use them"
oh yes, if they're from a doctor and FDA approved, they MUST be safe because you know whats in them.
in my opinion, ignorance is the worst drug
@Wilson No drug is 100% safe – prescription or otherwise. People react differently to different drugs. That is why it is very important for your doctor to monitor your medications to ensure you are receiving the proper dosage and to watch for side effects.
Its very informative article.i don't like"designer drugs".thans
College student, to start off with for someone so educated your grammar is terrible. Secondly i think your counting your chickens before they hatch. Your not finished with school yet. [deleted, per guidelines]. I have many more years of lifes experiences than you and from what i can tell you are an [deleted, per guidelines] fool. Children and teenagers that still have a choice and a future, Saying drugs will ruin your life is an understatement. I have seen smart people with good futures die from drugs. People that could have been doctors, chemist, astronauts ended up throwing their life away while they were looking for a way to get high. So if you want to listen to college student, (someone who probably has not finished their first semester) then go ahead a throw your life away. And when you are sitting in jail because you got busted by the cops, i hope you remember reading this because you wont even be able to get a job at mcdonald's.
These drugs aren't particularly dangerous by themselves, and in general taking drugs is no more dangerous than many activities we readily engage in on a daily or weekly basis. The greatest threat of all posed by designer drugs is that buyer may not get exactly what they signed up for, and consuming something unknowingly is inherently dangerous. If someone is really intent on taking something, whether or not they should, I think it's in everyone's best interest that that something is somehow regulated.
What They Look like aspen or tunes is the big drugs you buy no the street can kill you too no drug is100/safe even if is so
Many teens come the police do not know about some of Theses drugs and how power they Are . Hope the if there is a thatEmt Can

You can kill you. Want to live watch a good sun raise ever day . And brith the air . Don,t want my GirlFirend or my family see me die . I love life .
haha pot = not; wow
wohaaaaa drugs are bad
Well,.
You make some very good points. An important one is that designer drugs are frequently much more dangerous than other drugs. This is primarily because there is no way of knowing how the designer drug was made, and new versions are constantly popping up, making medical emergencies especially hard to treat. As far as the definition goes, agreed. NIDA will revisit that definition for inconsistencies. Thank you for your well thought out comments.

Is your family income affecting your frindships? Teen Vogue reports on class envy.
Samantha*,. "People didn't know my financial situation," she says. "My sister shopped a lot, so I borrowed her clothes. It seemed like we had excess, but in the end it was my mom taking on a lot of burdens." Samantha says blending in with her wealthy neighbors helped to increase her social status. "I think the pressure for students to fit in is a common thing. I had to act the part to keep people from thinking there was something about me that was different and so I was able to sit with the popular girls."
At a time when the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that more than 9 percent of Americans are unemployed, class divisions are widening, creating tough social situations for many teens. Though it's not commonly talked about, how much cash your parents have can often have a huge effect on your allowance, popularity, and, more importantly, who your BFFs are.
Eighteen-year-old Tiara, from Chicago, who considers herself middle-class, agrees with Samantha. "In my high school, clothes made you more popular. If you didn't have the right clothes or the latest brands, people would tear you down.".
But it's. "When you have a friend who's constantly wanting to go out for dinner every day, it puts more pressure on you," she says. "Sometimes I'll look at my credit card bill, and all those Frappuccinos and taxicab rides add up—and I'm like, I can't do this again."
Being in a different income bracket from your friends can be tough. Lisa*, nineteen, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, grew up lower-class. She remembers feeling envious when her best friend got $600 from her uncle to spend just for fun. "I was like, Whoa, can you break me off? I wasn't as fortunate as some of my friends. I've never spent more than $20 on a pair of jeans. I wore Payless until I was fourteen. And my first bike came from a garage sale."
In contrast, Ada*, 23, from York, Pennsylvania, hit it big when a company she started in high school was purchased by a larger organization. But her net worth doesn't make her worry-free. "Just because you have something doesn't mean you don't think about it," she says. "After you get money, you have to maintain it."
Ada admits she's even embarrassed by her financial status at times. "I just don't talk about it. It is something that I wish a lot of people didn't know about, because they see me as different. I eat McDonald's. I drive a Toyota Camry. I usually stay home and cook. When people get to know me, they're like, 'You're just a normal girl.'"
Paladino says."
"Transparency is really important in friendships and relationships," adds Jessie H. O'Neill, author of The Golden Ghetto: The Psychology of Affluence (The Affluenza Project). "People respect honesty." After Samantha told one of her superwealthy roommates that flaunting money made her uncomfortable, she says their friendship improved. "From then on she would split meals with me, and her parents flew me up to their house for Thanksgiving. It didn't feel like charity."
O'Neill says that maintaining harmony with your pals doesn't necessarily mean that a person with more money should always foot the bill—rather that BFFs should find common interests that don't require money, like going to the beach, bicycling, or taking walks.
Most importantly, the experts stress being sensitive toward—and not judgmental of—others in different financial situations. Listening can be an integral way to understand what a friend is going through. "It is important to not assume that their experience of life is the same as yours," says L.A.-based teen therapist Sandra Dupont. "To learn more about their situation, listen carefully to what they share and follow their lead. Try asking questions about what's important to them."
Many girls say that after they became more honest about their financial situation—with both themselves and their friends—life improved. "I would want to be richer," Lisa admits. "If you don't have any money, you're not secure. But I still appreciate what I have."
Ada says since her money was earned through doing something she loves, she doesn't dwell on it. "I don't hang out with people based on what they have. It's not an issue. I'm focused on my business."
Though Samantha still worries about her cash flow now that she's at an Ivy League university, she's less concerned about whether or not people think she's rich or poor. "Now I'm surrounded by a new level of wealth: kids with trust funds and allowances every week. It was— and still is—very tough for me." But, she says, she's less wrapped up in pretending to be something she isn't. "I've shared my true financial situation with a core set of friends. They're extraordinary people that I value, not just monetarily but for the trust and investment we have in our friendship."
*Name has been changed.

Telkomsel partners with Skype to enhance communications services
Telkomsel partners with Skype to enhance communications services
telecomasia.net
Telkomsel is announcing a partnership with Skype, a leading provider of Internet communications software. This partnership will bring Skype software beyond computers to a range of mobile handsets starting with a series of Symbian, Android and Blackberry smartphones, so consumers can take their Skype conversations with them on the go.
Under this strategic partnership, the two companies have created a whole new communications experience for Indonesian users, offering them an innovative way to connect with friends and family around the world.

Indian equipment vendor and telecoms operator Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL) has signed a technology licence agreement with Qualcomm to manufacture and sell CDMA-based mobile and fixed-wireless phones and data cards worldwide. HFCL plans to sell four million CDMA handsets worth between INR6 billion and INR8 billion (USD130 milllion-USD174 million) in domestic and international markets in the next financial year, Managing Director Mahendra Nahata told Reuters. The fast growing Indian market is the site of intense competition between CDMA and GSM-based operators, and Qualcomm hopes the agreement with HFCL will tip the balance in CDMA’s favour. ‘There are currently more than 36 million CDMA subscribers in India and the wireless market has grown ten-fold in less than five years,’ the statement quoted Nahata as.

While outsourcing specific skills and services makes sense for smaller organisations new research from HR Access suggests it does carry a risk and therefore demands you take your time, do your due-diligence, appoint the ‘right’ supplier and ensure you undertake regular performance reviews.
The report, Payroll outsourcing: could do better! confirms that while many organisations are generally satisfied with the impact and value of outsourcing on their business, there is still a feeling of discontent among many businesses. Those surveyed highlight key areas employers should get right when they embark on outsourcing.
These include the need properly to scope service requirements, implement robust account management practices, establish strong, two-way communications and push for continuous service and supplier improvements.
Roger Fullilove, senior global product manager at HR Access Solutions, outlines three key steps from the study that will get outsourcing on track from the start and ensure it delivers lasting value for your business.
(1) Thoroughly scope your requirements
Allow plenty of time to scope the services you wish to outsource. Investing time at the start of the project will significantly reduce the likelihood of needing to adjust and review your requirements during contracting and the early stages of the project, which also means you’re less likely to incur additional costs.
Remember that a supplier can only work with the information you give them so it’s important to keep them up-to-date about the specific needs, priorities and issues your business is facing or anticipates. Regular update meetings will enable you to do this and ensure they are a partner to your business, not simply a supplier.
(2) Communication is central to success
Defined communication channels and service standards for the entire length of your outsourcing contract should be established and clearly communicated. This should be done no later than the contracting stage and is designed to ensure everyone involved is aware of and understands the aims and impacts of outsourcing for the business, and the formal communication channels that support these.
(3) Measure the impact of outsourcing
If you have invested time to scope the services thoroughly you are outsourcing, and have negotiated a high quality of service standard, you will be in a strong position to assess the value and impact of it on your business. As at every stage of the process remember to work in partnership with your vendor to create and regularly review a set of relevant service indicators – both quantitative and qualitative – to measure, monitor and benchmark performance.
Such KPIs are of high value not only at regular operational service reviews, where they enable you to identify any emerging issues and quickly nip them in the bud, but also at the less frequent strategic business reviews, which are designed to check outsourcing is having the expected impacts and delivering the promised benefits to the business.
Nick Holley from Henley Business School agrees that outsourcing can deliver real business impact and benefit but acknowledges that, like so many business solutions, although the concept is great it can often fall down when it comes to implementation. To make outsourcing implementation a success he recommends three additional key areas to focus on to ensure outsourcing can work for your business.
“The first is to consider the impact of outsourcing on the end user. While it might save central costs it’s important to ask whether it’s adding hidden local costs such as line managers spending more time on administration and are hence diverted from serving customers and motivating people.
"The second area to look at is the quality of the data you can provide your outsourcing partner. Really think whether you have robust, up to date data and clear processes and accountabilities to make outsourcing effective. Finally, ask whether the outsourcer can demonstrate the value they are offering you.”

“The primary purpose of any joint stock enterprise from healthcare to banking is to make its owners money. The optimal structure is a monopoly. Next best is to collude with competitors to control prices. This is inherently more efficient in private because it prevents competition. As collusion is always unpopular, participants must be over-rewarded for their silence.”
Any traveller who fails to understand this cynical but unfortunately self-evident truth is guaranteed to end up in the wrong place.
The hysterical reaction to the widening Libor price-fixing scandal demonstrates a lack of knowledge of how businesses have worked since the first caveman made an axe (doubtlessly then killing his neighbour who was designing a better model).
The number of participant banks and employees worldwide make it inconceivable that these arrangements were not generally known. Globally, “bbalibor” covers 10 currencies, each with 15 maturities - ie interbank interest rates over various periods - making 150 rate fixings every business day.
And it was known - there were many good articles on the topic from 2007. This leaves bank directors, regulators and politicians with unpleasant choices. Either they were unaware, and so incompetent; or they knew but carried on, so were reckless and skirting with criminality. Most probably they chose not to look, so were negligent.
Another serious implosion in the financial system will increase the already high and often justifiable mistrust of all investment managers, whether sinner or saint.
At Bedlam we at least tried to start in the right place, and so hold no financial companies for clients. This was also the case for three years from 2006, not because we foresaw the specifics or timing of the crash, but because the balance sheets of banks and insurance companies were so opaque as to defy analysis.
Where analysis was possible, the valuations, over-borrowing, lack of adequate provisioning and hubris ensured a future implosion. Such prudence was of little benefit - between January and August 2009 bank shares soared, for example RBS rose from £1.03 to £5.76 before collapsing back to £2.15.
Yet financial shares remain unattractive because the Libor fiasco should be a game changer. Since 2007 there has been a woeful lack of reform. Hopefully, the pressure is now sufficient that the Bank, the Treasury and politicians will develop rudimentary spines and do what they have long promised: reduce the absolute sizes of the leading banks, separate their businesses and penalise the use of often pointless synthetic products.
Small is safer because it reduces systemic and national risk. Such changes will be slow and will effect bank profitability. This will be exacerbated by their need to continue shrinking their balance sheets and because they continue to under-provide for bad debts.
Sadly, other necessary and larger reforms will be ducked. At the root of all financial crises is a similar fault - a lack of transparency. All derivative trades, pricing agreements and submissions (such as those to set Libor rates) should be visible at the time and across a public exchange.
If all trades can be seen and tracked, the scope for fraud diminishes. Yet regulators maintain a hostile twitch to real transparency. Not only does transparency reduce their power and purpose, it casts an unwelcome light on how they operate, from the arcane and opaquely appointed Court of Directors of the Bank of England through to the multiple failures of both the Bank and Financial Services Authority.

London's blue-chips started the week on a downbeat note and retreated from four-and-a-half year highs, with falls in Vodafone and Meggitt shares helping to drag the FTSE 100 lower.
Analyst downgrades hit both companies and the benchmark index lost 0.3pc in early deals, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 was little changed at 13,277 points. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, argued the FTSE 100 could see further resistance ahead.
"Even if this is a pause before another up move, could 6,400 prove a significant hurdle?" he said, adding that the potential obstacle was "being largely ignored amid all the bullishness".
Vodafone, which is due to update the market on its latest trading on Thursday, was one of the heaviest fallers and lost 1.8pc after Citigroup analysts advised investors to take profits after the stock's recent strong run. The experts at the broker noted that Vodafone shares have returned 11pc so far in 2013, and cut the mobile giant to "neutral" from "buy".
Meanwhile, engineer Meggitt also shed 1.7pc on a downgrade to "neutral from "buy" at UBS.
"We recently reduced our full-year earnings before interest, tax, and amortization forecasts from £401m to £391m, now in line with consensus, because of lower commercial aftermarket expectations," said analysts at the bank. "We expect Meggitt will achieve £391m, but we are not convinced they will beat it convincingly and do not expect material upgrades to 2013."
The UBS scribblers further disappointed investors by arguing a takeover of the company was now unlikely.
At the other end of the table, strong full-year results saw investors chase gold miner Randgold Resources to the top of the FTSE 100. The company said 2012 profit climbed 16pc and boosted its dividend by 25pc, sending the shares up 3.9pc.
Broadcaster ITV was also bolstered by an upgrade at Credit Suisse, which lifted its target price to 125p from 110p. The shares advanced 2pc in early trade.

The Treasury is set to freeze the amount that people can inherit free of tax instead of increasing it in line with inflation.
The allowance will be frozen at £325,000 despite George Osborne, the Chancellor, just eight weeks ago saying that he would increase the amount in two years.
The rate will now not go up until at least 2019, according to The Sunday Times, meaning that thousands of families will be £95,000 worse off than if the allowance had risen.
The measures would see 5,000 more people paying inheritance tax and are expected to contribute about £1 billion over the next five years towards the cost of care home bills for the elderly.
Under those plans pensioners with savings of up to £123,000 are to receive state support with their care costs under Government plans.
In a long-awaited coalition announcement, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, will say that the assets threshold will rise from £23,250 to £123,000, with a sliding scale of support.
The means-tested threshold is higher than the £100,000 assets limit recommended by the independent Dilnot Commission appointed by Mr Osborne.
Up to 40,000 people a year currently face having to sell their homes to afford care bills, such as help with washing, dressing and feeding themselves – a situation repeatedly condemned by the Prime Minister when he was in opposition.
Ministers will claim that the new social care funding system will offer “unprecedented” financial support for elderly people and that it is being set at the right level given the continuing pressures on the public finances.
The £75,000 cap will apply to every pensioner. If both husband and wife end up moving into residential care, it could mean they will have to pay up to £150,000 before the state steps in.
Based on an average care home stay of two years, this means a couple could still spend £200,000 on fees for a basic care home.
Under the new system, once a care home resident has spent £75,000 on fees, the state will step in and pay the basic rate for any more care required.
Before that point, it will also protect some assets and savings.
When a pensioner’s assets are drained down to £123,000, the state will meet some of the costs of care. Just the last £14,000 of savings are expected to be fully protected, as in the current system.
Once the state steps in, it will only pay for basic care, which will not necessarily meet the standards that the resident was previously paying for.
If pensioners are paying bills for care homes which are higher than the rates that councils will pay, they could be forced to move to cheaper institutions or to seek family help to pay “top-up” fees.
Ministers will also claim nobody will be forced to sell their home in their lifetime – with everyone given the right to defer paying until after their death.

The antipathy between supporters of these clubs cuts so deep that Burnley town centre resembled a security state on a Sunday morning.
Around Turf Moor, policemen positioned themselves on roof tops, helicopters hovered in the sky, streets were cordoned off and several pubs were shut.
Despite being just 11 miles down the M65, there was something Orwellian about the fact that 3,347 visiting fans were ordered to arrive at Ewood Park two and a half hours before kick-off and travel in a cavalcade of official coaches escorted by the regional establishment.
The tension permeated onto the pitch with two mid-table sides indicating why neither is likely to finish much higher this season.
Having arrived as a substitute three minutes earlier, Burnley’s Sam Vokes scored a deserved equaliser via the same route that had given Blackburn the lead; a cross into the box and a header, this one dispatched by Jordan Rhodes.
Burnley, indeed, should have capitalised on a first half performance where domination was absolute.
The host’s, however, had not beaten Blackburn in 33 years and the weight of such unflattering history appeared to prey on the mind at crucial times; like when Charlie Austin – the most prolific scorer in the country – did not convert a header, despite being unmarked.
Blackburn, meanwhile, under new manager Henning Berg had regressed in terms of results since the departure of Steve Kean and confidence was initially brittle.
They dared not lose this one and safety was the first resort. By the end of the first half, Rhodes and Colin Kazim-Richards had given up on chasing the long-balls from a defence entrenched deep in its own half.
Burnley had an extra man in midfield and that allowed them to take control. Ross Wallace, left footed but playing on the right, was reliably the source of creativity.
First he supplied Kieran Trippier whose cross caught everyone out, Austin swung at it and Scott Dann blocked.
From another Wallace ball, Austin brought the very best out of Paul Robinson; the former England goalkeeper scooping the header off the goalline with his left hand. Moments later, Robinson used his right hand to tip around the post from Dean Marney.
Blackburn’s sole response was a shot from Rhodes that sailed high into the upper tier of the Jimmy McIlory Stand.
In the second half, though, and with supply arriving regularly from the impressive Mauro Formica, Blackburn improved and took the lead when Rhodes prodded in the Argentine’s delivery.
The moment shocked Burnley whose boss Sean Dyche responded by sending on three attackers. Two of them, Junior Stanislas and Vokes, conspired to rescue a point.

Visakhapatnam: There must surely have been pressure within, but Yuvraj Singh looked rather relaxed early on Saturday, which was supposed to be the “second-biggest day” of his career.
The first, in Yuvraj’s book, is April 2, 2011, when India regained the World Cup after 28 years and he was adjudged the Player of the Tournament.
But as it was to be the start of a fresh innings, here, The Telegraph asked Yuvraj if he remembered his thoughts on the morning of his debut, against Kenya, in the October 2000 ICC KnockOut.
Laughing, Yuvraj recalled: “Actually, I had to take sleeping pills as Sourav (Ganguly, the captain) had, the previous evening, asked ‘open karega kya’?... I’d replied I would, but that was more out of bravado...
“I just couldn’t sleep, out of nervousness and took sleeping pills... At breakfast, though, Sourav clarified he’d only been joking... ‘Mazaak kar raha tha main’... That relaxed me.”
Four years later, Yuvraj ‘repaid’ Sourav.
“I’d promised Sourav that I’d also play a prank... Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) and I did exactly that, on April Fool’s Day, when we were in Pakistan on the Revival tour...
“We arranged a printout of an imaginary interview of Sourav, where he’d been critical of his players... When that was shown to him, he pleaded he hadn’t given any such interview...
“Sourav went from player to player, claiming innocence... Later, of course, he was furious when Rahul Dravid told him that Bhajji and I had pulled a fast one. He then chased us in the dressing room!”
For his part, Sourav remembered the prank played on him, but didn’t recall having (jokingly) asked Yuvraj to open on his debut.
Regulars Sourav and Sachin Tendulkar opened, with India chasing down 209 for the loss of two wickets in under 43 overs. Yuvraj wasn’t required to bat, but he’d bowled four overs.
Yuvraj’s first India captain, however, is delighted that he’s back on the big stage.
Speaking exclusively, Sourav said: “Yuvi’s gone through a lot... I’m very happy for him now... Initially, I was concerned whether he’d recovered physically, but obviously he has.”
Asked if he had a message for Yuvraj, Sourav was quick to reply: “Indeed, yes... Keep hitting them in the stands!”
Rain prevented Yuvraj from having a go at the Dr YSR Stadium, so one has to wait till the Chepauk (on Tuesday), at least.

What: Excel, a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Eastern Institute of Management (EIM), in association with The Telegraph.
When: September 29.
Where: Vidya Mandir.
Music, dance, mime and masti — it was an affair to remember on Saturday as students and staff of EIM got together to celebrate their 10th anniversary, and shared their special day with students of a few other business schools. At the inauguration, EIM director Amit Sengupta spoke about the institute’s decade-long journey and how each member of the EIM family had contributed to its success.
After the opening ceremony, students of the host institute took the stage to depict the many moods experienced by students on campus, dancing to popular numbers like Disco deewane and Ekla cholo re, sung by Amitabh Bachchan in Kahaani.
Next up were the students of the Army Institute of Management, who staged a skit parodying current events in the country. Their humorous take on the necessity of real-life heroes and the near-perfect imitation of celebrities and politicians left everyone in splits. The fun act was followed by a fashion show by the students of EIM, Army Institute of Management and the International School of Business.
Pushpak Dance Group’s impressive kathak recital portrayed the four seasons. The final and the most-awaited gig of the evening was by the band Krosswindz, who caused the young audience to go wild as they belted out numbers like Summer of ’69, We Will Rock You, Bhebey dekhechho ki and Doriyay ailo toofan.
“It was incredible! Each college performed to its best. The event was a moment of pride for both the students and teachers of EIM,” said Moumita Das, an EIM student of the 2013 batch.

Redesigned Full-Sized Apple iPad 5 To Be Unveiled This Month?
April 4, 2013 | 4:45 pm
It’s been awhile since we last heard a quasi-believable next-gen iPad story, but it shouldn’t be long now until we get something conclusive. That’s because several sources claim a new full-sized iPad is closing in on its release, with the official unveiling rumored to happen by the end of this month.
But is that possible? We’d be inclined to say no, because, again, there have been far too few iPad 5 rumors lately and Apple is usually very skilled at building hype months before an actual release.
Then again, with the third-gen iPad released in March 2012 and the fourth-generation back in...
(Time-Limited) Deal Alert: Refurbished Apple iPad 4 With Verizon LTE Available for $500
March 18, 2013 | 5:12 pm
There is no doubt in our minds that Apple’s fourth-generation 9.7-inch iPad is the most spectacular to date, and almost certainly the best-ever conceived tablet. The only catch is that it doesn’t exactly come cheap. At best, you can find one at $500 with 16 GB of on-board storage and Wi-Fi.
If you also want 4G LTE speeds, you have to be ready to fork out roughly $120-$130 more. Then again, if you don’t need a new iPad, you can save a few bucks by choosing a refurbished model instead.
Apple put a few of those up for grabs via its U.S. Store last week,......

Some town. Bells ring, and singing comes from a loudspeaker throughout the city. People walk in slo-mo. The RV is parked. The kids get a message on their crazy cell phone. It's their recovery mission. Missy Elliott plays as they read that they have to drive to a place called Fes, and their GPS will lead them to their crest. As they read the instructions, they read out the name of the GPS maker, continuing the wonderful tradition of B/M commercial spot bullshit. I would call them sellouts, but from what would they be selling out? Adam voice-overs that he'll do whatever it takes to make sure no one has to get the boot. Jisela then voice-overs that she's already preparing herself to get the boot. Good. The kids have parked in an empty-looking area while Jisela babbles on the possibility of someone else failing and whether that means she would still get the boot. Yeah, probably. The kids walk.
The Six of Suck arrive in some ruins. They don't know what they're looking for, so they just wander around. Ellen is wearing short shorts. The girl does not learn. Finally, in a very staged shot, Adam and Ellen sit by a hole and yell, "C'mere. We've found something." We get a shot from a camera down the hole, I guess (though they then don't even use the camera to get a shot during the actual mission), of a snake guarding the crest. Adam floats that he hates snakes, but that he'll go do it anyway. He gets scared and jumps back out and a rock becomes dislodged and hits him in the head. Hee. Of course, knowing stupid-ass B/M, we don't get a shot of any of this, and rather we just get Adam emerging, a tiny trickle of blood on his nose. Oh whatever, he's fine. Burn your hands off, and then come talk to me. I do still hope someone dies on one of these shows and B/M gets sued and they have to go live in a box. With Steve. Anyway, Steve goes down, and screams, but throws the piece of the crest up. They complete their mission, and Steve emerges, happy. Music plays, but no one cares. We get a montage, because this episode was just that goddamn exciting, as Sophia tells us again what we saw this week and how great they are, and superimposed we get a shot of the word "Determination" from the "ancient" crest piece. She says, "Now that's determination." Oh, fuck off. Really. Bring back the Semester at Sea, even. Jisela then voice-overs again about the Quest for the Crest being about their collecting virtues it takes to make a person and then they'll become whole, or some shit. I don't know. Jisela talks to the camera, saying that she came in thinking she was going to rule, but now she learned her weaknesses and "Road Rules is going to help [her] deal with that." God. This show. Killing me already. Why not at least give me a few weeks before you take me down?

Commercials. The WB presents What I Like About You. Come on, Amanda Bynes. It's time to move on, already.
Smallville High School at night. Only it looks like a drawing of the school, not an actual filmed shot. Maybe that's just my imagination. Clarkionel is inside in the Torch newsroom, trying to log in to the LuthorCorp corporate network. He's still wearing Clark's nice blue shirt. The website won't accept his password. Clarkionel slams his hand on the desk, taking out a huge chunk of wood with his fist. "Lex," he whispers angrily. "He changed the password." Did you think he wouldn't?
Chloe, wearing a navel-baring olive top and chunky jewelry, comes in carrying a few binders. She notices Clark's fashion statement. "Was flannel too five-minutes-ago?" she asks. She notices the desk fisting and asks, "Who pulled a Paul Bunyan on the desk?" "It was that way when I got here," Clarkionel says playfully. "Weird," says Chloe. Why doesn't Chloe come to the conclusion that Kryptonite-infected termites are to blame? Clarkionel starts playing his little mind games, telling Chloe that he's concerned about her well-being, and asking what she'd do if Papa Luthor got out of prison. She asks if the "Lionel Luthor alert has suddenly been elevated to orange." Clarkionel smiles smugly. She asks if he knows something she doesn't. Clarkionel rolls toward Chloe in the office chair. "Nooo," he drawls out, "but it always pays to be cautious." Chloe dismisses his concerns; she says Papa Luthor won't be eligible for parole until he's about 112. Clarkionel starts to move toward Chloe as he says that Papa Luthor may get out sooner than she thinks. Chloe backs away, laughing and telling Clark that he's been sacked one too many times. Football, people, football. Don't get naughty on me, here. Clarkionel says that may be true. He says he feels like he's looking at Chloe through a different pair of eyes. He licks his lips. Total Raising Victor Vargas move, that. He says he sees her in a whole new light. Chloe asks what that means. Clarkionel leans in for the kill: "I have to confess that I...I find you absolutely fascinating." Chloe looks at him, falling for the treacherous hook. He says it's the twinkle in her eye...that sexy smile...wait, it's Papa Luthor! Ew! He touches her face with his finger and starts talking about her skin. "Clark, what are you doing?" Chloe asks. Don't you find me...pleasing? Clarkionel closes his eyes a little and says it's what he's wanted to do for a very, very long time. He leans in for a kiss. Chloe closes her eyes and moves to kiss him back. Clarkionel exhales at her. "Don't you wish," he whispers. Daaaaaaamn! Cold-blooded! Chloe is shocked. "Miss Sullivan," Clarkionel says, off to the side, and walks off. Chloe is left with tears brimming in her eyes. Wow. Magnificent Bastardom in a male-model package! Who knew it was possible?

Ten years after the formation of an exceptional group, Telluride Medical Center unveils a plaque
Ten years ago, a group of local citizens recognized a need for capital equipment at the Telluride Medical Center and decided to take action. The Telluride Medical Capital Fund was formed and over $1 million was raised.
To commemorate the 10-year anniversary of that effort, the Telluride Medical Capital Fund was recently recognized by the Telluride Medical Center.
“The efforts of the Capital Fund committee were a remarkable demonstration of initiative and community support,” said Bill Grun, Telluride Hospital District board president.
The Telluride Medical Captial Fund operated under the auspices of the Telluride Foundation, providing the Telluride Medical Center with the ability to purchase state-of-the-art equipment including an ultrasound, digital x-ray, and CT scanner. Along with a complete list of capital fund equipment purchases, the plaque recognizes the efforts made by Capital Fund committee members: Ron Allred; C. Michael Armstrong; Harmon Brown; Davis Fansler; Dr. Richard Houck; Harvey Roisman; Norman Sacker; Tom Schwartz; Terry Stephens; and Steven Wald.
From conception the Telluride Medical Capital Fund was slated to expire as soon as the funding was completed and the Telluride Medical Center was operating profitably.
“Through the hard work and generosity of the community, the Med Center’s Board of Directors and management, and the Fund Committee, we were able to accomplish our goal in only five years,” said Mike Armstrong, a Capital Fund committee member.
The committee hosted an annual gala event called F.E.A.S.T., an acronym for “Funds for Expanding And Supporting Telluride’s Medical Center.”
“We felt the community would respond by invitation to a nice dinner party that raised funds with ticket sales and auction items,” said Armstrong.
The committee was correct: in only five years over $1 million in capital funds was raised through the annual event. The last F.E.A.S.T. was held in 2007, only five years after the fund was created. Grun said: “
The Capital Fund has had a positive and enduring impact on the Telluride Medical Center, we just wouldn’t be where we are today without the special efforts of the Telluride Medical Capital Fund.”
The plaque is on display at the Telluride Foundation.

While rivals Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic slug it out for the Dubai championship this week, world No. 1 Rafael Nadal is home in Mallorca where Spaniard has been recovering from a thigh injury and more recently honing his acting skills by shooting a commercial.
In the video below, Nadal was on location at Manacor’s Plaza de sa Bassa yesterday to film an ad for the Spanish bank Banesto. It looks like Nadal’s girlfriend Xisca Perello in also on the scene to make sure her man Rafa is up to snuff.
Nadal is scheduled to return to tennis next weekend when Spain travels to Belgium for a Davis Cup first round match.
Filed under: Videos Tags: Commercials, Rafael Nadal
Omg, I just got on here to ask where’s Rafa and when he’ ll be playing again. Questions answered!
February 25th, 2011 at 6:19 pm
I am glad Rafa will be back playing tennis soon!
February 25th, 2011 at 10:33 pm
Love u Rafa…
February 26th, 2011 at 3:32 am
Where did you see or hear mention of the girlfriend? She is NOT in this video.
It’s grandfather Nadal who is making sure young Rafel is ‘up to snuff’ from the window of his home overlooking the plaza where the commercial (for Banesto) was being shot.
February 26th, 2011 at 5:41 am
The lady fixing Rafa’s collar is NOT Xisca, though she has a similar look. Xisca is younger and prettier! Good to see Rafa, can’t wait for his return to tennis!
February 26th, 2011 at 1:35 pm
definitely not xisca. but he looks great! whatever they did to his hair? never seen it look better.
yeah. have to say i do miss rafa when he’s not playing.

Experienced Chilean and former World No. 5 Fernando Gonzalez has been given medical clearance to come back to the professional tour, announcing on his Twitter account Monday, "Today I finish my 6 months post-op rehab. I was discharged and ready to go back to game."
Gonzalez is currently ranked at No. 395 2011 ATP Rankings, went through a surgery on his right hip on 4 October after coming to an abrupt halt within just two matches following Roland Garros. He will make his first tournament appearance since the retirement at the US Open as a wild card entry later this month at the Serbia Open 2011.
New coach Horacio Matta has been training the winner of 11 ATP Titles, Gonzalez for a few weeks in the United States.

Below Par
September 8, 2010 -- Players baked under intense sun, heat and humidity the first week of The U. S. Open. Hurricane Earl then skirted by with promises of relief. But what it deposited in its wake was wind. And it just hasn't stopped.
Stanislaus Wawrinka and Sam Querrey showed fans what wind does to your tennis game. Both were affected from the shifting gusts. From one end of the giant arena wind came from behind, pushing balls like a tailwind on jets. From the other end, they rallied against the wind.
Their games, which they'd polished for the last major of the year, were on hold. They shifted gears and survived, Wawrinka (#25 seed) playing the odds and the wind better than the American.
Vera Zvonareva and Kaia Kanepi rocked and rolled with the wind today, too, during their quarterfinal match on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Neither woman really hit her stride. They tried their best, one point at a time.
But the more seasoned player -- Zvonareva -- maintained a better average game than Kanepi, winning 63 75.
For that she was rewarded a berth in the semifinals at the 2010 U. S. Open -- her first.
"I had to find the right balance between patience and watching the ball," Zvonareva said to Brad Gilbert on court moments after her win.
Gael Monfils and Novak Djokovic were also treated to the swirling energy on Ashe, in their quarterfinal match. Djokovic (#3 seed) might have been thrown by conditions early on, but he adapted.
Monfils (#17 seed), on the other hand, floundered. He didn't have a strategy; he didn't seem to think about what he did, after initially breaking Novak early in the first set. However, he couldn't put enough on the ball to pressure Djokovic, and when he did, the balls flew. Monfils fed balls back to the center of the court where Djokovic stood contentedly controlling everything.
Djokovic won the last sixteen out of twenty-one games, securing his third consecutive spot in the semifinals of the U. S. Open.
Experience had won out in both of these matches.
Zvonareva (#7 seed) and Kanepi (#31 seed) were playing in their first-ever quarterfinal match at the U. S. Open. There were nerves, of course, as they worked toward the common goal.
The match was riddled with breaks of serve and unforced errors. Kanepi wracked up 60 unforced errors to 18 winners. She double faulted 9 times and threw them in at ill-timed moments -- when she was about to break back, again, or close a game.
"I couldn't find my rhythm or control the ball," Kanepi said in her press conference. "And, Vera played very well."
Kanepi rushed from point to point, and acted annoyed and impatient. However, when her first serve hit its mark the Estonia woman hammered flat, deep groundstrokes at Zvonareva, successfully running her from one side of the court to the other.
Zvonareva quickly smartened up to Kanepi's one-dimensional strategy. The Russian kept the ball in play. She didn't have to do anything else, really, especially in the first set.
The match entertained fans with extended points and escalating squeals, though. One such point had 27 rallies.
Zvonareva showed tenacity under extremely adverse conditions. She also showed maturity, which in the past has been under examination. Last year in her quarterfinal match against Flavia Pennetta, Zvonareva had the biggest meltdown of the tournament.
Up comfortably in the last set, Zvonareva opened the door to Pennetta. The Italian upped her level of competition to the thrill of fans in Louis Armstrong Stadium while the air leaked from Zvonareva sails. She skidded and fell at one point and proceeded to rip off the strapping on her legs. She whaled on it, hitting herself repeatedly in the thigh as she sat there. She cried from frustration. She lost the match.
The Zvonareva who won today certainly had matured. She easily could have had similar tantrums given the conditions and occasion. But she had moved on and was rightfully rewarded.
Gael Monfils was excited for his moment on the big stage of Arthur Ashe Stadium, he told the press yesterday. He was honored.
The gifted man with explosive energy and breath-taking athleticism looked as if he'd dropped his shenanigans, from the look of earlier rounds. He shelved the histrionics, chest thumping, and rally cries. He concentrated, controlling his tendencies to distract himself from the match at hand.
He lasted five difficult sets against qualifier Robbie Kendrick, in the first round. Took care of Igor Andreev in the second. Put an end to Janko Tipsarevic's high from defeating Andy Roddick, in the third. Then, defeated his friend Richard Gasquet next, in straight sets.
On paper no one gave Monfils the edge in this match. Only if he contained himself and played lights-out tennis would he have pushed Djokovic aside. But the windy conditions, plus the inability to produce an alternative strategy, killed off any possibility of mounting a comeback after losing the first set tiebreak.
"I tried to stay focused," Djokovic said after his victory. "These were the worse conditions of the tournament, so far."
Djokovic's masterful ground game was spot on, even in the wind. Later in the match, he successfully approached the net and volleyed winners, as Monfils stood ten feet behind the baseline.
Both players produced more unforced errors, than winners. However, Djokovic won 69% of points on his first serve and a robust 50% of points off his second serve. Enough to win 76 (2) 61 62.
No one has talked much about Novak Djokovic, so far. His win today, though, will shift the attention. His consistent three-peat performance into the semifinals is a record he should be proud of. The person who has stopped his pursuit of the title is Roger Federer.
Federer defeated Djokovic in his first U. S. Open final in 2007, and in the two semifinals in 2008 and 2009. Djokovic will have to play him again this year, too, as the #2 seed beat a hot Robin Soderling later Wednesday night on a windy Ashe

Integral to the formation of the Tern and Plover Conservation Partnership was Jeanine Lackey’s 1990 – 1991 study, “Planning Strategies and Recommendations for the Protection of Least Terns and Piping Plovers at Sand and Gravel Mines Along the Lower Platte and Loup Rivers, Nebraska.” Jeanine worked with sand and gravel mine operators to identify situations that would interfere with nesting birds and developed management procedures that minimized disruption to both mining operations and nesting birds. Jeanine found that placing wire mesh exclosures around Piping Plover nests and electric fences around entire colonies of terns and plovers increased the number of chicks produced and the survival of the nesting adults.
Jeanine Lackey
Caption from Mary
Between 1994 and 1998, Least Tern and Piping Plover protection in Nebraska was sporadic at best simply because there were not enough people available to monitor the birds effectively. Out of concern for the birds, John Dinan (Nebraska Game and Parks Commission) and Jeanine Lackey (Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and University of Nebraska-Lincoln) submitted funding proposals to the Nebraska Environmental Trust and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in 1998 to remedy the situation. John and Jeanine believed that a special group of people dedicated to protecting terns and plovers in Nebraska was needed given the potential for unpleasant bird-people conflicts. In 1999, John and Jeanine were joined by Ron Johnson (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) and founded the Tern and Plover Conservation Partnership. A Program Coordinator was hired in 1999 to oversee the program and in 2002 an Outreach Coordinator was hired to recruit volunteers and to develop an education program.

Bald Eagle Hike
Operated by: TerraMar Adventures
Event Leader: Carl
, MD 0
The bald eagle, symbol of our nation, is perhaps one of the most majestic birds in the world. Some of us have been lucky enough to see them soaring high above. But, few ever get to see them close or, better yet, hunting prey. This is a must do adventure!
The bald eagle was considered endangered until June 28, 2007, with the side effects of DDT having decimated populations in the 1950's. But, its return is one of our greatest conservation success story. Rebounging from a low of 417 nesting pairs in 1963, in 2006 it was estimated that there are now more than 9,700 nesting pairs in North America.
This adventure begins with a hike along the Susquehanna Riverto get our blood pumping and enjoy the crisp winter air. As we hike, keep your eyes to the trees because at any moment you could encounter a bald eagle. But, at the turnaround point, prepare to be amazed because we are hiking to an amazing spot where an annual migration of bald eagles congregates around the dam.
It is reported that more than one hundred species of birds are drawn here by the giant turbines that suck water, and fish, through the dam to produce electricity. As the fish are sucked through the dam, many are temporarily stunned and float vulnerably near the surface as they exit.
Its a bad story for the fish, but a great story for us because, as they are stunned, they are easy prey for migrating bald eagles and other birds.
Do not miss this adventure! The bald eagles are only here for a few weeks as they migrate for the winter. You will kick yourself if you miss this one.Make sure to bring a camera and/or binoculars.
This event is limited to 15 people. The first 15 to pay go.

broken 1st and 5th metacarpi. see a specialist??
took a bad fall today. broke my hand in two spots. doc at the urgent care place said i needed a specialist, which i cannot afford (plus tomorrow's gonna be a powder day). will duct tape work instead?
and something felt wrong about the splint, so i took it off and damned if it doesn't match my right hand perfectly. another reason i don't really trust doc at the urgent care center.
Maybe it's just the climber in me, but don't mess around with your hand or fingers. Get that shit taken care of.
No idea what's wrong with your splint. Maybe he's an idiot, which is even more reason to get it checked by someone who knows what he/she's doing."Alpine rock and steep, deep powder are what I seek, and I will always find solace there." - Bean Bowers
shroom put it best: "Man, you're one biased motherfucker."
I'm no expert, but I did stay at a holiday inn suites last night.
That looks like something that's going to require hardware.
I'd at least start with an ortho. The ortho group I went to for my knee has specialists in several areas including hands. Of course my insurance company required me to go to my primary care physician (waste of time and money) first to get a script for the ortho.
If you're going to be paying for all of this out of pocket (no insurance) then I'd cut out the middle-man and look for either a hand specialist, or an ortho group that includes a hand specialist.
Sorry man, heal up quick!Wag more, bark less
I've broken metacarples before and some didn't set right even with a cast. Had to have them rebroken and plated. Get them plated if you can. They seem to be in decent placement but by now you're realizing how much you miss using your hands. By the time they heal I would bet they won't be in such decent placement cause it's hard not to use your hands. If you're more worried about a powder day than what's gonna happen when you crash and your bones get more displaced (possibly damaging more stuff) I don't see this working out for you. I would be talking to a hand surgeon. If you can't afford it is there any way you can get medical assistance?
Even with a great hand surgeon, my finger isn't quite straight and causes problems. It's been about 10 years and it still bugs me a bit.

Even with a great hand surgeon, my finger isn't quite straight and causes problems. It's been about 10 years and it still bugs me a bit.)

shroom put it best: "Man, you're one biased motherfucker."
For accuracy's sake it's a 2nd metacarpal fracture not a 1st. We would fix that even in Canada.
Do you still have full range of motion in your hand?
When I was 15 I did a number on my hand (the old self-inflicted thing). Doc had to consult over the phone, but I was fine. Never had a full cast, just a splint. Can't even see the bump anymore.
YMMVNo longer stuck.
Don't be stupid, those fractures look to be spiral, those will not heal easily and would probably need fixation.
- ... jfost is really ignorant, he often just needs simple facts laid out for him...
I broke one of those bones once (the pinky side). The alignment was worse so the ER Dr. snapped it back into place -not fun- and he advised me to see a specialist. Since you've got two...
Spiral MC fractures generally get surgery, don't screw around with it this. Your 2nd MC looks angulated as well. Spiral + angulated = no heal so good.
On a related note, one of the first doctors I saw (we had kick ass insurance) was a plastic surgeon. Apparently, since hands and the like are so complicated, hands and whatnot fall within their realm of specialization. Yes, I asked for boobs. I mean, shit, I was 15 and I'd still do that at 27!No longer stuck.
The candor and honesty of the TGR forums is truly something to behold!
Sent from my DROID X2 using TGR ForumsWag more, bark less
If you don't get it fixed properly it will continue to break. Did the same thing last year before Christmas and had to have screws put in my 5th metacarpal. 25k. See if you can get CPMS if you don't have insurance.
ok so here's the update after 17 days. both bones seem to be healing. but prolly not well. i have been through extensive skihab, but no treatment. been wearing a soft cast that i change whenever i change clothes. i have slomobility in all fingers but can't make a fist with them. this seems to be due at least partially to the center knuckle joints on the fingers (especially the 2 that didn't break (ligament damage?)). The hand is obviously not completely healed and spends most of the time wrapped up. Anyway, i guess the main point is things are going as well as can be expected given the complete lack of treatment.
I tied a shoestring today. It took 5 tries, i couldn't do it in public, and it wasn't tight but each day gets better.
Note: if they have to be rebroke, they will heal worse and they will likely have to take bone grafts from other parts of your body and try to fuse the two parts of your metacarple together. Really wish you would try to find financial help. This worked out bad for me and your situation is worse. Just trying to be helpful and not negative. What you are going through now has to suck. Once things are plated life is way less painful. You won't be able to ski unless you want to risk more surgery but your hands will work better for the rest of your life. Your life is a long time. I like to learn from other peoples mistakes and this is your chance to learn from mine..

rereading my last post i can see why i was misunderstood. it prolly won't change what you said but my main point was i think things are going well. every day gets better. when i said things weren't healing well i meant not everything seems to be straight, but they seem to be healing well and quickly.
there are some irregularities.
1. my index knuckle doesn't appear to be as far out the hand as before and as compared to the other hand.
2. there is an obvious bump/mound where the bone is out of place on top of the 2nd metacarpal. it's noticeable when you point it out, but otherwise not
3. there is a v shaped gap between the third and fourth fingers starting at the knuckle and getting slightly wider toward the fingertips. not sure if this is ligament related or just the new shape of my hand
4. the pinky rotates/curl under the fourth finger more than is normal when making a fist. it doesn't appear to affect anything at this point.
i used it a lot today without the brace. lightly scratching a girls back for 30 minutes (good p-t), held a fork (sort of), tied shoe, held a pipe and manipulated the carb and more, but nothing with any force or weight. even so, these were things i couldn't do yesterday. i came closer to making a fist today than yesterday. and i've skied 14 of the 19 days since the injury, so overall i'm very happy with where things are at this point.
my main concern at this point is letting it heal strong enough that it doesn't rebreak, which is where the maple milk comes in.
Bone healing doesn't tend to be the problem in metacarpal fractures - it's the position in which the bones heal. One of the biggest issues in metacarpal fractures isn't just the angulation (i.e., the "bump" your noticing), it's also the rotation of the bone, which is why your pinky is now curling under your fourth finger when you make a fist. This rotation tends to be the bigger functional problem in the long run. As others have suggested, my recommendation is that you see a hand surgeon immediately (meaning, tomorrow), but you likely have started healing to an extent that makes corrective surgery more difficult.Originally Posted by jm2e:

April, 2011The 100-4-100 art for scholarships auction will be held Saturday, April 16 in the Joann Cole Mitte Building at Texas State University-San Marcos.
The events, held in Gallery I and II, begin with a preview and pre-registration at 6:30 p.m., with the bid sheets opening at 7 p.m.
“This event provides a great opportunity for those who appreciate and are interested in owning some amazing original works of art for only a portion of the value, while at the same time adding to the much needed scholarship funding for Texas State students,” said Mary Mikel Stump, gallery director for the School of Art & Design. “It is most gratifying to see an effort like this--faculty, alumni, students and friends joining hands to support what is truly the best thing we do here: educate our student artists.”
During the event, 100 works of art, each starting at $100, will be offered in a silent auction that will raise money for scholarships. The evening party will culminate in a live auction where three selected works will be offered in an active bidding format. In addition, there will be a raffle of selected artworks with tickets priced at $5 dollars each, so there will be an opportunity to participate at many different price levels.
The artworks are donated by artists, faculty, alumni, students and friends of the School of Art & Design. There will be a cash bar and complimentary hors d’oeuvres available.

Salvete Omnes,
Well at the ripe old age of 37 I've decided to undertake a long-held ambition of learning Latin and I've decided to use the Wheelock text to guide me in my efforts.
I've just written a program to generate flashcards to assist me in my vocabulary aquisition but I'm a little uncertain whether some of the text should be placed on the front or back of the card. Take the following vocabulary entries from Wheelock:
nomen, nominis, n., name
Should the gender identification "n." be with the Latin or with the English translation on the reverse side?
in, prep. + acc., into, toward, against
Which side should the "prep. + acc." phrase be, with the Latin or English?
enim, postpositive conj., for, in fact, truly
Same question again but this time for the "postpositive conj."
Any other hints for flashcard usage?
Many thanks,
Tony

![ Michael Wimmer works on a piece titled “Birds of a Letter” in his Rossville studio in preparation for this year’s 4 Bridges Art Festival.
Staff photo by Dan Henry/Chattanooga Times Free Press]()
Wooden floors creak, the sound filling the air in a warehouse packed with discarded antiques. The hundreds of items stacked atop one another seem to be organized in a way that only one man could understand.
Working at a table in the middle of this arranged chaos is R. Michael Wimmer, a contemporary artist who has been creating with “cultural fragments” for the past 18 years.
Wimmer, a 52-year-old resident of Rossville, coined the term “cultural fragments” to describe the weathered antiques that he marries together to form his collage sculptures.
“I like it old. If it’s metal, I like it rusty … that gives character to my work, [using] things that have a past to it,” Wimmer said.
Originally an antiques dealer in Florida, Wimmer began his art career in the 1990s when he felt like the antiques market was drying up.
“I always wanted to be an artist and was ready for a change,” Wimmer said.
Wimmer has shown his work up and down the East Coast, and eight years ago he made his first appearance at the local 4 Bridges Art Festival. After that initial visit, he was hooked on Chattanooga and quickly relocated.
Since his debut at 4 Bridges, he has not missed a year and, in 2007, he was given the honor of being the poster artist for the festival.
Wimmer’s sculptures are unique, and they range from wall pieces to public art, including a 14-foot-tall commissioned sculpture at Jefferson Heights Park.
Although he creates diverse artwork, he is best known for his clocks. With some art, he explained, the owner may tire of looking at it after its newness wears off. But people always want to know what time it is, thus guaranteeing that his clock sculptures will be looked at often.
“They’re sculptural and functional, but sculptural first,” he

Are kale salads good? What do they taste like? I only ever bake kale in the oven for "chips."
When I saw this recipe in Southern Living, I thought it was the perfect one to try out.
I used green apples instead of pink lady. I also got this amazing block of Gouda from Trader Joes that had hints of butterscotch and caramel in it.
While kale certainly is tougher than a regular lettuce, the lemon juice it marinates in overnight softens it up, and well of course the cheese helps.
Overall, this is a good salad, but I don't know if I could do it everyday. ;)
Marinated Kale Salad with Apples and Gouda (recipe from Southern Living)
1 Granny Smith Apple
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 bag or 2 bunches Lacinato kale, stemmed and chopped (about 8 oz.)
1/4 cup shaved aged Gouda cheese of choice
1. Chop apple into medium, bite sized pieces.
2. Whisk together lemon juice and next 4 ingredients in a large bowl. Add kale and apples; toss to coat. Cover and chill 2 to 24 hours. Add Gouda cheese, and toss just before serving.
This looks amazing michelle!!
I've never even tried kale but it seems to be very popular in recipes lately! Is it just a tough lettuce or does it have any sort of special flavoring? I think to try it soon...
Love your picture, michelle!
<3 jenn
Jenn it has been so popular lately. I've definitely noticed a Kale trend. It has little bit of a stronger flavor than lettuce but not as prominent as lets say spinach. Def try the chips to start! SO GOOD
Kale is also much more nutritionally dense than most lettuce. It is packed with good-for-you nutrients.
Great looking salad! I've never thought to include apple and gouda before!
I adore kale these days! I buy the ready to eat bags from Trader Joe's and have been caught, more than once, with my hand in the bag & eating it plain. Yum! Plus, my thinking is that no one gets fat from eating too many leafy greens. :) Thanks for this yummy recipe
What a lovely combo- you can't go wrong with some Gouda on top!

NEW YORK (AP) -- The market struggled for direction Friday, signaling what could be a mundane end to an electrifying week.
The Dow Jones industrial average and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose in the first half-hour of trading, then wavered between small gains and losses. Around mid-day, the Dow was basically flat at 13,253 and the S&P 500 was up 2 at 1,404. The Nasdaq composite index was down for most of the morning, then inched up 2 points to 3,058.
Bank of America led the Dow higher with a gain of almost 4 percent, helped by a report that its proportion of delinquent loans fell in February.
Energy companies were the biggest gainers in the S&P 500 index. Transocean, an offshore drilling company, rose 4.5 percent. Analysts from at least three firms raised their price targets on the company, encouraged by its reports of new contracts. Appliance maker Whirlpool fell almost 3 percent, the most in the S&P.
Investors were weighing competing data about the U.S. economy, which likely contributed to the market's vacillations.
The University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index came in lower than the previous month and below analysts' expectations, driven by worries about gas prices.
The Labor Department also noted that gas prices soared 6 percent in February.
Gas is currently selling for an average of $3.83 per gallon in the U.S., 31 cents more than a month ago. It has spiked as Iran's continued nuclear program sows tension in the Middle East. Some analysts also blame the Federal Reserve, which has pumped cheap money into the economy in an attempt to help it recover. But that has also put pressure on the U.S. dollar. When the dollar falls in value, it takes more of them to buy the same amount of oil.
However, the yield on the 10-year Treasury continued to rise. That's a sign that investors are more comfortable with the economy, because it indicates they're more willing to take money out of the government bonds and into riskier investments like the stock market.
Excluding gas prices, data from the Labor Department's consumer price index provided some hopeful signs. Food prices, which have been rising and crimping household budgets, were unchanged for the first time in 19 months.
Earlier this week, the market took off, with both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 crossing milestones they hadn't reached for years. On Tuesday, the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 all recorded their biggest percentage gains of the year. As of Thursday, the Dow had climbed for seven straight days, its longest streak so far this year.
The euphoria was fueled by what investors saw as encouraging news about the unemployment rate and retail sales. But others cautioned that the improvements were incremental and unconvincing, driving short-term market surges but little else.
"It's becoming so much of a sound bite economy," said Ziad Abdelnour, CEO of private equity firm Blackhawk Partners. on Friday, fell 1 percent in early trading and then rose a fraction around mid-day. It's up nearly 45 percent for the year.
Markets in Europe gained. Spain.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- David Villa scored twice to raise his season total to 10 goals and Alexis Sanchez got his second and third goals of the season to lead defending champion Barcelona over Cordoba 5-0 Thursday night.
Thiago Alcantara put Barcelona ahead in the 17th minutes and Villa, who missed the second half of last season after breaking a leg, added goals in the 21st and 26th.
Sanchez scored in the 56th and 86th minutes. Villa came off late because of a cramp in his right leg.
Atletico Madrid tied Getafe 0-0 and advanced 3-0 to a quarterfinal against Betis, which beat Las Palmas 1-0 on Ruben Castro's 85th-minute goal for a 2-1 aggregate win. The other quarterfinals are Real Madrid-Valencia and Zaragoza-Sevilla.

(Updated)"Good Morning America" to Preview "Beedle the Bard"J.K. Rowling
The “Good Morning America” news program will feature a special preview and discussion of “The Tales of Beedle the Bard” on Monday morning, November 26. As we first told you earlier this week, the handwritten book by Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling will be on display here in New York at Sotheby’s auction house starting Monday November 26 as well. The manuscript will later be on display in London, England starting December 7 before it goes up for the charity auction on December 13. The GMA talk show that will preview this book is broadcast on the ABC television network, starting at 7am on Monday. If anyone can capture video, please send it in! UPDATE: As promised, the morning show did preview the book, with the news anchor reading a short excerpt from the “Tales of Beedle the Bard.” These few sentences involved a bit where three brothers create a bridge, and it ended as they meet a mysterious hooded figure. We hope to have video of this, and will update with more when we can.
On a related note, earlier it was reported that estimates on the final sale price of the “Beedle the Bard” book will reach a “record 50,000 pounds ($103,000).” Now, naturally the bookies in the UK have weighed in, claiming this amount is too low for this rare handwritten manuscript. The Economist reports today that one bookmaker “quotes a sale price of £26,000 to £50,000 at 50-1 against—long odds indeed. They indicate the way they are thinking the sale will go by quoting 10-1 against a price of £226,000 to £250,000. Favourite at the moment, priced at 7-2, is a selling price of more than £500,000.”
A reminder that all proceeds from the sale of a preview catalog (available via this link) and the auction of this special “Tales of Beedle the Bard” book will benefit The Children’s Voice charity. You can also read a detailed report from Sotheby’s and JKR, here as well as Melissa’s exclusive preview of the book, here.

Vacation BlegMonday, February 28th, 2011
I’ve been meaning to take a real vacation for a couple years, and just haven’t gotten around to planning one. But I’m set now on taking one the first couple weeks in May. I’m also set on the general area — Central/Eastern Europe. I know I want to spend some time in Prague and Budapest, and then I’m thinking I may wind down the Dalmatian Coast, then possibly fly to Bucharest for a few days before flying back home.
Prague and Budapest are the only definite destinations in all of that. Not sure yet how doable the rest is. But if any Agitatortots familiar with that part of the world have advice, recommendations, ideas, suggestions, please feel free to send them my way. I don’t speak the language in any of those countries, so I can’t get too far off the beaten path. But in the past, many of your not-in-the-guidebooks reader suggestions have been pretty great.
Slovenia might be good for a libertarian: small country that broke away from Yugoslavia and has prospered as an independent country within Europe. My room-mate used to go regularly.
I have always heard great things about Dubrovnik, which was remarkably preserved until the Serbs decided to shell it in 1991. I keep meaning to go, but….
If you’re going to Eastern Europe, you have to get to Tallinn. Estonia has alot of great history and cultural artifacts, of course, but the women there are amazing. You’re a single man, Radley. Go for the gold.
Prague is a beautiful city for walking around. Lots of old buildings to see. (Prague is one of the few cities that was not fought over in the 20th century.)
The best restaurants are in cellars, for some reason, but don’t go into the ones on Wenceslas Square – walking a block away will save you a bundle.
Czech is very difficult. Other than, ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ and ‘how much is it?’, don’t try to learn the language.
On the weekends, Prague is overrun with German weekend trippers. Visit during the week if you can.
Slovenia is my favorite foreign country. Linoge, at just went there. I will recommend that wherever you go, get the latest copy of Lonely Planet for that country. They get run down a lot for catering to hipsters, but they are the only people who assume that you are traveling self-guided, and have enough sense to figure things out by yourself.
Dubrovnik is the coolest place you’ve never been to. If you get close and don’t go, you’re a fool. I was there after the Serbs shelled the place and you’d never know it happened.
Don’t worry about the language. enough people speak english that you’ll do fine. Smile a lot and remember that to say hello, it’s “dober dan”. The pronounciation is different with each language, but no one will care that you’re not exactly correct. They’ll just be happy you tried.
Bucharest is nice, but given the choice I would just spend more time in Dalmatia. It’s a beautiful, interesting and (relatively) cheap place. And going at the beginning of May is all to the better, as the weather will be relatively nice, but you will still encounter relatively few tourists.
Tip: If you’re coming from Budapest, make your way down to Split (an entire city built into a Diocletian palace), and from there go island hopping all the way down to Dubrovnik (stopping at islands like Hvar and Korcula, among others). If you have time, dip down into Montenegro take a day trip to Cetenje and Kotor.
I’m originally from Bratislava, Slovakia, so I’m always disappointed that people always plan to visit the big guys, Prague and Budapest, but skip Bratislava. My city is not a place where you need a full day, but still…
Anyway, I always recommend people to take the train from Prague to Vienna and board a ship down the Danube, at least to Budapest. At least you pass Bratislava along the way, and it’s a nice, relaxing trip. May should be perfect for something like that, weather-wise.
Budapest is delightful. You won’t be able to make heads or tails of the language. It’s pretty cheap to visit there.
I gather you’re more of a fan of bourbon, but Hungary has terrific wine that seldom gets exported to the states; I went to a wine festival back in ’06 and had a great time. Try and find a bottle of Tokaji (excellent desert wine) while you’re there; 5 Puttonyos should cost you fifteen or twenty bucks or less; in the states it’s upwards of fifty. And delicious.
No location advice, but get the Google translate app. It’s free and does pretty much every European language. Almost like having the Star Trek universal translator on your phone.
Dalmatian coast is a good idea. Hvar is not as nice as Korcula (more expensive, too many parties.) Dubrovnik is full of tourists, but still well worth it. If you really want to chill out, try a smaller village – for example Supetar on the island of Brac, a short boat ride out of Split – where there is nothing to do but eat, sleep, and swim in the adriatic. Sveti Stefan should also make the list.
Take a side trip up to Mostar in Bosnia & Herzegovina. Go further to Sarajevo if you’re feeling adventurous. [My wife is actually from ex-YU so I always have a local guide. She, however, recommends Rick Steve's book for the those without a native guide.] Whatever you do, when in BiH be sure to have some Cevapi.
Note that you can fly in to Split and easily get on ferries, or you can fly/train to Zagreb, which is a nice city for 2/3 of a day: arrive in the morning, tour around, and they exit on the night train to Split and get on the ferries from there. Don’t spend the night in Zagreb – too expensive. Better to spend the night on the train. (Get a bunk.)
Finally, if you’re going to be in Prague you should know that the region between Prague and Dresden is very interesting (as are both cities). There’s a lot of casual “hiking” to be done along the Czech-German border just outside Dresden where the Elbe river flows through some interesting sandstone formations. For example, there are nice walks out of the villages of Hohnstein and Stadt Wehlen.
*pictures a beach packed with cute spotted puppies*
I highly recommend Istria in Croatia – very Italian in feel because it’s a stone’s throw from Trieste – but also very economical. I had a great time in Rovinj.
As an expat who’s been living in Prague for 15 years, I’d have to say it all depends on what you are looking for. The architecture in the center is really something to see, and still amazes me to this day, but can also be quite touristy. Ideally you’d probably want to maximize seeing the cool stuff with staying off the beaten path.
When we go on vacation I’m more of the mind to spend the time in one place, get to know it, than to try and maximize places visited.
I highly recommend Bratislava on the grounds that I once got a pork filet stuffed with bacon there. The name of the restaurant, sadly, eludes me, but it was a dish worth hunting for.
Also a great meal there costs the equivalent of about 90 cents.
Budapest is my favorite city to visit. I thought Prague was overrun with Western European tourists and was just ok. Former Yugoslavia is wonderful and I agree with everything Paul #9 said. I’ve heard that Bucharest is a bit too much “former Communist country” and not enough “charming former Communist country”. Sofia is supposed to be wonderful.
Have a great time and know that, where ever you end up, you can do no wrong!
This is about 1.5 hours outside of Prague and probably worth seeing:
Spent the mid-80′s in the US Army in then-West Germany. The best beer, by far, was the Czech Budweiser Budvar. The brewery is in the Czech town of Budweis (get it?), and they offer a guided tour every day at 2.
If you like bacon/heavy food + best beer in the world then Slovakia/Czech republic is hard to beat, especially if you veer just slightly off the track, just walking distance of it is enough. Bulgaria by train is also quite cool in the sense in that the countryside still looks quite Warsaw pact era, had a blast doing that.
And I wouldn’t worry too much about getting off the beaten track, most people are kind and only happy to help. Plus much more fun, and not like you are likely to get raped or killed, just scammed which isn’t too bad*.
As for Budapest do try the lovely proper salamis, goulash and a nice Tokay to finish it off.
Also, just a thought but aren’t there some libertarian student associations there who’d be willing to trade an inspiring lecture for food/beer/sightseeing/night on the town with the locals?
* Dodgy taxis around the airport being the most hard to avoid. Also helps being a man/shaved/not too small/aware of your basic scams and dodgy people.
Budapest is nice. Driving is a little crazy. Tokaji wine is awesome. Lots of good looking women but it might be a little cold this time of year to really notice. They like to dance. Be careful with Palinka (fruit brandy), its like their version of Tequila. Their language is nuts, beyond a few basics, you just don’t have enough time to learn.
Croatia is amazing. They have better Italian food than the Italians. Very friendly. I recommend taking a couple days to explore Dubrovnik. If you want to do some incredible diving check out dcpongo.com. The dive center is run by some really great guys.
I agree with the staying in one place for a while (like a week) as opposed to cramming as many sights into a trip as possible. What I’ve noticed about Eastern Europeans in general (Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, etc.) is that they are almost always really friendly and love to party (and really love alcohol, like they really really really love the stuff). And the girls are usually much friendlier and less inhibited than most American girls.
Cesky Krumlov. It’s a small, excruciatingly beautiful town a few hours south of Prague. Decent tourist infrastructure. So pretty you won’t believe it. Budvar is on the way. Don’t bother learning Czech – its basically impossible. You can hire a local guide for not too much. The Sedlec ossuary mentioned above is really cool, though the town’s not that great itself, as I recall. If you can, go to the opera in Prague. It’s cheap and super historic (I saw Don Giovanni in the theater where it premiered, the gorgeous Estates Theater!)
Vienna – brats and beer, but different from the German version. There is an area called The Bermuda Triangle that is full of bars and cafes.
Budapest – awesome city. If you want pictures, go up Gellert Hill for the sunset. Great views of the river and bridges. There is a fort up there with an outside bar. They have these hidden bars called kerts that are in the courtyards of old abandoned Soviet-era apartment buildings. Ask the locals where they are. We were told to look for the building behind the yellow church. And we found it.
Prague – like others mentioned, good if you get away from the tourists
Bratislava – very small. When I went it (2006) was full of British stag parties.
Croatia (from advice I got from an acquaintance before going – this is him speaking) -I have spent most of my time in Croatia on the islands. they are a bit more rugged, untamed, relaxed, less crowded, and better swimming. Almost all the beaches are rocky but there are loads of secluded coves and uninhabited islands that are very tranquil. However if you are looking for nightlife the mainland would probably be the place to go. The obvious exception is Hvar, which is relatively busy at nghts in Hvar city, but it is a bit touristy, expensive, and the beaches on Hvar are not great. My time in Hvar was excellent, was with a good group of people and had loads of wine and fresh fish and out until two in the morning every day. However it was also at the time I was working in Kosovo making a lot of money and was willing to pay anything to finally relax and enjoy a bit of nightlife. It is not the best place to maintain a budget.
On Brac there is the only sandy beach called Bol. I have not been there but hear it is very nice with a nice old town. A lot of people from Split go there which is a good sign, if the locals bother to travel there then there must be something worth visiting.
Korcula is my island and is probably the best balance of being a backwater and yet having an infrastructure. However it is pretty sleepy, I have been out in Korcula city and Vela Luka many times and never really had a great night out. It is more of a place to turn the volume down and chill on a beach and walk through the vineyards. If you are looking for a party, it will be tough to find. However the landscape is very beautiful and there are plenty of old villages and scenic swimming coves. If you are looking to relax, Korcula might be the best choice.
Vis is a very scenic island with a nice little main town on it that I enjoy maybe more than Hvar. It is much less crowded so it depends on luck a bit as to who is on the island at the time. I think it has the highest potential for fun but if it is empty. . . it will be a bit sleepy. However it has good swimming, good food, and is a bit cheaper than Hvar.
I have not been to the other islands so I do not have any comment different than what the guidebooks would say.
The Mainland
The mainland is CROWDED, beaches are packed from end to end with people, you have trouble finding a place to put your towel (particuarly Makarska). It depends what you are looking for, crowds mean a lively night scene, Makarska is noisy and full of parties. Anywhere in the “Makarska Riveria” will be geared toward tourists and be much more lively, and probably relatively expensive. I have not spent much time there so I cannot comment more, only that my friends that go to Makarska are younger and looking to pick up German tourists. I am too old for that so I head for the islands.
Split is worth a night however. The bars around the Palace have a pretty good atmosphere and there is a good amount of people and nightlife. It is not too touristy, not euro nightclubs, just bars where the crowd spills outside. It is a cool old town and not too expensive.
Dubrovnik is beautiful as advertised. The nightlife there is pretty good because there are so many tourists but the food is no good, it is VERY expensive, and there are no beaches (though you can go to islands nearby for the day, Locrum I believe). When I have visitors I plan to go to Dubrovnik, wake up early, walk around the walls before it gets too hot, spend the afternoon in the city and have a decent dinner at a restaurant underneath the fort, just outside of the walled city (unfortunately I cannot remember its name). One day is usually enough for me.
If you have the opportunity, check out Montenegro. It is not that far from Dubrovnik and their coast is beautiful as well, in a different way. Go through the bay of Kotor and stay a night or two in Budva, both places are at most three hours from Dubrovnik. Kotor is stunningly beautiful and Budva has sandy beaches and a very lively nightlife and prices in Montenegro are lower than Croatia. I like Croatia better, it is more varried and there is more to explore, but Montenegro really offers a lot for a small place.
If you’re driving at all, the Plitvice Lakes are on the way from Zagreb to the coast. Brilliant!
I went to Hungary and the Czech Republic a few years ago. Some points:
–Amazing hiking in the Sumava. It was part of the Iron Curtain and is now national parks, so it never featured modern development.
–Beautiful towns in southern Bohemia.
–Beer is cheaper than water. Soda, on the other hand, is very expensive (2.5 euros for what would cost you 1.5 dollars). However, it’s made with sugar instead of corn syrup, which really makes a huge difference.
–Budapest was largely destroyed in WWII, Prague was not. Prague’s castle has some really amazing historical sites.
–Both cities, as well as Bratislava, have great public transit systems. However, ticket systems work like commuter rail/amtrak–you don’t have to show a ticket to get on, but if you’re caught without one by a roving inspector you will be hit with a very expensive fine.
In Budapest, you must go here: After the fall of communism, the Hungarians took all the huge ugly soviet-era statues and put them in this old industrial park as sort of a memorial/f*ck you to the communist government. It’s hard to get to, but totally worth it, and one of the best/subtlest statements of human freedom I have ever seen. Best to go on a grey cloudy day.
Also, if you like wine, Egri Bikaver (hungarian wine from Eger) can be amazing or awful.
Also, the intercity train system is great. You can buy a ticket between two cities, get off at an intermediate point, then get back on with the same ticket a week later.
There are ex-pats living in Central Europe. Anarchist Mike Gogulski is one, in Slovakia. You might look him up, he’s pretty well established there now.
FYI Gene Healy used to live in Prague.
If you’re staying more than 2 nights in a row in Budapest or Prague, get an apartment rather than a hotel. There are lots of good apartment search websites, and you can get a comfortable place right in the middle of things for much less than an equally comfortable hotel room in the same neighborhood.
In Prague stay in Stare Mesto or the Jewish quarter, and do not miss the synagogue/cemetery tour in the latter. Also don’t miss the Obecni dum, an extraordinary example of Art Nouveau architecture. Once you’re done with the central stuff, Vysehrad is lovely and less touristed than some of the other big-draw sites. It’s worth budgeting quite a bit of time to just walk the streets with no particular destination in mind: the streetscape is a large part of the draw and the city is compact. Do go to the opera and/or a classical concert but don’t expect the quality of the music to be that great; the pleasure is in hearing music in a hallowed space.
In Budapest stay on the Pest side near the river, in or on the “Kis Korut”. I second the Szoborpark recommendation. Another out-of-the-way freedom memorial place worth visiting is the cemetery where Imre Nagy is buried.
At Czech restaurants order the game: the wild boar or the rabbit or the venison. They do game really well, wild boar in particular. Beer is fantastic there, as you know. The local red wine is crap but they do a very nice white called Veltlinske zelene (the Czech equivalent of the Austrian varietal Gruner Veltliner). Also, be sure to have some medovnik for dessert where it’s available: it is the best honey cake you’ll ever taste.
In Hungary go to the pastry cafes and eat lots of strudel. They do strudel better than anybody else, including the Austrians who invented it. Try the poppyseed (“makos retes”) in particular. For real, cheap, down-to-earth Hungarian food go to Szent Jupat on the Buda side. When you are tired of heavy Central Euro cuisine go to Govinda on Vigyazo Ferenc utca for their quirky vegetarian buffet.
Tokaji aszu is a lovely dessert wine but very sweet; for the full effect get the 6 puttonyos or, if you want to splurge, the Eszencia. Tokaji szamorodni is a nice reliable drier white. Hungarian reds can be good but are hit-or-miss– the best ones, and a lot of good whites too, are from a town called Etyek and will usually say “Etyek” or “Etyeki” in their names. I have never had a really good Egri bikaver.
jb: I’ve consumed my fair share of cheap, cheap Egri Bikavér. One of my favorite memories of Budapest involves buying two bottles for 500 Forint (2.50 USD) and sitting with a girlfriend in the foundations of a long-destroyed church. Also, an important life lesson from that evening: if you don’t have a corkscrew, you can push the cork into the bottle.
Echo all the comments about Slovenia. Do the capital, Ljubljana. Then go to Bled, which is absolutely picturesque. There’s a chapel in the middle of Lake Bled. Short boat ride and you’re there. Magical.
Budapest is fantastic. One must-do: Gerbeaud. My favorite dessert place in the world, great view of the river to boot:
Have fun!
I was in Kotor and Dubrovnik in 2008. Both are beautiful and well worth the visit. In Dubrovnik be sure to check out the two “Buza” bars, which are at the top of the cliff overlooking the sea through a hole along the top of the wall. We were having beers in one enjoying the atmosphere and the amazing view when two of the Playmates from “Girls Next Door” came in with a film crew to shoot footage for the show. Marginally ok eye candy but girls who would wear impossible high heels in that rocky place don’t rate too high on the IQ scale! I thought the guys diving off the cliffs ala Acapulco were more interesting.
In Kotor make the trip up the 1400 steps to the old fort, then walk the Roman-era switchbacks on the way down. Amazingly beautiful area in a rustic Yugoslavian way with cheap food, drinks and friendly people. Most everyone speaks English – I learned a little Croatian and almost never used it.
I was in Prague and Budapest in 2000 and both were cheap back then. Prague was beautiful and well-preserved as the Czechs just rolled over in WWII. Budapest had a very cool Communist chic meets western capitalism vibe in 2K that’s probably gone by now, but try the smaller cities like Gyor that are off the beaten track. Beautiful and friendly country but forget Hungarian unless you can speak Finnish. A little German may help here.
Dream trip now would be Turkey through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits to the Black Sea. I’m dying to check out Romania and Bulgaria. It sounds like a great plan for a trip – enjoy!
In Prague itself during May:, the high point of which is the performance of the Symphony of a Thousand on the 100th anniversary of Mahler’s death (May 18), and for which it sounds like they are actually going to have a thousand performers onstage, what with two orchestras, three adult choruses and two boy’s choirs involved; although I suspect what’s left of the tickets will be long gone if you wait until you get to Prague to buy them. The other concerts, less so.
One of my MDs is from Romania. He once told me there is nothing worth seeing there. And just including Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary and the various states of ex-Yugoslavia, you probably have more than enough for a trip of two or three weeks.
I was born and raised in Budapest so I’m biased. :) Budapest, Eger and Pecs are beautiful. Gyor and Bratislava are good for that Detroit 1972 vibe. Miskolc, Salgotarjan and Ozd are excellent places to get stabbed by roving drunks at 2 AM while staring at ruined post-industrial, countryside hell. Further north, Trencin Slovakia makes for a pretty daytrip.
I love me some Budapest, and Eger is fun. Prague is beautiful, but I’ve always had a more lively time in Budapest for some reason.
The Dalmatian coast is lovely, and Slovenian wine is excellent. Do not miss Dubrovnik–photographer’s wet dream. I’ve not yet been to Romania or Bulgaria, but Bulgaria has good food (there used to be a Bulgarian/European restaurant on 23rd street in Crystal City when you were here, dunno if you ever went).
Lonely Planet guides are musts. Let’s Go is awful, and full of lies (near as I can tell, many authors don’t visit the places but crib stuff from a local tour guide in a rush before the deadline).
Sadly, most of my contacts are in Poland, and my Budapest contacts have left. Then again, you know Matt Welsh, so he can probably hook you up in that area.
Ping me if you want some specifics, but sadly it’s been 10 years since I’ve been there.
Prague: Bukowski’s Bar. Pretty cool little spot. Eat at Radost, right off the IP Pavlova tram/metro stop. Being a libertarian, you may want to check out the Museum of Communism, a great place to spend a few hours. Finally, not sure when you’re planning on going, but try to check out a Sparta Praha soccer or hockey game. Schedules online, cheap tickets at the gate, they basically give away delicious beer, and also I believe they play sports during the entire thing.
Shoot me an email with questions.
Lots of good tips have me wanting to go! When I left the Army (stationed in Germany) in 1989, the Wall was still a couple of months from coming down. I always wanted to go to Prague and Budapest, but couldn’t.
East Berlin wasn’t nearly the same. :/
My best advice? Catch some episodes of “Three Sheets”, starring Zane Lamprey.
s2e1: Croata
s2e3: Czech Republic
s4e13: Lesbos (Yeah, it’s a bit far off your track, but wouldn’t you love to write up a travelogue about your wild night with a bunch of Lesbians?)
I’m looking forward to lots of your great photos, video interviews with local liberty movement folks, and future columns. You know — all that stuff that makes the trip tax deductible!
Here’s Rhys’ blog about his trip to Prague:
Innsbruck, Austria…there’s a free hiking club for local hotel guests that will take you on (not too strenuous) hikes with some fantastic Tyrolean views. Stay in Muhlau at the Hotel Koreth, a 20 minute walk from downtown. Say hi to Frau Kuhn, the owner, for me!
Croatia is beautiful but very touristy. There are tons of Western European tourists to annoy you. I recommend Bosnia which is not only a small piece of the orient but incredibly beautiful, overlooked and cheap. Same goes for Macedonia. Kosovo is also fun and as an American you’ll be very very welcome.
If you do decide to go to Croatia, head to Split for the day to see Diocletian’s palace and then take a ferry out to one of the island (the furtehr out the better) for beautiful coast, good food and better wine.
Prague is also too touristy. It’s good for 2 days tops.
Most commenters have focused on the transition countries. Let me put in a pitch for Germany and Denmark. In particular, in Germany, you might check out Bonn, which has a lot of uncrowded, high quality museums due to its status as the former capitol of West Germany, and Copenhagen, which is lots of fun. Plus (approximately) everyone in Denmark speaks English well. If you like rough scenery, go up to Skagen at the northern tip of Denmark, and stop by Aarhus on the way.
As a beergeek I’ll suggest you check out U Fleku in Prague
It’s the Czech version of a German beerhall, a bit touristy, but the black lager they make is unlike anything you have had. It’s rich like dark bread and I still try to perfect my homebrew version of this style beer. A great place to spend a Spring afternoon.
Responding to Jeff’s suggestion, if you go to Copenhagen, visit Freetown Christiania, an anarchist enclave in the middle of the city. (Hash was openly sold on the streets there until 2004. Take that, drug warriors!)
I second the U Fleku recommendation. Also, Hungarian food is awesome.
If you go to Vienna, do not miss the Military History Museum (Heeresgeschichtliches Museum). It has, among a vast array of interesting things (a medieval manual of arms, the car in which Archduke Ferdinand was killed), the most chilling exhibit I’ve ever seen on the street fighting leading up to the Anschluss.
Prague is a beautiful city. As a tourist, I didn’t mind the other tourists. Be sure to plan lots of time wandering the streets at night. There are really good groups of musicians all over the place. As music lover, you’ll love it (a reason to consider Vienna as well – a short train trip away).
Budapest is a wonderful city to visit. 1) The other guys are right about the local wines. They’re great. 2) Visit the touristy stuff at least once. There are great photo ops all around, and a neat cave system under the city that you can explore. 3) Visit the Baths. 4) I can’t remember the actual name of it (someone may have mentioned it already) but there is a ‘theme park” outside of the city where they put all the old soviet era statues and such. They actually charge money for you to go in and see the old commie propaganda. It’s beautiful. So is the “south park” shirt I got with the kids all done up as Mau, Lenin, Marx, and someone else I can’t remember.
Yup. Just read through some more of the comments….JB already mentioned the statue park thing.
I spent a week in Belgrade at the start of the year for a recent job. I couldn’t tell you much about the city, as the majority of my time was spent in a studio working with some animators. But I can say that the people were super nice, the food was excellent, and what little I did see (pretty much just the walk between my hotel and the studio) seemed really nice. I wouldn’t hesitate to go again and check it out.
As Sean mentioned, I thoroughly loved the week I spent in Slovenia… Being able to drive across the country in about three hours, spanning geography from port towns to alpine mountains to vinery hills to farmland and everything inbetween was amazing, the people were awesome, and the costs were not really all that bad (as long as you did not pay too close attention at the gas pump). And the gorges and waterfalls in that country are not to be believed…
+1 on Bratislava, but the deal with it is they (random thieves) may want your car unless it’s a Lada. Food is all strangely gray like the Soviet-inspired architecture, yet surprisingly delicious (unlike the Soviet anything). People (ok, the women, yeah, I was single when i was there) are beautiful and friendly. It’s considered the red-headed stepchild of the more prosperous Czech Republic, but overall a neat experience. When I first went (by car, with Austrians, in the 90′s), the border guards obviously hadn’t seen many USA passports and one by one came and looked in the window to get a peek at me. Interesting.
Go to Vienna. I know it’s a “been there done that” kind of city for lots, but it’s just got lots of character. Good beer a SiebenSternBrau. Plus there’s the Wiener Riesenrad (big ferris wheel in a Six-Flags-esque park where they play weird french hip-hop and serve beer).
In Prague, have a beer in a place serving beer since the 1400s (well 1500), but still pretty old. And old clock in the town square is cool too.
U Fleku.
I’m going to make an argument for Bucharest. In my opinion it is the second best city in Europe (after Berlin). It could possibly be because of my personal background and interests, but Bucharest is simply fascinating. It isn’t the most beautiful city by conventional standards (though it has some stunning buildings like the Creţulescu Palace and Romanian Athenaeum), but the interplay between pre-war and Ceaușescu eras make for some very, very interesting walks. Likewise the sheer scale of the communist planning is something to behold (see, for example the Piața Victoriei or, most famousy, the Palace of the Parliament).
In general, though I’m a huge fan of Eastern Europe and you can’t really go wrong there.
The Dalmation coast is simply stunning and Dubrovnik is not to be missed. But it must be noted that the central, walled city, while beautiful, is one of the worst tourist ghettos around. Totally worth seeing, but incredibly busy. I found the old walled city in Kotor, Montenegro almost as nice and not as busy. As others have said a trip to Mostar, in BiH, is recommended as is Sarajevo which has a great nightlife if you’re into that kind of thing.
I will also agree with the people recommending Bratislava. It’s a great little city that you should visit, especially if you’re going to be in Budapest, which I found only moderately interesting.
Personally, I would leave Prague for a different trip, or connect it with other places in Central Europe (Germany, Poland) and focus on the Balkans/Eastern Europe exclusively.
And ignore those recommending Scandinavia. While there are a number of good things about places like Copenhagen, they are dreadfully bland and remarkably boring for the tourist.
If you can’t get laid in Prague, you should kill yourself.
I have kicked around quite a bit of Eastern Europe.
Budapest was amazing. I agree with staying on the Pest side of the river. Make sure you visit the Cave Monastery, pretty amazing place.
Bucharest was nice, but I must admit that I had a much better time in Budapest. If you make to Bucharest, there is an amazing tourist area that is original village houses and buildings brought from all over Romania and placed together to make replica villages.
Sofia was the same as Bucharest. Great place, but still not as beautiful as Budapest.
If you get a chance, L’vov in Ukraine has some beautiful building and is a great place to relax. Kiev is another place I highly recommend. I lived there for a while between contracts in Iraq. If you make it to Kiev, make sure to try the borsht and visit the WWII museum. Also, the most beautiful women in the world can be found walking down Kreshatik Street in Kiev.
I’ve spent a lot of time as a solo traveler in many of the places you mentioned.
First, skip Bucharest. Truly a depressing city — your heart will be smashed to smithereens by the packs of stray dogs roaming the city. The only nice thing I have to say about Bucharest is that it made me truly understand the horrors of totalitarianism; the city is like a crumbling museum about the old regime, with huge blocs of identical apartment buildings and pathetic monuments to greatness. (The mock arc d’triumph is so depressing…)
However, your other ideas are great and I second all the positive comments about Budapest, Prague, and Croatia. If you go to Budapest, make sure to visit the baths — I can’t think of the name of the big one, but it’s worth a visit as you can’t find anything remotely analogous in the US. The islands off the Dalmation coast are phenomenal, Dubrovnik is ridiculously beautiful (though it gets a little dull after a day or two), and Istria is springtime is amazing.
Vienna’s boring, though the architecture is remarkable. And there are the most remarkable statues of war heroes, which makes sense. I actually think of Vienna, Budapest, and Bucharest as a spectrum — I found Vienna too western-ized and well put together, Bucharest too Soviet-bloc and depressing, and I thought Budapest was the perfect balance.
Finally, I’ve never made it to Kosovo or Bosnia, but I’ve heard from a number of friends that they’re phenomenal places to visit. You can day-trip to Bosnia (Mostar?) from Dubrovnik. I think there must be something about cities and small countries that are recently recovering from war and calamity that translates to an insistence on enjoying life.
Hope this helps.
I’m coming late to your post, but I wanted to let you know that I went to Budapest last March with my girlfriend (as part of a two-week Budapest-Vienna-Salzburg-Munich-Berlin-Warsaw odyssey), and it was literally the best time of my life. Budapest was such an incredible city to explore, and in the spring parts of it can seem almost deserted (but I mean this in a good way).
I don’t know if you already have a hotel booked, but if not, I highly recommend Le Meridien. It’s right on one of the main squares, and if you book it through the right source (read: Kayak), you can get a really incredible deal on what is truly a five-star hotel.
Make sure to visit the Karpatia restaurant. We found it only by accident, though it turned out later that it is in fact in some of the guidebooks. It was definitely one of the best meals of our lives. Make sure to sit at the cafe in the square by St. Isztvan’s Cathedral and order the Dreher on tap. Dreher’s available everywhere there, and it’s the only beer you’ll ever need to order. And Budapest in general is pretty cheap. A pack of real Camel cigarettes was 250 Forints – roughly $1.26.
Eastern Europe may very well be one of the last real gems of European travel. I would also recommend Berlin, if you get a chance. The only way I can describe it is that they have their shit together – both in the political and cultural sense – and to me it felt like kind of the perfect city.
Also, Warsaw was pretty cool. The Old Town, destroyed during World War II, was completely rebuilt to the original medieval specifications, and it feels hundreds of years old. Communists were shitty designers, but they could certainly build.
[...] all were so helpful with ideas last time, I figure I’ll see if you have any suggestions about a little planning quandary I’ve [...]

It is very disturbing to see so much misinformation in the news regarding the upcoming enhancement millage. Both Alpena Public Schools and the AMA ESD have gone to great lengths to educate the public on facts related to the millage. They've held numerous meeting throughout the community with very little attendance by voters. Only one other person was present at the meeting I attended. This obvious lack of interest by voters is astounding. Rather than get accurate information from the professionals who know the facts, people are content to speculate, second-guess and sabotage. Perhaps that's because the facts won't support their own preconceived opinions.
The reality is that if voters pass the millage, educational opportunities for the children in our community will be better. On the other hand, if the millage proposal is defeated, educational opportunities will continue to decline. My own children all graduated from APS well-prepared for college and the workforce that awaited them. They were fortunate. They had excellent teachers who provided them with a top-notch education. I am grateful that the members of our community supported our schools while my children were attending them. Now it's time to consider the futures of the youngest in our community - those children just starting their educational journey.
I've been an elementary teacher for APS for the past 11 years. I work hard to instill a love of learning in my students, and I regularly tell them that they can be whatever they want to be when they grow up. I encourage them to dream big and set high goals for themselves. I'm concerned that if the millage doesn't pass, my students may not have the educational opportunities to reach their goals and achieve their dreams. I'm supporting the millage because my students deserve a quality education.

What I Heard About the World
WHAT I HEARD ABOUT THE WORLD. Photo courtesy of EdFringe.
BOTTOM LINE: This finely crafted think-piece, as charming as it is sharp, subtlety (and sometimes not so subtlety) wields a worthy, important message.
Facts, facts. What’s in a fact? That which we call a fact by any other name would smell as sweet? Or hold as much water? What I Heard About The World confronts our contemporary fact-flooded condition with humor, grace, and heavy guitar-solos, and plays at St. Stephen’s Church now through August 19th.
Three men, sitting, lying, standing, hold their places on the set prior to the audience arrival, amid enough odds and ends to evoke a cross between a tidy but distinctly man-only dwelling and a bizarre science-y talk-show. Eventually, a cabinet in the back reveals itself to hold fastidiously ordered supplies: canisters of salt, bottles of water, pint glasses, paintball guns; all to have their very specific purpose disclosed through the course of the next hour or so. A fishless fish tank humbly sits furthest downstage, expectantly.
What follows is a highly curated barrage of information, factoids, anecdotes, and true tales, some of which have already become Internet highlights with their own fifteen minutes. Twined together with some acting-out, electric guitar, and clever bits to underscore the absurdity so many of the stories present, the three men quickly assert themselves as likable and trustworthy. And clever, to boot.
Devised and written over the past five years by the three performers, Jorge Andrade, Alexander Kelly, and Chris Thorpe, What I Heard About The World intelligently proclaims a familiar though nonetheless necessary notion: when facts became Google-able and Internet-easy, they also became cheap, flooded, and frivolous. No longer the stuff of importance, facts have become a network of cyber-reality and supposed authenticity, operating all too often as stand-ins for actual experiences. These three men, armed with information aplenty, measuredly manage their strung together little pearls to transforms them to clever provocation.
Culminating in a bloody massacre and subsequently a reminder that access and information can also be powerfully positive, the three men reach far and wide to then gift their message to the audience: these stories, these moments, these facts are nebulous, changeable, and only crushingly definitive of the world when they are allowed to be. What I Heard About The World is a beautifully different piece that has much to offer.
(What I Heard About The Worldplays at St. Stephen's Church, St. Stephen's Street, through August 19, 2012. Performances are daily at 4:35pm (not the 13th). Tickets are £14 (concessions available) and are available at edfringe.com. To contribute your own stories go to whatiheardabouttheworld.co.uk.)

The action of this play takes place in Paris, which is the perfect metaphorical place to set a play about love. To get the flavor of the piece, consider one scene in which a young American in Paris meets a beautiful woman and immediately asks her to marry him or, at least have a cup of coffee with him that might lead to marriage. Being French, she is not immediately impressed by his ardor, but his charm wins over both the girl and the audience. Later in the show, another young woman is waiting at a cafe for the love of her life to appear. Her waiter, a young man we've come to know as a man trapped in a pattern of loneliness, asks her when her lover is expected. She answers, "Either fifteen minutes or five years." Finally understanding that there is no specific man on his way, he takes his chance and breaks his pattern to declare himself as the lover she's been waiting for. Happily, they embrace and kiss. It's a sweet and deeply felt victory for love.
More often, however, Mee's contemplation of romantic love takes us down unexpected alleys, such as when we witness a professor leading a group of students on a comic tour of his love life, showing them where he received his first kiss, the place where he was dumped for the first time, where he had sex with his future wife, and finally where he had his first encounter with a man. There is also an art class where we see a naked man and woman in a series of sensual poses, and a scene where we meet two lesbians in a quarrel about how their love life failed. There is even a mock Project Runway moment where the costumes become more and more outrageous as we see the variety of people strutting their need to be seen, desired, and loved.
Director Kim Weild, the true star of this production, has taken a page out of Baz Luhrman's book of directing to give us a visual hurricane of images. Set designer Brian H. Scott uses the expansive size of the Ohio's Theatre's playing space to create a fluid stage that simply pours forth with a variety of perfectly realized planes in which the action transpires. Those spaces are exceptionally well-lit with color and shadow by lighting designer Charles Foster. And rarely does a cast get so many exotic, amusing, and sexy costumes to wear as those designed by Lisa Renee Jordan.
The large, fully committed cast -- who act, dance, kiss, and pet heterosexually and homosexually -- should be commended for their work; but special mention for their exceptional performances should go to Kyle Knauf, Khris Lewin, and Jessica Green.

Fortunately, its flaws are partially redeemed by its four-person cast: Thomas Sadoski, who has deepened his already probing performance as factory worker Greg, the intensely gifted Marin Ireland, who deserves to be kissed by the producers on the hem of her late-in-play asymmetrical skirt for immersing herself in the role of Greg's aggrieved girlfriend Steph, and Piper Perabo (the show's other holdover) and Steven Pasquale as married co-workers Carly and Kent, who also warrant kudos for their committed performances under Terry Kinney's acidly biting direction.
The reason Steph is loudly warring with boyfriend Greg at the play's outset is because she's had word from Carly that Greg described her as ugly to Kent. As the shouting crescendos on David Gallo's blue-collar-environs set, Greg insists he was expressing his love for Steph, even if she has a "regular" face. Yet, despite his sometimes obscenity-riddled protestations, Steph wants none of it and abruptly quits the four-year relationship.
As time passes, Greg -- who reads Poe and Hawthorne during his breaks from packing frozen food -- has to learn not only to live with Steph's decision, but to tolerate the increasingly boorish behavior of the muscular Kent, another of LaBute's arrested-development boys in a man's buff body. Among other things, Greg is obliged to keep mum to newly-pregnant Carly about Kent's affair with (unseen) co-worker Crystal. The boys come to bloody blows when Greg finally declares he'll no longer provide alibis for Kent, and the damage doesn't stop there.
Ultimately, Greg is forced to examine his own immature behavior and even rectify it -- an act which heretofore has been atypical of LaBute's testosterone-overloaded male characters. But the surprising turn of events may come too late to mollify patrons sated by the playwright's all-too- familiar verbal and physical attacks. (It's to his credit, however, that in the move to Broadway, he's excised the awkward monologues that stopped the earlier version in its careering tracks.)
Moreover, while he tells the audience as much as they need know about Steph, Carly and Kent, he hasn't supplied enough information on Greg. Who is this guy working for years at an assembly-line job while reading what sounds like the syllabus for an Early-American Lit course? Nonetheless, the superb Sadoski, who makes Greg's self-examination painfully palpable right up to his fade-out look, is one of the main reasons that reasons is still worth watching.

Truman -- at whom the brickbat "flip-flop" was never thrown -- made any number of blunt and well-publicized pronouncements during his life, many of them repeated by Barnaba, who bears a passable enough physical and vocal resemblance to the oval office occupant from 1945 to 1952. One of the no-holds-barred comments many ticket-buying citizens may find uncomfortably pertinent goes: "There is nothing worse than a liar in public office, because the people might believe him, and if they catch a fellow like that, they should give him about as much compassion as he gave the Constitution of the United States."
Gallu sets most of Truman's fast-paced reminiscences in the Oval Office, as Barnaba circles his desk or frequently sits at it while welcoming, among unseen others, Herbert Hoover and a bevy of union officials. He carries on phone conversations with generals and secretaries, writes letters (one to a critic who lambasted concertizing daughter Margaret) and tells mildly ribald jokes for every occasion.
Sometimes wandering into the past to recall speeches he made when still a senator or jump-cutting to Independence, Missouri to mow his front lawn, Truman gabs, most often briefly, about his presidency, acknowledging it was "accidental" -- not something he ever sought as a former haberdasher. Most of the time, though, Gallu presents a Truman whom historians corroborate as possessing iron-clad convictions that included immovable belief in decency, plain-speaking, the law, and the Constitution.
Barnaba is a quick-to-laugh Truman, particularly in the first half of this two-act backward glance. Only twice does he get exercised. The first sequence that has Barnaba circling the stage stormily involves General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, who becomes the occasion for a midnight stroll across the front of the stage -- as if the controversial old soldier were present. MacArthur's dismissal after clashing publicly and privately with Truman over Korean War policy was eventual big-type headline news and lends itself to fiery dramatics here. The second extended segment has Barnaba scorching the air as Truman rants against Senator Joseph McCarthy and his assault on the Bill of Rights.
By the time Truman takes a late-show constitutional with cane in hand in deference to one of the Prexy's most famous traditions, Barnaba has offered the man's thoughts about Franklin Roosevelt, Ike Eisenhower, George Marshall, John F. Kennedy and dad Joe, Adlai Stevenson, Richard Nixon (not favorable), the then Lady Astor and inserted a few mentions of first lady Bess, whom more than once he call "the boss."
In what seems Gallu's most conspicuous lapse, Truman deals with the decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in a couple of sentences. Aware of the possibilities that a million civilian lives can be lost, he mentions he has "no options," and that's that for an episode that lends itself to a meaty full-throttle drama.

Most low-income families cook at home at least five times per week and consider healthy meals to be both important and realistic, but a struggle.
I was invited to a press event to announce the results of a survey conducted by Share Our Strength's Cooking Matters program. The program and the survey, "It's Dinnertime: A Report on Low-Income Families' Efforts to Plan, Shop for and Cook Healthy Meals," are sponsored by the ConAgra Foods Foundation.
I went because I was interested in the survey and also because I admire the work of chef Sara Moulton who, among many other things, works with Share Our Strength on this program.
Cooking Matters is part of Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry Campaign. Its goal is to help low-income families increase access to public food resources (food assistance benefits, farmers' market coupons) and produce healthy meals at low cost. It does this through a six-week course that teaches shopping strategies, meal planning, and cooking.
The research produced some important findings, perhaps obvious:
- Eight out of 10 low-income families cook at home at least five times per week, more if they are poorer.
- Eight-five percent of low-income families consider eating healthy meals to be important and realistic.
- Low-income families struggle to put healthy meals on the table: food costs and preparation time are big barriers.
- Low-income families are eager for cooking and budgeting tips and tools.
Where does ConAgra fit in?
ConAgra owns countless food product brands that pack the center aisles of supermarkets. ConAgra Foods Foundation is funded solely by ConAgra Foods. One of the study's conclusions is very much in ConAgra's interest:.
The program works to improve the image of frozen and canned fruits and vegetables among low-income families.
Ordinarily, food industry-sponsored programs make me squirm. This one makes me squirm less than most even though Sara Moulton was cooking with at least one ConAgra product: Wesson Oil.
But the program worked with 18,000 families last year and its goals make sense.
Canned and frozen fruits and vegetables really do retain much of the nutritional value of fresh produce unless they are loaded with salt and sugars. Sara was cooking with low-salt products and the dishes she made were easy, inexpensive, nutritious, and quite delicious.
I'm impressed with how this program teaches families to fend for themselves in today's tough environment.
Now, if ConAgra would just get busy promoting policies to improve access to healthy foods for everyone....

A look at how the city has become a center for tech, design, and innovation
Miami is on a mission to become an international tech hub and a host of entrepreneurs -- from rookie startup founders to established CEOs -- will tell you it has a shot. Last month Atlantic LIVE and The Atlantic Cities, in partnership with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, brought a host of experts in business, tech, and urban planning together for a conference, Start-Up City: Miami, to discuss exactly that.
In the video above, we hear perspectives from conference speakers and travel to the colorful Wynwood arts district to visit the LAB Miami, a new coworking space in a 10,000-square foot warehouse. The city's creative class is thriving, Emily Badger writes, thanks in part to the symbiotic evolution of its art and tech scenes. "The idea is that artists from Miami’s deep-rooted cultural scene might rub elbows here with tech entrepreneurs, " Badger explains. "The LAB has been trying to achieve just the right mix of designers and developers, hackers and painters, architects and graphic artists."
Everyone we spoke with oozed enthusiasm for the seaside city and the opportunities there. Basking in breezy, 85-degree weather and endless sunshine, we were sorely tempted to cancel our return flights -- maybe even create an Atlantic satellite office in Wynwood.
The video above features music by the hyper-talented Alan Wilkis and satellite imagery from Google Earth. It was produced by Kasia Cieplak-Mayr von Baldegg, with thanks to Emma Green, Emily Badger, and the LAB Miami.

Ford Plans Market Test For Escape Electric Hybrid
NEW YORK April 17, 2003; Sharon Silke Carty writing for Dow Jones reported that Ford Motor Co. said it won't bring its hybrid electric version of the Ford Escape to mass market until it is satisfied the vehicle is bug-free.
Plans are still under way to introduce the sport utility vehicle to the consumer market in 2004. The hybrids will first be sold to fleet customers - like government entities, rental car companies like Ford's own Hertz, and corporate customers. Ford will use feedback gathered from those drivers to further tweak the SUVs.
"We won't release it until it's ready," said Jim O'Connor, Ford's vice president of North America marketing sales and service.
Prabhakar B. Patil, Ford's chief engineer of hybrid technologies, said the company has run extensive quality-control tests on the vehicle. The battery to run the engine is considerably larger than regular cars - it takes up the entire floor of the Escape's trunk. And since batteries can be temperamental in extreme weather, particularly hot temperatures, Ford had to make sure the battery was well ventilated.
"This type of battery has never been out in the field before," Patil said, noting that batteries operate best at around room temperature.
The rear windows of the Escape have a small vent built into them. Air is funneled through the vent and past the battery in an attempt to keep the unit cool. Computers continually monitor the battery temperature.
The company introduced its Escape hybrid at the New York Auto show. Patil said it should appeal to customers who enjoy the size of an SUV, but who feel guilty about driving less fuel-efficient vehicles.
Although hybrid electric engines are gaining in popularity, automakers are still unsure how large the market will be. Patil pointed out that they show their best fuel economy in urban settings, making them ideal for city drivers.
But the engines - which are fueled by gasoline but supplemented with electric energy - cost extra. Toyota Motor Corp.'s Prius is priced about $4,000 higher than its Corolla, which is a similar non-hybrid sedan. And Honda Motor Co.'s hybrid Civic costs $2,500 more.
Honda and Toyota hybrid sales amounted to 36,000 in 2002, leaving the automakers wondering whether consumers will pay the extra costs associated with the vehicles. A $3,000 tax incentive, in effect until 2006, may be cut down to $ 1,000, said O'Connor.
A recent survey by Internet auto site Autobytel, which pairs buyers with dealers, showed purchase requests for the Prius were up 58% in the first quarter.
"The survey, coupled with significant online interest in hybrids, suggests that a significant rise in U.S. hybrid sales may be just around the corner, as major automakers prepare to roll out hybrid-powered versions of several of their established, popular models," a press release issued by the company said.
Ford officials hope the Escape, already one of its more popular SUVs, will be a hit. One of the complaints consumers have voiced about the other hybrid vehicles on the market is that they are small.
After five years on the market, Toyota introduced its redesigned version of the Prius, which is about six inches longer and an inch higher. The trunk is more than four square feet larger as well.
Ford is also entering the hybrid sedan market. The Ford Futura, also introduced at the New York Auto Show, which is aimed at the mid-size car market, will be the company's second full-hybrid vehicle.
"Futura will offer a world-class powertrain for the economy-minded consumer, the enthusiast and the environmentally committed driver," said David Szczupak, vice president of Powertrain Operations.

Music and…: Five Ways to Think About the Crackdown on SF Venues
March 8, 2010
Written by Ben Van Houten venue under attack by the ABC. If you’re under 21, the places being targeted account for most of your concert-going options in the City. And therein lies much of the problem.
As many local media outlets have covered, for well over a year the ABC has been pursuing enforcement actions against local clubs that offer all ages shows. In several of these cases, the ABC alleges that the clubs have failed to meet conditions that are part of their liquor licenses, conditions that were either forced upon the clubs (that no one could have expected them to meet) or that the clubs never agreed to at all. Unbelievably, at the heart of a number of these enforcement actions is the claim that venues should be making as much money from food sales as they do from alcohol sales if they want to hold all ages shows.
January’s Flux Summit, titled What’s Shaking Down SF Music Venues?, was a welcome sign of increased action by local venues to distribute information about the attack they are facing (video from the summit here). With the stakes so high for some of the City’s best clubs, though, it’s a little disheartening that more people aren’t already aware of what’s going on. And yet, it’s not difficult to understand why many aren’t engaged in issues of regulatory enforcement, entertainment business licensing, and disputes over food-to-alcohol sales ratios. On the surface, these problems aren’t particularly accessible, compelling or sexy. The reality, however, is that the crackdown on SF venues isn’t just about local indie music. Instead, it touches on a number of concerns that should matter to a broad swath of San Franciscans.
In that vein, I offer:
Five Ways to Think About the Crackdown on SF Venues.
1. This isn’t just an indie music issue. It’s a performing arts issue.
Few things depress me more than the disconnect between indie music and the rest of the performing arts world, a topic worthy of a separate inquiry altogether. In any event, while I don’t expect fans of opera or classical music to see the venue crackdown as the first step toward an ABC attack on the War Memorial or Davies Hall, supporters of a vibrant performing arts community in San Francisco should be concerned about a coordinated assault on a segment of this community. Even if it’s not one’s particular cup of tea, live pop music is an important piece of our cultural fabric, and a vital art form. For some, it’s the only art form worth experiencing.
Moreover, it would be wrong to call the ABC-targeted venues just pop music spaces, as many of them also regularly host performances well beyond contemporary pop, like the Bluegrass Festival shows at Cafe Du Nord and Slim’s and Allen Toussaint’s concert last week at Great American. This is to say nothing of the many benefits and personally-important private events these venues have held. I went to a wedding at the Great American a month or so ago, a venue picked by the groom because of the many important musical experiences he’d had there.
2. This isn’t just an indie music issue. It’s a youth activities issue.
In the number of news stories written about the ABC’s crackdown, I haven’t seen the ABC offer any semblance of a justification for its attack on local clubs. Where is the statistical evidence that this crackdown is a reasonably targeted solution to a serious public safety issue? One suspects that if there really were even anecdotal examples of underage drinking or alcohol-related deaths connected to local clubs, or any other explanation for this bizarre assault, the ABC would have trotted them out by now, if only to justify their efforts to the state’s taxpayers. Instead, the silence is deafening.
On the flip side, I can identify with the young people who would suffer if the City’s all ages venues were forced to shut down. I was one of them, seeking refuge in all ages matinees at Bottom of the Hill and a perhaps embarrassing number of ska and punk shows at Slim’s. Young people have far too few options for entertainment in this City as it is (note for separate investigation — how do kids survive without Japantown Bowl?). Taking away some of their few options for safe, affordable, artistically-enriching fun is a big, big mistake.
3. This isn’t just an indie music issue. It’s a state interference issue.
The thoroughly arbitrary way that the ABC has pursued action against local music venues is further disconcerting because it’s difficult to see why the ABC would be limited to venue micro-management. Indeed, recent reports have exposed the ABC’s crackdown on the Bay Area’s celebrated mixologists, threatening local bars and restaurants that create their own infusion liquors. The infusion debacle contains all of the hallmarks of the ABC’s pursuit of venues: a heavy-handed approach that serves no clear public interest and that threatens to silence an area of local innovation and creativity.
There’s also no reason why the state agency should be expected to limit its assault to the Bay Area. As far as I can tell, there’s nothing particularly unique about San Francisco’s venues, such that folks in Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and elsewhere shouldn’t be worried about their local clubs. Indeed, rumblings emerged at the recent Flux Summit that the ABC is beginning to pursue actions against venues in other areas. If this effort isn’t stopped here, club owners around the state could find themselves defending their livelihoods in expensive litigation.
4. This isn’t just an indie music issue. It’s a business issue.
Live music may be hurting like every other industry, but the City ought to be concerned about the potential loss of tax dollars from the decimation of a bunch of long running live music establishments — to say nothing of the many people who would be out of jobs, or the risk that large numbers of musicians might be forced to bypass the Bay Area on their tours. How can the Mayor’s Office continue to ignore this problem, even if only from a dollars-and-cents perspective? Where is the Convention & Visitors Bureau on this?
5. This isn’t just an indie music issue. It’s a Future of San Francisco issue.
At its core, the question of whether we, as a local community, are willing to stand up for local music venues is really a question of what kind of city we want to have in the future. To allow the ABC to continue its quest unimpeded is to issue a death sentence to some of the City’s legendary venues, and with it, to declare that, unlike other world-class cities, San Francisco does not want to be known as a live music-friendly community. It’s also a middle finger to the City’s history of pioneering rock music.
I’d characterize the ABC’s position as a victory for NIMBY interests, but that wouldn’t give enough credit to the many venues that have worked hard to make sure that they are well-integrated into their communities, and respectful of their neighborhoods’ needs. There’s a reason that places like Bottom of the Hill and Du Nord haven’t engendered neighborhood backlash, and it’s not because they don’t have residents near them.
Final Thoughts
To the extent that the ABC’s enforcement actions are based on conditions that clubs agreed to abide by (even if everyone involved knew full well that they couldn’t be met), I am sympathetic to the idea that the agency is just trying to enforce agreed-upon rules. It would be foolish, though, to divorce these enforcement actions from their obvious consequences. If the clubs can’t survive with the rules enforced, then the rules shouldn’t be enforced and the system should be scrapped.
To that end, since these issues first came to light, and following an administrative court ruling favorable to the Great American Music Hall, there has been increased talk of revamping the liquor licensing system. Revamping the system seems like a sensible idea — the City’s rock clubs shouldn’t be forced to abide by rules intended for restaurants — but, despite expressing an interest in systemic reform, the ABC has appeared unwilling to stop its ongoing enforcement actions in the interim, forcing venue owners to continue to pay legal fees to fight their individual cases.
Additionally, simply promising change doesn’t tell anyone exactly what kind of change will be made. Given the ABC’s current position, seeking to impose and enforce bizarre and arbitrary rules, it’s tough to have confidence that the agency will seek to create a system that’s any more workable or reasonable for venue owners. Change in the right direction will require an informed public holding the state accountable for its actions. It’s not the most exciting stuff, but it’s a battle local music fans can’t afford to lose.
For more information about these issues, I’d encourage you to join the California Music and Culture Association and Stop the War on Fun! on Facebook, and follow the DNA Lounge’s blog as well. We’ll continue to track developments in these issues as well.
“Music and…” is a new monthly column from The Bay Bridged Programming Director Ben Van Houten exploring significant issues impacting music, culture and digital media.
Good job and well-written, Ben. It’s good to you doing some longer form writing like this. Keep it up.
Great article, more community reaction to these issues is vital to save our local music scene. Let’s all get involved!
San Francisco is not a world class city.
The ABC is currently operating as outlaws. They answer to nobody. This power was given to them because they issue the license. Of late they are allowed to violate the rights of those without a license. They are under no obligation to listen to a judge or judicial board. They make their ow rules, and their own laws.
They have become a rogue agency in California.
Plubbius: My guess (though I might be wrong) is that they do answer to the California legislature and their decisions can be overridden by that body. Just like the Board of Supervisors can get involved in SF permitting decisions. But the odds of protesting this decision to a level that anyone in Sacramento even notices (aside from SF’s supportive Ammiano) seems pretty tiny.
PLease keep me inform.
Julieta Zuniga
Music is highly over rated and sucks anyway. These cultural aspirations must be, at the very least, beaten out of today’s youth and quickly, before they grow up and try to change the laws. With all the free time on their hands, they can stay at home and clean up their rooms. About time cities are jumping on the church’s bandwagons. Ban music and dancing from all pubic places. PS, G_d told me to write this.

Auto Insurance Facts
When you decide to purchase a vehicle, one of the most important things you must do in the process is find auto insurance coverage. Finding the best insurance coverage at the best price can often times require a lot of research. Auto insurance varies by company as well as state so it is important to know what kind of coverage you need. The following facts on insurance are both interesting and may help you to find the best coverage.
Most Expensive States for Auto Coverage
- Washington D.C.
- New Jersey
- Louisiana
- New York
- Florida
- Massachusetts
- Rhode Island
- Delaware
- Nevada Connecticut
Least Expensive States for Auto Coverage
- North Dakota
- Iowa
- South Dakota
- Idaho
- Kansas
- Nebraska
- Wisconsin
- North Carolina
- Indiana
- Maine
Most Expensive Cities for Auto Insurance
- Detroit, Michigan
- Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
- Newark, New Jersey
- Los Angeles, California
- Hempstead, New York
Least Expensive Cities for Auto Insurance
- Eau Claire, Wisconsin
- Norfolk, Virginia
- Raleigh, North Carolina
- Burlington, Vermont
- Sioux Falls, South Dakota
Factors That Affect Your Insurance Rates
- Motor Vehicle Records
- Insurance History (including past claims)
- Accidents and Violations
- Credit History (most companies will not look at your credit report but will use your credit history to determine which group the applicant is placed in)
Other Interesting Insurance Facts
- The type of car you drive affects your insurance rates, small sporty cars are going to be much more expensive than mid sized cars with many safety features.
- Comprehensive coverage is not the same as complete coverage, comprehensive coverage only means that your auto is covered in scenarios other than collisions such as vandalism, fire damage, theft, etc.
- It is possible to ask your insurance company for discounts, most companies offer various discounts such as safe driver, and student discounts among others.
- Never let your insurance policy lapse, driving without insurance will wind up being very costly and will affect you getting insurance with another company in the future.
Considering we are one of the most populated states in the country North Carolina still comes in as one of the lease expensive states to have auto insurance. Just another reason to come and see what North Carolina is all about. If you have coverage and would like a second opinion don’t hesitate to call my office anytime.

Courtesy, calming atmosphere, great top notch surroundings/decor and the most efficient stylists I have come across. I definitely recommend the conditioning treatment and am so pleased that I have booked an appointment for next week for a full colour application. Well done and thank you for being here in Sittingbourne xx
Finally found a salon that not only keeps up to date on all the latest treatments and styles, but also offers friendly and helpful advice on all aspects of hair and beauty treaments! Parking is free and always guaranteed and so are the endless cups of refreshments.Thank-you for the fantastic service, I always feel like a princess when leaving :)
This is a really friendly salon, which always seems to keep up with the current trends in hair and beauty. I can always know that I will be given the 5* treatment
I have worked at naturally.u since I was 14, im now 21 I have loved my time here the clients are great and my colleagues are great. We all really enjoy working here. Bryony Cross

I thought this odd at the time and it took me a bit to realize it was in fact a type of censorship and attempt to defalut through and stifle dissent..ie...censorship...control...guilt manipulation.
Over time I began to realize that this control/censorship fingerprint was being picked up by many of the nations minorities in reinforcing their "Victimhood " status since public education and televisions and movies send out the message that "Victims " automatically default through at the expense and on the purse of everyone else.
I think the proper term you describe would be to "nullify", where instead of 2 valid opinions in a matter both standing with their own merits, they invoke the anti-semitic card, play the race card, or the homophobe card, to label your opinion as tainted. This effectively dismisses it, and renders it null, void, and without any merit. It is a tactic to avoid having to concede their plights may not be all that true.

Sustrans' cycle route 72 from South Shields, Tyne & Wear to Silloth in Cumbria, taking in Hadrians' Wall en-route, and specifically the section from Hexham to Haltwhistle passes right by the door of the Boatside Inn. Why not make the Boatside Inn a stopover point for the night, its approximately 40 miles from South Shields.Check out the Sustrans web site for other appropriate routes in Northumberland, such as the "Coasts and Castles" route from Tynemouth to Berwick, or the "Reivers Cycle Route" from Tynemouth to Whitehaven.For those who want to bring their bikes just for a potter around, you can follow the section of route 72 down the path beside the railway line to Tyne Green Hexham, roughly following the river.
For mountain bike enthusiasts, Kielder Forest is probably the best place to go, and you can even hire a bike there normally.
The river Tyne is regarded by many as England's premier Salmon fishing river. You can book fishing through. Details of tariffs and beats can be found on this site. You will of course need your own rod licence, obtainable from the Post Office to fish.
Please contact 01434 602233 if you are interested in either combining a stay in the B & B or Self Catering accommodation together with your fishing
Note: The season for salmon on the English rivers is 1 February to 31 October but a "catch and release" byelaw obliges the return of any salmon caught before 16 June. There is no "catch and release" for sea trout and the season is from 3 April to 31 October.
Other well know rivers in the area include the Tweed (classed as a Scottish river), which is under two hours away, and the Coquet a little over an hour way.
There are also excellent lakes and reservoirs to fish in the area, including Kielder (recent site for the National Fly Fishing Championship) being only 30 minutes away, and Derwent a very similar distance in the other direction.

Is there anyone who isn't dieting these days? No carb, low carb, low calorie, low fat, Atkins, Dukan, South Beach, California, lo GI, high fibre, I could fill this article with fad diets. Often these cause water weight loss, which invariably returns like many bad pennies. Sometimes they cause real weight loss but the dieter gains a very bad mood. My father always used to say eats everything in moderation and exercise and the scales will be fine. But what if there were some foods that could tip them, just a little, in your favour. Fat burning foods? Could this miracle even be possible?
Manisha Malhotra, administrator of Mittal Champions Trust, thinks it can. She says that there are foods that can burn fat better than others. Foods that use more energy to digest work in this manner. But there is a rider. You can't eat a cartload of French fries and then munch celery sticks and hope the fat doesn't stick. It will and in all the wrong places. But if you do load up on some fat burners, then you can increase your metabolic rate that can help you shed those extra kilos. We will reveal some of these fat zappers to you but first, a little science. How does fat get deposited in all the wrong places? The body needs energy to function. The energy from foods is measured in layman terms are ‘calories'. The more calories, the more energy. The body also uses some of this energy to digest the food itself so some old energy gets used to make new energy. Ergo, the harder the food is to digest, the more energy it uses. The food consumed gives fuel to the body in the form of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It uses what it needs and stores the rest as fat in fat cells. Now the tricky part. There are limited fat cells and when those are filled up, fat gets stored in muscle linings. The more fat deposited, the more they expand and then it becomes flab and the trouble.
Now some foods contain certain vitamins and minerals that help improve body metabolism and improves fat burning capacity. Others contain low calories but require greater digestion making what they use greater than what they give. (This is why sometimes too much of a low calorie intake often make people feel weak and tired)
Eating some of the fat burning foods, in the right quantities, over a period of time, your fat profile will reducing. Here's the list:
Citrus fruits: These are probably the number one fat burning foods. Starting the day with a breakfast of citrus foods will definitely show positive results. Citrus fruits provide easy energy to spike metabolism while supplying a vitamin C booster, which is scientifically known to bust the fat.
Oats: Oats are great foods to wolf down because a large portion of their calorific content comes from fibre. This Fibre tricks you in to feeling full and fibre makes your gut work harder.
Vegetables: Veggies like broccoli, spinach, peas, cabbage and carrots are excellent providers of minerals while being low on calories and high on fibre. One more reason to eat your veggies!
Lentils: These foods are not only filling and nutritious but also jam-packed with proteins/amino-acids; all good for keeping the fat cell count down.
Poultry: For the non-vegetarian, chicken, chicken chicken. Its lower on fat than red meats and because it is high protein, its more complex to assimilate and digest. Avoid the skin and go for leaner cuts whenever possible.
Almonds and Walnuts: Haven't you had a bowl of almonds as a bar snack and then felt too full for a big main course? These fantastic snack foods can help you feel satiated with just a fistful of these nuts. Nuts are a great factory for good fats that you should eat because people who don't consume healthy fats are more likely to gain weight than people who do.
Fish: Fish is a mine of protein and healthy fats (romega-3, omega-6), and in particular salmon, mackerel, trout and tuna are not only tasty are the ones which will help you turn the fight the flab.
Water: The world's super drink! No calories. Not one single one. And a real fat burner because it ups the metabolic rate and helps melt the fat away.
Now take your pick, mix and match, and transform in to a lean, mean fat burning machine!
ANY DIET / NUTRITION PLAN SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN AFTER CONSULTING A DOCTOR.

This is an image of an old candy trade from June 2007 from a good Japanese friend of mine. It’s a great example of candy that’s been tapered to Japanese tastes. The flavors shown here are Red (Adzuki) bean, Green Tea and Black Sesame, all flavors which the Japanese people associate with sweets and have been used in confections for centuries. It’s cool to see how these flavors are now incorporated into modern candy.

hello all,
i'd love to get some feedback from those of you doing retail and using any software that maintains your recipe database and then develops the necessary ingredient list for labeling packages for collections. i've seen a number of programs out there and wondered if anyone could recommend one in particular.
i am small-time currently, so i don't need to do a nutrition label - just the ingredient list in descending weight order and allergy statement. but my collections vary frequently, so re-creating that list is cumbersome and tedious. thanks in advance for your thoughts! ALSO, i'd appreciate any negatives about software if you've bought it and hate it and wish you'd gotten something else. all info is helpful.
Views: 338
I've been using the info generator on
Pretty simple to use and all they require is that you leave the url on the label.
Really, appreciate you sharing this with us. Many Thanks!
Yours in Spirit,
Julie Bolejack

"This is a moment of real significance for our nation" ... Julia Gillard.
JULIA Gillard and Tony Abbott have declared today's 10th anniversary of the Bali bombings an occasion to remember the best of human nature as well as the worst.
In articles written for today's Herald, both leaders have also drawn on their personal experiences as they recounted the horror of a decade ago.
Ms Gillard, Mr Abbott and John Howard, who as prime minister led the nation in its response to the tragedy, will represent Australia at today's ceremony in Bali. The Herald can also reveal that Mr Abbott will then travel to Jakarta for high level meetings with Indonesian officials to discuss issues including asylum seekers.
Ms Gillard flew home from a holiday in Bali with her sister and nephew the day before the October 12, 2002, bombings and recounted her deep shock as she empathised with the families of those killed and injured.
''I could only imagine how my family would have felt if our holiday had been timed slightly differently,'' she wrote. ''I could picture my parents desperately trying to find out whether members of my family were safe.
''That was the torment so many Australian families went through on that dreadful day.''
Mr Abbott was holidaying in Bali in 2005 and was caught up in the second attacks. He helped tend and evacuate the wounded.
''I have never been prouder of the quality of our diplomats and defence personnel and the grit and stoicism of our people,'' Mr Abbott wrote.
Bali's police have been put on high alert for the event on the holiday island, amid warnings from one senior Bali police officer on Wednesday of specific information about a threat to VIPs attending.
Other Indonesian officials and high-level Australian sources downplayed the security concerns, however. And Australians in Bali for the service said yesterday they were undeterred by any security threats.
''This is a moment of real significance for our nation,'' Ms Gillard said yesterday.
''Ten years ago I think we would all remember where we were and how we felt, how shocked we were.
''I want to spend some time with the families who have really had to absorb such grief.
Mr Abbott wrote that the bombings could have turned Australia and Indonesia against each other. ''Instead, we turned towards each other and today have a very strong friendship, despite recent challenges for the relationship,'' he wrote.
Mr Howard made the same point yesterday. He recounted how the terrorist attacks occurred just three years after Australia intervened to liberate East Timor and relations between Jakarta and Canberra were still very fractious.
''But instead of the two countries being pushed further apart, they were brought closer together,'' Mr Howard said.
Mr Abbott has also used the anniversary to push his policy proposal to pay Australian victims of terrorist attacks up to $75,000 in compensation.
The government has agreed to adopt the measure for victims of future attacks, but not make it retrospective. Ms Gillard said the government had helped those families and victims wishing to go to Bali for the ceremony.

Crimson Winks Squad Downs Two Opponents
The athlete's muscles rippled as he prepared to shoot the final point of the match; the tendon on his left index finger looked red and strained, but he was a true tiddlywinker and would not flinch. After a fleeting glace towards the victor's decanter of sherry, he squidged, scored, and the Gargoyles had downed Penn 26-9 in last Saturday's match.
Gargoyle captain Jim Parry described the match as a pushover, and lauded the skillful efforts of shooter John Kernochan and squopper Tom Houston, Saturday's high scorers.
Parry is delighted with the team's success, and has even gone so far as to claim that the Gargoyles could defeat Oxford's world champions in a return match.

Most Agree, Pettit's Goal Was In
Assistant captain Tyler Kolarik scored a goal in each of the weekend's ECAC quarterfinal games, including the game-tying goal that sent the teams into overtime on Saturday night.
Same goes for his teammates on the ice. And everyone on the Harvard bench. And at least one Brown player, along with, we presume, most of the 1,528 on hand.
If majority ruled at Meehan Auditorium, Crimson senior winger Tim Pettit would’ve been awarded the game-winning goal at 1:40 of overtime Saturday night. After all, even the great Yann Danis had put his head down, seemingly conceding defeat to the Harvard skaters buzzing about him with glee.
This one was over, right?
Well, no. The two most important people in the building when it comes to such matters—the goal judge and referee Scott Hansen—didn’t see Pettit’s laser sail over Danis’s glove and pop out, quicker than you could say, “Albany.” Serves Pettit right, you might say, for possessing a vicious slapshot that can be unseeable, unstoppable or both.
“I knew it didn’t go over the crossbar, so I had the idea that it went in, but I wasn’t positive,” Pettit said. “Everyone up top saw it go in…I got all of it, that’s for sure.”
After a quick but spirited dispute, however, the teams played on. One felt as if it had been robbed. The other was thankful for new playoff life.
In the end, the team that deserved to win, won. Harvard junior Tom Cavanagh scored about six minutes later to send his team to Albany with a 3-2 victory.
With that, all was forgiven.
“I could care less now because we won. Who cares?” Pettit asked. “If we would’ve lost, that would’ve been a big hit.
“But after [the non-goal], Danis psyched himself out. It was only a matter of time before we scored.”
Pettit may have missed out on what would’ve been his first overtime winner in a Crimson sweater, but he certainly did not go home empty-handed. His parting gifts included a pretty important goal of his own—coming less than 30 seconds after Brown took a 2-0 lead in the second—and the honor of playing more games (132) than anyone else in Harvard hockey history, breaking the old mark of former captain Steve Armstrong ’88.
Both coaches agreed that Pettit’s goal, coming on a 2-on-1 with Charlie Johnson at 11:03 of the second, changed the game’s momentum. Pettit tipped it into the air, off Danis, and barely over the line for his 10th goal of the season, second of the series.
“Charlie just made a great pass, right over the guy’s stick,” Pettit said. “Danis made a great save just to stop the puck, but luckily it went over the net. It’s nice to have a lucky bounce every once in awhile.”
Pettit said he didn’t know about the record until Harvard assistant director of athletic communications Jamie Weir told him about it earlier this season.
“It feels good to have played that many games in my career,” said Pettit, also tied for 16th in school history with 136 career points. “It’s definitely something I’m proud of.”
The record is a tribute to Pettit’s durability. He has missed only two games (the Princeton-Yale road trip as a freshman) over four years. His teammates, though, joke that he has the “most games played but least amount of preseason runs” because of conditioning sessions he’s missed due to injury.
Cavanagh and Ryan Lannon recently became the first juniors to play 100 games for Harvard. Barring injuries, one or both may pass Pettit next season.
“Some guys are probably going to break it next year, but it’s nice to have now,” Pettit said. “But really, all I’m interested in now is getting on the ice in Albany. All individual things aside, the seniors just want to go out on a winning note.”
REESE LETS IT RIP
As the second period wound down Saturday, Harvard freshman defenseman Dylan Reese had the puck just inside the blue line with a clear look at the net.
But he waited too long to pull the trigger, and a defender blocked it.
“I should’ve shot the puck,” Reese lamented. “I had a lane.”
In a similar situation at a more critical stage—7:35 into overtime—he didn’t hesitate, which is one big reason why the Crimson is still playing hockey this season.
Reese was left unmarked at the point because pressure from Harvard’s forwards had forced Brown’s wingers to help down low. He saw a lot of dark sweaters in front of the goal and had “all day” to send in his wrister.
“I was having a lot of my shots blocked in that game and the first game, so I was worried about getting it on net,” Reese said. “I wasn’t looking to score. I was hoping he’d kick it out, because we had three guys in front, and he did.”
Cavanagh put the rebound five-hole to send the Crimson to the ECAC semifinals for the fourth straight season, extending what is now the longest active streak in the league.
WORTH THE TRIP
With a 7-1-1 record over its last nine games, you could say Harvard is back. Same goes for the student fan base.
Over 100 clever, crimson-clad students made the trip to Meehan Auditorium for both games and often out-chanted the home supporters. Crimson captain Kenny Smith said it was the best road crowd he has seen for Harvard during his career, and said the team appreciated it.
“Going into another team’s rink with that much support from our fans means a lot to the guys,” he said. “They were awesome. That type of atmosphere is what makes college hockey so special.”
H-Club Co-President Nicholas Shiftan ’04 said his organization plans to send a bus to Albany for the ECAC championships, beginning with Friday’s 7:45 p.m. semifinal against Dartmouth. Shiftan said the H-Club would likely send out details of the trip tonight via e-mail.
“After this weekend’s turnout, we’re very confident that Harvard students are willing to make this trip,” he said. “We had well over 100 Harvard students who arranged their own transportation and really outdid the Brown fans. You couldn’t tell the game was at Brown.”
MILESTONE AND MIDTERMS
Harvard coach Mark Mazzoleni was happy with Saturday’s win for a number of reasons. In addition to clinching the series, it was also his 300th career victory.
“That just means I’m getting old,” Mazzoleni said with a laugh. “You’ve got to be around a little bit to win 300 games.”
Mazzoleni still remembers his first win: an 8-0 victory at Wisconsin-Superior in 1985, his first season at Wisconsin-Stevens Point.
“There are a lot of good memories in there,” he said.
Mazzoleni was also happy to wrap it up in two for an entirely different reason: his players’ midterms.
“Thank God we [didn’t] have to play Sunday,” he said. “It’s going to be a tough week as it is, with where we are academically.”
Cavanagh has three midterms this week.
“It’s nice to have some extra time,” he said.
BRIEFLY
Senior winger Kenny Turano, who missed almost the entire regular season with an ankle injury, was in the lineup for the Beanpot consolation and every game since, but missed both games this weekend with a leg injury sustained in practice. Sophomore Dan Murphy skated in his place and was minus-2 with two shots on goal. Mazzoleni said Turano will be re-evaluated this week…Before Saturday, the Bears hadn’t lost when leading after two since Jan. 28, 2003 and hadn’t blown a two-goal lead all season. But they are now 0-10-1 when the opponent scores three or more goals.

Obamacare Supporters Ousted in the Last Election Are Cheered by Court Ruling
Supporting the Affordable Care Act cost some legislators their seats. The court ruling provides some satisfaction, writes Allison Yarrow.
They hesitate to call it vindication. But politicians who lost office for supporting Obamacare are some of the happiest campers after the Supreme Court’s ruling upholding most of the law.
“I’m energized, and it's not just the coffee,” said an elated Tom Perriello, a former Virginia congressman, shortly after the ruling was announced.

“I knew in my heart that they would rule with us,” said former North Carolina congressman Bob Etheridge, who served that state’s 2nd Congressional District for more than 13 years. Etheridge likened the decision to America’s pastime, particularly for opponents: “It’s like playing baseball. You may really believe that ball coming across that plate is not a strike, but if an umpire calls it a strike, it’s a strike.”
Etheridge and Perriello are two of many senators and congressmen and women who were ousted from office in 2010, in large part for voting for the Affordable Care Act. Theirs and others’ losses were marked in part by dirty tricks—political wrangling like expensive attack ads by outside interests pitting them against seniors or for death panels, gotcha tactics, and even vandalism by alleged Tea Party radicals.
Etheridge apologized after a video surfaced of him manhandling “a couple of hired goons from the Republican National Committee” who cut him off on the sidewalk and demanded he share whether he backed the president’s agenda. The video was viewed nearly 170,000 times.
When a former Marine bad-mouthed government programs at a North Carolina health-care forum, Etheridge asked him, “Do you have health care?” insinuating the government role in providing it. The video’s poster couched the event as “Mr. Etheridge humiliating himself.”
“Here’s what bothers me about all this. People who vote to deny it are the first ones to step up to take government subsidies,” Etheridge said.
Looking back on that time, Etheridge, who ran a last-minute, unsuccessful campaign for governor in his state—he characterized the loss as “eight weeks and not enough votes”—calls the events in the videos “the kind of ugly, nasty, divisive politics I hope American people are ready to move past.” But with a House vote demanded by opponents to overturn the law—scheduled for after July 4—moving beyond the divide could still be hard.
Alan Grayson, a former Florida congressman, said he was unseated by negative ads run by 60 Plus, the conservative seniors initiative that positions itself across the aisle from AARP. The group said it spent nearly $1 million to topple Grayson and a neighboring district’s congresswoman, accusing them of cutting “$500 billion from Medicare” and willingly sticking it to seniors. He was a vocal advocate of the public option while in Congress, and said he thought that when he left office that the health-care conversation would finally be over, too. Grayson is running to reclaim his post now, and says despite opposition to the law from much of Florida, including its governor, Rick Scott, his district favors the reform and considers it sound policy.
“The constitutional arguments against the law were farcical. Nobody gave them credence until the right manufactured excuses,” said Grayson, who studied constitutional law at Harvard. “I never felt that there was any question about this. It’s good that the Supreme Court saw the light.”
“The frustrating thing about being in Congress was that facts didn’t seem to matter as much as they should,” said former Virginia congressman Tom Perriello. “Our politics are better when facts matter.”
Perriello, now president and CEO at the Center for American Progress, predicted Chief Justice John Roberts’s turn to side with the liberal justices and uphold the individual mandate, the backbone of the law, when he spoke to The Daily Beast in March. He said Roberts, who is known for caring how he is portrayed in the media, prioritized his legacy with this decision, choosing to side with the Constitution over the Articles of Confederation, the country’s founding document that empowered individuals over big government. It’s a debate that many find strange to see raging in the 21st century.
“The frustrating thing about being in Congress was that facts didn’t seem to matter as much as they should. Our politics are better when facts matter,” he said.
The bitterness hit for Perriello when alleged Tea Party activists targeted his family and threatened their safety. Authorities found a cut propane-gas tank at the home of Perriello's brother, and suspected the attack was intended for him. Perriello hails from a family of doctors, so he said there was no way he wouldn't champion sweeping health-care coverage for all.
Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu “suffered the slings and arrows of public opinion,” in 2009 and 2010, while she was still debating her position on it, according to a former aide. Her own staff members said they had no idea whether or not the senator would support the law even as she entered the chamber to vote. “I remember crafting two statements at every point,” another former aide said.
That aide remembers an August 2009 town-hall meeting in the state in which health-care-reform skeptics tailgated with Louisiana State University tents, and booed and accosted the senator and her staff before the debate could begin. This predated the Senate bill (there was only a draft in the House), and Landrieu was far from decided on whether or not she would support what would be drawn up. She even sustained attacks from multiple Republican governors while trying to keep her Senate seat, which she still holds.
When the Supreme Court ruled, former and current Landrieu staff, including those who helped author parts of the Senate bill, circulated celebratory emails, and shared moments of reminiscence—sleepless nights they now deem worth the uphill climb and opposition vitriol.
“[It] will improve health outcomes for our entire population. Now that the Supreme Court has made this clear by its ruling, it is the obligation of the states to fully implement and expedite the Affordable Care Act,” Landrieu said in a statement.
Despite all the spitball lobbing, lying, and rage unleashed on Democrats in 2010, the former legislators who supported a bill that could save some 45,000 lives and insure millions for the first time are happy about it being upheld by the land’s highest court. Perhaps it’s unsurprising that many of them want back in the game.
“Teddy Roosevelt is smiling right now,” Etheridge said.

Paul Ryan on the Issues: Taxes, Abortion, & More
Mitt Romney may have a reputation for flip-flopping, but his new running mate is known for taking a tough stance on everything from gun control to gay rights. We break down Ryan’s position on seven key topics.|.S. government's deficit by $4.4 trillion over 10 years. Ryan's plan, dubbed "The Path to Prosperity," distinguishes itself from President Obama's budget by cutting many government programs that serve the poor in order to save money and by lowering taxes for the wealthy. Ryan’s proposal would also repeal Obamacare and make sweping changes to Medicaid and Medicare, creating voucher systems for health care. Mitt Romney applauded the budget proposal, literally, and it has recently become known, particularly by Democratic opponents, as the Romney-Ryan plan.

Abortion
It probably comes has little surprise that the conservative Ryan is opposed to abortion in almost all situations other than to save a mother's life. Back in 2010, Ryan wrote a paper for The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, contradicting Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels's plea for politicians to "call a truce on social issues." In the paper, Ryan declared, "You're not going to have a truce. Judges are going to come up. Issues come up, they're unavoidable, and I'm never not going to vote pro-life."
Gay Rights
When it comes to gay rights, Ryan is not exactly an advocate. While he has voted to prohibit job discrimination based on sexual preference, Ryan has also voted both to define marriage as between one man and woman and for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. He also voted to ban gay adoptions in D.C., opposed the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell, and opposed the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a law signed by President Obama that expands the federal definition of hate crimes to apply to cases of bias against sexual orientation. The Human Rights Campaign has given him a 0-percent rating on their congressional scorecard for his anti-gay record.
Crime
In keeping with his stance on gay rights, Ryan has voted against enforcing hate crimes based on sexual orientation. When it comes to other kinds of crimes, he's pretty tough. He's voted against creating more services to help criminals re-enter society and opposed funding that would go towards alternative sentencing as opposed to building more prisons. He also voted yes to increase prosecution and sentencing of juveniles.
Financial Regulation
Unlike some of his colleagues, Paul Ryan, in his 2013 budget, does not call for an outright appeal of Dodds-Frank, the Democrat-sponsored law that set up new financial regulations in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis—though he did opposite it while it was a bill. Ryan recommends a “review” of the law. One thing he wants to get rid of is the federal government’s resolution authority, which allows it to break up big banks deemed “Too Big to Fail.” Ryan says that will only lead to more bailouts. Elsewhere, Ryan concedes that the government does have a role to play in ensuring fair markets, and at one point in 2012 appeared to express sympathy for the Volcker Rule, which prohibits big banks from engaging in risky trades.
The Environment
Climate-change and environmental activisits are unlikely to give high marks to Ryan, who has voted to eliminate EPA limits on greenhouse gases, cancel a ban on incandescent light bulbs, and go ahead with construction of the controversial Keystone oil pipeline. On his Web site, Ryan does note that “strong conservation programs” are important to him, but laments that federal spending in that area has climbed during the Obama administration. Ryan calls for more domestic energy production and “market-based solutions.” Ryan opposed a cap-and-trade program on energy in 2009, calling it “job-killing.”
Guns
Gun remain a hot topic in the wake of a shooting at Sikh temple last week in Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin. The congressman has an A rating from the NRA, representing a firm stance in favor of gun rights. Ryan has voted to decrease waiting periods to buy guns and to prohibit suing gun manufacturers for misuse of their products. Oh, and he supports Young Guns, too: that’s the name of a 2010 manifesto, written with fellow Rep. Eric Cantor, urging reform in the Republican party.

Ninety percent of the cases could be tracked to other countries. Until last year, there had been only about 60 cases per year between 2001 and 2010. Last year had the highest number since 1996, when there were 508 cases. The NCIRD director said: “We don’t have to have this much measles. Measles is preventable. Unvaccinated people put themselves and other people at risk for measles and its complications.”

The Band’s singer and drummer Levon Helm died Thursday at the age of 71, his former bandmate has confirmed. Helm had been battling throat cancer since the late ‘90s and had recently canceled his upcoming shows due to the progressing illness. Born in Arkansas in 1940, Helm joined a backup band of Ronnie Hawkins, and met a group of musicians that would eventually form The Band. The musicians broke from Hawkins and formed their own group, and their association with Bob Dylan helped capitulate them to fame. Diagnosed with throat cancer in the early 1990s, Helm underwent 28 radiation treatments and eventually recovered his voice.

The woman believed to be at the center of the Secret Service Colombian sex scandal appears to have moved out of her apartment. Neighbors believe she was the woman who got into a heated argument with one of the agents at a Cartagena hotel over payment for sex, prompting police to intervene. Eleven agents and 10 military members are now under investigation for their involvement. The woman, who has been described as a 24-year-old Colombian, took her son with her but sent a neighbor to pick up her dog.

33. Karzai: Troops Photo ‘Disgusting’
The Afghan government has condemned the photos of U.S. soldiers posing with the mangled remains of Afghan suicide bombers, with President Karzai denouncing the images in a statement as “inhuman” and “disgusting” and calling for a swift transition from NATO to Afghan security to prevent “any bad actions by foreign troops.” The pictures have drawn attention to a perceived breakdown in leadership and discipline during the war and heightened tensions between the U.S. and Afghanistan as the Obama administration pushes to sign a strategic deal with Karzai on foreign presence in the country. Meanwhile, the Taliban has vowed to seek revenge against U.S. troops in the country.

A Team of Expatriates
Many of Obama's top advisers, like an increasing number of Americans, have learned and lived abroad.
II..
For Jarrett's family, who traveled extensively even after they returned to the United States when Valerie was six, that meant socializing with people from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. "You appreciate and are maybe more open to different perspectives," she says.
It's a common point among Obama's top aides, a surprising number of whom grew up in other countries—the insight they developed by seeing America from the outside in. The former expats include retired Marine Gen. James L. Jones, the incoming national-security adviser, who lived in France for most of his childhood; Timothy Geithner, the nominee for Treasury secretary, who grew up in Zimbabwe, India and Thailand; retired Maj. Gen. J. Scott Gration, a child of missionaries in Africa who is a leading contender to become the new NASA administrator; and Jarrett, a close personal friend of the Obamas' who will serve as a top domestic-policy adviser.
Obama has identified his years in Indonesia, and later travels in Pakistan, as critical to shaping his views on America's role in the world. "If you don't understand these cultures, then it's very hard for you to make good foreign-policy decisions," he told an Iowa campaign crowd in 2007. "The benefit of my life of having both lived overseas and traveled overseas … is I have a better sense of how they're thinking and what their society is really like."
Most of the world doesn't associate that kind of understanding with Americans, and with some reason. Even now, only about 22 percent of Americans have passports, while in many Western European countries the number is much higher—reaching 71 percent in the United Kingdom. But as the world shrinks, the numbers of Americans working and studying outside of the country is rising. In 2006–07, more than 241,000 Americans studied abroad, up from less than 100,000 who did so a decade earlier. The State Department estimates that more than 5 million Americans live overseas. For the generation of Americans coming of age now, some of the most significant opportunities—for work, investment, recreation and learning—will be global.
Gration left America in 1952, when he boarded a ship called the African Lightning and steamed out of New York harbor at the age of about 18 months. His parents were missionaries with the Africa Inland Mission. They were heading to the Kenyan port of Mombasa, and then inland by car to the Congo. Three times the family had to flee the Congo—after independence and a military coup in 1960, after the execution of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba in 1961 and lastly during civil war in 1964. The family lost everything then, and settled in Kenya before returning to the United States in 1967. "You spend some time [in a country] and all of a sudden you can't stay in your house because the rebels are coming," says Gration. "Life itself is a gift and now you realize that freedom and life, those things we [Americans] take for granted, those values you can't put your arms around, are so precious and worth dying for."
Gration first met Obama when he was serving as director of Strategy, Plans and Policy for the European Command. In that capacity, he briefed then Senator Obama on foreign affairs, and later joined him on a trip to Africa in 2006. Last year, Gration left the Republican Party to vote for Obama in the New Jersey primary. He was attracted by Obama's interest in issues "that are borderless": the environment, trade, energy, human rights. "When you grow up as I did, surrounded by Africans, you see them as individuals—the kids I grew up with, the kids I played soccer with, [the people with whom] I went and ate around the fires," says Gration. "These were my African buddies, and so for me, when I see the strife in Darfur and when I see what's happening in eastern Congo, it's not just a problem. It's people."
Expats also learn, in a personal way, the resentments that foreigners sometimes feel toward the United States. Growing up in France after World War II, the future General Jones went to local schools outside of Paris, then to a NATO school. "In postwar France there was a lot of anti-American sentiment because of the number of bases we had and the heavy footprint we showed."
As a child and a teen, Jones would return to Missouri for two-week stints every few years, and he yearned for the kind of life where he could play baseball instead of soccer and fencing. But he also recalls watching footage of the civil-rights movement—the marches, the struggle for school integration in Little Rock, the atrocities of the Ku Klux Klan—on French television. "It was absolutely just a surreal experience for me," he says. He was very proud to be American, yet also shocked and confused by what he was watching.
Relatives in the United States sent Jones care packages—blue jeans and other American-style clothes. When he rode the French buses, the locals thought he was a tourist. "What they didn't know was that I understood everything they were saying," he says. "It wasn't always very flattering." One morning, his father woke up to find U.S. GO HOME splashed in white paint on his black Chevrolet Bel Air. At other times, tensions resulted in conflict. " I got in more fights as a kid as a result of nationality than any other reason."
But Jones grew fond of France, and he also had classmates from Germany, Spain and other NATO countries. That proved useful when he became Supreme Allied Commander in Europe years later. "You develop a fine ear for listening to nuance, and to what it is people are saying, but also how they are saying it," he says. "You have to be able to look at the same problem through different prisms to be … successful in the international environment."
Now Jones encourages young people to go out and see other countries and cultures. Anyone who has the opportunity and doesn't seize it "is really missing out on one of the most important components of how to be successful in today's shrinking world," he says. "And if you're going to hold national office, I think it's an imperative." Obama would surely agree.

It’s the Euro, Stupid: The Roots of the Euro-Zone Crisis
Europe is in a hole, and it won’t stop digging..
In a sense, the euro is still tainted by that original sin. Something that should have been an enthusiastic step toward more unity had become the product of a cold, realpolitik tradeoff. Adopted by the 12 members of the then–European Community at Maastricht in February 1992, the monetary union was put to the democratic test only twice. The Danes rejected it in June of the same year, while the French endorsed it by only the narrowest margin in September, even though every mainstream political party had recklessly campaigned in its favor. The lesson was not lost on other European governments: with very few exceptions, they conspicuously avoided any form of democratic test of the European idea from that moment onward.
There is little doubt that the euro came far too early into the European project. A monetary union implies a high degree of preexisting economic, political, and social integration in order to succeed. Clearly the Europe of 1999 did not qualify, irrespective of the flawed criteria of convergence adopted at Maastricht. Huge gaps in productivity, very different demographics, and a rather low level of internal workforce mobility combined with the absence of a federal budget or tax system could only trigger increasing levels of economic divergence rather than convergence. During the initial decade of the euro, labor costs effectively diverged by nearly 50 percent between the most and least successful countries. As a result, massive intrazone trade deficits built up, with soaring public indebtedness in the weaker countries as a consequence. As devaluations could no longer occur to rebalance these economies, some argue that deflation should have materialized instead. It did not. The weaker countries benefited from the explicit support of the European Central Bank that treated all sovereign bonds of the zone on equal footing in its refinancing operations. As such, interest rates in all peripheral countries fell to levels that could only propel excessive monetary growth in a speculative direction, further increasing competitiveness gaps.
We are now in the euro’s 14th and maybe final year. The main European governments have largely sidelined the mostly unrepresentative European institutions while denying their responsibility and, instead, blaming obscure market forces or supposedly lazy and dishonest Southern Europeans. Driven by the narrowest sense of what they perceive to be their immediate interests, they opted against any form of European solidarity. The public debt of Greece amounted to less than 2 percent of the combined GDP of the European Union. The core countries could have easily absorbed it.
In Brussels, a protester gives vent to his feelings. (Ye Pingfan / Xinhua-Corbis)
That the European states proved unable to do so illustrates how monetary unions can neither function in the absence of a prior form of deep political integration nor create it among unwilling partners. How the EU may now disintegrate is simple: once combined levels of public debt, interest rates, unemployment, external account deficits, and absence of internal solidarity make clear to everyone that several sovereign entities are heading toward default and potential exit from the euro zone, anyone with any common sense must open bank accounts in Germany and wire money outside of the threatened countries’ banking system. The peripheral central banks have then to borrow from the European Central Bank, which in turn obtains the excess liquidity accumulated by the German banking system. It is then in Germany’s interest to leave the system sooner rather than later before the size of its credit position becomes too high, while the Greek elections illustrate a desperate call toward more solidarity rather than a genuine desire to leave the monetary union. If one looks at the precedent set by the disintegrating Ruble currency area that survived the U.S.S.R., the countries that left it first were the Baltic states and not the Central Asian republics.
The other option is more European union. In an ideal situation, a common budget and tax system would ensure the reallocation of internal resources toward the weaker areas, while the adoption of common working laws; retirement, health-care, and unemployment regimes; education-system standards; official language, and governance would progressively increase the internal mobility of the workforce while promoting productivity convergence across the union.
Since the EU cannot become a federal state overnight, the situation calls for an immediate set of bold decisions. A common deposit insurance and banking-recapitalization scheme or the issuance of euro bonds would certainly help alleviate some of the immediate pressure on the European financial system but would not make the least-competitive countries effective again. As such, the long-term issues would remain unsolved, and recent events show how long-term risks increasingly tend to materialize into short-term crises at breakneck speed.
Europeans have to show more creative flexibility if they wish to maintain their union. Critically, they have to accept that a common currency does not necessarily imply exclusive legal-tender status across their entire economic area. There are historical examples of federations or empires that allowed several currencies to coexist on a more or less transitional basis, in order to adapt to local realities. The U.S. adopted its national currency as its sole legal tender only in 1857. Further back the Roman Empire let up to 350 local currencies thrive for three centuries in a status subordinate to the imperial money. Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, and Africa offer more recent examples of coexistence between a local cheaper currency and the German mark, the U.S. dollar, the euro, or the Russian ruble used as a more or less official anchor of value. Poland, Brazil, Kazakhstan, and Turkey do better today than Greece or Spain.
Then, true solidarity must develop between member states. The way Greek debt was restructured was the exact opposite of what should have been done. Its private holders, mostly European financial institutions, were bullied into a degree of losses that would be unbearable to the European banking system as a whole if applied to Portugal, Spain, and others in due course. Greece was then left under a still-too-heavy burden as European public institutions shielded themselves from sharing the losses. This is the very reason why the recent Spanish bank bailout failed to improve the peripheral countries’ capital markets: investors correctly assessed they had become holders of subordinated debt. Finally, the deflationary measures imposed on Greece now benefit local passive capital holders at the expense of private-sector workers and shareholders while threatening a 1930s Depression-type situation.
Greek future financing needs should have instead been channeled toward a European mechanism with an explicit joint credit guarantee. Existing debt would have been simultaneously purchased in the market and then swapped at a discount to its notional value, achieving a significant reduction of Greek debt, as public and private holders would have been treated on a similar footing. Since Greece now enjoys a primary surplus, Greek debt would have become sustainable, and the level of risk premium bearing on the other peripheral countries would have been mitigated. European states would have collectively accepted the sovereign risk of Greece, a first step toward a federal debt, budget, and government. The core European countries would have easily withstood any resulting losses, as the area’s consolidated external accounts are balanced, while reaping the political benefits of their European engagement. In contrast, the chosen process of selfish procrastination is a sure recipe toward a monetary-union disintegration and long-lasting animosity among European nations. In any case, disintegration would cost far more than voluntarily accepted losses.
Remarkably, it may not be too late. Appropriate decisions could buy much-needed breathing time for the EU, while a firm commitment toward effective political integration would be announced in order to address the fundamental shortcomings of the current monetary union. The overall credibility of the euro would increase, compounding in return the effectiveness of any shorter-term stabilizing measure. Nothing of that sort will occur without the support of the Europeans themselves. If one lesson has to be learned from the current failure, it is that a federal compact between democratic nations cannot afford the degree of democratic deficit that has plagued the European project for so many decades. This may call for a wide renewal of the often entrenched and ineffective European political leadership. In any case, the euro occupies a status by now so central to the preservation or destruction of the European Union that it has certainly surpassed the ambition of its most enthusiastic initial supporters.

It is not so much about "fairness" as it is about reverse racism, buying the vote, and a dose of good old fashioned envy.

Surprise, no mention of the basic problem:
"From each according to ability, to each according to need"
Creates political "arbiters of "fairness" reaping a hefty commission by pretending to arbritrade between "needs", which are ever escalating since, it is a motivational economic principle of life: You get what you encourage (sloth and "need") and punish what you discourage (productivity).

Thanks.
Pertinent question to the esteemed Dr. Machan: Why does anyone believe the socialist wealth redistribution/wealth equality line? Going through the whole sordid history of state socialism going back to Jan Mattys and Jan Bockelson's prototype socialist terror state in Munster in 1534-35 down through the Soviet Union, People's Republic of China, National Socialist Germany, Jonestown and beyond, when did socialist politicians ever redistribute the wealth they stole to anyone but themselves and their cronies beyond the minimum amount necessary to maintain power? Maybe in a few small Utopian communities like amongst the Shakers or Robert Owen's New Harmony, but on the level of state socialism? Even when allegedly spending their stolen wealth on the poor, a disproportionate amount goes for cushy high-paying jobs for armies of administrators while the poor are made poorer
If only, those people who demand "social justice" would understand that the only way to achieve this utopian goal is to impoverish everyone. Then universal equality is achieved as we all wait to die of starvation. (Even here, true equality remains elusive, as there will be those who can survive longer that others without food.)
The few references and examples provided are educational. But Obama so strongly believes his economic theory, that he does not wish to be bothered with "inconvenient truths." Sadly, there are many others who should know better but continue to seek the impossible utopian goals set by progressives.
Here in California, the land of fruits and nuts, our progressive legislature just missed a deadline to pass a "single payer" health care bill this year. (It passed in a previous session but was vetoed by Gov. Schwarzenegger.) It will likely be back agains next year -- and sadly, Gov. Moonbeam will likely sign it into law -- not that the progressives have any clue how to pay for it.
When I talk of these topics with some folks (who should know better) they just say, "Oh, things will work out... " That is the ultimate sadness -- these supposedly educated and intelligent folks who prefer to ignore the stark facts rather than stand up and protest.
Gov. Jerry has also lined up a series of propositions for the November ballot that will raise sales taxes and add a "millionaires'" tax to the state income tax -- a super category that "taxes the rich." The shocker is that the state that once hosted the "taxpayer revolt" and proposition 13, now polls strongly in favor of these new/increased taxes (even though most of the impact will hit the "middle class" with the sales tax).
Our Air Resources Board has decided that 14% of new automobiles must be "zero" emission vehicles by 2025 -- again with no understanding of how this will be acheived -- or how auto dealers will be able to induce someone looking for an SUV to buy an electric car. (Hint: the law is worded to "cap" non-electric car sales, so prices will rise to allow the market to clear naturally. So you can buy a $40,000 electric car you don't want -- or pay $50,000 for the SUV you do want.) The state will receive the benefit of the increased sales taxes collected through these artificially inflated prices.
As I search for another state to reside in, I'm struck by the implications that as California drives the productive private businesses and their employees to other states, that ultimately there will be nobody left here except (mostly unionized) government workers and recipients of the state's largess. Without any real (or sufficient) productive private industry, tax collections will collapse and those fat public worker retirement paychecks will no longer have any funds available to cash them. And the "poor" who get massive benefits from the state will also no longer receive that largess.
Then, the utopia of progressive policies will be achieved as those few fools who remain here will experience true social justice as they all starve in the midst of what was once one of the most productive areas in all the world.
Economic fairness is impossible: an oxymoron.
1948 to 1958 Germany , perhaps the only time in modern history , an economic fairness existed. By 1958 Germany was the richest country in the world (by population), reason being: economic Fairness. Labour and capital worked with open books.How quick we forget , or simply never knew.
Life Magazine : Special issue May 1954 and again 1958.
But in a free country, with the principle of private property rights as the law of the land, the king or government has no business engaging in wealth distribution so the issue of fairness is entirely moot.
So anyone born into a situation where ALL the Land is already owned and passed on from generation to generation within families is basically born into a caste system. This brings to mind those in India who kill and eat rats for a living; perhaps the lowest caste.
But who says we have to share the planet? Greed is good. Damned those who say we have enough for everyone's need but not for everyone's greed. Einstein and Issac Newton would disagree with your thoughts but hey I am sure Bernie Madoff would agree.
Thank You for the information.
As I follow these posts, I am struck by the absence of any mention of the credit default swap derivative products, primarily of JP Morgan, that lured the largest banks and financial institutions in the world to invest and, after a decade of profits, lose billions of dollars and euros, as the sub-prime mortgage scam opened a gash in the ship's hull reminiscent of the recent disaster in Italy. The institutional money spent on worthless financial products eventually drained capital out of each participating country's economy, making it even harder for governments to pay for the entitlements and services for which they were elected. "Blythe Masters" by Pierre Jovanovic is a superb book on the international consequences of the activities of JP Morgan, under the leadership of Mrs. Masters, whom Jovanovic calls the most powerful woman ever to walk the planet -- more powerful that Cleopatra or the Queen of England -- because she was able to bring whole nations to their knees. Jovanovic sees this as the primary cause of the global financial crisis. The book is in French and has been widely read in France. The DB, in my opinion, should have the resources to read it before it comes out in English. I eagerly await the DB's comments on it. It's the story of something that was just "too good to be true." Yet the sharp minds of multi-millionaire CEOs got suckered into putting lots of eggs into a basket whose bottom, common sense would have told them, was loosely attached.
Might be easier (less difficult) to just go get a different one, where all this garbage hasn't already taken place.
There is a reason, why the Anglosphere elite want a one world government, and that is, because, if they keep doing what they are doing, it will, in fact, be easier (less difficult) to simply leave and find a better place. But, it will have to be a place with enough natural resources, that the rest of the world cannot control it, by withholding whatever that place doesn't have.
We can go search for an uncharted continent right after we finish inventing our free energy source, so we can cloak it;)
Humans are born with hugely varying levels of abilities. The collectivist attitude is that none should be allowed to fail / die. ALL should be allowed to reproduce. We don't follow that practice for domestic animals. Nature doesn't follow that practice for wild animals.
Why should homo-sapiens be special? We can't claim that all humans should be nourished on moral grounds. That would rule out abortion. We can't claim that there is a shortage of man.
There isn't any possibility of economic fairness if there isn't any control of reproduction.

. Of course my new tech crush PicMonkey has a tasty one! Speaking of them.....
Here's How to Do it!
Decide does not specify a minimum size, but anything
smaller than 640 pixels wide will likely look pixilated. If
you want to play with reality by holding up an iPad or frame or line up
your Twitter icon in a special way, do use a Photoshop Template. There's
one available for download in the Mashable article listed below. The
only problem I have with it, it's too small. I like the resolution to be
a higher pixel rating but it's great to play with to get the feel of
where to line up the background images!
Speaking of zesty headers check out Mentor Mob! A great new curation tool as evidenced by the talented mind of one Dr. Joyce Valenza. I haven't had time to play with it myself, but I've seen it in action and it is SWEET!!
So...Of course I had to play with different concepts before settling on one header. Here is my most recent header and then a few other renditions.
I finally chose a background created with Go!Animate that had 2 different framed posters on the animation graphic already that I could utilize for my profile pic (which would be overlayed) and of course a QR code that when scanned brings ya right here!
Being a devoted cinephile, theatre buff, & pop culture ho - of course I gravitated towards the Cinema scene!
Here's how it looks LIVE! (Larger size) Or go check it out LIVE! Here are my first tries...
Twitter headers with my David Lanham cartoon trippy mirroresque,
Super Hero influences, QR Code (of course!), and as always a Steampunk version. Do you have a favourite?.

Detroit’s Diversity Supports A Growing Film Industry
Prayers For Bobby with Sigourney Weaver.
On January 24, 2009 at 9:00 PM, the eyes of Detroit turned to the Lifetime Television Network, searching for familiar places and faces in the background of the feature film Prayers For Bobby. Starring Sigourney Weaver, it drew 3.8 Million Viewers During Its national Premiere on Lifetime Television.
Prayers For Bobby portrays the tragic struggle of a gay teen in a conservative Christian family and the family’s attempt to “heal” him. For four years before his death, Bobby’s religious mother encouraged him to “cure” his homosexuality through prayer. Bobby Griffith’s four-year struggle with being gay and trying to live a Christian life ended on Aug. 27, 1983.
Several Detroit-area locations hosted the filming of Prayers for Bobby in the spring of 2008. It was one of the first productions to take advantage of a new tax-break program signed into effect by Governor Jennifer Granholm in April of 2008 aimed at luring filmmakers to the state.
The production brought together hundreds of men and women from the local gay community who volunteered as background extras. Affirmations, the Ferndale-based community center for gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgendered people and allies, played an important role in getting extras for the shoot, particularly on June 17, 2008 when over 200 people packed Washington Avenue in Royal Oak for a fictitious gay pride parade. They also hosted the area’s premiere viewing of the feature, packing the community room to capacity with over 100 excited viewers.
Deborah Holbrook of Ferndale took part in filming three scenes. She watched the giant projection screen carefully to see if her face made it into the delegation at the beginning of the parade, as a funeral attendee, and as one of the onlookers in the closing scene of the movie. “I can’t wait to show people how it turned out with everyone coming together” Holbrook said before the show. “The director and other people working were very patient with everyone. It was a fun experience.”
Though filmed under the overcast skies of Royal Oak, the Prayers for Bobby story takes place in San Francisco, CA. It is based on the life of Mary Griffith whose homophobic religious attitude and behaviors drove her gay son to suicide, and the changes within her heart that followed.
“It was great to see the local gay community coming together to welcome the film industry to Michigan,” said Affirmations Communications Manager Cass Varner. “We’re especially happy that one of the first big productions was one that brought so many important issues facing the LGBT community to the surface.”
Volunteer Aaron Watkins was given the opportunity to host an Affirmations information booth as part of the action of the pride parade scene. Though in the final cut none of the individual booths are distinguishable, the volunteers felt it was a worthwhile experience.
“It was weird,” Watkins said. “They had all the floats and signs and balloons like a real Pride parade. But instead of having everyone march down the street like a normal parade, they just had them go about ten feet. Then they’d say ‘cut’ and the whole thing would have to back up to the same place and go again. It was the same thing all day long. I’m lucky I got to be one of the ones sitting behind a booth and not out in the cold street moving back and forth twenty-some-odd times.”
For many this was their first Hollywood-like experience. But for Affirmations regular Esper French, Prayers for Bobby was a second brush with fame. Esper was in the final crowd scene for the 2002 feature film Super Sucker, which was filmed near Jackson, MI.
“I hope to get my SAG (Screen Actors Guild) card so I can be in more movies, but it’s expensive.” Esper said. “I’ve got a nice memory though. They gave us these little Pride flags and I took mine around and had a bunch of the other extras autograph it.”
Brandon Reeves of Royal Oak has some great memories too. “I was in a club scene that was in Royal Oak, and in a shot where I was walking down the street when the actor playing Bobby drives by. I got to meet Ryan Kelley, who played Bobby. He came right up and introduced himself, shook everyone’s hand.”
The only downside, well known to most film professionals, is the wait in between shots. “They held us a long time before they used us,” Reeves said. “It was about eight hours. It gave me a chance to make friends at least.”
Even I got in on the action and became a big fan of the process. I have landed three more movie gigs a result of volunteering. I only went because I wanted Affirmations to be represented in the movie (I am a member of the Affirmations Speakers Bureau). But once I got there I was hooked by the process. I never even thought of acting until I went to Prayers for Bobby. Just shows the value of putting yourself out there I guess. Hopefully I’ll get a glimpse of myself in other Detroit-area productions like High School and The Prince of the Motor City!

Wave to XWM
Skyrim modders and from what I found whilst googling this issue, other modders for other games are having problems converting their audio in to XWM file (also called the XWMA file format). Which is a variation on the WMA file format windows media player uses.
Several games use Xwma (or XWM for short) audio files, but all of them appear to be console games. PC at the time of writing has little or NO support for this format outside of the Microsoft Direct X SDK and even then the solution involves a Microsoft DOS command not a app or a proper shell command as you might expect in this age of Windows 7 and 64 bit computers and electricity.
Thankfully Doombuggie and Euther found out what was needed to make converting waves to XWMs a painless experience and I slapped together this document to help those suck in the same boat we were stuck in.
Thank you guys.
For copyright reasons I cannot share the required "xWMAEncode.exe" file with you directly, but I can tell you where to get it. Always remember to check for newer versions of these distributions. The bold type above the links is the name to search for. At the time of writing (March 2012), these are the current versions.
Requirements
Microsoft's Directx SDK
Directx SDK (June 2010)
The actual file you need from that 500meg download is the "xWMAEncode.exe" and it needs the Visual C++ Runtime Libraries to work, see the link below.
Microsofts Visual C++ Runtime Libraries
Visual C++ Runtime Libraries 32bit (Dec 2010)
Visual C++ Runtime Libraries 64bit (Dec 2010)
Download Wave2XWM archive
Download the Wave2XWM archive from us here at the guild. This contains the bat file you need, or you can create this file using the instructions found at the end of this doc.
Setting things up.
Install the Microsoft DirectX SDK and the correct Visual C++ Runtimes for your system, if you do not know which runtime is right for you. Go to My Computer (or just Computer on the Windows 7 start menu) and right click on it and select properties. You will get a window up giving information that should contain something about the OS you are using, be it 32 or 64 bit.
Open up the Wave2Xma archive and you will see a folder has been packed in to it containing the bat file you need, just drag this folder to where you want to convert your files. Or make a folder of your own and drag and drop just the bat file in to that.
Now Skip to the Usage instructions, and come back to this point if nothing happens.
If you follow the usage instructions below and nothing happens, you need to move the xWMAEncode.exe in to the same folder as the bat file we provided. Search for it using windows and copy it to the folder.
Any exe in the system path will work from any location under dos, but an exe outside of the system path has to be run from the folder its stored in or moved to the system path. Hence the reason for making a copy in the folder containing the bat file.
Usage
Just copy all your wave files to the folder and click on the bat file to run it, it will convert ALL the waves to xwm in seconds for you. Also note that xWMAEncode.exe command does a lot more than just converting waves, so if you read the docs for it you may be able to adapt this to support other formats used by other games.
What's in the bat file ?
Well this one line.
for /r . %%T IN (*.wav) do @xWMAEncode.exe "%%T" "%%~pT%%~nT.xwm"
To make it, copy that to an ordinary txt file, save it and then change the extension from txt to bat and you have a bat file. This only works on normal txt files btw.

The New York Times is aiming to cut 30 positions in order to shrink the size of its newsroom, citing financial challenges.
“These are financially challenging times,” said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman of the Times Company, in a statement, according to the newspaper. “While our digital subscription plan has been highly successful, the advertising climate remains volatile and we don’t see this changing in the near future.”
Jill Abramson, executive editor at the Times, said that she is looking for 30 managers who are not union members to take buyout packages.
If not enough people take buyout packages; Abramson said that she “will be forced to go to layoffs among the excluded staff.”
Currently, the Times has around 1,150 newsroom employees. In recent years, the company has been hit hard due to an industry downturn in newspaper advertising.
The latest earnings report shows that print advertising in the Times, The Boston Globe, and The International Herald Tribune has declined by around 10.9 percent. Digital advertising also fell by 2.2 percent.

Entourage Recap (Season 8, Episode 3): One Last Shot
This week on Entourage; Vince negotiates with a former enemy, ‘Johnny’s Bananas’ is falling apart before it even airs and Ari goes on a date.
‘One Last Shot’ opens the same way that the season did, with Vince in front of a podium. He’s spouting the usual Narcotics Anonymous platitudes, which while contrite, I’d imagine are an integral feature of the program. Also attending the meeting is Paul Ertz, the sleezy producer (and apparent coke head, to no one’s surprise) who manipulated Vince into a bait-and-switch with the unfortunately named “Danger Beach” in the wake of the ‘Medellin’ fallout a few seasons ago. He’s interested in making Vince’s miner movie, and his proposal is not immediately jettisoned because of the delicate circumstances. There’s a social contract type deal about tip toeing around recovering addicts. Never one for niceties, when the issue’s brought to Ari’s attention, he handles it with the level of sensitivity longtime that won’t surprise regular viewers.
On similar note, I was glad to see Ari and Vince interacting again, since the two have a relatively entertaining dynamic. After they’re done referencing Vince’s inadvisable career moves, Lloyd and Vince start pressuring Ari to “get out more”. The two trading quips about their relative talents for pickup artistry may have been the episode’s high point for me; the writers’ eye for male banter is perhaps the show’s defining quality, and season 8’s first two episodes were unimpressive in that department. After a minute or two of this, it’s agreed that Ari will be going on a date with Lloyd’s hairdresser’s niece, which is quite the situation. It’s not a side of Ari we’ve ever seen before, and I’m always down for narrative progress.
The date itself, by the way, is hilarious. The girl appears to be about half his age, and acts even younger than that. At the restaurant, she claims to have never been on a dinner date before (seriously?), indicating that her “dates” usually skip that particular step, If You Know What She Means. She then suggests they do shots to “loosen [him] up”. There’s a pretty funny sequence at her apartment where her metalhead roommate (or maybe raver, I’m awful at identifying subcultures) haggles with her over condoms. Knowing what you (probably) know about Ari Gold, try to imagine him in that situation. The storyline concludes with Ari having wiggled his way out of that particular entanglement, waking up next to Dana Gordon. When he called her, she agreed to have “just one drink”, and you know what that means. Good for them. If you ask me, the two have tons of chemistry.
There’s also a good bit of focus on the ‘Johnny’s Bananas’ storyline, which is following the formulaic structure usually reserved for Vince’s film projects; it seems like a great opportunity, but complications inevitably arise. In this case, it’s Johnny’s vociferously obstinate co-star, Andrew “Dice” Clay. The man is a walking narrative conflict motivator, refusing to cooperate with anyone about anything, even suggesting that Johnny join in his ill-advised civil disobedience. His bizarre insistence that he get his contract renegotiated before a single episode of the cartoon airs is so outlandish that even the famously melodramatic Johnny wants him to pump the breaks. It goes without saying that Dice’s replacement sucks. To quote Billy “He sucks. The show sucks. I hate everyone.” Welcome back the business, Drama.
The remainder of the episode is focused on Vince and Turtle, who have made plans to open a restaurant. Turtle’s been retired from Avion, the tequila company he and Vince helped get off the ground last season, and is desperate for a new business opportunity. After liquidating their stock in the company, the two endeavor to open said restaurant, but not before visiting Paul Ertz, who claims to have struck a deal for Vince with CBS. The guy greets them in his dressing gown, obviously coked out of his mind, and plays the meeting like a strung-out used car salesman. Vince is extraordinarily empathetic, pulling out his considerable social graces to try to calm the guy down, who promptly starts doing lines of cocaine in his bathroom. Hollywood, I guess. Anyway, Paul Ertz is apparently the kind of guy to keep a handgun in his bathroom (I mean, what?), and picks this particular moment to commit suicide, which is insane and jarring. It literally came out of nowhere, one of those things that’s inherently Not Funny, but kind of makes you laugh because of its abruptness and general strange context. Before anyone can react, credits roll.

A warm sweater for when they are living on the streets?
If you come up with a better idea, I'm looking for one for my brother ;-)
Preface:
So every family or circle of friends has got one. An absolute bum that hasn't worked in years. Who's unemployment has run out, and they replaced that source of income by latching onto and/or marrying someone to carry them. They spend each week basically laying on the couch, and Facebooking about how depressed they are -- and how they didn't sign up for this sad, sad life. They're in their mid 30's and life has just passed them by. Meanwhile they haven't made any attempt to better themself, haven't even tried to go to college or learn a trade, and just expects the world to be handed to them on a silver platter. Entitlement anyone?
Question:
If you were obligated to get this person a gift, what gift would it be? I see myself giving them a book on how to get a job, or how to write a resume -- which I know will come across pretty backhanded, but sheesh... Wake up and smell the coffee already! haha Your thoughts?

1. A Xanax prescription.
2. 1st year: Tiny fridge built to be an end table (so they don't have to walk all the way to the kitchen for a beer)
3. Next year, you can give them a matching end table w/microwave.
4. Third year: See below

I was thinking of giving them MJ's book, but this person has never finished a book in their life -- So I think that would be an absolute waste.
haha -- Although your suggestion seems spot on Russ, I'd hate to give them anything that would encourage them to continue living in this lifestyle that I don't endorse

Get him some new underwear...
Everyone else keeps telling them to get off their butt and get a job.
And here you would be, saying, "Yo, bro, hat's off to you! Work is so overrated, and being productive? Pfa!"
Get it?
They'd be the first gifts that he'd enjoy (if he's truly a bum), or hate (if he actually doesn't acknowledge his bum-ness).
Word of advice: NEVER do this for an in-law. It's against the rules, if you plan on staying married. Must be a blood relative.

Give them the gift of self awareness, give them MJ's book. I finally got mine, finished reading it and it was great. Kinda disappointed though, out of all the people on these forums that bought it theres only 11 comments/rating on amazon wth? at least they all gave it 5 stars, not that it deserves anything less.
"I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon But I'm to busy gazing at stars" -Eminem - Not Afraid
I have an idea for you. Give him MJ's book but put a $20 bill in the middle of it. It might be worth it just to see if he is so lazy that he wont even open the book. If he doesnt it would be great verbal ammo for you at some later point.
What about an application to the local McDonald's? lol That's the best I can come up with at the moment. PS: Great Topic
"A closed mind is a stagnant pond" - Me
How about a mentoring coupon? Try and help him get motivated in doing something. The cold season is coming; maybe he can start to get ready to have a small business shoveling sidewalks? Maybe you can help him build a website. If you can get him to do something to make him feel better about himself that might be enough to push him through these depressing times.
I guess I would think about the purpose of this "gift" (if you can call it a gift; sounds like a jab at this point).
Best regards.
My question is, why do you feel obligated to get them anything?
I realize that Christmas is the time for giving but it should not be because of an obligation. Give him/her your love and acceptance for who they are, not who you think they should be.
I do like Russ' suggestion though.

I once gave one of my sisters "how to win friends and influence people".
This sister had/has the most negative attitude about life and is truly painful to spend time with.
She opened the package, took one look at the book then threw it at me and walked out the door.
Apparently she wasn't interested in learning the lessons.

And clearly, she knew how to influence people-- just not in a positive way.
Isn't it amazing how people make their own misery?
They whine and moan about how tough they have it. And they do their level best to shun anything that could help them get out of their ruts.
Not for me, nope. Not for me.

Spain’s most indebted region Catalonia said on Tuesday that it needed €5 billion (£3.97 billion) emergency financial aid from a central government rescue fund as it struggles to pay for basic services such as hospitals, schools and care homes.
With Catalonia’s debt crisis worth €42 billion (£33 billion), Spain’s efforts to avoid a full bailout has been dented. Catalonia is one among the six regional governments that has turned inoperative on capital markets and needing government assistance to roll over debt and fund budget deficits.
The Catalan government has already cut public-sector wages, introduced a €1 (£0.79) charge for each medical prescription and frozen infrastructure investments as it seeks to bring its public deficit under control. Catalonia’s debt is equivalent to 21% of the region’s gross domestic product.
The Spanish government set up a fund worth €18 billion (£14 billion) to help regional governments deal with financial crunch. Valencia and Murcia regions have already approached the central government seeking financial aid.
The request for financial bailout came as private deposits at Spanish banks dropped at the quickest pace since the launch of the euro and data confirmed the Spanish economy shrank for the third consecutive quarter between April and June.
Francesco Homs, spokesman for the regional government, said that Catalonia would not accept additional political conditions over budgetary measures that have already been agreed upon with Madrid “because the money is Catalan money”. This attitude of the region risks fostering further tension with Spain’s central government after Catalonia boycotted a meeting to set regional budgets in late July.

Myanmar Fish Farms Suffer as Hot Weather Continues07 March 2013
MYANMAR - Fish farms in Myanmar are suffering due to unusual hot weather and parasites for this time of year. The hot weather has caused many pond to dry up and has reduced oxygen levels in the water.
While fish farmers normally wait to harvest their fish until monsoon season from June until October, they are harvesting their fish now in fear that they will die from the heat or parasites, reports the MyanmarTimes.
The most common parasite affecting fish farms is dactylogyrus, a flatworm known to inhabit fish gills, the Myanmar Fish Farmer Association said.
The parasite is temperature dependent: Hotter water temperatures increase the parasite’s life cycle from only a few days to five or six months. Anti-parasitic medicine can be bought from China or Thailand and costs about K250,000 (about US$290).
“Fish farmers who did not use medicine for parasites face higher losses. I used the medicine after suffering about K300,000 (about US$350) in losses when my fish died,” U Soe Tint, the Association’s vice chairman, told The Myanmar Times.
U Than Lwin, chairman of the Association, said that throughout his 10 fish pools, each comprising 10 acres, four or five fish will die in a pool on a hot day.
“I want to advise fish farmers that if fish are dying in their pools, they should take a sample of one fish to a laboratory and have it tested at Thaketa township in Yangon. The results of the test will give evidence as to what kind of parasite has infected the fish and will indicate what medicine to use,” he told the newspaper.
U Than Lwin said that this is common in April and May as the heat rises, but an uncommon phenomenon to occur as early as February and March. It is likely to be due to climate change.
“Fish farmers can plant trees around their pools to help provide shade and oxygen, and must give their fish medicine in time,” he said.

Woman Security office. The security guard said that Gilbert’s tshirt, which named an educational and resource Web site for gay women, was offensive.
“As an African-American and a lesbian, I haven’t been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking,” said Gilbert.
She said the guard, who works for a private company hired by the Department of Homeland Security, demanded that she leave the building or face arrest.
After being kicked out of the federal building, Gilbert called her mother, Tanya Gilbert, a longtime activist for gay rights.
When Tanya Gilbert arrived on the scene she called the Los Angeles Police Department to protest her daughter’s removal. But before four Los Angeles police officers and one federal agent arrived, Lapriss was told she could come back into the building.
Paul Dumont saw the incident and made a statement to the police, in which he said the guard’s “loud, unreasonable, aggressive and angry approach to the situation almost caused chaos.”
“For her to be told to leave was completely unnecessary, especially considering how peaceful and quiet she was responding the security officers,” said Dumont. “Nobody in that office felt her T-shirt was offensive by any means.”.”

As a British Expat who recently became a USA National, I can visualise this sort of bum fluff completely. The security guards at the SSA and DHS are usually jobsworths and a bit trigger-happy, so to hear they treated a woman in this way is completely outragous. The SSA is generally a bit shit... truth be told... and the whole system needs a good overhaul. Including their security guard hiring process, apparently.

I'm not so sure this is an instance of homophobia as much as an instance of over-strict 'good taste'. Would that guard, for example, have removed somebody with a t-shirt saying "sex.com" or "heterosexuals.com"? Perhaps the guard was just a prude who would have thrown out somebody wearing a rape-prevention t-shirt?
Wrong? Yes. Bigoted? Maybe not.
Qubit // Posted 27 August 2008 at 15:39
My instinct would be that this is to do with the fact that there is a common hetro male fantasy for lesbians therefore the t-shirt would be consider titillation and too explicit. This doesn't make it any less prejudice. I would imagine wearing such a t-shirt out would lead to a lot of abuse but I could be wrong. Ari W might also be right that it would happen to any website with such a name. I think their is an assumption with words such as lesbian, gay and heterosexual/straight is that since they describe a sexuality anything containing them must be about sex.
Jess // Posted 27 August 2008 at 16:42
But Ari W - I think that's a very weird set of comparisons. A t-shirt which read "sex.com" would, you presume, be a porn site. If I saw a t-shirt that read "heterosexuals.com", I think it'd probably assume it was advertising some kind of dodgy homophobic site. Not that I'd exactly advocate for anyone being thrown out of a building for wearing a t-shirt (unless it had a swastika on it, or something), but the reasons that someone might object to the t-shirt ideas you mention would be very different.
Sorry, but I just think this is a case of obvious and blatent homophobic discrimination.

Hey y'all,
just wanted to point out that 'lesbian' does not refer to a sexual act. It refers to a political and personal form of identification.
She was not wearing a 'heterosexuals.com' t-shirt, nor was she wearing a 'sex.com' t-shirt. Therefore to say that the discrimination she experienced was only to do with a lack of good taste (and I happen to think lesbians taste great, in any case) rather than her orientation is a completely untestable and fallacious argument.
What I find most interesting about this is the security company they're using - despite the government owning the building, they are refusing to take any responsibility for this behaviour - and you can be damn sure that Paragon aren't going to care (see all those horrible cases of assault, rape etc in privately contracted security companies working for the US government - all they get are more contracts).
Anne Onne // Posted 27 August 2008 at 18:58
I guess the argument, assuming that sexuality really did play no part in this, is to what extent should another's taste dictate what someone can and can't wear? Why should someone be ejected from the building because a security guard is offended by their attire, which is neither indecent (ie they are not naked or flashing), nor insulting in terms of the language? Where does the realm of taboo end and that of taste begin? One may find a slogan tasteless, or not get it, or find it problematic, but that is entirely different to acting as if it is a personal slight.
But I don't buy that homophobia plays no part in this, simply because it's impossible to separate the offense that could be taken from the word 'lesbian' from the offense at homosexuality, ie homophobia.
The word itself is not a swearword, and no case can be made that it is itself offensive without implying that homosexuality is offensive, and that therefore the feelings of homophobes must be spared from viewing the t-shirt.
Were it a string of swear words, the reaction would be more understandable (if still far too heavy-handed), because many people, for all sorts of reasons, take offense at swear words, and the context of their use can matter greatly.
They are starred out and treated as taboo, and we can analyse the whys and wherefores, but they are luckily in a different class to the word 'lesbian'. The fact that to some people 'lesbian' is as good as a gross insult is rather telling.
Besides, I still think that the issue should stand, even if the T-shirt bears a slogan that I would consider offensive, like one of those awful rape joke/objectifying/generally misogynist t-shirts, I would not think it right to forcibly remove someone from the building for wearing one. Looking away in horror is one thing, expecting anyone with offending garments to be frogmarched off to the police station is another.
Standards of offense differ considerably, and I'd think it would have to be a pretty extreme example to warrant such action. In the end, unless there is a specific uniform for employees, people should be allowed to wear what they wish.
And ironically, we don't get lots of reports of frat boys with rude t-shirts and women with 'playboy bunny' or other lurid slogans sprawled accross their chests getting kicked out.
Qubit // Posted 28 August 2008 at 16:36
I think the point I was trying to make is that (wrongly) the majority of people when seeing a t-shirt for lesbian.com would make the assumption it was probably a porn site. I can see but disagree with the argument of asking someone to leave or cover up for wearing an advert to an explicit site.
The fact that there is the assumption that such a site will be porn or for sexual titillation is obviously a bad sign and something that should be tackled BUT I think it is there.
Joan // Posted 21 October 2008 at 22:57
We can only hope the guard loses his job and instructions are left in his employment file to advise prospective future employers that may ring to check his work history that this individual is violently discrimatory and should under no circumstances be given employment.

Nardwuar: Hello?
Gauntlet: Hi, can I speak to Nardwuar please?
N: This is him.
G: Hi Nardwuar, this is Peter calling from the University of Calgary Gauntlet.
N: How're you doing?
G: I'm doing quite well, how are you doing?
N: Good. Thanks for the interest.
G: No problem at all. Do you mind if I ask where you are right now, just for context?
N: I'm at my house in Vancouver, BC, Canada.
G: Doing anything special for Mother's Day today? I've heard that you're still living with your mother?
N: I'm taking my mom out for lunch, and going to get her some Harley Davidson Biker Brew Coffee that she really enjoys.
G: Harley Davidson Biker Brew Coffee. I've never heard of that, I didn't realize that Harley was into the coffee industry.
N: Yes, they're into that. It's everywhere, eh? Just like Yamaha in the old '80s used to be into everything.
G: Seems kind of odd. Anyway, the first thing I wanted to ask you about is a quote from Scratch Records that said that the Evaporators were Canada's "indisputable best live band" and that "Nardwuar is one of the best things about Canada. Is it actually indisputable, that the Evaporators are the best live band in Canada?
N: That's very nice of them to say that. Keith from Scratch records is a very nice guy, and the Evaporators have played with some of his bands over the years, so perhaps that's his firsthand knowledge. Or it's Shawn, the other guy from Scratch's knowledge as well. Shawn and Keith are also great fans of the other guys in our band. John Collins, who plays bass and is also in the New Pornographers, Dave Carswell you plays guitar and also plays in the Smugglers, because John and Dave played in a couple of tours with Superconducter, I don't know if you remember them at all. But they were Keith of Scratch records and Shawn of Scratch Records' band. So John and Dave filled in a few times. Because Superconductor were an amazing band. Also in the band was Carl, he was the singer, and Carl is now the singer of the New Pornographers, and John is in the New Pornographers. But John and Dave did a couple of tours of duty there with Superconductor, so Keith and Shawn are big fans I know at least of those guys, because they really kick it up a notch live, and they've seen that firsthand.
G: As a contrast to that, I'm sure you're familiar with Chart Magazine?
N: Yea… help me out a bit.
G: Chart magazine – the Canadian music magazine – they do annual reviews of the Canadian Music Week on their website chartattack.com. The actual quote from the review they have this time: "Nardwuar has balls the size of Nunavut, gumption to last three lifetimes and more talent than most cities. Unfortunately, the Evaporators just aren't very good... NO one cares about anyone else in the band."
N: The weird thing about that particular view, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but unfortunately the gentleman – I didn't actually find this out, Grant of the Smugglers found this out, because the Smugglers were reviewed as well – the gig that you're talking about started at 8pm, and ended at 2am, and the guy that reviewed the entire gig was there the entire night, and he later admitted to Grant of the Smugglers that he was exhausted, and just wanted to get the hell out of there. He was a big fan of a band, Death from Above, that played on that bill as well. Also on that bill were the Candidates, the High Dials, the Evaporators, the Smugglers, Death from Above. We were actually on at 1am, and believe it or not, we didn't get off stage until probably 2am. So the reviewer guy I guess unfortunately was completely wiped out, so I don't really know what would have saved him. One interesting thing about that is, he's entitled to his own opinion, is that we pulled up on stage with us Canadian heavy metal legend Thor, and Thor joined us for a couple of numbers. Unfortunately in his review, he didn't even mention that, which is kind of bizarre, since the Thor thing went out of control and haywire, for about 45 minutes. It was only supposed to be for 15 minutes, and it ended up being 45. So I'm not totally satisfied with that review in the sense that, you know it's his own opinion, but at least slag us by mentioning we had Canadian heavy metal legend Thor on stage. You don't have to try to watch the entire show, and he later talked to Grant from the Smugglers. I mean, I don't care, but Grant from the Smugglers, they got a weird review too, so Grant followed up on the guy. I just attributed it to somebody being totally tired. I mean, you're the last band on at 1am, the gig starts at 8pm, people were totally drunk. I don't know what the hell you can do. Grant of the Smugglers said that we were headlining the night, like he said "Man, you're headlining," because they went on right before us, and I said, "No Grant, we're playing clean up," you know, cleaning up the evening. So I'm not sure what anyone could have done in that situation with that reviewer. I mean, that guy's high point was several hours earlier when Death from Above played, so I don't know how anyone was going to top that.
G: And with Thor coming on, he did the whole blowing up the hot air balloon, bending steel in his mouth, that sort of thing, right?
N: Indeed. You sure have been digging around.
G: Well, you do it for your interviews, the least I could do is pay the same respect.
N: Yea, that's very nice of you, it's cool that you dug around and found those interesting tidbits. I love tidbits like that. But yes, we pulled Thor up on stage. I respect that guy's review, if he wants to say that, that's fine. And I hate to criticize someone's review, but I would say this, that he didn't seem to review the entire show because he didn't mention the Thor thing .That's all that sticks out in my mind, because the Thor thing as I said kind of went haywire, because people were drunk and grabbing him. What took 15 minutes to do in Vancouver, we did it with him once in Vancouver, took like 45 to an hour in Toronto. Our set was about half an hour as well, so it just was pretty crazy. But not including that, I don't know if you can totally take that without a grain of salt, you know?
G: Recently, the band Phantom Planet had their drummer Jason Schwartzman, who also is in movies, leave because he felt his fame was overshadowing the band's music. Do you ever get the impression that now that this MuchMusic thing has really been catching on, now that you're on Much On Demand all the time, that people are coming to the Evaporators show more to see Nardwuar than to see a good punk show?
N: Any way to get the kids out, I'll be happy. The only weird thing about it is that, sometimes I'll have a kid say "I didn't realize you had a band," and I'll say, "Yea, we actually started on February 20th, 1986," and then somebody will say, "Wow, I wasn't born until 1989." So it's kind of weird when that happens. Any chance that anybody comes to the gig, I'm totally happy. Any of the records that I've put out on Nardwuar the Human Serviette records – and this latest one is a Nardwuar slash Mint release in Canada, and it's on Alternative Tentacles, Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedy's label in the United States of America – all the records have included little tidbits of interviews, so it's all been intertwined. So I'm happy if somebody comes just because they've seen me on MuchMusic, or they've heard me on CITR Radio, and I'm happy if somebody shows up because they've heard the music and know nothing about the interviews because I think it's all one giant thing. The first record I put out in 1989 had interviews on it, like interviews with Jello Biafra, as well with ex-President of the United States Gerald Ford, so it isn't just rockers, it's politicians. It's all just one giant jumble. I love it.
G: So you don't really see a separation between the two?
N: Not at all, because I include both in the presentation of our music, because its fun to offer something extra. When you buy an album, it's fun to have liner notes, its fun to have little interview snippets to be able to listen to as well. It's the entire package. Some people say its all about the music, and I say yea, it's a bout the music, but it's also about the packaging. I love packaging too.
G: If it wasn't for the packaging, you'd see a lot more people downloading music. That's one of the main arguments I've heard from my friends is that you only get the music, none of the packaging, liner notes, everything you're talking about.
N: The pathetic thing about that though, I don't think it holds too much weight because the packaging is so pathetic, that once they get it, they're like "What the fuck? There's nothing there!" You can go to Amazon.com and print off the cover, and get the credits from All Music Guide, and make your own packaging a hell of a lot better than a lot of the bands. So yes, for a lot of the bands that have really cool packaging, I think you can't really download it, but for the others, I don't think it makes any difference because people don't put any effort into it.
G: You were talking about Jello Biafra before. He was in a movie in 1999 called the Widower, which I hear you had a cameo in?
N: Yes, I played a donut boy.
G: Your name isn't mentioned on their website, or on the IMDB reference to the movie. Are they trying to hide you?
N: I don't think I had any lines. I was just in the background, although I do know that "Doot-doo-da-loot-doo" I think was dubbed in. There is actually a picture of me somewhere on my website of me as Carl the Donut boy. If you go to the Nard Gallery on my website Nardwuar.com, and there's a little search thing in Nard Gallery, type in "The Widower" or "Carl the Donut Boy" and I think that'll come up, so there is proof floating around.
G: Would you ever consider doing another movie, or is that just sort of a one-off, cameo appearance?
N: I was in that movie "A Girl is a Girl," put together by Reg Harkema who helped edit Hard Core Logo, and that was another cameo in a record store. And actually the Evaporators song "I'm Going To France" played during the sex scene, when a guy's cock was exposed, so I thought that was quite an honour.
G: I was going through the Nard Gallery, and saw a picture of you and Jello Biafra with three albums. One of them was Mae West's Wild Christmas, but I couldn't make out what the other two were, or whether he was giving them to you or just showing them off.
N: He was just showing them to us. To tell you the truth, I don't remember what the albums actually were, because I didn't get a chance to write them down. We were at his house, and he just had them floating around there. The Mae West record was an obscure record that he had got in Australia and was really really rare. But it was really neat, because we got to stay at his house and he showed us lots of his records, and I did an interview with him that you can actually listen to the most recent interview that I did with him at Nardwuar.com. And he actually put out our record, which is pretty incredible considering that in 1989, when I put him on our record, it was a compilation record I put out called "Oh God, My Mom's on Channel 10," I thought that he hated me. And he did probably hate me. But after 15 years of bugging him, we ended up on his record label, so don't give up kids. You never know what will happen.
G: That's the moral of the story here?
N: Things have come around and now he's a good friend. He puts out our records and still gives me interviews.
G: It seems like you have that kind of effect on people. A lot of them seem to dislike you initially, and then you grow on them with your persistence. Is that something that you find happens a lot, like with Courtney Love, with Chris from Sloan, and apparantly with Jello Biafra from the Dead Kennedys? Why do you think that people have that initial "I don't know what to make of him, I don't like him all that much" reaction to you?
N: I don't know. I mean, if I knew that much about myself, then I don't know if I'd be here right now because I'd probably be winning the lottery. I just act like myself. The only thing I can think of is that I do my radio show every week at CITR, the University of BC, and again you can hear clips at Nardwuar.com of my shows over the years, and having to do a show every week, you have to come up with something every week. So if someone comes back to town, you think "oh I might as well try to talk to them again. So if it doesn't work once, well maybe try again. I interviewed Henry Rollins before, and I thought the interview went pretty fun, I don't think he liked it. When the interview was over, he was like "You need to get fucked. When's the last time you were fucked?" Unfortunately, none of that got on tape. But he still said that "next time you talk to me, make sure you floss and brush your teeth, because your breath is really really intense." So the way he said "the next time," I thought that's an invitation. So he's come back to town a couple of times, and I emailed him, because he does answer his email, just go to his website or whatever, and you can hook up, that 2-13-61 website and you can hook up with him that way indirectly through his publicist, but he's always emailed back with "No. Your act is pathetic. Leave me alone, I don't want to be interviewed by you." And another time he said, "Ian MacKaye of Fugazi played me some interviews you've done. Some of that was good shit, but your act is tired and I don't want to talk to you. Please don't bug me again." Every couple years he'll tell me that when I ask him for an interview. So it doesn't always work. Some people I've been able to bug over and over, and somehow been able to win them over and get lots of good interviews out of them, and we've become good friends. But with Henry Rollins, I still want to be his friend, as Chixdiggit say, but unfortunately nothing has really come as a result. However, indirectly, he did inspire the song Salad Bar on the Evaporators' new record, because the song Salad Bar is inspired from his book Get In The Van, where he talks about when Black Flag are on tour and they're really really hungry, he can feed the whole band by going to a salad bar. And they don't just buy a plate – well, they buy a plate, and put the plate on a tray, and they use the tray basically as the plate, and then everyone eats of the tray, so they only have to buy one plate, and they just put it on a tray and it's a giant mound. So that's what the song Salad Bar is about, on the Evaporators record.
G: On the new one, Ripple Rock.
N: On the new one, Ripple Rock. And, if you want to see how I've related to Jello Biafra over the years, you can just pop the Evaporators CD into your computer, it's an enhanced CD, and you can watch 14 or 12 years of me talking to Jello Biafra between 1989 and 2002. It has all the video clips all included there. You can also check that out at Nardwuar.com, but it is on the CD too as an enhanced feature, which I just think is awesome, because you get videos as well. So that's an added little feature with the packaging.
G: You were saying that Henry Rollins was saying your "act" was tired. Do you think of it as an act?
N: I just go out and go for it. I just get excited, and sometimes my voice goes up a bit because I'm excited. It's like Henry Rollins. This is a guy that's had beer bottles thrown at his head and it hasn't bugged him at all, so who knows what he's going to do to me. So I just get excited, and I just go for it. I think some people just don't understand, you become a super faN: boy in front of these people. I mean, what else can you be but nervous?
G: You do have a considerable amount of knowledge about the music scene, you've done a lot in terms of documenting the musicians that have come through Vancouver. You try to bring awareness of older Vancouver bands. Do you feel that you're a little bit underrated, for lack of a better word? Do you ever wish that you could be more respected in the journalism community?
N: I do feel that I'm respected, because I've been able to do a show on CITR UBC Radio since October 1987, touch wood. I've been on the air continuously since then, so I think that certain people in the community have given me a chance, so I'm forever grateful for them for letting me do my show every Friday since October 1987. I figure if I was doing it wrong, they would have yanked me by now. But I think I'm just totally honored that I'm able to go there and just do whatever the hell I want, whether it be interviewing a porn star, a politician, a band, a conspiracy theorist guy, it's just great to be able to keep on going. I would however one day like to get my own TV show, that is a goal of my own. To be able to have my own show where the Evaporators play, and I come running out and sing the theme song, and sit behind a desk and interview 50 Cent or whatever, or go on remote and interview 50 Cent or Brian Wilson. That would be my goal. I do have that goal, I'd love to do that.
G: Speaking of TV theme songs, the theme for Nard Wars is also "Nard Nest" off the newest album, is that right?
N: Yes it is. Thank you for noticing that, that is amazing, and like I say, thanks for digging around for all that information. This is just amazing that you actually know all this stuff. I'm just totally blown away.
G: I appreciate that. It just seems like the least I could do considering the effort you put into interviews with other artists. The question I was going to ask, though, is about the Nard Nest itself. [The Nard Nest is Nardwuar's message board on his web site,.] You seem to have a lot more contact with your fans than most artists I can think of. Do you think it's important to keep that close of a tie with your fans?
N: The Nard Nest is pretty easy to respond to because there aren't a hell of a lot of posts. It was kept alive by basically two people, Fergo Overdrive and Zooey Katooie. These two girls, they posted amongst each other like 900 posts each, just back and forth, using it as their own personal message board. So when someone else posts, I feel that I should go out there and try to respond to it. Plus I love doing it, I love seeing what people want to know and little tidbits of information. There's hardly any posts, really, and that's why we wrote the song Nard Nest. If you listen to the refrain, its "There's four people online, all the time" and we don't even basically get that. I think the most we've ever had at one time was when there were eleven people on in 2002, and I don't know how that happened. I think some of that was like cookies, searching out the site. It has that thing on the bottom of the message board of how many people maximum have been on the site, and its really not a hell of a lot. But its fun responding to people, and also trying to get information from people. People help me out by giving me suggestions of things to ask people when I'm doing interviews, etc, etc.
G: It looked like that came up for the Blur interview, although unfortunately it didn't look like you got to use too many of the questions before your hat was stolen.
N: I did actually get to use them. I'm not sure if the entire interview is posted there –
G: I think it was just the clip that aired on MuchMusic.
N: What actually happened there was I showed up and Dave, the drummer, didn't seem to be too pleased with me, and as soon as I walked the room, he just started roughing me up. Ripped up my questions that I was going to ask him, threw away my hat and my glasses, and for all intents and purposes just stormed off. And I was like "Ok", and just continued on the interview with Damon and Alex, and it went totally normal, and I asked him pretty much all the questions. It was just weird how that happened. I think other people, if they had that happen, would've just fucked off and been like "Hey, I'm out of here, I'm not going to do this interview." But for me it was just like, hey, this is just a drummer, I don't want to really speak to him anyway. I wanted to talk to Damon and Alex, and when I talked to them they were totally normal. It was just bizarre. I had spoken to them before, and the interview went just fine, you can actually read that interview at Nardwuar.com, if you want to check that out. So I don't know why the guy would be angry this time.
G: It's not the first time you've had stuff stolen from you though, right? There was the Sebastian Bach incident, and also at one show, apparently a couple of kids came up to you and one of them stole your hat? And you and Chris Murphy from Sloan had to tackle them and ransom it off?
N: Its pretty amazing isn't it, that a guy who I interviewed in 1991, Chris from Sloan, who stormed out of the interview, ten or twelve years later ends up getting back my hat that was stolen, that he lets us stay at his house when we play in Toronto with the Evaporators, and when I had my first ever MuchMusic special, Chris was the host of it. It's just incredible that all this happened. He's just a lifesaver. I mean, that was just amazing that he was able to do that. I'm just so in debt to him for doing that. This was a guy that really didn't like me, and then all these years later he's my friend. And he's still turning me on to stuff. I mean, when we're at his house, he exposed me to the movie Office Space, which I enjoy. And also the drumming of Buddy Rich, so that was pretty cool because I never would've gotten into those things otherwise, so thank you Chris Murphy.
G: If you like Office Space, there's another movie you should look into called Haiku Tunnel, I'm not sure if you would've heard of it. It's another sort of office comedy, and it's a little bit off beat.
N: Do you play in a band yourself?
G: Not at the moment. A few high school things, and a few local bands that went nowhere and didn't play any shows. Just more of a fan of music and movies in general.
N: Had you ever heard of the Evaporators before, because we had played Calgary a few times over the years.
G: The Evaporators I'd heard of but never really checked out outside of the one or two videos on the website, which to be honest I wasn't so much into. But having heard Ripple Rock it seems like a huge leap forward in terms of songwriting, I've actually liked it quite a bit more. But I haven't actually seen you guys live before, if that's what you're wondering.
N: Yea, just curious, because we have actually played Calgary over the years a few times, including Alberta, going back a few years to the Highwood Music Festivals. Those were in '93 and '92, these giant festivals that they had with bands like the Muffs and Mudhoney and Social Distortion play, and I remember we played one year and our check bounced, so that was pretty funny.
G: So they couldn't actually pay you for it then?
N: No, not the second year. It was great exposure though. It was pretty funny too because there were bands playing at all hours of the day. There was a band Bum, who I love, from Victoria, and they played at like 8 am. They woke up out of their tent and crawled over to the stage and played, and actually there were quite a few people there to see them. Not as many as, you know, bands that played in the afternoon.
G: Not a lot of that crowd is too big on the morning shows. Now, you were given a Piss Troll, is that correct?
N: Yes I was. Oh my God.
G: Do you still have that?
N: Yes I do. It's right beside me. It was given to me by this girl Sarah, she didn't tell me if there was piss in it or not. She just said "it's a piss troll. Deal with it." I tend to believe her though, because her friend Jones, that's how I met her, is friends with this guy called Senor Amore, who is a friend of ours from Los Angeles. And Senor Amore has told us many stories about playing badminton with Lenny Kravitz and how Janet Jackson once gave him a Jackson 5 T-shirt because he went to school with Janet Jackson, so I kind of believe this Piss Troll story just because all the stuff to do with them is pretty much all true. So I haven't been able to figure out if they're liars or not. So I'm totally down with that piss troll, so it's sitting right on my desk, and hopefully its not evaporating. All the piss is not evaporating into this room. Maybe that's why I've been sick recently, hopefully the lid is on tight.
G: You haven't actually checked to see if it is piss?
N: No, I haven't. It's sealed up very nicely. And again, I'm amazed that you've dug around there, that's incredible.
G: You have said one of your favorite things to do is smelling things. This just hasn't piqued your curiosity?
N: Well I can see it now, it's just on the other side of my computer, but it's not in total view. So I think if I moved it out in front of my computer, get back to me in a couple months and I probably will have smelt it. I've just kind of got it out of sight, so maybe that's a good thing. I'd probably be picking at it right now if it was in front of me.
If people are interested in hearing the Evaporators, as you hadn't heard the Evaporators, we do have theevaporators.com where people can hear clips from the new record, and the old record, and watch some of the vids and stuff like that, and visit the Nard Nest. So and .com, in case anybody's wondering what the hell's going on, so people can read about the Sebastian Bach story there. And the Courtney Love story and the Jello Biafra story.
G: You and Mark Kleiner, who's now in the Mark Kleiner Power Trio used to have this fascination with the band Enuff Z'nuff. Is there any other band now that you'd like to bring up from relative obscurity into relatively less obscurity?
N: Again, I am just so humbled that you have dug so deeply, and brought up a band that I love so much. Thanks so much, I mean this research you've done is amazing, I mean this is really just making me very, wow, I don't know what to say, Enuff Z'nuff. Yes, Mark Kleiner, another great name to bring up. Thank you so for reminding me about Mark Kleiner, I mean how could I ever forget about Mark Kleiner? For years I would just interview punk bands, and then one day Mark Kleiner said "Screw the punk bands, go for the true alternative." And I'm like, what are you talking about? He says "Bands like Green Day and Rancid and all that punk shit, they're getting played on the radio, they're getting played on MTV and MuchMusic. All the hair metal bands have totally died off. They are the true alternative. Why don't you interview Slik Toxik?" They were that Canadian heavy metal band, I don't know if you remember, they crashed their limo after the Juno awards. And there was a rumor that they had changed the name of their band to Slack Toxik, to capitalize on generation X, you know like slacker. So I interviewed Slik Toxik, and then it was natural to go after Warrant, and then after Warrant and all these other heavy metal bands like Skid Row and stuff, you started getting into the second-tiered, double named heavy metal bands like Danger Danger and Enuff Z'nuff. And every interview that we did, we would always refer back to Enuff Z'nuff because they seemed to have gone through the school of hard knocks. They had supported Cheap Trick all these years, and yet when the Cheap Trick tribute album came out they were knocked from it. They'd been supported by Howard Stern all these years, but then when Howard Stern finally had his movie, at last minute, who got the axe? Enuff Z'nuff. So every band we interviewed, we would always mention Enuff Z'nuff. We would even make up fake rumors about Enuff Z'nuff just to get people's reactions, all these other metal bands that we interviewed. And then one day we did interview Enuff Z'nuff, and then of course I had to throw in the lyrics "LA Guns, Enuff Z'nuff, they come to mind but that's not the stuff…"
(The tape ran out at this point without me realizing it, so the rest of the conversation is lost. Basically, Nardwuar mentioned that the one thing he's consciously trying to bring back is the 8-track player, and he sells many of the Evaporators releases in this format. Following a lengthy explanation of how the 8-track works, including demonstrations highlights from Jimmy Smith's "Living It Up" on Verve records, Nardwuar realized he had to leave, and with his ever-present salutation of "Doot-doo-da-loot-doo," he was gone.)

Michael Barron Image 2
HIS name is Mickey, he’s a Disney star and he’s an expert magician – but illusionist Michael Barron is no mouse.
The 27-year-old American is the man responsible for bringing to life the amazing magical effects during the Disney Live! show which will arrive at the Braehead Arena next month.
But Michael told The Glaswegian he found it funny he had ended up in a job that was so similar to that of his childhood hero Mickey Mouse.
He said: “More than anyone, as a kid I identified with Mickey.
“I’ve been doing magic since I was a little kid and my dream was always to become a professional magician. When I was six, my parents took me to see David Copperfield and that was it for me.
“In the cartoons, Mickey was also a magician and when I was a little, kid my dad used to call me Mickey, so I do have this personal identification with the character.
“Little did I know that 20 years later I would be performing all over the world with Disney.”
Michael spent years practicing to become a magician and was eventually snapped up by Disney bosses after they saw him performing his own show in Orlando, Florida, near Disneyland.
In his role with Disney, he performs incredible illusions and tricks alongside beloved characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Goofy and Donald Duck.
Michael, from Florida, said that many audience members were amazed by the quality of the magic.
He added: “You get to see a lot of cool stuff. I’m going to be splitting a lady in two, I’m also going to be escaping from a sealed box in under a second and there’s a beautiful levitation scene where I levitate Princess Jasmine.
“There are memorable scenes from the movies like Alice in Wonderland, where the Mad Hatter pulls all kinds of crazy things from his hat. There’s also an amazing sorcerer’s apprentice scene from Fantasia.
“It’s really fast-paced and will keep everyone interested in the show.
“But for me, being able to look into the audience and see those genuine reactions from people is my favourite part.”
Disney Live! is at Braehead Arena from July 11 to 15.

WestJet reports record May traffic
Tuesday, June 05, 2012
Airline flies an additional 100,000 guests year over year and reports 7.2 per cent increase in traffic
CALGARY, June 5, 2012 /PRNewswire/ - WestJet today announced May traffic results with a load factor of 79.2 per cent. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), or traffic, increased 7.2 per cent year over year, and capacity, measured in available seat miles (ASMs), grew 1.3 per cent over the same period. The airline flew more than 100,000 additional guests this month compared to May of 2011.
"We are very pleased with this month's load factor and forward bookings are showing continued strength as we head into the busy summer flying season," said WestJet President and CEO Gregg Saretsky.
WestJet recently implemented Korean Air as its sixth code-share partner and has launched seven new interline arrangements thus far in 2012, bringing a total of 24 alliance relationships to connect its guests throughout the world.

Chef.
Sure, you love butter. Who doesn’t? But how much do you love butter? Is this beginning to sound uncomfortably close to King Lear? Overwrought declarations of love on stage are one thing. But perhaps it’s a bit much when it comes to butter. Then again, maybe not. Meet Chef Devwrat Anand Jategaonkar. He loves butter. And fairy tales. Love conquers all? Sometimes, it does.
Chef. Also a fairytale. And, to be perfectly honest, we suspect a little bit of magic too. How else do you transport a delicate butter sculpture depicting Cinderella from Alibaug in Maharashtra to Erfurt in Germany.
Discussing how he worked on the sculpture for two months, Chef Devwrat says he was inspired by the fantasy and romance of Cinderella. “It’s a story everyone knows. But it’s more than that,” he says, discussing how the ‘Prince’ is a metaphor for the dreams coming true. Now, at the risk of killing some of the romance, we have to tell you that butter sculptures are actually made with margarine, which holds better. It however looks and feels like butter, with its warm colour and gleaming texture. “I like to keep it natural. That yellow is so beautiful,” says Chef Devwrat. He goes on to discuss the challenges. “The temperature has to be maintained at 20 degrees C, and you need to do it in stages, since each part needs time to set after it’s been carved.”
Transportation hurdles
However, the biggest challenge he faced was transportation. “The roads out of Alibaug are not very smooth. It took us seven hours to get to the airport, because I asked the driver to move at a speed of 10 to 15 km/hr.” He adds with a laugh, “The AC was on full blast, and we were all shivering.” When they reached the airport, it took a while to convince the airline to let the 3 ft x 3 ft x 3 ft sculpture travel. “The Lufthansa staff was shocked when I said I wanted to put it in a container with wheels and store it in the luggage hold! But I had no other option. They said it would reach in two pieces. It survived. “We checked in Frankfurt and there was minor damage, but at least Cinderella was okay!” Almost three hours by taxi later, Chef Devwrat and his sculpture were safely ensconced in a hotel room. “The temperature in Germany was perfect for the sculpture: 13 degrees.”
All the effort was worth it in the end. He won a silver in a competition featuring 550 participants. “It was so unexpected. Chefs had done amazing things. There was a sugar sculpture of Queen Elizabeth II that was so perfect it felt like she was standing in front of you. There was a chocolate warrior. And a beautiful sculpture in salt called ‘Unexpected Attack,’ showing a man on a camel being pounced on by a lion.”
Discussing how this was possible only because of the support he received from Radisson Blu, Alibaug, where he is executive chef, Devwrat says it’s a big step forward for a small town boy. “I grow up in Akola, near Nagpur. I wanted to move to Pune because it was a bigger city. But when I went there to study hotel management, it was so difficult. My English wasn’t good, my accent was different, I missed my friends and family… I almost gave up. Then I discovered carving. Made some beetroot flowers.” That’s how it all began.
many Congratulations!!
For readers information Mr. Devwrat also host a cookery show on Marathi
channel.

Nikolai Khabibulin’s tenure with the Chicago Blackhawks could be drawing to a close this week.
After Khabibulin cleared waivers last week, Blackhawks GM Dale Tallon gave Jay Grossman, the veteran goalie’s agent, permission to speak with other NHL teams in hopes of finding a potential trade partner.
Grossman claimed several teams expressed interest in Khabibulin, while Tallon said he’d be exploring all options, including the possibility of loaning the netminder to a team in Russia’s Kontinental League.
Tallon would prefer to find an NHL team for the veteran goalie and even suggested if no deal could be found Khabibulin would play for the Blackhawks, but that was greeted with skepticism by most observers.
Speculation abounds as to potential NHL destinations for Khabibulin. The Ottawa Senators and Colorado Avalanche were rumored to be interested, but management for both teams dismissed those reports.
The Los Angeles Kings have been linked to Khabibulin throughout the summer, but GM Dean Lombardi has maintained he’ll be going with Jason LaBarbera as his starting goalie and will look within his own system for a backup.
Grossman and Tallon agreed it would be best for this situation to be resolved as soon as possible, preferably before the Blackhawks season opener Oct. 10.
• Boston Bruins GM Peter Chiarelli admitted he’s in the market for a top defenseman, but hasn’t had much success finding one and dismissed a recent rumor that first-line center Marc Savard was being shopped.
In addition to his search for a defenseman, the Bruins GM is also looking at ways to free up cap space to make room for promising youngsters, notably winger Blake Wheeler.
Reports out of Boston suggest winger Peter Schaefer could be on his way out. However, a $2.1-million cap hit for the next two seasons and a disappointing performance in 2007-08 (nine goals, 26 points in 63 games) could make him impossible to move.
Another possibility is veteran winger P-J Axelsson, who’s been a fixture in the rumor mill for more than a year, but has a limited no-trade clause allowing him to authorize 20 possible trade partners.
Young forward Phil Kessel was rumored to have been available last season, but his name has yet to pop up in the recent Bruins rumors. It’s believed Chiarelli doesn’t want to give up on Kessel, who has the potential to be a scoring star, but the first round draft pick’s work ethic - especially in his defensive game - has been called into question.
• The Minnesota Wild’s effort to re-sign star forward Marian Gaborik is not looking good.
The Minneapolis Star-Tribune recently reported talks appear to be at a standstill as GM Doug Risebrough admitted he didn’t expect Gaborik to be re-signed before the start of this season.
Risebrough suggested it was possible he’d consider trading Gaborik if an impasse couldn’t be broken, but declined to say if he’s already spoken to potential suitors.
The Wild management doesn’t want negotiations to become a distraction by dragging on throughout the season, but it appears unlikely Risebrough will move Gaborik early in the year, preferring to use the time to negotiate a potential deal. If nothing appears imminent by December, he could start shopping the talented, yet injury-prone.

I couldn’t disagree with them more. I don’t think severely penalizing players for their recklessness will automatically transform the NHL into the National Ringette League. But they do. And they’re smart, passionate men who have an enormous amount of experience at virtually every level of the game.
So the news the GMs have deferred the issue to a to-be-named committee of seven GMs who will report back with recommendations at some point certainly won’t please everyone. But in light of the fact it has become increasingly clear there will never, ever be a blanket rule banning head shots in the NHL, it’s about as much as we can expect.
There is an appetite to have the blindside hits against unsuspecting players dealt with and the GMs held up the recent Mike Richards hit on David Booth as one that is currently legal, but might be a suspendable offense by this time next year. But how exactly do you remove those kinds of hits without taking a vital element out of the game?
“I don’t think any of us knows the answer to that,” said Nashville Predators GM David Poile. “That’s why we are where we are. It is certainly in our craw that if there’s a way to get rid of those 10 hits (a season), we’re going to do it.”
So, here’s the plan. Director of hockey operations Colin Campbell will soon appoint seven GMs to a committee that will form a breakout group at the next GM meetings in March. That group will monitor hits throughout the rest of this season and be provided with data from the league. It will then spend the first day of the March meetings discussing recommendations, which will then be presented to the entire group of GMs. If adopted by the GMs, the recommendations will then go to the competition committee, then to the board of governors for any potential change to the rulebook.
Doesn’t exactly scream a call to action, does it? Perhaps not. But there seems to be a resolve among this group to get rid of the Richards-Booth types of hits where a vulnerable player who couldn’t possibly see a hit coming takes one in the head and is carted off on a stretcher.
“It’s not easy, but if I were to characterize the group, I would say that it’s more serious than I’ve ever seen it before,” said Buffalo Sabres GM Darcy Regier. “It’s viewed as being more serious than ever before and more important to work on.”
Related Links
Recent hits such as the Mattias Ohlund hit on Phil Kessel, the Chris Neil hit on Victor Hedman or the Willie Mitchell hit on Jonathan Toews will never be outlawed by this group of GMs the way they might be if there were a blanket ban on head shots. Almost to a man, they view those kinds of hits as good hockey plays that are a deep part of the fabric of the game. And maybe they’re trying too hard to justify themselves here, but they are also quick to point out the types of hits that are most heinous are the exception rather than the rule.
“Over the course of a season, there are probably about a dozen hits that we can all remember that we all wish we could have back, so to speak,” Poile said. “Over the course of a game, there’s 40-plus hits and if you multiply that out, that’s about 50,000 hits in a season. To get rid of these 10 hits, what’s the right thing to do?”
It doesn’t help that all of this is so open to interpretation. A hit one person might view as a heinous crime could be viewed by another as a good hockey play that shouldn’t even be penalized. That was certainly the spectrum of opinion on the recent hit in the Ontario League on Ben Fanelli that earned Michael Liambas a season-long suspension.
Even the Richards hit on Booth isn’t entirely clear-cut.
“There was something about the Richards-Booth situation; it was a feeling that there’s just something that wasn’t right about that hit and we’d like to change that type of hit,” Poile said. “That one didn’t sit well with the managers.”
MEETING OF THE U.S. MINDS
U.S. Olympic team GM Brian Burke used the meetings as a chance to meet with assistant GM David Poile and advisors Ray Shero, Don Waddell and Dean Lombardi on the makeup of the team for the Vancouver Games.
Burke said the team would continue to work on its roster before meeting again in December at the board of governors meeting in Pebble Beach. But he gave the impression that a good number of the decisions have already been made.
“Then we’re going to chase guys,” Burke said of the plan after the Pebble Beach meeting. “We’re going to split up and chase guys. Hopefully, we’ll be down to two or three decisions to make because the bulk of the roster is coming together in our minds.”.

Reggie Bush and Kim Kardashian: Komfortable in Front of the Kameraby Hilton Hater at .
Reggie Bush turned 24 last week.
In his honor, girlfriend Kim Kardashian said she got her man "a really nice watch," a rather mundane gift compared to what she got him behind closed doors (if you know what we mean!).
Kim also partied it up with Bush, who she told reporters has "gotten a lot more comfortable in front of the cameras."
That may be true. But he'll never kompete with the komfort Kim exhibits in front of a kamera.
Enjoy these photos of Kardashian, Bush and others celebrating the football star's birthday:

"My daughter is living a true love story," Carla's mother, Marisa Borini, told France's Le Parisien today, commenting on just how serious her relationship with Sarkozy has become. "I think that she could very well end up with Nicolas."
Carla Bruni and Nicolas Sarkozy are getting very serious.
As People magazine reports, Borini told Italian news outlets earlier this month that her daughter had received a marital proposal from Sarkozy, with a New Year's acceptance deadline.
In Sunday's exclusive interview with Le Parisien, the self-described "very Italian mamma" said she participated in pre-vacation discussions with the couple concerning how they envision Bruni's future role.
"If Carla becomes the first lady of France, she'll have to keep space and time for herself to write," said her mom. "She needs to write her poems, compose music, record her albums. The same with her other obligations she may have, she'll need to arrange her time."

The Hub is always a lively and fun place to be. This is entirely due to our team who work tirelessly to cater for our customers' needs.
Robin Love
Robin is most often found behind the Post Office counter and has the illustrious title of Post Master. Robin came to Ambleside as Post Master in 1996 after a 20 year career with the Royal Bank of Scotland. He is a familiar sight at many Lake District events including the Rotary Club, Football Club, Windermere Golf Club and thrives on being part of the community.
"I love the diversity of The Hub and knowing that we're providing a vital service to both the local community and visitors alike."
Karen Love
It's Karen we have to thank for the stunning selection of cards found at The Hub. She strives to find high quality cards that are a little bit unusual with something to fit any occasion. Before starting the business with Robin 12 years ago, Karen had a career in customer service with Nationwide Building Society. During her time in Ambleside, Karen has seen many changes in the area.
"The tastes and demands of visitors to the area have changed dramatically in recent years. Local hotels,restaurants and B & Bs have significantly upgraded their facilites to accommodate the new generation of customer. Ambleside is certainly moving in the right direction to become a world class destination with accommodation to suit every need and budget"
Mo Deluce
Mo (short for 'human dynamo') is often one of the first people you'll meet behind the Tourist Information counter. She's a former Lake District pub landlady and has been in catering for many years, she really understands what visitors are looking for when visiting the area - her local knowledge is astonishing. If thats not enough, Mo used to teach juggling and believes anyone can learn to become a competent juggler. Mo loves a challenge at work, but her advice to visitors is : "We can help you better if you plan ahead and call us in advance if you can. It gives us a little extra time to help you find the best accommodation or information that will really help you get the most from your visit"
Sharon Murray
Sharon is a familiar face behind the Post Office counter. Like many of the staff at the Hub, Sharon too has experience of the Lake District hospitality business having run a busy hotel in the centre of Ambleside. She loves the community service aspect of working in the Post Office and believes passionately in the valuable service it provides.
"Even though behind the glass counter, we do get to know many people in the local community. For some people, particularly the elderly, coming to the Post Office and having a little chat with us is the only social interaction they have. We notice if someone has not been in for awhile and often find ourselves making enquiries to check they are ok. Our job is not just about stamps and car tax, its about people and Post Offices provide a valuable service to local communities everywhere.
Elizabeth Johnson
Elizabeth joined Ambleside Post Office from the busy main Post Office where she spent 13 years. In that time, Elizabeth has come across every question and issue relating to the Post Office imaginable.
"The Post Office probably offers the most diverse range of products and services available in any one place. It's our job to advise and guide our customers so they can get the most from the service. One of the biggest issues I come across time after time, is that many people don't read the forms properly and fail to bring the right documentation for say , passport applications or car tax. My one piece of advice would be, take a little extra time reading the forms and following the precise instructions and it will save you so much time later on."

Those who opposed this song/video are being childish and petty. If they wanted to make your own video, they are more than welcome to, as I'm sure the group that made this one would acknowledge. The right to support a political candidate through music does not stop with the, "You can't use that music because it's ours." This area is wonderfully diverse and culturally rich and that a group came together in a common cause should be applauded. If another group chooses to do the same, by all means use the medium of our wonderful music to do so also. It isn't your music, it isn't my music, it's our music.
For once, can we be a country united as well as a state united. Pettiness is how we will fall apart as a country. Thank you for being a fine example of that!

The Indiana Supreme Court has accepted four cases on transfer, including one in which they released an opinion on the matter
the same day they granted transfer.
On Feb. 8, the justices took Mariea L. Best v. Russell C. Best, No. 06S05-1102-CV-73 and released an opinion upholding modification of physical custody of their daughter to Russell Best.
On February 10, they granted transfer to three more cases – Misty D. Davis v. Animal Control – City of Evansville, et al., No. 82S01-1102-CV-77; Mary Beth & Perry Lucas v. U.S. Bank N.A., et al., No. 28S01-1102-CV-78; and Rod L. Avery, et al. v. Trina Avery, No. 49S05-1102-PL-76.
In Davis, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed in a not-for-publication opinion summary judgment for the city defendants in this action following injuries Shawn Davis received from a dog bite. At issue was whether the defendants had immunity from this claim. The majority ruled no, and Judge Kirsch dissented, holding the underlying action falls within the immunity set forth in Indiana Code Section 34-13-3-3(8).
In Lucas, the Court of Appeals held on interlocutory appeal that the Lucases, whose home was being foreclosed on, are entitled to a jury trial on their legal claims against their mortgage holder and loan servicer. The judges relied on Songer v. Civitas Bank, 771 N.E.2d 61, 63 (Ind. 2002), to find they are entitled to a jury trial on their claims of conversion and deception, alleged violations of the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act, and other state and federal statutory law and state common law claims.
In Avery, the appellate judges addressed an issue of first impression and held that a will contest is a civil action and a defendant in this type of action is required to file an answer or plead to a complaint as provided by the state’s trial rules.

Some parents of a Morgan County middle. He referenced a specific state education standard -- 7.1.4 -- as the reason Islamic studies are part of curriculum."I can give you a couple of examples that we've done. For example, these kids, when they're done with this culmination, which is a comparison of the religions that the state of Indiana has, they're going to be able to write like 'The Diary of Anne Frank,'" Bowlen said. "In class, I have had students write a letter home from the war front as if they are a soldier fighting for our country. Obviously, I am not recruiting the children for the military, but I am putting them in a position to understand what a soldier will go through."Parent Lisa Ratts said she disagrees with Fletcher and is happy that her son is being exposed to the cultures of others."What concerns me and what upsets me is that I think this is such a beautiful thing, learning about other people's cultures," she said.Bowlen said that parents who have an issue with an assignment should talk to him, and that the school is willing to be flexible.Bowlen said the Islam assignment may be adjusted in the future to include different options for students.

ST. CLAIRSVILLE - Murray Energy Corp. is bringing its new 60,000-square-foot headquarters to St. Clairsville to consolidate corporate operations now taking place at four separate locations.
The parent company of American Energy Corp.'s Century Mine, Ohio Valley Coal Co.'s Powhatan No. 6 mine and OhioAmerican Energy Inc.'s Red Bird West mine is moving 149 offices into a four-story structure set for construction just off National Road between Ohio 331 and the East Richland Evangelical Friends Church.
"The building will contain all of the amenities needed to provide a productive environment for Murray Energy's folks," said Joe Fraley, construction project manager, noting the structure will sit on a 16.1-acre site.

Land preparation is ongoing, with construction set to follow. The projected completion date is the end of May, with a planned move-in date of June 2012. A pavilion, small lake and all landscaping features will be included.
Robert Murray, founder and chief executive officer of Murray Energy, said, "Our companies have never had the money to construct a central office headquarters. If we had any money, we always spent it on a new piece of mining equipment or to create jobs."
The new office will house the corporation's central operating, engineering, maintenance, geologic, purchasing, accounting, information systems, environmental and sales staff.
In addition to the three.
"Our central staff employees are now located at four different locations in three counties in Ohio and West Virginia, and this has become very inefficient," Murray said. "We can actually show cost savings in having our key staff members at one location, providing a payback to the company for the facility."
According to the company's website, Murray Energy produces about 30 million tons of coal per year and employs 3,000 people "in some of the most economic depressed regions in the United States."

>> did the Library Loot post with no loot to share. This week it is a different story altogether!
I may have actually cheated this week by not only borrowing books on my own library card, but also on my son's card as well! We went to the new library branch (oh, the new library smell) and there was a library full of new books, and I couldn't resist borrowing a couple of books even though I knew that I really didn't have enough room of my own. As tempting as it is, I really don't want to get into the habit of doing that too often.
Mr Linky is up at Eva's blog this week, so please be sure to share your library loot there!
My loot this week is:
Dreamfever by Karen Marie Moning - This is the latest book in the Fever series by Karen Marie Moning. I haven't been blown away by the series as a whole, but I am happy enough to keep reading it until the end having already read the previous three books in the series.
The Kingmaking by Helen Hollick
I have been sent Pendragon's Banner for review. I know they say that you can read it without having read The Kingmaking, but I prefer to read books in order when they are connected.
Rumour Has It by Jill Mansell - I've read a couple of Jill Mansell books so far this year and really enjoyed them. This was the latest release as far as I can tell.
Everything Beautiful by Simmone Howell
A few weeks ago The Book Smugglers held the YA Appreciation Week. In my post, I mentioned that I didn't know that many Australian YA authors, and this is one that was recommended by Ana.
Ironbark by Johanna Nicholls - It's not often that I pick up a book on impulse when I am at the shops but every now and again it happens. I saw this book at a shop a few weeks ago and I very nearly bought it, but in the end I decided against it. When I came home and checked the library catalogue they had it on order, but it has taken until now to actually arrive at the library.
Men of the Otherworld by Kelley Armstrong
I am pretty sure that if Kelley Armstrong started writing on the back of toilet paper, I would still want to read it. This book has been on order for the new library for what feels like forever! I am so excited by the prospect of reading it!
The Lost Prophecies by The Medieval Murderers - The Medieval Murderers are Bernard Knight, C J Sansom, Ian Morson, Michael Jecks, Philip Gooden and Susanna Gregory. This was a totally impulsive pick up. I mean, I couldn't leave a library branch without borrowing a new book could I?
Reloot
The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss - I borrowed this a few weeks ago as a result of the review I read at Book Smugglers, but had to return it unread. Maybe this time!
3 Willows by Anna Brashares - I returned this unread a while ago. This time I have borrowed the audio book, and I am planning to read it during the very long trip to Adelaide this weekend. I am hoping that it will help the time pass quicker than it normally would. A ten hour drive in a car with my mother is not necessarily my idea of a good time!
They all look good. I just finished Dreamfever...you will need to sit on a block of ice while reading this hot and steamy book!!!
Love the cover of Everything Beautiful! The Lost Prophecies sounds so neat, and the cover makes me want to see it. :D
I just started reading Women of the Otherworld by Kelley Armstrong. Totally loving it so far!
Mmmmm.... new library smell! Everything Beautiful is an interesting book. Hope you like it!
I have the first book in the Otherworlds series and am really looking forward to reading it. Hope you enjoy all your library books this week and get a chance to read everything!
Zibilee and Linda, I liked the first book but wasn't totally enthralled by it. The series just got stronger and stronger, and now I count Kelley Armstrong among my favourite authors!
Melissa, to be honest I don't even know much about it!
Eva, I think this book is actually part of a series, but I haven't been able to figure out how they are connected, same detective? same location? Not sure yet.
Staci, I will go put a big block of ice in the freezer then!
Looks like a great assortment of books. 3 Willows has caught my eye!
Great idea for a post. It's always interesting to see what books people are reading. You will like Men of the Otherworld, though I didn't find it quite as good as Bitten. I'm currently reading from my library - Stolen by Ms. Armstrong.
I own The Name of the Wind and STILL haven't read it... One day...

Jokowi Narrows Foke’s Lead for Jakarta Governor
Ronna Nirmala
Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo’s popularity has taken a hit in the past two months, to the benefit of his closest rival, but the incumbent is still the favorite to win the upcoming gubernatorial election, a new survey suggests.
The results of the poll by the Indonesian Survey Circle (LSI), published on Sunday, showed that 43.3 percent of the respondents said they would vote for Fauzi.
That figure was down from 49.1 percent in a similar poll carried out in late March by the LSI.
The new survey showed that of the six candidates, only Solo Mayor Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, saw his popularity rise during the past two months, going from 14.4 percent to 20.9 percent.
Toto Izul Fatah, the LSI executive director, said the findings were significant because they showed Jokowi faring much better than the other challengers and taking a big chunk out of Fauzi’s lead.
“He’s become a candidate who must be reckoned with, and the incumbent will have to watch out for him,” Toto said. “If Jokowi can build on this trend with a variety of community programs, then he will certainly threaten the incumbent.”
He attributed Jokowi’s rising popularity to his camp’s “cleverly packaged” campaign programs.
No other candidates managed to garner more than 10 percent in the LSI poll.
Toto said part of the reason that Fauzi remained popular despite Jokowi’s onslaught was that he was seen as a figure of authority amid rising security threats in the capital.
“The respondents raised concerns about Jakarta becoming more unsafe because of the proliferation of hard-line groups, as seen in opposition to the Irshad Manji book discussion and the Lady Gaga concert,” Toto said. “What the respondents are looking for is someone like [former governor] Ali Sadikin, who had the guts to stand up for diversity and put hard-liners in their place.”
Toto said the Ali comparison was important because three out of four respondents said they wanted the next governor to have the same qualities as Ali, who governed from 1966 to 1977.
He said that when polled, 41 percent of the respondents said none of the candidates had Ali’s qualities. But 22.4 percent said Fauzi came closest, followed by Jokowi at 8.6 percent.
The book discussion by Manji, a liberal Muslim advocate from Canada, was broken up in early May by the extremist Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), whose threats of violence also prompted Lady Gaga to cancel her concert in Jakarta scheduled for next weekend.
The survey also showed high approval for various programs under Fauzi’s administration, but Iberamsjah, a political analyst from the University of Indonesia, said those were all old programs and the incumbent had brought nothing new since coming to office.
“You have to understand that the programs that Fauzi’s been running all this time are those that were initiated by Sutiyoso [the previous governor],” he said.
He added that many programs introduced by Fauzi had in fact failed, including attempts to expand the TransJakarta busway network.
Toto said that the LSI’s latest survey echoed projections by the group’s earlier poll that Fauzi would not win the election in a single round and that it would go to a runoff vote.
Though the survey in March identified a range of possible opponents to face the incumbent in the runoff, this time Toto said it was looking more like a Fauzi-Jokowi faceoff.
The poll showed that if the election was held today, 49 percent of the respondents would vote for Fauzi while 27.8 percent would vote for Jokowi. The rest were either undecided or unwilling to disclose their preferences.

Fed up with conflict over how women can worship at the Western Wall, a group of Jewish feminists has begun reconstruction of the Eastern Wall, where they expect to be able to do as they please, thank you very much.
Former prime minister and ex-Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert paved the way for the unusual arrangement through a deal his lawyers admitted was a breach of trust but not illegal. Pink Floyd's Roger Waters will also help build the wall.
Israel’s chief rabbis and 613 members of the Shas Party vowed to block the construction and initially went on a hunger strike that lasted until the smell of cholent filled their homes on Erev Shabbos. They then announced that they would refuse to bench, wash negelvasser or recite the second Y’kum Pirkun until the wall construction was blocked by the police. Later this week, however, there was word of a deal in which the haredim would relent in exchange for a modification of the new Tal Law that allowed only Litvaks to be drafted while keeping Galicianers exempt.

What in the giddy fathoms of fuck is this? Thanks to a merry band of kraken-lovers I have been sent details of a product that is available on the website of trinket-floggers Argos. Thing is, before I tell you about said product you need to be warned that I have become so hysterical with rage that the rest of this blog might set fire to your eyes. Ready? Got your shades? Good.
See, Argos is pimping a pack of two Disney t-shirts for 3 – 4 year olds girls. So far, so blah. Thing is, each t-shirt contains what looks like words but is actually distilled horseshit that’s been scrawled with the use of a rotting lollipop stick. One reads “I like boys but I like shoes more” and another reads “Three wishes: boys, shoes and beautiful dresses”. No, I’m not shitting you. Not one tiny bit.

We love these covers over Thirsties fitteds or over prefolds. Over bulkier fitteds they don't work very well. I love that they have cross-over velcro tabs as well as laundry tabs. They also have great leg gussets to help keep everything in! The colors are pretty cool too!

Night work may boost women’s breast cancer risk, says study
PARIS, June 20 — Night work may increase a woman’s chances of developing breast cancer by 30 per cent — a slightly elevated but “statistically significant” risk, French researchers said yesterday.PARIS, June 20 — Night work may increase a woman’s chances of developing breast cancer by 30 per cent — a slightly elevated but “statistically significant” risk, French researchers said yesterday.
This placed night work in the same order of risk as factors like genetic mutation, a late first pregnancy or hormonal treatment, Pascal Guenel, director of French health research body INSERM, told AFP.
Put into context, a smoker was eight times as likely to contract lung cancer as a woman working night shifts was to get breast cancer, he explained.
About 1.3 million women around the world are diagnosed with breast cancer every year.
In a study published in the International Journal of Cancer, the INSERM-led team said an association between night work with breast cancer “was mainly observed in women working during overnight shifts, those who worked at night for 4.5 or more years and less than three nights per week on average.
“The association was stronger in women who worked at night before their first full-term pregnancy than in women who started working at night later in life.”
The scientists said more study was needed to determine the reasons.
Hypotheses include disruption of “body clock” genes, internal desynchronisation and sleep deprivation altering the immune system.
The study was conducted in France among 1,232 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2005 and 2007. — AFP/Relaxnews

‘SimCity’ concept art showing a casino complex. — AFP/Relaxnews picLOS ANGELES, March 7 — It’ll be the fifth main entry to the SimCity series, but it won’t be called SimCity V. Instead, 2013’s swishest SimCity yet will take the title of its oldest ancestor.
That 1989 groundbreaker famously started life as a development tool for an entirely different game, Raid on Bungeling Bay, before becoming an engrossing simulation of the urban microcosm in its own right.
It was hugely influential in popularising the city-building genre, now home to the seven-game Settlers series, Anno’s five-game world odyssey, and Tropico’s four explorations of benevolent dictatorship, eventually leading to the creation of The Sims.
Next year’s SimCity once again looks at the big picture of city life, promising to become “the most sophisticated simulation of its kind,” with the “fun, flavour and playability that has been intrinsic to the franchise.”
There’ll be nods to the modern, socially networked world, as players’ own progress can affect that of their friends, the sort of concept familiar to those who dabble in Facebook games from Empires & Allies to CivWorld.
They’ll also be able to put their heads together, trying to crack real-world problems such as climate changes, the depletion of natural resources, and — a series staple — coping with the impact of natural disasters. — AFP/Relaxnews

Athletic Club to Induct First Class to Hall of Fame
For the first time in several years, five former Clay County athletes will be inducted into the Clay County Hall of Fame.
Russ Chadwell, Richie Farmer, Victor Hyland, Vonda Jackson, and Kim Jones represent the 2010 Hall of Fame class.
Clay County Athletic Club President Les Nichoslon was enthused about bringing back the tradition of the Hall of Fame.
“There hasn’t been an induction in quite some time, and we felt it was time to pick up the tradition and start again because some of our best athletes haven’t been inducted yet.”
Nicholson also stated he wanted to set the standard with the Athletic Club’s innagural class.
“Our committee was unanimous about these five individuals,” said Nicholson, “I think these five are some of the finest athletes Clay County has ever produced without a doubt. We wanted to set the bar as high as we could go with our first class.”
A meal will be served to honor the five inductees at 5:30 Friday night before the Bobby Keith Classic basketball games at CCHS.
Tickets for the meal can be purchased for $10 at Silverscreen Video.
The induction ceremony will take place in the CCHS Auditorium at 6.

9 Female Characters We Wish We’d Been More Like In High School
Because teenagerdom is a mess, but some people handle it better than others.
by Jamie Frevele | 12:55 pm, May 14th, 2011
Kyle Munkittrick at Discover has an amazing essay on what Disney’s Pixar movies have taught us what it really means to be human — without being an actual human person. And not just that, but also what this means for how humans will react with other entities in the future, such as technology. The way Disney and Pixar have accomplished this is by creating entire worlds without humans as the main focus, or even present. As a result, we might be learning that it’s a bad idea to underestimate the intelligence of animals, robots, and even other humans.
Besides Disney being so successful at telling good stories that appeal to adults and children alike, their writers have also been stealthily inserting messages about humanity, all while telling stories that are not even about humans. But therein lies the question: What makes someone or something really human?
Munkittrick cites the origins of Pixar stories in The Lion King:.
But all those animals display the same emotions we do: love, anger, grief, a sense of family and pride. I know, because they are anthropomorphized creatures in a Disney movie, but hear me out for a moment.
Now that we’ve been introduced to a world without humans, now humans can be introduced. All of Pixar’s films take place in the regular, human world. Earth. However, both the non-human creatures and the humans that are featured as main characters are misfits, non-conformists. Like Linguini in Ratatouille, but also Ratatouille himself, who is shunned by his rat family for wanting to be a chef. The important thing to remember about Pixar movies is that the non-humans are just as intelligent and sentient as the humans are. (And not because of magic.) Everyone is evenly matched, everyone is feeling the same range of emotions. (If they’re not, they are probably the antagonist.) And while the odd couples might not get along at first, it’s their mission to learn to respect what each has to offer and realize that they’re not so different after all. Their needs are the same, and they just want to work together..
And this all leads to the battle for “the rights of personhood.”.
The entire essay is definitely worth a read, and you may never watch a Pixar film the same way again. Certainly, we got sentimental after watching Toy Story, which was a wonderful nostalgia trip back to childhood. But now, we can consider looking forward, to a future of WALL-Es and Dugs, and maybe even the Incredibles. And then underestimate them at our own risk!

Capcom Finally Brings Over Monster Hunter to Wii U and 3DS: Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate in March 2013
Capcom will be releasing Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate in March 2013 for Wii U and 3DS and will feature
online play. Is it based off of Monster Hunter 3G, previously only released on the 3DS? No idea as there has been no details revealed about it other than we’re going to Monster Hunter represented in North America yet again.
Edit:All right, maybe there is no online play.
Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate will allow you to play locally up to four players. The Wii U will be able to link with the 3DS to also take part in the hunt. Save data can be passed back and forth so you can take your monster hunting ON THE GO!
… Yes, I felt like saying that.

This is a guest post by Jill Marinelli, Style and Beauty Expert:?”
Work at home these three steps:
1. Create a Style Vision Board
Vision boards are based on the law of attraction – like attracts like. They are a visual representation of things you want in your life.
Vision boards utilize a part of your brain called the reticular activating system (RAS). The role of the RAS is to filter out stimuli, preventing sensory overload. At the same time, it picks out information from your environment that is valuable to you and brings it to your attention.
Creating a vision board programs your RAS to recognize and pay attention to things that are in alignment with your goals. Your job is to take action when opportunities present themselves!
To create a style-specific vision board, cut or print out pictures of clothing styles that appeal to you from websites, magazines, and catalogs. Cut out anything you are innately attracted to, want more of, are inspired by, or just love for no apparent reason. The key is to make no judgments i.e. “that wouldn’t look good on me”.
As well, select pictures of people and words that inspire you and hold the qualities that you admire; for example, the elegance of Audrey Hepburn or the relaxed casualness of Jennifer Aniston.
The process of choosing these combinations of objects and events helps them stay in your subconscious mind and steer your choices toward making your vision real. You will notice themes emerging – colors, textures and patterns that will be excellent guides when you are shopping.
Attach your pictures to a poster board or bulletin board and place it somewhere you see it often. You want to bathe your subconscious mind with its energy – and thus, manifest your desires!
2. Clean out Your Closet
Using your vision board as a guide, go through everything in your closet. Do the items in your closet reflect who you are right now? The average woman wears 20% of her clothes, 80% of the time. Too many women keep clothing from years ago that may no longer fit or reflect their current style.
Ask yourself: Does this flatter me? If I saw it in a store today, would I buy it again? Do I feel good when I wear it? Get rid of anything that doesn’t fit, flatter or make you feel fabulous!
Getting dressed is so much easier when your closet is pared down to just the garments that make you look and feel great!
The key is to honor who you are right now – not who you were 10 years or 10 pounds ago.
3. Create a Uniform
Anyone who has kids that wear uniforms to school knows that this saves time, guesswork, and in some cases, emotional anguish for both kids and mom!.
I encourage moms to create their own version of a uniform. It should make sense for your lifestyle and be easy to throw on quickly! I like to think of a uniform as a canvas to which you can add accessories and make it unique. Accessories are an inexpensive way to experiment with a new style and can be some of the most versatile items in your wardrobe.
My uniform is jeans and a t-shirt. You’ll rarely see me in anything else. I spend a bit more on jeans because I wear them so much, and am careful to find t-shirts that fit really well. I can easily dress up my uniform with darker wash denim and a statement necklace. In summer I switch to a denim skirt or shorts.
Which step will you use to create your own sense of style? How do you define your unique style?

There is some very good advice in this article. Thank you!
I love for discovering and developing your style. It was there I found that I truly love pencil skirts and high heels. I also discovered that I prefer deep reds, plum, and dark teal for my colors, and my preferred neutrals are charcoal or silver gray, black, and chocolate brown.
I have very few clothes, but I love everything I have and can mix and match most items so no matter what I throw on, I can feel confident that I look good. My signature style most prominently features knee length pencil skirts in different fabrics – jean, twill, etc.
Hi Revka, thanks for stopping by and sharing. Glad you liked the tips by Jill. I am definitely going to check out Polyvore.. Thanks so much for sharing it. You’re right, knowing what colors and style you love the most add a lot of confidence!

In general, I am a laid back, easy going person. I was a follower in high school, which even carried over into my young adult life. I went with the flow even if I didn't feel comfortable with it. I think it was because I lacked confidence. I rarely stood up for what I thought was right. I didn't even have an opinion of my own since I always looked to see what others thought and did first. I'm not sure how I became that way. Perhaps, part personality, part up-bringing? Whatever the reasons there are many times today when I think back and wish I knew enough that I could have stood up for what I believed in. To be confident in who I was and have the courage to do so.
My oldest son doesn't really talk a lot. So when he starts telling me about his day my ears perk up and I make an effort no matter what I am doing to stop and listen. The other night he was telling me about the bus ride to school. He was talking about several things and then he mentioned his friend always tells this other boy to go back to his seat. Of course, me being the mom that I am need to clarify, "What do you mean go back to his seat? You are allowed to walk around when the bus is moving?" My son replies, "No mom. When the bus is stopped and we are waiting to get off at school. We are allowed to get out of our seats." Oh! Phew, I'm thinking to myself, but then I am interested about this other boy.
So I ask, "Why does your friend tell this boy to go back to his seat?" "Because he always tries to scare us, but he doesn't really scare us, he just tries to." Me, more interested, "So, is your friend mean about it? Do you tell him to go back to his seat?" He replies, "Sometimes." In my head I'm thinking, "Sometimes! What do you mean? Your friend is sometimes mean or are you sometimes mean?" So instead of verbally rattling off my thoughts and questions because I don't want to deter my son from telling me things. (We know how kids can get when mom starts asking a million questions. They get silent.)
Instead, I tell him "maybe you should try and put yourself in this boys shoes. Maybe he thinks you guys are cool or maybe he doesn't have a brother at home. That is why he tries to scare you and wants to be your friend. But, you shouldn't be mean to him and just because someone else acts one way doesn't make it right for you to do the same. Always do what you know in your heart is right." Okay, so maybe rattling off my own opinion wasn't the right approach either. In any case, my son listened to what I said.
Oh, how I want my boys to grow up being confident in knowing who they are in Christ. Knowing that no matter the circumstance or situation that they will make the right choice, the right decision. To be the leader and not the follower. To be a light in this dark world giving glory to God through their own actions.
For our children to be confident and leaders they need to know Jesus Christ. They need to know who they are in Him, where do they 'fit in' in this big world?
As parents that is our duty. We need to teach them and lead them to a relationship with Him. Teaching our children about our Creator and leading their hearts to Him will give them confidence throughout their lives.
I believe it starts with the understanding that we are sinners and we all need a savior, Jesus Christ. Romans 3:23
Second, to understand and know how much God loves us. That He sent His one and only Son as the ultimate sacrifice so that we could be re-united with God and have eternal life with Him. John 3:16 In turn, we need to love others as God loves us. We are all God's children and we are no better than anyone else. Mark 12:31
Third, to instill a servants heart by leading by example. They will eventually seek and know what purpose God has for them. Proverbs 19:21
Fourth, for them to understand God our Creator is in control. We need to submit our lives to Him and live each day by His will, not ours and that His plans are for prosperity, for hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11; Ephesians 1:11
Lastly, for our children to understand that He is a living, loving God who will never leave us nor forsake us. Deuteronomy 31:8
I started to really seek God soon after my children were born. Not only because I knew I needed Him, but I knew my kids did too. I want them to know their lives have a purpose, for them to not make the same mistakes their parents did. But most importantly, for them to grow up having a relationship with their Heavenly Father and knowing who they are because of who He is and to have that confidence to stand out from the rest of the world no matter what the circumstances are. Simply to be who God created them to be!
"For you have been my hope, Sovereign LORD, my confidence since my youth." Psalm 71:5
2 Share Your Heart :
I know what you mean Dawn. I try to teach my kids how to be leaders and to never be afraid to ask for the things they want. The worst that can happen is that they will be told no but they have seen me in action many times and find out that 9 times out of 10, you will get what you ask for. I want them to have the confidence to go after what they want and the boldness to "just ask". The most important part though is for them to trust God and stay close to him.
I remember a friend once saying, "Everything in life is to drive us to the feet of Jesus. We need to make sure our children know where to find him."
I love your four points. So very important!

City moves forward with renovation project
The Gatlinburg City Commission decided to go ahead with a project that came in approximately $73,000 over budget due to extra details that weren't taken into account, officials said at a commission workshop Tuesday evening.
The Parkway Visitor Center Renovation Project was first proposed in November 2011, and in February 2012 the city approved a grant agreement with the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) regarding the project.
During the February meeting, design consultant Steve Fritts said the cost of the project would be approximately $700,000. Of that total, over $500,000 would be provided by the TDOT grant.
But it turned out that the total cost of the project exceeded the budget by about $73,000.
"There were a number of reasons for that, mainly related to the refinement of the design," Fritts said. "If you remember, back in January (2012) we did a concept ... and that was it. We didn't have any details. ... As we refined it, things unfortunately went up instead of down."
Previously, the city planned to use around $98,000 from already completed projects to cover the renovations, but Finance Director David Beeler said the maneuvering didn't happen.
"We don't know why (the maneuvering failed to happen)," Beeler said.
Beeler said those funds still exist, including roughly $270,000 that went unspent in the Underground Utilities and Streetscape Project. Now, the city is looking to maneuver these funds to cover the cost of the renovations.
"All that maneuvering is more than enough to cover (the total cost) if you want to go with this concept as it's laid out," Beeler said.
Fritts guessed that construction may begin in late February and may be completed in June. City Manager Cindy Ogle assured that no debt would surface from the project.
The project will still retain all the originally planned renovations to the Parkway Visitor Center, located at the intersection of U.S. 321 and U.S. 441 (Traffic Light No. 3), including a splash pad, interpretive mountain areas, expanded seating areas and removal of vegetation.
Commissioner Mark McCown asked whether anything else might cause issues with the project.
"Bad soils," Fritts said. "There's a bunch of tanks that go underground for this fountain system, and until we start excavating and we see what's in the ground we really don't know what we're going to encounter from a soils perspective.
"And it's with every project, and it's what I try to tell most clients: If you've ever built a house, you know you're going to run into something that you want to change."

A seat on the school board, or the city council, offers much more influence than you might think. You can push new approaches to education, affect curriculum and push ideas for how to run schools. You can influence zoning decisions, clamor for tax cuts and tilt policy in your town or city to favor business and other interests. Local and state officials have a tremendous influence on the lives of ordinary people, and over time, Republicans have used this to build support for conservative policies.
There’s a second reason to focus on the local and state: today’s city council members, mayors and state legislators are tomorrow’s congresspeople, senators and governors. Conservatives built a deep bench of like-minded candidates by first electing them on the local level, and then grooming them for higher office.). forty-seven years removed from the official end of Jim Crow. White supremacy was the governing ideology for the vast majority of this country’s history, and—in the broad scheme of things—we’re still in the first legs of our journey toward racial equality.
A.. a Romney presidency, there would be no federal prohibition barring health insurers from discriminating against pre-existing conditions. Instead, his administration would push reforms that help eat away at the problem. It would allow “reinsurance,” in which insurance companies pool resources for a joint plan to cover high-risk patients (essentially an insurance policy for health insurers); provide block grants of Medicaid dollars to the states while giving them flexibility to cover their uninsured population; and encourage the creation of high-risk pools.
The Romney campaign.”

DUBAI // A new Municipality project is set to turn the emirate into the region’s first complete digital city, it has emerged.
The Quick Response (QR) code system will link municipal services through a single electronic system. The code is an encrypted column that can be read using mobile phones with a built-in camera and tag reader. Users take a photo of the code of required services and the proper procedures will be downloaded on the phone.
Municipality services already available include requests for building permit renewal and request for registration for new contractor. Hundreds more will soon be added, said Hussain Nasser Lootah, the municipality’s director general.
“We are moving strongly towards e-government and the major benefits are [that] it is simple and offers us quick calculations,” he said.
Each building in Dubai will have a QR code by the end of next year that can be scanned to gather required information about their specific locations, projects, field visits and outstanding fines.
The structure’s QR code will also store phone numbers, internet and e-mail addresses with a capacity of up to 4,296 characters. The codes have been implemented in cities such as New York.
Municipal officials are currently in talks with government departments such as the police, Civil Defence and the Roads and Transport Authority to connect through the codes, said Marwan Ibrahim Nasser, the head of the municipality’s Follow Up Office.
“If someone spots an emergency like a fire and they are unfamiliar with the area, they can scan the QR code of the building and get through to the right emergency service, which will then pick up the details,” said Mr Nasser.

Assigning street addresses not a simple exercise
I would like to raise some words of caution regarding Every home in Abu Dhabi to have its own address (February 17).
I come from Germany, where urban centres have grown over centuries with no planning regulations at all at the onset.
The result is that, with very few exceptions, the street systems in urban areas are usually far removed from any helpful geometric pattern, like a chessboard or a circular system.
The streets often carry names - of persons, cities, counties, events and so on - that bear no relationship to their location.
What you need is either a very good knowledge of the local street names and their relative positions, or a map with an index and grid reference.
Compared to that, I find the major street numbers in Abu Dhabi very useful - finding a street becomes a simple counting exercise.
But there are problems, including that the buildings have no numbers; some streets have several names - for example, 7th Street is also called Zayed the First Street, and is known colloquially as Electra Street - and there is the repetition of some street numbers.
Also, a very limited number of names are currently in use, with many streets named after the same dignitary.
Under the new system, hundreds of unique, distinguishable names will be required.
J Heil, Abu Dhabi
Modelling the Abu Dhabi street system after the New York system is a good idea (New York sets a good example, February 18).
Don't use London's system. It used to be easy when they included the place's location in the city in its postcode - NW4, for example, was in the north-west - but now their codes have become incomprehensible.

Third time around for Indian author
I refer to your interview with Chetan Bhagat ('What I write seems to resonate with the middle class in India', February 19).
Kai Po Che is not the second of Bhagat's novels to be filmed, it is the third.
His first was not 3 Idiots (based on the book Five Point Something) but a film called Hello based on One Night at a Call Centre.
Maybe Bhagat doesn't like it to be included in his biographical data, but it is.

Space for flexibility over parking fines
When my parking permit expired recently, Mawaqif didn't send me an SMS reminder to say it had expired, nor did it leave me a warning notice on my car.
Instead, it proceeded straight to issuing me a Dh500 fine for parking near where I live. This is steep compared to the cost of the annual permit, which is Dh800.
When I called to complain, the operator simply said: "Sorry, you have to pay."
I encountered one of the Mawaqif inspectors and asked him why I didn't get a warning ticket rather than a fine.
He told me that their hand-held computer system used to tell them if a car had a permit and when that permit expired.
The system has since been modified and they do not now receive this information. Thus, you will get a ticket as soon as your permit expires.
I think Mawaqif should give out at least one warning ticket, with no fine, when a permit expires.
If the driver fails to renew the permit after the warning , then it's OK to fine them. Ziad Q, Abu Dhabi
Over-watering linked to floods
Regarding Overflowing lake sparks flood fears (February 17), an immediate measure to alleviate the situation would be to ease back on the irrigation.
Sprinklers are on in the area every day, in winter and summer.
It stands to reason that this will increase the water table, thus increasing the level of the lake.

In his first press conference since winning reelection Sunday, President Hugo Chávez said he was willing to work with the opposition even as he doubles down on his socialist reforms.
After a vitriolic campaign characterized by insults, Chávez, has been extending olive branches to his adversaries. On Tuesday, he invited them to contribute to his Second Socialist Plan, which will be the roadmap for his next six-year term, from 2013-2019. But he accused the opposition of acting in bad faith in the past and asked them to take a realistic look at the accomplishments of his administration, which include free healthcare and government housing.
They [the opposition] have a catastrophic vision of the country. They deny everything the government does and every achievement the people make, Chávez said. This is the best Venezuela weve had in our 200-year history.
Speaking at the Miraflores presidential palace, Chávez lamented that there are still people who think hes a tyrant or dont believe the nations democratic credentials.
Chávez won his fourth consecutive presidential bid Sunday with 55 percent of the vote, versus 44 percent for opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. The National Election Council said almost 15 million people voted a record turnout for this nation of 30 million.
On Monday night, a few hundred opposition sympathizers closed down a main Caracas street to protest the results.
Capriles said his team had found no evidence of fraud. And the watchdog group Venezuelan Election Observer said it had audited 300 voting centers and found no problems.
Even so, Capriles said he was always at a disadvantage as the government handed out money and houses to win votes as state-run media pumped up the Chávez candidacy.
What we had to deal with on Sunday was brutal, he said.
Chávez will get to put his political prowess to the test again in December, when his hand-picked candidates will be running for governors posts.
Nodding to Vice President Elias Jaua, who sat in the front row of the conference, Chávez assured him he would win his race for Miranda the countrys second-largest state, which includes part of greater Caracas.
But that could be a tough fight. Capriles on Tuesday said he had resumed being governor of the state and was considering running for reelection. If he does run, it could produce a dramatic opposition-government showdown.
Wearing a suit and tie and often sitting behind a desk, Chávez joked with reporters and doodled on sheets of paper as he provided his typical meandering answers.
Asked about the crisis in Syria, Chávez responded in halting English: short question, long answer.
Chávez condemned the United States and others for supporting Syrian rebels, whom he qualified as terrorists, as they try to topple President Bashar Assad.
Its a shame that the world has entered a new era of imperialism, he said. The government of the United States is one of the most responsible for this disaster. Hopefully, if Mr. Obama is reelected, he will reform and reflect.
He likened the months of violence in Syria to the ouster and killing of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya in 2011.
They killed thousands of innocents just to kill a president, Chávez said.
Chávez, was a friend of Gadhafi, and said the mans last message to him was that he was prepared to die a martyr like Cuban revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara.
Chávez also said that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had been trying to congratulate him on his win but the phone call kept dropping.
Syria and Iran face U.N. and other sanctions, and the United States has often condemned Venezuela for cozying up to those regimes. Venezuela is also a supporter of Cuba, sending the island subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban doctors and other services.
Weighing in on the U.S. presidential race, Chávez repeated his claim that he would vote for President Barack Obama if he could, but lamented the countrys polarization. He said Obama had been called a communist just for shaking his hand.
But he said the U.S. leader he would have really liked to have worked with is former President Jimmy Carter, who he called a man of peace. A few weeks before the election, Carter had called Venezuelas voting system the best in the world.
We would have really accomplished things for this world, Chávez mused, and it wouldnt involve dropping.

UNCASVILLE, Conn. – went into Sunday’s matchup with fourth-ranked Ohio State knowing that Thomas was the Buckeyes’ prime option. The Huskies left still aware of that fact, but without any answers as to how to stop him.
The Huskies (2-2) hung around much of the game with one of the premier teams in the country before losing, 77-66, in the finals of the Hall of Fame Tip-off tournament at Mohegan Sun Arena in front of a smattering of fans Sunday.
Thomas, a left-hander with range and funk in his game, dominated the first half. The preseason All-American can make 3-pointers, has a jump hook and doesn’t mind a 15-footer.
Washington assigned 6-foot-6 Scott Suggs to Thomas, rather than 6-foot-10 Jernard Jarreau or 6-foot-7 Desmond Simmons, at the outset, thinking Thomas was more of a perimeter player. Two minutes, 5 seconds into the game, Thomas had seven points. He hit his first five shots on his way to 21 points in the first half. Washington countered with 31 of its own.
That give-and-take left Washington in a 41-31 deficit at intermission. It would get no closer than five points the rest of the way.
When Washington cut it to 44-39 in the second half, Thomas pushed Ohio State back in front by 10 with a swift personal 5-0 run on his way to 31 total points.
Thomas’ scoring flurry was supplemented by the precision of Ohio State point guard Aaron Craft, who went about his work with the meticulous approach of a clock builder. Craft has played 107 minutes in three games for the Buckeyes (3-0) this season had,” said C.J. Wilcox, who led Washington with 18 points. “We started to in the second half, and by that time it was too late.”
Washington could also look at its own poor execution. The Huskies missed three layups in the second half and finished with 13 turnovers against.

Fishery managers from Washington and Oregon on Wednesday set 2013 fishing seasons for the lower Columbia River that anticipate a smaller return of spring chinook salmon. Most new fishing rules adopted at the meeting take effect March 1.
After three years of strong returns, fishery managers based harvest guidelines for this year’s spring chinook season on a projected run of 141,400 upriver fish, about 25 percent below the 10-year average. Approximately 203,000 fish destined for areas above Bonneville Dam returned to the Columbia last year.
This year.
SALTWATER
Beaches: The next razor clam dig will run Thursday-Feb. 12 at Twin Harbors. Long Beach will be open for digging Friday-Feb. 10; Copalis and Mocrocks will be open Friday-Feb. 9. No digging will be allowed at any beach before noon. The evening low tide times are: Thursday, 4:22 p.m., -0.5 feet; Friday 5:11 p.m., -0.9 feet; Feb. 9, 5:56 p.m., -1.0 feet; Feb. 10, 6:37 p.m., -0.9 feet; Feb. 11, 7:17 p.m., -0.5 feet; and Feb. 12, 7:54 p.m., 0 feet.
Fly fishing: Fishing for resident coho has been off and on in the Tacoma Narrows. Searun cutthroat fishing has been good in some spots in marine areas 11 and 13. This also is a good time to try to hook a blackmouth from the beach at night.
North Sound: The San Juans remain the hot spot. Troll at 2 mph with just about any Silver Horde lures about four feet behind a flasher right on the bottom. Some of the keepers are running more than 15 pounds. Should make for an interesting Roche Harbor Salmon Classic that opens Friday.
South Sound: Marine Area 11 reopened to fishing Friday. There is plenty of bait around, so people should be able to find some blackmouth.
LAKES
American: The rainbow trout action remains fair to good. People are reporting consistent catches of fish measuring 12-14 inches. Yellow Power Eggs or Power Bait fished off the bottom remains the popular bait choice.
Chelan: Anglers are catching lake trout in the deep water above the Yacht Club and in the indeterminate flat below Wapato Point. Silver Horde’s Kingfisher Lite spoons in orange splatterback glow, Mack’s Lures Cha Cha Squidders and Silver Horde’s Ace Hi Flies baited with a piece of northern pikeminnow all have been effective. Troll at speeds of 1.2-1.7 mph with you gear within 5 feet of the bottom.
Roses: Ice anglers are using a variety of baits to catch some chunky rainbows. Pautzke’s Firebait in American wildfire is a favorite. Try using a bare 1/16th ounce jig with these floating baits to keep them down. Vary your depth in the water column until you locate the fish.
RIVERS
Chehalis: The steelhead fishing has been fair to good in the stretch between the mouth of the Satsop River and Centralia.
Olympic Coast: River conditions are good, and even with more rain in the forecast, the steelhead fishing should be fair to good this weekend.
Skookumchuck: The steelhead fishing remains very slow.
Wenatchee: The river is tentatively scheduled to reopen for a fairly short steelhead fishery on Friday. The river has not been open since November and there are fresh fish moving into the system now.
Yakima: The river should be in good shape this weekend, having come down and cleared up. Look to get your stonefly nymphs, San Juan worms or streamers on the inside of corners and in slower pools of water.Contributors: Blake Merwin at Gig Harbor Fly Shop, Red’s Fly Shop, washingtonlakes.com, salmonuniversity.com, The Evening Hatch, Anton Jones of Darrell and Dad’s Family Guide Service, Art Tachell at Point Defiance Boathouse, state Department of Fish and Wildlife..

New D Street overpass lanes could ease traffic
Two lanes of the renovated State Route 543 truck route north from H Street to the border will be paved and open for traffic by July 19, according to assistant project engineer Patrick Fuller of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). That will allow north and south-bound traffic to be re-routed under the eastern half of the new D Street overpass, itself set to be completely open in late August.
The overpass consists of two bridges that meet where the highway’s north and south bound lanes once crossed D Street. Those lanes are being re-worked into ramps providing access for traffic between D St. and SR 543.
When the project is completed in 2008, two new southbound lanes and three northbound lanes will pass under the two new D Street bridges on either side of the center access ramps. The right-hand northbound lane will carry trucks through a new access driveway directly to a three-lane queuing area and dedicated truck customs crossing, something that’s expected to expedite traffic as well by separating the trucks from the non-commercial traffic
Imco Construction began removing dirt from under the eastern half of the D Street overpass last week, and once the paving and striping is done on the new lanes then they’ll begin working on removing the dirt under the west side of the overpass. Much of the traffic now being detoured through the Allan Street neighborhood will be able to stay on SR 543 for access to border businesses.
The project has fallen about a month behind the proposed schedule when work began last year, according to WSDOT project engineer Chris Damitio.
The project’s design calls for concrete paving from H Street north to the border because of its durability. Aside from running into some very large granite boulders that delayed the work, construction schedules are also subject to weather delays. “If we get a rain day, then that puts us one day behind,” he said.

WASHINGTON - Katie Sepich was a radiant beauty of 22, a graduate student at New Mexico State University, when she was brutally raped and strangled and her body set on fire in 2003. Despite DNA evidence, it took three years to identify Gabriel Avila as her killer. By then, he had committed other crimes.
Dwayne Jackson was 18 when he was convicted for a violent robbery in Las Vegas in 2001. Thanks to DNA evidence, he was imprisoned for nearly four years - until a laboratory error was discovered that revealed his innocence. In 2011, he won a $1.5 million settlement.
On Tuesday, those stories and others will resonate inside the Supreme Court, where the justices will be asked to rule on the use of DNA in law enforcement. At stake is the widespread police practice of taking DNA samples from people arrested but not yet convicted of serious crimes - a practice fueled in part by the persistent advocacy of Katie Sepich's parents.
If the justices rule later this year that it's constitutional, says Jayann Sepich, "I think the impact will be monumental, and I believe there will be a tremendous number of lives saved."
But civil liberties advocates worry that allowing police to take DNA samples before conviction increases the possibility of errors such as the one that stole four years of Jackson's young life. While DNA is effective in law enforcement, they say, it's also subject to contamination, misinterpretation, sample switches and outright fraud.
The justices should uphold the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, says New York University law professor Erin Murphy, and "not be so dazzled by the technology in question."
They weren't so dazzled by a GPS tracking device last year, holding that police could not attach it to a car in order to monitor a suspect's movements. Last week, the court split on two more Fourth Amendment cases, ruling that using a drug-sniffing dog with reasonable suspicion was OK, but executing a search warrant after a suspect has left his home was not.
Modern technology presents a problem, however, particularly for justices who try to adhere to the Constitution. The framers didn't have GPS or DNA to contend with in the late 18th century.
Last week, the court grappled with the patent rights of self-replicating soybeans. In April, justices will debate a breast cancer detection technology that comes from human genes.
In Maryland v. King, the justices will decide whether a law enforcement tool used since the 1990s to help states and the federal government solve crimes is constitutional. It was then that Louisiana became the first state to take DNA from those simply arrested on felony charges, but not convicted. A few more states followed, but the trickle became a flood after 2005, when a federal law allowed the states' cases to be uploaded to a national database.
New Mexico became the sixth state to pass the law in 2006, the same year that Katie Sepich's killer finally was charged with her murder. "It took three years, which were very agonizing years for the family," says New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, who prosecuted the case as district attorney at the time.
The statute was dubbed "Katie's Law." In the years since, Jayann and Dave Sepich have taken their cause nationwide, creating the organization DNA Saves to advocate for collection upon arrest. Today, more than half the states have passed their own laws, greatly expanding the number of DNA profiles available to law enforcement agencies in the national database.
"It's amazing that they have the strength and conviction to do this in the name of their daughter," Martinez says.
Last year, Congress passed the Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act, which President Obama signed last month. It creates a grants program to help states pay for the expanded system.
"It's the right thing to do," Obama said of taking DNA from arrestees in a 2010 appearance on America's Most Wanted. "This is where the national registry becomes so important."
The bolstered federal database has helped solve thousands of crimes by linking DNA evidence at old crime scenes to newly arrested people.
"Behind every number is a human story, a case in which a buccal swab sample collected from a felony arrestee played a crucial role in solving a violent crime," says a brief submitted by all 49 other states backing Maryland's law.
On the other side is Alonzo Jay King, who was arrested on assault charges in 2009. Police collected DNA from a simple cheek swab and matched it to a 2003 rape case, for which King then was convicted. The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed that decision, ruling that the cheek swab constituted a search without either a warrant or suspicion of another crime. Now the state, backed by the federal government, is challenging that ruling.
Kannon Shanmugam, the lawyer who will argue King's case in court Tuesday, contends the cheek swab was a bodily intrusion requiring a search warrant. Because there is no Supreme Court precedent on DNA, he says, the decision will be one of the court's most significant Fourth Amendment rulings in years.
"There are over 12 million arrests in the United States every year," Shanmugam's brief says. "Virtually all of the arguments advanced by petitioner and the United States would justify the blanket collection and retention of DNA from ordinary citizens."
Maryland argues that DNA is just an extension of fingerprinting and other tools for identifying suspects, "the Fourth Amendment legitimacy of which has never been seriously doubted."
But opponents note that taking DNA from people upon arrest is to help in other investigations, not to identify the person already under arrest. They fear the DNA swabs will lead to more false hits and wrongful convictions.
Advocates of the federal-state database say plenty of privacy safeguards exist. If the system works as it is supposed to, 13 DNA markers are uploaded, incapable on their own of providing sensitive genetic information. Only upon conviction is a second swab taken for further testing. If the arrested person is acquitted or the case thrown out, the DNA information is destroyed and the records expunged.
Jayann Sepich is so convinced the information is harmless that she includes hers on the back of her business card. "There's nothing on those 13 markers that discloses anything private," she says.
As for the merits of collecting DNA at felony arrests, Sepich says she became more convinced after reviewing the case of a California man arrested 21 times over 15 years without being convicted of a crime requiring a DNA swab. When he finally was convicted of rape, his DNA was matched to 12 other rapes and murders of women, dating to his first felony arrest.
"When I look at that list of names, I don't see names," Sepich says. "I see daughters, and I feel the heartbreak of their mothers who had to bury them."

DENVER - Legislation creating legal recognition and protections for couples regardless of gender in Colorado gained final approval Tuesday in the state Legislature.
Last year a similar bill on civil unions for gay couples with support from a handful of GOP representatives appeared poised to pass before leaders in the Republican-controlled House blocked it. In November, Democrats regained control of the House and designated Mark Ferrandino of Denver as Colorado's first openly gay House speaker.
Ferrandino sponsored civil unions legislation that failed each of the past two years and this year's successful version of the bill.
"It's about love. It's about family. It's about equality," he said.
Once the measure is signed, Colorado will join a dozen other states that have civil unions or similar laws.
The incarnation of the bill that passed does not include religious exemptions for adoption organizations that last year's proposal contained.
Opponents seized on that change and said they foresee legal challenges in court to that aspect of the legislation.
The bill passed 39-26 with each Democrat and two Republicans supporting it.
"The time has come," said Rep. Joann Ginal, a Fort Collins, Colo., Democrat who is openly gay. "Please support equality for everyone."
Rep. Cheri Gerou, a Republican from Evergreen, Colo., was one of the Republicans who voted in favor of the bill. She said the GOP missed its chance for compromise on religious exemptions when it blocked the civil unions vote last year.
The bill's approval marks a significant political shift in a western state that traditionally has had deep, conservative roots but has become more moderate in the past decade.
Colorado voters banned gay marriage seven years ago. That means civil unions are the only option in the state, but a U.S. Supreme ruling on gay marriage laws could change that.
Among the default rights that civil unions will extend to gay couples under Colorado law would be medical decisions for partners, hospital and jail visitation privileges, property succession rights through inheritance, joint adoption and provisions for dissolution of a relationship, including division of property and shared responsibility for and visitation of children.

11.14 Road construction projects schedule — may delay traffic

Reflections from ASPO: Contradiction, EROI, and Future Energy Supplies

One subscribe.
This is precisely why we need to engage the brain trusts at the USGS and places like the Colorado School of Mines, especially when the ASPO circus comes to town. These people are our acedemic leaders, movers and shakers.
This is "economic geology". Anyone wonder what "economic geology" really is? What flavor of economics? Isn't "economic geology" a contradiction? A word salad?
Why not engage top geologists in their field - how about top "economic" geologists? Get one of them to explain the "economics" perhaps?...
Try flipping through a copy of "Economic Geology". Lots of good geology (science) but wheres the "economics"?
Um! First off there are other schools than Colorado School of Mines that some of us might suggest are at least as good, if not, by some measures better. Secondly economic geology is largely what the title suggests. It teaches how to assess how much of the valuable ore is there and, depending on who is teaching it, it may get into some geostatistics, which helps predict based on current known locations and grades of ore, where to look for more.
I'm thinking that, since the Denver ASPO was in Denver, then some of the local stars could have shown up.
Here is a list of officers and editors at "Economic GEology"
Some of these folks are local to any Denver event. Lets task them.
As to CSM, not only are the extremely local to any Denver event, they make this claim:
I think if such an influential institution is going to make such extrordinary claims, they have to back it up.
Try walking onto the CSM campus, even into the brand new petroleum building and asking where the M. King Hubbert Center for Petroleum Studies is.
A few years back I spent a Sunday afternoon in the CSM library and found that they had no hard copies of the Hubbert Center Newsletter. I did leave notes suggesting that it be added to their collection.
I think PDV and Robert have a point here. The field does seem to be more about exploitation of resources rather than stewardship. If somebody in the research area had actually wanted to or had the charter to, they could have done an impartial study of resource depletion based on some rather simple models. The fact that a branch of this field is called "geostatistics" makes one think that somebody must be doing original research.
But then you find that a web-site exists called .
The guy who runs the site says the specialty of geostatistics consists of "voodoo statistics" and "scientific fraud". Granted, it looks like this is mainly in the context of mineral mining and perhaps petroleum extraction is not really a part of this field, but it makes you wonder what exactly constitutes research.
I am curious what HO thinks about these charges. Here is a sample:
Wht,
Whoever wrote the quote "degrees ...investors" must be an idiot.There is no way that aggregation of words can be read in any way that makes any sense at all.
I don't know about the idiot part. Yet, it indeed does kind of read like William Faulkner if Faulkner had an engineering degree.
Actually the guy writes in a mix of very active voice and some passive constructions. See the language E'prime:
I usually can spot E'Prime writers and to me they make perfect sense because every subject has an action and the writer leaves no ambiguity as to who said what. This guy doesn't quite make the grade -- he appears to try, yet it comes out too flowery.
I wrote more here on the junk science:
I leave you with more of this guy's genius takedown:
"valuable ore"
How do you define "valuable"? one ounce of crystaline Au vs one ounce of crystaline H20 vs one ounce of phosphorous. Which one is more "valuble"? in terms of "money" or ..? What brand of economics will you rely on to asses the value of your ore, Hobbsian? Keynsian? Miltonian? Malthusian? Hall? Will you adhere to zero-sum or will you hoard? I think "economic geology" is a word salad. "Economics" has become "politics". That is why there is no "economics" IN "Economic Geology", outside perhaps some politics.
We need to work on our "system" of "valuation"; our "priorities" if you will.
We've covered this point before but it might bear repeating for those that missed the discussion.
Emphatic truth: there are hundreds of TCF of NG in the shale gas plays in the US. First, my model estimates we can recover, with existing technology, over 120 TCF of NG from these plays. Second, my model estimates we can recover, with existing technology, 10 TCF of NG from these plays. Both of these statements are undeniably true. No one deny the accuracy of my model. It is a proven methodology.
Of course, both model results are based on a set of assumptions. All the assumptions in both models are identical. Except one: the anticipated price of NG. The first model assumes $25/mcf. The second assumes $5/mcf. No geologist or engineer can argue against my model. One can choose different price structures but this is an assumptive factor and you cannot argue its validity. It is an assumption...not a prediction.
As been said before: any projection of the recovery of any commodity that does not include the associated price assumptions is a meaningless value and does not merit discussion IMHO. Mr. Mello may be right about there being 500 billion bbls of oil in the various DW trends. I see no point in debating its validity. Just accept such numbers because they are meaningless to a degree. The question is: how much of that oil is recoverable? Easy to answer actually (if you first assume that oil is actually out there). Just run an economic model using the appropriate cost estimates. And then vary the assumptive price of that future oil. At $300/bbl the recoverable reserves from these plays could be hundreds of billions of bbls (again, if they actually exist). And at $50/bbl the number could be a couple of billion bbls. And both model outcomes are correct and undeniable because they are models with price assumptions...not price predictions.
My analysis has no bearing on Mr. Mello's model predicting the existence of this oil. That's another model I assume he's generated. This analysis has no bearing on anyone's model for predicting the future price of oil either. The conversation gets very messy when we try to discuss validity when the different models are lumped together to extract a prediction. We tend to lose sight of the trees for the forest IMO. I haven't been able to review all the presentations at the conference. But from what others have posted I see no obvious contradictions in as much I haven't seen the underlying assumptions.
ROCKMAN, I really appreciate your no nonsense clear explanations.
A few years ago I had the opportunity to work with a software company that marketed a high end scientific graphics application with advanced capabilities including GIS, CGM, Seismic data analysis (PIP), to both major and minor players in the Petroleum Industry, I had many geologists and Landsmen as customers. I often had to trouble shoot their data files so I saw a lot of proprietary information. I wish many more of them had had your grasp of the bigger picture. It might have saved them a lot of headaches.
You're welcome FM. I'm not so sure it's a better grasp of the "big picture" as it is a different perspective. I tease westexas about being a crazy wildcatter. But you have to give those guys a lot of credit: stand up in front of someone and recommend they spend $10 million to drill a well that will probably be a dry hole. And then drill a dry hole and go back and ask for another $10 million to drill another prospect. Got to have nerves of steel (and complete lack of shame genes) to play that game. Explorationist have to have unbridle optimism to take on Mother Earth every day. I work on the development geology/engineering side of the fence and thus deal with more concrete data. Thus I have a much clearer picture of what is real and what's not...unlike westexas.
Interesting you bring this up. I'm starting to realize that there is such a thing as a EROEI for money.
Often this wall is viewed as inflation. For example flooding the US with cheap credit over the last decade primarily drove up housing prices. Perfectly good homes and decent shelter became a multiples of its former value. Very little real increase in wealth was created while the notational debt ballooned.
Deep down underlying all of this there seems to be a sort of law of economics and energy.
You cannot expand using lower value more expensive resources without going into debt.
As usual for me asserted without proof but think about it.
If NG was at 25 vs 5 and we wanted to keep the precentage costs devoted to energy constant then in the 25 dollar case the economy would have to be five times larger than in the five dollar case. How do you do that ?
The only way to do this if resources are getting more scarce and expensive is to expand the amount of debt in the system to allow it to grow.
The hope of course is that this new larger economy will create new ways to create wealth (computers) and this new wealth will offset the decline in resource quality. In general however it also creates bubbles which make this sort of growth very inefficient requiring even more debt.
Nate Hagens explains this as chaining many low EROEI sources together i.e instead of one 100:1 source you have several say 10:1 sources. As long as the resource base is large the decline in EROEI does not look all that bad. However you still have to grow to keep the magnitude of the extra effort constant. Exploiting a larger base of lower value resources requires growth !
There is a saying that came out of the .com era that we will sell at a loss and make it up in volume.
Thats exactly the game you have to play as you use the infrastructure developed with high EROEI resources to exploit lower value EROEI resources. However no matter what you do the debt side continues to grow.
Assuming you start with no debt or even a significant pile of wealth and that some of the growth does capture real value i.e the expanding economy esp with technical advance does indeed innovate then the expansion of debt can be done for a long long time as resources become depleted and more expensive.
But it turns out your simply delaying the end. The only real answer or way out is to develop viable alternatives as it becomes obvious that debt expansion is taking place. Literally the moment that its clear growth is impossible without expanding the debt you have to stop and pour resources into bootstrapping other energy sources.
We actually did this but only partially with our expansion into coal and NG and it helped for a while but these are also finite and eventually started slipping down their own EROEI curve. And the rate at which debt increased increased.
Well it turns out that money actually is not infinite it can't pretend to create wealth via expanding the debt forever eventually you have a run on the bank as it dawns on people that very very very few will ever get repaid. Expanding debt is a confidence game and when it fails the system fails.
This is important because it means our economic system has not been viable for decades. Trying to use our economic model to predict the reserves available from low quality resources is useless.
Instead we will extract what we can as long as we can expand debt without a run on the bank but our real resource base capable of creating real wealth was used up decades ago we have been out of true resources for a very long time.
Not only is there nothing left we exhausted the resource base useful for real expansion without debt expansion decades ago. All thats left now is to see how long we can go before the debt bubble implodes on itself.
Once this happens then the actual resource base is minute so much lower than our current assumptions as to be treated as zero. Although small what can be exploited it may or may not be valuable but it will if extracted at all be extracted under a completely different economic system that has no bearing with the current one.
Of course we managed to live in a dreamworld for so long that its now practically impossible for people to wake up and realize what we have done. For many of us this means the world we grew up in was already toast back when we where children or teenagers. Its all we know and for most they simply can't accept that its been a lie the entire time.
From now on out given we seem to be in the end stage of the debt bubble declining resources will only hasten the speed at which we collapse further attempts to grow to utilize more expensive resources will do the same.
Checkmate.
Good explanation.
How does price volatility play into your recoverability through barrel price model?
This includes the assumption will be seeing a lot more volatility in the future as well - at least after a real economic recovery starts.
With my limited experience, project financing managers hate volatility more than anything, because it throws their payback calculations around like a dead rat in a washing machine.
What's your take on this?
Good question. I'd argue the volatility is itself the signal the system is already in collapse mode.
The whale oil papers show this.
However be careful about assumptions using the past to predict the future. The only certain thing you can take away is that volatility is a key signal to the start of collapse past that the evolution of the system is really really hard to guess.
I guess other people guess one of the guesses will be right but the truth cannot be known until after the fact.
One could argue the Roman Empire was doomed the day the republic ended but the longest measure has it ending after Constantinople fell. Even then a fair amount of absorption took place into the new Moslem Empire and back into the older Barbarian empires of the west.
Or it can crash fast like the Soviet Union with a fair number of people actually born before and living after its existence. So and empire rose and fell in the span of a human lifetime or Franco's Spain or Mao's China.
If you notice the pace has quickened then it stands to reason a Roman like centuries long fall is probably not going to happen.
Price and money itself are going to be wrapped up in a mix of volatility and the rate of actual collapse.
As far as I can tell I expect intervals of low prices where collapse itself has ensured supply meets demand will be short. Obviously we managed to have one such event happen although it already seems to be starting to end.
Its not clear at all that the circumstances will result in another such event. Maybe but again depending on how you model maybe not.
Obviously my model is pretty simple we enter a period of stronger and stronger price increases for oil and NG and the system tries to keep from collapsing via ever more rapid expansion of debt but implodes. I don't see us making it through the next one and I also feel that from here on out attempts to keep the system together will generally only cause it to deteriorate even faster. Way way to many bombs or landmines or what have you are now armed with hair triggers littering the ground and also pressure triggers ready to go if anything goes.
So what I see is volatility on a rising trend then as some point maybe in the very near future a rapid surge in oil prices and a bit later on NG and then a new event not yet seen where the fiat currencies begin to collapse sending prices even higher in addition to whatever changes in production rate are causing. From that point on who knows the system is in a death spiral. If I'm right both about the price spike and it initiating a fiat money collapse then its one and done.
Theoretically the US could avert such a event by rapidly increasing interest rates and rapidly reducing the money supply and hopefully not collapse because of the resulting defaults. This should moderate energy prices if not initiate another price collapse and we could potentially sort of slide along the bottom for quite sometime in a deep depression. However given the quick way prices rebounded after our last collapse its note even clear if this will really work. There may be no bottom to the whole even going this way.
Or of course my assumptions are wrong we have more rope left but this simply means we will continue BAU undulating between those two extreme outcomes for a bit longer before finally picking one of the paths. I'd argue that outside of my extreme view its really really hard to guess what happens as some fairly slight difference can lead to longer term changes. This of course signals that if we are not yet at the point of collapse right now then the system is chaotic effectively tumbling between the extremes without falling into them on a very unpredictable path.
By chaotic what I mean is that the problems we face may not cause collapse but they may cause the system to change course fairly dramatically over a fairly short period of time as its in a sense trying to dodge between the two certain collapse scenarios. This almost certainly means extreme volatility with prices. Think of a ship sinking with the passengers running back and forth from one side to another rocking the boat. Which way it finally rolls depends on a very subtle change in sink rate and where the passengers are but the boat rocking game is not changing the outcome.
Of course volatility on this scale is itself very stressful so its tough to believe that even this won't fail fast probably with only a short delay.
Hopefully you can see the role volatility plays once the system becomes unstable and volatile its really hard to come up with a way to dampen it in such a way that you don't end up in collapse.
As and example the great homebuyer tax credit simply created another foreclosure bomb thats literally going off even as its working.
Here it is
Given median home prices and base cost of living issues and the fact we are now in a weak to declining economy this is simply creating a bomb that in my opinion will start going off before the ink dries on the last credit request.
I suspect a significant number of these loans are already delinquent with many buyers losing their jobs shortly after purchase others quickly hitting the wall as they are in over there heads. Expect credit card defaults to rise sharply with this program.
So not only do I not think this program helped in my opinion it actually accelerated the collapse process esp given its pulled forward demand from people that might have been able to purchase a house in a few years or months if they got their personal financial houses in order.
Also it certainly accelerated the fall in rents as these people where renters. Moving them to vacant houses they cannot afford not only did not solve anything it made matters worse the moment it had enough of a effect to cause macro economic changes.
And this is just one of a long long list of things happening now that not only lead to larger longer term problems but cause and almost immediate short term problems to accelerate.
Heck the 0% interest rate for example has ignited a carry trade on the US dollar.
Pension funds, Commercial real estate ??? The list is endless.
Given this and even assuming I'm remotely close or even just Westexas's export land then one in done seems obvious.
If I'm closer to correct it just means we have a 50 megaton nuclear explosion going off instead of a 10.
Given most of us are at ground zero I'm not sure the difference matters.
Oh I forget Pruis's and plugin EV's windmills and NG powered diesel trucks are going to save the day nothing to worry about. All I can figure is they must work just as well driving over radioactive glass as they do on asphalt.
Sam -- Excellent point. In the basic economic model the industry follows you enter a price deck. A starting price with, perhaps, some inflation built in. The starting point is always close to current pricing. If we're in a high price period we'll tend to use a lower number. But seldom use a higher number in a low price period. The economic model uses the recoverable reserve model to supply an asset volume. It's not uncommon to give this volume a "hair cut" to allow a more conservative out come. So such a model might yield a ROR of 7 to 1. Now this is where it can be a little confusing to outsiders. We then consider the probability of success of the project. Two projects can have identical ROR but one has a PS of 80% and the other a PS of 20%. Yes...some risk adjustment within the ecomodel but that's just a "shading effort". Obviously one would chose the higher PS project if these are your only two choices. What you seldom see (on paper, anyway) is the price volatility risk you mention. I've seen as many companies fail as a result of price volatility as drilling too many dry holes. As you imply, a project might be a technical success but the company fails because it doesn't receive the anticipated price. The recent shale gas play is a great example. My client was one of the most successful players. But that success turned into an anchor that nearly sunk them when NG prices collapsed. In fact, their exploration model exceeded expectations a little. In 34 years I've seen many different efforts to risk a project. I have never once seen a price collapse used in any evaluation. Make sense though: would you climb out of bed this morning if your model showed you getting hit by a bus today. And why would you put all of your 401k into the stock market if you anticipated a market crash? Oh...yeah...that greed motivation thing.
This gets to the root of the point I was trying to make elsewhere. The reserve recovery models are not predictions of how much oil/NG WILL be found or IF the effort will be profitable. They are just geological models based upon a set of assumptions. The ecomodel doesn't predict how much oil/Ng will be found or if there will be a profit. It just offers a ROR based upon the assumptions made. Now there is a whole different world of models one can construct to PREDICT the future price of oil/NG. And models to PREDICT how much oil/NG might exist in a region. I know these sound like subtle differences but to the oil industry they are easily separated. Dr. Mello may have a geologic model indicating 500 billion bbls of oil. And it may be a very sound model. But such models typically don't include the probability factor. Dr. Mello might characterize the PS of his 500 billion bbl model as 10% or 90%. But that won't change the model...it's still 500 billion bbls of oil. And this is where I see us often debating apples and oranges. I might have no problem accepting the validity of Dr. Mello's 500 billion bbls model if I saw the details. But I can offer that there's not a freaking chance those bbls will ever be produced. Two different questions... two different answers... apples and oranges.
Thanks! I think I get the gist your argument about how hard it is to value Dr Mello's assessment. I'd also take a wild guess that he couldn't reveal his cost estimation and profitability calculations even if he wanted. And I don't think he wants.
Coming back to your point about volatility assessment. In the energy utility trade price volatility is of course part of the daily bread and butter - not that they necessarily do it great either (most of them use Black-Scholes formula derivations for their options hedging strategies - not the most robust approach out there as last yeas have shown, but allows one to fall back on the 'gold standard' excuse if things fail). Regardless, they do make an attempt to factor it in - especially since 2007.
Now, why don't the upstream players use volatility hedging cost estimation as part of their projected costs? Would it be too prohibitive? Would it result in the 'why get out of bed' outcome in too many cases? Or is it because historically it has been such a small factor compared to the PS you refer to? If the latter, I think people ought to start re-evaluating their historical position on that. Then again, who am I to tell them that.
And yes, in the end, recoverability is what we are all interested in. My second wild guess would be that one way or the other, we'll end up pumping oil through genuinely loss making activities for quite some time in the future. Price externalities are a useful invention in that regard. But that's another topic, for another time.
sam -- I suppose the short answer is that you can't hedge what you haven't found yet. Most companies hedge,to some degree, on the existing production. I've never seen an operator work hedging into the drilling economics. And, as we both know, hedging can hurt your revenue stream as well as help.
No..I think price shocks (especially on the order of a Black Swan) are one of the biggest unconsidered risks in the economic evaluation in some type of plays. In a conventional play a dry hole loses money regardless of the price of oil/NG. I've seen many operators talk themselves into drilling poor prospects because of high price expectations. Doesn't matter if oil is selling for $120/bbl if you're plugging a $148 million dry hole (something I watched first hand last year in the DW GOM).OTOH, in plays like the shale gas where you have a high probability of making a well operators used high NG price expectations to justify those high lease/drilling/completion costs. Thus even when they found the NG they were drilling for, the eventual low prices broke their backs.
Given that NG seems to have bottomed out it looks like we will actually find out what happens next.
My own experience is investors hate volatility. They don't mind risk so much if the risk and rewards can be understood if inflated. They are used to everyone inflating the upside. This is in software which is a very volatile business esp for smaller startups. Always has been one reason investors got wiped out in the .com crash is they walked into a very volatile business they did not understand and thought it was always going up. They found out later.
Also and a lot of people don't realize a lot of the money lost was with established companies telecoms software companies etc. The actual amount lost at the start ups was substantially lower. However after the boom investment dries up in the startup area and from experience in a matter of days if not hours. Investors try to extract their money and generally kill the companies. The only thing worse than a company run by a incompetent management team is one run by a incompetent management team and incompetent investors. Generally the turn around artists are really people who managed to kill companies that had strong business's but short term cash flow issues and extract money in the process.
In the whole process the concept of actually making a product people want and selling it and making money seldom if every enters the picture.
After this you get the big shake out but more important you never ever get capitol input at near the level it was during the big boom. Maybe if you wait decades it might come again but don't hold your breath. Thats not to say you can't raise money but its what I call cautious capitol and it takes a long time to strike a balance as the new risk factors or realistic risk factors are determined via experiment for the most part. For the software industry most of the investment capitol for startups is now coming from successful .com's and venture capitol firms in the last boom.
They of course think they are smart realistically for the most part they just got lucky. Regardless they put the money in.
I don't see any reason why the shale plays won't follow this same model it seems to be a basic one for boom/bust business cycles. This means of course that your in a bit of a catch 22 since investors will be slow to invest in general and want to see handsome profits before expanding their investment which means shale development will probably slow down substantially.
Now of course at this point what happens next depends on the product. In software we have a sort of analog to shale its the bazillion social networking sites some make it some don't most of the time they get big fast then fall off just as fast as something new comes along. In a sense the group of people willing to support the next cool thing is finite so they effectively steal each others customers the actual customer base grows slowly. The twitter guys are not using facebook as much any more etc.
I don't know the shale business well enough but my guess is its more about investors the investors willing to invest are a finite group now and the shale players will compete for them.
Next these investors are not just seeking profit they are seeking maximum profit to justify the current investment. In general further investment will come for the profits of the current round. Pretty much just like software where the investment money is driven by the few profitable companies the survived the .com era.
And its smart and scared money a whiff of volatility and its gone.
I think the overall investment side is probably going to be pretty close to what I've seen and it will certainly be interesting to see how it interacts with the shale plays.
I've said for a long time that I think that they will provide a slow and steady stream of NG once both the business model matures and the development of shale itself matures.
For shale at least given that conventional NG plays are declining the issue becomes LNG imports obviously if LNG imports under price shale then no shale development. This is similar to the relationship between North American oil production and imports. Its expensive today to produce oil in North America and development is pretty much controlled by the global price. This obviously slows things down. And the big oil bust is a reminder of that.
My opinion is not a lot really happens until our NG prices stabilize with global NG prices. Enough LNG is being exported today to ensure that the NA market is not longer isolated its just a matter of when prices reach the point you have liquidity. The software industry has an analog in the form of outsourcing.
This suggest that longer term NA shale won't really expand until its competitive with LNG from other sources.
However given the nature of the plays one has to wonder what the world is like when shale is one of the better plays to expand. Of course there are some large discounts that change matters but still.
So overall assuming the business and financial model follows what happened in software you simply can expect much from shale for the foreseeable future. It will be developed as it makes sense but the bulk probably won't really be exploited until global LNG supplies become a issue.
We have another example and that the Venezuela heavy oil deposits and the Canadian tar sands at some point in both cases they are or will eventually be exploited at some steady but relatively low rate vs the resource base and they probably will remain there until they are closer to the only choice and all other choices are reaching exhaustion.
Given that as NG prices go up LNG is likely to expand steadily increasing the liquidity of the NG markets and globalizing them shale ..
And of course this means the global economy will eventually have to absorb higher NG prices until the market becomes very fungible if you will and my opinion on that happening at the global level is its questionable and I'll leave it at that.
I agree memmel. It's difficult to be optimistic about SG activity regaining anywhere near its former level anytime soon...maybe never (never being in 10 years or so). As far as private investors sources for SG I'm not sure they played a big role. The big SG players were big public companies. Their investors, per se, were the bankers extending them credit. I suspect that source will return very slowly to the mix.
We won't get anywhere close to SG. In fact, we won't even drill for lower quality conventional NG reservoirs. Fortunately for us there are viable NG plays with high quality/high flow rate reservoirs. And even more fortunately there is little competition for such prospects. If NG were selling for $10/mcf right now we probably could buy just 10% of the deals we've taken. And they would have cost more to acquire and drill.
As the man said...it's good to be King.
If you have the money then I see no reason for it not to be a lucrative area for a long time.
Even in end of the world type scenarios you have to have X amount of NG if you don't want to end in the stone age.
The difference between maintaining BAU and keeping things from collapse is huge. All kinds of intermediate possibilities exist.
Markets for natural gas and oil will exist as long as they can be supplied once you give up on "cheap" NG for the mass market use cases we have today plenty of demand remains which means supply. There is reasonable demand for NG well out the price curve. Bottled propane for cooking is sold at a nice profit all over the world for example.
In economics you have the velocity of money which is the number of transactions occurring. What I see going forward is decent low "velocity" demand for NG well into the future barring complete economic collapse. Its not going to build to offset falling oil supplies simply because we cannot afford it. BAU is dead but multiple niche markets less price insensitive can and probably will drive a more sedate but stable NG market or likely markets. One has to think that a return to vertical integration may become important with NG developed buy unified utilities that also balance with say wind or other alternative energy sources or coal or nuclear. Or fertilizer manufactures will move to directly control NG production etc.
What I saw in the third world was that companies tended to be vertically integrated or horizontally split on intrinsic market divides what one would call natural markets. I.e your typical village market. Loss of a fairly open market for bulk sale of NG does not mean you won't have vertical customers and direct sale markets. I consider both natural markets in the absence of open exchanges and the ability to mesh NG sales across countries and even the world via LNG.
The end of BAU suggest we would probably see the end of these national and international meshed markets however "natural markets" remain and price supply demand all work like they always have.
There won't be a price for NG like we have today just like there was no global price for salt back in the old days or any other commodity price will vary and the ability to transport enough product between markets to level prices will be limited but this means of course just as the salt caravans of old made steady profits century after century the NG industry should as long as the demand remains and supply is reasonably there.
So if you think about it as a fundamental change in how NG is marketed and sold then the strange situation of high prices not resulting in rapid expansion of production makes sense. The markets are localized and these more local markets constrain the situation. Lacking a large growing market there is simply no reason for supply and demand to not find its equilibrium at some price point and it does not have to be a infinite growth solution others are viable and work.
So to be clear when I suggest like I did in a previous post that there is no market for 25 dollar NG I mean there is no meshed NG market like what we have now. Instead there are fragmented markets some working on 2 dollar NG some on 50 or 100 NG many on none. The volume of NG produced is significantly lower than today but its simply different and works under different rules and its hard to even guess how things will play out.
And I suspect ROCKMAN will profit handsomely off of this :)
Investors well eventually some will win but probably many lose in the process but thats what happens with investment.
memmel -- I had not thought about vertical integration for a while. Back in the late 70's that became all the rage for the utility/pipeline companies. They bought into NG drilling programs as a working interest partner and, in some cases, actually started their own prospect generator shops. With very few exceptions they were slaughtered. Combination of two simple factors: NG exploration wasn't their specialty and, more importantly, they couldn't tell good operators from the wolves who were more than ready and willing to exploit their ignorance and slaughter them on the spot. I worked with Transco P/L back in those days. Poster child for what I'm describing. In one joint venture they bought into 18 NG drilling projects from an independent operator. Result: 18 dry holes and the principal players for the operator retired millionaires. It's easy to imagine these events repeating themselves when the end users once again see the "benefit" of vertical integration. Like any good idea it all hangs on the execution and not the validity of the plan.
My $25/mcf value was obviously a gross over statement of where prices could go. Just part of the absurdity, IMO, of undue expectations of the SG plays being the great PO solution. As you say, big variance from local market to market. What I'm focused on right now is how to deal/benefit from the absurdly short cycles should they persist. When I started 34 years ago the boom/bust cycles were on the order of 10 to 15 years. Just look at the last 2 years: oil -- $50 - $147 - $38 - $75. We stared our program thinking in terms of hitting the liquidation phase in 4 or 5 years. Now I'm thinking in terms of 18 to 24 months. And then would require us to drill even faster. And that also means ramping up exposure that much quicker. And that often leads to failure. My cohorts and I will benefit handsomely if we get it right. And we will be dumped in a heartbeat if we don't perform adequately. That's the deal and we were all happy to let our abilities determine our outcome.
Pretty much every analysis I've seen recently indicates that short term there is about a $5 cap on North American gas and a low end around $3 - $4 that LNG still can't displace simply because there are competing markets and not really enough regas facilities in the US. The shale gas players have been responding by lower costs....the breakeven for Haynesville is now around $2.50 for Marcellus around $3 as compared to an average for North American conventional gas of around $7/Mcf. Continued low prices will cause greater efficiencies but certainly you will see additions only from the best or Tier 1 acreage of the various shale plays. Gas will get shutin as the hedges roll off (a lot of companies are still well hedged) and eventually the price will rise again towards the marginal cost of conventional gas at which point the shale gas plays will ramp up once again. The company I work for is projecting $6/mcf long term, consistent from what I've seen from CERA. A lot of companies can make hay at this price in shale gas plays, specifically those that have learned the manufacturing approach.
Rock, after all the knobs are turned, what you really have is some sort of curve, ulimate recoverable reserves versus (inflation adjusted) price. But of course both geologic and technical assumptions went into making that curve.
So we have multiple sources of uncertainty: What is really under the ground? How much will the market pay to extract it? How tough (expensive) will extraction of X percent cost?
enemy -- So true. I could never document the number but, based upon my personal experience over 34 years, there has been more money invested in oil/NG then has ever been recovered. Thanks to optimism/greed I've had a career.
Maybe I'm missing something but I'll ask anyway:
You say 'with current technology we can recover' but does that mean we can recover that much with a positive EROI or just that we can get the gas out the rock if we want too but with a negative EROI for the last bit?
We know there is still a lot of FF in the earths crust, as is e.g. uranium. But if we use these resources mainly for burning it to get energy, then recovering it has only any use if the EROI is (at least) several times larger then 1. Can we still get the 120 TCF of shale gas out? Same with the 500 billion barrels of oil between S. America and Africa?
Also, the EROI only applies to the situation where we burn the resource. For other uses like production of plastics and other products it's only the monetary ROI that counts right?
Styno -- I can't answer you in terms of EROI. The oil industry never has and will never base drilling decisions on EROI. Not that there isn't a relationship. But we just deal in $'s. The NG is there in the SG plays. Whether it's 100 or 80 or 120 TCF I don't really know. But there is a huge amount PROVEN IN PLACE NG. And current technology can recover all of it. The big IF, of course, is IF the price is high enough. And it might well reach a point when the profit to do so is there but you might actually have a negative EROI. But I don't think such a time, if it ever did occur, would persist very long.
The 500 billion bbls in the Atlantic is a whole different story. I still haven't seen Dr. Mello's complete presentation but I'll stick my neck out and say he doesn't have specific data showing that amount of oil exists out there. I take it his number comes from a model. IOW, what could be out there. That number may be right or off by 300 billion bbls...time will tell. And, again, not knowing the details, even if that's his estimate of the amount of oil out there that could be produced his number is totally bogus if he doesn't include a pricing assumption. Just like shale gas, the 100 TCF recoverable number is only valid at a certain price assumption. But to be practical I see no potential for NG prices to reach $25/mcf (2009 $'s) and stay at that price long enough to cause a sufficient number of wells to be drilled to recover anywhere near that volume of NG. The economic feedback loop is just way too efficient these days.
Thank you for your insight and time.
So what is the likely EROEI of Mr Mello's 500 BBL secret? I watched his presentation on video, and I have to say, high marks for showmanship. For the sake of the peak oil crowd, he made a big deal about being conservative in his estimates.
Jeremy Gilbert said the very next morning that we would be lucky to get 10 billion barrels out. As for the EROI, I am not sure, but we might be working on that in the not to distant future...
David -- As per my thoughts above did Mr.Gilbert offer a price assumption for his 10 billion bbl of oil prediction?
Rockman,
No, he did not. He was acknowledging the fact that Mr. Mello was reporting resources in existence, not proved reserves, to which Mr. Gilbert said might be about 10 billion.
But I think the situation is more complicated than you discuss. I agree that in the "net present value" sense that the price of oil will determine what is recoverable and what is not - economically speaking. However, you are assuming that all of the resources, financial and otherwise, are available to these firms as long as the price signal says that they will make a profit.
I get your point David. But my economic model makes no assumptions "that all of the resources, financial and otherwise, are available". That's the point I was trying to make. This is where we can get lost in our conversation. My model isn't dependent upon the factors you mention because my model isn't a prediction of what will or won't happen. It's just a model...not reality. Your factors are critical, of course. But they would be projected based upon other models: future capital availability model, future political model, future consumption model, etc. All such models could be used to predict future conditions. But, by in large, each model is independent of each other. My hypothetical model is valid whether there is every another $ to spend drilling wells. As I said, it's just a model...not a prediction of the future.
As I was trying to imply we have a tendency to debate models when we're really debating what appears to be predictions used in these models. That's why I struggle to make the distinction in our conversations between assumptions and predictions. You cannot argue that someone's model assumptions are wrong. But we can vigorously debate whether one prediction or another is correct. In Dr. Mello's case if he has a model that shows 500 billion bbls of oil then it's 500 billion bbls of oil. We can discuss if he's staying within the realm of geologic reality or not. But if he predicts that we will prove up 500 billion bbls then that's a completely different matter. Perhaps I come to the subject with a very prejudiced view. I look at proposed drilling projects daily and it's very easy for me to judge a project's model as being valid but the reject the deal because it doesn't have a chance of working. For me models and predictions exist in two different worlds. I hope that makes sense.
Rockman,
I understand the difference between assumptions and predictions and I agree with your general opinion, i.e. assumptions should not be argued over. But we are fundamentally asking different questions, though. You are answering the question in your model: "how much of a resource can we get, based on assumptions of X price for natural gas?" I am asking how much of that gas will be gained at a significant energy profit? That is a much different question.
Also, models are defined as a simplification of a real system (Hall and Day 1977). Your model is a simplified version of some system that makes predictions based on a set of assumptions. You predict that 120 TCF of natural gas are recoverable from shale plays given your assumptions. Until you can validate empirically your model, than your predictions remain predictions, and are not "truth" of any sort.
No David. My model is not a prediction and is quit valid. I have no idea if we'll every produce that much NG from the shale plays. Thus I would never make a fool of myself with such a prediction. I can recover 120 TCF of NG today if my pricing assumptions existed today. That's not a prediction...it's a fact. I spent last year doing just that. Unfortunately the price support went away. I know the reservoir characteristics, the cost to drill and complete and the economic requirements of the operators. I run my economic model daily on drilling prospects. It's about as standard as it gets. Again, I'm not predicting I can get 120 TCF...I'm saying I can do it today. All I need is the price support. I can also recover 100 million ounces of gold out of sea water today. That's not a prediction. It's a fact based on a recovery model of gold from sea water. All I need is the price support of gold to be suffciently high enough to make it profitable. Again, I have no idea if gold would ever reach the price needed to make the process work. But, once again, I'm not predicting we'll ever see that price. My model just says that it's possible to recover all that gold with existing technology.
Rockman,
How do you know you can get 120 TCF. How do you know it isn't 110 TCF or 130 TCF? I realize that it is "technically" possible to get gas (or gold or whatever) if you have the proper price support, but how are you getting 120 TCF as the exact amount of recoverable reserves? Is there ANY uncertainty in your model? If so, then it is not "truth" or "fact", but a probability, and much like any other model it needs to be validated (i.e. tested). I understand that you have probably been using this model for years, and if so it has been "validated" numerous times before and there is no reason to suspect it would be wrong now. However, models are models, they are not "truth" or "fact". It is a semantic argument, but an important one.
When NG was over $10.00 mcf, shale gas was much more feasible. If NG goes to $1.50 you might not see the drilling boom that $10.00 mcf gas will bring. Much depends on the price of a lease in the Haynesville or the Marcellus. Some people looked at operating costs, but did not include fixed costs, employee benefit plans, health insurance, pipeline tarrifs etc. in the price of gas. Some companies hedged their production and had cash flow to continue drilling to keep their leases that they spent many dollars to attain. There is a potential problem if a financial institution hedges wrong like Enron did. It could take down a company. Naked derivatives are yet a potential problem as we saw with the 100 billion dollar collapse of AIG. To make it in the oil/natural gas patch you might need to known the bottom line, the odds, and the rocks.
Oops, that is substantiating Rockman. If you are questioning delta errors below and above the estimate, Rockman has provided a very good model with no bias, and unstated variance. Apart from the missing variance, that is a great model in my book. Rockman is basically stating the most probable estimate. With the variance included, this is the value that will occur most frequently if you could run the experiment many times.
In other words, if the number was 110, so what? If the number was 130, so what? Unless this was some over/under sports gambling enterprise, does it really matter?
This is the only good way to look at a model result. If someone presents you with a model that aggregates lots of information, immediately assume that the result is the most probable estimate, and most errors will be symmetric above and below this value. This is in accordance with the central limit theorem. If, on the other hand, you know that the model is a fundamental measure of some physical process governed by entropic considerations, assume the variance is equal to the mean squared, and take your chances.
David -- Is it 110 TCF or 110.1 TCF? Don't split hairs with me son...I'm a geologist. Old joke: question -- what's 2+2 equal? Engineer: 4.0000. Lawyer: what do you want it to be. Prostitute: depends on how much you're willing to pay (not to unlike the lawyer's answer). Geologist: somewhere between 3 and 5.
No..there is no uncertainty in my model. That's because there are no predictions in my model. There are only assumptions. And I can change those assumptions and generate 100 different models. I actually don't think our thought processes are that far apart. Semantics perhaps. I consider that models are facts. Whether they represent the "truth" is of no concern at this level of analysis. But truth(probability of success or being correct) is critical in the risk analysis phase. And that's my point: Dr. Mello's 500 billion bbl model may well be valid. The fact that I might think there's not 1 chance in 100 that this oil will ever be produced doesn't stop me from accepting his model.
I suspect my analysis may be a little too anal for TOD. My apologies if that's so.
Rock,
Apparently what I call a model is what you call fact. Ok. done.
And I believe Mr. Gilbert talked about a three letter word beginning with "L."
@David Murphy
That means a recovery factor of 2% !!!??? Why is the recovery factor so low for this particular oil? To the best of my knowledge, it's currently between 15-50% for most wells, using primary and secondary techniques. I'm guessing secondary techniques would be a serious challenge that deep under-water, so even if that is out of the question, the recovery factor is still between 15-30% isn't it?
Is it not conceivable that with the world facing collapse, enhanced-recovery technology will flourish? Can we not have at least a little faith in new technology? Mr Mello also mentioned that the layer of rock has good porosity, which should be a good help.
I acknowledge that it won't change peak oil, but if 100-200 BBL can come to our rescue, we can have a nice big bump in the decline part of the curve.
Shox,
I am not a geologist or petroleum engineer, so I cannot speak to recovery factors at length. However, it seems that the recovery factor is the % of the original {what - EUR?} that is actually recovered in the end, right? Mr. Mello was speaking about oil that he has found, many miles beneath the surface of earth, so my guess is that Jeremy Gilbert, a petroleum engineer, was speaking from many years of experience. In fact, he spoke the disconnect between what geologist would find and what engineers were able to get out. Sorry I can't answer is detail...
That's not a bad answer David. Except I might qualify it a little: what Dr, Mello THINKS will be found and not what he has found (I think that's his position). Also, I would tend to say "what the geologist THINKS he has found" and what the "engineer THINKS he will recover". Even when you have all the facts in front of you there's still a potential for significant variance.
Agreed...this year's conference (my second) truly was put together well for exactly the reason you mention: opposing points of view make the discussion much richer!
I would add two more fundamental concepts to EROEI (net energy) that we need people to understand.
First, the net export problem, which is so basic it's hard to see how so many people are completely missing it. As producer country consumption goes up and their top line production goes down, there is less oil for oil importing countries to purchase.
The right-half of the age of oil, when viewed from an oil-importing country's point of view, is going to look much more like this:
The curve would be even steeper if declining EROEI were added to it. Thanks to Jeffrey Brown and Sam Foucher for waking me up to this issue.
The second concept deals with the mess we've gotten ourselves into with our monetary system. Although economists (and the population in general) relate to accumulated paper currencies as wealth, because they are a claim on future planetary resources they are actually a liability to the planet. Of course the planet, which last time I checked was finite, cannot have infinite liability put against it. However, the monetary system, being virtual, can increase forever until something stops it from doing so.
This disconnect between what we think is wealth and what the planet can actually provide is growing by the day and has only one way to end (in my view) and that is collapse of paper currencies. There won't be an event to point to that will demonstrate that this weakening relationship was one of the fundamental problems that caused the collapse. It will simply be like sand washing away from under a building foundation until the foundation fails.
Thanks to Chris Martenson for pointing out this doozy of an Achilles heel to me.
I like the way Charlie Hall puts it, it's a race between technology and depletion and depletion is winning.
Actually, it isn't even a race. Fossil fuel resources are limited. Depletion is always going to win, hands down.
Only a switch to using renewable resources can give technology the winning hand.
I completely agree but would the add the following tweak to the sentence below:
It is not that paper currencies will collapse, it is that the belief that they will go on representing a claim on the future resources of the planet and future sweat of humans which will collapse. And ultimately it will be the specialised economic ecology which will disappear as without abundant net energy, and without the ability to pay for it early in the day (ie, cheap) then all other labour and sweat during that day will not be enough to satisfy the interest on the debt holding the currency up.
Once one's eyes are open to these basic truths, one never views the world quite the same again!
Hi, HACland.
Fair enough, the belief collapses first then the currencies. But since the currencies are not real (they aren't anything physical), isn't it ultimately the same thing?
HACland wrote:
Indeed. This speaks to an important distinction between fiat currencies on the one hand and debt-based currency creation on the other - particularly fractional reserve systems.
aangel wrote:
No, because you can have a fiat currency that isn't a debt-created currency and vice versa. (Some local currencies are fiat without being debt-based, for example.) The fact that we don't see a fiat currency not created via debt doesn't mean they can't exist; we just live in a world where all state currencies are based on the fractional-reserve system.
Even when a currency is backed by something "real", like gold, if it uses a fractional reserve system then debt can still expand beyond what the economy can support (i.e. claims on future wealth can expand beyond what real growth in production will support). This is the financial system the world had until most countries left the gold standard around ~1919-1939. There was never enough gold to cover all the paper currency because the fractional reserve system ensured that gold reserves would always be some "fraction" of them. This worked basically because only a fraction of the paper was ever asked to be converted into gold at any time. That also meant it only worked until lots of people asked for their gold deposits back at the same time. This was the cause of bank runs and the original argument for central banks: financial stability - which also happens to come at the cost of moral hazards on the part of lenders (oops!).
If the issuance of debt is instead coupled with someone actually lending pre-existing currency (e.g. when you make a term deposit, buy a bond, etc.) - where the debt-note isn't also usable as a medium of exchange, as the gold-backed bank notes were - then claims on future wealth would exist independently of growth in the money supply. (Those instruments of debt, if usable as a medium of exchange, would otherwise act to increase the supply of "money-equivalents.") Modern banks end up "creating money" because whenever they receive a new deposit, the fractional reserve system generates new loans up to {(the deposit) divided by (the target reserve ratio)}, typically a very large multiple of the original deposit - i.e. in Canadian banks with a target of ~0.5%, it's something like 200 times the original deposit amount.
Bank loans that create money act not just as a claim on future wealth - because they must be paid back from future income - but also on existing wealth - because they are used to make immediate purchases with money that would not otherwise exist, thereby competing with existing currency. On the other hand, a fiat currency need not be created via debt; it could be created by e.g. government expenditures - say, on infrastructure or a progressive tax rebate. This would only act as an increased claim on existing wealth; it would still generate inflation if the economy wasn't also growing at an equal or greater pace, or deflation if it wasn't growing as fast as the economy. However, that's just an argument for why it should be limited to the rate of economic growth.
Coupled with a lending system that depended on banks to act only as mediators between people looking to lend money and those looking to borrow - and not creating money out of nothing - it's unlikely you would see lending so out of touch with reality. If banks wanted to make so many loans they would have to raise interest rates to attract the money, but that would also undermine people's willingness to borrow. On the other hand, if people wanted to lend lots of money, interest rates would decline and fewer people would want to lend.
Adrynian,
all that is true but my question still points to the fact that our currencies happen to be both fiat and debt-based. So for our situation, losing confidence in the currency amounts to the same thing...a distinction without a difference.
Fair enough. I was partly reacting to the sentiment you appeared to be displaying - one that I see many people express, most frequently on other sites but also on TOD at times - that simultaneously denigrates all fiat systems, conflates them with fractional reserve systems, and pines for the return of "the good old days" of gold-backed currency.
Going back to gold - or any other physical/non-fiat/commodity-backed medium of exchange - won't prevent the problems we're currently facing so long as we retain the fractional reserve system. That is the real problem with our financial system.
I apologize for reading into your post, and for using it as a launching pad for this topic, but I felt it was important to explicitly differentiate fiat and fractional reserve systems, particularly since you seemed confused about the difference.
It's not that the "currencies are not real" (i.e. they're fiat) that makes them problematic; they're problematic because they exist via debt-creation which cannot be supported if our economy experiences sustained economic decline. It's grow or implode; no middle ground is possible.
Excellent. Two thumbs up.
Nice graphs.
However see my post above it was game over once debt started expanding and EROEI declining.
Shift everything to the right and add in 30 years of the surreal twilight-zone dreamland period and you got it.
Its a bit interesting that the last decades after WWII have been labeled as the American Dream period of suburbia etc.
Turns out to be a 100% perfect label.
Thanks.
They are animated if you watch version 2.0 of my video:
I think it's possible to go much further than that. This game was over before it even began simply because the fiat currencies were never tied to energy. Of course population growth was still a background pressure, but that's a separate (equally important) issue.
I think the relationship we created between our currencies and real wealth is fundamentally flawed by design. There is/was no way to prevent collapse with this system. Eventually the disconnect catches up to you for whatever reason (dropping EROEI or exponential debt or population pressure) and there is no way to avoid that unless there is some constraint on the increase in money supply.
It might be possible to have designed a poorer system, but it escapes me exactly how.
Note: Link fixed.
Aangel -
! Post Pea is something completely different!!
Whoops, must have been typing quickly, thanks. (Reminder to self: always check links!)
I concur there are other game changers involved i.e oil/debt was not the only one.
However if your willing to tackle the population issue its addressable even at fairly high population levels not easy by any means but addressable to a point. Where that point is is unknown but in the end the key constraint on population is generally water and aquifer depletion. However if allowed migration could actually help even in that regard. Even now our population could be redistributed move to renewable use of our agricultural system and wind itself down without tragedy. I think significant shifts are needed crossing many borders but its even at this late date doable.
Given there are graceful failure modes for population I continue to maintain hope against all odds that we will eventually adopt a wind down thats what I call dignified. In general it means a heck of a lot of intensive organic agriculture at the subsistence level for many but given the alternative its not bad. The natural cycle of agriculture ensures some time is available at points in the years to both enjoy yourself and create something besides food to increase your standard of living although slow it does not have to be a zero/negative lifestyle. And as population pressure reduced then the overall system improves.
However all the solutions I seem to be able to come up with involve low tech innovative use of local resources and corrected population patterns with a fairly small amount of high tech to enhance the quality of life.
And even here its clear we have not even scratched the surface of providing "high tech" to subsistence farmers.
Right now the monetary system effectively precludes this but once its the only game in town then I think the situation can change rapidly.
Hopefully you can see that even now at this late date if your willing to give up on the old system and forget about it and focus on how to build a new system focusing on reducing the population with dignity we can still change.
Of course its not so late that its impossible to transition the "old" its toast but the right answer has never changed its just a bit harder to execute now than it was 40 years ago. But the basic things that need to be done are the same and the solution is the same. Rebalance the distribution of the worlds population to achieve sustainability and wind down growth and use technology to increase the quality of life for everyone. It does not matter if its 1,2,4,?? billion people however your obviously getting into the danger zone as you pass four not impossible but exponentially more difficult to pull off.
Surprisingly given I often come off as a super doomer I think the way out will remain open even as our current economic system crashes I think that the opportunity to change exists and the door if you will to make that change will remain open regardless of what happens to the existing system. Maybe its not wide open now but its still not closed and won't be no matter what.
Funnily enough the rapid concentration of wealth at the top which is the intrinsic reason we crash "early" also means our other options are still open.
So by being too greedy we have left a window or door or escape route open if we choose to take it.
Its sort of like someone harvesting trees clear cutting as fast as they can and leaving the ones in ravines and steepest mountain side that are too difficult to get when the clear cutting is done and the business collapses you still have the trees in the ravines and you can responsibly use them to restore a balanced forest. Right now we see these last trees as resources available to the clear cutting civilization they are not however maybe just maybe its enough to create a new civilization if your careful.
I will always agree that it is theoretically possible to sort ourselves out. It would require:
So, yes, it's theoretically possible that all this could happen before collapse arrives.
You should get right to work on that, Mike ;-).
Seriously, I once believed this could be done, but no longer. Here is an email I sent to Chris Nelder, Jeff Jelten and Jason Bradford about a month ago that explains my view now:
Well I'm dabbling in alternative energy. Finally putting my chem degree to use.
This is based on liquified gas as a energy storage preferably liquid nitrogen if I can get it to work.
Not because its the "best" but because I think it can be done cheaply and has a number of benefits.
Cold is good stuff.

And I joined the local currency group in Portland. The end of the national/international fiat money regimes does
not have to be that painful simple credit clearing is more than enough to support a robust local economy.
They may not take off until after the system collapses but it turns out that done correctly local currencies seem
sound and if abused fail rapidly. Money turns out to be and almost trivial problem if your trying to live within your means. I think that only the larger number of bank failures that occurred during the depression prevented a return to local currencies people where hurt so bad they where simply mentally unable to trust the creation of local currencies.
This time around although I think people will be burned we have lived with credit long enough to understand its both good and bad and won't react quite the same way. Thats my hope at least.
Certainly I continue to watch as things unfold but its more as a sort of voyeur almost :)
At some point you just have to treat it as what it is a sad historical event playing out in real time.
The "real world" or what happens next has already started to grow and form it does not take much to find a way to turn your back on the last of the historical melodrama and focus on the future. I'll admit I still watch out of morbid interest but mentally and even physically I've already moved on to look past todays events as best I can.
Plenty of places to find your niche in the transition town movement.
I'd say about the only reason I still write is in vain hope that perhaps Obama might go on national TV and explain to all Americans how badly we have screwed up and give us a chance of taking our lumps and getting through to something real and sustainable or crashing. Crazily enough I have this small hope that he will default on the dollar stop all the insanity dismantle the Fed and help America refocus on itself and its closet neighbors. In the end the only solution is for US to follow in the footsteps of Japan and effectively seal ourselves off from the world and let our absence both give us a chance to heal and the world a chance to succeed or fail with out either our help or meddling.
Sure it means we default on our current obligations and it will hurt like hell but its not deadly we and the world would survive and eventually once the wounds heal prosper again.
But thats just the nation doing what the transition town movement is doing so why not start early and hope that the nation will follow ?
Bwaha. Cold is bad because efficiency is related to differences in temperatures. When the phase transition occurs, the area gets cold and efficiency plummets. Compressed nitrogen is loads better than condensed. Majorian can explain it to you.
I suggest you straddle a LN2 cannister and take a sledgehammer to the nozzle. If you have it pointed in the right direction and hold on tight, you have a remote chance of making it to the moon. Good luck.
Bwaha squared.
LOL
That would get you the worlds fastest ice rink. I've poured LN2 over the floor many times. It cool as hell of the top of my head I forget the effect but you get a gas barrier forming and it literally dances over the floor.
It not cheap so I never dumped a full container but you should get a killer ice rink. Need to resurface just dump some more.
Dang can't remember the name of the effect you can get it with water and a hot griddle also arghhh google is not helping.
And generally there is no nozzle just a foam cork and that is generally open to allow boil off.
And of course this highlights things that modern engineers miss cold is very very useful as much as energy itself.
All kinds of processes use cold not to mention storing food. Getting energy out the other in is really a freebie.
And forget about electricity why ?
Use air powered motors. 200 psi is more than enough to power tons of other uses say a full machine shop.
The machine shop itself can make everything locally for the entire system given the right alloys even bearings if you had to.
Your actual electrical usage is down to your telecomunications gear and a few lights.
And compressed air can make heat ..
Hot enough to boil water.
Obviously you can condense all the clean water you want so theres your water supply no contamination no disease.
I just outlined a way a community could live a very nice lifstyle with all the amenities of our modern homes with practically no electricity only if you want light bulbs and computers. If you don't want those then none is needed and except for a few air powered motors readily created except for a few bearing by any machine shop your done.
And the shop itself can avoid large castings for its tools using concrete or even stone or synthetic stone for the beds leaving just the fixtures for a single lath and mill and the required tools as input.
Certainly lots of knowledge needs to be transmitted and skills acquired but with some fairly small inputs a farming village in India could dramatically increase its standard of living on its own rivaling if not better combined with other concepts the "American Dream".
Obviously I don't see a lot of reason for using much electricity outside of lights if you want them and things like computers and televisions which can be made very energy efficient.
I'm not aware of a good non electrical source of lighting but certainly its doable just I think no one has really looked. Obviously good old fire works. But once your down to your computer and lights as all that requires electricity then I'd say who cares. PV and some air power are more than enough to power these use cases esp with some more work on efficiency.
Of course since its not efficient for generating electricity there is no sense in thinking about what could be done with LN2 to create a enhanced high quality lifestyle so ...
Its actually a bit sad that people today don't think a lot about how to create all the creature comforts you could want doing away with almost all of the crap we have made today. Turns out 99% of it can be tossed out the window if you think about it a bit.
And this is not even considering passive solar homes simple solar water heaters etc etc etc.
Other paths exist that may very well prove to be better than the ones our society and civilization chose. I've reached the point that now I see electrical generation as a very minor need that can be met in any number of ways.
So while everyone else runs off and tries to figure out how to make electricity to power their EV's to their electrical everything McMansion I'll follow in the path of the Amish and hopefully extend the road they are taking.
Unfortunately I have to respond to the software comment my full name is Michael Emmel it won't take you long to find the software I've written. Try WebKit and Michael Emmel or Gtk DirectFB Michael Emmel or Cairo and of course DirectFB be careful about laughing at people without googling and theres a lot more back in the past with Java. I ported Java to NeXT so ...
Digging I actually found my first big project sniff been a long time.
I love it because I wrote a complete way to call any native code on the platform entirely in the Java language.
Most people would claim this is impossible but most people don't think outside the box.
I hate to bring this up but I've been making very significant contributions to open source for years most of it for no monetary compensation. Of course you could have googled anytime you wanted and figured this out my damn email address is splattered everywhere in a crap load of open source :(
Hacking is a very noble hobby.
Given some of my code is used in this project and similar ones.
I'd say its a lot more than a noble hobby. I hope that I've helped change someones life for the better.
Opensource software has helped a lot of people around the world from poor children to providing a platform for programmers after the Soviet Union self destructed. I work with many people from the FSU who where able to turn their lives around working on linux and eventually getting well paying programing jobs.
Linux is helping untold numbers of software engineers in China and India to advance their understanding of real software to the point they can compete with US programmers on par. Not just cheap programming labor but first class talent.
They command top salaries in their home countries and this pulls up their peers salaries and encourages more to learn how to really program and not just go to the right school as its done in Asia. If they don't get paid they go to a country that will pay them for their abilities. And these are not H1B's fresh off the boat that don't know jack.
Its globalization done the right way with equality and choice amongst people with equal talents.
You can call it a hobby if you wish but this means you don't understand the political aspect theres a lot more to it than that and its the reason why people write open source. Programming a computer happens to be one of the few professions possible in many parts for the world regardless of who you are with a reasonable investment.
Its provided a road out of poverty for many and open source has and will continue to be a political movement.
This hobby has already upset America's stranglehold on software and its not even close to its goals.
In fact its starting to dawn on many that open source developers are not just hobbyists we know exactly what we want to achieve and have already accomplished a lot. Its no just hacker software any more its hardware and industrial software like CAD/CAM systems etc database the list is endless.
One example of many and this is just one CNC package.
A hobby ?
Hell a good bit of the "establishment" now runs on our communist anti-commercialism rabidly political software.
The US government cannot afford to piss of the open source hobbyists these days.
Your new filing technique is unstoppable.
WHT,
Memmel DOES tend to ramble but electrons ARE cheap-and there are some real nuggets in there sometimes.
Open source software is one of them-in the past copy righted programs were really worth the money but nowadays the free stuff is capable of handling most day to day computing needs just fine-and the savings for people who need only the basics can be huge.
I have little doubt that before too long open source will be taught in conjunction with copy right stuff such as Microsoft and Mac put out-the time is right.There are lots of businesses paying out MEGAbucks for Windows simply because thier employees haven't learned Linux -YET.
That dam will break one day and you will have to have your introductory os course under your belt to get a clerical job thereafter.
Of course Bill Gates marketing people are among the best and they may manage to hold onto thier near monopoly for a while yet.
The problem is that Emmel used that open-source rant as an "appeal to authority". This is one of the oldest tricks in the rhetorical book. I knew right away that his appeal had nothing to do with the argument at hand, so I just had to mock him.
A safety alert is in order for nitrogen, liquid or gas. It is very easy to get asphyxiated with nitrogen because it is odorless. All that is required is for the oxygen level to fall below 15% from the normal 20.95% and breathing it will cause unconsciousness.
As a process engineer I always tested the air in enclosed spaces before allowing workers to enter. At a facility in Arkansas a worker stuck his head through a manhole in a tank and inhaled a couple of breaths of low oxygen air and collapsed in front of fellow workers who were unable to revive him.
I am not crazy about using EROI for comparing one fuel with another, because their use is really part of a system, and that has not really been evaluated. But if one does look at EROIs, the one that is far and away better than the others is coal, at 80.
The high EROI implies that this is a place we are getting quite a bit of our net energy from. If we decide we don't want this net energy (very possibly for good reason), it is going to be a lot harder (and more expensive in terms of energy) to get the net energy elsewhere.
The high EROI of coal implies that a very high price must be put on carbon emissions, in order for coal production to shift to other fuel sources. The EROI table would seem to suggest that with a cap and trade system, coal use would shift to the next lower EROI, which is wind, but I think coal use would shift to the next lower cost (in the US) energy source, which is natural gas. (For wind, I don't think EROI picks up major parts of the costs, including financing and necessary add-ons to the transmission system, so it is not really comparable to the other EROIs.)
So we are talking about going from an EROI of 80 for coal to an EROI of about 10 for natural gas. This is a huge drop. It is not clear that we have enough natural gas to replace coal either. I wish there were a good solution. With debt becoming harder and harder to get in the future, I think both wind and nuclear will be increasingly out of reach.
No and I can prove it.
The total amount of energy we can get out of an energy resource is
Eo + Einv.
Ebase resource x DE direct efficiency = Eo + Einv
Eo/Einv=EROI; EROI ranges from 1 to infinity(EROI less than 1 is net energy negative).
Therefore Eo/Ebr = (EROI x DE direct efficiency)/(EROI+1)= OE overall efficiency.
If EROI = 1 then OE = DE/2.
If EROI = infinity then OE = DE.
So the effect of falling EROI is to reduce the conversion efficiency of base resources to E output to up to 50% (at EROI =1).
If we can increase our direct efficiency then we can get by fuel produced by low but net energy EROI sources.
The limitations on increasing direct efficiency is due to our reliance on heat engines to produce mechanical work where theoretical efficiency is determined by temperature differences
according to Carnot's law direct efficiency of turning heat differences into work is DE = (Thot-Tcold)/Thot.
In order to raise direct efficiency you must raise the operating temperature but the physical limitations of materials is the problem.
Batteries and fuel cells are not heat engines but do require inputs of 'finished energy' to work.
Wind and solar PV also are not heat engines but have physical limitations as well.
EROI lowers the overall efficiency OE by up to 50%.
So the effect of 500 billion barrels of oil at an EROI of infinity would be the same as 250 billion barrels at an EROI of 1.
Considering the huge amounts of oil sands about(600 Gb?), oil shale(800 Gb?) and heavy oil(400 Gb?) it seems logical that they will be developed assuming 'complexity' doesn't do use in.

I welcome any paper that you write or have written discussing the problems with EROI, my email is attainable through this website, but I do not understand what you are showing in the above mathematically relation (please don't write a 1000 word post explaining so - put it in more formal writing and email it to me, thanks!).
Sorry, I'm not understanding how this assertion could be true. The system stops working well far sooner than when we reach an EROEI of 1. The only reason we are using biofuels that are this low is because they are piggybacking on an infrastructure that was created with energy sources far higher than an EROEI of 1.
Despite your math and your claim that Dave's comment doesn't hold, in the real world such practical considerations make a difference. In my view, Dave's statement is entirely valid:
What Majorian is saying is that theoretically you can bootstrap the process.
For example, say hypothetically we created a nanotech replicator that works by feeding on the energy it finds (this has other problems, see Bill Joy's "gray goo" problem). No humans are involved so that no money is involved. Financial considerations are irrelevant. All that matters is the physics of Carnot engines and thermodynamic efficiencies that Majorian mentions. Profits are automatic. QED.
Of course the reality of this borders on the South Park underpants profit scheme, but so be it. Theoretically it is a real possibility.
High school algebra is bootstrapping?
Hooboy.
WHT,
You are dangerous.
Algebraically removing the effects of money?
Afaik, the Carnot cycle only applies to situations where you convert one energy form to another (say heat to mechanical movement to/or electricity). If you use the heat that is not converted by this conversion for heating greenhouses, houses, or industrial processes that can do with low heat sources then the efficiencies can get much higher.
That's why modern power plants start to use the combined heat and power CHP method. In the Netherlands in some places even the CO2 from the burning of FF is fed to greenhouses which makes some plants grow faster and yield higher production.
The definition specifically refers to work, i.e. force applied along a distance. Since changes of temperature is just a difference in entropy then of course the application of the law differs.
Natalie Angier's book is The Canon
change made :)
The EROI table is telling; I found that especially useful. I suspect the EROI on coal may be artificially high, however, as the world depletes high-grade coal and moves toward coals with a lower BTU content; I'm speaking specifically of the importance the Gillette field plays in our current base-load power generation as it displaces the energy-dense (and depleting) Appalachian coal. It will be even lower as cap-and-trade comes into play, or we seek to sequester the carbon dioxide generated by coal combustion.
My point (and I am biased against fossil fuels) is that one's instinct may be to support coal to maximize EROI. However, given that much of our coal reserves aren't as energy dense as they were in the past and are located in increasingly difficult terrain, I think our efforts would best be put towards developing technology to increase the EROI of nuclear and renewables closer to the 18:1 or 20:1 ratio.
speaking of coal on that table....the magnitude value looks low. Is "mine mouth" specific to hard rock (or whatever non-strip mining is called?). The units look like work to to convert to tonnage, but the fact that coal is the same as wind (5 EJ) and slightly more than half of nuclear is puzzling.
I don't have the sources at hand but it's said that one of the most expensive renewable sources of energy, PV, has an energy payback time of about one year. Now, assuming that a solar panel will continue to produce renewable energy for another 30+ years with only very little maintenance, it is without a doubt that PV has one of the highest EROI available: +/- 30. So why does that table only show 6.5?
Production of ever thinner cells, thin film, higher levels of automation, roll to roll, and other positive scale factors makes the EROI increase every year (in contrast to all conventional energy sources). At the same time price will go down because of the same factors.
It seems to me that it's not a question of if PV will become one of the most important primary energy sources but when.
Absolute true. Electric energie helds by fare more exergy than for example chemical energie in crude (with by fare more anergy), it is allready no prob to build an electric car, perhaps it may not run 100 mph for 500 miles and it will cost a little more (but with a declining cap) than a conventional car...
It will be absolute no prob (but not with the american suburb lifestyle) to support even 10 billion by solar-energy (the true problem - as i statet in another post - is not overpopulation but dysgenic tendencies). Also an electric harvester does his job, maybe a little less efficient or better said a little less fast but not sooo much poorer. I know this will not work with airplanes but for that special task there will be at least some BTL or in the end (2050+) fluid hydrogen made of solar power.
The problem is infact the storage of wind- and solar-energie when the winds are low and there is allready night. Maybe this (see link) or hydrogen-cells will be a solution but we actually have no adequate awnser - thats not so nice...
Sorry Majorian, I don't get that. ERoEI is straight physics, either side of the see-saw.
I get scared every time infinity or zero get introduced into a discussion, especially a comparative one...
You seem to be saying that at any rate of energy gain, it is worth extracting energy.
Fair enough in a physical sense, but not with our current fiscal constructs, and not with sequestration done properly.
Just like Lehman Bros, you run(with exponential rapidity)into the law of diminishing returns :)
Good post David, this is what most have been battling with for the past years. There's always some thing "X" that should change the game according to people who haven't thought about PO that hard. It's difficult to argue against some simple "X", when you own argument is systemic, and not always distillable to a single five word sound-bite.
One way of going about this could be the classic Popper style falsification with ruthless Feynman style: try to prove yourself wrong as fast as possible. Hard data, models, systems models and probability analysis.
In fact, I'd like to see a good, well-researched group-think post on debunking Peak oil from us at TOD. Not from naysayers, not from CERA, but the cream of the crop of people at TOD.
Yes, we've been doing it on-and-off here and there for the past year. But not as a concentrated and focused group effort.
If somebody should know enough peak oil data to debunk it, it should be the most knowledgeable and analytic peak oil people themselves.
They just need to methodologically put on a devil's advocate hat and start shooting all sorts of probability holes in the theories.
Once those are done, some really distilled gems of counter-arguments may emerge against the debunking arguments. Good models, nice graphs, clear metaphors, some single sentence PR rebuttals that will drop Daniel Yergin's heart an inch the next time he starts talking about P3 reserves and P/R ratios or some other silliness.
Anybody up for this game?
And before anybody misreads, no this does not mean that I've started a yearly subscription to CERA or that I've become a 'creamy-nugget-core-of-abiotic-oil' convert :)

"Know thy enemy" JK
Could be a good post - a compilation of the top ten arguments against PO or something like that...
I've started this process with Part 2 of my video "Rebuttals."
I expect to keep expanding it and I'm very open to new rebuttals that should be included. For the moment they are going beneath the video player as a note until I begin work on Version 3.0 of the video, which will be sometime in the new year.
The most convincing rebuttal to me is simply the uncertainty of what is under the ground in many countries and many areas. Related to this is the likelihood that companies and corporations are not giving completely accurate data, for various reasons.
This of course can cut both ways. Most PO'ers recognize that the sudden major "adjustments" in reserve estimates of OPEC countries in the '80s strongly suggests hanky panky. But what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander--if we base our doom partly on likely inaccuracies, others may well claim that countries and companies could have something to gain by understating the amount of oil they have.
I can think of a variety of counterarguments, but when you are dealing with basic distrust of the data, articulate argumentation gets tricky.
Hi, dohboi.
I wouldn't go down that path, myself.
I've always had the view that there is now more than enough data to go on to draw some conclusions. I think a lot of people (I'm not saying you) use the line "well, there isn't enough data to go on so we should do nothing" more as a way to get away with being lazy or because they see that their position can't be supported. Both are quite common.
It's not easy to call someone on being lazy without them getting their knickers in a knot, so generally it's a successful technique on their part to kill the inquiry. One has to be in a teacher or coaching role (or the boss) to be able to get away with telling someone "stop being lazy, let's dig into the numbers." Without that relationship, the person will become quite testy and defend their view to the death despite knowing full well that the real reason they are saying there isn't enough data is because the answer will take some work to get to and they can't be bothered.
It seems the UK Energy Research Centre in their recent report has the same take on things as I do:
Good point, and I really appreciate all your work. I plan to use some of it with students.
My post was in the spirit of answering the question, "What kinds of reservations might (at least marginally) reasonable people raise when they first hear about peak oil?"
I think our assumptions are correct, but I know many people deeply distrust the oil industry in general (often for good reason), and specific countries in particular (particularly Saudi Arabia, not the least given that bin Laden and most of the 9/11 crew were Saudis).
My main take away from Simmons work is more that we do not know what is under the Saudi sands than that we know for sure that their productive capacity is at a certain point. The kind of proxy data we have to depend on may be convincing for you and me, but it is an area where reasonably reasonable people may have at least some serious questions.
Thanks again for all your great work.
You're welcome.
The goal of the video is to put in one place a coherent narrative that hits enough of the main points that a generally open minded person would be persuaded that peak oil is both imminent and a problem. It won't persuade everyone but such is life. (We're still arguing over climate change, for lord's sake.)
Thanks André. I've looked and sent to others your videos. They are clear, concise and illustrative. Your work is excellent, thanks for sharing!
What I'm after is perhaps something more quantitative, decision-maker based all-out debunking (and subsequent rebuttals to these), sub-divided into parts:
1) URR - I think this theme is well-discussed quantitatively during the past 10 years and can be summarized using various different results and then applying probability analysis to show the range and probability density function. Should be the easiest to complete. All it needs is data compiling and some runs of basic functions.
2) Flow rate. We know this is what it's all about, but the opinions on this differ, depending on how people weigh post-peak decline rates, EOR, investments, pricing, volatility, etc. A simple price/investment/cost/volatility/demand model might suffice. That's 5 variables. Based on a stock model from 1 of course.
3) Exportability. This is of course what mattes to most of OECD and to China + India as well. ELM could be a starting point here, but again, the approach would perhaps need to be more probabilistic and needs as an input no.2 at the very least.
4) Investments. This is the favourite area of IEA (since 2008) and Matt Simmons. How much does it cost, what is the time horizon, risks, incentives, etc. Again IEA / Hirsch (DOE) figures could be a starting point, but need more variance in there along with some probability weighting (how?).
5) Economic price impact. This is more about oil price demand elasticity, price to gdp ratio-threshold for economic growth, demand adjustment vs demand destruction and volatility. Again, perhaps using historical data from 70s and the recent spike as a starting point. Not much of a data source to sample, but better than nothing. Based on this, one could give safer ranges, show what kind of shocks economy can tolerate for how long, etc.
6) Savings / alternatives scaling. This should be fairly easy and I'd probably just use bio-physical limits (land area, biomass) and efficiency ceilings (biomass to liquids conversion eff max) as the ultimate limiter rather than going to endless economic price fights about probability. In the end the outcome at max will probably be so small in terms of flow rate anyway that it doesn't matter in the scale of things. Would be happy to be proven wrong by this exercise though. Everything below those is the most likely outcome.
7) Gap consequences. This is for the policy wonks. Not so much about price per se, but more about loss of availability of fuel and petroleum products in general. Drop speed, magnitude and timing compared to daily operations of a society and against economic growth. Again, there is some scenario work on this already, but haven't seen probabilistic models on this.
That's roughly seven sub-areas. One can then walk a decision maker through them one-by-one. Of course, ideally at least the biggest feedbacks, esp. negative ones would need to be factored in (for debunking purposes). It is a system after all. Some people here (can't find the posts now) have already proposed something like this several times. These are not my ideas - I'm just pulling stuff together from many sources (you know who you are).
This would be a fairly sizeable undertaking. I don't have the skills or the time to complete that kind of thing myself. But I would be willing to participate and work as free slave labour for the common good though.
But it calls for a project leader with a better big picture view than I have and more analytical-statistical skills.
The trouble is, where do we find one - or does anybody else thinks this would be a worthwhile effort to begin with. I fully understand those people who are now diverting the time they are using more towards preparation, practical arrangements and post-peak planning/education in general.
One could of course just start with one. After all I think (1) is pretty much completed, it just took way too long to get there. We need to accelerate the other 6 if we are ever to make the point across in terms of decision making.
Is there such a need for decision makers? After having talked to some local national people in the know about these issues recently, I do think that they are not properly informed on the subject and their ability to do robust decision making on this issue is severely limited. In plain English: they are flying blind based on historical altimeter readings about energy, feeling pretty hopeful there won't be a mountain anywhere near the horizon.
To me, hope is not a strategy.
Hi, SamuM.
I think that some of the debunking areas you mention are good to look at (the investments and alternatives scaling in particular), and I'm likely to tackle those in Version 3.0.
My challenge now is to keep the video a "reasonable" length and not too techy. It's already getting into the techy zone with R/P ratios. Personally, I have no trouble making the case with a bit of math (trained as an engineer), but most people's tolerance for math is very, very low.
If you do get your project going and treat each topic in depth (a good idea), I think it would appeal just to people comfortable with numbers. Now, that's still a lot of people and they have to come onside eventually because the people uncomfortable with numbers (sometimes) defer to their judgement.
The other really big problem with explaining our energy predicament is that it's, well, a really big problem. It's taken me years to get my arms around everything there is to know well enough to discern what is important to talk about and what isn't.
Add to that that everyone thinks they are an expert in energy and it's a very, very steep hill to climb to get them to see something new.
I am all for this. The way I see it, what gets us in trouble is using heuristics taken from equations that describe the wrong problem. These are basically sunk-cost heuristics that we are afraid to debunk because it makes us look indecisive, and we have invested too much in trying to defend them. Unfortunately, as you say, that is not the way that science works. Science works by questioning itself and reinventing itself when necessary.
Plus you are right, I see absolutely no probability analysis. You mentioned Richard Feynman; well, he essentially lived in the world of probabilities and was able to demonstrate the most amazing results, and moreover he educated an entire generation at how to think differently about a problem.
As I found out earlier in this thread, the field of Geostatistics seems particularly misguided about how to interpret probability and statistics. I wrote this up.
“The quantity of oil, gas, coal, or any other energy bearing resource that is left in the Earth is not the question, all that matters is that portion that can be exploited at a significant energy profit.”
It is profit that matters, not energy profit, though of course, zero energy return does imply a profit of less than zero (i.e. a net economic loss).
Suppose we had two reservoirs of energy one of magnitude M which could be exploited at EROI=20 throughout it life time and a second reservoir of magnitude 2M which could be exploited at EROI=2 throughout its lifetime. The first reservoir will provide us 0.95M units of net energy and the second will provide us 1.0M units of net energy.
What determines whether the second reservoir is economically exploitable and the rate at which we are likely to exploit it? This question cannot be answered without knowing the total resource cost of exploitation including non-energy inputs. If the value of the non-energy resources expended is equal to the value of the net energy gained then we are economically dead in the water. You cannot determine the profitability from energy balance alone even in lowest order.
If you make the assumption that the associated non-energy resources which are consumed along with a unit of input energy are of equal value for different energy production processes, then you can you use the ratio of net energy to input energy (NEROI=EROI-1) as a figure of merit for the resource productivity.
For example if one energy process combined 10 hours of labor with 1GJ of energy to produce 2GJ (EROI=2) of energy then the labor productivity is 0.1GJ(Net)/hour. If a second process combines 1GJ of energy with 10 hours of labor to produce 10GJ (EROI=10) then the labor productivity is 0.9GJ(Net)/hour. The productivity of the second process is 9 times greater than that of the first not, five times greater as would be suggested by using EROI as a figure of merit.
However, the assumption that the value of the non-energy inputs is related to the input energy by a universal multiplicative constant is incorrect. For example the high opportunity costs of water consumption used by CSP plants in the desert might economically outweigh energy balance considerations when comparing this method of energy production to some method which uses a less scarce resource. The value of the non-energy inputs is not a second order effect. If you think so then you have not thought through the problem carefully.
Roger,You have made some good points here.
I have a couple off topic questions relevant to some eroi problems.
Somebody here should know the answers.
Could only partially treated(solids and maybe some solutes filtered out) waste water be used to cool cpv power installations in part or in total?
This might make a considerable difference in both the energy budget and in the financial budget of such an installation.
I am also wondering if a desalination plant can be operated on intermittent power(wind) without damaging the equipment or taking so long to ramp uo and down that only base load power works satisfactorily. If a desalination plant can be operated at varying power input levels it would be a good way to use up any excess renewable energy which will be available from time to time, especially from the wind but maybe also from csp later on..
No particular reason you can't do pumped storage with salt water.
I'm not sure about the utility of a desalination plant in general. Your probably better off with some sort of very simple thermal/solar distillation solution.
Maybe a
Coupled with evaporation of ponds of salt water at the base and natural cloud/condensation at the top if its tall enough.
Effectively a man made rain cloud. Hot humid air enters at the bottom and condenses at the top....
The ponds themselves or some of them could also be of the salt gradient form.....
The solar tower itself could double as a water tank/pumped storage i.e the top of the tower could be your almost traditional water tank with a hole in the middle and the large mass of water would certainly help cool the rising column of moist air its just a glorified condenser. Done correctly you might even get most of the condensation to occur above the tank and its basic gravity feed off brush like collectors into the tank no mechanical pumps.
This probably means the bottom half or so of the tank is insulated from the tower with the heat exchangers near the top. This means you probably need some sort of simple swamp cooler like setup on the top.
You might be able to get away with using variants of the capillary effect to cool. Other possibilities exist.
A super simple and neat way to create a pump can be done using a simple water bottle.
Fill a bottle with water and plug the end with a paper towel and hang it upside down. Overtime as the water evaporates a decent vacuum forms which can be used to power anything.
If your condensation results in a net water gain then this is automatic no moving parts. The air for evaporation of the vacuum system could be the cold dry air above the condensation zone and this could even be feed back down the tower and across the evaporation ponds if its worth it.
The whole thing if done right would set there and do its thing maybe for centuries with little maintenance.
Perhaps not the most efficient solution but dead simple cheap materials and low maintenance.
Memmel,
Thanks these are interesting ideas that I can understand in principle-whether they are financially feasible and scalable I have no idea.
My basic idea concerning my original question was to find out if desalination can be effectively coupled with intermittent wind and solar power -there will eventually be an occasional surplus of both in some places near big cities with major water problems-such as southern California.
Any short term excess of desalinated water could be pumped into a reservoir and would thus serve as a defacto battery-of course if the reservoir were locted in such a place that t could be used to generate some pumped hrdo power that would be another plus.
I don't know if a suitable reservoir exists in southern California.
But there must be a number of places in this country where any temporary excess wind and solar power can be used to pump water efficiently, thereby helping justify the expense of the installations.
It would be interesting to see a reasonably comprehensive list made up of ways to use such temporary surpluses effectively.
Another way that might be cost effective would be to heat a large amount of stored water inside large buildings such as hotels which could them be distributed as hot water to the kitchen and rooms or even circulated thru radiators during the winter.
I have a feeling that lots of such schemes that are currently not practical will make good sense in the fairly near future.
If for instance you are building a new house it might pay to excavate the basement a few feet over size and install insulation three or four feet away from the walls, thereby enclosing many cubic yards of back fill.Any excess output from a solar system either thermal or electrical could be used to heat this backfill and thereby greatly reduce the amount of purchased energy needed to heat the house.
Or a smart grid could feed wind generated electricity into the system during off peak hours, heating the fill,thereby leveling the heating load of the house-it might be possible to use off peak wind to supply the entire heating load if the heat sink is large enough-say big enough for a whole week.
I have had some first hand experience with excavation work and there is no reason that creating such a heat sink should cost a great deal if the ground is favorable.
Some neat ideas tonight, Mac.
Your desal (and Memmel's) seems like it might invite being comprised of numerous smaller units which can start/stop with less individual inertia, all contributing individually to the water supply.
For heating storage, it might make sense to excavate the cellar space and leave bulkhead access for another storage medium, like water, oil or glycol. Up here in Maine, people are getting rid of their oil tanks, and I only wish I had enough yardspace to extend the basement for a five-hundred to a thousand gallons of heatsink like that.. of course, the soil is already there, and free, and doesn't leak, so the loss of a bit of energy-density comes at a great savings..
Hi Johkul,
Living in an existing house can definitely put some limits on your options.We own a considerable amount of land but our house is situated close to the property line and we are in bad shape for morning sun especially in the winter, and there are shade trees on the west side that are worth more keeping us cool here than the output of a roof mounted solar system, considering that we would have to cut the trees and build the system.
We heat with wood and use only fifty to seventy five gallons of oil per year to back up the wood heat.Space is tight inside the house but I'm trying to figure out a way to use the wood stove to preheat our domestic hot water without running a lot of pipes and taking up living space.
A while back I tried an experiment with a little homemade wood stove that I made out of piece of ten inch diameter pipe years ago-it is about eighteen inches high , has tripod legs, and a hinged top that must be raised to put in wood or take out the ashes,as well as a built in chimney about two feet high.I made it years ago out of scrap between times on a winter time welding construction job and we used it warm up and make coffee and so forth-you can put a pot or frying pan on the top, which is flat.
So we were doing some insulating in the barn and I decided what the hell-lets see how long she will stay hot ON TOP on one charge of wood if we INSULATE the bottom and sides.
So we filled her up and then we wrapped her up in fiberglass-the stuff most people call rock wool-and fastened the insulation with a few turns of tie wire-the whole job took only fifteen minutes or so.Set the draft at about a third of the normal opening and put a pot of water to boil on her.
I estimate from this down and dirty experiment that insulating a wood stove -except for the cooking surface of course-can effectively cut the amount of fuel needed for cooking by half or more-and at the same time the cook would be much more comfortable if the weather is warm or hot.
Maybe some of the do gooder organizations will pick up on this idea and incorporate it into the stoves they are sending to the third world where fuel is really scarce. Of course they may already be doing this-but a few minutes spent searching the subject leads me to think they aren't.
Why limit yourself to installing solar panels on the roof?
Perhaps just have a solar gazebo instead, where it is sunny?...
I don't think it can be made that small. All its really doing is capturing a rising thermal and its based on dropping air pressure. This means tall at least ten stories or so just guessing. That tall or taller by definition cannot be small. It would be designed a bit differently from the cooling towers often used with nuclear reactors but would be on a similar scale. Smaller scale designs would probably have to use some other way to condense the water. And of course it all depends on the input temperature. You could probably make a decent test rig with just pvc pipe and some plastic sheet. I'm in Oregon and right now water is not exactly a issue and sunshine is rare :)
Here is a very simple variant same basic idea....
However there is no air flow in the small designs and to get the flow you need a chimney to get the water to condense before the air exists the chimney means some sort of condenser. If you have the water stored at the top aka a water tank then you get both and your using the thermal energy to both pump the water and desalinate it.
As far as other solutions such as reverse osmosis etc they are expensive the filters are far from cheap the electrical equipment etc etc. This is something that can be built with one professional and a lot of unskilled labor. I suspect brick would work or better tile.
This method creates some impressive and light vaults however I can't see why with some simple modifications you could not also create a very tall tower out of nothing but clay tiles. Potentially the heating area could be done using black tile vaults over the water also.
The tiles themselves could potentially be fired in a solar kiln.
Obviously you can keep on making tiles after your evaporator is done. These could be used for example to make sealed water piped and with some thought I suspect you could create a drip irrigation system.
Outside of knowledge and excessing the right clays and other materials and whatever you need to build the kilns the rest is local resources and labor.
The concept is very similar to ancient designs.
In effect almost the reverse of the windcatchers. Natural wind and a good design could make it even easier to make.
You have to work through the engineering and put the numbers in but is very doable. And your talking a structure that would last for centuries or longer with little or no maintenance.
Might as well stick in another idea I've been rolling around :)
Instead of using mortars I've been thinking about creating a brick that has a frit edge or porous edge.
This can be done by mixing in sawdust and firing the brick the organic matter burns away and leaves pores.
Next the fun part you mix up some thermite
And soak our paint the brick edges.
Place the brick where you want it and then set off the thermite. Normally the is done with magnesium but I bet it can be done with concentrate solar energy aka a magnifying glass.
This will melt the porous part of the brick or tile and create whats effectively a ceramic weld.
Hopefully very strong.
Only the aluminum needed is a bit of a issue but not really these days and of course its a fairly small amount overall.
Of course being a chemist I've carried the idea to and extreme and having actually come up with a valid reason to make thermite generally you do it for no reason at all :)
If this works I'm thinking about slap welded bricks. After the thermite layer is put on you paint with a thin layer of aluminum perchlorate maybe even mix in a touch of magnesium :)
Set the brick or tile in place ( fast before it dries ) then you just wack it with a hammer and off it goes.
Of course there are some saftey issues to work out with the last method but having come up with a valid reason to make both thermite and aluminum perchlorate I have to be on to something :)...
Now to extend the concept to make fluorine perchlorate mentioned in the article I'm getting there :)
Assuming you survive the experimental stage I suspect that thermal welding of ceramics using the right materials might prove to be a route to allow the creation of super strong structures with fairly primitive methods.
Do you say every little inconsequential thing that pops in to your head? I scan just to find the non-sequitors.
Larry King: "Kumquats... Now there's a weird fruit!"
Groan ...
Cement and mortars are a huge usage of both energy and significant source of C02 pollution.
Bricks even simple sun dried ones are easy enough to make. I feel a solar kiln is doable.
However mortar turns out to be problematic. Moving away from traditional solutions is certainly worthy of research.
And this.
A nice description of frit bonding its not exactly unknown and used in all kinds of industrial processes.
The nice thing about frit bonding is its "natural" if you can figure out how to melt the frit.
Thermite :)
Replacing a large scale fuel intensive industrial process with one that only depends on aluminum most often made via hydroelectric power is not a bad thing to think about. Frit bonding is something that to my knowledge has not been explored for building applications because of the required temperatures.
Thermite is the simplest way to create a high temperature over a region certainly literally gobs of other choices exist but they are more complex to manufacture.
And its not exactly a new idea just the application.
And no it did not just pop in my head I'm aware of all of these facts. My original concept was to simply used focused light on the frit but this does not seem viable for anything but the thinnest frit bond. The thermite approach which works makes it in my opinion worth talking about.
And more important the entire point is there are plenty of other ways to do things from the way we do them today.
Lots and lots of ways to solve problems. Glueing bricks together in and evironmentally distributed technology way that does not need heavy industry or lots of fuel is one of the basic problems it would be nice to have and alternative approach for.
Of course plenty of other choices also exist but like I said they many times are either fuel intensive or require advanced expensive synthetic compounds.
Developing a way that a poor subsistence farmer could build strong walls with local resources is a problem that I'm concerned about and its important. Given that billions live in squalor now and many more might be joining them working out ways they can create a good life for themselves is in my opinion important.
And although it may not sound like much gluing bricks together is a big problem. If this approach say only turned out to work for creating a solid floor to replace packed dirt in huts the increased hygiene alone could save thousands of lives. Frit bonding could or could not be the solution damn sure worth a try.
Memmel, being the great open-source coder that he is, essentially has written a software automaton that responds with drivel any comment that is directed at it. Let's see how it works this time.
WHT, I find your comment snarky and uncalled for (IMHO) and better left unsaid.
Huh?
What bee is up your bonnet? I enjoy reading memmel's posts. I don't always agree with everything but often he looks in places others don't.
I don't agree with anything he says. On one post this week, I took apart every paragraph he wrote and basically debunked every statement he made (save maybe one).
I wish someone was as harsh with the stuff I write, it eventually makes the argument more solid. However, it only works if the underlying argument holds some promise. Unfortunately, nothing that Memmel writes make sense at any level. If you can dig up a reasoned piece, let me know.
There are lots of things that he has said that makes sense.
But I have no intention of engaging you in this because your ego is clearly what is doing the talking right now and there is no real conversation possible when that's the case.
When you get off your high horse I'm happy to have a conversation.
My ego only talks when it gets bruised. So far that ain't happening.
Most people confuse confidence with ego, and they fear to engage with someone who shows confidence.
Look at how all the Rethugs quake in their boots when someone like Alan Grayson shows up. You can say that Grayson has a big ego or you can say that he is confident in his approach. I believe the latter. I won't let crap like Memmel flings around go unchallenged. His unremitting white noise is just as bad as if we had a cornucopian going wild on this forum without someone challenging him.
Wind powered reverse osmosis desalination plants are highly feasible and are being developed in use in various areas that lack drinkable water.
You don't need batteries or backup diesel generators because you can just store the desalinated water until needed. You can even leave out the electrical generator and drive the reverse osmosis unit directly off the wind turbine.
Here's an article about a pilot project in West Texas that can produce 30,000 gallons per day of drinking water from brackish ground water:
Here's an article about a Dutch direct-drive unit with no electrical generator:...
There are some areas of this discussion where I THINK I am clear on and others that I would love help on.
Clear: The U.S. in particular has now shown the world a poor example in increasing the money supply and debt to keep citizens happy. The world is learning (China's recent stimulus was larger than the U.S. stimulus) that they can print money also. Of course other countries would figure this out.
Clear: The U.S. along with many countries has inordinate debt, currently 53 trillion and growing, and when other countries are unwilling to continue to lend (which will happen)to the U.S., the U.S. will monetize the debt, creating inflation, so the debt can be paid off with cheaper dollars. Also, it is always more politically expedient to have inflation than unemployment. Interestingly reporting on M3, some say the best measure of total liquid funds, was simply discontinued recently.
Clear: Weak currencies and inflation will make energy more expensive in some countries than others. The price may go up everywhere but relatively much more in countries with weak currencies. This along with our inordinate energy useage will force relatively more change in the U.S. This is also likely why the dollar and oil are now so inversly tied togeather, a likely continuing negative feedback loop in terms of the price of oil in dollars.
Unclear/anyone who can help would be appreciated: The cost estimates I see on natural gas are all over the map. Credit Suisse had a recent estimate that $7 was required to cover costs and a reasonable profit margin and $13 for shale gas. On the other hand I keep on hearing about companies that say they can make a profit, even on shale gas, at perhaps $4, can anyone help?
Just entered the numbers for US (imported) oil from this table into Excel, plotted a chart, and got a worrying picture.
Year - EROI
1930 - 100
1970 - 30
1999 - 35
2005 - 18
2007 - 12
The chart predicts that EROI on imported oil will hit rock bottom (0) before 2012 if nothing changes and you just follow the trend. That means that the US might be able to still import oil and use the energy in that oil but that the world is draining energy if it keeps exporting to the US.
The US economy is being kept on life support, courtesy of the creditors (especially foreign creditors) who are funding our federal deficit. A question I have posed before: What happens when our foreign creditors decide that our high levels of oil consumption represent a bigger threat to the creditor countries than the benefit they get from selling us stuff (which we are basically buying with vendor financing)?
"what if they decided to husband their resources?"
Minerals, same same. Exports of REEs from China dropping, we're scrambling.
Vendor financing issue could be part of the problem and it would come out as a weak dollar (so the cost could be exorbitant anyway). I believe the Saudis in particular depend on us for both their food supplies and military protection. We get a lot of oil from nearby Canada (which is very tied to the U.S. for trade) and about 7% from nearby Mexico (while they have it).

Ok, as promised (from a couple of requests back home) I'm finally reporting on some of the holiday festivities that are going on around Florence! (complete with photos as usual!) Just after Halloween we began to see the stores putting up new window displays and the toy store that is next door to our apartment has a great display with a snow machine and miniature village that attracts crowds throughout the day. A couple times I've even had to push my way through just to put my key in our outside door. Then about 2 weeks ago we started seeing city workers with their large ladders putting up Christmas lights across many of the streets in the center. I kept wondering when they would finally turn them on, and then last weekend when our friends were visiting we saw the first ones lit! The major streets were not turned on yet, but at least it was a start. Then mid-week this week we saw Via Calzaiuoli (the main shopping street between the Duomo and Piazza Signoria - *see photo) finally gleaming with thousands and thousands of little sparkles. So now our evening walks are filled with beautiful Christmas lights, holiday store windows, and the occasional Christmas song coming from a street musician or cafe.
Also this week opened a German Christmas festival in the square at Santa Croce, one of the most famous churches in town. It is full of sausage, pastries, cheeses, candy, toys, and lights! We went one evening and had a fun time browsing at the stalls, but because this market will be held for another week or so, we will definitely return because I had my eyes on some tasty-looking donut things! There is even a cafe on a merry-go-round (that, fortunately for those stuffing big Wurstel in their mouths, doesn't move!)
We haven't decorated in our house yet, but I do think that we'll be shopping for some lovely Fiorentine paper this week to make a string of paper snowflakes for our livingroom. It's crazy to me how the time really is flying by here, and I'm forgetting how close Christmas really is...it's different not being around family and our friends from Florida. Today we played Christmas music for most of the time just for a reminder. We only have 2 weeks left of classes until we are off for a 3 week holiday. This week, there are several to-do's on my list, including getting Christmas cards made, deciding on where we want to go for several days during our break (we've narrowed it down to about 4 Italian excursions), and buying a couple of small gifts for exchange parties coming up.
...lots more to come, including the best tree we've found so far in the city!

Aren't decorations fun? well, as long as you're able to get to open your door :)
This year I've actually gotten to enjoy the holiday season more than the previous years... but like you said, time's flying by!
Erin - I love your pictures - but can you post them a bit bigger??? I love those in-your-face pics and I would love to see more detail of yours - they seem great!
Your photos have helped me get into the Christmas spirit. I know I have some lights around here somewhere.
Wonderful photos! Thank you!
Sara: funny you mentioned the photo enlarging b/c just this week I've been searching through other ways (without using Flickr, which I may have to revert to) where I can store hi-res photos b/c we're running VERY low on our personal website bandwidth (which I used to post on there b/c people could enlarge them...)
so hopefully soon we'll find a solution :)
christmas time in Florence (or flotown as we call it) it wonderful...Italians are so festive :-)
