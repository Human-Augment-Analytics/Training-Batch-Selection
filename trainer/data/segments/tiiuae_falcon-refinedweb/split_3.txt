Modern Combat 2: How to Kill Nikitich

BP Settlement Of Little Comfort To Some, A 'Down Payment' To Others
Originally published on Thu November 15, 2012 5:36 pm
There's mixed reaction this afternoon to the news that BP has agreed to a deal with federal authorities to pay $4.5 billion in criminal and civil penalties related to the 2010 Gulf Oil spill.
Massachusetts Rep. Ed Markey, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, calls the fines and penalties appropriate. "People died, BP lied to Congress, and millions of barrels of oil poured into the Gulf," he says. "This steep cost to BP will provide the Gulf coast some of the funds needed to restore the region, and will hopefully deliver some comfort and closure to the families and businesses affected by the spill."
But the news is little comfort to some families. Baton Rouge attorney Chris Jones lost his 28-year-old brother, Gordon Jones, in the Deepwater Horizon explosion. He says BP has never apologized to his family, and is only cutting a deal with the federal government to resume business.
"I just want Gordon back but that's not going to happen," Jones says. "Unfortunately all BP has to do is write a check and they're back in operation."
On the Gulf Coast, the settlement comes as a reminder of what the region suffered, both economically and environmentally when BP's blown-out Macondo well spewed uncontrolled for nearly 3 months.
"You would want to think it was really just an accident," says Mike Voisin, a seventh-generation Louisiana oysterman who chairs the Gulf Seafood Marketing Coalition. "But if things happened that were criminal than it makes it maybe more than just an accident."
Voisin says it's a relief that federal prosecutors are holding BP accountable, and says all the parties should work diligently to make sure a disaster of this magnitude never happens again.
Today's agreement only covers federal criminal charges and civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission. BP remains in talks with the Justice Department and state governments to resolve a civil lawsuit that could lead to billions of dollars in additional fines and charges under the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act.
Larry Schweiger, president of the National Wildlife Federation, calls the criminal settlement "a good down payment" on restoration of the Gulf and its communities. "We look forward to working toward a full settlement that will not only hold BP and all other parties responsible for the devastation of the Gulf oil disaster, but deter future violations by sending a clear message that America holds reckless polluters fully accountable," he says.
In Alabama, where beaches were oiled and the state's tourist industry suffered a financial blow, Attorney General Luther Strange says he's still preparing to press the state's case that BP was grossly negligent. "BP's criminal acts levied economic and environmental damages of historic proportions upon Alabama, and these damages are not covered under today's agreement," Strange says.
A New Orleans federal judge has set a February trial date for the federal and state civil claims against BP. Separately, the company has agreed to pay an estimated $7.8 billion dollars to settlement economic and medical claims brought individuals and businesses affected by the oil spill.

'Dirty' Politics As Usual In South?
South Carolinians are voting today in the GOP primary, which some pundits see as the candidates' last stand for getting the GOP nomination to run in the general election.
On weekends on All Things Considered today, host Guy Raz talked with Danielle Vinson, the chair of the political science department at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., about what is often considered "dirty" South Carolina primary politics.
"If you don't come of out here with a first or second place, it's hard to keep going," she says. "So by the time they get here everybody takes off the gloves."
One of the most famous examples she cites is a whisper campaign during the 2000 presidential primary that falsely claimed then-candidate John McCain of fathering an illegitimate child with a black prostitute.
Vinson says this type of campaigning goes back to at least the '70s, if not before.))

Senate Mostly Blamed For Agency And Court Vacancies, But Obama Isn't Helping

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep.
Some workers dream about having no boss. Thousands of federal workers are living that dream. Many Federal agencies, commissions and courts are operating without permanent leadership. Sometimes the White House has been slow to nominate anyone. Often the Senate has not confirmed President Obama's nominees.
New York University's Paul Light says Republican senators have strategic reasons to confirm nominees very slowly.
PAUL LIGHT: It's a Napoleonic approach to defeating the president and reducing big government. I mean if you don't like the law, the Constitution is quite explicit. You're obligated to repeal the law. But in recent decades that has all changed. If you don't like a law now, and you can't repeal it, decapitate the agency and eviscerate its capacity to execute the law.
INSKEEP: For example, keep it from having any administration-appointed senior officials. Just to be clear, this has nothing to do with automatic spending cuts or any of the other budget battles in Washington. It's a story of hiring, or not hiring, key members of an administration.
We're going to talk about the effects with a group of NPR correspondents, starting with NPR's Brian Naylor.
Brian, good morning.
BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.
INSKEEP: How many agencies, commissions, courts are we talking about here?
NAYLOR: Well, according to one count from the folks at ProPublica, there are 68 vacant positions at the end of the president's first term, which is more than the previous two administrations.
INSKEEP: And we're not just talking about 68 jobs. This is 68 top jobs here.
NAYLOR: These are top jobs. There's a key Medicare agency that hasn't had a permanent director since 2006. The Federal Election Commission, which has had commissioners held over on expired terms. There's the National Labor Relations Board, which President Obama filled with some recess appointments, but those were deemed unconstitutional by a federal appeals court - though they still remain in office. There are also plenty of lower level vacancies that the administration hasn't gotten around to filling so far, but those have less of an impact.
INSKEEP: OK. So elections, the workplace, Medicare, Medicaid, these are agencies that have something to say about huge swaths of American life. What is the effect of them not having heads?
NAYLOR: Well, you know, just imagine. I mean they're treading water on policy and personnel issues, sometimes key decisions get put off, and frankly lost opportunity. If you're the president and you don't have your folks in place, it's a lost opportunity to affect policy.
INSKEEP: All right. You mentioned a Medicare agency. Let's bring in NPR's Julie Rovner, who covers health policy. Julie, what is that agency and what's the effect here?
JULIE ROVNER, BYLINE: It's the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It's actually a lot bigger than that. It handles not only Medicare and Medicaid, but the Children's Heath Insurance Program and now a big chunk of the Affordable Care Act. Together, in 2011, it handled about 21 percent of the budget, $769 billion - that was bigger, by some accounts, than the Defense Department. And as you mentioned, there has not been a Senate-confirmed head since 2006. So that dates back to the Bush administration.
INSKEEP: So we hear about the defense secretary. We just had a confirmation battle over the defense secretary. This is somebody whose job in dollar terms is perhaps bigger.
ROVNER: That is correct. And...
INSKEEP: Who is it right now?
ROVNER: It is right now, there is an acting administrator, Marilyn Tabner; she's been acting for about a year. Before that there had been another acting administrator, Don Berwick, who is respected by just about every health authority in the United States, apparently, except the United States Senate, who refused to confirm him. Before that the Democrats refused to confirm the last Bush appointee. And now, of course, it became a huge conflagration over the Affordable Care Act; that's why the Republicans said they would filibuster first Don Berwick and now they're not so sure about Marilyn Tabner. So again, there's simply been an acting director of this agency.
INSKEEP: OK. Let me bring in NPR's Yuki Noguchi, who covers financial matters - because there's a special battle over the head of a particular agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which you cover.
YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Yeah. That has a director, Richard Cordray, who was appointed through a recess appointment, which is now being disputed. And the Republicans in the Senate are angry about that appointment not because they have objections to Cordray himself, but because they don't like the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They say it has too much power.
INSKEEP: They don't like what the agency is doing or set up to do.
NOGUCHI: Well, they want to have the final say-so on what the bureau writes in terms of rules.
INSKEEP: And this is why the president, unable to get his nominee through the Senate, effectively did it himself, and now this is a matter for the courts?
NOGUCHI: It is a matter for the courts to decide. And then also he's been re-nominated so there will be a hearing next week.
INSKEEP: OK. So we have that situation. We have the Medicare situation. There's even more. I'd like to know from you, Brian Naylor, who's still with us - are these delays normal? Is this the normal way of doing business in Washington?
NAYLOR: Well, it's sort of become the new normal. It used to be that senators would hold nominations because they wanted to extract something - some personal favor from the administration. But that is pretty rare, those sorts of personal holds. Right now it's more of an institutional, we-won't-even-bring-this-up-for-a-vote kind of thing.
INSKEEP: It's a power grab. That might be a rude term for it. But that's what you're saying - the Senate is asserting more power than they've had in the past.
NAYLOR: That's right.
INSKEEP: OK. Let's discuss the courts. And NPR's justice correspondent, Carrie Johnson, covers that area. What does it mean to not have scores of federal judges filling particular spots on the bench?
CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Steve, nearly 90 judgeships are vacant. About 30 of those are considered judicial emergencies. That means the caseloads in those courts are very, very high. And the impact is that judges who are currently on the bench are hearing lots more cases. And there's a huge impact too on senior or retired judges, judges who agree to hear a few cases now and then...
INSKEEP: They un-retire now...
JOHNSON: Well, many of them are hearing a full caseload and some of them are even doing what's called circuit riding, which back in the day meant riding your horse to another location and hearing cases in that location to help that court out. A lot of senior judges are doing that. One from Washington, D.C. recently went to Atlanta to help out with that court's caseload. That's happening more and more.
INSKEEP: And the cost of horse feed, I imagine, is going through the roof here.
JOHNSON: Or at least airline tickets.
INSKEEP: Airline tickets - what it would be today. There is the old saying that justice delayed is justice denied. Is justice being delayed for a lot of criminal defendants here?
JOHNSON: What happens in these cases is that criminal matters get priority. So the delays are mostly happening on the civil side. However, that can have a huge impact on the lives of ordinary people. People contesting or challenging a denial of Social Security benefits, people who have personal injury lawsuits, and many people who are challenging denial of, say, their military benefits - all of those people have righteous disputes and they need them heard quickly.
INSKEEP: Let me come back to Brian Naylor here, because Brian, at the beginning we had a political scientist who said this was a Republican strategy, a Napoleonic effort to take down the administration. Is that - if you talk to Republicans in the Senate, would they admit that's what they're doing?
NAYLOR: I think they might in some of their more honest moments, or off the record. But some of the blame has to fall on the administration itself, the Obama administration, previous administrations, for not aggressively pursuing some of these nominations, for letting some of these vacancies just remain vacant. And there's also an incredibly intrusive process to become a nominee. They want to know a lot about your background, a lot about your finances. And for some nominees, I think it makes it more difficult for the administration to get nominees for some of these positions. People say it's just not worth it.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Brian Naylor along with NPR's Julie Rovner, Yuki Noguchi and Carrie Johnson, telling us about headless government agencies. Thanks to you all.
JOHNSON: Thank you.
ROVNER: Thanks, Steve.
INSKEEP: Another Democratic president has evolved on gay marriage. Bill Clinton says he now opposes the Defense of Marriage Act. Clinton was considered supportive of gay rights in the 1990s, though the end result was often messy and much-debated compromises, like the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which has since been repealed. When President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, it prevented the federal government from recognizing gay marriages in any way. Now the former president has written an article for the Washington Post. He says he only signed the Defense of Marriage Act in order to head off a movement for even stronger measures. And he says he has come to the conclusion that the Defense of Marriage Act is, quote, "incompatible with our constitution." Two weeks ago, the Obama administration also took an official stand against that law, calling it a harsh form of discrimination. And later this month, the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that challenges the law. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

Marine Debris community meetings on the way
The Washington Marine Debris Task Force released its initial plan for responding to various types of debris that may cross the Pacific Ocean and reach our shores from the Japan tsunami.
The task force is in the process of scheduling community meetings in Ocean Shores, Long Beach, and Port Angeles. Dates and times will be announced when the meetings are set.
Gov. Chris Gregoire established the task force to coordinate state, federal and local activities to monitor and respond appropriately to marine debris along the coast.
NOAA predicts debris will show up on Washington’s shores intermittently during the next several years, although it is unknown exactly what, how much and when.
Washington saw a spike in amounts of marine debris on its coastal beaches in June but the quantity washing ashore since decreased significantly in the months following.
Anyone who encounters debris should not touch or attempt to move it. Instead people should immediately call 1-855-WACOAST (1-855-922-6278).

If You Want Reasoned Discourse...
I had lunch today with Mr. WhyDoesAnyoneNeeda and Mr. IfItSavesOnlyOneChild...
(I should get a friggin' Oscar from my performance as "Ogre Not Dismembering Clueless Progressives That Soooo Desperately Deserve It")
I need to write up some ground rules for lunchtime conversation in order to keep my sanity...
1. Do your homework. (a/k/a You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.)
When you use "semi-auto rifle" and "machine gun" or "magazine" and "clip" interchangeably, your level of credibility drops considerably. Also- when you ask if my guns are "registered", you are showing your ignorance in extremis.
2. Using buzzwords will get you filed under M for "Misguided and Misled".
When you start using all the current Obama Administration-approved nomenclature like "Military-Style Assault Rifle", "High Capacity Clips" and "Cop Killer Bullets", well, it just indicates to my that you don't want to have a discussion, you just want to lecture me on your position.
3. Know Your Stats, and their background.
For instance: 40% of gun transactions are unregulated? Really?
That "40%" figure is one of the best examples of cherry-picking statistics. Read some of the facts here.
4. Don't discuss Gun Show Loopholes, and Internet Gun Purchases unless you have first-hand experience.
Because when you tell me about thousands of people people buying guns on the Internet and how it circumvents background checks, I will laugh in your face. And if you tell me you can go down to the gunshow and buy a machine gun, it will be doubly amusing and chortle-worthy.
5. Name Calling (gun nuts, right wing wackos, bitter clingers, Dirty Harry wannabes with a tiny penii) will require me to end the discussion and depart the premises before finishing tiffin. (And I just hate not finishing my tiffin.) It just shows you are unwilling to discuss things rationally and are just one step from going Godwin on me... At that point I will start feeling embarassed that I even know you.
6. On the "If it only saves one child it will be worth it..." topic...
Why aren't you crusading against drunk drivers, bee stings, child abuse & neglect, swimming pool accidents etc. ad infinitum ...
(Actually I know the answer to that...
Once you have my my icky guns, then you'll come for my booze, swimming pool and my apiary...)

Welcome to Blue Monday
So- Blue Monday
Feel like crap today?
Here's why:
Cliff Arnall (the phlogiston scientist that came up with this crap) says the date was calculated by using many factors, including: weather conditions, debt level (the difference between debt accumulated and our ability to pay), time since Christmas, time since failing our new year’s resolutions, low motivational levels and feeling of a need to take action.
This date allegedly falls on the Monday of the last full week of January. The date was first declared to be 24 January in 2005.
In 2011 there was confusion about the correct date; some claimed it to be 17 January 2011 while others stated Blue Monday was on 24 January 2011. In 2012, the most depressing day of the year was said to be 23 January.
Calculation
According to a press release by a mental health charity, the formula is:
(in case you want to waste your valuable time thinking about this...)
d=debt,
T=time since Christmas,
Q=time since failing our new year’s resolutions,
M=low motivational levels
and Na = the feeling of a need to take action
'D' is not defined in the release, nor are units.
(Personally I think D=the current level of Dumbassery in the current administration, contributing to the overall malaise in the country - TBG)
Writing about the calculation, Ben Goldacre stated: ... the fact is that Cliff Arnall's equations ... fail even to make mathematical sense on their own terms.
Really Ben, y'think?

How To Piss Off the TSA
Travel hour 19, 10:01am PST
LAX Airport.
Going through security after clearing customs... I get turned down to go through TSA PreCheck, so I'm back with the idiots that don't know you have to empty your pockets and take off your shoes. Morons.
But I'm more pissed at the TSA...
Sooo... In for a dime, in for a dollar.
I put my bag and skateboard on the XRay belt, along with the bin with shoes, belt and pocket goodies.
I announce (loudly):
"My iPad is in the back pocket of my bag... Just so you TSA iPad thieves know where it is...save you some time."
The three TSOs working that lane shot me some dirty looks, and after I pass the metal detector, a supervisor waddled over...
"Sir, there is no need for that kind of talk. Why would you want to do that?"
"Ma'am, how many terrorists have been caught by the TSA? And how many TSA agents have been arrested for stealing passenger's items?"
"But sir, that is just a tiny number of bad agents...most of us are honest hard-working people. Why do you want to treat us all...like...criminals..?"
My point was sinking in, but I wanted to make sure...
"Exactly. You treat us like everyone is a terrorist, I'll treat you all like thieves. I think the odds of me being correct is much higher than yours."
She opened her mouth to refute me, but thought better of it.
8 more hours to go... Next stop Houston.

Ruminations On A Common Argument
When I discuss that the main reason is not about hunting or target shooting- they idea was to fight tyranny - to keep the Government from getting oppressive AGAIN and the populace being unable to implement a draconian solution, people love to argue about capability.
"You're going to take on the US Army/National Guard/Obama's Brownshirts/Police?"
The obvious answer is 'Yes.'
There are 2 aspects of this- one is, will the US Army/National Guard/Police actually enforce a disarmament/confiscation order? If Katerina is any indication, the answer is yes...
If THAT happens, then a whole new kettle of fish starts to boil- to wit: Insurgencies.
I was watching a series here in Sydney that follows a EOD team in Afghanistan on their daily routine.
It's some pretty hairy stuff... Some pretty primitive IEDs and the weapon of choice for the enemy being a AK 47...
But it got me thinking-
If the situation was turned around- if Threepers in the US, with the access to chemicals and some much better long-distance weaponry, comms hardware- etc, wanted to make life miserable for the forces that are tasked to do the collecting... Well... The Brownshirts will encounter situations / conditions that will make Afghanistan look like taking candy from a baby.
(Maybe a better analogy is needed... Have you ever TRIED taking candy from a baby?)
Regardless- the Left seems to think most US gun owner are just gap-toothed slack-jawed droolers who wear camo and can only shout "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED!"...or are they just 'projecting'?
Perhaps they are the victims of a exceptionally biased media that only wants to show the fringe elements that advance their agenda, and are incapable of understanding the breadth and depth of the intelligence and capabilities of law-abiding gun owners...
I think, should push come to shove, things will be quite different than they imagine.
I can just see my man McThag as a latter-day Francis Marion, sabotaging the Brownshirts from a base deep in the swamps of Free Florida Territories...
Keep your powder dry...

More conspicuous consumption and waste in an age where we must now finally grow up and conserve what is important.
It is time to put aside childish things. Your hero, Obama’s words.
This is what he was talking about.
[...] LACMA’s blog says it’s “actually nothing more than floor-to-ceiling strands of thousands of household containers procured from local 99¢ stores.” [...]
I don’t think this is what Obama was talking about, Donald. You should lighten up and stop being so angry
The colors are pretty and fun to look at. They make me happy, and I look forward to touching them!
“More conspicuous consumption and waste”
I think that is part of the statement they are trying to make. Try reading between the lines.
There is nothing to read, it is entertainment, stop asking such shallow and absurd questions. They mean nothing. And are a waste of time, and most certainly are NOT art.
Like I said, at the Childrens museum, fine, in a limited way. But then, children took over art long ago, and made it irrelevant to society. And so the numbers who go are down, and ages up, as few go to see such nonsense as this, except art school grads, Now thats a childish endeavor. Art is OUT THERE, go live it, and you will see the inanity of such “works” as this andd most else of the last few decades. Art has been forgotten, and become a lifestyle, fashion, and entertainment.
Not creative art.
And so
art collegia delenda est
art colleges must be destroyed, the inmates have taken over the asylum, no great artist has ever graduated from one. Art is about living, not about sheltered academic doodling.
Imperial Clothing, read it.
I agree in not producing excess waste, but in defence of the artist, everything used in this installation can easily be re used. Doesn’t seem at all wasteful to me.
Installations are “creative art” as much as any other artform. They just aren’t for everyone. I’m not a fan of 90% of what I see in galleries, but I still respect it. You can’t please everyone. If you could, life, and art would be boring.
Oh yeah! Outsanding colors, and the best part is YOU’RE ALLOWED TO TOUCH! Woohoo! I hate keeping my hands in my pockets.

Last month we told you we had acquired Manuel Arellano’s 1691 painting Virgin of Guadalupe. Now we can report that it’s on view in our Latin American galleries. You may have seen Christopher Knight’s post at Culture Monster earlier this week, which also included a video of the original Virgin of Guadalupe, hanging in the Guadalupe Basilica in Mexico City.
You can see the Virgin of Guadalupe as soon as you enter the top floor of the Art of the Americas Building. It practically calls out to you, asking you to pass through three other galleries on your way to view it up close. But don’t pass too quickly! On your way you’ll pass Diego Rivera’s masterpiece Flower Day and our other recent acquisition, Roberto Matta’s Burn, Baby, Burn.
Speaking personally, probably one of the most valuable things I’ve gotten from working at LACMA in the last few years has been an appreciation for Latin American art—all eras and all varieties. It started, for me, with the mesmerizing Arts in Latin America, 1492–1820, a special exhibition from 2007. It was one of those rare exhibitions that knocked me off my feet precisely because I walked in with no expectations—I didn’t think it would be “my thing.” I was wrong. Then we reinstalled the ancient American galleries with the help of a gallery design by Jorge Pardo. The installation was controversial —does the design distract from the objects? Mine is just one opinion, but if you ask me, no. Pardo’s gallery design made me look at the objects with fresh eyes, made me consider the stylistic choices these ancient artists were making compared to those working at the same time in, say, Europe or the Middle East. Sure, you could make that comparison without Pardo’s help—the differences were always there—but I hadn’t taken the time before. Again, it wasn’t “my thing” until I saw it in this new light.
At the same time, we reinstalled our permanent collection of Latin American art from the Spanish colonial era to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Walking through these galleries again yesterday, on the way to see the Virgin of Guadalupe, I was reminded again how much this collection impresses me. The Matta, the paintings by Rivera and Tamayo, the religious-themed paintings sharing the gallery with Arellano’s Virgin. And then there’s the contemporary gallery, which features probably three or four of my favorite twentieth and twenty-first–century works in the whole museum, including works by Francis Alÿs, Cildo Meireles, Mathias Goeritz, and Jesús Rafael Soto (visitors to the museum making a point to hit up BCAM and the Ahmanson Building’s modern galleries would do well not to forget about this gallery).
The new acquisition of the Arellano’s Virgin of Guadalupe is reason enough to come up to these galleries—just be sure you take in everything else while you’re here.
Beautiful painting!
I am on the LACMA Docent Council, and although I too did not think the exhibition was my thing, I volunteered to tour it. I found it a wonderful experience and was delighted by the students’ responses – especially to Arellano’s painting. Many were familiar with the story, many saw the painting as an object of veneration, many wanted to return with their families.
Virgin of Guadalupe is such a mystical representation. A definate must see of this painting up close.
<|endofexample|>
I am often surprised by the subtle connections that can be drawn between LACMA’s exhibitions. Just yesterday I headed to the Pavilion for Japanese Art to see Fracture: Daido Moriyama, the first museum exhibition in Los Angeles devoted solely to the Japanese photographer best known for his gritty depictions of Japanese city life. The exhibition features black-and-white photos from early in Moriyama’s career, as well as some of his more recent color photographs.
Having travelled to Japan a couple of years ago, I was curious to compare my own memories of Tokyo and Shinjuku with Moriyama’s images. To me, while chaotic, most of Tokyo is the pinnacle of order, efficiency, and cleanliness. Where I visited, there was barely a single piece of trash on the street and not a single person coughed in public without attempting to cover his or her mouth. As I mentioned, certain areas were certainly chaotic—Shibuya, in particular (think those gigantic crosswalks where hundreds of pedestrians swarm into the intersection from every direction)—but even that frenzy is reined in by an impulse toward order (red hand means stop and they stop).

I ended up having a much more visceral response than I expected to Moriyama’s images. The textures in his photos—the fuzz of a young boy’s buzz cut, water splashing off of the scales of fish that are systematically being pulled from the water by an industrial fishing line—left an existential grit on my skin, in my mouth. I could taste the saltiness of the tears of post–World War II Japan; I could feel the smog in my lungs, the grease on my fingers of defiant and rapid industrialization/westernization of a country determined to bounce back.

Truthfully, it almost became too much for me to bear . . . until I came across two photos. The first is one called Beauty Parlor, Tokyo (c. 1975). The photo appears to be a close-up of a beauty parlor advertisement: a radiant Japanese woman—skin and blouse blazing white—set against a dark, dirty street, the black-dusted sky crisscrossed by low-hanging power lines. While, in theory, this is the ultimate cynical statement about the westernization of Japan—the emphasis on production and economic growth veiled only slightly by the western ideal of beauty—I still found this photo to be oddly stimulating. That girl looks fun. She looks like she would appear in a Haruki Murakami novel hanging out in a jazz club with a talking cat.
Beach Boys, Zushi, Japan, 1967, printed 2009, the Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser Collection of Photographs, courtesy Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser, © 2012 Daido Moriyama
The second photo that lifted my spirits is called Beach Boys, Zushi, Japan (1967). I was immediately drawn to this photo. For one, it’s fairly large—hard to miss. But the composition of the photo is also alluring. The men’s bodies are reclined at the same angle on the beach, each body glistening. It’s almost as if their bodies have been lapped up onto the beach by waves—handsome fish beached on the shore. I also like this photo because these guys remind me of the Japanese men in my life—my father, my grandfather who passed away last week, and my father-in-law. All three of them were good-looking chaps during that era, if not in a Japanese-boy-band kind of way.
I pondered these Japanese men in their fashionable swim trunks, another LACMA exhibition came to mind: California Design, 1930–1965: “Living in a Modern Way.” With Moriyama’s postwar psychological burden placed firmly on my shoulders, I walked over to the Resnick Pavilion for some levity. Maybe in my mind I thought I could make a connection between these sunbathers in the land of the rising sun and the Catalina Sportswear bathing suits that are featured in the exhibition.
Installation view, California Design, 1930–1965: “Living in a Modern Way,” October 1, 2011–June 3, 2012, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, photo © 2012 Museum Associates/LACMA
The exhibition itself is light, airy, and colorful, with the clean lines of mid-century design and a mix of wood, metal, and textiles (it closes June 3 btw!). My first, if not misguided, thought was, “Wow, this is how the winners prospered!” What I meant by that is that postwar America—in this case California—seemed to really embrace the hope that the defeat of Germany and Japan in World War II brought. It was an extraordinary time in the history of California art and design. People took advantage of the ramped-up domestic economy and industry to create some astonishing things—to create a distinct style and lifestyle that they exported (Japan imported its fair share, no doubt). Obviously other things were going on that made this era so lush with creativity in California. However, to me, juxtaposing the two exhibitions helps to contextualize the time and place of the artists in each.
None of this is to say that Japan was all gloom and doom. The Japanese created some extraordinary art during that time—I think that it just germinated from a different philosophical seed than that of California artists. But don’t take my word for it: Check out Fracture: Daido Moriyama for yourself, which is on view through July 31. Also, LACMA is presenting a film series, High and Low: Postwar Japan in Black and White, along with the Fracture, starting tomorrow night through Saturday, and then it picks up again June 8–9.

What a rich and informative piece and I loved the history and the personal tie-in. Good stuff !
Isn’t it oddly patronizing or, in a way, peculiarly discriminatory (or group-think centric) to have photography — even more so if it’s very much from the recent past — in the Japanese Pavilion merely because the works in question were taken by a person from Japan? Why isn’t such an exhibit held in the galleries for contemporary or modern art?
The strategy behind such an arrangement points to either purposeful or inadvertent segregation—naive, ignorant or otherwise.
I agree w Concord. I believe Moriyama’s more than an ambassador of Japan, I find it slightly undermining to not have put this (very, very small) collection elsewhere. I guess without Moriyama’s prints there, the pavilion would have been completely empty when I went.
I was disapointed by the “Exhibition prints” of the more recent color work… not for the quality of the images but for how they were presented, pinned to the wall and probably to be destroyed once the show is over. Moriyama is not getting the attention he deserves here.
Daido Moriyama is such an inspiration to myself. Visited studio Place M, Shinjuku, what a great place for photographers to exhibit. Love the rawness of his work.

Well team, I must say, I was very impressed with the response to Week One of the Friday Football Foodie Training Camp. The general response was overwhelming, and a few fine readers took the time to send in photos of your very own Pizza Loaves.
With that type of enthusiasm, I really think we have a real shot of making the playoffs here.
But we cannot go into the season without trying out some new plays. The Pizza Loaf is a good go-to running play, but you’re also going to need a new quick 15-yard slant pass because last year? You dropped the ball every time you pulled out a bag of Funions instead of going for something a little more substantive.
We’re trying out something new this week, a menu that with a little fine tuning, could become our next 3 and 8 play.
Friday Football Foodie – Buffalo Chicken Dip, Stoli Blueberri Fizz, and New Snack Review of the Week: Pringles Select Sweet Potato Chips
You will need…
2 8oz packages of cream cheese
1 cup blue cheese or ranch dressing
3/4-1 cup of Monterrey Jack cheese (Or white cheddar, or mozzarella, or whatever you have handy, aside of maybe gouda)
1/2 cup blue cheese (optional)
fresh chives or green onions to taste
3/4 cup Franks Red Hot Sauce Original (Yes, the Original. They make a buffalo style sauce, but there is no need for “soybean oil and buttery flavoring” when you have next…)
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons chopped garlic – really – use as much or as little garlic as you like.
2 cups shredded chicken
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
A note about the chicken – The easiest way to get two cups of shredded chicken is to use the chicken in a can. But unless you’re making a casserole that also involves a can of Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup, you’re going to for fresher chicken. For the same price as two cans of chicken, you can pick up a roasted 2 pound chicken in the deli, which will be fall-off-the-bone moist and give you tastier results. (The dip is the Ravens and you just got Willis McGahee and released Jamal Lewis.)
If you already have chicken at home, either bake or poach two to three chicken breasts and then shred those with a fork.
Saute garlic over medium low heat. (If you opted out of the garlic, skip this step and just melt down your butter. Do not scald it and make it turn brown rookie, or you’ll be on clean up patrol.)
Add chicken and Red Hot sauce and heat throughly. Now, if you want more kick here, feel free to use more hot sauce or give it a couple of dashes of “Dave’s Super Hot Melt Your Toes Off Sauce.” Since this was the first time I made this dish, I didn’t want to get too fancy and just used the Frank’s Red Hot. I thought it was spicy enough, but there is always some jerk at a party who says “Needs more heat,” as if one can prove the size of their stones by how hot food is. Keep a special bottle of “Mega Hot Death” on the side for them to use, and know that they’ll regret the extra heat in the morning.
Layer into casserole dish. I made a mistake here. I should have used a larger – maybe a 9 x 13 inch – dish here. This is training camp and it is okay to make a mistake now, but you better believe when it is game time, I will use a shallower dish.
Give your skillet a quick clean off, or use a second skillet.
Melt cream cheese over medium-low heat. I am not kidding about the “low” in the description. Any hotter and you’re going to burn the cheese. Resist dipping bagels into pan or suddenly making cream cheese wontons.
Reduce heat and add blue cheese dressing. Work quickly! No burning the mixture!
Add chives/green onions. Just so you can say you had your greens for the day.
Pour over chicken. Again, looking at the reel, I really should have used a larger dish and spread out the coverage more.
Bake for 20 minutes or until bubbling at the edges, and then add your cheese on top. If you add it any sooner, it will form a hard crust on top, and no one needs to have to struggle with a dip when it is already a struggle to watch Nate Washington drop the ball. Again.
Bake 15-20 more minutes, or until cheese is melted.
Serve with crackers and crudite. Another training camp mistake. Most of the recipes for this dip I read suggested serving the dip with the Chicken in a Biskit crackers. Never, ever again will I allow that much salty food on to the field at one time. You cannot go for the long run when you are retaining 17 gallons of water. It’s a hardy dip, and works well with the celery. Need to scout out less salty crackers or chips for the next time.
Do not let one person hog the whole dip. Especially when that person is going to get bored with pre-season games early and go and play golf instead.
Not bad for a first try. It was actually was a fantastic dip, saltiness of crackers and too deep to handle mistakes aside. But this is why we train in the first place.
Stoli Blueberri Fizz
You will need…
Blueberri Stoli
Lemonade
Ginger Ale
Blueberries
Ice
Muddle blueberries at the bottom of a glass with either a muddler or a fork.
Add ice and a generous pour of Stoli Blueberri – not seen here as I don’t need you people judging me. Conversely, if you do not consume alcohol, just double up on the ginger ale and used more blueberries in the muddling step so you get the same fruit taste.
Add about a shot (2 ounces) of ginger ale. Just enough for a light fizz in the drink.
Fill the rest of the way with lemonade. I was as shocked as you were that there was still room in the glass.
Garnish with more blueberries, to give yourself the appearance of getting in a full serving of fruit.
Enjoy. While not quite as potent as the Watermelon Slushees, they still have a little bit of a punch so two before game time will have you good and ready to go.
New Snack Review of the Week: Pringles Select Sweet Potato Chips
Sometimes it is nice to have something soothing and sweet to go along with the spicy and hot, and cinnamon sweet potato chips are the perfect foil to the Buffalo Chicken Dip. These sweet chips are light in texture, and at 150 calories for 28 chips, (although the 9 grams of fat is a little high), it’s not a bad alternative to say, actual candy.
NEXT WEEK – TBD – PROBABLY INVOLVES CORN DOGS
I love the word ‘muddle’…
Muddle the blueberries!!!
Oh…my. Must try Buffalo Chicken Dip.
As I live in Canada, I have never heard of Chicken in a Biskit crackers. Do they have some odd chicken-like flavour to them?
yes they taste like a cracker soaked in chicken bullion. In my opinion they are just horrible, they are perfect if you are trying to dehydrate yourself quickly though.
I love making that chicken dip, my aunt gave the exact (and I mean down to the butter and garlic and Frank’s Hot Sauce) recipe. I must add chives the next time though.
Thank god I read this around lunch time, otherwise my boss would be angry with me for taking a chicken break at 10:15 AM.
WE HAVE THE SAME GLASSES WE ARE TWINSIES.
And lainie, trust me, you’re better off.
That dip looks delicious. I cannot wait to try it. My pizza loaf turned out great.
I’ve made the dip before, but w/out the garlic and chives. It was really good, but when I make it for my fantasy draft next week I am definitely going to add those in. Also Tostitos scoops work well w/it–a really good dip-to-chip ratio so less overall salt!
Those sweet potato chips look freaking awesome! I must have some!
Oh my god, fantasy draft! Thistle, you are a genius! I’m finally getting to have a live, in-person fantasy draft and I am TOTALLY making this. What a great idea!
I like to dip Pita Chips in my Buffalo Chicken Dip, but I admit that celery seems to be the ideal dip vehicle.
Yum!
I love this feature and that cowboy hat is splendid.
That is all.
TSW…my sister-in-law makes this, and serves it with Fritos Scoops. May I say….awesome!
[by the way...my first post over here]
Fine, we won’t judge you on the booze. But you left yourself wide open with the diet ginger ale.
It all looks good.
I didn’t know they made 10-gallon Steeler hats.
As a born and raised Buffalonian (I think I made that up), I completely approve of that recipe. The butter is completely necessary, it is part of what makes the wings so delicious. Some days living in healthy california is a real bummer.
All recipes need extensive testing, so I made the buffalo chicken dip for dinner a few nights ago. FABULOUS. I baked mine in two little crocks, and I had it with carrot surfboards and Tostitos Gold chips. Yum.
I’m disappointed TSW isn’t rocking the I-beam hat from the ’90s. Maybe she’s saving it for next week.
One of my mom’s friends was making buffalo chicken dip last Christmas and was supposed to send me the recipe. His version used Cheddar cheese and had it mixed in while the chicken was still in the skillet. I’ll have to try this version for my fantasy draft in three weeks.
However, I may make blueberry fizzes this weekend. I love the Stoli Blueberi.
I couldn’t find the final step in the chicken dip recipe. You know… the one that explains how I bribe you into bringing two trays of it to my fantasy football draft.
I kid… I kid…
Looks amazing. I will have to make that soon. I love using the whole rotisserie chickens for dishes like this. I like to put one in my Zatarain’s Jambalaya.
My pizza loaf sucked when I tried it after making it, but oddly it was delicious the next day reheated. Go figure.
Oh, that looks like an excellent dip. Me, I like to make my artichoke dip (which is cream cheese-y, like this one) in my little crockpot so it stays warm all game long.
What of chili? Is that part of your repertoire, TSW?
TSW, why, oh why must you keep posting kick ass recipes when I am the midst of my most prolonged (albeit successful) weight loss program of my life.
Screw it, I’m still trying this one as well. Keep up the great work.
Oh lord, I don’t even want to try and calorie counter this recipe. The drink looks fantastic though!
Yostal, you can enjoy these fine recipes and maintain your diet, if you just start every morning with a liter of Jack Daniels and 16 lines of coke.
I’m starting to think that TSW doesn’t want anyone to see what she really looks like.
My arteries do not thank you, but I do.

Oh my.
NEED. BLUEBERRI. FIZZ. NOW.
A side of Buffalo Chicken Dip would be an added bonus.
Wow.
I made the pizza loaf as an appetizer for a pot luck dinner this week and it was a HUGE hit.
PS – the Pringles Select Parmesan Garlic chips are very money too.
Fuck. Nobody is going to want to hear about my Totino’s frozen pizzas now. Thanks a lot.
Stolis! Have we met before?
This sounds absolutely delicious, but I must say that the Litehouse brand Bleu Cheese is not nearly Bleu Cheesey enough for my liking. It was basically mayo with a few chunks in it. They offer a double-the-cheese variety, but for the price you could go with Marie’s or Marzetti’s. The best option, though, is to just buy some fresh bleu cheese and make your own!
Anthony – Strangely enough, I don’t like Marie’s at all, and Marzetti’s is never carried around me.
I haven’t actually tried Marie’s, just ASS-U-ME it is better based entirely on popularity and price tag.
Like I said, the best option is to make your own when possible, as it is fairly easy and does not require any special skillz or hardware.
This post has inspired me to go post my Superbowl chili recipe on the old blog.
I want chili, now.
P.S. The buffalo dip was an excellent appetizer for my pre-golf warm-up. Helped me work through my slice.
I would suggest switching the shredded chicken for ground chicken… would probably make things a little easier all around.
Will – Good suggestion, but I prefer shredded chicken. (When I was a kid I got it in my head they didn’t grind up the good meat.)
Woo looks and sounds great – think I will try it too.
Thanks for showing me how.

I have been making the buffalo chicken dip for quite awhile and my family LOVES it!! To change things up every once in awhile, we like to get a premaid pizza dough and make buffalo chicken pizza. Lightly cover the pizza dough with ranch dressing, then layer the chicken dip on top and cover with cheese. So yummy!!
Instead of melting the cream cheese in the pan, I like to cut it into little squares, add it over the chicken like that, pour the warm ranch over top, and let it melt while it bakes. It makes it a little chunkier. Personal preference, but still really good!
Loooooovvvveeddd IIIIIITttttttt!!!!
Buff Chix sooo goood in tum tummmmm
Instead of shredded chicken you can use canned white meat chicken and it makes it a lot faster and easier to make! I work with Swansons and we use their white meat canned chicken. Also, you can take this to a tailgate if you make it beforehand and then put in a heavy disposable foil pan. You can re-heat on the grill so it’s nice and hot and bubbly!
HERE WE GO STEELERS…HERE WE GO….
I GOT A FEELING…PITTSBURGH’s GOING TO THE SUPER BOWL!
Luv this dip–my sister makes it. Hmm, maybe a SuperBowl appetizer. It can be lightened up with lighter cream cheese, dressing, and reduced fat cheese. In any case, my main comment was about the blueberry fizz. I invented a drink with blueberry vodka last summer that I call a Blueberry Twist, which is similar, but not quite the same. I have yet to meet a single person who doesn’t like it, and my official sampling has included quite a diverse range of people. In any case, to try a Blueberry Twist, use the amount of blueberry vodka of your liking with a diet citrus soft drink such as Sierra Mist, 7UP, etc. over ice, and garnished with a nice piece of lemon peel and a couple blueberries (no muddling). If you want to take it up a notch you could use frozen blueberries. Enjoy! And here’s to the Steelers Six Appeal! Here We Go!!!

Davad Bazan is my favorite vocalist from any band I’ve ever heard. There, I said it, and I’m not at all worried that I’ve painted myself into a corner. I’ve heard a lot, but his vocal range, distinct sound, and cut-to-the-core lyrics resonate deeper within me than anything I’ve heard thus far in my musical history. Having said this, I threw a mental party when I saw he would be playing Control from his Pedro the Lion days in its entirety at the Troubadour this month, but wasn’t even slightly surprised to see the show quickly sell out.
After the opening performance by sibling duo Stagnant Pools, Bazan and supporting tour members Andy Fits and Alex Westcoat took to the stage to do their own final sound check. The audience kept quiet in anticipation, but with the opening notes of “Options” (reflective of Control‘s opening track), each onlooker was right on point with head-nodding and silent lip-syncing. I have to give credit to the crowd — this was a true following of people who knew word-for-word every song performed.
I was curious to see how the performance would play out. I knew better than to think that Bazan would just play Control from start to finish, but I was elated to hear him move beyond Pedro the Lion songs. The band branched out with songs such as “Gas and Matches” from his project Headphones as well as tracks pulled from his solo material. From within Pedro the Lion’s catalog, Bazan wasn’t restricted to Control; “When They Really Get to Know You, They Will Run” from It’s Hard to Find a Friend elicited significant applause from the audience (as well as from myself).
Despite the fact that the venue was packed to the brim just for them, the band kept a refreshingly humble demeanor. They not only took the time to talk to the audience, but also honored and answered questions from the crowd. From his feelings about Spotify to his initial thought process behind Control, Bazan honored a forum-like open discussion between songs. With such an extensive history of consistently great music, we all listened to anything he had to say earnestly. There was no chatter between songs (again, credit to the crowd); there was simply patience and involvement, which led to a greater appreciation of the displayed talent.
The highlight of the performance was a tie between Pedro the Lion’s “Magazine,” with the percussion culminating with the chorus, and Bazan’s own “Eating Paper” from Strange Negotiations, which, despite my reservations, was equally beautiful without the keys present in the album recording. Though I did hope to hear “Wolves at the Door,” the performance was flawlessly executed, each song evoking the deepest human emotions and experiences, and with songs such as “Second Best,” provocative even.
“You know we don’t fuck with encores,” Bazan stated, and after the last song, the room quickly emptied into the even smaller merch area and sidewalk, with people seeking relief from the overly concentrated space. Overall, Bazan’s performance was as consistent as his last albums, his talent translates equally across recorded and live platforms, and my initial statement about him being my favorite vocalist remains true and unchallenged.

Salisbury zoning board allows horse boarding
BY JOHN FRIEL, Correspondent
Outside storage is out, but a Narvon farmer is free to board horses and rent indoor storage space.
At its meeting Jan. 22, the Salisbury Township Zoning Hearing Board heard from Amos T. Ebersol, 590 Red Hill Road, and some of his neighbors.
Ebersol requested two special exceptions to allow horse boarding in his barn and storage in two former agricultural buildings as well as a variance to allow outside storage.
Six neighbors requested, and received, party status in the case, using it to voice concerns about aesthetics and property values.
Greg Kimes, of Thistle Drive, said he was opposed to outside storage and "farm equipment rotting away. ... Horse boarding is not an issue."
Richard Johnson, also of Thistle Drive, said his house "by design looks directly at the farm." He objected to "anything that would turn my view into a negative."
Debbie Ryan, who lives across the street from Ebersol, told the board, "We all moved there for the aesthetics ... because we had this fabulous view." She said she does not wish to see "RVs, construction equipment, farm equipment. ... We didn't move there to see that."
Chairman Larry Martin asked her: "Do you know how this land is zoned?"
Ryan replied, "Agriculture."
Martin then inquired, "And what do they do in agricultural zones?''
"They farm," Ryan said.
Martin countered, "But you don't want to see farm equipment?"
All who testified agreed they had no objection to horses, but were concerned about the outside storage issue. Ebersol said he had proposed that as "an option," but mainly wants to rent the two outbuildings, which he said would be "really nice for a contractor."
Ebersol plans a "high-tensile, three- or four-strand" fence around 7 acres of pasture on his 21-acre farm to contain up to 14 horses. Johnson said the existing fence "needs work. We've had cows and horses in our backyard" when the farm was under different ownership.
The board denied the request for outdoor storage, but approved the rest of Ebersol's application. Farm buildings no longer used in agriculture can be rented, Zoning Officer Damian Clawser said.
The board set no limit on the number of horses, noting that Ebersol must erect a fence at least 4 feet high and 10 feet inside his property line in addition to following state nutrient management guidelines for manure disposal.
In the evening's other two cases, the board approved:
n A variance allowing Daniel B. Stoltzfus to exceed the maximum permissible impervious surface coverage at 942 Gap Road, Kinzers. Clawser said Stoltzfus' planned new house will cover 17 percent of his 17,424-square-foot lot. Township zoning allows only 7 percent coverage in the rural residential district, but Clawser said that ratio is intended for larger lots such as the 3-acre minimum now in force. Stoltzfus's tract predates zoning and is surrounded by R-1 residential zoning, which permits 30 percent coverage.
n A modification of a previous decision, allowing woodworker Levi K. Esh Jr. to employ up to six nonfamily employees at his kitchen cabinet and furniture business at 568 Hensel Road, Kinzers.
In other business, the board reorganized for 2013 with the same lineup as 2012's. Larry Martin will again serve as chairman, Peter Horvath as vice chair and John Wanner as secretary. Julie Miller was retained as the board's attorney.

WORLD
Israel signals launching airstrikes against Syria Research center also hit French airstrikes hit northern Mali 6 suspected bombers arrested Suicide bomber kills 36."
WASHINGTON -- The Israeli attack last week on a Syrian convoy of anti-aircraft weapons appears to have also hit the country's main research center for work on biological and chemical weapons, according to U.S. officials who are sorting through intelligence reports.
While the main target of the attack Wednesday appears to have been the weapons and their launchers -- which the Israelis feared were about to be moved to Hezbollah forces in Lebanon -- video shown on Syrian television appears to back up assertions that the research center north of Damascus was also damaged.
That complex, the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, has been the target of U.S. and Western sanctions for more than a decade because of intelligence suggesting that it was the training site for engineers who worked on chemical and biological weaponry.. He said 30 planes were used in the operation.
The French intervened in Mali on Jan. 11 to stem the advance of the al-Qaida-linked fighters.
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Afghan police on Sunday arrested six men and seized suicide vests, assault rifles and more than 50 hand grenades during a raid on a residential building in central Kabul, senior officials said.
BAGHDAD -- A suicide car bomber attacked a provincial police headquarters in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Sunday morning, the police and the city's civil defense director said, killing at least 36 people and wounding 105. Three additional suicide attackers who attempted to enter the general directorate of Kirkuk police after the blast were killed by the police.

Mandala Monday: Zentangle Dare 3
What a great time to discover the new Zendala Dares from The Bright Owl when I have set my own zendala a week challenge. This week I have two zendalas I have completed for the 2nd and 3rd dares. I can't believe how completely different they turned out and feel. The first is from dare 2 and was completed earlier in the week after work when I really needed some zen time. The dare 3 zendala I completed today and seems to have much more energy and even a sort of circus or carnival feel to it.

Challenge 67: Amanda Day
The Challenge from the Diva this week was to create a tile inspired by Earth Day or as it now known at the Diva's as Amanda Day. I thought what better to express the Earth than a string of "the Earth." So my string is based on a Western Hemisphere view. Once drawn, I realized how much water there is vs. land space on our lovely planet. The space to draw the continents was tiny and I wanted more than one represented, but you can definitely see that my waves are the predominant tangle on this tile. I tried to tie my tangles into the continents, not too sure how successful I was. North America is represented by Baton which reminded me of the stripes on our flag. Pais represents South America which is Spanish for country so I thought that might fit. Africa is Wellinstil which has little flames in it and since Africa seems hot to me I thought that worked. Then I was a little unsure for Europe and I thought of England and Aero candy bars so the bubbles are representing Europe. Greenland got some bubbles too. It was a fun and challenging challenge this week. Thanks Diva!
Mandala Monday
I am really enjoying the new Mandala tiles from Zentangle and have decided to complete one a week as I work my way through the 9 different pre-strung tiles. If you haven't tried them yet, you really should. The possibilities are endless!

New Tangle: Phansy
My April newsletter featured a contest to name my newest tangle. So congratulations to Kara Monroe for the naming this tangle Phansy. Kara said the tangle reminded her of her favorite flower the pansy and she also thought the tangle looked like a fan so she combined the two to come up with Phansy. Thanks to everyone who sent in your awesome suggestions. Kara won the painted stone below with the tangle Enyshou.

New Tangle: Koryl
This new to my blog tangle, is actually the first tangle I ever came up with. I haven't shared it with anyone except at my CZT training when we were all asked to go out and search for patterns and come up with our own tangle. When I received this challenge I wasn't sure what I was going to do. When I left the CZT training that night I actually had to go to work. It was a really ridiculous week for me. I was in the middle of working on three grant proposals for work and taking the CZT training at the same time. Lucky for me the CZT training is so inspiring and full of positive energy or I might not have made it through. Anyway, when I finally got home that night I spied my dish of sea glass and in it was this fossilized piece of coral that I had been wanting to do something with and it struck me - AH HA! This could be your new tangle. I had always loved looking at the intricate details of it and now was my chance to put it into my art. So here for you is my first tangle, Koryl.

This was a fun challenge. I really like the tangleations and possibilities of this tangle. Plus I just love trying new tangles. Looking around for new tangles in the world is one of my favorite things to do on walks around downtown Indy. The string for this tangle was actually inspired from a crest-like design I saw above a doorway on a walk this week. I never thought to look for string inspirations!

Their shit is awesome, maybe you know them from Tyler or Earl Sweatshirt if those names ring a bell. The American Flag shirt is from Joyrich, which is an amazing brand with lots of real awesome shit. I’ve had so many compliments on my shirt I can’t even remember, I’m glad they’re hard to get here in Belgium, wouldn’t miss my shirt for the world. Definitly a brand to check in with, chicks!

Cellphones More Important Than Kids?
Could it be that it’s easier to forget your child in the car than realize your cellphone is missing? A tragic number is telling.
At last count, 513 American kids have died inside hot, closed cars since record-keeping began in 1998. About half were forgotten by a parent or caregiver.
Because the death toll continues to climb, authorities met in Washington, D.C. this week to propose immediate action. “It’s so urgent that we find effective sets of countermeasures that we all can take right now,” said David Strickland of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as quoted in the Washington Post.
And what do experts suggest as a top countermeasure? Put your cellphone in the back seat with your child.
The unsettling message here: it’s gotten to the point that you might leave your child behind unnoticed, but you won’t go long without your phone.
The advocacy group Kids and Cars.org has a there-but-for-the-grace-of-God perspective. Says founder Janette Fennel: “People think these people must be terrible parents, they must be monsters, because if we think that, we can’t relate to them. Nothing could be further from the truth.”
The truth is that any of us can fall prey to a single act of absent-mindedness which could have horrific results. To avoid that, parents and caregivers must be mindful and informed.
Some life-saving advice from KidsandCars:
- Your child gets hot faster than you do – up to five times faster.
- A closed car can reach a broiling 125 degrees in only minutes.
- Cracking the windows does not slow the heating.
Practice safe habits:
- Don’t leave your child alone in a car, even for a minute.
- Look before you lock. Open the back door and check inside before you walk away.
- Instruct your babysitter or childcare center to call you if your child doesn’t show up when he or she is expected.
And, yes – lest you forget: when you buckle up your child, put your go-to things in the back seat, too – which will surely include a cellphone.

Imagine a half-drunken jam session between Mille Petrozza, Fenriz and Tom G. Warrior, the lot of them caught between ripping through varying combinations of their distinctive thrash, black and proto-black heaviness and just rocking out on Motorhead-meets-Venom sloppy rock.
Don’t act like that doesn’t sound like fun.
And it kind of is, and though it regrettably actually involves exactly none of the players I name-checked, The Seth Avalanche certainly sounds like the scene I just described.
At heart, this six-song EP is a thrash effort, but it’s one that runs headlong and happily into black metal, and it’s one that sports a noticeable rock influence, particularly in the jaunty bounce and greasy-grimy guitar licks of “Eating The Maneater” and album opener “Fuckslut From Hell.” “Blunt Force To The Head” starts on a slow, simple chug before stepping into some blastbeats and a full-out thrashing ending, and “Not Quite What I Had In Mind” reverses that, starting out blasting and dropping into a swinging mid-section that is guaranteed to get toes a-tappin’, touching on a killer sliding riff and moving past without further ado. On each of these tunes, vocalist Nils Meseke shrieks and growls like a demented Petrozza, his performance dramatic, borderline unhinged, as engagingly silly as it is spitting and aggressive.
While The Seth Avalanche is an entertaining endeavor based on quality thrashing blackness alone, it achieves a next-level ridiculous uber-metal-ness (and metallic uber-ridiculousness) by way of its lyrics, which are equal parts comical and disturbing and oddly endearing in their over-the-top attempts to shock. “Fuckslut From Hell” speaks for itself, and the title track lives up to its blackness – it’s the most stereotypically black metal lyric on hand, a sociopolitical middle-finger-raised take on the forthcoming end of the world: “Where’s your God now / at the dawn of the age of Seth?” “Eating The Maneater” begins with a verse about a man stalking, killing and eating a Bengal tiger – this man is clearly crazier and / or hungrier than I have ever been – but then it takes the titular character in a direction all Hall & Oates, juxtaposing the tiger against a woman in a bar, here both predator and prey. Hearing Meseke screech “Back home I’ve got a freezer full of women just like you / I’m eating the maneater!” is one of the EP’s most head-banging / head-shaking moments, and the couplet of “Cause when you spread you become my favorite dish / who’s wrapped around whose finger now as I go to the land of fish” is equally poetic. Still, the highest and lowest praise must go to “Not Quite What I Had In Mind,” which details in no uncertain terms the protagonist’s taunting of his enemies, who then beat him to a pulp, break his legs and teeth, tie him to a chair and brutally sodomize him repeatedly, which (you guessed it) was not what he had in mind.
As noted elsewhere in other reviews, black / thrash is quite the rage these days, with some great recent efforts by Aura Noir, Mongrel’s Cross, and the like. Septekh isn’t as sharp or as raging as those, not quite in that league of giants, but The Seth Avalanche still exhibits a winning combination of the vicious and the ludicrous, and it’s certainly skilled enough to make for an enjoyable burst of rocking blackness.

The "Another Late Night" moniker goes out with a flourish, as Kid Loco delivers a sparkling mix. Like all the great DJ's, Loco takes a bundle of songs which shouldn't go together in any shape or form and delivers a seamless mix. So many gems here: The Herbaliser's "The Hard Stuff", John Lydon's rant at "Religion" as part of P.I.L. Aim's "Fall Break" with that violin sample Tranquillity Bass's "Soldiers Sweetheart" over the top of Harvey Madel's "Wade In Water" and the piece de resistance - Flevans "Spooked" followed by Kid Loco's own ridiculously funky cover of "Paralysed" by Gang of Four. An essential purchase

Burbank middle school teacher who had sex with student sentenced to two years in prison

Pathetic.

If I was that student with this cutie, I never would've said a word when the cops came knockin'.
Maybe she was overcome with guilt. To each their own. Two years at Chowchilla is no duckwalk. She'll meet some female thugs at that facility. But the overriding worst part of the equation is having to register as a sex offender. That's lifetime and will follow her to all 50 states.

Something truly needs to be done with this epidemic of child molestation before parents turn to taking the law into their own hands seeking revenge on their prepetrators. Our laws seem ineffective so far.

Another slap on the wrist for a female sex offender. How much time do you think a male teacher would have gotten for "consentual" sex with a teen girl?
Posted by: greg | May 07, 2010 at 12:28 PM
How stupid. This new "morality" looks more like hypocrisy to the nth degree than justice. I'm sure that the boy doesn't feel a victim, it's the morality peddlers that make it so. Why if this boy decides to kill some one gets tried as an adult, but if he is looking to have sex with a beautiful girl, he can't say no. I'm sure she didn't put a gun to his head, so I don't see any problem by them having sex. Why, and it has happened, if a 13 year old girl and a 17 year old boy want to have sex in a school bus and the bus video camera records the act, the city attorney didn't do any thing, why here? It's stupid and immoral to punish some one for having sex, when at the same time nobody gives a hoot about the thousands and thousands of teenagers who sell their bodies every day and night in every major city. This is hypocrisy to the nth degree. A cop, in San Antonio, TX raped, supposedly, a 13 year old girl and he got probation. And to add salt to injury. Two guys were sent to jail for 17 and1/2 and 20 years and they only bought pictures of children. There is something rotten in this morality lynching judicial system. And why the other teacher in Florida, a beauty also, was sent of home confinement. Something stinks to high heaven. This might be an opinion from the court; this can't be justice. Justice is supposed to be blind. No peeking allow, but here lady justice raised the blindfold. That is not fair.

2 years is too lenient. If the genders were reversed, the male teacher would have been convicted of several crimes that would warrent decades of imprisonment. Somewhere in the back of your mind is the thought, Lucky kid got his boyhood dreams fufilled. Admit it.

She is a molester regardless of her appearance. If the molester was a great looking male teacher, I wonder if people would have the same opinion?
Posted by: boochie | May 07, 2010 at 01:05 PM
I wish I had a teacher that friendly when I went to school;) From a guy's point of view if the sex was consensual I don't see much wrong with it. With so many teenage kids having sex these days he would have a better chance avoiding early parenthood, disease and/or jealousy issues with this lady than most teenagers do. There are a lot worse "crimes" that get shorter sentences.

It should have been 14 years.
Posted by: Bluejeans | May 07, 2010 at 01:08 PM
Once again it becomes painfully clear that the law treats women like children in American society. While it may be true that, "Two years at Chowchilla is no duckwalk", had she been a man accused of having sex with a 14 year old female, the sentence would have been much harsher. Additionally, had the perpetrator been a man, the charges would have most certainly included rape. A charge not filed against Ms. Beck.
Sex with a minor is the same weather it be a male or female and should be prosecuted fairly, without regard for the sex of victim or predator. Women will never be totally free in this country until they are treated equally under the law, for better or worse.
Posted by: Rafael Noble | May 07, 2010 at 01:12 PM
Makes no difference is the teacher is a "cutie" or butt ugly. She is the adult in this situation and therefore should suffer the consequences of her actions. I hope she likes her new roommates.
Posted by: Cara D | May 07, 2010 at 01:17 PM
The thing, i am mad about is if this is a "Man" having consent sex with a girl student, he will be sentence to jail for 15 years and because she is a women she got only TWO. I hate this sex discrimination.
Posted by: hvinh99 | May 07, 2010 at 01:33 PM
Emile Zola you obviously don't get it. Teachers are licensed by the state and have a responsibility and are an adult authority figure. What hope is there for our schools if teachers ( male or female) take advantage of this position to prey on their under age students ? Yes, there is plenty of hypocrisy in our society over sex, but this does not make what this woman did right. For all of you that can't see the young boy as a victim and think" how cool to have your teacher do this", then I challenge you to imagine the student as a female and the teacher a male.
Or better yet the student your daughter. If your opinion changes then there's some hypocrisy..!!

Burbank teacher did not and could not simply and solely have "sex" with a "student" under the criminal statutes of our laws.
She did and is convicted of having deliberately prey upon and feloniously RAPE a child.
For that she justly received two years in jail.
And after she is released from jail she, for the rest of her life, will be known and professionally referred to as a sexual predator of children. Never again to be trusted around any child in a professional setting. Ever.
Not just a sexual act. A felony one. A predatory one. A cruel and abhorrent VIOLATION of a child.
Posted by: Lorraine | May 07, 2010 at 02:17 PM
hmmm - If that same 14 year old student would have killed the 33 year old teacher how much do you want to bet that the DA would have charged the 14 year old as a adult? So they are old enough to be charged as a adult in a crime but not old enough to consent to have sex. The age of consent should be the same age that you can be charged as a adult for criminal activity. The DA likes to have it both ways.
Posted by: Greg | May 07, 2010 at 02:39 PM
There was nothing wrong with what she did. Morale police are just too much in America.
Just because someone is under 18 does not mean they are a child. Circumstances need to be taken into account rather than using numbers to justify such persecution.
Oh, if it was a male and they were much more famous than the lady here., nothing would have happened.
Look up Roger Clemens and his friendship with a 16 year old.
Posted by: la rider | May 07, 2010 at 02:40 PM
two years sounds extreme to me. no priors? slap on the wrist is more appropriate. age of consent last century in Cali was 14. and 30 years ago it was 14 in Connecticut and many other states.

Inter-species illness: What's special about swine flu?
Swine flu is everywhere, or at least in the media, at the moment. All of the buzz has us wondering -- how are viruses passed from animals to people? It turns out that pigs play a unique role in the whole exchange.
The avian flu has been worrisome for those who fear a pandemic, particularly since 2004, when the World Health Organization began confirming cases of it in people. But unlike its avian counterpart, swine flu appears to be spreading easily from human to human.
This could be because human anatomy is more similar to pig anatomy than to bird anatomy. Science classes often dissect fetal pigs in order to understand the human body. Pigs are large mammals, and thus it's possible for them to spread the illness to other large mammals, including humans.
But why have pigs passed the virus to people, and not to other mammals (like dogs and cats)? And why don't we catch the flu from our pets? They are, after all, the mammals we deal with on a daily basis. But there is no evidence that dog flu has ever spread to other species, according to Wikipedia.
The answer goes back to the bird flu. This strain is especially deadly in humans. When it is transmitted to pigs, it can mutate to form a virus that adapts more easily to people. In other words, the pigs act as incubators for new forms of the virus that can infect people.
The origin of the current outbreak is not known, but it's possible that migratory birds infected Mexican factory farm pigs, who then infected farm workers. Or the pigs could have become infected through manure and flies carrying the virus. A crowded farm or slaughterhouse probably doesn't have much in common with your backyard doghouse.

Google censored videos offending Thai king, denied other requests
Google stopped more than 300 YouTube videos from being viewed in Thailand last year, hewing to a deeply controversial law that forbids Thais from insulting their king.
The century-old lèse majesté law, championed by backers as a way to uphold the dignity of the king, has been increasingly criticized as a swipe at free speech that makes it easier to jail government opponents.
Thai officials asked Google to remove 374 videos last year, saying they violated the disputed law, the California company revealed in its most recent Transparency Report. To follow the law within Thailand, Google agreed to restrict Thais from viewing most of the targeted videos.
It was one in a growing list of requests from governments around the world that the powerful search engine company heeded. Operating a search engine that scours the globe, Google must contend with a thicket of local laws and court orders, weighing thousands of requests to erase or restrict search results.
It releases information about what it has been asked to remove and why twice a year, a sometimes surprising chronicle of what governments and companies worldwide want to scrub from the Internet.
Google canceled five accounts on YouTube that British authorities argued promoted terrorism, saying they violated its own company guidelines. It restricted some videos in Germany that the country said violated a law meant to protect children. And it also stopped Turkish Web surfers from seeing seven videos that allegedly violated laws against insulting Turkish founder Kemal Ataturk.
But Google said it brushed off other government requests, many aimed at quashing political criticism. "It’s alarming not only because free expression is at risk, but because some of these requests come from countries you might not suspect — Western democracies not typically associated with censorship," company senior policy analyst Dorothy Chou wrote on the Google blog.
Last year, Google refused to remove videos that satirized the Pakistani army, recorded police brutality in the United States, and poked fun at the lifestyle of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. It turned down a Canadian government request to remove a video of a Canadian urinating on his passport and flushing it down the toilet.
Spain unsuccessfully pushed for Google to remove search results linked to public figures such as mayors and public prosecutors, the company said. Google also scuttled a Polish Agency for Enterprise Development request to block some search results that criticized the agency.
The balancing act that Google seeks to strike is evident in India, where the company stopped Web surfers from viewing some videos in areas where local laws banned speech that could stir up “enmity between communities,” but left them viewable elsewhere in the world. It also rejected a request to remove online profiles that criticized a local politician, saying they didn't violate any laws.
The demands on Google have only grown: In India, requests to block content surged nearly 50% in the second half of the year. The upswing is even more dramatic in the U.S., where removal requests have more than doubled in the last six months, many of them tied to alleged defamation and harassment. All in all, Google says removal requests jumped by roughly a quarter worldwide in the second half of 2011.

Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott List Their Malibu HomeAuthor: KePlay // Category: Real Estate
Actors Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott have listed their Malibu, Calif., home for $2.7 million.
The couple purchased the home in September 2011 for $2.4 million, according to public records. The home is on 1.8 acres in the Point Dume section of Malibu, and includes access to a private, gated beach. The 2,400-square-foot home has three bedrooms and 2½ bathrooms. Before moving in, Ms. Spelling and Mr. Dean made roughly $100,000 worth of upgrades, including adding organic gardens, a chicken coop, new kitchen appliances and 100-year-old French oak wood floors. They also built a miniature horse corral. The property has views of the canyon below, and also includes a one-bedroom mobile home on site that can be used as staff quarters.
The couple, along with their children, star in their own reality show, “Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood.” Listing broker Madison Hildebrand of Coldwell Banker Previews International in Malibu says the couple decided to sell because they recently found out Ms. Spelling is expecting a fourth child and the home is too small. “They moved in with every intention of staying,” says Mr. Hildebrand.
Photos: Private Properties
Ms. Spelling rose to fame in the early 1990s for her role as Donna Martin on the TV series “Beverly Hills, 90210,” and is the daughter of the late television producer Aaron Spelling and his widow, Candy. Last summer Candy Spelling sold the 57,000-square-foot mansion in which the younger Ms. Spelling was raised for $85 million.
Colorado Ranch Goes on the Market Asking $23.9 Million
Western Disposal Services owner Dan Souders and his wife put their 1,271-acre ranch in northwestern Colorado on the market for $23.9 million.
Bordered by the Elk River, the property includes a 5-acre private lake and a stream for sight fishing. Located about 12 miles north of Steamboat Springs, the ranch also includes a 7,575-square-foot main house as well as seven other residences. There’s also an indoor equestrian center, outdoor riding rings, a horse barn and a cattle barn.
Mr. Souders, 68, and his wife bought the property about 16 years ago for $10 million. They put part of the ranch on the market in the past but have now decided to sell it in its entirety. “We’d like to spend time some place a little warmer,” says Mr. Souders. Jeffrey Buerger of Hall & Hall has the listing.
Brook Byers’s San Francisco Home Sells for $10 Million
Brook Byers and his wife, Shawn, have sold their San Francisco home for $10 million to Andrew Spokes, a principal and senior managing member at Farallon Capital Management, a San Francisco hedge fund.
Mr. Byers, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, bought the Presidio Heights home in 1985 for $1.5 million. He and his wife began quietly shopping the home last year for $15 million, but dropped the price by 20% in December.
The 9,300-square-foot Georgian-style home dates back to 1910, when it was designed as a wedding gift to a daughter of the Coors beer family. With eight bedrooms, it also has a master suite with views of the Golden Gate Bridge.
Lisa Wolfe and Susan McBride of TRI Coldwell Banker represented Mr. Byers in the sale.

Dear Sue,
I really want to thank you again for agreeing to attend Higher Ground’s annual retreat and introduce our members to Laughter Yoga. When you first came to the retreat and saw that the group was all guys, you were really scared that it wasn’t going to be a good session because men just don’t let loose and enjoy. What turned out to be a hesitant moment on your part, turned out to be one of the best moments for all of us.
I met Sue in New York sometime near the beginning of this century at a three-day training course. She was very noticeable - tall, elegant, and sophisticated - she radiated a powerful, positive force.Completion of this course included a listing in an online directory…Sue and I were obviously connected, because our bios were switched! For a short while I was credited with a lot more knowledge and experience than I actually have, and all I could say about my temporary alter ego was WOW! I am sure Sue was surprised to be listed as a former exotic dancer!It was exciting to have so many qualifications, even though the mix-up was short-lived. We really bonded the following year in Seattle at another course and once I figured out that there was more than one Birmingham in the States, I visited Sue in Michigan from Toronto. On one of those excursions, I attended her Laughter Yoga course and that practice has been a delightful and enriching boon to my skill set.Sue is an inspiration, a great and generous friend, a consummate life student and devoted educator. Her humour and life experience make her a wonderful compassionate leader.Lots of Love and Che-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-heers!RosemaryToronto, Ontario, Canada
Simply put, my most vivid, cherished and regular recollection of you, Sweet Sue, is your “holy trinity” - your smile, our laughter and your spirit! That’s the memory that’s stuck with me of the person I met on the first night of our Laughter Yoga training. That’s the person I have come to know and love. I don’t think I have ever told you this, but sometimes when I feel like succumbing to some daily trial or tribulation, my CLYT pops into my head with a hearty “ho-ho-ha-ha-ha” and makes me forget my troubles long enough to keep on keepin’ on!Love, SheilaEugene, Oregon

As Daerundros rests her mind while the Company of Five was still dwelling by Delossad, she falls into a dream which could perhaps forebode a confrontation between her and Vardarianna.
"Shall we commence?" I asked, unsheathing my sword as Minyelaírë took her scimitar from her hilt and did the same, taking that as a yes.
Sorrow. Woe and Sorrow. I did not know how to respond once I heard the news that Vardarianna had been captured."WHAT?!" I yelled, my voice carrying over the passages of Tâl Bruinen, I shook my head in anger, "B-but how?!"Minyelaire did not respond, instead staring at me, intently yet...-

We’re just coming out of a week long cold snap where our temps dipped down to 0° c. at night and right around 10°c. during the day. This is a bit too cold for the bees and so they haven’t been out much which is a shame because we currently have several fields in our area filled with bright yellow canola plant blossoms, the bees love it and it gives them a large part of their spring honey supply. Today our temps are back up and the bees are zipping around like crazy.
Here is a picture of the hives with their additional honey boxes.
Currently there are 4 boxes to each hive, boxes are added as needed for honey storage. In the bottom two boxes the queen lays her eggs and all the new bees are born there. So unless you want bee larvae mixed in with your honey, you have to keep the queen out of the honey storage boxes, you can see in the picture a thin board right in the middle which I’ve marked as “queen excluder”. You place that thin board, which is actually a metal screen, on top of the brood box (where the babies are). The worker bees can pass through the slots in the screen but they are just a bit too narrow for the queen to fit through, so she can’t go up into the top boxes.
My husband has been making good progress with the garbage removal, he’s got the first dumpster filled and we will get another one on Monday which is only for wood. There was heaps of stacked wood left to rot behind the house, we’re not allowed to burn it ourselves so have to pay to have it hauled away.
This mixed material dumpster will end up costing around 500 euro… getting rid of garbage around here is not cheap! The wood container should be a bit cheaper since it only contains one thing.
I haven’t been able to do much around the garden since the weather turned cold so I’m just dreaming about what to plant where :O)
Next year I will plant a large herb garden, but for this year I’m only growing a few things on our bridge, just the stuff we use the most, like parsley, thyme, chives and later I’ll plant some basil.
This is flat leaf parsley that I planted a few days ago.
And here are some plants that I ordered from an online shop. They arrived packed in hay and looking a bit rough but they’ve popped back into shape nicely. I want to use as many native plants as I can, and also insect friendly plants, I’ll probably end up with a yard full of plants that many people would consider weeds, but those are of course the ones that are most attractive to wildlife.
Here I’ve got some lady’s mantle, two types of comfrey, black-eyed Susans, and some hardy “Munstead” lavender.
And these are my catmint babies. Hopefully the cats will give them time to grow before rolling around in them ;O)
How far away are the bees from the house? I want to start raising bees, but I’m unsure of where to set the hives so they are safe yet the house and the horses are safe too.
Hi Monique,
our hives are about 20 yards from the house, mostly the distance is for their sake, so that they have a nice quiet area of the yard to themselves. The bees are really harmless unless you get too close the the front of their hives, then they might feel threatened and the guard bees might sting or chase you off.
Really though they are very passive creatures, we might get 3-4 stings in a year and that is usually when we are working directly in the hive or when mowing too close to the hive, they don’t like loud machines like lawn mowers or weed-whippers, so we usually cut around their area either late in the evening when they are done flying for the night, or we use hand tools to do the cutting. It’s not a problem to mow in the rest of the yard.
They shouldn’t bother the horses either as long as the horses are not right in front of the hive.
Keeping the hives in a quiet area where you will not be walking all the time is a good idea. also some place where they will not be completely in heavy shade is good. They need to get some sun to help warm up the hive. Our bees are on the south side of our house.
I would encourage you to give it a try. Look for a class in your area, or contact a local beekeeper and ask questions about getting started. It’s not hard and you’ll be doing alot of good for your area.

How to claim for asbestos compensation
Getting to know that your close one is struck with an asbestos related disease is not at all pleasing and hard to take. However the least you can do is seek compensation for your losses. You can always look for monetary compensation if your closed one has passed away suffering from an asbestos related disease. The money at least can repay the huge medical bills, disability, psychiatric help if needed for mental turmoil, lost wages and many other such damages.
Just follow some simple steps to retrieve an asbestos compensation. You can file for an asbestos compensation only if you or a family member have already been treated or suffered from an asbestos related illness like asbestosis or mesothelioma. Diagnosis can only happen by visiting the doctor and having a proper physical evaluation done. The doctor will examine your past records to check for any asbestos related illnesses and carry forward the usual x-rays, CT scans, MRI, biopsy, lung testing capacity etc. A biopsy is a must and very important element to treat mesothelioma. When you are filing for the asbestos compensation you clearly need to establish your states “statue of limitations”. This law is important as it sets a limit on the required amount of time the person needs to claim asbestos litigation. Some of the laws only mentions few years to claim where as many give more time. But if you realize you have crossed your states limit do not be disappointed, just consult a good and experienced mesothelioma attorney for guidance.

Santa Clara Law's Professor Chien Receives Grant to Expand Research on Startups and Trolls
February 05, 2013 at 2:38 PM.
"Startups drive innovation and new hires in our economy, so it's crucial to understand how the patent system affects them," Professor Chien said. "Although patents garner a lot of attention, not enough attention has been paid to the impacts on startups. My initial work suggests that small companies are more fragile and less able to handle patent demands without significant repercussions," she continued.
Her initial survey findings on startups and patents were covered by Forbes, TechCrunch (here and here), Reuters, the Silicon Valley Business Journal and other outlets, and the subject of testimony before the FTC and DOJ.
"The Silicon Valley is the world's leading birthplace of startup companies, and to maintain that leadership role--and the associated new jobs and economic activity--we must ensure that the patent system fosters, and doesn't suppress, entrepreneurial activity," said Professor Eric Goldman, director of Santa Clara Law's High Tech Law Institute. "Prof. Chien's work is helping us understand the complex interactions between startups and patents, and the research grant she received will help provide us with even more insight on these important questions."

I think I finally realize why Greg likes me: I'm from before 1980. Okay, his love of old things doesn't really carry over into the subject of humans. Okay again, it's mostly just movies, TV shows, music and comic books. But maybe just knowing that I was around when many of those things came to be carries some weight with him...
I've never made a big secret of the fact that I generally prefer shallow movies to deep. Well, I suppose I mean that I prefer comedy to drama. Oh, it's okay if they want to throw a message in there (as long as it's one I agree with and it's not done in a in-my-face or cheesy way--Hollywood isn't generally where I like to turn for morals/guidance); but mostly, just make me laugh, please. Greg likes comedies as well and is even willing to watch the romantic variety with me now and again. He also really likes science fiction, and I'm willing to watch those with HIM now and again (especially if they're sci-fi comedies).
But mostly, Greg likes old movies. When we first moved to Poland it seemed like every week there was ANOTHER of Greg's favorite TV series from the old days re-running. There are countless mini-series, and regular series from the 60's and 70's (I sure lost count a long time ago), most of them in black and white, that he has watched and fallen in love with again (about Polish/German spies during WWII, two boys who travel around Poland alone during the summer, a guy who is a driver and an awesome man and has interesting adventures, a man who has a car that turns into a boat and takes some kids treasure hunting, where they learn cool stuff about history, and at least a few just about families). He has since bought many (just counted-7) of them on DVD or VCD. He watches them over and over. He has taught our kids to love them (those geared to younger audiences) despite the fact that they are 1) black and white 2) slow moving 3) not interesting (or maybe just not shallow or funny?) enough for their mother to sit through an entire episode. I really love this about Greg.
He recently found a whole slew of Polish semi-musical comedies from the 60's that you can get cheap on DVD, and bought them. We've been watching them and they are mostly fun and a little silly.
If a movie, Polish or American, comes on TV and it looks like it was made before 1985 (but the best are 60's and 70's), I can guarantee he will want to at least "give it a try." When he says this, I know he means "watch from beginning to end, barring too much foul language or nudity, and regardless of the level of stupidity or poorness of acting." In this way we have discovered many, many strange, interesting and sometimes awesome movies. We've also discovered a lot of very dumb, pointless ones. When I think they're too dumb (or I'm just not in the mood) I don't watch them, but Greg still likes to watch, for the same reason he likes to watch the good ones. They take him to another time and place, when life was simpler, problems were more easily solved and people wore astonishing clothing.
I don't know if it's like this in America, but here, at 9:00pm Cartoon Network turns into TCM (Turner Classic Movies) and this is where we see the majority of those old movies (the American ones, anyway). On this channel we have seen North by Northwest 59 times, Coma once, and then avoided it like the plague ever after, and lots of others I can't think of to name (great memory, eh?) Oh, but I do remember that I finally got to see the ever famous Breakfast at Tiffany's on this channel.
Speaking of which, are any of you Breakfast at Tiffany's fans? From what I gather, all of you should be. If you are, please explain to me why I'm supposed to love that movie. I feel very backward about it. It definitely would have fallen into the previously mentioned category of "too dumb" (not in the sense of intelligence so much as the weak acting, awkward pace/story line etc.)for me to watch all the way through, but I decided to "give it a try" Greg style. After all, it's Breakfast at Tiffany's! I thought. I'm baffled. And if it's about Audrey Hepburn? Give me My Fair Lady ANY day. (But don't be offended by my review! Convert me!)
7 comments:
I suppose it is much better to be addictd to old tv rather than today's crud. And that explains all those shows you guys are watching when I call!
I don't remember "Breakfast at Tiffany's" being anything special, but I do like the song "moon River". I love the nostalgia of the shows I grew up watching. It always seems like the current ones are so dumb in comparison, but maybe if I went back and watched the ones I saw as a kid they wouldn't really be that great.
Nathan had me watch a documentary about musicals behind the iron curtain. Some of them were propaganda (songs about the joy of working in the field) and some were very funny. It was an interesting subject.
Sorry, I can't help you with Breakfast at Tiffany's. I watched most of it that one time that I went to Portland with Greg and that other girl. The family I was staying with didn't feel comfortable with me and their son alone watching a movie (which is so astoundingly funny, since we didn't even hold hands) but I just couldn't get into the movie. I had expected to love it, but it was pretty pointless. So I'm with you on that one.
Hurray! Other people who don't "get" that movie! I agree. Confusion. I don't even really buy Hepburn's character, and why does she even spend time with that guy? Yes, the song is good (my dad used to sing me to sleep with it), but even that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, as far as the placement in the movie.
(Behind the scenes scoop: Hepburn really wanted to sing the song herself, despite people advising her against it. She ended up singing it, but it's not so hot. Maybe why it's not her singing on My Fair Lady...?)
I also don't like "Love Story." Have you seen it? Another "classic." One of the big lines is, "Loving someone means never having to say you're sorry." (or something like that.) But no, in my opinion, loving someone, means you SAY you're sorry when you do something lame, or whatever, because you never, never want them to hurt them and would go out of your way not to and you couldn't live with yourself if you DIDN'T. ESPECIALLY in the bizarro circumstance that that line falls in the movie. And the other person shouldn't forgive you unconditionally if you don't show them the respect that they deserve...
Wow. I guess I really cared about that. Don't even get me started on "The Graduate..."
Andrea- I haven't seen either of the other movies you mention (see? I'm BACKWARD)
That's great! I knew there was a reason I have a hard time apologizing to Greg sometimes! It's because I LOVE him! SO much! Therefore, I naturally feel that I don't need to... I guess the idea is that you know each other so well and love so unconditionally that you automatically forgive each other? It sounds to me like someone was unhappy with how low the divorce rate was and came up with this phrase to remedy the situation. It reminds me of one of the quotes you have on your blog about how love doesn't "die a natural death". I love that quote because that idea is ridiculous (same with"we just grew apart" or "we fell out of love" and a load of other "reasons" people divorce). It's like saying the neglected flower died a "natural" death.
man, I've started this reply 2X already, let's try again:
About Breakfast at Tiffany's: I made the same mistake that you made. I rented the movie cuz I'd heard of it, and my impression was that people said they "kind of liked it". Then I watched it and thought it definitely wasn't all that, though I don't think I really hated it, just nothing to like, so why all the hype? Then I realized that I didn't actually KNOW a single person who'd recommended it, I was actually only going off of the song I like by Deep Blue Something ('s_(song))
think about it, is that possibly your mistake? I think it's kind of funny.
As for all the other old movies, I went through that phase a couple years ago when we did Blockbuster online. I must say I was soooo surprised at things that I'd heard of forever (like All's Quiet on the Western Front) that were just too tedious to be born! A few were pleasant surprises, like An Affair to Remember, and Gone with the Wind (not QUITE the same category, but still old) and I remember loving Arsenic and Old Lace. But I agree with you in general about the oldies not being so great, and I can't sit through an entire one that I clearly hate. But I have a sympathetic bone with Greg in the desire to experience them, and especially, to find the gems.
Breakfast @ Tiffany's: You're right -- not a great plot. I'm not a big fan of Truman Capote anyway. I think part of the reason it's a "classic" are the highly stylized sets and costumes, and of course, the theme song. The Japanese character played by Mickey Rooney is really offensive... Roman Holiday is a much better flick. You might like it...

Photo Gallery | Clarkston Chicken Lays Egg With A Secret
Keri Wilson has seen a lot of weird things on her family’s farm Wilson Banner Ranch near Clarkston, but this is one incident she’ll never forget. While collecting her chicken’s eggs yesterday, they found a surprise - a rather large egg.
It was bigger than their duck’s egg and bigger than the peacocks. It was 7 inches around one way and 8 inches and 3/16th the other way.
“I called my parents to come down to the house. With an egg that big, the chicken can damage their insides. It’s the equivalent to giving birth to a basketball,” Wilson said over the phone with a cringe. After a quick inspection, Wilson said all the girls were in good health.
Wilson and her husband inspected the egg last night, cracking it open into a pan.
“What was in there?” Wilson asked as she pondered the strange behavior of her chickens that she described them as just little dinosaurs and not the lovely little creatures they have at the fair.
Much like a Russian nesting doll, they found an egg inside of an egg. The inner egg was partially formed, a soft shell with a standard yolk. Wilson says the inner egg probably wasn’t laid the other day and the outer egg formed around it.
“I’ve never seen an egg in an egg. Clearly from what I can tell, one of the girls probably was too busy to get back in and lay,” Wilson said. “They continue to surprise me and do odd things.”
“They’re roaming around right now, always up to antics. I think all windows should lead to where you can see chickens do stupid things,” Wilson quipped.
Because these chickens are truly free-range, all sorts of things can get into their diet. Wilson said one of her chickens caught a mouse and ate it just the other day. The feisty “Jungle Fowl” also chase the farm cats around. She says they’re tough.
What happened to the egg within an egg? The inner egg went to Stella, the Saint Bernard, who is currently recuperating from an altercation with a raccoon. Apparently it’s a tough life on the Wilson Banner Ranch.

‘Sexting’ among teens addressed at public forumPublished 9:39pm Thursday, August 11, 2011
Think the situation involving five area high school students charged with sexting-related offenses in May was an isolated incident?
Think again, says Berrien County Prosecutor Art Cotter.
“If you think you don’t know (a teen) who has done this (sexting), you’re deluding yourself,” Cotter said at a community forum held Thursday at the Niles City Council Chambers. “It’s common, probably as common as underage drinking.”
The forum, organized by city council representatives Georgia Boggs and Pat Gallagher and dubbed “Saving Our Future,” indeed addressed the need for parents to monitor their children’s cell phone and online activity. But it was also about teaching parents and community members how to guide young people in the right direction in all aspects of life.
Gallagher said the purpose of the forum was to give people “a greater awareness of the laws” and to teach parents how to “inform and protect” their children.
Pastor Dan Miller of First Missionary Church in Niles said the prevalence of broken families today has made it more difficult on children and said the churches in the community need to be a “point of light” for area youth to turn to.
School teachers and administrators also play a role.
Both Richard Weigel, superintendent of Niles Community Schools, and John Jarpe, superintendent of Brandywine Community Schools, said there is little school administration can do about what children do outside of the classroom.
“But we can give guidance and advice,” Jarpe said.
Weigel said some of that guidance needs to be in the area of technology.
“They’re a tool, not a toy,” he said, regarding cell phones. “We want to teach them to use them as a communication and learning tool.”
The New Tech Entrepreneurial Academy that will launch this year at Niles High School will encourage having cell phones in the classroom as an avenue for learning, Weigel said.
Thursday’s forum took place in light of five Niles teenagers recently being accused of extracting sexual favors from a teenage girl for keeping recorded sex videos of her off the Internet.
Niles police officer Kevin Kosten presented Michigan laws on sexting and the dangers of posting explicit images online at the forum. Several community members expressed shock to find out that a teenager taking a nude or sexually explicit photo qualifies as producing child sexually abusive material, a 20-year felony under Michigan law.
Kosten referenced a 2008 study that revealed 40 percent of teenagers have sexted.
“Today those numbers are probably higher,” he said.
Kosten encouraged parents to be educated about laws involving technology, keep current on the technology, monitor their children’s cell phones and computers and keep the home computer in an open area of the house.
He also advised parents to make sure their children do not post explicit images on the Internet.
“The digital footprint will live on forever,” he said.
The forum also included a time for questions and answers with community leaders.
Boggs hopes the forum will spark a community movement to encourage and train local youth.
“Each of us has to take an active role in the future,” she said. “It’s about ‘what can I do?’ If we all sit on this, nothing will change.”
Did they also teach kids not to extort their classmates to have sex with a group of guys?
I am having a hard time understanding why this is becoming the topic of discussion. Those men did have pictures from “sexting” but those were only discovered in the process of investigating more serious crimes. Those men are not facing life in prison because of sexting. They are facing life in prison for extortion and rape. The sexting charges are small potatoes compared to the multiple life sentences they face.
I sincerely hope people aren’t buying into this blame the technology and hide behind buzz words like sexting to excuse these men’s actions. The least of those guys worries are charges from sexting. Let’s talk about rape and where the attitude comes from that men can bully around females, a very common occurrence in a town like Niles. Let’s teach females about self respect and to break their dependence on abusive and manipulative men to feel good about themselves. Let’s teach women to not feel ashamed to report crimes to the police when necessary. Telling kids that sexting is bad does not even begin to address the larger issues here.

The Two Sides Of Monsieur Valentine
My life is now complete.My life is now complete.
I did a little modification to the ole Think Tank, I changed the background a little with something I made in Photoshop and I modified some shapes, sizes and corners. I can't keep it looking one way because I like messing around with the code and seeing what I can do and what I can improve. I want to keep a stable look but change is too tempting.
Anyway as I was saying, my life is now complete. I got my album today, four months before its release. I finaly nabbed my very very much anicipated 5th long player from Austins own Spoon. Its a big deal to me because I've been on a mission trying to locate this with different tactics and scams with no avail but today I just used google and few choice search terms and commands and bam! I love you internet. I got to say though, I'm not sold on the production, they should of put Vanderslice up to it. Some of the demos fared better. I'd rank it their 3rd or 4th best which is far from bad. I remember that sad sad day when I was driving through Plano at 3am after a couple glasses of wine and put Spoons 1st best in the cd player and it broke as I was putting it in. The day the music died. I was going to write letter to Merge records but I wimped out. Maybe I still can.

ROTFFL......
Yes because everyone should NOT have a fair shot at the American dream here. Everyone shoud have oppurtunity? Outrageous. So evil.
metoo,
what excuse did REAGAN use when HE RAISED TAXES 11 TIMES?
i'm waiting....
Settle in. It's going to be a while.
11:10am and still no answer.

Prsident Obama's 4 years in office has been the biggest contradiction I've ever seen. And by the way, tastes nothing like StarBurst candy.
Poor davey still drowning no matter how hard he clutches his straws.
Mitt's Dad took welfare? Was on relief?....Good for him.....it gave him an oppertunity to be somebody. Otherwise his dad, and maybe even mitt would have been dead from starvation......Isn't it strange how soon we can forget when we are doing better.......I also like the way she says give him a chance!
Mitts Mom speaks......
Mom Fauxstew is just reminding us the of the timeless American value that everyone is NOT to have a shot at success in the United States. How can one not be behind that idea......no fair shot for anyone
FIRST READ: In rest of '98 clip, Obama speaks of 'competition' and 'the marketplace'
Sure he should apologize, but he won't. Don't you know that apologizing is a sign of weakness? He's too much of a tough guy to do that. What a douchebag.
The ideas spoken to the $50,000 a plate dinner was typical for Gov Mitt Romney and his pandering to the room he is in. As a centrist Republican married to a moderate Democrat we both discussed the leaks from Romney and the ones from Senator Obama in 1998, we felt that the comment from 1998 was not disenfranchising nor isolating a large segment of the population, whereas Romney's seemed to deliberately excise a portion of the population. While we realize this is due to the room he was talking to and their ideas that they pay more than their share, such speech does not show a presidential candidate aimed at united all Americans. There is too much movement depending on the room for Romney to be able to feel a sense of trust. We may not always like everything about Obama, but he is consistent and true to what he runs on. Given that we have both decided to cast a unified vote for Obama, Even given that, we believe Romney owes America an apology.
Romney didn't punt with his most recent comments, he fumbled inside the opposing teams Red Zone.
Considering voting Republican 'cuz Romney's a businessman? Consider this: You can't run the country like a buisness. A business is not a democracy!
Cindy - I would rather have the country run by a businessman than a 'Community Organizer'. What the hell is that anyway? Organize the community to protest for more goverment handouts!
Romney/Ryan 2012
Of course you would because you are rather clueless that there were only 2 businessmen elected president, the first created the great depression of the 1930's and the second created the great recession of 2008. So go pretend that you know more then what American stinker puts into your mouth back at free republic.
Considering voting Republican 'cuz Romney is a businessman? Consider this: You can't run a country like a business. A business is not a democracy.
I think the protests, violence, and murders in the Middle East are a prime example of why the US should not be involved in solutions to the problems in the region. It is obvious US influences of the past have led us to where we are today. Romney is right in my opinion, let nature take its course. Perhaps in time the problems will be resolved by the primary parties.
Hey that is a great speech by Obama, and even then he believed there were kind ways to work out differences, so that every body has a shot at life, and know one will be just put out on the streets. He says he doesn't know what to do about it at that point, but he believes that we can give everyone some quality of life if we can manage to find a way to make it happen. So what is wrong with saying that. He wasn't trying to create a division like willard ripoff does.
HatefulMom - you are obviously part of the handout crowd which is the reason you adore Obama and believe all his lies!
free republic sully you are as well I have yet to see a tea bagged republican who didn't have his hand out while whining that he was entitled to more.
Your candidate is Pinocchio and he would not know the truth if it came up and bit him on his only claim to manhood. In addition, he running mate is Lying Ryan he even lies about his Marathon time. The 47% are not the "handout crowd", they are:, ccharitable.
Does your contempt apply to those Corporations who do not pay Federal Income Tax? How about to your zero - oh I mean your hero- he uses tax loopholes to avoid paying taxes and what about those Swiss Accounts and Cayman Island accounts again to avoid paying taxes.
Reason to see Complete Returns for more than 2 years on Romney/Ryan:
1..” Marriott had to pay huge penalties and I wonder have similar methods been used on Romney’s tax returns? Was Romney ever issued amnesty?
2. Need to see Romney’s tax return to see how. There were two articles on this: Huffington Post and Rueters.
3. Would his tax return show the following: Paul Ryan’s financial disclosure forms for Congress that were made public, showed he and his wife own stake in 4 family companies that lease land in Texas and Oklahoma to.”
4. Did Paul Ryan benefit from news Congress received about the financial crisis in 2008 and would it show on his tax returns. Is there any truth to this story: “September 18, 2008 the day Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson broke the news to congressional leaders that they would have to approve a bailout to avert a complete meltdown of the financial system. gop theme song.....but a bitting sorcasim.
.
At last sully makes the best post he has ever mind and it is a reflection of his opinion as well.
Well this is not that much of a stupid comment from Romney on the Israel-Palestine thing. There is no settlement for peace on the rise, I don't see that happening in eight years no matter what the international community does. Obama has himself voted down staehood for Palestine, this was a wise decision. Fact of the matter is any Palestinian "government" will have too many direct ties to terror to be endorsed. Those two people's have been content to kill over this worthless stretch of land for centuries and that won't end until BOTH sides put down the hate and that is no one of mankind's strong points..
The United States should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and abides by past agreements.
The Obama administration has both funded and legitimized Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood while strongly pressuring Israel to retreat to the indefensible 1948 border lines, not recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital,. Also the Obama administration has implemented a de facto six-month freeze on arms sales to Israel. The hostile climate the Obama administration has created between the U.S. and Israel since this president took office does not enhance Israel’s confidence in a peace deal brokered by this administration.
Is that all you got...unfact checked BS from a radical site?
I guess you wouldn't believe it if it came from the horses mouth huh?
.
Funny thing is, 70% of Jews support Obama in this election.
Funny how sully thinks American stinker is a credible source of information.
kathy Sine - I am not jewish although I have many friends who are. Many of them live in Florida, and the problem is they want to vote for Romney. They are seniors, who stand to lose a lot if Romney/ Ryan get elected. Many of them are not that well off financially. How is it that they want to do that? It makes no sense to me.
.
Woolard's goose is cooked and because of this video! I guess you could call it a TV dinner!
Much like a pig with an apple in its mouth Woolard has a foot in his! Hah!
Romney has an attitude that should be dealt with the same as the French dealt with their problem during the French Revolution...OFF WITH THEIR HEADS.
It wouldn't matter he would still be flip-flopping around!
I love how the liberal and the OWS crowd refer to the bloody, frenzied French Revolution as the one they aspire to instead of the American Revolution. Maybe because deep down you know Obama is the tyrant! You would prefer to execute anyone you deem a 'threat' to your cause than face the truth, much like you rejoice when a conservative gets banned here! You don't want to hear apposing viewpoints, you just want to wallow in your ignorance with your compatriots!
xxx is a prime example. He accuses others but does nothing but spew hate and lies!
Re: #16
OK I get it now.
The way your mind works -- Take a statement someone makes - twist it - distort it - make a grand generalization out of it - state it as fact - and then believe it as truth.
Never mind that the 2 revolutions were about 2 completely different issues. Typical tea bagged republican non thought.
maphi-I do believe you've got it.
whom - everything has to be explained to you! The American Revolution was about Independence and getting rid of a tyrant. Today Obama is the tyrant! Which is why the liberal and OWS crowd aspire to the French Revolution. As Voiceinmyhead (apt name for all you liberals) stated: he didn't like Romney's attitude so "off with his head" like the French did during their revolution.
Wrong again sully gee sully keep on proving that you know less then a 5th grader. The American revolution was about the colonies not having a say in the government. The French revolution was caused by the wealthy who were eating good while the working man starved, see the wealthy French Aristocrats enjoyed tax freedom everyone else had to pay taxes, oh and for your information it was that same type of wealthy Aristocrats that gave rise to the legend of Robin Hood. You know what the republicans are creating in the US today.
Foriegn Policy - here is what matters
Is the world better off than 4 years ago?
Don't think so!!
4.5 million times better
Bin Laden DEAD....Oh yeah we are way better off....
That's right always look at the short term - the potential problems out there now are greater than we have faced in decades. In history, there are many times when the killing of the founder of a movement has only strengthened it, let hope that is not the case here. The violence in the Muslim world could point otherwise. 4.5 million? don't get the reference?
NBC/WSJ Poll: Approval of Obamas foreign policy plunges. Must be Bush's fault.
If you look back through history and not fox news history...you will find that when a democratic president is in office we as a country do far better in all areas of the world. You see greywolf we have to come in and clean up or clear up the mess you republicans start all the time. We are not the world cops as you clearly think we should be. You live by the fear tactics the the republicans always thrown down as that is all they have. Get real! Get a life! And stop listening to the lies that have no basis of truth....wow...
NBC/WSJ Poll: Approval of Obamas foreign policy plunges. Must be Bush's fault
I think even Obama is getting tired of that excuse.....maybe he will try using the Tsunami excuse this time.....
It's like a recipe.....4 scoops of Bush's Fault, with 2 ounces of Arab Spring, 4 pounds of Europe and a Dash of Tsunami......Bake it 3.5 years and Bing.....You have the answer to all our troubles....
GrayWolfl-All those things were true 8 years ago. And most of them were true 20 years ago.
And Bush is the one who made a disaster out of Iraq, and removed them as a steadying influence on Iran.
Darn I forgot ......6 Tons of Congress....
It is a shame it has come to this....when all we really need is On ounce of a Leader.
And the lying Ryan plan will address the budget some time around 2040, maybe. Funny how the budget is always the worst problem today yet every republican plan doesn't address the budget problem for at least 20 years or never.
And only during Democratic administrations.
whom - got facts? Didn't think so. The liberals here repeat the Democrat talking points that the reason the economy is still so bad is because the Republicans are not cooperating with Obama. Remember Obama and the Democrats who held both the houses in 2009 telling the Republicans to "either go along for the ride or go to the back of the bus"? Barney Franks also joked about Republicans suffering from post-bipartisan depression, indicating the Democrats had no intention of working with the Republicans. The liberals in the room thought it was oh-so-funny… then!
Ryan. who is known for his specificity about how the nation should move forward to address the fiscal challenges of debt, deficit, and entitlements. Mr. Obama, on the other hand, seems to be distancing himself as much as possible from his record as president and what that record reveals regarding his plans and intentions for America's future; instead, he is running a campaign of contempt and personal attacks against Mr. Romney.
Go back to American stinker sullly, I'm sure they would love your non opinion there.
sully, you must have missed this.

What's changed and when?
The democrats have no intention of working with republicans because republicans have no intention of working. They've not done anything to work with the dems in the house and have wasted time repealing obamacare 30 times even know they've known from the beginning will not pass the senate. They've released zero bills to create jobs instead they've voted to keep their own congressional healthcare benefits...you know the ones obamacare gives to everyone....that thing they want to take away. The house republicans apparently believe they should keep benefits they think the people don't deserve to have. They've voted to keep unnecessary oil subsidies. They've voted for needless deregulation policies....deregulation has never created a single job.....od how the GOP wants less regulation on the financial sector after all it's not like that was a major factor in what crashed the economy in the first place. Nice improvement there guys.
Oooh they've rewritten the rules to gives themselves more vacation. Gee wish I could "work" for two weeks and then take a whole week off. Cantor has already sent them on a break for the next two and half months after they just got off break a week and half ago
Now on Paul Ryan since he's so specific which loopholes in the tax code does he want to get rid of?
Where's the rest of his budget? You know the part that would actually make it possible to do all the things he claims will happen?
The GOP is the party of foreign policy illiterates and has not added one single solution of substance to any foreign policy issues. They still think the Soviets are coming and we're going to have to fight them off like Red Dawn. Rocky 4 was a long time ago.
Why is the Obama campaign allowing Paul Ryan to say that it was "Obama policies" at fault for the growing number of dependent people and the debt?
I'd like Ryan to name those Obama policies at fault.
He'll just tell a lot of lies. Ryan's a lost cause. Soon to be "former vice-presidential candidate Ryan."
BO...Are you serious.? It was Obama that escalated our debt to 16 trillion. It was Obama who removed the food stamp requirement that one must be working to qualify. It was Obama who has kept unemployment above 8% for 4 years , forcing people who would be working otherwise, to go on dissability.
Every statement a lie.
BO - if you can't figure that one out for yourself it would be a waste of time for anyone to try and explain it to you. You wouldn't want to believe it anyway! Like whom and Sad Chris your posts have no basis in facts, just the propaganda you hear from MSNBC!
Projecting yourself onto others sully typical say nothing post by the guy who reads American stinker.
Ryan's going to be on the WI ballot as Senator AND VP candidate and could end up losing BOTH! We can only hope!
I knew it! Ryan is keeping one eye on the prize. Gotta keep that government pension under close scrutiny.
Ryan got his mind on his money and his money on his mind. That poser ain't going to voluntarily leave government-- big or little!
Yeah, who was the President that got us in to the Viet Nam war. And who pulled us out?
Eisenhower got us in. Nixon got us out 'cause we made him.
Let's see WWII - Democrates - Korea - Democrates - Viatnam - Democrates (only advisors before) Not saying they were not justified - another whole question. To say that Dems don't get us into as many messes as Rep is silly. But what has Obama got us out of? The plan for leaving Iraq was negociated by Bush. Afganistan is a mess. The point of the 10 item is that nothing is better, only worst!
The point of your post is propaganda, nothing else.
The Chris..............One day when your kids are living under Obamas Shiria law, just call it propaganda.
What is not true?
turnout-Your statement definitely is.
graywolf-already answered.
Gray and Turnout - don't even bother to respond to SadChris. He is obviously not very smart, believes everything Ed says, then gets offended when anyone challenges Ed becasue in effect you are challenging his intelligence. SadChris and whom are a complete wastes of space and oxygen!
Romney/Ryan 2012!
And you are a dumbass racist jerk.
Liberals hate the truth and Romney told the truth. Obama has created a voting block of people who are expecting something from government, that is the truth and no one can deny it. I believe he will get re-elected because of these people. True americans do not take from government, true americans seek and find work and those who don't the liberals say, "come on in, we'll help you, here is some money for your drugs and for your booze, now remember to vote for us". This counrty will not be the same in 2016, if we survive that long under this clown.
It's been a long time coming. I think that Liberals just don't understand that Conservatives don't mind helping people but that it should be help that gets them on thier feet with dignity. We have spent trillions on proverty programs since the early '60s and the poor are in no better shape now. The percentage living under the poverty level is basicly the same or worst. So you can continue to do the same old programs which do not cure the problem or you can try something different. After I have hit my head against a wall for 50 years & it is not moving, I would hope I had the sense to change the present course of action. Liberals not only want to continue the same old but want to double down on what has not worked!
WASHINGTON — A look at where Democratic
President Barack Obama and Republican presidential rival ruling. Said he would end federal aid to Planned Parenthood.
___, but vital specifics are lacking. At same time would increase military
spending, reverse $716 billion in Medicare cuts and cut taxes. Favors
constitutional balanced budget amendment.
___
ECONOMY:
Obama: Term marked by high unemployment, a deep recession that began in
previous administration and gradual recovery. Persistently high jobless rates
over 8 percent — 8.1 percent in August, up from 7.8 percent in February 2009..
Romney: Endorses 2014 end to U.S. combat in Afghanistan, subject to
conditions at the time. Would increase strength of armed forces, including
number of troops and warships, adding almost $100 billion to the Pentagon budget
in 2016.
___.
@ dave 3254139; Romney generalized my friend. He put all 47% in the same box.
I can generalize too, why should the rich think they are "Entitled" to get paid millions for doing very little work? Come on, do these people really think they are worth that much over anyone else?
So the investor deserves a bigger return than the inventor?
Investors do not invent new things except when it comes to inventing ways to screw people over.
I will repeat, THE ONLY ONES WHO DESERVE TO MAKE MILLIONS FROM AN IDEA OR AN INVENTION ARE THE INVENTORS THEMSELVES and NOT THE INVESTORS. Investors should get no more than a couple % on the money they invest.
This is the primary problem in business. The people at the top think they are "Entitled" to make millions as compared to the ones who actually design and make the products.
So, let's get rid of that feeling of entitlement too.
I myself do not think I am entitled to anything from the government except a return on the taxes I pay. In other words, infrastructure investment, research investment, education investment and some protections for the consumers. That is what I feel we are all entitled to expect from our government. If you pay into SS and medicare, then you should expect a return on that future investment. If there is not a return, then you should not have to pay SS or medicare.
Why should we believe him this time?
Hey The Chris............I'll give you another chance. Now think hard, or maybe ask EDD or Maddow for a hint. Who was the president that got us in to the Viet Nam war and who got us out. ?
Already answered.
The Chris........Youre either to young to remember or you need to catch up on youtr history.
You can't remember a post from 5 hours ago.
Oh look-turnoutthelights has rereged already.
 1.
GOP failures give wealthy tax breaks and they create jobs. Only every republican president saw jobless recoveries gee and you whine democrats don't fix GOP problems fast enough. Here is a clue robme hood plans on more tax cuts to the wealthy the workers gets tax increases, so how is robme hood going to let someone keep more of what they work for when he plans on taxing them more. And we get another example of the tea bagged republican circle jerk.
999, I have a feeling most voters don't know this including that blogger you copied and pasted from.

You can not address serious budget matters by taking more from those with least to give that to those who did not need it. Taxing those already in financial hardship into further poverty will only result in those people more dependent on government. That is your solution you don't get to say that isn't the case because you don't want that, that's the consequence of what you advocate.

Title: 'If I were a fanatic
I'd let off nuclear bomb in Chicago': Romney brands Iran 'crazy people' in new
secretly filmed outburst

Mitt Romney’s White House bid took another blow last night after he appeared
to suggest a pro-Iranian terrorist could hold America to ransom by threatening
to blow up Chicago with a nuclear bomb..’
In another secretly filmed video clip, Mr Romney claimed there was no point
trying to appeal to Democratic voters because they were ‘freeloaders who don’t
pay taxes’.
‘There are 47 per cent who are with Barack Obama, who are dependent upon
government, who believe they are victims,’ he said.
‘These are people who pay no income tax. My job is not to worry about those
people.’
In another video, he fires a broadside at the Palestinians, saying: ‘I look
at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, committed to the
destruction of Israel, and I say there’s just no way [there will be peace].’
And he can be heard joking he would have an easier time winning the US election in November if his father had Mexican parents, instead
of being a state governor and wealthy car company boss.
In the same video, Mr Romney also tells how he considered investing in a
sweatshop-like factory in China when he was head of US private equity giant Bain
Capital.
The businessman – who recently criticised Mr Obama for ‘spending 43 months
failing to confront China’s unfair trade practices’ was given a tour of the
factory in the 1990s, where 20,000 women earned tiny wages and lived in squalid
conditions.
He said: ‘As we were walking through this facility, seeing them work, the
number of hours they worked the pittance they earned.
‘And around this factory was a fence, a huge fence with barbed wire and guard
towers. And we said gosh, I can’t believe that you, you know, keep these girls
in.
‘And they said, no, no, no. This is to keep other people from coming in.
Because people want so badly to work in this factory that we have to keep them
out’. US news channel CNN said sources revealed Bain did not invest in the firm
or buy it.
The videos, which were all taped during a $50,000-a-plate dinner for wealthy
donors in Florida, surfaced as the presidential campaign enters its final 50
days.
Snippets were placed online in YouTube films by Mother Jones, a liberal
magazine, which said it obtained them from a guest at the dinner hosted by
millionaire US financier Marc Leder on May 17.
The footage was unearthed with the help of former Democrat president Jimmy
Carter’s grandson, James, who is credited with ‘research assistance’ on its
website.
Last night, Jim Messina, Mr Obama’s campaign manager, said: ‘It’s shocking
that a candidate for President would go behind closed doors and declare to a
group of wealthy donors that half the American people view themselves as
‘victims’ entitled to handouts, and are unwilling to take 'personal
responsibility' for their lives.
‘It’s hard to serve as a president when you’ve disdainfully written off half
the nation.’
Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian lawmaker and scholar, said Mr Romney’s remarks
were ‘irresponsible and dangerous’.
However, the politician said he stood by the remarks which were ‘not
elegantly stated’.
The fundraiser where Romney made the fateful remarks was thrown in May by
hedge fund manager Marc Leder, who has developed a reputation as a party boy.
Mr Leder, who is worth a reported $400million, runs Sun Capital Partners in
Boca Raton, Florida.
The New York Post reports that he threw a lurid end-of-summer party in the
Hamptons last year at a mansion he rented for $500,000 a month.
The raucous gathering included at least one couple that stripped down naked
in the pool and then had sex on the pool deck in full view of other party
guests. All of this took place to the backdrop of go-go dancers, fire twirlers
and throbbing techno music.
Mr Leder, 50, reportedly kicked up his partying lifestyle after his wife of
22 years cheated on him with her 23-year-old tennis instructor.
Obama has been working hard to make political hay out of Romney's comments at
the fundraiser. During an interview with David Letterman late Tuesday, the
president accused his Republican challenger of dividing the nation.
'My expectation is that if you want to be president, you have to work for
everyone, not just for some,' he said. 'What I think people want to be sure of
is you are not writing off big chunks of the country because the way our
democracy works.'
He also criticized Romney for saying 47 percent of Americans think of
themselves as 'victims,' saying the American Dream is alive and well among all
of the voters he meets.
Romney didn't score marks for his choice of words -- even from his own
running mate, who called the comments 'obviously inarticulate.'
Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan made the comment in an interview aired
Tuesday by KRNV-TV in Reno,.
Meanwhile, Republican launched a counteroffensive in an attempt to regain
momentum. Appearing on Fox News on Tuesday, Romney pointed to a secret 1998 tape
of Obama saying he wants to redistribute wealth in the United States. Hitting
back: President Obama said Romney's remarks were not fitting for a national
leader. He said a president must represent all Americans
Hitting back: President Obama said Romney's remarks were not fitting for a
national leader. He said a president must represent all Americans
Then-Illinois state senator said: 'The trick is figuring out how do we
structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some
redistribution.
'Because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to
make to make sure everybody has got a shot.'
The audio of the tape was posted on YouTube on Tuesday and dated October
1998.
Romney says it shows a clear division between the vision of America that he
is offering and the ideals that Obama espouses.
'Frankly, we have two different views about America. The president’s view is
one of a larger government. There is a tape that came out where is the president
is saying he likes redistribution. I disagree,' Romney told Fox News. 'I think a
society based upon a government-centered nation where government plays a larger
and larger role, redistributes money, that’s the wrong course for America. That
will not build a strong America or help people out of poverty.'

I wish James Carter would find out if there is any footage on the the fundraiser Cheney held for Romney and unearth that. I bet that would be interesting.
This is like writing an essay and then you realize its so bad, you just throw it in the trash
So throw your essay in the trash.
I guess the peanut didn't fall far from the plant......President Carter...you are very nice person....but as president....you harmed this great country....just like Bush and Obama.

Overview Created by Ladyada This is a quick tutorial for our 128x64 and 128x32 pixel monochrome OLED displays. These displays are small, only about 1" diagonal, but very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display. Each OLED display is made of 128x64 or 128x. However, only the 128x64 display has all these interfaces available. For the 128x32 OLED, only SPI is available. Frankly, we prefer SPI since its the most flexible and uses a small number of I/O pins so our example code and wiring diagram will use that.

I’m an atheist who lives in the Midwest, so I’ve learned that religion can be touchy subject. After one incident where I was laughed at by group of people of probably fifteen peers for being an atheist (I was six years old, mind you), I almost needed therapy because I was so afraid of what my atheism could cause. I’ve talked to girls my age who have lost their best friends because they’re atheists (they live in the Midwest as well.) So my opinion is that the world would be so much better off if everyone stopped caring about what a person’s religion is and just went on with their business, instead of glaring at you or saying they’re disappointed or being nasty about it. If you’re Christian that’s great, if you’re Muslim that’s great, if you believe that magic fluffy unicorns rule the universe that’s great, but don’t shove your doctrines down my throat.— Callie
In my experience, people unaffiliated with religion tend to be tolerant of everyone. Not saying that religious people aren’t nice, just that I think more unreligious youth can make the world a more loving place. Or everyone can swallow any hatred they have for people not like them and the world can finally be at peace.
As of now I find myself affiliated with a religion. Mostly because I follow my parent’s footsteps. I see this also happening with my friends. I do agree that every generation people aren’t as religious. For example : my dad. My dad doesn’t worship/pray to our god everyday. As for my grandparents praying to god is a daily routine for them. I think young people are becoming less religious because of the diversity and exposure to different religions and cultures, Also there is a lot of technology and activities to do instead of believing in a religion. I also think people are becoming more busy to be committed to a religion, and in the end not believe in anything at all. t think for people to express their morals outside of worship services, depends on how serious do they believe in them. But for the most part I think people do. I think the decline of religious beliefs means that America is becoming more neutral and independent. So maybe the future generation would focus on other things and improving America.— Nisha S
I was raised going to a non-denominational Christian church, and although I sometimes preferred to sleep in on those early Sunday mornings, I was, for the most part, always receptive of the lessons and messages therein.
For me, religion serves a much greater purpose than believing just to believe. The church, or more specifically the Bible (bear with me here, I’m not trying to get all preachy, just share my perspective and experience) provides so much knowledge about the ins and outs of life (just look at Proverbs; so much knowledge in one book), how to deal with tough situations that we ALL still go through so many centuries later, and more. In addition to providing a means of wisdom and clarity, I believe my religion has played a role in shaping me to be a loving, genuine person. And although identifying with a religion is not necessarily a prerequisite for being a good/loving person, it definitely has the capability of roping in people who may not have otherwise explored the more compassionate components of themselves/their “souls.”
It’s highly unfortunate that there are people who claim to be religious/Christian and yet spread hate for the gay community, for example. (and believe it or not, there are some “Christians” who boast their hatred for minorities). I’m not sure what Bible they’re reading or what church they grew up in (most likely the church of some morally corrupt “Pastor” trying to spread his own f’d up views).
Believe me when I say: They, along with their corrupt, self-serving “beliefs,” are the minority. At least, I hope they are.
In sum, religion is more than a tool of seclusion, as some of the aforementioned misguided souls use it. In fact, it is a tool of INCLUSION. It helps to develop mature, compassionate souls. It also helps people to become strong, spiritually, and believe me, that definitely comes in handy as you progress in life and experience new (or even some old) challenges.
Not everyone feels like they have the strength they need to endure life’s challenges on their own, and not everyone has family or genuine friends there to help ease some of that burden. For those people, and for me, God is a source of strength when I can’t muster it up within myself. There have literally been days where I’ve had to pray for strength just to get up and do what I had to do for the day because of such psychological (and sometimes, emotional) exhaustion, and maybe it was just a fluke, but it works. It helps (and is necessary, even) to have a source outside of ourselves in which to rely for strength, wisdom, guidance, etc.
Some people might say that prayer/belief in God makes one weak, or that just because you pray for something and it happens doesn’t mean it’s real, but A) I’d rather be weak for praying than taking hard drugs/drinking more than is required for health reasons and potentially ruining my life/not living as productive a life as I could, and B) even if I am praying and it’s some massive coincidence when my prayers get answered, at the end of the day, they were answered, and I don’t know how or if they would otherwise have – so what’s the harm?
My theory is that the younger generations are straying from religion because of the people from older generations who claim religion and yet, hold contradictory beliefs such as “it’s okay to hate gays.”
As a Christian, my theory on homosexuality and, more specifically, government intrusion on marriage laws is this: the Bible does not advocate homosexual relations, but clearly God still gave people the free will to live and love as they choose, and so should the government. Government has no business interfering in such personal choices.
Also, just because the Bible doesn’t advocate homosexuality, doesn’t mean Christians were intended to spread hatred for them. That is just someone’s own f’d up interpretation, and is so not representative of the faith as a whole. Please, believe me when I say that. They should be ashamed. Maybe they would be if they had the proper cognitive function required to do so. (haha, ok, had to throw one in there)
So please, don’t let other peoples’ misguided takes on religion and what it means to be a Christian govern your own beliefs. If you don’t tend toward religion, that’s fine as well, I NEVER shove my beliefs down the throats of others or even make subtle hints to make people feel uncomfortable; nothing like that.— preppyblackgirl.tumblr.com
There’s a fundamental misunderstanding of atheism by non atheists. No one knows what causes it.— zack

Greetings, Learning Expressions Readers!
In October, we’ve got some very exciting reading-related events happening at our Learning Express stores! During the second week of the month, we’ll be celebrating both Read for the Record and the first annual Star Wars Reads Day. Wondering what these events are all about? Read on!
Read for the Record
For the last three years, millions of adults and children have helped support early literacy through Jumpstart’s Read for the Record event. On a single day (this year it’s October 4) millions of children around the country gather to read one single book—with the goal of setting a new reading record together. Last year, 2.2 million (!!) readers participated, all reading the adorable Llama Llama, Red Pajama by Anna Dewdney.
For an overview of the 2011 Read for the Record, tune in here:
The selection this year is Ladybug Girl and the Bug Squad by Jacky Davis and David Soman. The book delightfully documents one of the Bug Squad play dates (the Squad consisting of Ladybug Girl, Bumblebee Boy, Dragonfly Girl, and Butterfly Girl) and teaches a valuable lesson about friendship, feelings, and the beauty of compromise.
As Lulu and her friends romp through the forest and harness their super Bug powers, Lulu is thrilled that, “Everything is going just how she wanted it to!” But what happens when things don’t go exactly Lulu’s way? Well you’ll just have to read and find out! Join us next week on our Facebook page when we’ll be giving away a copy of the book every day of the week—or if you can’t wait that long head over to We Give Books and read it online!
Make sure that you also pledge to read that day, so your numbers can be added to the grand total reading tally!
Star Wars Reads Day
May the force of literacy be with you! On October 6, we’ll be celebrating the very first Star Wars Reads Day. Star Wars Reads Day was created by Lucasfilm with the purpose of celebrating reading and Star Wars. There are over 1000 official events across the country, including many at Learning Express stores. The events will feature story times, character visits, as well as crafts and activities. Get in touch with your local store to see exactly what fun they have planned.
We hope you join us at one of these fun filled events next week, and don’t forget to visit us on Facebook for your chance to win a copy of Lady Bug Girl and the Bug Squad!
Talk to you again soon!

All of the chicks are very sociable, and when we talk to them or approach the tank, they run to get as close to us as they can, and they jump up and down trying to get to us. They enjoy being held, and the boys made them a "playpen" by cutting the sides off two large cardboard boxes and taping them together to make a fence, then we put a paper tablecloth left over from a birthday party on the floor inside the pen, and let them run around. So far, our cats are not interested in being around them when they are out, and our dog acts like he's afraid of them!
Anna Comstock's Handbook of Nature Study has a section on chicks, and it includes some wonderful information for turning a study of chicks into a lesson. She writes about the "chicken ways," describing how to teach children the "details" of chicks, from the egg tooth and downy feathers, to the ways they eat, sleep, and communicate. There is also a discussion on the differences between chickens and "perching birds." I read this section first, and then I talked about it with my boys and read passages to them. We looked at our chicks and observed the details Anna Comstock wrote about. I followed the prompts in the book to ask the boys questions about their observations of the chicks and about what they remember from our visit to the farm where we got the eggs. If you haven't seen this book, it is a wonderful resource for science and nature study and is a complete field guide as well. I have used it countless times since we began our homeschool journey, and it has become one of my go-to resources. It has a place on our bookshelves, but it is usually out on my desk or on the table being used. No matter what grade your children are in, this book makes a great starting point for science, covering teaching methods for nature study, animals, plants, earth, and sky. The internet archive has the book free online. (It is over 850 pages long, so beware before you start to print it.)
In addition to the handbook, we have visited our local feed and seed store a few times to get chick starter feed, and have ended up spending a half hour each time talking to the knowledgeable staff and farmers who stop in. The boys have loved visiting the baby chicks, turkeys, ducks, and mama cat and kittens who inhabit this wonderland, and we have brought home some vegetable plants for our garden. These visits have become weekly field trips. We bought a couple of hobby farm magazines with articles on chickens to learn more about taking good care of our little chicky-babies.

Recharge Your Life!
I better remember to tell my sister “Thank you!” For one thing, she is always there for me: nudging me into action with a kind word or a kick in the pants, collaborating on how to best help our elderly parents, listening to complaints about bills and insurance, or just sending words of good cheer and encouragement. But this specific nod of appreciation is for giving me a great little book: Oil for Your Lamp: Women Taking Care of Themselves (2010, Simple Truths, LLC). The book shares a deceptively simple message, but if taken to heart its truth can be life-changing.
The authors, Lisa Hammond & B.J. Gallagher, present stories, poems, photos and advice to illustrate the wisdom of Mother Teresa’s words: “To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.” The book is divided into two sections: How & Why We Let Our Lamps Run Low and How to Fill Our Own Lamps. The first section reminds readers how easy it is to let doing too much and doing for others take over our lives. In part, women are socialized to be care-givers—of others, not of ourselves. And we have internalized that expectation too well, giving it more and more control as we master the art of multi-tasking.
For me, one of the best features of the book is the many quotes interspersed throughout from a wide array of sources, including everyone from Mother Teresa & Oprah to Winnie the Pooh & Mark Twain. These quotes trumpet the lessons offered in the second section of the book. The advice on how to recharge is what sounds so simple, as it reminds readers of what we often know but do not put into action in our day-to-day lives. The basics include realizing it is okay to put ourselves first, to ask for help, and to simply do nothing at times. My favorite advice is the challenge to follow the edict so often given to children: Go outside and play! Personally, my playtime usually involves a sojourn into Nature—or taking a nice long catnap.
The book and its simple direct message are great gifts! Think about giving them to others. If someone gives the book to you, be sure you remember to say “thanks.” Paying attention to what is good and right in your life—perhaps through a gratitude journal—can help you keep life’s demands in perspective, which in turn can help you set the best priorities for yourself. So, the next time you are taking a day to detox, laying down for a nap, or saying “no” to a new commitment, also remember to give thanks. Of course, there is a lot in life worthy of appreciation: acts of kindness, words of hope or encouragement, a helping hand, a positive attitude, just an awareness of life’s blessings, or even the beauty of Nature. So count your blessings and jump-start the re-charging process!
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go call my sister—and maybe send some flowers to a friend.
“Don’t under estimate the value of doing nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things we can’t hear, and not bothering.” Winnie the Pooh
“If you neglect to recharge a battery, it dies. And if you run full speed ahead without stopping for water, you lose momentum to finish the race.” Oprah Winfrey

UGA Recruiting: Jump on Board “OR” Get Left Out
The Georgia Bulldogs are taking a different approach for the class of 2014 than they did for the 2013 one. At this point last year the Bulldog coaches knew they were going to be able to sign anywhere from 32-36 guys, but things are a little tighter this year. Right now it seems that Georgia will be able to sign anywhere from 18-22 guys in this class. The stressful part of that is, who is a take and who is not? The Bulldogs are in the lead or in the lead group for a bunch of guys, but Georgia does not have the numbers to take them all. Here is a breakdown by position for the 2014 class.

So Republicans are responding to the new Priorities USA ad featuring Bain layoff victim Joe Soptic, who lost his job and health insurance in 2001 and whose wife died of cancer in 2006, with a new web video focusing almost entirely on the question of whether or not Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter was correct when she said she didn't know exactly when Soptic's wife passed way.
But what I can understand is why they don't want to deal with the issue raised by the Priorities USA ad: Mitt Romney's lack of concern for people like Joe Soptic. Romney made millions on the deal involving Soptic's company, but Soptic was left holding the bag: out of a job and without health insurance. Within five years, his wife?who herself had lost health insurance from another job?died of cancer.
Nobody can say for sure if Soptic's life would have been saved if she'd had health insurance. But one thing we do know is that if Obamacare had been in effect when Soptic was laid off, she would have had health insurance and access to to the health care that might have saved her life. In fact, Romney's campaign tried to defend itself yesterday by saying basically the same thing, arguing that if Soptic had been in Massachusetts, Romneycare would have provided coverage.
That would have been a good argument to make, but Mitt Romney has now abandoned Romneycare. If he gets his way, Obamacare will be repealed, jeopardizing the health security of families just like Joe Soptic's. Romney once supported taking Romneycare national, but when it became politically inconvenient, he flip-flopped to save his own skin. And that's what Mitt Romney has always been about: ruthlessly putting himself first. That's why Joe Soptic got the raw end of the deal when Mitt Romney was CEO and sole owner of Bain Capital. That's why Mitt Romney made millions even when his investments went bankrupt, putting employees out of work, destroying their retirement funds, and kicking them off insurance. That's why Mitt Romney has never made a promise he wouldn't break for the right price. And that's why Mitt Romney is not what this country needs as president.
Republicans want to dismiss Soptic's story as being the equivalent of an accusation of murder. But that's not what it is. It is, however, an accusation of callousness. The central point of the ad is that Mitt Romney put his own interests ahead of others, a pattern that we see continued to this very day with Romney's abandonment of his signature policy achievement, Romneycare. The fact that Republicans refuse to defend Romney on the merits and instead try to shift the debate into hyperbole and irrelevancy speaks volumes about just how weak Romney's position is on this very point, and Democrats can't afford to walk away from this fight.

For starters, my new website is up and running! Please visit for a look at designer Kathleen Kearns' fabulous work on my behalf, and learn all about, well, me. In answer to the question many of you have already asked – yes, those are my daughter, Ada's, drawings of birds, butterflies and bees gracing the pages.
Secondly, the audio version of the first knitting book I ever wrote, Knitting Lessons, is now available from Knitting Out Loud. A little-known fact: the first 20 people to purchase it from the KOL site will be entered in a drawing to win a signed first edition of the print book. Signed by me, that is. So don't delay!
Finally, for those of you who have been inquiring after John Howe, the Brooklyn Bee Man who was the inspiration for my first children's book (to be published by Schwartz & Wade), here's an update: John and his two colonies of bees have been very busy indeed this summer on their Fort Greene rooftop. Thanks to a relatively mild winter, John had an early, abundant harvest of honey at the beginning of July and has been selling jars of it at Provisions in Fort Greene, and Marlow and Sons in Williamsburg. Supplies, as always, are extremely limited so hie on over to either location to stock up. John reports that the honey from one colony tastes strongly like mint, while the second colony produced a honey that is floral and fairly light. If all goes well, he hopes to make a second harvest closer to Autumn. Stay tuned to this newsletter for more honey updates, for info on John's wildflower seed giveaway (coming up in late September) and of course, news about the book.

Accident as."
Types [edit]
Physical and non-physical [edit]
Physical examples of accidents include unintended collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, or electrical, or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a secret or otherwise saying something incorrectly, forgetting an appointment, etc.
By activity [edit]
- Accidents during the execution of work or arising out of it are called work accidents. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than 337 million accidents happen on the job each year, resulting, together with occupational diseases, in more than 2.3 million deaths annually.[1]
- In contrast, leisure-related accidents are mainly sports injuries.
By vehicle [edit]
- Bike accidents
- Tram accidents
- Traffic collisions
- Sailing ship accidents
Most common causes [edit].[2] The United States also collects statistically valid injury data (sampled from 100 hospitals) through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System administered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.[3] This program was revised in 2000 to include all injuries rather than just injuries involving products.[3] Data on emergency room visits is also collected through the National Health Interview Survey.[4]

Last year I posted a MOUNTAIN of goals, plans and intentions for 2010.
I did about ….. half of them. And some of those were trips and things I would have done whether I made the list or not.
So this year – 2011 – I am going WAY easier on myself and just choosing three BIG IDEA intentions for how to live 2011.
Have more fun
This was Andrew’s idea, actually.
We already have a TON of fun together….. Piles and piles of fun… I love that kid.
But you can never have too much fun with your beloved…. right?
Don’t waste my own time.
Stop reading books that bore me.
Delete photos that bore me.
Stop putting forth effort to be friends with people who aren’t kindred spirits.
Unsubscribe to blogs that I don’t care about.
I have *plenty* of stuff I WANT to do …. I don’t want to fill my hours making myself do things I feel like I SHOULD do.
Grow Lemon and Raspberry with love and intention.
I have plans. Big plans. But I want all growth for this site to be organic (even though I *hate* that word). I just mean I don’t want to do any gimmicks to get numbers added to my newsletter list or Google Friend Connect. Not worth my time.
I only want readers who WANT to be here.
And if you DO want to be here – I won’t let you down!
2011 is going to be an AWESOME year….
Right?? Right.
Thanks for joining me today for the blog party! I think (I *think) I want to make this an annual occurrence ….
If you came for the giveaways – I hope you stay for the other content!
If you come visit me at Lemon and Raspberry every day regardless of giveaways – you are my FAVORITE!
Happy New Year!!!!!!

On the 5th day of every month, we celebrate Cinco de Linco Day. On this day, we encourage everybody to make a $5 loan for a family on Lend4Health. (Cinco = "five" in Spanish, and "Linco" is for Pres. Lincoln on the $5 bill)
Cinco de Linco was started by a Lend4Health supporter, lender, and two-time loan recipient named Jeanne. She wanted to show people that everybody can participate in Lend4Health, and that even $5 can have a powerful impact on a family.

SUMMARY
Thai criminals kidnap Andrew’s five-year old daughter from their home in a secure Moo Baan (Gated Community) in Bangkok, and his Thai wife blames him. After two years of heartache, it seems they have lost Jennifer for good and their happy marriage comes under so much pressure that he feels he will soon lose his wife, as well.
However, after months of steady research, he conceives an amazing plan. He studied the great long jump champions of the past, and noticed how their amazing feats attracted worldwide publicity. He discovers a new power or procedure that he can use to match or even surpass their records, which will result in worldwide publicity.
He recruits his grandson Jason, to help him prepare for this great challenge. However, he is too old for serious competition, so he enters a local UK athletics event. On the day of the competition, he uses his new technique and is so successful he soon has the whole world clamouring for information. However, things start to go wrong.
When the tremendous publicity of his long jump reaches a peak, disaster looms from a suggestion he is cheating, or taking drugs. This appears to bring Andrew’s plan to find his daughter and save his marriage to a halt. Discover how, despite Jason’s fumbling help and mistakes, he overcomes all obstacles until he is able to put into action the final stage of his amazing plan.
You will find mystery, excitement, fantasy, romance and much more as the story continues. Written by Brian Hunt, the bestselling author of “Michael’s Irish Magic” and “The Dariwn Manuscript”.
AUTHOR’S COMMENTS
I found it difficult to classify this novel, because it falls into many categories.
There is a great deal of suspense and action in the early part, which covers the abduction and the immediate consequences. But then as in so many cases of child-abduction, the family goes into a kind of limbo, wondering what steps to take next. So it is in the novel.
At this point, two things happen.
1. The hero finds he has an amazing power, which he realises he can use to great effect in trying to re-unite his family.
2. His grandson, looking for a new career, comes to live with him.
The story now has two interleaved threads and becomes interesting as the well-matched pair work together on honing the hero’s new power, and make plans on how to put it to good use. This is a complex novel, quite long, but well worth the effort in reading it!
EXCERPT
“Please tell me you’re not honestly serious about this long-jump scheme, Andrew. I listened to your theories and arguments this morning, and they all sounded practical and genuine enough, but mate, look at you. You’re a gangling sixty-nine year old grandfather without a muscle on his body; my God mate, a thirteen-year old girl can jump further than you can—please give up this crazy idea right now. Don’t embarrass yourself and the family, Andrew.”
David reached under his deckchair for a beer, but finding nothing there, he said, “If you really must exercise, pop into the kitchen and get a couple of beers, and then the pair of us can sit down and have a good laugh about it.”
Andrew ignored his brother’s cynical comments, and without even looking at him walked to the start of the run-up path, as the vibrations began to build up in his body. He turned around, looked down the path towards the sandpit, and then started his ungainly run, wavering as he passed David’s reclining figure.
“Go on my son,” called out David, sarcastically and enthusiastically shouting his brother on as if he was the favourite horse in the two o’clock at Epsom Racecourse. “That’s the way, mate, give it some stick…”
His voice tailed off as Andrew suddenly picked up speed about ten yards from the take-off board, almost sprinted like a young man, and leaped skywards over the sandpit. With an open mouth, he saw his brother sail across the sand and land gracefully in the grass beyond the pit.
David jumped to his feet, “What the hell!”

I love the legend of Jesse James, will definitely have to see this movie. My Mom lived in southeastern Okla where the James gang hung out in the local caves. My great grandfather even had some run ins with Belle Starr. He stood guard outside her house when she died to make sure the rest of her family didn’t finish her off.
There was the rumor that his murder was a set up. I later got a small booklet from the Jesse James museum in Missouri that documented that the “real” Jesse James actually lived to be 103 True of false it’s very interesting.
A very informative article/interview. Thanks for linking this post to my own post about the film.

Banks is a really intriguing singer/songwriter from LA. I can’t find a whole lot of information on her at the moment, but the track that first caught my attention is ‘Before I Ever Met You’ – a dark, bass-heavy ode to toxic relationships. Imagine if Rihanna got tired of Chris Brown and collaborated with Massive Attack – this is what I reckon it would sound like.
If you prefer your music a bit more uptempo, then you should listen to the collaboration that Banks did with Lil Silva. I fully expect to hear this played to death during London Fashion Week, and if it’s not, well…that’s a shame. This sounds like such fashion music - I mean, it’s even called ‘Work’!

Oh, LEOnes~~~~~~WIdewylde OPEN hugs.
keep breeeething. IN and OUT.
*sores* hurt, they just DO
*****************************
and i like the J. K-Zinn quote.
did u know I took a meditation course by him (from a woman doc. who learned from him) ?? Mindfulness Based Stress reduction. I still listen to the “body-scan” med. CD & it Helps me a lot.
Hugs inTO U.
oh Leonie.
wrapping my arms around you.
stroking your hair.
listening.
sitting with it…with you.
something tells me that you need to be outside a lot through this. outside in nature where your uncle can speak to you through the wind, the leaves dancing, the sunlight on the water, and the ripples in a lake.
i hope it’s okay that i shared that with you.
i am here if you need me…
loving you. xoxoxo
Oh Leonie, I am so sorry for your grief. All the platitudes in the world don’t help when the grief is fresh. And you’re right, just sitting with it until everything else balances out is the best well to survive it.
I’ll say a prayer for you and your Uncle.
Take care of yourself.
Chris
aka Bright Phoenix
Leonie~
I agree with Bohemian Girl. I too think you need to be outside for this. It is much easier to ride the waves of emotions, especially grief when you are boxed in.
Step outside, breath deeply. Know that your uncle is also on his own journey. One that we both know isn’t coming to an ending. It is a beginning.
all my love to you leonie. reaching my hands to where you are to help hold you up and keep you strong in your time of need.
love,
Dawn
What beautiful pictures and beautiful, raw, honest words.
“there is duality in my seeing,
i am living both in the spirit world of knowing it will be and is okay,
and in the human world of feeling sadness and grief.”
From what I have read here on your blog, you seem to be such a free spirit ~ I agree that it seems only natural that being outside and allowing the sun to shine it’s grace upon your face, the wind to flow through your hair and nature to remind you of the spiritual truth you speak of will make this time easier to process and feel.
You are in my thoughts….
Thea
you alreday sound like you are working through your grief beautifully…they are always with us! I like the thought that we all remember we are buddah…that is a very beautiful thought to me

So I was enchanted when I found some illustrations from a little book titled
The Architect and Builder's Miscellany, or Pocket Library, Containing Original Picturesque Designs in Architecture, for Cottages, Farm, Country, and Town Houses, Public Building, Temples, Green Houses, Bridges, Lodges, and Gates for Entrances to Parks and Pleasure Grounds, Stables, Monumental Tombs, Garden Seats, etc.I found the drawings in the New York Public Library Digital Gallery, a terrific resource for anyone interested in period pictures of all types. With a little research, I discovered that the author of the book, and its illustrator, was Charles Middleton [1756-c.1818]. He was an architect and a surveyor, and had done work for the Prince of Wales on Carlton House. He presented designs over several years at the Society of Artists and the Royal Academy. Middleton published at least four books of designs and this was one of his most popular, first published in 1799, and still advertised, in the Edinburgh Review, in 1827.
I found a copy of the book at Sims Reed Rare Books. It was available for purchase at £1800 and it seems to have sold! A rare book indeed...
The illustrations at NYPL are all house plans, and they run the gamut from classic architecture to the cottage ornee to the downright eccentric. Here is a little folly with five rooms on the main floor, and an unknown number above. I love the conical thatched roof, and just look at the way the rooms are fitted in the circular space!
Then there is the classic design of a small home at the top of this post (its most attractive feature, I think, is the lovely fanlight over the door) and a larger classical house below. This rather austere house has a standard floor plan except for the 'Dressing Room' which connects to the Dining Room and the Library. What is that about?
The cottage ornee below seems to have a charming ground floor plan that offers all the neccessities of space, and the upper rooms must have been very interesting. Unfortunately the scan is a little pale, but again there is a 'Dressing Room' to the right of the front entrance just before you enter the Study. Is this the equivalent of our 'powder room'?
The elevation of the last house that I will offer is, I think, less than pleasing but the floor plan has its merits. The small room labelled "Cabinet" has distinct possibilities for reading, writing and retreat.
I notice that each floor plan offers an "Anti-room" on the Ground Floor. I am wondering if this was an innovation that only Charles Middleton included in his houses, or if it was a well-known addition to the Georgian house. My copy of "Georgian and Regency Houses Explained" does not mention such a thing.
I wish that there were plans of the upper floors in this book, but there were only 60 aquatint plates, and I expect space was at a premium given the quantity of structures listed in the extended title of the book. I would love to see the other types of illustrations--Monumental Tombs? Gates for Entrances to Parks and Pleasure Grounds?
Nothing fires my imagination like a building which my characters can inhabit. Am I alone in this? Do you love houses?
'Til next time,
Lesley-Anne

I DO love houses and architecture. I think if I had to choose another profession other than writer, architect would be it.
These pictures are so wonderful. And yes, how strange to have a dressing room next to the dining room. I wonder if it was meant as a gentler way to say "retiring room"?
Great post as usual Lesley-Anne.
You certainly could be right, Anne. Although the rooms designated are quite spacious, bigger than necessity would require :)
Thanks for visiting!

Sure, but by my argument, that would just hurt me. I'd get reminded of MoR early when I would just be looking at my email..
While in most types of fights killing is usually easier and safer than disabling, it is neither ruthless nor practical but simply short-sighted to lose track of why you are fighting.
There are plenty of situations where killing your enemy bears great costs. Maybe it would expose you to revenge from someone more powerful; maybe it would lead you to waste years of your life in court if not prison. Maybe it would be a massive PR victory for those who oppose you, undermining the entire plan that brought you into a fight in the first place (sounds familiar?). Maybe it would prevent you from obtaining critical help or information from the defeated enemy; the list could go on.
Of course preserving your own life has tremendous value (I heard there's a saying among some policemen: "an ugly trial is better than a beautiful funeral"), but it is not an absolutely incommensurable value. For a certain subset of X and Y in ]0,1[², you would accept an X chance of losing your life to a not-quite-dead enemy in exchange for a Y chance of not wasting decades of life (arguably), or (certainly) of not dying later on to unstoppable revenge.
All of the above being pretty much a very long-winded way of rephrasing Prof. Quirrell's dismissal that "there is a time and place to take your enemy alive, and a Hogwarts classroom is usually one of those".
I never got the impression that Harry's "Intent To Kill" thing included any tendency whatsoever to forget why he was fighting. The lesson here is completely distinct from being gratuitously stupid.
I disagree.
First, Quirrell very clearly asked Harry to think of combat uses for items in the classroom; that his thinking automatically restricted itself to lethal uses shows a serious flaw in his on-the-spot strategic abilities. This particular example is a good one, since his killing ideas quickly became worthless, but had he considered other aspects of combat he would have come up with a lot of much more useful options, such as using desks as barricades.
Secondly, Quirrell's quiz test is closely followed by two entire chapters devoted to Harry's highly dangerous tendency to escalate fights beyond the point where he could expect the best reward-to-risk ratio (George Patton once said: "Don't fight a battle if you don't gain anything by winning"). Deciding from the start that the enemy must die, without even fleetingly considering if other options may be preferrable, is clearly part of this problem.
I realise, as I write this, that there is a possibility we may be talking about two distinct things. As I read it in the text, by "intent to kill" Quirrell referred to Harry's reflexive interpretation of any fight as a fight to the death. If you are, instead, using the phrase to refer to the willingness and psychological ability to kill (whereas most regular people would find themselves instinctively aiming their knives away from vital points, and so on), then I have no disagreemen.
Also note that in the lesson "intent to kill" is not presented by Quirrel as purely good thing, nor is Harry called the most capable warrior or the best kid to have your back in the fight but the most dangerous student, an epithet that could well apply to the cadet with the worst trigger discipline. It appears that intent to kill goes along with a lack of squeamishness about violence, and it may be easier to teach Harry about the proper uses of violence than to train Draco to be unaffected by it, but that does not mean that intent to kill is itself a good thing
I'm actually speaking of neither of those things. Instead I speak of the things I allude to in my initial comment. Similar language is used to express related concepts fairly often in books on strategy as well as Eliezer's document on the virtues of rationality. I have also specifically asserted that I am not referring to the somewhat distinct concept on picking idiotic fights..
Huh? Why is yaoi fandom the relevant population?
Ah, I see what is going on. When Pavitra wrote "thinks Harry/Draco is hawt", did he mean "thinks Harry is sexy and/or thinks Draco is sexy" or did he mean "thinks that the concept of a romantic relationship between them is an exciting concept"?
FYI, X/Y is read "X slash Y" and is a way of calling out a ship.
Cool. Thx. I'm more ancient than I like to admit, and this is my first fanfic experience. I'm very proud that I didn't have to look up "ship".
I however did -- because I didn't find my correct guess plausible. (An apostrophe would help: " 'ship ".)
(Imagine if I wrote: "It was my first ence of that sort." You might be able to guess that "experience" is the most likely meaning, but it would need verification and still feel weird afterward.)
I also don't understand "call out": does it mean "refer to", or "advocate"?
I had to look it up too, but I do note that the changed usage of ship vs relationship makes leaving off the apostrophe appropriate. 'Relationship' can't be used as a verb!
I'm tempted to start using "ence" as an abbreviation for "experience". I like the sound of it and it seems like a word that deserves a monosyllabic version.
The word already has a monosyllabic version (exp) but it is interesting to note that an "ence" variant is probably still warranted. I would still use 'experience' in the places where people may abbreviate to ence, because it feels right to my intuitions. "Exp" is a resource that I acquire but experiences, they are things to be savoured. I want to be fully present, in the moment for the full three syllables. In the same vein I would 'ship' combinations I was somewhat distancing myself from or perhaps considering particularly abstractly but I would never consider using that jargon in relation to Harry and Hermione for example. If I didn't use 'relationship' I would rephrase the context such that another word or phrase (connection? or 'author conveyed a bond between'?) fit the context.
I like Ence as a separate word from Exp for two reasons. First, Exp is very strongly tied to a meaning in games that is in important ways opposite from the meaning we would want Ence to have. And second, I don't think "exp" counts as properly monosyllabic; the monosoyllabic prononciation /eksp/ has a consonant cluster that many languages and English dialects don't allow in speech, causing speakers to automatically expand it to /ek.spi/.
I know people who use "tech" for "technique," "grade" for "upgrade," etc. Once you get used to it, it really is more efficient, but at the price of making it more difficult for outsiders to understand what you're saying.
Bah. Those two abbreviations are terrible. People use those? There is no context where tech(nique) is used in which the existing use of tech(nology) wouldn't be appropriate, given that techniques can be considered technology. Why oh why would you not use 'nique' or 'niq'? I suspect I would be willing to signal myself as an outsider so as to avoid sacrificing my dignity like that!
For a while I've wondered what exactly Robin Hanson is doing (what he's trying to signal, perhaps? I don't know) when he uses abbreviations like "med", "docs", "tech", etc. (Pretty sure there are other common ones not coming to my mind right now.) He doesn't otherwise come off as a lazy writer, he can't really pass for "folksy" (and super-contrarian econblogging isn't quite the right context for that anyway), they aren't difficult or cumbersome words...
This is the characteristic feature of jargon. (And fanfic has its jargon like anything else.)
I've seen "tech" for "technology" but not for "technique". Interesting.
In this context, it means something like "name" or "denote".
The latter. And I talked about yaoi fans because Eliezer did.?
Very good point. My objection is rendered moot.
While this is also a relevant point, I would expect it to have nearly the opposite effect. Before puberty, identification with a sexual orientation would have to be completely socially constructed, so in a gay-friendly society most people should identify as bisexual by default.
This is not the case. Many gay people know that they are gay at a young age, often well before puberty. Or they realize that they are somehow different from the others around them. Human sexuality is not as simple as an on-off switch with the whole system coming into play when people hit puberty.
A society can be gay-friendly and still heteronormative. In fact, I'd say that contemporary First-World youth fit right into that, although gay-friendliness hasn't spread to the whole society yet. Still, as long as heterosexuals are most common, gays and bis will still be seen as unusual, even if OK. So socially, I expect that most people will still assume that they're het until they learn otherwise.
However (contradicting both you and me), there are gay people who say that they knew that they were gay from a very young age. On the other hand, puberty has been known to mess with one's expectations.
Generalising from one example: I can't quite describe the environment that I grew up in as gay-friendly, only moving in that direction. Perhaps if it had been, then I'd have identified as bisexual at puberty, but perhaps not. In any case, it was a heteronormative environment, so I expected to be attracted to the opposite sex, and was. Then I jumped to conclusions, self-identified as het and suppressed my attraction to the same sex (ETA: because it messed with my idea of who I was) for another ten years. (Before puberty, I was completely asexual.)
On reflection, I was generalizing from one example as well. I was pretty sexual-hangup-y as a kid. I didn't begin to suspect I was gay until I was seventeen, and it was another two or three years after that before I was comfortable with the idea that I had a sex drive at all.
Actually, I've just thought of more stuff. Why would there be gender-segregated dorms in this world?
Unless they're trying to deliberately encourage homosexuality in teenagers as a strategy for avoiding accidental teen pregnancy. This would also explain Lupin's possible attitude (though I may be misreading) that homosexuality is a thing for the young, while adult relationships tend to be heterosexual.
On the other hand, if this were the case, I would expect the childhood sexuality taboo to only apply to heterosexuality, in which case Lupin shouldn't have had the "when you're older" reaction to telling Harry about Sirius and Peter's relationship.
Remember also that the girls' dorms are magically protected against boys, but not conversely (at least in Gryffindor, at least midway in Harry's career). IIRC, Hermione derides the rule as old-fashioned (but then, she's Muggle-born, so that proves nothing).
A wise strategy, I would think. One reason why teen pregnancy rates are higher in the more relgious areas of the United States?
This was the attitude of the classical Greeks (and then Romans), at least for men.
I think that has more to do with the idea that it's immoral to provide kids with sex education. (This theory would be falsified if there's a significantly larger difference in teen pregnancy than in teen STDs.)
The real answer, of course, is that Hogwarts is shaped after British public schools, and it inherited gender-based dorms just like it did the four-house system.
A possible justification/rationalisation is that there are drastically different dynamics between a sexual attraction that involves a vast majority of the population, and one that involves a minority: heterosexual affections are much more likely to be potentially returned, compared to homosexual ones. Hence, while the occasional homosexual affair will sprout up in an all-male/all-female dorm, a mixed teenage dormitory would be completely overrun with drama, awkwardness, and unpleasant sounds and smells.
I can think of a good reason for segregated dorms: In the MoRniverse at least, rape is something aristocratic boys can do casually with the full expectation of getting away with it. Not to mention panty raids and other assorted sexually-harrassing nonsense. Even in a society without medieval/Victorian mores, girls would still need a place of relative safety in which to sleep, shower, dress, etc..
This is a good point.
Is there a specific reason to be significantly more concerned about male-on-female rape than the other three combinations?
Well, in practice, it seems to be a lot more common. Certainly a lot more reported.
It's by far the most common, outside of certain highly artificial settings that don't apply to Hogwarts.
Boarding schools and prisons create similar social scenarios. I believe male-male rape/harassment/"hazing" is/was a significant problem in many all-male British boarding schools.
Fraternities fit into more or less the same category, and likewise frequently feature various forms of ritualized homosexuality. It just isn't considered acceptable to acknowledge this; being the receptive partner in gay male sex has been considered damaging to masculinity for thousands of years, in at least the West and Japan.
I'm not sure 'by far' is appropriate in this context. In the US, for instance, 91% of reported rape victims are female and 9% are male, with estimates usually of about 10% reporting for males and 40% reporting for females, which would yield an actual rate of about 28% of rape victims being male. That's hardly an inconsiderable number.
Though I'm not sure how many of those are in prison, however.
Where are you getting your numbers? They sound to me like they come from the National Crime Victimization Survey. These are not reports to police, but the result of asking random people if they have been raped. I don't think that they sample prisoners, so they are probably highly biased against prison rape, but should catch some.
I presume you refer to, for example, prisons? Anywhere with sex based segregation and artificially enforced proximity (that rules out ostracism.)
Yes, I had prisons in mind.
I know it's by far the more common in the real world, but MoR!Hogwarts seems to differ significantly in the politics of gender and sexuality from most of real life, and I wanted to investigate how those differences would affect this situation. Since I don't yet have a clear theory of mind regarding why rape occurs or is gender-biased, I was trying to gather explanations from the rest of the peanut gallery.
I must have missed the part where we see that MoR!Hogwarts in general differs in gender politics and sexuality than most of real life, except for the "girls can compete in contact sports/armies with boys" bit, but that's a logical consequence of inherent equality of magical power. Lupin and Harry accepted a Peter/Sirius relationship without any squick, but Harry's a child of the Enlightenment (who, by dint of his uber-prodigy-ness likely didn't have jock-type macho-boys or religious conservatives as his formative peer group) and Lupin's a member of a disadvantaged minority himself. Do we have any evidence that someone like Lucius Malfoy would not be about as homophobic as the average medieval baron, of the sort who would teach his son that raping uppity peasant girls with impunity is one of the bennies that comes with "good breeding?" Or that, say, Seamus Finnigan wouldn't have the same kind of teen-boy homophobia/bullying reaction that's fairly common in our world?
Where is this number coming from? The incidence rate of male homosexuality is pretty low and guys are generally less likely to go squee over things anyway.
I heard it somewhere.
WIkipedia says that estimates range from one to twenty percent, and I would expect most estimates to be low because living in a still largely homophobic society biases reporting.
Yet often those making the estimates try to compensate for that bias, particularly those who are motivated to report higher statistics.?
IMO you aren't missing anything. I found your depiction of Hermione's reaction, and Harry's reaction to her reaction, quite realistic. The other commenters are demanding 12-year-olds to be unrealistically sane. In fact most women I know would behave the same way at 20, and a lot of men too.
But 12 year olds are sane - at least relative to what will be going on three years hence. If I were to criticize EY's handling of this stuff, it is that he should have followed canon by putting off dealing with romance issues until the kids are in their third or fourth Hogwarts year.
But, if EY has to drag romance into this story, I wish he wouldn't have the heads all of his minor female characters so filled with romantic mush and gossip about same that they don't seem to be much use for any other purpose. Eliezer gives his male characters a variety of idiosyncratic, yet typical young male foibles - twin Weasley pranks, Ron Weasley quiddich mania, Harry's enthusiasm for things military, even Draco's misogyny. I wouldn't mind if he teased his female characters regarding a variety of equally silly and endearing stereotypically female traits. But it seems he can only think of one..
To be honest I would have been almost as embarrassed if Hermione had done it. And probably even more bewildered..
Yes, this is why I didn't want to bring up PUA -- it drags in a host of connotations which were unrelated to my point. Which was simply that loss of dignity in front of the opposite sex is far more painful for males. The PUA-disclaimer was meant to convey that, even though I attributed the difference to the evo-psych reason I gave, I didn't want to derail the conversation with this sort of thing. Ah well....
Not as far as I know, but there definitely should be. I don't think there is any way such a study could not be interesting. There should also be some studies done on The Cheerleader Effect.
People kept emphasising that being dropped was safe, and it didn't feel like Hermione was that afraid of it, probably because the scene wasn't from her point of view. Maybe you could portray that a bit more. When Harry was dropped it was quite vivid that he was overcoming his fear.
Also it seemed obvious that Harry went out on the roof as part of a plan in order not to lose the game, and I assumed Hermione and Draco would have come to the same conclusion. So of course it wasn't a prank. So when Hermione suggested it was revenge for the date and Harry also had something against Draco, she was just joking about their unpleasant situation.
I can see I missed a few things there, but that's how it seemed on my first reading.
I noticed later they might think it would have been easier to win without Hermione having the gloves. So it could be somewhat plausible they'd think it was a prank or revenge, given that they don't know Harry's motives and may jump to conclusions.
I approve of sane apologies..
Early returns on the poll suggest that I was generalizing from one example. More people find Hermione plausible than not. Admittedly, it's a small sample, but I'm not expecting the results to reverse..
Do you remember where you saw writing that gives you this impression? I've seen PUAs talk a lot about status and fertility signals underlying relationships. I don't think that the consensus is that "there's nothing else," but I've seen some PUAs write stuff that could give that impression, such as Mystery..
If Harry had deliberately zapped Hermione to make her stumble and distract Draco, that would explain everything, but in the text he's running away, dodging their spells. He might have set some sort of trap on the roof, but there's no indication in the text.
(We read that play out ourselves.)
Have you ever been rock climbing? I assure you that the fact that you're safe, and even the fact that you know you're safe, does not shut off the (untrained) lizard brain, at least not the sort of lizard brain that's afraid of heights..
It doesn't mean anything afterwards, though, and afterwards is when the puzzling scene happens..
I only went climbing less than a dozen times, so I can’t be sure about “getting used to it”, but then again Hermione probably wasn’t used to dropping from castles.
When I climb a “simple” vertical wall I don’t get any vertigo or other “lizard-brain complaints” as I had expected. (I rarely get vertigo from heights in general, and among my friends I’m usually the guy closest to any ledge, with everyone telling me to get back, from a safe distance.)
However, I did once a climb an indoor route (not sure about terminology) that wasn’t just vertical, it had a kind of lateral transfer to a ledge at the top, and the part where I didn’t see a wall below me all the way down did feel like having butterflies in my stomach despite being tied to a rope. I liked it, but I can see it as a very unpleasant experience for a bookish (i.e., not a tom-boy) 11 years old girl.
Technicality: she's 12 by now; in fact, she's been 12 since mid-September. (Yes, I am a nerd.)
My own take on this. Hermione didn't have to go on the roof. She could've thought of a different method of taking Harry down. I forget if it has been specified, is there a time limit? They could've waited for harry to get tired walking about on the roof and picked him off later.
As such she is responsible for the risks she took going on the wall after Harry. Harry should have shown concern after her fall, but a full on apology does seem a bit thick.
And just where did this whole 'unanimously vote that Draco should drop Harry' thing come from? Why would a bunch of girls (or anyone) unanimously vote for something so boring? When you have seen someone voluntarily have himself beaten to a pulp how could it be remotely exciting to see him float down a building in controlled circumstances when a girl had already done it voluntarily without preparation? That doesn't sound remotely like the sort of things girls would suggest.
It does seem odd that in the past Harry has made sure that he doesn't moddycoddle Hermione in the battles, realising that she would be insulted if he did and yet now acts in completely the opposite manner. And Hermione and even Draco don't find it strange...
This could be a situation where nobody really likes the outcome, but (since it was obviously a very fair punishment) they all treated it with respect (wanting to signal that they liked it). So nobody suggested anything really exciting, figuring that nobody else would go along with it. (There's a name for that fallacy of decision, where everybody votes for their second choice to be nice, since they think that it's the first choice of everybody else.)
Or else, they each had a secret plan (to summon Harry to their arms)..
Am I the only one who now wants to campaign for gay rights with the slogan "Death Eaters against homophobia!"?.
They still don't enjoy the work, even if they find doing it instrumentally rational. They are forced to do it by circumstances, and in a better world they wouldn't be.
But in a world with house elves, they are even worse off - they are just unemployed, rather than having the option of taking the job. I doubt more than a trifling amount of the money saved by Hogwarts trickles down to them.
I realise that considering the effect of house elves on the job market goes far outside the scope of this problem in the philosophy of consciousness, and much far outside the scope of the Potterverse; but once you start taking into account the welfare of the hypothetical replacements for house elves, there's no real way to dodge the question.
For philosophical debates, it's probably better to stick with the pig that wants to be eaten.
I pointed out that your argument doesn't contradict Locas's statement that those who don't enjoy the work will be forced to do it, and specifically disclaimed that choosing to do the work regardless might well be rational of them (and hence making them better off). Yet in reply you elaborate in what manner this decision can be rational, as if objecting to what I said. I don't see what you disagree with (besides usage of the word "forced").
Also:
They are not unemployed, they choose the next best option available.
That.
You're right. It's still a strictly worse situation for them, though, since they lose one option and gain nothing..
Sorry, I should have used "non-artificial" or something else; I intended to also include the quoted case of house elves having been created ad hoc.
I maintain that house-elves created from scratch are completely different from identical house-elves created by modifying free elves against their will. Lumping the two together will produce non-well-defined moral judgments..
There's also Hayekian arguments-- self-aware agents are apt to accumulate information about their own desires and activities. Systems which allow that information to have an effect seem to be more capable.
Is that what you would want to want, given the option, or is that a lizard-brain instinct that gets in the way of your ability to evaluate what's really the right thing to do?
I can still interpret that either way. Do you mean that on reflection you realize that you emotionally desire that, or that on reflection you *decide" that that's what's important?
Or they could've just created self cleaning houses, so no one is forced to do work.
Needs multiply. If houses and clothes were self-cleaning and self-repairing, there would be other, high-end tasks that need taking care of, which may not be automatically fun. taking care of the lawn, cooking (for some people and for most meals is not fun).
As your mundane tasks increase due to better technology, it is useful to have someone take them over.
It is very useful to have an AI loyal to you.
Which chapter was Harry discussing the creation of house elves in?
Chaper 42.
Thanks. I do remember my eyes glazing over a bit around about then but that's a good point I missed..
Do you think it would be evil to create house elves that honestly enjoy their jobs and situations?
You could get them elegantly embroidered little dishtowels clipped into place with stylized sugar tongs made of silver.
You can't give them clothes, but no one said anything about not giving them ARMOR. Give them fine spider silk armor, it will be indistinguishable from silk.
Hogwarts elves in canon do wear something very much like that..
This is what Eliezer has already done (in the early chapters). If Eliezer switched it up and made Sirius not the traitor it would undermine two of Eliezer's morals: "Conspiracy Theories, paranoia and schizophrenia" and "Courage isn't about being too awesome to need to be scared, it's about doing stuff even when you do have reason to be scared".
In canon, it was precisely Peter's fear (greater than that of his friends) which led him to join Voldemort. So while I wouldn't like to see Sirius made into a bad guy (since I side with wrongfully convicted prisoners and don't want them to turn out to be guilty after all), it would be a powerful statement in favour of the power to overcome one's fears if Peter stayed a good guy.
It would also be a powerful lesson if Peter was able to see when his loyalty to a certain 'side' was irrational and make a considered choice to do the action that best allowed him to achieve his own goals. But that is exactly the wrong kind of signal for Eliezer to convey! ;)
That would be a Family-Unfriendly Aesop (TVTropes).
As far as the methods of decision-theoretic rationality go, whatever Peter ultimately wants is OK and not for us to judge; we just consider how he should best go about achieving his goals. But MoR is not just a lesson book in rationality, and I'm happy for works of fiction to give absolute moral lessons too (at least if I agree with them ^_^).
TvTropes!
Sorry, am I supposed to warn people? Done.
I don't know about supposed to but I like to and tend to appreciate it when others do. It reminds me to consider the tendency for humans to be whisked away into an endless depth first search of popular culture references.
This is just why I would be shocked if the 'Sirius bad' idea was reversed. The lessons the side plot has already conveyed are solid!
Funny, I've got the opposite impression -- that Eliezer was setting up to use Sirius' story as an example of how the obvious explanation is not always right and how reality is allowed to be weird and present you with evidence leading to wrong conclusions.
What puzzles me more is how Eliezer will explain the fact that Bill Weasley randomly guessed about Pettigrew and the others being animagi? That problem doesn't go away regardless of whether Sirius was the traitor or not. Did he really travel back in time? Schizophrenic wizards temporarily become seers? Maybe it's another emergent phenomenon?
I'd like to see that. Just because I really didn't like it when Bill got messed over like that.
Sometimes the world is just cruel for no reason.
I didn't mean to suggest that it was unrealistic. It is a far more likely interpretation of events and a rather clever observation. I just didn't like it. It make me sad. :)
I know. But I thought Eliezer may have been trying to make a deliberate point, and I wanted to draw it out.
Are we sure that, in MoR, they were?
That's what I assumed that the secret in Chapter 42 was, until it wasn't.
As I recall, In MoR, the Marauder's Map is an ancient artifact that's starting to break down a bit, so "Messers Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs" are not Lupin, Sirius, Peter, and James Potter under animagus-based nicknames. Unless Fred and George are wrong about the Map's origins, though being the master pranksters of the MoRniverse (and canon, for that matter) it seems likely that their judgment would be sound in this case. So, evidence that MoR!Pettigrew, et. al. are not necessarily animagi.
I interpreted it that the Messrs put their names on the front of this ancient artefact. From Chapter 25:
By the way, this reminds me that the Twins seem to have found a couple of errors on the map:
(That's why they might have shown it to Dumbledore, to get it fixed.) In canon, there are important (and only apparent) errors on the map in Book 3, showing Peter Pettigrew and Bartemius Crouch. What are they showing now?
I'm assuming that Eliezer makes major changes to canon only when it is neccessary to make the story work and that he will exploit resultant opportunities to mock canon, other fanfiction, conspiracy theories etc. but not go out of his way to create them. Yeah, that's a big assumption.
But also, there were hints. Lupin is poor so he is still a werewolf. When discussing the Weasleys' family rat story, Harry mentioned rumors that "Black deliberately tried to get a student killed during his time at Hogwarts". In canon, Black tried to trick Snape into following Lupin when the latter was about to turn during a full moon. So they knew. They still made the map (it was featured in one of the chapters, right?). Well, they didn't have to be animagi to do that, but come on, you can't take away a major aspect of their friendship and have everything else turn out exactly the same (except the teenage gay romance thing).
Indeed, there has some skepticism about this expressed in the reviews.
Agreed, I was waiting to hear about this and disappointed that it didn't come up....
Oops, I should have been more clear. By "reactionless flight is trivial" I meant in general, not necessarily for persons playing Superman. Wingardium Leviosa is a spell that generates reactionless flight, and it's literally the first thing kids learn. It can be used on persons and has already been employed in combat in MoR (e.g. "Chaotic Twist!"). Then there's other things like Quick Quotes Quills that float and move reactionlessly as they write, brooms, flying carpets, etc.. Since Hermione is a stupendous genius with spells even in Canon, and MoR!Draco is no slouch himself, it just seems likely to me that they would have tried to come up with something. Leviosa on a chair, or Hermione's shoes as a semi-permanent enchantment ("Wait, Draco, I know some 3rd Level spells..."), or something like that.
But it's nothing the Rule of Cool and the MST3K Mantra can't fix. :)
Consulting the wiki, it does state that "Snape could fly without the use of a broom or any other visible materialistic support. The only other wizard that was known to be able to do this is Lord Voldemort, who most likely taught Snape the method to do so."
Interesting. That seems to fit well enough with my theory of 'advanced generalisation of apparition-type magic' so I'll run with that hypothesis until something better or MoR!authoritative comes along.
Chapter 41 (So spoiler alert and chapter notification.)
(Fun chapter and all... go Neville! But...)
Harry is a total wuss. What on earth is he doing going about with grotesque supplication and begging for forgiveness?
There obviously isn't any need for Harry to be obnoxious about it. I would expect Hermione to consider that Harry owes him for that one. I would acknowledge a certain symbolic debt and fulfil demands for recompense (within reason) with grace and good cheer. But remorse of the kind Harry was throwing around is something that matters. Sometimes you really do screw up, and that's when you need forgiveness. Throwing out your biggest apologies when you did basically the right thing and would (if you were sane) do roughly the same thing again next time just cheapens the whole thing. Just how much does an apology mean if you go around apologising to people for, roughly speaking, wussing out and letting them beat you?
(Mind you, I'm evaluating Harry by the standards of the someone somewhat closer to the age that he acts than to the 11 years old that he technically is. With a few years of marinating in testosterone ahead there is hope for him yet.)
I don't think Harry is romantically interested in Hermione, he still thinks kissing is icky, etc.
I figured Harry gave Draco and Hermione the potion because he wanted them to triumph over him together, but in a really dramatic challenging way. If their triumph was hard-fought and dramatic they would be more likely to bond over it. Once Draco was friends with a muggleborn, he would be forever lost to the blood-purists, and Harry would have one a great victory. That is what Harry cares about the most. He obviously is willing to lose to let it happen because he engineered the Dramione alliance from the beginning.
Really? I thought those two things were entirely compatible. And rather cute. :)
Fixed for you.
It does seem to happen that way sometimes, doesn't it? But in my observation the only cases where marinating in testosterone makes people worse in the areas of grovelling, supplication, unnecessary apologies and approval seeking are in people who refuse to update based on evidence. We can assume that unlike many nerds Harry is able to make observations from the environment and use them to realise that his strategy doesn't work and go ahead and create a better model of human behaviour and a better strategy.
In guys who are good at instinctive instrumental rationality will tend to be prompted by testosterone to, as they say, 'grow a pair'. Simply because experience tells them that the other options just don't work.
First you write
Then you write
I think that you've answered your question.
And, in so doing reinforced the core thesis: Harry!Ch41 is a wuss. The overprotective thing can work, particularly when produces displays of dominance or heroism (eg. Christmas Eve dinner) but pointless supplication is the opposite of what he wants to be doing.
It totally breaks the flow of the story for me. If I am reading along empathising with the main character and he pulls stunts like this I feel a huge surge of revulsion. This is particularly the case if it seems like the behaviour is presented as a good moral that gives good results rather than "look at the naive character act like a git and then realise he needs to wise up!"
Sure, I agree with that.
But I don't agree with this:
It finally made Harry seem like a real person to me again. I like seeing how MoR!Harry (and MoR!everybody) differs from canon, but sometimes he's a little too perfect.
I expect that to happen in a later chapter. Surely EY doesn't think that Harry is acting sensibly? That would be a horror! (Unless Harry has some really devious plot that I don't anticipate, of course.)
That's just eh experience I got from chapter 36 (visiting the Grangers), my favourite chapter thus far.
I think that's the thing for me. I actually aren't so sure. Some of the other foolish things Harry has done MoR!Author seems to be trying to convey as sensible decisions. For example... the other apology Harry has made to Hermione. When Hermione had panicked and cast finate incantatem on their transfiguration work. The apology itself was reasonable but it seemed like both Harry and MoR!Author were trying to convey that casting finate was a sane thing to do. Not, for example, isolating the room and running to fetch McGonagal. Being responsible doesn't mean turning off your brain at the first sign of danger!
ETA: The latest chapter was interesting. Less nauseating but more bizarre.
Not.
H'm, you may be right. Altough it may yet be accepted that Harry was overreacting.
Anyway, it leads to a nice introduction to Remus!
(Edit: add ‘although’ in first line, which is really what I meant all along.)
The feather-fall potions were protection against a case that wasn't supposed to happen. Harry doesn't take precautions so that he's licensed to need them, he takes precautions so that people don't get hurt. Hermione falling wasn't supposed to happen -- he endangered her for the sake of a game. He raised the stakes farther than they were supposed to go, and it was someone else who could have gotten hurt.
Yes, but using feather-fall costs her Quirrell points! That's why she's upset. Or at least, that's one hypothesis that explain the facts. Harry's apology is unnecessary grovelly otherwise.
It's a great point and should get mentioned in the text. Even if it's only a minor reason for Hermione's annoyance, it would tie in nicely with the earlier scene of Hermione having trouble knocking on Quirrell's door.
Excellent. That is the desirable outcome. If enemies unite against you should sabotage their Quirrell points wherever convenient.
"So Granger, how about next time you want something from me you ask nicely for me to participate before you unite with Malfoy?"
They tried that, didn't they? All three generals went to Quirrell together to ask for no more traitors. Harry defected.
Eh, even if Quirrel points were the problem, Harry's apology is still unnecessarily grovelly.
I would go as far as to say the grovelling is worse if the Quirrell points were the problem.
Also, I don't think fire is prohibited, so did Harry warn everyone that they shouldn't try eliminating his bungee cords by burning them?
Unsurprising, and I don't see it as a problem.
Come on - Harry clearly manipulated that situation and needed to lose to make it work. Forcing Draco and Hermione to work together would not have worked nearly as well if they hadn't actually beaten them. Now Hermione doesn't think Draco is evil and irredeemable (especially since he tried to save her), and Draco was actually protecting a mudblood and then shut up and multiplied in order to win.
Wouldn't you like to know? I can think of three main categories of reasons:
There is a genuinely interesting question here. I know I personally are far less likely to take the advice of or learn lessons from wusses. I am reasonably confident I am not generalising from one example here but for your part does Harry's wussiness have any bearing on how much you expect your own behaviour to be influenced by Harry's example in the MoR parables?
This is to what I referred when I said "some arbitrary social agenda" and that I could see as many reasons to orchestrate winning as losing. Deliberately losing isn't something that I find distasteful. In fact it would be impressive, a rare instance of Harry not doing something motivated primarily by his ego. (Did I say that already? Probably. It sounds like something I would say.)
Brilliant. And that is one of the reasons (apart from excessive braid tugging) that I stopped reading the Wheel of Time series. And this is despite the fact that the very name "Wedrifid" is from the character I created on the Wheel of Time mud who spent months of real time joining the Gaidin and eventually becoming a ridiculously powerful Warder.
That was a lot of fun. All that completely useless status I acquired in an utterly irrelevant social hierarchy! I still use the name 'Wedrifid' in online forums because the Wedrifid persona is more resilient and has a personality that is better adapted to the online discussion context. The "Cameron Taylor" identity works better with, you know, actual flesh and blood people.
Do you have a binary wuss or not a wuss model? If Harry makes himself unduly subordinate to Hermione, does that eliminate the effects of him taking on Dumbledore in regards to Snape?
No, but neither is it univariate. As with many words 'wuss' means rather a lot of different things depending on the context.
Let's leave the word 'wuss' aside for the moment, to look at the implications of those scenarios has on Harry's credibility. I'll also note that subordination isn't always wussy. Grand Viziers are subordinate and far from wussy. In fact, I just got back from playing board games - something that I am extremely good at and in which I make extensive use of subordination to further my goals. Humans are heavily biased towards dominance and I find that a useful trait to exploit. No, neither subordination nor apologies are something that are intrinsically 'wussy'.
But back to the question:
Being incompetent at achieving social objectives seems like a good reason for using 'genius scheming' instead of standard methods. The fact that he does this is one of the reasons that I sympathize with him as a character.
In light of the fanfic's famed/notorious length, this presents some disturbing implications...
Haha, I was just going to post the "Harry is Rand al'Thor" theory myself. Clearly the best explanation.
Followed closely by "Harry is Richard Rahl". :)
Unlike Rand al'Thor, though, Richard Rahl would definitely hit a girl.
I'm such a wrong person, I read that as "Draco made friends with a mudblood and then went forth and multiplied in order to win".
If Harry is actually in love with Hermione, is apologizing his best move? Would he do better to show more respect for her intelligence?
Or is he apologizing for something other than setting things up so that it was likely that she'd be dropped?
The 'love' hypothesis was mostly motivated as an explanation in the case that Harry is not making his best move.
I'm pretty sure he's apologizing for a whole package of evil regardless of the dropping. I doubt Harry planned that that particular contingency would happen, and so I would also believe that he's genuinely remorseful that she actually fell.
I was bringing in Hermione's point of view as a possibly interesting part of the situation.
I'm assuming that Harry had a background plan-- to get Draco and Hermione to cooperate, and to feel as though they are on each others' side on a gut level.
Even though the "drop me" scene is cute, I'm not convinced it's plausible behavior for Draco. I bet he hasn't had the Anglo/muggle training about not hurting girls, and learning that blood purity isn't true may not have affected his reflexes.
Harry's apology may be strategic. Or he may still be learning to navigate between empathy and rationality. Or (not an attractive hypothesis) tropes may be taking over some of the story.
ETA: Perhaps that should be empathy-signaling rather than just empathy.
Er, who says Draco's grabbing Hermione because she's a girl? He's grabbing her because she's falling off the roof.
Fair point. I jumped to a conclusion.
On the other hand, it isn't dangerous for her to fall. Draco grew up in the wizarding world. I'd expect him to have a gut-level trust in the potion.
Or is Hermione showing excessive trust in the potion because it's labeled as working a certain way, while Draco has more experience with magic that doesn't quite work?

LeWatches_LeToonz on Watches for The WorldPosted: April 7, 2011.

I woke up in the morning
Stripped down my sheets
I put on my clothes, stepped into my shoes
Tumbled into the street
The daylight was shimmering
And the ghost of a breeze
Was rattling flagpoles
And whispering through the trees
That was the river
This is the sea
I went down to the station
I ran all across town
But the streets were all empty and the markets were closed
There was no-one around
I wandered like a phantom down alleys and passageways
Heavy with history
I heard nothing but silence
Silently saying to me
That was the river
This is the sea
Found myself at the highway
Trucks thundering by
Pillars and pylons
Pointing away up at the sky
Cars hissing like visions
Bikes buzzing like bees
Freight hurtling and moving
But not moving me
That was the river
This is the sea
I slipped into the cathedral
It was quiet and cool
The air was humming with incense
The windows were studded with jewels
There was a stained glass image of jesus
Shining in front of me
Haloed and bleeding, surrounded by children
And shining in front of me
And as I walked out
I was still saying that was the river
I was still saying this is the sea
I went down to the harbour
Stepped out in the rain
With a song in my head
And the blood pounding in my veins
I went down to the harbour
Fell on my knee
For at the end of all roaming
I found you in me
That was the river
This is the sea

The BCS is a joke. We need a playoff system and EVERYONE out there knows it.
It's unfair to the fans to suggest not watching a particular game but what we can do is boycott the sponsors. Don't buy Tostitos, choose a different brand of chips. For some sponsors (such as Allstate) you really can't choose to not pay your bill but you can still be heard. Please cut and paste this text, print out in stuff it in your payment envelope:
Dear BCS sponsor,
I wish to formally complain about your company's sponsorship of College Football's BCS. I would also like you to know that I will be participating in the national boycott of all consumer products and food for companies that are BCS sponsors.
The BCS is a failed system. It brings only discredit to your company and any company that associates their name with a system that disrespects the college football fan.
Please pass the word about this boycott!!!

Logger and the HitShow, and lastly, Atlantic Arts Youth Band Ensemble.
There will be a student’s art contest involving children from area schools. “Run 4 the Sea” will be a 4 mile race and also offered for the children will be 1 mile run on Friday. Beach clean-up on Sunday. This event is sponsored by FPL, McDonald’s, Palm Beach Medical Center, PGA Resort and Spa, PNC Bank, Waste Management, The Gardens Mall, Guanabanas.
For your information, Eleanor Fletcher who is also known as the “Turtle Lady” founded what is now called the Loggerhead Marinelife Center. 25 years ago she decided that educating children about the sea turtles and the need for conservation and protection was the best hope for the turtles to survive in communities that man was becoming a resident.
She began by giving classes in her home and today over 16,000 school children come to the center for field trips, outreach programs, summer camp and educational experiences. In addition, another 200,000 visitors come to the center each year.
The Loggerhead Marinelife Center is a non-profit organization that houses a variety of exhibits, live sea turtles, a veterinary hospital, exhibit hall, outdoor classrooms, and research lab and resource center. The park’s amenities included a guarded beach, nature trail, and playground and picnic pavilions.
There are several oceanfront communities that share the beach with these sacred turtles such as The Beachfront, The Oceanfront, The Waterfront, Brigadoon and 700 Ocean to name a few.

Since the first holiday tree retail lot was set up on the streets of New York City in 1851, Americans have been enjoying the tradition of a live tree to celebrate the holiday season.
Today, over 32 million trees are sold each year. This industry employs about 100,000 people and in the United States it is estimated that there are over 1 million acres in tree production. There are many different species of tree used in the holiday market. The most popular ones are eastern white pine, Fraser fir, Scotch pine and Norway spruce.
For many families, selection and purchase of a holiday tree is an annual tradition. This is usually the official start of the holiday season for many households. Proper selection of a tree will help make the season enjoyable for you and your family.
Thomas E. Walker
If you purchase your tree from a sales lot, always check your tree for freshness. This is important because the length of time since the tree was cut and the way the tree was handled can greatly influence how well it holds its needles and fragrance. onto the cut trunk end. Green needles should not drop off the tree. You will usually have a few dried inner needles that fall, but the outer ones should not be affected.
Once you have selected your tree, you should locate the tree in a safe place, preferably near a wall or corner where it is not likely to be knocked over. Keep the tree away from any heat source, such as hot air ducts, wood stoves and fireplaces.
Light cords and connections used in decorating the tree should be in good working condition. Lights should always be turned off at bedtime or when leaving for an extended period of time.
The following formula is one that many people use with their tree to keep it fresh.
Ingredients:
2 cups of Karo syrup
2 ounces liquid chlorine bleach
2 pinches Epsom salt
teaspoon Borax
1 teaspoon chelated iron
2 gallons hot water
(You can find the Karo syrup, Borax and liquid chlorine bleach at your grocery store, the Epsom salt at your drug store and the chelated iron at a garden or plant store.)
Using a bucket that will hold the 2 gallons of hot water, add the other ingredients and thoroughly mix them into the water. With a saw cut a one-inch section off the base of the tree, making it a level cut.
Immediately stand the trunk of the tree in the solution and leave it there for 24 hours. Remove the tree from the bucket, but keep the liquid in the bucket. Then place your tree into a tree stand that has a water reservoir.
Once you have located your tree in its position in your house, you can then take a cup and fill the tree stand reservoir with the liquid mixture from the bucket. Every day that your tree is standing in your house you will need to refill the reservoir.
The ingredients in this solution serve various purposes. The Karo syrup provides the sugar necessary to allow the base of the tree to take up the water. Up to 1.5 gallons of water can be taken up by the tree over a two-week period.
The Boron allows the tree to move the water and sugar out to the needles and the magnesium compounds in Epsom salts - along with the iron from the chelated iron - provides the essential components for the production of chlorophyll which keeps the tree green. The bleach prevents mold from forming in the solution.
Have a safe holiday season.

A usted. Nosotros & Vosotros.
Some of you are stocking up on caffeine fixes and 5-Hour Energy drinks before the storm hits. A storm of finals worth 60% of your grade. 12-pagers that will have you crawling into the light of the morning, turning your study guide into a white flag to wave and surrender.
You’ll make it.
I know it. I can promise that there are holiday lights that time that I didn’t know I’d ever miss. A stack of pancakes. An open laptop. Hot chocolate with whipped cream dribbling from the side. All of us laughing, not knowing at the time that yes, yes, we were going to miss it one day soon.
It’s hard to believe right now as you struggle to swallow every prefix in the dictionary or every literary term you’ll need to dissect that Emily D. poem tomorrow. But the closeness of friends in one place, the justified seeing of the sun coming up before you close a book and allow in the hired sugarplums to dance as you pass out, the 24/7 sweatpants apparel for at least two weeks… you’ll miss it when it is gone.
So pick your chin up from the computer. Stand up and stretch. Take a break to call your friend and see how studying is going. If there is someone beside you, smile… propose a coffee break… treat them.
String up holiday lights in your dorm.

In the Far Country: A Portrait of Three Generations
By Warren E. Schwartz
American Historical Society of Germans from Russia, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1984, 217 pages, softcover.
The author, Warren E. Schwartz, is a grandson of Jacob Schwartz, one of the Swiss Mennonite immigrants to the United States in 1874. Warren’s grandfather, his father and their relatives and friends are the characters in his stories.
This book is an episodic history of three generations of Swiss Mennonites who came to America from Volhynia and settled first near Freeman, South Dakota, then later in Montana.
Warren E. Schwartz writes in the Preface: "The episodes in this book are based on oral tradition. The characters, most of them deceased, were real men and women known to my grandfather and to my father, whom reminiscences provided most of the material for this work and through whose eyes most of these stories are told. The book begins in a Mennonite settlement in Russia when my grandfather, John, was a very small child. It follows his people’s migration to America in 1874 and relates their early experiences in what was then Dakota Territory. The narrative continues with my father’s boyhood in Freeman, South Dakota, and – later – in Montana, where John homesteaded in 1910."

Missy Lodge, Associate State Librarian for Library Development
State Library of Ohio
In late 2008, the State Library of Ohio was chosen to participate in the third and final round of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s (BMGF) Opportunity Online hardware grant. This two year grant provides funds that assist public libraries with upgrading and adding public computer workstations for patrons in communities that have a high concentration of poverty and also have public computers that are at risk of becoming outdated with limited capacity for users.
The BMGF, using their own process, determined which public libraries were poverty-eligible and thus met the first criteria for participating in the program. Those libraries then completed the TechAtlas technology planning tool to determine if they were “hardware vulnerable.” Those public libraries that met both criteria were invited to participate in the program. In total, 61 public library systems representing 162 public library outlets were included in the program.
In order to receive BMGF funds, public libraries had to complete three requirements: send match verification and documentation to the State Library, attend the Public Library Association’s “Turning the Page: Building Your Library Community” Advocacy Training and complete the ALA Funding and Technology Access Survey. The BMGF valued each computer at $2600; this cost covers not only the initial purchase price but also the cost to maintain a workstation for four years. For Phase I of the program, a library had a match requirement of 25% ($650) per workstation and this escalates to 50% ($1300) in Phase II. This aligns with the BMGF goal of assisting libraries with building long-term support for sustaining free public access computers in libraries.
Between October 2009 and March 2010, the State Library Board awarded $1,015,950 in BMGF Opportunity Online hardware grants to 60 Ohio public library systems. (Because of state budget cuts, one library opted out of the program prior to completing requirements.) In August 2010, these public libraries completed the TechAtlas program for a second time. This was used by the BMGF to ascertain if libraries met their Phase I requirements and was the first step toward participation in Phase II. To participate in Phase II, libraries must also complete a Phase II match verification and complete the ALA Funding and Technology Survey. The BMGF Opportunity Online hardware program is already having a huge impact in Ohio. According to the Foundation, 1 system opted in to Opportunity Online but did not complete the grant requirements, 520 workstations were granted in Year 1, and 855 workstations were purchased.
A narrative report submitted to the State Library indicated that many library systems opted to purchase all of their required workstations the first year. Grant funds were also used for peripherals such as printers and software as well as for training, maintenance and support. One librarian noted that the additional computers mean that they can serve the same number of customers in a shorter timeframe, which is essential since they have had to cut their hours. Many libraries placed moneys in a special fund for future technology needs. Librarians also indicated that the Advocacy Training proved beneficial in either levy campaigns or in seeking grants. Almost all librarians noted that there is a growth in the use of the library computers.
The BMGF Opportunity Online hardware grant became available to Ohio libraries at a very opportune time. The hardware was much needed and the advocacy training has proved invaluable. Libraries are completing their Phase II participation requirements and it is anticipated that most of the funds will be awarded at the January 2011 State Library Board meeting. Public Libraries will be asked to complete the TechAtlas program and the ALA Funding and Technology Survey in the fall of 2011 as the project concludes.

Introduction
The Brown collection of orders and decorations and the cabinets which contain them were donated by Bruce and Dorothy Brown 1995-96.
The medals represent an eclectic collection of artefacts, selected for their aesthetic and historical interest. The majority are orders and medals that were awarded for both military and diplomatic distinctions to recipients in Canada and British Empire/Commonwealth. The collection also includes orders, decorations and medals from Belgium, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Imperial Russia, Turkey, the United States and the United Nations. In some cases the Browns have been able to add, as examples, museum copies to their collection. They have also added two WWII German and a Japanese flag.
The collection represents an interesting cross-section of the symbols and emblems of the differing traditions to honour acts of dedication, courage and loyalty. It is of artistic interest in that the items are fine examples of the badge-makers' and jewellers' skill. In many cases they show a high degree of craftsmanship in working with metal and enamel. The collection is of considerable interest as an adjunct to the Special Collections military collection. The medals are historically interesting as visible tokens of certain events and persons. In many cases the story of previous ownership is known and every effort has been made to identify that ownership in the display and this inventory.
The Brown medal collection is of excellent quality-indicative of the care and trouble necessary to acquire such items, and to ensure that they are genuine. There is a minimum of wear on the medals and badges and the ribbons that support them. Because the orders and decorations are of such high interest and artistic value they are placed on permanent display in the central 12 drawers of the cabinets. The other 6 drawers will be used to introduce other items from the Browns' collection and Special Collections.
The cabinets, a gift of the Browns, were designed to provide secure storage and exhibition space for the Browns' and other gift collections. They were custom made to house this collection and were designed by Alan Oliphant of Facilities Management to specifications set by Chris Petter, Special Collections Librarian. Built by Associated Sheet Metal of Victoria with locks provided by Price's Lock and Safe Ltd., the cabinets were finished in oak by the UVic carpenter's shop. A security package was specially installed in the University Archives and Special Collections area to protect them against theft.
The display was arranged by Stuart Nicholls. The catalogue for the collection was written and researched by James Thackray, a local medal historian and collector. Overall editing and production is by Chris Petter with help from Bill Thackray. This catalogue follows the exhibit from the top of the cabinet to the bottom and from left to right. We acknowledge that this inventory may contain omissions or errors and we would be pleased to hear from anyone with comments, corrections and or improvements.

Crimean War Medal
On display: #59, breast medal with Sebastapol bar
Awarded to the British Forces in the Crimean War, March 28, 1854-March 30, 1856. Bars were awarded for the battles of Alma, Balaclava, Inkermann and Sebastapol.
Extract from Major L. L. Gordon's book, British Battles and Medals: "The whole story of the campaign reads more like comic opera than war. Lord Cardigan, for instance commanded the famous Light Brigade from his yacht Dryad lying in Balaclava Bay, on which he dined and slept every night by permission of the Commander-in-Chief. He came ashore on the morning of the 25th October , led the famous charge the length of the North Valley up to the Russian Guns, left his men there, and walked his horse back and returned to his yacht! The orders to charge were not his, so, having obeyed them, and having not the slightest use for his divisional Commander, Lord Lucan, or his Commander-in-Chief, he washed his hands of the whole affair! Subsequently, in true British fashion, he became a hero, Inspector General of Cavalry, a KCB, and Colonel of the 11th Hussars."

Sanctioned February 1, 1905 for those who took part in the Tibet Mission and to troops accompanying it, who served at or beyond Silgari between December 13, 1903-September 24, 1904.
The following is an extract from Major L. L. Gordon's book, British Battles and Medals: "In July 1903, a trade Mission, under Colonel Younghusband, was sent by the Indian Government to meet the Tibet and Chinese officials in Gyantse. This Mission met with a hostile reception on the way and when it arrived at Tanu it was advised by the Tibetan general to return to Quangtong to avoid blood-shed. This Colonel Younghusband refused but ordered the disarmament of the Tibetan troops. On 31st March, 1904, the Tibetans fired on the column and suffered heavily for doing so. On the 8th of April, the 32 Sikh Pioneers stormed the Red Idol Gorge. A force under General Macdonald refused to negotiate, so that it became obvious that the way would have to be cleared right through to Lhassa. Colonel Brander was sent from Gyantse with a force to clear the Karo Pass, which he did on 6th of May."
In July, 1904, Colonel Younghusband stated that the Mission would proceed to Lhassa to demand an apology. Preceded by General Macdonald's force, the Mission arrived on the 3rd August, and a treaty was signed in the Portala Lhassa (which is depicted on the reverse of the medal)."

Quaker has been a household brand for 130 years! They're known for their delicious, yet healthy, products that are a big hit with adults & children of all ages. We're big Quaker fans in my house – my husband is the one who rubbed his love of Oatmeal onto us so now we're hooked and it seems like we can't get enough. And now, Quaker has come out with new products that we're already addicted to – the Perfect Portions Oatmeal, Big Chewy Bars & the Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies.
The perfect portions oatmeal is perfect for us! My husband likes a lot of oatmeal, I like a moderate portion and my son likes a small portion. This helps us make as little or as much as we want.
We aren't big cookie fans here but my son is. These cookies, however, can get me to like cookies a little bit more. And they're cookies that I don't mind my son having since they're the perfect balance of chocolate chips and whole grain oats. This is the perfect snack for on the go. I love the little packs that they come in!
The Big Chewy Granola bars, ladies & gents, are what all 3 of us are fighting over! We love the regular granola bars but would go through them so easily since we would grab more than one. With the Big Chewy bars, one is more than enough – they're 60% bigger than the regular granola bar but they have the same yummy taste!
These snacks have kept us satisfied between meals. No cranky hunger pains = a happy family! We love the new Quaker products & have already stocked up on more! We highly recommend these if you're looking for a healthy substitute to your normal snacks. To learn more about Quaker products or for nutritional information, be sure to check out their website or you can connect with them on Facebook or Twitter!

(Not a human baby, of course. I wouldn't pay money for one of those. [Though I may occasionally pay someone to take one of mine away.])<br /><br />No, I bought a furry baby. A little rescue kitten. And I didn't mean to buy her. I truly didn't. I had intended to pick up my son from school and drive him directly home. But my friend <a href="" target="_blank">Lana </a>had mentioned over breakfast that the vet near my home had some rescue kittens, and a sudden, feline madness took over.<br /><br />"Can I make a quick stop?" I asked my son impulsively.<br /><br />"Okay," he said. "Do you need to go to the shops?"<br /><br />"No, not shops," I said, and parked the car. The kittens were calling to me. They were girls, I just knew it. My Princess Fancypants was inside;">Seriously - could YOU resist this face?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My son looked confused as we walked into the vet. "Mum, what are we..."<br /><br />"I hear you have rescue kittens?" I asked the receptionist.<br /><br />"NO," he said. "No! REALLY?" (My son, that is. The receptionist said "Yes!" as I knew she would. Because I could see the kittens beside the door.)<br /><br />""We have two little girls here at the moment," she said, and I looked over and there I saw my baby.<br /><br />She was tiny, and cute, with four little white socks. She had huge green eyes, and a Fancypants face.<br /><br />"Penelope!" I cried, and I still don't know why. I don't like the name Penelope; at least, I didn't before. But she was totally Penelope. It may as well have been written on her collar. (But she didn't have a collar. She was way too small.)<br /><br />So Princess Penelope Fancypants has come to live with us. And already we know quite a bit about her. She likes tuna, but definitely doesn't like chicken. She likes her bouncy ball, but thinks the toy mouse is lame. She likes her scratching post but refuses to scratch it. And if she wants to sleep under the couch all day then she's damn well going to do it and there's nothing we can do but RESPECT.<br /><br />We welcome the newest member of our family. We will serve you, Penelope, and you own us already.<br /><br />But if anyone else ever casually mentions a rescue animal, I'm going to block my ears, hum, and drive on.<br /><br />Kerri Sackville Is Going On With My Hands?The other day, rummaging in Places I Probably Shouldn't Rummage, I came across;">I am 16 and wearing pearls.</td></tr></tbody></table.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br />But all of that pales into significance next to my hands.

A flower child? A medical receptionist? A naughty, naughty girl? Or just a confused 16 year old who paired a salmon shirt with a rude gesture and still passed it off as sweet?<br /><br />Whoever I am, though, I am glad those days are over. For one thing, I don't wear polyester anymore.<br /><br />And for another thing, if I'm going to make a rude gesture, I'm going to make damn sure I know I'm doing it.Kerri Sackville Am Anxiety<b>Watch this video.</b><br /><br />If you have ever experienced anxiety, if you have ever thought you have experienced anxiety, if you have anyone in your family or circle of friends who experience anxiety, <i>watch this video.</i><br /><i><br /></i>This.

Tiny, bizarrely gravity-defying weevils who leave the sanctuary of the cereal box and crawl across my ceiling.<br /><br />Clearly, these weevils aren't particularly rational, because Blind Freddy can see that there are no cornflakes on the roof, but plenty of world leaders have been irrational.

They have invaded my home, thwarted every effort on my part* to remove them, and have partied on my ceiling (literally, not metaphorically as the Lionel Ritchie song would suggest) until I am forced to accept their victory.<br /><br />I turned to social media to bemoan my fate, because if one's life has been destroyed by vermin, the care and support of people you don't know can really help to lift your spirits. But social media is a strange beast - not quite as strange as cornflake-hunting ceiling-dwelling worms, but still - and somehow the conversation turned to moths. Hardly surprising, really, as they are closely related to weevils (in a chicken-and-egg sort of way, which I shall not attempt to deconstruct now.)<br /><br />"You should write about your fight with the pantry moths," said Lisa.

Moths in my panties.<br /><br />Years ago, when I was at school, a teacher referred to a passage from the Bible in which God sent a fly into a man's ear to send him crazy**. Since then, I have had a morbid fear of insects entering my bodily cavities, whether they make me crazy, or just give me unpleasant flutters. And aside from neurotic fantasies, I HATE the word panties.<br /><br />"Can we call them knickermoths?" I asked. Knickermoths do have a nice ring to them, reminiscent of nineteenth century undergarments that have been in a dank cellar for too long.<br /><br />"G-Moths?" my friend Annie suggested, and that was probably as good as it was going to get.<br /><br />And it was good. Because later that night, when my Weevil Master commanded me to Google Panty Moths, I got a huge surprise.<br /><br />They do exist. And you can buy them right <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />Not that I would recommend them. No-one wants moths in their panties, or in the panties of anyone else. If you know what I mean.<br /><br />But what the Weevil Master commands, I do.

It represented everything my close friends give to me, in one scene.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have a fairly sizable circle of friends, and a massive circle of acquaintances. I have friends with whom I'm laughed, with whom I've cried, with whom I've had conversations which lasted for hours, and with whom I have stayed up late exchanging texts and message which have had me weeping with hilarity.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have friends who have brought me food in a crisis, driven me here, and accompanied me there, and exchanged advice on everything from child rearing to anxiety to which bras will provide the greatest uplift and support.</div><div><br /></div><div>But there is one quality that elevates true friends above everyone else, that goes beyond the chatter and the fun.</div><div><br /></div><div>Unconditional acceptance.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's when your friends know all your shit and they love you anyway.

She talks about it often, and with tremendous pride. Apparently, the bidet gives her a new level of ‘freshness’ that toilet paper alone cannot provide – a freshness that evidently provides exceptional joy, because she was glowing just talking about it. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Well, glowing or not, I don’t want that level of ‘freshness’, or at least, I don’t want to receive it from a porcelain bowl. To me, a bidet is a malfunctioning toilet – one that flushes up, instead of flushes down. We have all had the experience of receiving a little splash back when we have flushed slightly too early, and we all know it is not pleasant. Why one would wish to give oneself a deliberate spray of water up the bum is utterly beyond me. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Of course, there is the possibility that I am traumatised by past experiences, and that I am forever prejudiced against bidets. I was once deeply scarred by a malfunctioning toilet that threw up water into my face. To make matters worse, the toilet was on a boat, and I was sea sick and desperately miserable. Since that day, I have associated spraying toilets with nausea and distress, which is as far from ‘freshness’ as one can possibly get.;">Baby Shown Not Blogger's Own<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>Still, I am aware of my bias, and I do try to be open minded, so I took the issue to Facebook.

Over something rather mundane.<br /><div><br /></div><div>For very sad reasons, I have had to part ways with my cleaner. And because I have had to part ways with my cleaner, I have had to reacquaint myself with that task known as 'cleaning one's own floor'. Now, I do lots of menial-type chores. I wipe and I wash and I scrub and I iron and I shove frankfurts in boiling water and call it 'dinner'. But I have not cleaned my own floor in a very long time. This is partly because I have been lucky enough to have a cleaner, and partly because I wouldn't know what to do with a mop if it jumped into my hands, turned on some music, and began to waltz. (Then again, most people wouldn't know what to do with a waltzing mop - I imagine they would scream and run and seek psychiatric assistance - so I don't feel too bad about that.)</div><div><br /></div><div>But three days ago, I realised that the floor was not going to clean itself, nor was I going to clean it by power of the mind alone.

Because, I discovered, there are many types of mops, and I didn't at all know which one was right for me. Did I get the mop that looked like an octopus with 37 ropes for legs? Or the one with the big yellow sponge attached to the end? Or the blue and white one that looked like a hundred chux superwipes had been shredded and attached to the end of a stick?</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, let's just say I got the wrong one. Because when I came home and mopped my floors (which was not like waltzing with a mop <i>at all</i>) they ended up all streaky and horrible and I ended up rocking in a corner on my knees. </div><div><br /></div><div>I confessed my tragedy to a girlfriend of mine, who taught me the error of my ways.

It never is. I tried to download my ringtone, but my iPhone got stroppy. “You have to upgrade to the latest iOS,” it said. Now, I don’t know what an iOS is. I’ve never given iOS’s a moment’s thought. But apparently, I had to have one, and so I set about finding">I realised that I couldn’t upgrade my iOS simply by looking at my phone in confusion (though if I could have made it happen through act of will alone I would have had such a late version of iOS the thing wouldn’t have been invented yet). </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">By a process of elimination (that looked a lot like throwing things and sweating) I deduced that I could upgrade my iOS by plugging my phone into my computer and pressing a few buttons. Easy! Except that it turned out that the upgrade took OVER TWO HOURS and if my computer lost internet connection for ONE SECOND the whole thing would fail and have to restart. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Which it did. THREE TIMES.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">By the time the thing was complete, some six hours later, I was exhausted. I was also disappointed to discover that the upgrade hadn’t actually taken effect (using ‘disappointed’ in the sense of ‘I was disappointed to learn that a meteor was hurtling towards earth and we were all going to die). By a process of elimination (that looked a lot like crying and drinking gin) I deduced that I had to start and restart my computer and phone and then plug them into each other again and wait, without breathing or moving a muscle, until the upgrade began to work. (I don’t know why the breath holding and remaining still was so vital, but it just <i>was</i>.)</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Eventually, the upgrade took place and all was well in the world. My phone looked slightly different, which mildly concerned me, but I figured that it was just the new, improved iOS - whatever the hell that was. </div><div class="MsoNormal">I felt proud of myself and in a celebratory mood. I turned on some music and prepared to dance the ‘I’m Queen of Technology’ shuffle. Except that the music didn’t come on, because somehow <i>all my music had been wiped from my phone</i>, and it was clearly <i>never, ever coming back</i>. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">By a process of elimination (that looked a lot like rocking in the corner in the foetal position) I deduced that the iTunes music was not syncing to my iPhone no matter what settings I chose or plugs I stuck in.

Anyone who has experienced it knows. Sometimes it fades into the background, sometimes it rears it's ugly head, and sometimes it roars so loudly that the best I can do is just put one foot in front of the other.<br /><br />At times like this, I turn to my last resort, the technique I use when things get really dire (and, occasionally, when things are just reasonably dire, or I'm not feeling particularly robust).<br /><br />I take one day at a time.<br /><br /.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="" /></a></div><br />Without my emotional resources, I become easily overwhelmed. Simple tasks like cooking dinner seem difficult. Bigger projects like organising my car rego or generating invoices seem scary. And long term responsibilities like my career and parenting my children seem utterly impossible.<br /><br />So I do what I need to do. I don't think about the scary or impossible. I push those thoughts away and focus myself directly on the here and now.

Anyone can get through one day.<br /><br /.<br /><br />Sometimes, that's all you can do. But if you keep getting through, hour by hour, day by day, eventually the anxiety will recede again.

This, clearly, was far easier than the assembly, which is IMPOSSIBLE and DESIGNED INTENTIONALLY TO SEND YOU HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I transported the pieces of trampoline to my parents' place, where they waited eagerly, tools in hand. (Okay, so my mother was drinking a cup of tea and my father was asleep on his bed, but they were sweetly eager in spirit.)<br /><br />The first part of the trampoline was simple to assemble, because the manufacturers are EVIL and TRYING TO TRICK YOU. My mother and I got the base up and attached part of the mat, and then things went hideously, catastrophically wrong.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br />We still failed.<br /><br /.<br /><br />I returned after half an hour, and my 11 year old daughter greeted me at the door.<br /><br />"Mummy, come see what we did!" she cried.<br /><br />I called my parents and we all proceeded to the backyard. The trampoline was fully assembled. My two children had assembled it. They had done the impossible. And they said it was "easy".<br /><br />I hate that trampoline. I do. I really do.

And I feel very lucky to have them.<br /><br />I wish that trampoline would go and spontaneously combust, though. I hate it.Kerri Sackville Good Gifts Go BadToday I bought one of my children a present. I'm not going to say which one, because I don't want any of you to spoil the surprise. I'm not going to say what it was, because I bought it on ebay, and it may not even turn up. I will say how much it cost, because it was $2.75, which struck me as ridiculously cheap considering that the postage from Hong Kong was free. You can feel safe in assuming it wasn't an iPad, or a car, but it was something very sincere, and anyway, it's the thought that counts.<br /><br />I love buying presents for my kids. I love buying presents for any of the people I really love. I get ridiculously excited about it. It doesn't matter how much the present costs or whether it is expected or not. It is wonderful to be able to bring joy to someone you care about. <br /><br />Now, that's not to say that it's better to give than to receive, because of course that is utter nonsense. I love receiving gifts. LOVE it. The problem, of course, is that I rarely get gifts I really love, unless, that is, I have chosen them myself. Occasionally someone will hit the jackpot, but so often it's just not-quite-right. You know - I've dropped hints I want a new purse, but when it arrives it's just that fraction too small; or I ask for a friend to bring back a T-shirt from the US, and when they do it's V-neck tight in the sleeves.<br /><br />But of course it's all good (I have to say that or I sound ungrateful) and I'm lucky to have people who care enough about me to buy gifts. And I'm certainly not the best gift buyer in the world. Right now I am wearing a fringed vest I bought for my friend Princess Fancy Pants* which I took back when I realised she had never worn it in her life. What's more, my children have discarded at least a third of the presents I've bought them - especially those I was truly thrilled about because they were an amazing bargain at Costco. SO;">This is nothing like the vest Princess Fancy Pants rejected. But it is still a fringed vest.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />But I'm totally sure my child is going to love their $2.75 present.

Heaving & Not.Today I was in an elevator and I heard a woman use the word 'bosoms'. I was awed. It is rare to hear a woman use the word 'bosoms' these days. Actually, I think it was probably always rare to hear the word 'bosoms'. It's theoretically possible that people would occasionally mention their own (or somebody else's) 'bosom', but I suspect no-one has ever mentioned the plural. After all, I am pretty sure that 'bosoms' has only ever been linked to the word 'heaving', and I suspect 'heaving bosoms' has only ever appeared in print. And quite frankly I can't imagine a person of any generation verbally referring to 'heaving bosoms'. How would it happen? In what;">Bosom not Blogger's Own.<br />Groin not shown.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />"<i>Oh, I saw Jillian today. My god but she has heaving bosoms</i>."<br /><br />or, "<i>Every time Max walks into the room, the women's bosoms begin heaving</i>."<br /><br />or perhaps, "<i>He has such raw sexual power. He gives me the heaving bosoms</i>."<br /><br />The woman in the elevator did not put her 'bosoms' together with the word 'heaving'. It's possible, of course, that they are inextricably linked in her mind - that bosoms heave just like cats purr or flowers bloom. But she didn't say it. She did, however, put her 'bosoms' together with a 'groin', which to me was even more startling.<br /><br />"Watch out for your bosoms and your groin," she told the young woman next to her, who nodded politely and kept holding the cardboard box.<br /><br />And I was fascinated. FASCINATED. What was going in the box? Why did the woman have to watch her bosoms and groin? What was the thing that was going in the box potentially going to do to her bosoms and groin? How was she supposed to protect said bosoms and groin from the fearsome attack of the thing-in-the-box? And why on earth was she calling them 'bosoms' and 'groin' instead of the far more colloquial 'breasts' and 'thighs', 'boobies' and 'front bottom', or even 'bazoongas' and 'vajayjay'. I mean, no-one says 'bosoms' and 'groin', unless they're some kind of weirdo 1950's doctor who is talking earnestly to a woman in a girdle and underwired bra who has strained something private.<br /><br />Unfortunately for you (and me), there is no satisfactory conclusion to this story. The woman (who, for the record, was approximately 50 years old and dressed conservatively in a white shirt and tailored black pants) stepped out of the lift with the young woman (who was dressed more jauntily in a floral skirt and pale blue blouse) and disappeared on the second floor. I have no idea what happened to them, the box, or their bosoms (heaving or not) and I suspect I never will.<br /><br />But if you have any clue, I'd be grateful to know. This mystery is going to give me heaving bosoms all bloody night.Kerri Sackville's All OkayLife is hard.

It's all okay.<br /><br />That's how it's supposed to be.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="" /></a></div>Kerri Sackville... And Forgiveness.....And Olives...I love my friend <a href="" target="_blank">Lana</a>. I do. I cherish her friendship, I cherish her unconditional support of me, and I cherish the fact that she nearly always pays for drinks when we go out. (I tried last night, I really, truly did, but she beat me to it. She's sneaky that way.)<br /><br />However, last night Lana betrayed me in a fundamental way, which left me shocked and desperate. Even now, 16 hours later, I am struggling to reconcile my love for her with her extreme disloyalty. It is hard. I hope one day I will get through this.<br /><br /.<br /><br />I didn't notice anything was wrong. I thought that we were as close as ever. We went back to school and I collected my kids, and chatted and laughed with some of the other parents. All was fine. Or at least I thought;">(mouth shown not author's own)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />But then I got in my car, and looked in the rear view mirror. And I saw it. As clear as daylight, only black, which is not at all like daylight, but rather like night - very, very black night.<br /><br />A big piece of olive stuck between my two top teeth.<br /><br />I was devastated. And horrified. Because Lana, my dear, dear friend Lana, had not informed me that I had olive between my teeth.<br /><br />I felt sad. I felt betrayed. I felt hurt. And then I sent her a message asking how she could have done such a thing.<br /><br />"Sorry," she replied. "I was trying to <a href="" target="_blank">find your ears</a>."<br /><br />And just like that, I forgave her.<br /><br /><br />Kerri Sackville In A Turban, Or "Hurtie Ears"It is rather unseemly to complain about pain that one inflicts upon oneself. It's probably not reasonable to expect sympathy when one has undergone a purely elective procedure for something as minor as an ear.<br /><br />But I am not complaining about my pain, nor am I asking for sympathy. I am simply outlining, for those of you interested, what it feels like to become a character from Star Wars.<br /><br />As many of you know, I underwent surgery on Monday to correct my one-and-a-half sticky-out ears. (Obviously, I have two ears, and both were operated on, but only one was very sticky-out. The other was moderately sticky-out, but it's easier to achieve symmetry if they do both.)<br /><br />I suffered from an affliction known colloquially as 'bat ear', or, in medical terms, as 'bat ear'. (Yep, sometimes Latin just doesn't cut it.). The ridge of my ear was lacking a crease, causing it to stick out at a 90 degree angle instead of lying flat against my head.<br /><br />The operation, known as 'otoplasty', involved creating a crease. The surgeon made an incision in the back of each ear, scored the ridge of each ear with a special instrument (as opposed to, say, a spoon), inserted permanent stiches to hold the ears in place, and then dissolving stiches to re-connect the skin.<br /><br />He then slapped a massive piece of gauze on each ear, wrapped a bandage the size of a turban around my head, fastened it with approximately twelve metres of surgical tape, and sent me on my way.<br /><br />In the long term, the result will be two beautiful flat ears.<br /><br />In the short term, the result is two hurtie ears, a new taste for pain medication, and a rather startling resemblance to Princess Le have never before noticed the similarity</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The surgeon reassured me that the pain wouldn't be too bad, and that I could probably make do with just paracetamol. And I totally could, provided that I washed it down with a couple of Digesics, a nice strong sleeping pill, and a slug or two of gin.<br /><br />The sensations themselves have varied from day to day. The first night it felt as though my earlobes had been sliced off, and two red-hot pokers inserted in my earholes. The second day my entire ears ached, and it pained me to open my mouth. The third day, the pain localised to the site of the incision, and the bandage began to feel very heavy. The fourth day, the ache began to subside, bar the occasional shooting pain in various locations throughout my aural region. Today, day five, I am frantically itchy, and quite desperate to remove the massive turban.<br /><br />Last night I felt a mild panic attack arise, as the claustrophobia of the bandage began to overwhelm me. I had wild fantasies of attacking the turban with a pair of (safety) scissors, ripping it off dramatically, and scratching my new ears. Perhaps, I began wondering in fear, there weren't even ears under there at all, but two transplanted fingers attached to each side of my head. Perhaps the surgeon had removed my ears and put them back on backwards, as a joke. Or perhaps he'd tattooed them with purple spots and bejazzled them with sequins, just to lift my spirits.<br /><br />I still don't know. The bandages come off on Monday and all will be revealed. Until then, I am trying desperately not to scratch, and to breathe through the crazed desire to return from planet Star Wars.<br /><br />Thank you all for your support, and my ears and I will see you soon. Or at least hear you soon.<br /><br />From a much flatter distance.<br /><br />Hooray!Kerri Sackville I'm Doing It....<br />As some of you will know, in recent times <a href="" target="_blank">I have been contemplating my sticky-out ear</a>. Actually, I've been contemplating my sticky-out ear forever. It is something that has bothered me for as long as I can remember. It bugs me when I look in the mirror. It bothers me when it pokes out from under my hair in photos. And it drives me crazy in strong wind when I fear I might actually take off and fly (but in circles, because only one of my ears sticks out, so I have no chance of going in a straight line).<br /><div><br /></div><div>And now, I have finally decided to do something about it. I am forty-four. It is now or never. And I want to know what life feels like without a crazy ear. I want to know what it feels like to be able to wear my hair back without looking like a lopsided Minnie Mouse. Most importantly, I guess, I want to like my ears.</div><div><br /></div><div>Since writing my previous post and talking to friends, I've been amazed at the support for my decision - at least from women. "If it bothers you and you can fix it, then do it!" they say. Several friends have admitted to having their own minor procedures done. I had no idea how many of my friends have had nose jobs, Botox, teeth capping, and their own bat ears corrected.<br /><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="251" src="" width="320" /></a></div><br />Men, interestingly enough, don't seem to understand. "Your ears have never bothered me," said my husband. "I've never even noticed your big ear," said a male friend. But then I've always maintained that men see the entire picture - face, body, boobs, four limbs - whereas we women are all about detail. </div><div><br /></div><div>Only one female friend of mine questioned my decision (and yes, hon, I'm talking about you). "The whole quest for perfection bothers me," she said. "I love imperfections in people. I love your ear."<br /><br /></div><div>But I'm not trying to be perfect. I'm far from perfect. If I'd wanted to be perfect then I'd be fixing a lot more than my ear. I'd be getting the veins on my legs stripped. I'd be getting a boob job. A tummy tuck. A face lift. That special fraxel laser treatment on my skin to remove all the pigmentation. And Japanese ionic straightening to permanently correct my crazy frizzy hair.<br /><br /></div><div>But I don't want any of that. I don't want to be perfect. I just want to have a nice normal ear. So I'm going in tomorrow for a day procedure and I'm saying goodbye to my sticky-out ear forever. It's a strange feeling. But bizarrely exciting.<br /><br />So thank you for your support in anticipation. Photos shall come soon. And my ear and I shall see you on the other side. </div>Kerri Sackville Is No ExcuseI don't get outraged a lot these days. The older I get, the more aware I am of my own flaws and limitations, and the less I judge other people. What's more, as the years go by, the more attuned I am to the dark side of the human condition, and the less surprised I am by some of the shocking things that occur.<br /><br />But the Chrissie Swan saga outrages me. <i>Not </i>because the woman had a sneaky cigarette whilst pregnant. I mean, seriously people - do we not have more important things to worry about? She didn't beat one of her already-born children, or take to her pregnant stomach with an iron bar. She didn't mainline heroin or strap a dozen mobile phones to her stomach to send radiation to her poor helpless fetus. She didn't even smoke a pack a day. She had a few sneaky cigarettes. I mean,<i> give me a break</i>.<br /><br />And yet the woman is required to offer a tearful apology to the entire nation because of her bad behaviour. It is outrageous. It is none of our business. NONE. It has nothing to do with you and nothing to do with me. Chrissie Swan is a 'personality'. She has made her living through media work - television, radio and newsprint. And good on her. That is <i>incredibly </i>hard to do and she has risen above the pack and succeeded. I admire her and I envy her.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="'s-day-logo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="82" src="'s-day-logo.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />But the fact that she has made her living through media work does not make her public property. Chrissie Swan is not Kyle Sandilands. I have listened to her radio show many times and read her columns and watched her on TV. She is respectful of other people, self-deprecating and warm. She does not deserve or invite public shredding.<br /><br />As for Woman's Day, well, they ought to be ashamed of themselves. They won't be, of course, because they are a tabloid publication, and celebrate women by mocking their weight gain, pointing out their plastic surgery, speculating on their eating disorders, and celebrating their personal tragedies. Of course they're going to publish photos of yet another 'fallen' celebrity, however ridiculously fabricated the 'fall'.<br /><br />I just wish they weren't pretending to believe they were doing a community service by highlighting the dangers of smoking whilst pregnant, because that is cruelly and laughably disingenuous. We <i>all </i>know the dangers of smoking whilst pregnant. They did it because they knew it would sell a lot of magazines, at the expense of a decent human being. And there is no excuse.<br /><br />Sometimes, these days, I still get outraged.Kerri Sackville Sing The iTunes ElectricA few years ago, I lost my mobile phone. I can't remember where (no doubt if I did, I would have found it). To make matters worse, my laptop had recently died, and I hadn't backed up my iPhone on my new computer. My entire iTunes collection was wiped out. <br /><br />Over the years, I built up a new collection, slowly. As I remembered the songs I'd downloaded from the net, I would add them to my playlist, but I knew that most of them were lost forever. And it hurt. Those songs were a part of me. They evoked a myriad of feelings, a thousand memories from my life. There were songs that made me cry every single time I heard them. There were songs that made me get up and dance. Songs that made me energised. And the sexiest song I'd ever heard. <br /><br />Sadly, I couldn't remember what that one was.<br /><br />And then last week, something miraculous occurred. I used my brain. I realised that there simply had to be a system for identifying and re-retrieving songs one had downloaded from iTunes. And, lo and behold, there was. It was time consuming and cumbersome, but it could be done.<br /><br />So I did it.<br /><br />My entire, previously wiped playlist magically appeared before me, and I retrieved the songs, one by one. It was incredibly exciting - like uncovering lost-lost photos, or love letters, or childhood diaries. I rushed through the download and began playing my tunes. I was in heaven.<br /><br />There was <em>I Sing The Body Electric</em>, from the movie Fame - a song that gives me goosebumps every single time. <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="" width="420"></iframe><br /><br />There was <em>Shout and Deliver</em> by The Reels, which takes me back to 1981, a daggy Year 8 girl with frizzy hair and too-thick eyebrows. <em>US Forces</em> by Midnight Oil, which reminds me of an old school friend. <em>Pass The Duchie</em>, which is as close as I ever came to drugs in my youth. <em>Pressure</em>, by Billy Joel, which never fails to get me up and moving. <br /><br />There was Goodbye Yellow Brick Road by Elton John, which makes me pensive. Michael Nyman's piano score for <em>The Piano</em>, which makes me weep. And Teardrop, by Massive Attack, a song my sister famously pointed out and cried "Look, how cute! She has a cool song in her collection by mistake!"<br /><br />Oh, and the sexiest song in the entire world? Well, I'll leave that up to you. But let me tell you, I'm playing it right now....Kerri Sackville baby was almost late to her first ever day at school because I couldn't get my mascara right. I don't usually wear mascara, but my eyes looked like I'd been crying all night (which was not surprising, because I had). And so I slathered it on, then got teary again, so the whole lot smeared. In the end, I left the house with grey-rimmed puffy eyes, which will look truly memorable in those First Day At School photos.<br /><br />I didn't expect to have such a strong reaction to my youngest starting school. I was quite excited when my big boy and girl started Year K all those years ago. I was ridiculously proud, marveling at their uniforms, taking endless photos of them with their hats and bags. It felt like the start of a wonderful new chapter. There was no sense of loss, no sense of mourning, just fresh beginnings.<br /><br />This time, though, this time it's my baby. My beautiful, precious girl. She was born when her siblings were already six and eight. Last year her brother started high school, and next year her sister will join him. They are growing up, moving forward with their lives. Every day I see them morphing from children into teenagers. Every day I am stunned by the passage of time. It rushes ahead, and they rush with it. It's magnificent and wonderful and incredibly quick.<br /><br />But it's been okay, because I have had my youngest. The big kids could grow up but she would always be with me. She would always be cute. She would always want to snuggle. It would be okay because I would always have my baby. I couldn't even fathom my girl growing up.<br /><br />Today my baby put on her uniform and shoes, hoisted her backpack onto her back, and walked into school. And it hurt. It <i>hurt</i>. I didn't want to let her go. I was careful to be positive and cheerful, but inside I was crying. I know it will be fine, I know she will have a fabulous day, but I'm just not ready to let her go.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="" /></a></div>Time, it goes so fast. And kids grow up. Even your babies. Even the ones you think will stay young forever.<br /><br />In years to come, I'll look back on the pictures from today and laugh. There is my daughter, in her too-big dress and her perfect, shiny shoes. There is my husband, smiling broadly. There is our big girl, having run down from her classroom, proudly showing her sister around. And there is me, with my grey puffy eyes, clinging on to my baby with all I've got.<br /><br />One day I'll laugh. But right now I'm still having a little weep. Until 3pm, when I pick her up, and she'll be my little girl again.<br /><br />Kerri Sackville IS It With Men & Hair?The other day I got my hair cut. It's not a big deal. I didn't get a buzz cut, or a mohawk, or - god forbid - a mullet. I got a fairly standard, chin length, concave bob; you know, shorter in the back, slightly longer in the front. My hair is curly so it bounces up. But it's not that short, and it wasn't that drastic a cut, and at the end of the day it's just hair.<br /><br />So why did my husband freak out so much?<br /><br />Okay, he didn't exactly 'freak out'. He didn't cry or throw things or rent his clothes or tear his hair or run of the house screaming 'WHY, KERRI?</a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">If my husband had his way.....</td></tr></tbody></table><br />But he did look horrified.<br /><br />"I hate it," he said to me. "I hate it!"<br /><br />I shrugged. "I really like it," I told him. "And there's nothing I can do now, anyway."<br /><br />"Grow it!" he pleaded, despairingly. "I want you to grow it back! Now!"<br /><br />My husband is 46 years old and has a masters degree. I hadn't anticipated his faulty grasp of the laws of biology and physics, but it's always interesting to learn new things about your partner.<br /><br />"You do know hair doesn't grow six inches overnight?" I asked him.<br /><br />"I can't look at you," he cried. "I'm not going to look at you till it grows back!"<br /><br />"Okay!" I said. I poked him in the chest. He looked at me. I giggled.<br /><br />Since getting my hair cut I've discovered that many men seem overly invested in their partner's tresses. They become distressed or unsettled if she cuts her hair significantly, with the level of upset proportionate to the number of inches trimmed. It's like a Rapunzel complex, only without the eternal youth, and I have to wonder what it's all about.<br /><br />Perhaps men subconsciously link their own masculinity to the length of their partner's locks. Or perhaps some primal instant links long hair with fertility and the ability to skin and cook a woolly mammoth. Or perhaps they just like to see hair on the pillow that's not theirs. I DON'T KNOW.<br /><br />All I know is that I love my new hair. And my husband seems to be getting used to it. Or at least, he's stopped talking about how little hair I have. Which is good. Very good. Because once we're on that topic, let me just say....Kerri Sackville Want Schnitzels? Go Pound Yourself.<br /><div class="MsoNormal">My*. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">So every now and then, I will buy a mountain of chicken, and a huge pile of veal, and fry up enough schnitzels to last the year.

I pounded and pounded until the kids became alarmed and my husband appeared before me.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">“What are you doing?” he asked warily, looking as anxious as if I was wielding a mallet in my hands, which, of course, I was.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">“I’m making you <i>schnitzels</i>,” I yelled. “And you’ve <i>forgotten about the bath</i>!”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">“I just ran it,” he said carefully. “Um... I think the chicken is ready.”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I looked down. The piece of chicken was in tatters. There would be no schnitzel for this particular bit of bird. There wasn’t even enough left for a nugget.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal".</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">It took one and a half hours.

Though I went to a co-ed school, and saw boys in their natural habitat, I never saw them alone, never saw the way they interacted together when there were no girls present. <i>What do they talk about</i>? I used to wonder. <i>How do they play</i>?<br /><br />Well, now I have a thirteen year old son who often has group of friends over. And so now I have access to the secret world of the male.<br /><br />At this very moment I am eavesdropping on my son and seven of his friends.

I have been feeling more and more boundless during my times of prayer. When I close my eyes and sink deeper and deeper into it, I can begin to sense that the idea of my body as my boundary is contrived. That my true self is without limits. Like I said, I’m no ordinary squirrel.
I remember when I was about nine that I had a life-changing moment driving past the lake in the passenger seat of my mom’s car. Looking out the window I suddenly realized in my gut that I was completely singular, completely alone in my experience. I remember looking at mom and, with no small sense of amazement, realized that she and I were two different people and our experience of the world would never fully converge. I would never know what her eyes saw as she looked at the same road I was looking at, or how the seat beneath her felt on her legs, or what thought was filling her mind from one moment to the next. It felt very isolating, yet somehow inspiring. There was suddenly a feeling of importance for my life, but also great alone-ness.
Whether or not it is related to that early event, for most of my life I have been operating under an unexamined belief that we are all separate. Why wouldn’t I think that? Don’t most people think that? Doesn’t it look like that? I am me and you are you. I am one and you are one. Here we are:
Even as I’ve come to know more about God, even as I’ve experienced inexplicable connections with a few very special people, even as I have done some reading up on metaphysics and theories of transpersonal connection, my grander experience of life has never really changed. So why would my overall paradigm change?
But now, something new is dawning. The other night, as I was feeling boundless, I said, “Thank you for the way you move through all things.” With those words my paradigm changed. Suddenly there is a ONE. If my Self is boundless, then your Self is boundless. And his…and hers… Where do you begin and I end? Where does my spirit or consciousness or energy cease to inform yours and vice versa? Where does yellow end and green begin?
I’m telling you, I am walking down the streets of Los Angeles the past few days passing people and thinking, “Do you know that we are actually colliding right now?? That you are made up of divinity just like the rest of us? How cool is that!?” This doesn’t mean I have to trust every person, that I have to welcome their energy into my experience, but I do think it is a part of the Love that I have asked to learn more about.
As for separateness, I think we are separate as sensory processors and as egos. My little nine year-old self was right about that. But senses and egos are not all we are.
********************
A final reminder—for you and for me—that this blog was started with the idea that we are like waves. Remember that you can not point to where your wave ends and another’s begins. Nor can you can point to where your wave begins and the ocean ends. It is a metaphor I like…and now I like it even more. Hope you do too.

Frying fish isn't that difficult to do, but it's also easy to screw up if you're not paying attention, so the folks at America's Test Kitchen have a few simple tips to help you get perfectly cooked, perfectly browned fish in no time. The trick? Start with a little sugar.
The video above actually shows you the results, and we'll reiterate what they say: don't worry, you won't taste the sugar at all. Sprinkle just a little sugar on one side of the fish—that's the side you'll sear first. Sear it on one side, and turn it over, and then toss the whole pan, fish and all, into a 425 degree oven so the other side gets some color and the fish cooks evenly. I like to call this the "sear and blast" method, and use a similar technique (sans sugar, of course) for steaks and chops.
If you're curious about why this works, the sucrose in the sugar will break down into fructose on the surface of the fish at about 200 degrees Fahrenheit. That's much lower than the traditional temperature required for the Maillard reaction (approx 309 °F), or that reaction that makes seared everything so delicious. The sugar gives you the color and the flavor at lower temperatures. Plus, this way you don't have to fry your fish forever or smoke out your kitchen with that fishy smell no one loves.

The short answer to that, for me, is not well…at first.
In fact, ‘not well’ is a gross understatement. Depending on the particulars of the setback, on one end of the spectrum, I may get angry and loud or on the other end, I may get positively hysterical, screaming and crying and pounding my fist on the closest hard surface, be it a table or someone’s noggin.
The latter was a recent reaction to losing an entire manuscript just as I was about to begin editing. Doesn’t matter how it happened, but my reaction was over the top, just a little. (I pounded my desk and not Hubby’s head, by the way.)
Naturally, all I could think about was how much time, blood, sweat and tears went into that story. How would I ever retrieve the whole of it from my less than stellar memory? Did I even have any more blood, sweat and tears to shed? And time? Well, I had beta readers and a pro editor waiting on me. The rest of the day is a blur of padding around the house with my head down, staring into space, while alternately indulging in fits of sobbing.
My mood had brightened by the time I woke the next morning. Oh I was still reeling from the shock of it all, but I could see clearly now what I had to do.
There was only one thing I could allow myself to do…begin again.
On the path to your own dreams and goals, all sorts of obstacles can block the path. The small stones that can litter the path are easy to kick out of your way. Then, there is the monstrous boulder. When it falls onto your path, you need some help moving an obstacle of that size.
In my case, I had my Hubs, kids and a few friends telling me “Things happen for a reason” and “The book will be better than before”.
Yes, it might be better. Or, it might not.
And that’s the rub.
Whatever you choose to believe is what you can expect to happen.
A covey of dark angels swoop down on you and ask questions like:
“Are you sure you want to do this all over again?”
“Wouldn’t you rather sit back, binge on chocolate and read all day?”
“You don’t really think a second book can possibly be better than your first masterpiece, do you?”
“Hahahaha! Sucker! This was meant to be. Don’t waste your time rewriting!”
Yes, my dark angels really did say all those things. But not immediately.
At first, I was pumped up to write my “better” story. I knew I could accomplish it in a matter of a few weeks, too! My fingers flew over the keys…the first 3 days!
They waited for my weakest moment. The moment my burst of excitement, drive and confidence wore thin. I was easy prey.
The most evil dark angel appeared with all of his needling and prodding to get me to quit. I could have listened. I was certainly tempted. I even took time to think it through.
“Should I drop this book? Maybe losing it was a sign that I shouldn’t be writing it.”
An image of myself ‘walking down the street, shoulders hunched forward, tattered clothes, messy hair, carrying a bottle of gin’ flashed in front of my mind’s eye…that would be me as a quitter.
I’M NO QUITTER!
So I got right back to writing my story. My fingers aren’t flying as fast and I’ll need to replot the majority of the book but, it’s a fabulous feeling.
When you have a setback – when a big ol’boulder jumps in your way – take another path or find a way to scoot around that boulder and continue on your way to reach your goals.
Whatever you do, don’t listen to those dark angels partying on your shoulder.
DON’T QUIT. READJUST, INSTEAD.
You may have reacted differently that I in a similar situation.
Care to share your reaction to a setback in goals or plans?

The dim heart of the Regency Theater swirls with energy as over one hundred mountain bikers greet each other in anticipation. The food and beer lines stretch along the back wall. Mountain bikers oogle raffle prizes including day-passes from Highland Mountain Bike Park, bike care-kits from Pedros, Two Fox suspension forks, CrossMax wheel-sets from Mavic and Back Bay Bicycles, and the Grand Prize, a Kona Tanuki mountain bike.
This is the New England Mountain Bike Association (NEMBA) Mountain Bike Film Festival and the anticipation isn’t just for the Red Bones BBQ or the beer donated by Harpoon Brewery–or even the prizes–it’s for the films. While screenings of big name films happen all over the country, this is one of the few that celebrate the making of mountain bike films at the amateur level. These are videos made by mountain bikers about their own rides and adventures.
Soon, the lights go dark and the films begin to tick off one by one. They are all short (rules require under 5 minutes, but most are under 3.) They all have limited production quality. They each shake, wobble and tilt in vertiginous ways. But what these films lack in production, they more than make up for in passion. As I watch beginner XC riders skitter through singletrack turns and freeriders send-it off dirt kickers, I realize that picking one to be the “People’s Choice” was going to be a contentious event.
Mike Feeney produced a couple of hard-charging freeride videos that not only included hucking decent-sized jumps and ripping scary ladder bridges at Highland MBP, but also rednecks jumping ATVs and starting a snowmobile on fire. “Badassalon 2008″ and “I Didn’t Pump My Tire” head up the humorous entries with pellet rifles and a remake of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” Marsha MacEachern’s “A Biker’s Playground” is a surprisingly emotional romp through the woods (and a lake.)
I am surprised to see an animated feature, but Bryan McFarland put one together with some chill music. There is also an iPhone entry that has some of the best composed visuals in the festival. Two high school kids put together a strong contender for the People’s Choice award filming their mountain biking class riding homemade stunts. It is “One Speed Jasper” that barely edges out the other films for People’s Choice, however. This film used the GoPro HD camera famous for helmet-cam shots in so many adventure movies. Of course, the camera ended up attached to the usual places on the bike: helmet, rider’s chest and seatpost. What really made this film shine was that the subject wasn’t just the ride, but also the faithful mountain bike companion: the “trail dog.” In the true GoPro fashion of showing things from “your point of view,” the camera was attached to Jasper the Dog for a trail-dog’s-eye-view of a run through the woods chasing a bike.
THIS is what makes amateur film shine. The footage shook like “Blair Witch Project” but it focused on a valuable part of mountain biking that often gets overlooked by the large production films.
After watching Highland Mountain Bike Park’s GnarEast film winner, a good film that centered around the central “story” of the park and ride bus that shuttles riders in to Highland from surrounding towns, they announced the raffle winners.
Not everyone left with a Kona mountain bike or set of Mavics, but, I think it’s fair to say, we all left with a greater appreciation for mountain biking, whether it’s the camaraderie of riders gathering in the dead of winter, the glimpse into where video will be taking us in the future or the passion for riding that made these films happen.
Winnick Woods Trail Day Video
Here is the film from the footage I shot during the Winnick Woods trail day.
If you look at the dates of the trail day, you’ll see that it’s been a while since the work got done. I got the final shots of the completed work being ridden just a couple of days ago. Enjoy!
Trail Day pt 2: IMBA Trail Care Crew
It’s not every day that you get to work with the preeminent experts in your field. Greater Portland NEMBAgot that opportunity when they won a grant to bring the IMBA Trail Care Crew to Falmouth to teach a trail building clinic. Thirty people showed up for the workshop that included both in-class instruction and field work at the new Falmouth open land project. Chris and Leslie Kehmeier of the IMBA Trail Care Crew (East) spent the morning teaching us about “flow” of both water off the trail and of mountain bikers gliding along singletrack. After spraying a heavy coat of bug spray on ourselves, we picked up our Pulaskis, McLeods and rakes and and began the outdoor clinic. With their help and instruction, we turned 1800 ft of nothing but little pink flags into fresh, sustainable trail. There is still plenty of work to keep us busy out there, but with their technical, hands-on teaching, we have a good start on a great trail. Thank you, Chris and Leslie, and IMBA.

Trail Work Day Pt 1: Winnick Woods
There.
Raging in Portland
Mountain biking, for me, is a solo event. So I feel some apprehension when I ride into the parking lot to see a dozen cars parked with bikes on top. Normally I blame my work schedule for my lack of riding partners, but that’s only partly true. My thirst for alone-time derails any real attempt at finding people to ride with.
Tonight, however, I’m heading out with the Rage on Portland group, a loose organization of riders who consistently meet up to ride. I do these rides once or twice a year. As I begin talking to the Ragers getting their bikes ready for the trail, I remember why. There is a subdued energy surrounding these people. They love trails. They love riding them. And they love riding them together.
We set out and I drop in mid pack. I represent the center-point in this group of twenty-five–somewhere between the hammers and the cruisers, somewhere between the twenty-ish woman on her ninth ride ever and a sixty-five-year-old man who’d been riding since before I was born.
There is a lot of chatting on the road. Then, we drop into the dense Maine woods. Sound disappears. Our tires roll over dry dirt and pine needles. The occasional rustle of dry leaves breaks the silence. The line of riders weaves like a multi-colored serpent through the forest. It’s like a dance where my personal experience gets swallowed up in the greater experience of the group. The line bunches up as we slow to say hi to a hiker with a border collie and thank her for letting us pass. once past, the line stretches until I can’t see either end.
The banter picks up when we stop at trail junctions to wait for the rest of the group. While I’ve met most of these guys before, I don’t know any of them well enough to engage in the ribbing that goes on. Instead, I take it all in, learning about the people I’m with. Brian spends a lot of time crashing. Mike is riding strong after fracturing his hip in a crash the summer before and Katrina could kick all of our asses on a bike or climbing a rock face. There are riders who just got back from Moab and riders dreaming of making the trip to Kingdom Trails a couple of hours away. Even though I know nothing of their off-the-bike lives, I feel like I know them all. And they seem to know me–the important parts, at least.
Maybe the bike is the only thing that unites us. I doubt it, but it doesn’t seem to matter. We set off again, pedaling into the woods. The only real competition amongst us is with the sun racing toward sunset. I follow the leaders, trying to memorize where the new trails are so when I come out here again, by myself, I can find them. The task is impossible in the labyrinth of trees. It doesn’t matter, I tell myself. I promise myself this is the year I put away my loner tendencies and begin riding with the group.
Mourning Trail Closures in Montana
A precedent-setting decision by made by U.S. District Judge Donald W. Molloy condemns 150 miles of trail in the heart of Montana to closure and threatens over 700 more miles of singletrack throughout the state. The trail closures stem from a lawsuit filed by the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, Montana Wilderness Association and The Wilderness Society alleging that, by allowing mountain bikers to use the trails, the Gallatin National Forest Service failed to preserve the wilderness character of the Hyalite-Porcupine-Buffalo Horn wilderness study area (WSA). This ruling sets the stage for possible closures of trails in other WSAs around the state (and the greater US).
This loss is personal for me. The Hyalite trail system was the solas I fled to during one of the lowest points of my life. I often headed out after work. Since I was on a mountain bike, I covered the distance to overlooks in the short hours before sunset that would have taken far too long on foot. I have many fond memories of watching the slanting rays of the sun light up raw peaks and tree-carpeted valleys in crisp alpenglow. Being in the center of all that beauty gave me the strength to wake up and go through it all again the next day.
The Gallatin Forest Service office’s mountain bike-friendly policies make the trails surrounding Bozeman easily the best trails I have ever ridden. They built sustainable trails long before “sustainable trail-building” became a buzzword. Their trails consistently show less wear and less erosion than other trail systems around the US and should be a model for trail-building. Instead, it makes them an easy target for lawsuits.
The IMBA and Montana Mountain Bike Alliance have vowed to continue the fight through appeals. Here are a few things you can do to help:
- Become an IMBA member.
- Make a donation to IMBA’s Legal Advocacy Fund.
- Donate to the Montana Mountain Bike Alliance.
- Be cool, and politely share the trail with other users.
Remember, this fight will soon extend into your own neighborhood trail system. Joining your local trail advocacy group is essential. The opposition is organized, we must be, too.
Here are some links to articles on the trail closures:

Summer the way summer was meant to be lived
We have had a most peculiar summer, with the weather either overly cool and rainy (today) or blazingly hot (temps near 100 predicted for Sunday). I long for a stretch of 82 degree, low humidity days, but I wonder where it is that I think I live. Minnesota doesn't do moderate, not summer, not winter.
On Tuesday, I took a rare day off work--a rare day that wasn't committed to book nonsense, that is--and met up with dear, dear, dear PMiller, famous on this blog, famous in life, a best friend, an old friend. She knows all my secrets and she does not judge me. She is wise and thoughtful but also loves to laugh and hike and doesn't mind the rain or bugs.
She came by my house in mid-morning, won the hearts of the dogs all over again, and then we cruelly left them behind and drove down the Mississippi River to Frontenac State Park for a hike. Now if you've been reading the news, you know that the state government here in Minnesota has shut down. The state museums and historical sites are all closed. You cannot buy a fishing license, or renew your driver's license. Beer distributors are finding out that once their licenses expire they cannot renew them, and so Miller has to pull all of its products off the shelves of all liquor stores. The Minnesota Historical Society has shut down its library, and the Minnesota Historical Society Press might not be able to publish its fall line of books if this goes on much longer. It is madness, all of it.
The state parks, too, are closed. This means you can't park in them, there are no employees, you are not allowed to camp, all the buildings (including bathrooms) are locked, and if you fall off a cliff there will be no ranger around to rescue you. But you can hike. The trails are open. So hike we did.
Pam grew up down near Frontenac; this is her territory, like the North Shore is mine. And it is gorgeous. Sandstone bluffs high along the river; eagles and turkey vultures wheeling on currents of air; prairie grasses and wildflowers grown tall, swaying in the gentle breeze.
It was not a ridiculous weather day. It was chilly and we had spotty rain in the morning, but the skies cleared and we got freckled and a little sunburned in the afternoon. We had the park to ourselves--us, and the animals.
As we rounded one grassy path, I saw movement up ahead, a dozen or so small brown birds with long necks. "What are those birds?" I asked, and then the mother--a turkey!--hurried out of the tall grass behind them. She made a noise, and the baby turkeys all flew, almost straight up, and hid in the leaves of a spreading birch tree. Mama turkey crossed the path, plunged back into the grass, and was gone.
What magic! A dozen wild baby turkeys. But there was more. Pam spotted a fox (I missed it). We both stopped and watched, through brush and grass, as a speckled fawn nursed from its mother, who watched us with big eyes and did not move.
We walked and walked. We saw an immature bald eagle at the top of a tree, all hooked beak and mottled feathers, and a mature eagle gliding and soaring nearby. Pam insisted on calling them "the mother eagle and her baby," but that was one big baby, with sharp-looking talons.
We stopped for a picnic; Pam always packs a feast, and so we had fresh berries and cherries, two kinds of cheese, crusty peasant bread, two ripe tomatoes, an apple. We ate so well we forgot to eat the chocolate she had packed.
Later in the day, we drove down the Mississippi, crossed over into Nelson, Wisconsin, got ice cream (me) and wine (Pam), sat outside, had a mid-afternoon coffee, meandered back to the park for one more walk.
We were never at a loss for words. We solved all the problems of the world that day, as my grandfather would say--we reminisced about our youth; we talked about her grown son and the job market; we wondered how much money we will need to retire (that one we didn't solve); we talked about romance and relationships and friendships and all the people at work who drive us around the bend and all the people at work we respect and admire. (I will leave it to you to decide which is the larger group.)
And then home again, along the empty road, through the quiet farmland and pretty river towns, back to the Cities.

Ziptrip: North Side Siblings Develop a New Type of CTA App
Leave your old CTA smartphone app in the dust, because these siblings are focused on making Chicago's commute simpler, and help with the No. 11 bus cancellation.
Forget the consistently wrong bus schedules and the need to be a seasoned Chicagoan to figure out all the public transportation tricks, because two North Sie siblings have created a tool to make navigating the city a bit more – visual.
Shayna Hirsch, 28, and her brother Robert, 31, of Lake View, have spent the last year and a half developing ziptrip, a new smartphone application aimed at smoothing out the sometimes wonky commutes with the Chicago Transit Authority.
Unlike current apps with seemingly endless lists of bus stops or a constant need to refresh the app to update the data, the Hirsches created an interactive map that recognizes where the commuter is standing in the city and plots out all the area bus stops.
“There are probably a dozen or so CTA apps out there now, most of which are terrible. Well, no, they’re all terrible,” laughed Robert, a graphic designer who created ziptrip’s look. “They’re all exactly the same, and nobody likes using them. So we thought, ‘There’s got to be a better way to do this.’”
"We use ziptrip every day, and moving forward with 11 going away, (finding alternative routes) is just something we’re going to have to think about.”
Robert said he and his sister Shayna would commute on the CTA every day for work, becoming increasingly frustrated with each app they tried out. Eventually they realized the solution they were looking for didn’t exist, so they created their own.
With unique features like the visual map pinpointing buses in real time, as well as reminder settings so commuters can get an alert when their bus is five or 10 minutes away, the Hirsches think their app is simply more useful. And so far, ziptrip users agree. The app currently has a five-star rating in the iTunes apps store, and the duo says they’ve gotten a few hundred downloads since its launch six months ago.
However, the two – who also live together – have another motive behind perfecting the app. Shayna says they personally rely on the soon-to-be-cancelled No. 11 bus, so they’ll be using their own app to discover new ways to make their daily commute downtown.
“The 11 bus is going away,” Shayna said. “We live at Lincoln and Wellington, and we’re so pissed off about it… We use ziptrip every day, and moving forward with 11 going away, (finding alternative routes) is just something we’re going to have to think about.”
Sign up for breaking news alerts in Lincoln Square and check us out on Facebook.
Once the buses are cancelled, ziptrip will be automatically updated to not include any discontinued routes.
In the meantime, the two are listening closely to the reaction from users. And with the CTA reporting more than 1.6 million riders every weekday, the Hirsches are hoping to hear even more.
“The crazy part is that in the last three months, we’ve tripled our downloads and monthly users,” Robert said. “We’re kind of impressed at this point. People are truly liking it a lot.”
Ziptrip sells at the Apple iTunes store for 99 cents.

Well said United Future's Judy Turner. I couldn't even be bothered blogging about this silly bunch of meddlers, the National Council of Women. But Judy Turner has given them and the 180 degree party (National) a good burst.
“So a report written by the National Council of Women will tell the United Nations that New Zealand is experiencing ‘marked change for the worse’ for women,” she says.
“What a load of hogwash. This is simply representatives of the women’s industry trying to justify their roles and push for more funding. They argue that sexist jokes are increasingly common, and more needs to be done.
“National had a ‘PC eradicator’ two years ago. Now they are chasing the women’s vote and proposing that the taxpayer fork out to increase the funding given to the Ministry of Women’s Affairs to expand their role and mandate.
“I have to say when you look around the world at countries where women are sold and traded like commodities; and rape victims are murdered by their own family in the name of ‘honour’, it’s a little embarrassing that we have a delegation heading to New York to say that sexism is an increasing problem in New Zealand and sexist jokes are common place.”

National is a load of crap for caving in on their principles. Most women have a great sense of justice and don't want to look like victims or be teated more equal than men under the law. Who now speaks for them?
Sorry to blog of topic but on Newstalk ZB on Wednesday about 2-3pm a guy rang up saying he had 5 kids and was on about $700 pw and he's recently shacked up with a woman with 4 kids on $600pw and he was going to get a job but had now made the economic decision not to go back to work.
Unfortunately their recordings failed on that day but I'm trying to get a transcript. I'm sure its just the tip of the iecberg. Are the figures for income distributions of beneficiaries available (without names of course) through the official info act?
would creat a hell of a stir.
WFF has meant families with many children can be better off not working. There can be no doubt that the scheme will effect productivity sooner or later.
Of course if this newly formed couple declare their relationship to WINZ their current incomes will be reduced. I think the big story is the one we can't know about and that is the incidence of 'illegal' shacking up/ claiming two benefits. Since a Court ruling defining what exactly is "in the nature of a marriage" (after which WINZ had to overturn thousands of cases which had previously been deemed as such but no longer were, dis-establishing debts, paying out lump sums)I don't think they vigorously pursue relationship fraud. Too hard to prove the positive.
It's getting harder to elicit info through the OIA (from MSD anyway) but some questions could be framed.
Hey, how do you tell there's been a blond at the computer?
... Twink on the monitor.
(Do I get stoned by the WFF now?)

Being a guy, I know that if you are the hands on type (like me) we tend to define ourselves by the tools that we have. I am going to discuss which tools I think no man should ever go without because of their versatility to work on almost any job. The tools below are any man’s dream to have in his arsenal. Being in the construction business for over the last 30 years, we take our tools and their ability to perform on the job as serious business. With the large variety of power tools on the market it can be mindboggling, but these tools allow us to work faster and increase the number of different jobs that we are able to accomplish. Below, we are going to discuss power tools that will make a difference in performance and reduce fatigue.
Makita BDF452HW 18-Volt Compact Lithium-Ion Cordless 1/2-Inch Driver-Drill Kit
Cordless Drill
No man should ever go without a cordless drill in his collection. This will be your go to tool for many projects around your home. Without it, you’ll be looking like an Amish carpenter as you hand-bore holes at a rate of one per hour. The Makita 18-volt cordless drill-driver weighs only 3.5 lbs. yet delivers up to 450 lbs. of max torque. This little beauty will give you enough oomph to get through any type of reasonable material. Its ergonomic shape fits like a glove for reduced operator fatigue and has a compact lithium-ion battery charges in only 15 minutes for less downtime.
Hitachi C10FCH2 10″ Miter Saw with Laser
Miter Saw
A power miter saw, also known as a chop saw or drop saw, is a power tool used to make a quick, accurate crosscuts. Common uses include framing operations, cutting crown molding, chair rails or decking. Most miter saws are relatively small and portable, with common blade sizes ranging from eight to twelve inches. Hitachi’s 10” miter saw is great for a couple of reasons. It is the lightest in its class at 26.5 lbs. and also has an exclusive laser marking system which can be activated before the blade is in motion for exact alignment and predictable blade placement aiding you in achieving the old adage “measure twice, cut once”. I would recommend saving money and building your own more versatile miter saw table. Building your own will allow you to support longer stocks, frees up works space and keeps the saw at the perfect working height all the time. There are many plans and videos on the internet you can access for building your own table.
Milwaukee 6509-22 Sawzall 11-Amp Reciprocating Saw
Sawzall
Few tools embody the raw destructive force of a sawzall or reciprocating saw. It will cut through most metals and woods like butter. It has a large blade that resembles a jigsaw. Milwaukee makes a sawzall that is the ultimate demolition tool. This bad boy can be equipped to cut pretty much anything with its dizzying array of available blades. Studs, pipes or even sheets of metal don’t stand a chance against this awesome machine. This sawzall is an 11 amp durable and super light machine weighing in at just 7lbs holding the title for the best power-to-weight ratio in its class. Don’t underestimate this small, but really tough, saw that has variable speed trigger that sends the blade from 0-2,800 strokes per minute. It has a rubber boot that provides superior gripping and exceptional accuracy.
Paslode 902000 16 Gauge Straight Finish Nailer
Finish Nailer
A finish nailer is a specific power tool that is categorized as a type of nail gun. The finish nailer is designed to accomplish carpentry finish work quickly and efficiently. As with other types of nail guns, a finish nailer is designed for use with very specific sized nails, which are sold in strips that load into the gun. Inside, a hammer mechanism drives the nails with powered force, making the finish nailer ideal for quickly installing all types of trim from baseboards to crown molding. Paslode’s 902000 Fuel-Powered Cordless 16-Gauge Straight Finish Nailer allows you to never worry about dragging around cords,. It weighs just 4.9 pounds, so it’s easy on the arms. And with a sure-grip handle, it’s comfortable to hold, even during all-day jobs. It can drive 3/4″ to 2-1/2″ 16-gauge straight nails in even the hardest woods, so you can finish doors, molding, paneling, rails, casing and cabinetry work. When you’re tackling a big job, you’ll be grateful for the high-capacity straight-collation magazine, which holds up to 100 nails.
DEWALT DC825KA 1/4″ (6.4mm) 18V Cordless XRP™ Impact Driver Kit
Impact Driver
An impact driver is an ideal choice for tackling a broad range of fastening applications. It is getting a lot of attention these days because it is neither a hammer drill nor a regular drill. It has a smaller condensed profile compared to a regular drill allowing it to have 1,330 inch-pounds of torque. This also means that you are less likely to strip screws and it allows you to drive long screws with minimal effort. This Dewalt driver has a textured anti-slip grip comfort grip that provides maximum comfort and control when on the job. It also has a heavy-duty impacting mechanism that directs the torque to fastener without kickbacks. You can’t go wrong with this machine.
DEWALT DW366 7.25″ Heavy Duty Circular Saw with Electric Brake
Circular Saw
This type of hand held power saw is a basic tool in a carpenter, builder or home renovator’s tool kit. A circular saw is an electric saw that turns a round flat blade to cut wood, metal, or plastic depending on the blade selected. A good circular saw should have enough raw power to slice through everything from wet lumber to dense hardwood without bogging down. For a wide range of carpentry projects, the good old circular saw can be your best friend. Choosing one like the Dewalt DW364 is a good call, in that it has both the power you’ll definitely need and the features you’ll be thankful for, particularly if you get into making some more advanced cuts. The saw is capable of making bevel cuts of up to 50 degrees and its aluminum alloy base means enough durability to make a lot of said cuts. For safety’s sake, this saw is equipped with an electric brake for quick blade halts and features a handle layout that keeps you behind the blade.
Porter-Cable 342 1/4-Sheet Palm Sander
Palm Sander
A palm sander is a type of power sander that can easily be held and operated with one hand. It is often a good choice for a variety of home improvement tasks. The palm sander works by vibrating in a slightly circular pattern. This motion causes a very effective sanding action to occur, smoothing the surface of the wood being sanded. They are considered very versatile and can handle both finish sanding and rough sanding jobs. The Porter-Cable Palm Sander is nice because it has a 2.4 amp motor for power and durability, rubber grip for comfort, a porous polyethylene dust canister that is much more durable than its cloth counterparts and weighs a mere 5lbs..

I feel like I've given this Lunduke fellow too much credit.
A challenge? really?
Let me point out a few things:
-.
If you want to make some points, why don't you write them on your lame blog. Then, if I feel so inclined, I'll write some stuff on my lame blog. We will make it impossible for our readers to follow. Isn't that how you freetards do it?
2373 flames:«Oldest ‹Older 1 – 200 of 2373 Newer› Newest»
EPIC WIN!
Yeah because if you gave up your anonymity, you couldn't be such a Drepper.
The hater is a reasonable guy. He really is. Well played! You pwoned him thoroughly.
You must be either deIcaza or Shuttleworth.
If so - Mark, when are you stopping this "Ubuntu" nonsense? I'm sure you can do something more productive with all that time and money, like creating school administration tools, or adopting a child, or doing lots of coke and whores.
LH - you may actually like Linus and want it to success, but most of us shudder the thought of actually using that steaming pile of shit.
Linux. Is. For. Nobody.
Please, let it die.
I like Linus and want it to success too
'coz he's a chubby chaser.
I meant Linux, you marvelous faggot gaylord!
It's obvious to anyone who has read this blog for more than a month that LH is Linus after a night of heavy drinking.
Linux - suck different!
Is it possible to use Linux, but *not* be a freetard?
I don't try to annoy other folks, just because I use Linux on the desktop. I enjoy tinkering with computers. I also use Windows, when I need it. I think it's fun to learn new things, new OS's.
Does that make me a "freetard" as you guys put it? I hope not.
Linux slogan competition?
Linux - it's dead, Jim.
Linux - install once, uninstall once.
Linux - you will have to live forever.
Linux - awful software for dirty people.
Linux - better when you're high.
Linux - the can't do attitude.
Linux - game over man, game over.
Linux - you meant it as a joke.axee.
"Learning new OS" is almost a meaningless thing.
Installing software, troubleshooting, superficial UI differences, are not really a "Learning" experience. There's no deep underlying principle. If you really want to learn about computers, grab a theory book.
The implementation is mutable, and in the end, unimportant.
You use Linux as a toy, which is all it can ever be (and quite a stupid, broken, boring and ultimately futile toy). As long as you don't try to deploy it in any real world scenario, or try to convert anyone, it's OK. Sad, but okay.
@rockwell
Does that make me a "freetard" as you guys put it? I hope not.
No, you are not a freetard. A freetard is someone who goes on and on rambling and promising about freedom and fundamental superiority of foss without delivering.
mmmmh, I wouldn't say that LH pwnd Mr. Lunduke (no need for that, somehow), but he demonstrated he's a honest and reasonable guy. And *a lot* of style.
...is Linus after a night of heavy drinking.No, otherwise he would post only on friday, saturday and sometimes on wednesday... :P
If you find yourself saying things like Micro-dollar-oft (Micro$oft) then you're a Freetard.
haha. Chicken.
I want to see the debate--I think it'd be an awesome attention-hungry cat fight.
Sounds like good times all around.
@ rockwell
What the guy said about studying theory is absolutely true in everything. Even though it's nice to play with many different things, at some point the best time investment is to go at the root of things, not forever, but long enough that at the end one is able to separate the main concepts from the implementations.
And this way is also time saving: from one concept you basically can know the root of tons of implementation. If you take the other way around, you need to try *many* implementations before understanding the main point.
That said, you surely are not a freetard.
Ah, saw too late, sorry Rockwell, if you want an example, Jake T seems to be a good half freetard (and surely he'll say something about his courage to put his real name etc.) :P
I'll add a few
Linux - Get What You Expect (and expect nothing)
Linux - Because Freedom means spending your days hacking someone else's code
Linux - Being a Tool is Better than being a Paid-by-M$-shill
Linux - Alpha Software? That Means #1 Baby!
Linux - The OS of Tomorrow! (in 6 months)
The question?
Copying Open Office documents to USBkey
Linux - Finally got it to the way you want? Well, time to apt-get dist-upgrade!
Ok ... so, i guess what I'm hearing is that (most of) you guys don't have an issue with using Linux on the desktop ...but a "freetard" is one who constantly tells everyone else that desktop Linux is superior.
For what it's worth, I don't think that's the case .. but I do think Linux on the desktop has come a long way since I first messed with RedHat, back in 1999 or so.
For most users, though, I'd say Windows is still the better choice, or Mac OS X. Me, I like the idea of another choice, so it's fun to investigate.
sorry, above post was from me -- rockwell
Got it, rockwell :)
evangelism and religious zeal over software just gives us all so much to laugh about
This post somehow got modded "Funny">>what are the chances of Word replacing LaTeX as the editor of choice in academia?
Hate to break it to you, but it already has, like 10 or 15 years ago. It is only some very zealous math people who still use TeX for anything important, and only even more zealous Linux or BSD users that do so on open source operating systems. In the last 10 years, closed source software has leapfrogged open source in every conceivable way. Windows 7 and OS X make Linux look like the crap that it is. Office 2010 puts POWER into the hands of both everyday users and power users like nothing else in history.
Admit it folks, open source software has failed miserably. Closed source has demonstrated, once and for all, that there is no real benefit to opening up software.
I await my downward moderation simply for telling the truth.
Oh, I also forgot about "paranoid", rockwell. Your average freetard is more paranoid than a stereotypical Kentucky mountain man.
@ Rockwell:
I like the idea of another choice, so it's fun to investigate.Fine, me too (and many other here) like the idea of another choice, but still Linux is not at all a suitable option for my needs. And I tried a lot.
I tried so much that at some point (realizing that I had to compile alsa for idiot reasons) I stopped and googled "Linux sucks", really full of hate! Then I found a forum and from there this blog.
It has been an enlighting moment to discover that it wasn't my fault, that there are precise, detailed reasons for the suckness and that I wasn't alone.
If it works for you, I'm actually happy for you.
If it doesn't, well, it's quite possible that the reason is very well explained in one of the posts of this blog (that's why I like it).
best.
P.S. How did you end up here?
Lundyke can now join Tony "Force My Wife" Lawrence and Steven J. "Zomg Confickerrr Will Striek at Any Moment" Vaughan-Nichols in the Hall of Freetards.
Lundouche? Someone had to say it!
LH you are a fag indeed, I don't hide myself and I face Winchot users every time, and here in Argentina that's all the time. You are not hiding because you are affraid of freetards, it's because you feel ashamed of the CRAP you say in your blog.

Alvarez is a teenage prostitute from Argentina who sucks cock as a value-added, free service.
So ... this, then is a freetard:
//Alvarez said...
LH you are a fag indeed, I don't hide myself and I face Winchot ...

So, if i just communicate entirely opposite of what Alvarez does, I should be ok. Yes?

Yup, he's a freetard.

You get a hard-on using the command line?
IShowing a screenshot with one command. Wow. That is up there with bragging about turning your linux desktop into a cube or a fish tank. As if using cntrl-alt-printscreen + paste into email take 5 hours.
What exactly do you use Bash for that makes your life easier? What couldn't be done with Cygwin?
Linux fish tank for those who haven't seen it
So, it has come down to this... the most outstanding advantage of Linux over Windows is the ability to share a screenshot over the network with one line of command on the console.
Yo, what the hell is this "winchot" business? Sounds like a rifle or something.
Yes, most new freetards are like Alvarez: 16 year old boys who have bought into the lies and zealotry spread by older men such as Stallman. It's the software version of NAMBLA.
Excuse me, that's GNU/NAMBLA.
I love how the community sees itself as "intelligent" when really its "arrogant".
Using a command line does not make you smarter. That would be like a crane operator claiming to be "far more intelligent" than you simply because he knows how to work a complex piece of machinery.
@Alvarez.
Did you read at least one post of this blog? What the fuck are you trying to demonstrate? What do you want to say? Is this the freedom you are learning in FLOSS? Do you want attention? Do you understand that, if this fucking Linux stuff would work better it would be a great platform for many more people? Do you understand that it doesn't because of internal problems?Do you understand that not everybody is a programmer? And that among programmers not everybody is interested in FLOSS? And that among FOSS programmers not everybody is interested in RMS stuff? And that the same applies in general for life? And that that's exactly like in the nice fractal wallpapers that you make?
BTW, they are really cool. And you know, they are not good because of GIMP, they are cool because of the fact you did them and you did them well.
BTW, You can do the same in every platform. But remember that many people CANNOT do what they want under Linux. But almost everybody can do what they want in Windows and partly under Mac. Why? Because Linux sucks in many things for many people.
Relax. And, if you feel, answer.

The Linux elder and the convert.
A play by .net jerkface.
Elder: Switch to linux and you'll never have to deal with windows problems again. You'll never have to deal with windows malware. All the cool smart kids are using it. It's really fast. I love it. You'll love it. You'll never have to buy windows again.
Convert: It's free and really fast? Well ok I'll try it.
Elder: Great welcome to the club.
Convert: Thanks.

Convert: Where can I buy Linux games?
Elder: There are lots of free Linux games like Quake 3 and Tux Racer.
Convert: Yea but not many new ones.
Elder: That's because game companies don't want linux to be successful. Just buy a console.
Convert: Like the xbox?
Elder: ARGH! Haven't I taught you anything? That would just mean more money for Microsoft.
Convert: The point of linux is to keep money from going to Microsoft?
Elder: In some ways yes. So buy a PS3 or a Wii.

Elder: (loses control) FUCK. Did you know that my uncle had some software that didn't work in vista? So I guess windoze sometimes breaks software too.
Convert: That was an OS change. I never had windows update take away my sound.
Elder: Well Windoze is just as bad. I mean come one. Blue screen of death and everything. Yea. And Vista Sux. So there. Just wait a few months for the patch. Or buy a new laptop. Make sure you buy one that isn't from an evil manufacturer.
Convert: Umm..sure...thanks for the advice....Linux sure is neat and stuff (reaches for restore cd).
Using Linux isn't some superior intellectual exercise. It's actually quite easy.
The problem start when you have to troubleshoot Linux, or actually get work done. That's, as well, isn't Hard (with a capital H), it's simply tedious, or impossible.
Obscurity isn't cleverness.
Cumbersome isn't complex.
Knowing of tons of obscure, mostly useless details of operating a fringe operation system does not make you intelligent, it's just junk knowledge, since that knowledge changes on each release, and does not converge into a whole.
At most, mastering Linux makes you an IT helpdesk, or a wannabe sysAdmin.
Linux - running in circles is the way forward.
Linux - facts are subjective.
Linux - trivia is intelligence.
Linux - Hitting your head against the wall is fun.
Linux - futility is inevitable.
The play is funny because it's true. Let us not forget the We've lost an Ubuntu convert to an iPod Touch thread on UbuntuForums, the bastion of brainwashed teen Lintards.
And I guess that's the way the elder reacted after he reached for the restore CD
@"Copying Open Office documents to USBkey"
Linux Desktop seems to do strange things to external USB flash devices. I remember trying to copy MP4 videos from Ubuntu 8.10 to my PSP device, suddenly giving me errors about folder permissions WTF???? Fat32? I had to mess around and schmod 777 the folders and files on my USB flash drive to get it to work properly.
Anyways I'm done with Linux desktop. Some people say "it's come a long way", I say PooPoo. It only recently supported wireless cards with WPA, and works almost barely. And don't even talk to me about WPA SSID with spaces in them. Most distros BORK with those. And what does "come a long way" mean? Is there now a single stable desktop/sound/video/LSB standard? besides firefox, openoffice evolution, and gimp, what groundbreaking application was made? Where is DVD video and DVD menu creation program? Why is there no gnome equivalent of Krita? No better equivalent to Dia? (gnome draw doesn't count), BD support? Send to context menus?
I'm sorry but running windows apps in wine is not the solution I'm looking for. If that's the only case, why bother to switch?
Goodbye Linux, hello OSX, BSD, Win7, Solaris, ReactOS. At least those have standards which don't change drastically every 6 months.
Let us not forget the We've lost an Ubuntu convert to an iPod Touch thread on UbuntuForums, the bastion of brainwashed teen Lintards.Good lord that thread shows everything that is wrong with the linux cult. Instead of just putting the poor girl back on xp, they actually suggested:
1. Don't use the ipod, buy a different mp3 player.
2. Run itunes in a virtual machine. You don't need Windows. Wait I guess you do, but instead of simply inserting the restore cd you should setup a virtual machine.
3. Dual boot xp and ubuntu. Want to run itunes? Time to restart you computer! Yay Linux is fun.
I love how the community sees itself as "intelligent" when really its "arrogant".
Dial that arrogance to hubris and you get an inability to see the forest from the trees when discussing the future and potential new sources of computing systems. Their blind "Linux is superior in every way" and "everything Microsoft does is garbage" attitude has not only blinded them to deficiencies in their system and strengths in Microsoft's, it has also blinded them to the erosion of both marketshare and mindshare in traditional and emerging markets.
Sure, servers remain strong, but Linux is out of aging UNIX setups to displace. Even then Solaris and FreeBSD and seem to be gaining interest, especially with off-the-shelf projects such as pfSense, Monowall, and FreeNAS. Linux has no presence whatsoever in the small device markets held by the likes of iPhone, iPod, Windows Mobile, PSP, and Game Boy. The rapid fire failures of Linux in these ventures does not leave one optimistic to the future, either.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying DesktopIsDead(TM), but part of the competitive advantage of being the small guy is that you can maneuver faster than the big guys. When the big guys can come in and corner an emerging market faster than you can even recognize that it happened (e.g. netbooks), it means that there is no competitive advantage. Linux being unable to capture risky, unstable markets at the rate Microsoft, Apple, Sony, and Nintendo do means that Linux is slower and less efficient than the big boys that they openly mock.
Were Linux a traditional business, the recommendation would be "compete or die". Some vendors, like RedHat and Zimbra, seem to already see the writing on the wall. As others have stated, it's all over if interest drops among the aging corps of hardcore hackers drafted between the late 80s and late 90s, which encompasses the overwhelming bulk of effort. The RMSes, ESRs, Perenses, and Torvaldses that were so plentiful fifteen years ago have dried up. Linux is on borrowed time unless it markets itself in a way to capture the hearts of young visionaries.
1. Don't use the ipod, buy a different mp3 player.

From the Ubuntu forum:, maybe you should have done what needed to be done in the first place.
The person wasn't a "convert", you just installed it on her computer and called it a day. Then when stuff she wants doesn't work, what's the first thing that happens? That's right, she wants what works back.
What you should have done was clean and recondition the copy of Windows like any non-fanboy would do.
This is more proof that Ubuntu (and Linux in general)is not ready for desktop use.
I say:
Make Windows her main desktop again, leave anti-virus off and teach her safe computing.Here's another funny freetard:
Have had a similar issue here. My younger son used Kubuntu for six months until he went to 6th form college. He then decided he wanted XP back so he was "fully compatible" with the college. Couldn't argue there.
Then six weeks ago he finally got fed up with always having to check for viruses, mallware etc, and asked for Kubuntu to be put back on.
Then he went and got an iTouch!!!!
I don't get fed up with always having to check for viruses malware, etc. I just don't run random programs on my computer. Strange concept!
Run software for an Apple product on a Windows virtual machine on Linux
Rube Goldberg would have loved this...
Linux - it's good enough for you too, dammit! you just have to try harder!
For people who tend to get malware the easiest solution is to make them use vista in a limited account. There is also the question of what exactly are they doing that leads them to get malware when most computer novices I know are able to keep their computers clean. The only exception was a friend who didn't want to pay a measly $20 for GTAIII and downloaded a warez version. His computer was turned into a battleground for competing malware. Needless to say he learned his lesson.
I have heard it is common at places like geek squad for people to bring in computers filled with malware and blame it on the teenagers who were looking for porn. Always the teenagers of course.
But Linux as a solution to malware? Reminds me of people who propose the public bus as an alternative to the car. Sure it works for some individuals but will it meet the demands of a typical American family? Give me a break., this is why I've stopped trying to convert people. The truth is that a lot of folks stay with Windows primarily because they are dependent on Windows-only software/hardware or because they're afraid of the unknown.
Being pushed by a Linux zealot into conversion away from Windows gives them the perfect excuse to blame you for anything that goes wrong. If they had a problem in Windows, it would be "Stupid computers." Once they have a problem in Linux, you can be sure it'll be "Stupid Linux. I want Windows back."
In order for people to successfully move away from Windows to Linux, they have to want to do so. I'm more than happy to help anyone I know who wants to make the switch... but given how many people I know who have to use iTunes for their iPod Touches or iPhones, I don't see that happening any time soon.Hardware and software? Computer being used for more than just the operating system? People actually using their computer for software to do stuff? Weird.

Yeah, but it won't be Freetards who come up with the "something better". Freetards have tried, tried and FAILED at that.
Lamedude wasn't even entertaining in his reply. What a disappointment.
Anyone else find it hypocritical that these guys espouse freedom, First Amendment, and all that, but when it comes to poking fun at the sheep in wolf's clothing that is Linux they're all, "What is your name?! Where do you live?! What is your job?! We demand this info, coward!"

It's so funny to read those threads on Ubuntuforums where a "Hi, I'm new to Ubuntu" post comes in begging for information on how to play DVDs or use WiFi or do video editing and no one gives the real answer: "go back to Windows".
LOL @ "Man up and debate me via video conference". The nerd clearly has thrown down the gauntlet ..er.. mouse.
Completely hypocrital. But only point Lunduke didn't answer is:

FUCK LINUX

OMG,an admirer of Lunduke started his blog to tell everybody why linux sucks.
you know what it means, IMO? That in few months there will be a lot of "ILoveLinuxButItSucksALittle(TM) blogs, that then will be used to shut up even more real criticism by answering "You see, our good community is able to criticize, and we LOVE it".
It will be cool to criticize Linux in this useless way.
Of course things won't change. For sure.
What needs to be done is zealot style trolling ("Linux does NOT suck, you are just too dumb to use it", etc.) on these posts that are starting to crop up. In fact...let me get started.
Oh yes, Windows it's so open even though just about every security firm on the planet is now saying its more secure than OS X and even Ubuntu. Security and safety are two different things.
Linux - Relive the early 90's every day
Don't listen to the experts. It's 1997 and you can insta-pwn any Windows machine with WinNuke.
But Linux as a solution to malware? Reminds me of people who propose the public bus as an alternative to the car. Sure it works for some individuals but will it meet the demands of a typical American family? Give me a break.
Linux isn't the people who suggest the bus instead of a car. Linux is the guy in the corner who bikes to work. And not the friendly guy who does it for exercise, oh no. Linux is the flaming prick who walks around in the padded shorts and lectures people about big oil. And he never quite gets that you can't put $200 in groceries in the handlebar basket, and having to carry people around on the handlebars would get old.
Ok, after the apt-get upgrade ... I was able to boot back into an older kernel ... thank goodness. At least wifi is back.
Still, that's whacked. How would a "average joe" know what to do.
Hmm ...
What is the story behind "winchot"? What's the insult? Does the -chot mean something? Does it rhyme with some other word? What?
As far as the average user is concerned kernels are what you use to make popcorn.

"Windows Genuine Advantage - In case you forgot you don't own what you bought."

Point conceded, though, WGA chafes a nerve, along with the even more paranoid anti-piracy stuff in Vista and beyond (yes my software is 100% legal).
The counter argument is that MS is entitled to receive their due from anyone using their software. This measure would not be necessary if there were fewer freeloaders - I remember people selling burnt CDs of Win98 and Office07 in the Buy&Sell way back (and I got my ads yanked when I tried selling Linux CDs to make a few lousy dollars).
No one has a perfect system. But, as is stated every now and then, this place is a haven for Desktop Linux "hate". There's plenty of crap about Microsoft flung around out there already for anyone to read. Some is true, and a great lot of it is tired old BS and FUD, which is exactly what this place gets accused of.
For myself, it's more for the laughs. No one on the net is going to change my views anyway. I've suffered system breakage with Linux (including today after updating a fresh server), so that's not BS, and I somehow manage to keep my home desktop running months without a reboot or GPF, years without a virus or reinstall, and never have had an update pooch something, except once on a grotty old win2k server, and recovery was an F8 - Use Last Known Good Configuration away

At least it didn't break X. Try installing the latest drivers from nVidia and do a simple kernel update. Et voilà, xorg.conf totally fucked up!
Oh, and xorg recovery in Ubuntu always failed with me, someone else here got it right? I remember doing dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg after every kernel upgrade, and then reinstalling nVidia drivers each time.
Windows users raving about Linux users, I don't know who is more sad.. the armwaving freetards or the Windows mob here unable to look beyond their shitty desktop systems
This blog rocks! I just spent 6 hours hacking together a working Suckbuntu 9.WTF. Ya see, I'm smart, I have two partitions, one has the broken new shit and one has stable 8.10.

From Lunduke's reply:
How about a debate on how the format of your blog is either helpful or harmful to the Linux (and software in general) world?
I guess it helps, but only a little. No one can help Linux unless he has the power to do fundamental organizational changes to Linux development, something like major Linux vendors join force to develop for a single distro.

Linux OS is like a poor fake Apple Ipod touch clone. You know, the ones they sell for 70 bucks on the street corner?
linuxitouchclone=looks similar but shoddy made, poor interface and bad integration with components, can only do a few functions that are builtin (calulator/notepad), practically no third party games or apps. Don't mess or alter code or end up with breakage (just like desktop linux)
real ipod touch/phone=totally rocks, everything tightly integrated and makes sense, easy to control gui, wifi built-in, can download and run TONS of cool applications, games, productivity/special software. Worth every dollar as new software keeps popping daily and large catalog of cool software.

I`ve read all of your posts and I believe you have the right attitude towards the epic shitstain that is linux.

Poor "linux hater" -- surrounded by retards!
Linux, FOSS and espcially FSF and GNU are circlejerks. This blog, at best, is a a circlepuke, where we non-freetards come to empty our guts after being nauseated by the tech press and freetardian blitzkrieg.
Looks like another organisation has fallen for Linux propaganda:
Luckily we've got the brain cells that frequent this blog to tell them what a POS their network is.
To the anonymous above:
Recognizing Linux's faults and general suckiness does make you, or anyone else, more intelligent.
Leave the presumptuousness, masturbatory self congratulation and general nastiness to the FOSS crowd.
Linux - it's a lie.
Another thought provoking, elegantly stated, nugget of wisdom from one of the brain cells.
Keep it up, you just prove my point.
How about Intel's Moblin effort? People keep claiming Linux for netbooks has failed once and for all, but surely Intel is not run by retards.
"but surely Intel is not run by retards."
2 words: Rambus Deal ;)
Intel has had a few idiot moments. We'll see whether or not this becomes another.
Linux - For the Natural Born Luser
Linux - For those who think Pity is Envy
Moblin seems really nice, but you see, it's not like Linux as a whole would suddenly become better thanks to this. Anyway that prove that the only viable way to make Linux work is the cathedral model, and being a company with a shitload of money to dump on this project helps too (because developers have to eat, you know). Also, seems like they are working on having standard ABI/API on this one, and that acually means two things: 1) applications designed for Moblin would work only on this, and 2) applications written for other Linux distros would never work if those use different/incompatible libraries (primarly I mean no Gnome/KDE apps, althoug some command-line programs could still work, but that really depends on the code).
Agreed.
Moblin is getting a lot of positive attention lately.
So does Android.
What do we learn from this?
Linux by itself is worthless. The only good thing that may come out of it is companies throwing money and manpower at it and shaping Linux to fit their needs.
Google does so, too, with its "GoogleOS".
For that, Linux is well-suited. It's a technology playground, useless buggy beta-crap on its own and you might find a few cool things here and there, but to make use of these things you need to create a real platform.
Which is apparently the one major thing the FOSS crowd can't ever do - because the whole bazaar model fails in that regard.
"It appears that the current cause célèbre freetard, Lundumb, a.k.a. Brian Lunduke,
came to the attention of the Linux Hater because Lundumb (badly) produced a video based on a presentation Lumbdumb titled, charmingly enough, "Linux Sucks!" As if far too many of us in the community don't know that already.
"Coward? You're calling Linux Hater a coward? Do you know who the real coward in the Linux community is? Her name is Pamela Jones. Yeah, that Pamela Jones, keeper of Groklaw."
Link
Does Moblin look like a default GNOME desktop to you, motherfucker? Then why are you treating it like one? Say "what" again, bitch.
And agreed also here. I mean, if someone puts money on Linux and makes something that works (and at least visually it seems that some professionalism was involved), well, there's nothing strange or miraculous. The only Linux merit is to give a 60% already-done job, open to other companies to build from. And that's fine.
Probably, that means that the possible merits of Moblin will be circumscribed to Moblin.
Uh, I'm curious to try it. I just watched the official video: no mention of Linux (good! They learnt the first lesson: don't scare the user), and a reasonable professional production (audio and video NOT made with OSS tools, I'm sure :P ).
Of course, the video doesn't answer to the first "next question" of the user: "Can I install other apps?". And I didn't say MS apps.
cheers
People keep claiming Linux for netbooks has failed once and for all, but surely Intel is not run by freetards..
FTFY.
Uh, sure, Intel is a company, if they fail, they are in deep shit. When freetard community development fails, they can always say: it's free, ItsYourFault(tm) etc.
Remember, freetard: moblin is intel's stuff. Google? the same. Apple? the same.
The word, the idea, the slightest smell of "FLOSS" is not connected at all with that.
Now they are asking the community to provide software, add-ons for it, because without that, Moblin will have a short life, and they know.
Apple did the same many years ago.
Now, please, can all freetard go home and copy some iphone apps for Moblin and for free?
Thanks.
Ooops, sorry, dear communards, I forgot: before you go and copy some apps, please check ALL the Moblin's source code.
You know, EU recently demonstrated that Intel is really $$$ addicted, so, before use their OS, I want to be sure that bugs and absence of suspicious software are checked by the common effort of the community.
ROFL.
Even Dell thinks Linux Desktop doesn't need the last version:

And to the french polcie force that are migrating to Linux desktop, good luck on your next dist-upgrade or service pack rollout. Better not add anything not in repository and or upgrade or risk breakage hell.
ROFLMAO
So, went a little further checking moblin website (no download, it seems that there's a freetard over excited assault to moblin's pages.
from the website:
This section introduces you to some of Moblins key applications; the Moblin Web Browser, and Moblin Media player.So, it's a browser and a media player (I'm not really impressed by the word "some" in "...some of Moblins key apps").
Ahhh, finally I can recognize my old, dear Linux in all its awesomness. It's the peak of the YouDontNeedThat(tm) culture.
Now, I don't want to sound pessimistic, but either they will inform *very* well the possible future customers about the real limitations of the system, or, once again, it will be an epic fail, slightly reduced by the fact that it doesn't look like shit (as the xandros os looked imo). Let's see...
Ahah, great article!
It seems that in Dell they are reading LH blog or that they would really agree with it! They also say that they don't care about what freetards think/want.
A mainstream user does not care if it's [Ubuntu Linux] 8.04 or 8.10 or 9.04 (he/she does not know what those are) -- she just wants it to work right and be stable/safe...Most of the Linux enthusiasts would not like to be so far behind (i.e., 8.04 vs. 9.04), but they are not our primary target audience for the [operating system] imageLinux enthusiasts (freetards) pwnd.
Good.
I am using linux for 7 years, not on programmers/developers level, mostly on end user usages. I'd used distro like red hat, fedora, gentoo, ubuntu (oh btw, ubuntu literally meant u as you, buntu as dead end in our language, lol) , centos and recently opensuse. For most part, I use them for server purposes, like web hosting, web apps development, bind/named, samba and etc.
For desktop experience.. those distro failed to impress me. I would rather using Windows or Mac OS X for delivering end product to my customer. Rather trying to figure out/solving problems by hardware/software in Linux for hours, which is always has been the problems with Linux distro for end user like me. It is much faster for me to author using proven software than get thick off and wasted time to deliver products in time.
For some users who has experienced in Linux may say, go to the forum to get help, use command line/syntax rather using the GUI?.. ugh I didn't know GUI is obsolete nowadays?, most beginners will turn their face away after getting difficulty in learning command line, post bugs, wait for the new fixes, the attitude of get it work on your own (hey it's free so no more question ask). But for normal people/user like us who need to feed families, we couldn't wait no more, we could pay some geeks, engineers or programmers to do it if they could do it much faster.
I could use various apps on windows/mac platform to get things done much, and get paid and continue living. It's not that we don't like linux and oss, we like them. But for less experience end user (which is populating around the globe), linux distro offer less experience which is killing linux in the end.
Unless there are no changes or revolution inside Linux community, graphic libraries, programming/developer tools, standardize tools/libraries, and issues, expect Linux no less for desktop, it is dying.
I think this blog is slowly becoming one of the most accurate tech site on the web. Really.

Just tested Ubuntu 9.04 today on a Dell Optiplex 755.
I read that some were calling Ubuntu 9.04 "as slick as windows 7 or Mac OS X"; such an opinion was written on a "respectable blog", in this case Cnet.
WTF? In just one hour this afternoon I have seen a huge amount of "Epic fails" when running Ubuntu 9.04, such as the inability to access my windows share, window content redrawing failure under X and Firefox running like crap. Aren't there some serious bloggers out there to point out how deluded these freetards are? I mean, there is only this blog which is quite well known and that's it? There's not a "well known" and "respected" blogger on Cnet to give the freetards a good reality check?
By the way, why did this Lunduke dude fail to report the ballant stupidity of such articles?
we could pay some geeks, engineers or programmers...I actually did it once. I asked the programmer of Lilypond for a feature. Luckily this really particular feature was already available through some scheme programming, so he gave me the hack, he documented it, and he told me the price for the time he spent: 25€ (15 minutes of work). He already tried to setup a pay-per-feature system, so his requests were public to the users.
I was lucky: for other features the price was of hundreds to thousands euro, and the feature I'm talking about is absolutely impossible to realize on the commercial available solutions.
But everybody can understand that this is not a suitable system, even sharing the money with other users, in particular if it's about a small, specific field (how many contemporary composers out there? :-)
What I should have done? Learn C++ and Scheme to make music and be free ? I actually learnt and still do some Lisp and and a lot of graphical programming as pure data and max.
But there's a real line between the programming skills that a composer (without a prior and proper programming education) can learn for his needs (advanced as they can be), and the programming required to make or modify a complex application. Programming is a wonderful art, but as all professions, it needs a lot of time, dedication and talent.
A 16 years old h4x0r maybe doesn't understand it, but freetardlandia is not only populated by kids, sadly.
But everybody can understand that this is not a suitable system
And I meant for both the user and the programmer, which has all my respect and esteem(in the case of the Lilypond programmer). We both have to eat.

Dr AJG’s Commentary
I probably should point out a few issues regarding my relationship with Microsoft:
1. I don’t like them. I don’t like their attitude, and I don’t like their products
in general.
2. The last time I willingly used a Microsoft software product, was in 1990: I unfortunately
used Microsoft Word to write my dissertation. (Ocasionally I have to use MS WIndows
since the classrooms I teach in have instructor computers running MS Windows, but
I don’t consider that “willingly”.)
3. Since 1993, the department I worked in has moved from NextStep, to Openstep toGNU/
Linux. (We did inherit an MS WIndows lab for a while from another department but
have changed it to GNU/Linux since then.)
4. If I am bias (and I probably am) then I am bias against Microsoft.
None of this of course means that I like unfounded accusations or one-sided
statements. Free software can and will stand on its own. We do not need to stoop
to inappropriate behaviour.
Fuck you, fuck you all!
Everyone here is a freetard. Just a bunch of freetards arguing amongst each other.
Fuck you, fuck you all!Well, you are a freetard trolling by quoting another freetard. So you are an asshole, while Dr. AJG is only a freetard.
Anyway, funny enough that a math uni teacher and gnumeric dev doesn't use MS stuff since so long time.
If I would be in him, even respecting his "attitude", I'd check every second month how excel or other spreadsheets look and work, at least to keep my effort focused... Weird.
Everyone here is a freetard. Just a bunch of freetards arguing amongst each other.
Uhu, it seems that all the freetards stopped checking moblin pages, they got frustrated, so they come here.
Come on! Go and watch "Matrix" for the n time and dream.
"Free software can and will stand on its own."
Absolutely!
But not all free software.

You are a total jackass!! Why the fuck do you care what the FOSS community is doing? You obviously dont use any FOSS do you?
Big man with real name hides his blog from the public. IRONY.
"You don't have the courage of your convictions to come out in public and support your views."
Perhaps you should read his post, like the "Do you really think I want freetards hassling me in my real life?" part. It's perfectly understandable to anyone with an IQ over 50.
"CHICKEN, you are CHICKEN PS I used my real name to flame"
An absolute nobody, that no one's ever heard of uses his real name to call some anonymous guy "chicken" on the web. Wow, I gotta give it to you, you really got some balls! It must've taken a lot of courage for sure.
This is sad, some Hatetard told me to come here for cogent arguments, all I find are some tossers arguing amongst themselves.
Until you can stop forking the hatred and put together one set of reasons why Joe Sixpack should hate Linux, people are never going to understand why Free software sucks.
I tried hating Linux for a while, but had to go back to loving it again when all you could me were pissing matches.
@May 20, 2009 10:01 PM
God that was incredibly lame. Do something more entertaining next time.
@ May 20, 2009 10:04 PM
Sorry, Lunduke was trying to hump my leg while I was writing that, I'll do better next time round.
@May 20, 2009 10:27 PM
Bring him to the vet, he could have the RMSmaniosis.
Took Lunduke to the vet, he said Lunduke's too much of an navel-gazing cuntbox to be allowed to live.
Put him to sleep right then and there. The best thing was: the vet did it for free! Said he'd tried Ubuntu 9.04 Jolloping Jackanapes, and it was 'fucking shit'.
So, no more Lunduke. Not that anyone'll notice.
@Darrin Ritter.
Your all anonymous cowards? First off, no on owns all the anonymous cowards here, and second, the correct statement should be All of your anonymous cowards... followed by a description of what the anonymous cowards are doing or being.
Unless you mean "You're all a bunch of anonymous cowards". You're is the proper contraction of the words you are and denotes the state of being of a group. As for putting a real name up, anyone can create a name online and claim it is their real name, since they're not going to have to show paperwork to prove it.
P.s. Freetards/Lintards: please note the distinction between your and you're. It is also important to know the differences between they're, their, and there; please define and discuss they're, their, and there. Extra points will be awarded.
Basically LH insults Lunduke because Lunduke's criticism of Linux is too gentle, and misses crucial points like "G-P-fucking-L". This reminds me of the RMS/Torvalds debate over whether FOSS is about ideology or about better quality software. From what we've seen in the past, I feel the linux hater community is in the danger of fragmentation. Since LH is more extreme, he's the RMS equivalent, and he showed similar traits by aggressively claiming credits (you just took my posts and made them and to slides) reminiscent of the GNU/Linux naming claim.
Lunduke is nothing but a pathetic attention whore. He "points out" the obvious and fails in proposing anything useful.
Challenging anonymous people is also extremely stupid, unless you're Mike Tyson.
Darrin Ritter, from Australia, who filed 3 bugs for Ubuntu feels like he can lecture people who have done more and for longer time with and toward Linux.
Darrin Ritter, you are nothing but a fool, first because you fail to provide facts to support your assertions, and resort to ad-hominem attacks.
Second - because you have absolutely no right to uncover the identities of those who does not wish to do so.
Darrin Ritter, you are mindless idiot, a useless old fart with no purpose in life other to fuck itself up his ass with a chainsaw.
Now please, either provide facts and engage in meaningful conversation, or I shall taunt you a second time; failing to do either - maybe because you're just too stupid - you may proceed and cut your veins. No one will care.
If to rephrase:
Anonymity is by choice, stupidity is by nature
Wait are you the Daren Ritter that cant get the touch pad working on your dumpy dildo edition of unbuntu, when it worked on the prior vulgar vagina edition? Then you also comment on your twitter +/- a few days that said dumpy dildo distro appears stable?
So wait... That makes you a liar AND a retard.
So you basciaclly agree with every hater here, only you are too dishonest to admit it, and too stupid to realize that when something (fundamental none the less) worked before, and does not work now, that precludes the possibility that it is "stable".
All you need to do now is make some stupid ass comment about "ethics" and Microsoft and the fosstard label applies to you!
Wonder why Bill Beebe was able to guarantee that if PJ "comes out in the open" that Linux Hater will crawl out from under his rock the "next day"?
Is "Linux Hater" a fat white cracker from Florida who couldn't get Ubuntu to play DVDs?
LOL!
This place looks like one of those Republitard chat rooms full of ridge browed inbreds!
Poor widdle Winux Hater is CHICKENSHIT?!!!
Bawhahahahahaha!
Are you afwaid, widdle Winux Hater?
Aw!
OMG, the complexity of the world seems to be too big for the average freetard. In their little world it works like that:
hate linux --> love MS
hate linux --> Republitard
hate linux --> your a n00b
choice of anonimity --> chicken
linux is broken --> awesome
finishing a job --> Republitard
MS/Apple/Google/BSD stuff works --> head in the sand.
little python knowledge --> h4x0r #1
ls -l | sed (or grep) x --> h4x0r #1
Now do you get the meaning of the neologism "freetard"?
Is Linux Hater Bill Beebe?
Here is Bill, ranting like the fat fuck he is:
"So here's my challenge to the Lundumb. You get PJ to come out in the open, and the very next day Linux Hater will follow suit. But until such time as that happens, Lundumb should just keep his opinions about cowardice under his hat."
D'oh!
I knew you were an idiot, but it never occured to me that you were a Bill Beebe caliber idiot!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
"This place looks like one of those Republitard chat rooms full of ridge browed inbreds!"
Exactly what I was thinking.
You can almost hear the banjos.
Lets see, denial about current status, and how it got there, and what needs to happen to get out of this situation. Uncertain if that is even possible. While detached from the common public (the great unwashed center as opposed to the activists)feel about their brand. No real clue as to how to contue, or how to reverse the current slide. Increasingly refered to as a pariah by the center.
Luminaries and activists saying things that are harful to the brand, on an almost daily basis.
People joke about its status and increasingly refer to it as a dead end.
Even the most ardent activist, not to mention horeds of former memeber of this group lament its current state. Don't think there is any way to fix.
The activists say things that are utterly delusional with regards to current status, and future direction.
And I talking about Fosstards or Republicans? You decide.
"OMG, the complexity of the world seems to be too big for the average freetard. In their little world it works like that:"
Apparently the complexity of English is more than the hapless HaterTard who wrote the above can handle.
This place is one short bus full of drooling scoolboys isn't it?
lol
Heh, the fosstards keeps calling us names.
It seems you have forfeited all attempts at coherence, and resorted to name calling.
Does your precious little Ubuntu works with either nVidia, Intel or AMD video cards yet? Is the sound layer fixed? the backward and forward compatibility? Printing? Wi-fi? Can you do anything useful with your software except masturbation and beta testing?
Oh, that's right, you cannot, and won't be able to in the near to medium to far future. Why? because your development model is a failure.
No go back to your mother's basements and ask her for some comfort sex, you pimply overweight, socially inept, reason impaired sons of whores.
And no, English is not my native language, so go fuck yourselves in advance. With a chainsaw, up your ass.
Anonimity has been used for centuries in satirical writing.
Now, without comparing the two (even if LH writing skills are amazing), do you know that many Rabelais writings were anonymous? For those that don't know, they are the biggest attack to religious obscurantism ever made in the history (by a religious person, BTW).
The author, besides being one of the biggest figure in French literature, was a key element(and with his real face) within the rennaissance humanism movement.
I've seen more republican (hysterical refuse of reasonable discussion, religious views, personal attacks, desire of conquering the world, if you mean that) attitude in FLOSS circles than everywhere else.
I don't like MS monopoly at all, but FLOSS attitude sucks and it's worst, in the sense that at least MS is a company, so they have to follow the money. FLOSS agressivity is free. As in fascism.
@May 21, 2009 5:59 AM
English is not my native language, so no problem in admitting that. Could you now please move your attack to the points I made?
Interesting strategy... The fosstards were just repeatedly schooled, and your reply seems to be along the lines of a discussion on that short bus, "Nuh Uh! I know you are but what am I!"
I guess thats means you got nothing left, except last post itis.
"Even the most ardent activist, not to mention horeds of former memeber of this group lament its current state. Don't think there is any way to fix."
Well, my pointy headed little HaterTard, perhaps it would help if illiterate mouth breathers like you stopped torturing English with your witless ruminating here.
Also, if Linux Hater hired someone who knows something about technology and could write about it without devolving into a 12 year old boy, that might help.
Who am I kidding? There is no hope for the HaterTards, although you have been amusing once in a while.
"Heh, the fosstards keeps calling us names."
Thank God you are too mature and dignified to indulge in such behavior!
I mean, except for "freetard", "fosstard" etc ad nauseam
If it was your turn to use the brain, I think you forgot to turn it on.
Once again, name calling without contents.
You may call me whatever you want, as long as you substantiate your claims. Give proofs, cite sources, demonstrate a counterpoint, and than I may have some respect for you.
Since you've proven yourself to be an idiot, you've rightfully earned the title of fosstard.
Is the chainsaw running? Your anus is waiting.
Well, my pointy headed little HaterTard, perhaps it would help if illiterate mouth breathers like you No, sorry, you attacked the english of MY post (the one with the list of sillogisms x --> y etc), and now you show me a bad english found in another post.
Should I point you to the thousands examples of "I don't read/I dont understand well, but I attack" found on this blog, posted by freetards?
You are not stupid, this is clear, but stay on the topic, please. Anyway, three answers, and you didn't provide yet any fact.
"You may call me whatever you want, as long as you substantiate your claims."
Okay, you are a sick, deviant, anally fixated HaterTard hypocrite.
Need proof? Consider these quotes from you:
"Is the chainsaw running? Your anus is waiting."
and:
"Since you've proven yourself to be an idiot, you've rightfully earned the title of fosstard."
after having written:
"Once again, name calling without contents."
It's like watching someone step on the same rake over and over again!
I knew Linux Hater was an idiot, but his fawning minions are like some new breed of SuperTard!
Dear freetards. Stop talking trash and deliver.
Make your system worth using and don't let your users down. Let people make a few honest $ with your system, and drop your religous freedom crusade.
Go fix the Intel drivers as a starter. Let me work with my OpenGL applications without having to turn Compiz off first. Let me watch my bluray discs, and give me a decent video editor.
Until then, just promise not to break my system every 6 months. Feel free to test your packages before actually releasing them.
Ok buddy, now relax and stop this crap.
Please.
You think that if I discuss about anonimity, danger of too easy sillogisms in floss culture, I'm the same person that writes "Is the chainsaw running? Your anus is waiting."
?
Look: me, you, the anus guy we are all "anonymous said..." people, but first, you mixed two different posts, insulting english skills. Me, I can recognize your writing even if we are all anonymous.
After three answers to you, I got an idea about your mentality, I didn't have any prejudice. You are exactly demonstrating the hystery of too many freetards. Anyway, if you want to discuss here, you are welcome.
It's seems you still don't understand why you're a freetard.
I'll explain myself more slowly, in a faint hope that you will understand. If you don't, well, more lulz for me.
I did not ask for proofs for my deviance, anally or otherwise. That should have been obvious, and if you've failed at that, you do deserve a flaming chainsaw up your anus.
It's seems that you somehow try to defend Linux, FOSS and/ or Lunduke.
Your defense is obviously lacking, since it is centered around name-calling and other useless rhetorical devices.
As you can see, we're all pretty much capable of name calling ourselves, and since you weren't able to conjure a defense that consists of anything else, you've earned all the scorn you deserved.
You probably couldn't understand it either, so I'll try to explain in a way you'll understand:
You've been POWNED.
I no longer have any hope for you, and you should delude yourself that there is any.
Death will be a release for you.
Please try to do it in a funny way, say, a flaming chainsaw and your anus combined, so at least you'll serve some purpose.
@ May 21, 2009 6:51 AM
Well said. Unfortunately true.
(I'm the not-native-english sillogism guy, this remark is for the freetard up there).
News flash: Linpus has apparently fixed linux
"The advantages of using a Linux system include advanced power management, optimized boot and shutdown times, as well as more WiFi and 3G support such as software development kits (SDK) from telecommunication providers, Lim said."
I wonder if something got munged in the translation...
Got many cheap laughs from this TrueBeliever(TM)
See how many times you can spot "GNU" in the post
from
Distributions use gStreamer and/or PulseAudio, etc.. DEB or RPM, etc.. GNOME, Xfce and/or KDE. Because the developers see such software as being superior.
Cute! I thought that distros were using this stuff because it was the only one available...
I told you, they'll start now the new trend, criticizing Linux in a useless way to try to get back some respect lost because of the bullshits they said (and say) for years.
Which brings to a couple of new lines:
linux hater --> troll
criticizing linux technically, socially, with facts --> troll
saying not so focused things against linux, repeating the obvious but writing gnu somewhere and putting in the first line "Linux is the best, but..." --> cool
BTW, the "russian list" didn't get any attention from lunduke and co. Sure it starts with "I love Linux", but is detailed and serious.
Head in the sand, again?
"I did not ask for proofs for my deviance, anally or otherwise. That should have been obvious"
Okay, your deviance and anal fixation is obvious. I concur.
"you do deserve a flaming chainsaw up your anus."
Okay, I get it - you constantly obsess about anal chainsaw rape.
"It's seems that you somehow try to defend Linux, FOSS and/ or Lunduke."
Really? Provide the quotes that lead you to say that. What? You can't find any? Listen moron: I don't need to "defend" anything. Linux doesn't require me to "defend" it, especially from the likes of you. Nor does "FOSS" or Lunduke, who has done a great job of revealing your hero Linux Hater as a spineless, cowardly thumb sucker!
"Your defense is obviously lacking, since it is centered around name-calling and other useless blah blah blah etc"
Again: what "defense" are you yammering about? What? You're talking out of your ass? I guess for an anally fixated deviant such as yourself that should come as no surprise! As for "name calling", isn't that Linux Hater's thing? Sure, he borrowed his schtick from smarter people, but he's better at it than his witless minions are!
"As you can see, we're all pretty much capable of name calling ourselves"
Well, if you think that repeating the names your retard hero uses on his blog makes you "capable", then who am I to burst your bubble?
"and since you weren't able to conjure a defense that consists of anything else, you've earned all the scorn you deserved."
Again: where is this "defense" you keep whining about?
Also "you've earned all the scorn you deserved"? Is that supposed to make sense? And what "scorn"? Your inadvertently hilarious gibbering? A couple of hypocritical HaterTards calling me feeble names someone else made up for them between carrying on about anal chainsaw rape? Some witless kid who I have driven into a frothing frenzy telling me that I have been "pwned"?
I guess it's true: the HaterTards have evolved into some sort of mutant SuperTard!
Who needs to "defend" anything from the likes of you? I'd rather have a few belly laughs at your expense, like I have already had here today.
@May 21, 2009 7:48 AM

ssssh, (whispering) it's not true, but maybe he'll go somewhere else for a couple of hours. BTW he didn't reply to my points, even if he quoted my comment. sigh, or should I feel honoured?
Got many cheap laughs from this TrueBeliever(TM)
God, he can't even get out of the second paragraph without throwing up distraction tactics like "Linux" vs. "GNU/Linux". And then he launches into a strawman with the claim that "insane" Linux Hater will only use commercial software and believes any usage of GNU/Linux is "wrong". While Linux Hater may believe that, nothing in his posts indicate such. Furthermore, us truly sane people don't box ourselves in the corner with arbitrary absolutes like, "I resolve to use only GNU and everything else is terrorist anti-freedom".
Then he goes back to semantics and the predictable "I think AppX is better than AppY" choice/freedom merry-go-round we've all suffered for 20 years. WantToBelieve(TM) indeed.
"I don't need to "defend" anything.".
Only a fool would try to defend that mess, and clearly you are no fool.
A yammering baboon with all the wit of a dribbling 8 year old with FAS, yes, but no fool.
Well, Linux needs no defense from the like of me.
What are you doing on this blog, than?
Got something to share? About your anus, a chainsaw, and your childhood memories?
At least try to be creative. You've been quite boring so far.
What are you doing on this blog, then?
FTFY, English Master.
I can speak for myself: I used Linux and I felt in love for the idea of an alternative. I even liked the FSF culture, at the beginning. After 7 years trying to use linux for my job, spending countless hours learning how to fix broken things, filing bugs, joining mailing lists, I literally needed for someone, much more expert than me, who was saying aloud what's wrong with Linux.
Then I found this blog.
At first I felt that only few of his rants were right, even if all were really funny to read.
I wanted to defend Linux, even when it was impossible.
Later, reading more carefully and questioning myself, I went to the conclusion that LH is really right, unfortunately. But you know, it was also the fact that this blog was partly positively reviewed by Linux-foss big names, that convinced me even more.
Linux needs more true haters, not "MStards", if they exist (I believe there are really few people around that hate Linux only because they think Ballmer is a genius).
If you don't trust me, maybe you'll trust *your* ESR, which, btw, is far from admit the slightest mistake in his bazaar concept.
In this blog, thanks to the commenters, I actually learnt the strenght and the weakness of all OSs, or at least I got a different point of view, compared to the mainstream IT journalism. Yes, nowadays is Linux that suffers from the lack of objective criticism from the press.
I'd like to see Linux supporters arguing on the technical side against LH's arguments. Claiming superiority is not defending Linux. Saying "linux needs no defense" is not an argument.
BTW, unless one is 12, admitting the mistakes is a proof of strenght. Changing broken things in practice and reality, is a proof of wisdom and care. The lack of all that can be easily called, in a synthetic and funny way, "freetardism". One can hate Linux in words (but providing facts!), other people are simply harmful to Linux, lost in their egos, lack of a common target, fanatism and no interest for the average user.
So far they were really few freetards that discussed things in detail (Oiaohm, compared to Lunduke and others, you deserve a lot of respect on that).
Can you now say (seriously) what are you doing on this blog?
Nobody knows anything about the term "Winchot"?
It's a spanish language thing, AFAIK. I asked a friend and I'm waiting an answer!
I'm in it for the lulz.
The vast majority of fosstards are extremely easy target, since they zealously believe something that can hardly be defended. That's part of the reason they revert ad-hominem so early into the argument.
xo xo xo
Chainsaw anal rape guy.
Holy God, that Lludkrab guy's blogpost. Hilarity top to bottom, starting with calling out LH for hating on Linux and not GNU/Linux, proceding to not address or even quote a single statement of LH's, and finishing up with a multi-paragraph restatement of the GNU manifesto. It turns out that using computers isn't about doing things with computers, or using computers to make your life better, it's about "freedom". So what if you can't print, at least you're not using The Man's print driver, and that's what really counts! The only thing missing is a supercomputer reference.
He's also the kind of desperate-for-attention type who responds to every other poster in his comment section. And he sure does love his "clever" "scare" "quotes"!
."
Golly, you sound absolutely *vehement* about "GNU/Linux"! And here I thought that the whole point of this blog was ostensibly to point out flaws in Linux for the love of it, and to poke zealots in the eye. Yet you are clearly a zealot who despises not only "GNU/Linux" but "its development model" and "many of its developers"! In fact, so addled are you by your festering, zealous hatred that you are induced to say flagrantly idiotic things like "its failure to deliver anything other than an anti-corporate philosophy"! Hello? What do you think this blog is being served on, brainiac? IIS?! How about the Mars rover? What OS do you think runs it? Vista? How about the most powerful computers on the planet? What OS are they running? XP Home Basic? Who is Red Hat's biggest customer? Hint: it starts with "US" and ends with "Army". How do you reconcile the increasing ubiquity of Linux with such retarded statements as "failure to deliver anything other than an anti-corporate philosophy"?
Clearly, you are having a problem coming to grips with reality.
I'll say it again: I knew that Linux Hater is an idiot*, but his fawning, uncomprehending minions are clearly a whole new breed of SuperTard!
*Your presence here vindicates that assessment.
You're claiming the Mars Rover runs on Linux? Come on.
"You're claiming the Mars Rover runs on Linux? Come on."

The RSVP System
Our software, a suite of applications called the Rover Sequencing and Visualization Program (RSVP), was developed, tested and deployed on Linux. RSVP gives MER's engineers and scientists sophisticated tools for commanding Mars rovers."
My wang's a little sore. I boned some freetard's mom last night while he was busy in the basement playing with Linbuntu Arch Mint.
>Rover Sequencing and Visualization Program
Yeah? Can you apt-get that? I only see a bazillion text editors in the Ubuntu repository.
"My wang's a little sore"
Not to worry. With advancements in penis enlargement surgery, you could be packing a rock hard 2 or 3 inches!
Oh my God, multi-billion dollar corporation creates an in-house ultra-specific use for Linux which clearly translates to a win on the desktop.
The Mars Rover uses VxWorks OS
NASA uses Linux for some of its servers, which is fine and dandy.
Most (if not all of us), criticize Linux as a Desktop OS.
Kudos on providing a reference, you might just start losing the tard suffix.
On the other hand, you failed do distinguish between server, desktop, and embedded OSs.
EverythingIsTheSame(TM).
* sigh *
Flaming chainsaws it is.
Oh, so now we're redefining what the Rover is. I wasn't aware it consisted of giant brick SGI servers. Here I thought it needed room for stuff like solar panels.
I mention the supercomputer argument, and in the very next post, some Lintard starts ranting about how supercomputers run Linux and not Vista Home. Amazing. You're as predictable and constant as the sun rising in the east. Don't ever change, Lintards.
Ahahahah, hackers switching to windows7
Look at the comments, inspiring...
Oh my God, multi-billion dollar corporation creates an in-house ultra-specific use for Linux which clearly translates to a win on the desktop.
ditto.
To the other guy, you are only few days late for the GoogleIsLinux(tm) and related.
It was discussed for few days in the second page of comments here (comments from 201 to 400):
And from LH perspective, read here:
(BTW, happy birthday (even if late) to the Linux Hater's blog and readers-commenters!)
Bring some new argument to the subject. Anyway you are probably new (if you didn't read the previous LH post and comments), welcome, and, as you see, bringing a reference to arguments is considered here. Exactly as in real world.
"Golly [blahblahsameoldfreetardedstuff]...
*Your presence here vindicates that assessment."
LOL!
If I said you were off base on your knee-jerk assessment, would you even bother to read it, or would you rather continue to flog the tired old party line of Clusters and LAMP?
I guess my comment, which consisted of nothing more than several of the core themes of What Is Wrong With Linux, touched a nerve or three, didn't it?
That's okay, son. Someday you'll realize when you're being baited.
About the same time your testies drop and you start to think that girls are more fun than getting excited over an OS that is doomed to be an also-ran on the desktop. No matter how many clusters it runs, it's still a clusterfuck on the desktop.

Synopsis: Tarleton State enters the weekend with a 9-6 overall record and is 3-5 in Lone Star Conference play, sitting among three teams tied for sixth. The Texans have been tough at Wisdom Gym, posting a 9-2 mark in 2012-13, but have struggled on the road as Tarleton State is 0-4 in road games. The Texans are coming off a 65-50 victory over West Texas A&M on Saturday which snapped a four-game Lone Star Conference losing streak.
Series Information: A&M-Commerce and Tarleton State meet for the 56th time Saturday afternoon as the Lions hold a 29-26 edge in the all-time series. However it has been the Texans that have had the upper hand in recent years, bringing a five-game winning streak into the Field House Saturday afternoon as Tarleton State is 7-3 in the last 10 meetings. A&M-Commerce's last victory in the series was an 85-67 win in Stephenville in 2008-09, with the last victory in Commerce coming in a 72-52 decision in 2007-089. Head coach Sam Walker has posted an 8-13 mark against the Texans in his career and is 4-5 against Tarleton State at the Field House.
The Week That Was
A&M-Commerce went 1-1 this past week, opening with a 67-53 loss at West Texas A&M on Wednesday. As had been the case in recent games, the Lions found themselves in an early deficit in the first half and were unable to complete the comeback. The 53 points was the second-lowest output of the season for A&M-Commerce as no Lions finished in double figures. Andrew Davis and Stefon Carson led A&M-Commerce with nine points each as Davis added eight rebounds as four other Lions finished with six points on the night. A&M-Commerce was able to reverse the trend on Saturday against Eastern New Mexico, racing out to a 23-4 lead in the first half then holding off a late Greyhound rally to earn the 84-77 victory, its 11th-straight win over Eastern New Mexico. Devondrick Walker led the way with 17 points for the Lions with Davis and Quince Jackson each adding 10 on the afternoon, complemented by nine rebounds for Davis.
Whitley Becomes Newest Member of Lion 1,000 Point Club
While the Lions suffered a defeat at West Texas A&M on January 16th, it marked a milestone night for senior forward Preston Whitley. The Frisco native finished with six points against the Buffs, upping his career total to 1,001 points and becoming the latest member of the Lion 1,000-point club. The 2009-10 LSC North Division Freshman of the Year, Whitley leads A&M-Commerce with 219 points this season, averaging 14.6 points per game while sitting second in free throw percentage (75.6%) and third in three-point field goal percentage (37.8%). He is averaging 10.9 points per game for his Lion career, suiting up in 92 games for A&M-Commerce, and becomes the second player in as many years to join the exclusive club, joining former teammate Brad Hambrick who accomplished the feat during the 2011-12 season.
Carson Emerging as Spark For Lions
When senior guard Stefon Carson rejoined the team this past season, it provided a spark the Lions had been looking for. Heading into the weekend, Carson ranks among the top-three on the club in six statistical categories, including leading the Lions in minutes played (533). Carson ranks second in points (200), points per game (11.1) and steals (26) while ranking third in free throw percentage (73.8%) and assists (52). The senior from Decatur, Ill., has also notched a pair of single-game bests, including his 26-point performance in the win at Southern Arkansas on Dec. 19th.
N'doye Electifies Crowd in Victory Over Greyhounds
Senior center Abdoulaye N'doye has emerged as one of the fan favorites in his two seasons in Commerce as the 7-0 center from Dakar, Senegal had his best outing of the season in the win over Eastern New Mexico. While he played just six minutes, N'doye recorded three blocks against the Greyhounds, then had arguably his most memorable moment in a Lion uniform, connecting on a perfectly timed alley-oop dunk from Devondrick Walker as A&M-Commerce pulled away in the second half against the Greyhounds.
Keeping An Eye on Allen
We are just over a month away from the start of the 2013 Lone Star Conference Basketball Championships at the Allen Event Center. The top eight teams from both the men and women standings qualify, beginning with the quarterfinals on March 6th and 7th, followed by the semifinals on March 8th and the finals on March 9th. If the tournament were to begin today, the Lions would be the fifth seed and would face fourth-seeded Texas A&M-Kingsville in the final quarterfinal session on Thursday, March 7th. Tickets for the tournament are now available by visiting the LSC Championship Tournament Central link at LoneStarConference.org.
A&M-Commerce Among Lone Star Conference Leaders
With the 2012-13 conference schedule reaching the halfway point, A&M-Commerce continues to rank among the Lone Star Conference leaders in a number of categories. As a team, the Lions lead the LSC in defensive rebounds (26.6 rpg) while sitting second in points per game (76.0), rebounding (38.4 rpg) and assists (15.6 apg), third in steals (7.5 spg) and fourth in free throw percentage (67.6%) and three-point field goal percentage (36.4%).
Lions Among Lone Star Conference Top-10
With the 2012-13 season back in full swing, a number of Lions continue to make their marks on the Lone Star Conference leaderboard. Five different A&M-Commerce hoopsters rank among the individual top-10 in eight different categories, led by Andrew Davis, who ranks first in defensive rebounds, third in rebounds per game and fourth in field goal percentage. Jason Smith and Tyrie Wooten also rank among the LSC leaders in a pair of categories as Smith ranks seventh in field goal percentage and ninth in offensive rebounds while Wooten sits ninth in both three pointers made and assist to turnover ratio. Preston Whitley (points per game) and Devondrick Walker (free throw percentage) round out the Lions among the conference leaders.
Looking Ahead
A&M-Commerce opens up the second half of the 2012-13 Lone Star Conference schedule, playing the second half of the home-and-home series against Tarleton State on Saturday, February 2nd. The Lions make the trip to Stephenville, tipping off against the Texans at Wisdom Gym at 7 p.m.

The Bisons had won two games Friday night as they earned the No. 2 seed in the Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament.
In the final game of the regular season the Bisons continued their hot hitting, but managed only seven runs on 14 hits. ETSU answered with 13 hits. The Bisons were also plagued by four errors.
Senior right-hander Charles Williams (1-7) made his first start of the season in an Atlantic Sun series. He pitched five innings and allowed five hits and eight runs, only one earned. He also walked three and struck out three. Freshman right-hander Davey Hackett pitched one inning and gave only one hit. Senior reliever Kyle Tognazzini closed out the game. In two innings he scattered seven hits and gave up six runs, all earned. He walked one and struck out three.
The Bisons jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the second inning. Andrew Nickerson hit a double to center field to open the inning. Chandler Wicks followed with a single to center that scored Nickerson. Allen Bolden hit a sacrifice fly to center to bring Wicks home.
ETSU answered with seven runs in the third inning and one in the fourth.
The Bisons came back with four in the sixth. Wicks and Clay Lehning both walked to start the inning. Channing Brown drove in Wicks with a single to left. With one out Bolden hit a single to right field to score Lehning. Branden Cadavid singled up the middle to plate Brown. Justin Sanders singled through the right side to score Bolden.
In the eighth the Bisons added one more run when Sanders singled to right field. He brought in Bolden who had reached based on a fielding error by the second baseman.
ETSU, which had four home runs in the game, finished the game strong offensively with four runs in the seventh and two more in the eighth.
Sanders led with a game-high five hits which was also a season-high for the Bisons. Cadavid and Brown added three hits each. It was the first multi-hit game of the season for Brown.
The Bisons are 23-31, 17-13 in the A-Sun. ETSU is 24-27, 10-20 in the conference.

Each part of this dessert was very easy to prepare. For the sorbet, rhubarb was chopped and cooked with sugar and water until tender. That was pureed with strawberries, chilled, and churned into sorbet in my ice cream maker. The next day, I made the custard for ice cream with whole milk, sugar, cream, a vanilla bean, six egg yolks, and vanilla extract. I’ve tried a few different recipes for vanilla ice cream, and I can now gauge how delicious the result will be based on the number of egg yolks used. Six is a lovely number of egg yolks for vanilla ice cream, and it was very delicious. The compote was a simple mix of chopped rhubarb, red wine, sugar, honey, a cinnamon stick, and ground cloves. That combination was simmered until the rhubarb was cooked and the sauce reduced, and then I stored it in the refrigerator. Before serving, I brought the compote back to room temperature. The last item was the cookie. The dough was made from mostly butter but also confectioners’ sugar, corn syrup, bread flour, and chopped pecans. Once mixed, it was rolled into a log, wrapped in parchment paper, and chilled. Pieces were sliced from the dough log and baked on silpat-lined sheet pans. I quickly learned that these cookies spread even more than you would think. The dough log I created was a little big, and I ended up cutting each slice in half before baking. The shape of the dough doesn’t matter so much because it spreads into a circle regardless while baking. The cookies baked into lacy and somewhat fragile wafers of buttery crunch.
I ended up with just what I wanted for flavors, textures, fruit, and nuts, but I had no idea how to make it look nice on a plate. Should I have put the compote on the bottom, drizzled it on top, or placed it to the side? What about the cookie? I couldn’t decide how to position it either. It could have been the platform on which everything else sat, or it could have rested on top like a lacy veil over the frozen scoops, or it could have sat in a more vertical pose. I played with the plating and snapped the photos seen here well before dinner time. Then, when it was time for dessert, my final plating decision was to set out a buffet of sorts and invite everyone to help themselves. Problem solved.

let me say this as clear as possible: I WANT THIS!
Rhubarb was perfect to serve to "Irish" folks. I loved the spiced compote and your cookies. And of course the ice cream and sorbet. Thanks again!
This looks nice and refreshing!
What a splendid and seasonal dessert! I'd love some of that now...
Cheers,
Rosa
Sounds so refreshing and looks very pretty too Lisa!
Nice! I love the rhubarb in the sorbet and in the compote - delicious!
The color is beautiful!
It's rhubarb season. I must try me some this year!!!! I. MUST.
Love the lacy cookie. I think you made a wonderful presentation.
Your desserts always look "show stopping". What a great way to use spring rhubarb!
Wow, this is amazing. Have a wonderful weekend.
i LOVE the different shades of red and pink in this dessert! and your brittle cookie is the perfect final touch, both in plating and eating--well done!
I have been on a huge rhubarb kick lately...have to eat it up while it's in season! Or freeze some. Hmmmm....
This dessert looks delicious! All of your little finishing touches (i.e. the brittle cookie, sauce, etc.) make it look like something a gourmet restaurant would serve.
I've been flirting with the idea of getting an ice cream machine, and your post is not helping me resist.... :-)
Wonderful!
Rhubarb is in season! Nicely presented.
Ha, Lisa I love this plant, and had a client who used to bring in so much of it for me to cook for him, not just pies, but with beet greens and spices...love this!
You might find some humor in a piece I wrote about a rhubarb experience
Hope it makes you smile...
Lisa, this is a dessert I would serve at the restaurant where I work, it looks delicious! I have some rhubarb I couldn't resist buying so I might they the sorbet, it sounds delicious!
Well done!
Absolutely divine dessert, your picture looks so awesome, I am drooling!
So Lisa. "I'll just whip up some ice cream and then make 47 other things to go with it". :) Beautiful as always.
Man, I wish I have the opportunity to attend your dinner party, this just sounds incredible. I love rhubarb and strawberries, possibly one of my favorite flavor parings. Just incredible and I think your plating looks gorgeous!
Oh I love strawberries. I am going to have to make this sometimes. Looks tasty!
oh, beautiful, beautiful. I wonder if I could already find some rhubarb here. I will definitely try the sorbet. I'm making a noch on my ice-cream maker as I type this :D
You created a beautiful dessert! I especially loved that cookie with these crunchy pecans, yum! and the plating was done fine, it looks great!
A divine dessert, Lisa!!
Beautiful & lovely flavours beautifully combined here!
MMMMMMMMMMM,...excellent food!
Gorgeous! It looks like something you'd get a fancy restaurant - well done!
omg! what a beautiful dessert...so fancy and elegant....great flavors.
Great solution to a presentation problem, lol... Whatever the look of the plate, the dish itselfs looks delicious!

Yes that is what I'm thinking... I just didn't know it was restricted to

The only attributes you can change on the built-in styles are in Tools -
Options - Writer - Basic fonts. When changing them, all new documents based
on the default template will carry the changes.
If we offer Avantgarde.ott as one document template (among others), that is
ok for me. To offer it as default template is another story.

To keep everyone up to date (Andrew already knows this): I was wrong, everyone else was right. The flat backend has a bug in it that if a given seen file frequently reuses the same inode (as will happen frequently on lightly loaded systems) you run into this strange behavior with seen state between sessions. I believe I've fixed this bug in CVS (did it a few days ago, actually) and it'll be in the next release.

If you examine cyrusdb_flat, you'll see that "fetch()" calls "starttxn_or_refetch()", which either locks the file and makes sure we have the latest version or (if it's in a non-transactional read) makes sure it's reasonably up to date.

[ppml] Policy Proposal 2007-27 - Staff Assessment
- From: Member Services (info at arin.net)
- Date: Fri Mar 21 14:48:33 EDT 2008
- Next message: [ppml] Revised 2007-14
- Previous message: [ppml] Policy Proposal 2007-17 - Staff Assessment
Policy Proposal 2007-27 Title: Cooperative distribution of the end of the IPv4 free pool Proposal Submitted: Nov 20, 2007 Date of Assessment: Mar Staff understands that this policy will establish a mechanism for the allocation of IPv4 address blocks between RIR's once the IANA global pool of addresses has been depleted. III. Issues and concerns A. ARIN Staff 1. This policy would have to adopted as an Inter-RIR policy and would have to remain the same in each region for it to work properly. 2. There is no way of reliably predicting when an RIR is within 30 days of depleting their remaining pool of IPv4 addresses since this is dependent upon the number and size of the resource requests they receive. 3. This policy would require constant monitoring of the available IPv4 inventory of all the RIRs. To be timely, a software tool would need to be developed that monitored all RIR available IPv4 inventory and produced a daily report. This same tool would need to be used by all 5 of the RIRs for consistency and accuracy. 4. When the recipient RIR approaches the source RIR for a 3 month supply of addresses, will fees be charged to the recipient RIR? 5. It is likely that AfriNIC and LACNIC will be the two RIRs who typically would have the largest inventory of IPv4 at any given time since they currently allocate address space at a slow rate and in lessor amounts than the other three RIRs. If the three larger RIRs consistently approach them for address space, it is likely that their remaining supply will quickly dwindle. 6. If one RIR will be required to review requests from another region, all such requests must be made in an agreed upon common language. 7. Process and procedures training may be required for those parties making requests to an RIR in a region other than their own. 8. If the source RIR reviews and approves requests from the recipient RIR’s customers, there are likely to be business, legal, and other administrative issues that arise. For example: - Which RIR would the requestor pay? - In what currency would the fee paid? - Which RIR would have to report the registration fee as income? - Which RIR would the requestor sign a contract with? - Which RIR would maintain the record? - Will the requestor become a member of the source RIR and if so, will they be required to pay an annual fee to the source RIR? B. ARIN General Counsel Counsel sees no significant legal or litigation issues related to this policy. IV. Resource Impact – Major The resource impact of implementing this policy is viewed as major. Barring any unforeseen resource requirements, this policy could be implemented within 180 days from the date of the ratification of the policy by the ARIN Board of Trustees. It would also be dependent upon the policy being adopted in all other RIRs. • Tracking tool with built in metrics needed to attempt to estimate the 30 day depletion mark • Survey needs to be created to ask other RIR to estimate their remaining available space • Inter RIR coordination process needs to be established for this process of surveying and follow up actions. • New guidelines • Staff training Respectfully submitted, Member Services American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) ##*## Annex A Policy Proposal 2007-27 Cooperative distribution of the end of the IPv4 free pool Author: Tony Hain Date: 20 November

What web server are you running on the Windows machine? And more important can you run php, I mean do you have the php module if IIS? Below recommendations are based on PHP. XHTML valid and syndication - WordPress, see the site in signature; it's all made with WordPress and a few plug-ins (not XHTML valid for the moment due to some code in the banner code, will change that somehow). But WordPress it's a pretty simple and lightweight Blogging system, not quite a CMS, but he does its job well. Since you are interested in syndication automatic pinging of services like my yahoo, technorati, my msn etc etc would interest you. It has this feature. I'd second the opinion on drupal. It's a goof CMS. Also if are looking for a heavy, enterprise level CMS, take a look at typo3. It's complex, well documented and has the precision of the Germans ;-).

Do you know the assumptions needed for RischNormalize? I do not know what problems with variables you see here (I am aware of tread about Polynomial Expression Integer, but I think it is a separate problem). The problem I mention really boils down to definition of roots (in praticular square root): some field computations treat roots just as a particular case of field extension. So root is an abstract quantity fully characterized by its defining polynomial. But numerical functions and some real algorithms do care which of the roots is chosen. We should systematically distinguish both kinds of extensions. When convertion from "real" extension to "agebraic" in may be wise to keep extra info around so that we can convert back without loss of information. When converting from "agebraic" extension to a "real" one we need to do a case split (here conditional expressions would be usefull). RischNormalize tries to implement Risch structure theorem: ------<start TeX> \begin{theo}\label{rischstr1} Let $K$ be a differential field with derivative $D$ and field of constants $k$. Assume that elements $z_j\in K$, $y_j\in K$ satisfy ${{Dz_j}\over{z_j}} = Dy_j$, $j = 1,\dots,n$. Then either transcendental degree of $k(x, y_1,\dots, y_n, z_1,\dots, z_n)$ is greater or equal to $n+1$ or elements $Dy_1,\dots, Dy_n$ are linearly dependent over rational numbers. \end{theo} \begin{coro}\label{rischstr2} Let $K$ be a differential field with $D$. Assume that elements $z_j\in K$, $y_j\in K$ satisfy ${{Dz_j}\over{z_j}} = Dy_j$, $j = 1,\dots,n$ and that $K$ is algebraic over $k(x, y_1,\dots, y_n, z_1,\dots, z_n)$. Also assume that ${{Dz_{n+1}}\over{z_{n+1}}} = Dy_{n+1}$ and $y_{n+1}\in K$. Then either $z_{n+1}$ is transcendental over $K$, or there are rational numbers $q_j$ such that $$Dy_{n+1} = \sum_{j = 1}^{n}q_jDy_j.$$ In the second case $z_{n+1} = c\prod_{j = 1}^{n}z_j^{q_j}$, where $c$ is a constant. ----<end TeX> so basic assumption is that we are given a computable field of constants. But rischNormalize uses operations implemented by other domains to perform actual computuations, so there are extra assumptions. One is that if an expression does not depend on a kernel (which is checked using derivatives) simplifier should eliminate this kernel from the expression. For example representing 'y' as 'x - x + y' is legal for computable fields, but rischNormalize would not tolerate such representation. Of course, since expressions are represented as rational functions of kernels such simple problem can not happen in Axiom. But (sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)-sqrt(6))*exp(x) already hints towards possible problems. -- Waldek Hebisch address@hidden

Are these files in fact going to be identical aside from the date stamp in all builds? If so, perhaps like the .elc files in the lisp tree they should be pre-generated for the release and pretest distributions. They definitely should be. I did not realize this was not already the case. Can someone please fix this and ack?

Hi Andi, during my current WinXP new installation of gnucash I encountered the "wrong openssl version" error message. It turned out that I already have an openssl.exe installed in $MSYS_DIR/bin, together with libssl32.dll et al in the windows/system32 directory. This openssl version has been installed from msysDTK version 1.0.1. I wonder whether we should remove that openssl.exe and DLLs directly after msysDTK installation? Christian

Manolis, Rest assured that we "dear gentlemen" even who share English often cause quite a bit of confusion among ourselves with grammatical terminology, especially if the terminology comes from differing linguistic models. I have often wished I were fluent enough in Greek to discuss Greek in Greek. I believe the *best* way to discuss a language is in its own terms. But meanwhile, I want to echo Moon's appreciation for the insights you provide as a mother-tongue speaker of Greek. And thank you for clarifying "analytical." glenn blank Pensacola FL

I don't know much about the placeholder code. It may be that the declared length of @P4 is derived from the data? If so, I don't know who does the inferring. I would think it would be better to derive the length from the table metadata. It must be OK to pass short values; if the column is char(10), it still should be OK to pass 'hello'. No solid answer for you, Charles, sorry. It sure looks like your zero-length parameter data is inducing a char(0) parameter declaration. Respectfully submitted, I think using zero-length strings to circumvent non-null column policy isn't the best practice. You're really saying there's no data for that column (in this row), so NULL accurately reflects reality. Zero-length strings are very mysterious in ad-hoc queries, because it's hard to see nothing. And some versions of TDS can't distinguish between NULL and a zero-length string, meaning that some clients will see a NULL arriving from a (as declared) non-null column. So, fwiw, I think you're better off making your column nullable. And you get to avoid the bug in the bargain. :-) Hope this is of some help. --jkl

[ ] Edson Tirelli commented on JBSEAM-1020: --------------------------------------- Ok, catching up with the thread: 1. I was not able to reproduce the exception in 3.0.5, but I do believe it happens. 3.0.x is not much good in handling unbalanced trees. By that I mean you have an "OR" in your rule where one side of the OR is a Role object and the other side is a User object. That is making the engine to lose itself and trying to use a User declaration/extractor to extract Role attributes. This is a bug that is fixed and working fine in 3.1M1 and later versions. If you can't upgrade to 3.1M1, I strongly suggest you to work around that creating two rules: rule RestrictNodeEditAccess1 no-loop; activation-group "permissions" when c: PermissionCheck(name == "Node", action == "edit"); Node(nodeWriteAccessLevel : writeAccessLevel, nodeCreator : createdBy) Role(userAccessLevel : name -> (Integer.valueOf(userAccessLevel).intValue() >= nodeWriteAccessLevel.intValue()) ) then c.grant(); modify(c); end; rule RestrictNodeEditAccess2 no-loop; activation-group "permissions" when c: PermissionCheck(name == "Node", action == "edit"); Node(nodeWriteAccessLevel : writeAccessLevel, nodeCreator : createdBy) User(authenticatedUserId : id -> (nodeCreator.getId().equals(authenticatedUserId)) ) then c.grant(); modify(c); end; I know this is far from ideal from a rules writer, but it is exactly what the engine does for you behind the scenes (well, at least in 3.1), so no perf implications.... just anoying for those writing the rules. As soon as it is possible to upgrade, you will stop having the problem. 2. Working memory loggers provide for now the most detailed available info of the rule engine internal workings. If that is not enough, it would be good to talk to you guys to understand the requirement and maybe add features that will comply to them. Unfortunatelly, it is not possible for now to know which LHS constraints matched and which didn't match for any given rule. You can know, though, wich rules get matched by what facts on what time, even if the rule is canceled again before firing. Hope it helps and let me know if you want more details about it. I will talk to Michael about your use case and check what we can do to help more. []s Edson >:

I think that the more important question than, "can I get MapServer to use the personal geodatabase?", is, "what data source will support the efficiency/optimization that my project requires?" Even if you can get the personal geodatabase to work, it may be that it won't perform to meet your needs. Regardless of the data format that data is acquired in, it is often recommended to convert formats or modify the data to optimize it for a Web app. Everything that can be pre-calculated, pre-sorted, indexed, etc. before the user clicks the button will make the Web app faster. The vector data optimization page is a little lean, but it is here: I am thinking that even if you can get MapServer to read the personal geodatabase, you will want to convert it to shapefile (or PostGIS if you need the relational database). You can then add spatial and attribute indexes, pre-calculate symbol classes, create a tileindex if needed, etc. David. You have to love government agencies that distribute in proprietary file formats! -----Original Message----- From: mapserver-users-bounces at lists.osgeo.org [mailto:mapserver-users-bounces at lists.osgeo.org] On Behalf Of Chuck Jungmann Sent: Monday, November 30, 2009 11:47 AM To: Dan Little Cc: mapserver-users at lists.osgeo.org Subject: Re: [mapserver-users] PGeo (Personal Geodatabases) options under Linux Responding to both of your comments: My client regularly acquires a database of property maps from a county. The database is a ESRI Personal Database. An employee of my client has been converting this database (and others like it) to MapX files for running on MapXtreme (on Windows, as you observed). I understand it to be a rather involved process. On the subject of creating a shape file from the PGeo file: one of the layer tables has almost 200,000 records. That's just for the parcel outlines. I also would need to add the text labels and other outlines as well. That would make for an unwieldy shape file. In fact, I think that employee mentioned above actually does combine the shapes into 9 MapX layers that I have been combining for display. The combined MAP files come to 221.3MB, and 351.6 MB for all layer files. I am exploring the possibility of delivering the same web application using open source software, including MapServer, on Linux. I was hoping to use the database as delivered, because it would save time and effort. Although it looked like it should have been possible to display layers from the PGeo file, I haven't had any luck. I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out if I could apply some patch, looking for insufficient buffers that I could lengthen, etc., but have pretty much come to the conclusion that using PGeo files is perhaps only feasible on MapServer for Windows, where there is native support for the MDB files. I originally asked the question because 1. I didn't want to give up too soon if someone has had some success using unixODBC and MDBTools, and 2. I wanted to know if making an exact copy of the PGeo tables in a MySQL database would allow me to use PGeo to access the layers. This seems feasible since both MDBTools and MySQL can be accessed through the ODBC layer. It would be nice if OGR wouldn't know the difference between MDB and MySQL databases because I could then run a script (that I'm working on now) that would run on Windows to make a restore file for MySQL to import the data. I hope to finish the script today or tomorrow. If it works as I hope, I'll report it here since it would answer the second question. Assuming success using MySQL, the first question is moot: MySQL would be a much more robust solution. If I can make a turnkey conversion from MDB to MySQL, it's really a no-brainer to abandon MDB. But I'm still curious, and it would be nice to document somewhere online, if it's possible to use PGeo files on a Linux-based MapServer.

NEARS QUARTERS CENTURY
(picture here) (written below "1952")
NEXT SEPTEMBER William Wilbert Wilson of Midland will complete 25 years on
the road maintenance staff of Simcoe County. Mr. Wilson, 69 on Sept. 5,
came to Midland as a carpenter 41 years ago, and save for 3 years in
Caledonia, has lived in North Simcoe ever since. Born on a farm near Vasey
now owned by Bruce Brown, Mr. Wilson operated the municipal steam roller in
Midland for some years, and was with the Brennan Paving Co. before joining
the county staff. Nearly every road in North Simcoe has felt his blade.
Some years ago his grader in the summer and snow plow in the winter were
common sights on the Elmvale-Wasaga Beach highway. He has also worked the
Waverley to Hillsdale and Coldwater stretches and on to North River. In
more recent years he has been stationed largely in the Penetang-Midland
district of Tay and Tiny but this summer was again grading the Hillsdale
section.
--------------------------------------------------
MRS. ALEX MORRISON
A former resident of Vasey, Sarah Jane (Brown) Morrison died March 18 in
Elrose, Sask. Mrs. Morrison was in her 98th year.
The last member of a family of 12, she was born in Millbrook and came with
her parents to Vasey where they lived on the farm formerly occupied by the
late J.B. Brown. In 1884 she was married to Alex Morrison in Hillsdale by
Rev. W. Hall. Mr. and Mrs. Morrison resided in the vicinity of Vasey until
moving to Hughton, Sask. in 1913.
Mr. and Mrs. Morrison celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary at their
home in Hughton on Christmas Day in 1944.
Surviving are her husband and four children; Sherwood Morrison and Mrs.
Joseph Jennett, both of Hughton, Leota and Wesley, living in the United
States.
Four grandsons acted as pallbearers at the funeral service; Keith and
Sherwood Jennett, Glen and Larry Morrison, and two great-grandson, Ted
Galvin and Ronald Smith. Interment was in Hughton Cemetery, March 22.

HENRY L. LOVERING
Last week, Mrs. R.A. Elliott received word that a brother, Henry Langston
Lovering of Regina, had passed away, April 1, in his 87th year.
Previous to his retirement Mr. Lovering had been attached to the Department
of Agriculture, Regina, for many years.
He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. John Lovering, late of Coldwater. Of a
family of 14, nine boys and five girls, four survive, Mrs. R.A. Elliott
(Hattie) of Coldwater, Mrs. C.E.A. Goldham (Aletta), Miss Mary Lovering,
retired nursing sister, and Judge Egerton Lovering, all of Toronto.

A Few Pics… April 7, 2008Posted by littlebangtheory in Art and Nature.

…from the weekend.
This is “Morning In America,” at least the America where I live:
Walking through the woods along a spring freshet, these turkeytail fungi caught my eye -
I found myself in a spruce clear-cut,with the corpses of mature trees piled twenty feet high at my back, and a gusty wind orchestrating the rain-stick rattle of last season’s goldenrod:
And at the end of the day, reflecting on nature always grounds me, so this seemed appropriate:
wow! especially the 1st one!
Gorgeous.

Creationist Governor Featured Speaker at RNC Meeting
Governor Tim Pawlenty (R-Minnesota) is being touted as a frontrunner for the 2012 presidential election, and today it was announced that he’ll be a featured speaker at the Republican National Committee meeting in San Diego.
Gov. Tim Pawlenty will address members of the Republican National Committee July 30 in San Diego. It’s a chance to introduce himself to party leaders, Politico reports, quoting an unnamed adviser’s view that “a lot of Republicans don’t know who he is.”
Pawlenty is expected to offer ideas for expanding the party’s base and tell his life story, from growing up in South St. Paul with a truck-driving dad, to maintaining his own hard-driving no-tax stance as governor at a State Capitol now dominated by Democrats.
Like Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and almost every other so-called GOP “frontrunner,” Pawlenty is a creationist, who’s in favor of teaching “intelligent design” creationism to children as science. When the news came out that Sarah Palin had stated she wanted to teach “intelligent design” last year, Pawlenty rushed to agree with her:.
Then, of course, Palin reversed her position and said she did not believe in teaching creationism. Big oopsie for Pawlenty!
In that interview with Tom Brokaw, Pawlenty went on to spout talking points from the Discovery Institute, and attempted to dodge the issue of whether creationism should be part of school curricula. But he made it very clear that he’s a creationist himself:.
In other words, if local school boards want to teach nonsensical pseudo-science to schoolchildren, Pawlenty’s just fine with that. After all, he believes the pseudo-science himself.
(Notice that Pawlenty doesn’t distinguish between “intelligent design” and creationism. The true believers know that ID is a facade for good old-fashioned creationism, despite the Discovery Institute’s massive propaganda campaign to mislead people into believing it isn’t.)
This is a huge problem for the GOP, and it’s one reason why Democrats control both houses of Congress. If the GOP puts up a creationist for president, expect to see Democrats in power for the next 8 years (at least).

My love for this natural remedy is growing as the years go by... not only is apple cider vinegar effective for treating tummy upsets, we've recently discovered that when taken every 30 minutes, it stops a sore throat dead in it's tracks! I've used this method successfully over the past 6 months and find it to be much more reliable and effective than using oregano oil. It's less expensive, also - so a win all around :)
As to dosage, I usually take approximately 2 TBSP in a half cup of water. When taken at the first sign of a scratchy/sore throat, and repeated faithfully every 30 minutes, relief will usually be felt after just a few doses... I don't like the taste of ACV, so I plug my nose and drink it down quickly. The short term discomfort of the taste is preferred over getting sick, so I suffer through it :)
Sore throats are usually the first sign that a cold/influenza is on the way and I've noticed that people will spend a lot of money to try and ward illness off. I'm encouraging you to give apple cider vinegar a try ~ it is highly effective and very inexpensive.
Let me know if it works for you!
Apple cider vinegar has a long list of health benefits. I think fighting high cholesterol is one of them. I'm not sure I could drink it everyday, but, I'll try it with the next sore throat!
Ooooh! Now I wish I had a sore throat so I could try this out!
Sherri I did this when I felt the first stirrings of a sore throat the other week. Only took two doses and all was good.
Great, Becci!!!! It really does work well :)
So does it relieve the pain of a sore throat or actually cure whatever is causing the sore throat? Or both? I'm just a but confused? Thanks in advance for the clarity.
:) Krista
Hi Krista, it eliminates the pain by killing whatever "bug" has caused the sore throat in the first place. If you catch it early (at the first sign on a sore throat), you'll be feeling right as rain in less than a day!
Thank you for replying. I am giving it all it's worth but to no avail. My daughter and I still have terribly sore throats, slight headaches and the very back of our noses (kind of where the nasal cavity and throat meet). I'm wondering if our problem is allergy related because the ACV, raw garlic, honey, salt water gargle, Advil Cold & Sinus tabs are not working very well. I mean, all of it takes the edge off for a bit but then the problem comes raging back.
Oh well, I'm not giving up because I have learned that ACV is also good for bad choleterol, high blood pressure etc. :)
Thanks again!
Krista
Sorry you aren't feeling well :( I have only used it a handful of times (maybe 6 or 7?) to treat sore throats, so I don't have a LOT of experience, but it has worked every time (possibly because I started taking it at the very first inkling of a sore throat). It is so important to do it RIGHT AWAY before the "bugs" have a chance to multiply and take over.
The other thing we do is sniff warm salt water HARD up each nostril (from a spoon), one at a time until the saline solution hits the back of your throat. It's gross, but it works incredibly well to kill cold bugs in the nose and throat. Do it over the sink!
Hope you feel better soon XO
I couldn't agree more! I struggle with an illness where I have a very weak immune system, and since finding ACV have had to go through a lot less pain and colds. A couple of cups a day bring me a lot of relief. Good on you for spreading the word :)
Danielle, I'm sorry to hear that you are immune compromised, but glad that you are finding success with apple cider vinegar. We were travelling out of province just last week and 2 of our kids came down suddenly with a GI bug. The rest of us were able to ward it off with ACV :) Whew!
I've taken 4 doses so far and don't feel any different. I'm not sure if I can keep this up though. What's the most amount of doses you've had to take?
Better now:)
Oh good!!!!! Sometimes, I have taken up to 6 doses :) It's really yucky, but it sure works. The earlier you catch it, the less doses you have to take.

Even tucked safely into his tour bus bunk, lighting director Garry "Sport" Waldie can still hear the girls screaming. At truly ear-shattering decibels, they're voicing their love for Justin, JC, Joey, Chris, and Lance--better known as 'NSync.
Waldie has been handling the lighting for the band since its first club tour in 1998, and since then the joyful noise has only grown. "It's a great show with a lot of energy," he says. "Obviously, the audiences are enjoying themselves, so they just add to it."
When it became apparent late last year that arenas and stadiums would be needed to comfortably fit these growing legions of 'NSync fans, the band's management brought in production and lighting designer Steve Cohen. Cohen got to work with associate Jim Day to put together a design for a new tour that began in March. "We opened up my 3D Max program and got into the design process and produced some color renderings, which they loved," Cohen says. "The style guide that I got from them included edgy, surfer-type graphics. I went to a bookstore and researched surfboard graphics, and those became inspiration for a lot of the shapes in the set and color choices in the lighting looks. We tried to evoke something of that nature. We did a couple of revisions, then All Access built it for us."
Cohen also helped create the tour's original opening segment. "We had a blacklight dance sequence where they came out in costumes that glowed in the dark, battled this mysterious monster, and a did a very interesting African dance with sticks--it was really powerful," Cohen says. "But when they began the shed leg this summer, they changed it to a Mission Impossible opening that has them flying in and rappelling down to the stage at the beginning of the show."
'NSync also takes flight at the end of the show. "The guys wanted to fly into the house during the song 'Sailing.' Doing that added an additional truck and a half of rigging hardware and an additional 20-something points for the flying rig, which I had to integrate into my front followspot truss and the front truss on the stage," Cohen says. "There was a learning curve that was required in integrating the two systems. I initially tried to make it all one piece, and everyone advised me against it because number one, it would slow down the day, and number two, it was two separate structures that needed to be taken care of independently. One couldn't wait on the other, and since we were flying five stars, their safety was obviously an absolute priority. So the guys from Branam Enterprises specifically took care of that, and they were great. We ended up having a monstrous amount of cables with the trolleys out there, but it got sorted out, as things do, in a couple of weeks on tour."
While the flying gag was definitely the band's idea, how it got integrated into the show was Cohen's job. "I had to take all of the structure, make it work within the show, and make it look good," he explains. "We ended up doing this five-fingered array out into the house, and the guys used the downstage edge of the stage as their launchpad. When you see the show you realize how powerful it is to have these guys fly out over your head. They're all very athletic, so they are really able to pull it off."
Once the rigging points and design were sorted out, the LD put together the lighting system, which features the Coemar automated line of luminaires. The Obie Company is the tour's main lighting contractor. "Obie's high-density trusses are interesting--a lot of the gear rides in the air, so it's a very efficient system," Cohen says. "I, of course, came up with my typical vertical element, which I seem to go back to in every show. This time I built three vertical trusses that had strobes and a collection of moving lights that had to be hoisted up in the air every day, which was a pain in the ass, but they created a great background.
"I used the Obie/Coemar combination again because it was really successful with Enrique [Iglesias]," Cohen continues. "We have some Wybron Colorams up there for color changers and followspots, but it's mainly a combination of Coemar wash lights, hard-edged lights, and 2.5k NAT lights, which were dotted around the show. I keep going back to the purity of color in the CF1200 because I find that it has an incredible range. It's such a bright instrument and I was able to pick a color palette that was acceptable for the type of music and the style that I wanted. There are a lot of lemon yellows, bright whites, and steel blues, which are compounded one on top of another to create a cold, icy effect that works with a lot of the colors of the surf graphics. There are also some really rich ambers and reds in there that you can pull off with this light."
Programmer Arnold Serame helped Cohen create these desired effects. "I hadn't worked with Steve in a long time, so it was really cool to get that partnership together again," Serame says. "It's awesome to work for him because when he has a very specific idea, he goes for it. But he's willing to say that his idea doesn't work if that's the case. And when I've got ideas, he always tells me to run with them. He'll look at everything I have to show him, which fosters a very open communication."
Cohen and Serame were joined by Waldie to create a unique FOH lighting triumvirate. "It was an interesting situation. Sport knew the music really well because he had taken this show out before, but I didn't know it at all," Serame explains. "There are programmers who like to immerse themselves in the music of whatever show they're about to do, but I'm not like that. I like listening to it when I have the light rig and after I've figured out what the light rig can do. To me, it's about whatever that first impression of the music is and what my initial feeling is about how to bring that to life. I don't like thinking about it too much beforehand because I think that's how people end up going back to their old techniques. It was a great combination because Steve knew the music and the choreography pretty well. Sport knew the music inside out and he knew the way they used to do the songs. I didn't know the music, but I knew the rig the best, and I was the one who eventually had to create it."
Production rehearsals lasted about a week in Palm Springs, FL. "When you work with Steve, it's not just about putting on a great show--it's almost as if the show is another step in having a great life," Serame says. "We'll go out, have dinner, and come back and exchange more ideas about the band and so forth. By the end of each evening we had written a few more songs. Steve turns it all into a great experience."
Cohen reports that Serame deserves the credit for getting the work done so quickly. "It was very interesting to work with Arnold because he's got incredible experience working with so many different lighting designers," Cohen says. "It was hard for both of us not to fall into our old tricks. We tried to reinvent some of our own gags, and he's so facile and so fast that we were able to see results, realize what we had, and move on. The work was done in record time for the amount of cues that were in it. He's a joy to have on set. Peter Morse often says that we're really the sum and substance of the people who program for us. In this situation, it was interesting to try to communicate to each other in a common language, so it was a bit of a learning curve."
As lighting director, Waldie also had a learning curve to take on with the new design. "Sport was at a disadvantage at first because he had designed their first tour, and it was kind of hard for him to let go of how he had done it before," Serame says. "Steve liked leaving certain passages in a cue even though there were a lot of musical accents, to emphasize what the boys were doing onstage. Sport didn't really understand it until he saw the whole thing together with all the new choreography, music, and staging, then it made sense to him. It was amazing how he was able to get these complex songs down so quickly.
"That was part of the programming challenge for me," Serame continues. "It's one thing to program for yourself if you're designing or operating, but how do you program when someone is designing and someone else is operating? So I first had to ask Sport how he wanted the cues structured: theatrically, where you've got one go button and little break-out flashes? Or do you want a cue on each handle in rock and roll style? We'd sit down and talk about the songs. It wouldn't have made sense for me to write cues for Steve's ideas if Sport doesn't feel natural to run it without thinking about it, because there is so much to keep track of. He had to know naturally where every cue was, and keep his eyes on the boys and keep the followspots straight. Sport could tell Steve and I where each guy would go during a song and which guy sang every chorus of every song, just by listening to it. It was a great partnership that way."
Even Serame had trouble understanding Cohen's vision at first. "What struck me most about how Steve built the show was that there were sections with huge musical accents, and I didn't get at first why he would let other sections go without picking up the musical accents," he says. "Once I saw the choreography, I understood it. That's where the show is really brilliant. For a show that easily could have been flash and trash, Steve showed a remarkable amount of class and restraint in lighting the guys and not the event. He really highlighted and showed off the guys for what they could do. When he chose to go over the top, he did it at the appropriate moments, but it isn't a whole show of that. We had a blast."
The band members also got into the production process. "The guys were very involved in all the decisions," Cohen says. "When they saw the looks for the first time Justin walked over to me and said, 'I feel kind of silly, because we're oohing and aahing like it's a fireworks show.' But when we played some tracks and ran the lighting cues, they were blown away. It was successful because they walked onstage feeling that they had something really interesting and fun behind them. They're very hardworking and very diligent."
The show also featured a central video display. "We incorporated the Jumbotron (the tour has since upgraded to an LED screen) into the show, and framed it with a 50s-style television screen," Cohen says. "This is really the first time I've integrated video into a show. It's the central upstage piece and also provides a great deal of backlight."
Dave Davidian is the tour's video director. "He walked into this position and not only filled the directorial shoes, but also created an incredibly exciting show," Cohen says. "It would not be as good as it is without him. This was first time I ever worked with him; I've only ever known him as a lighting designer and one of the things he brings to the plate here is an energy that comes from having done lighting cues--except here he's utilizing the camera for it. So it's incredibly musical and the shots are beautiful. It would not be the 'NSync show without him."
Davidian agrees that his lighting design background has informed his video direction style for the show. "Just like with lighting, I feel the video is there to enhance the music--I'm there to intensify the background and amplify it to a certain degree and communicate what the artist is trying to do," he explains. "My job is to help themessage of the performer get sent to the whole crowd, as strongly and cohesively as possible. My lighting background helps me a lot--certainly I'm trained to follow the activity. As a lighting designer you put spotlights on the people you want to highlight. I tend to do the same with the video, which is good in an Imag situation. Some video directors go with cuts, like on MTV videos where they cut away from the prime action--certainly sometimes they do that for valid, creative reasons, but with Imag your job is to provide the people in the back with a closer look at who is doing the prominent activity and highlight the whole band when they're working together."
Davidian also put together video clips to create the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s montage that backs up the band as they change costumes and pay tribute to each era. "I used the digital effects machine, and I keep developing that as the tour goes on," he says. "Mainly I stick with the Imag. The five of them are all good friends and that really comes out when they're onstage--they're having the time of their lives."
Davidian handles his responsibilities from the enviable backstage position. "Being backstage is a benefit because it does protect you a little from the girls' screaming--but I felt the same way when I was out with AC/DC," he laughs. "They're very nice guys and it's a fun show. My 11-year-old daughter loves them, too. Those little girls are our employers, so they can scream all the time as far as I'm concerned."
The band is currently doing promotional appearances in Europe and will resume touring this month in the US. With a new album scheduled to come out next year 'NSync has already tapped Cohen to design its spring tour. "I'm also doing Britney Spears' tour--it's all the same management," Cohen says. "They're surrounding these younger acts with high-caliber production, and Darrin Henson, the choreographer, is spectacular. They spent enough money on a production to go out there and do a great show, and young acts don't get this opportunity that often, so they come in and work their butts off to pull it off. People are going to these shows and they're getting much more value because they're being entertained in the old-fashioned way. I'm 45, and my primary clients have been rock stars who are older than me, like Billy Joel, Elton John, Don Henley, and Fleetwood Mac. To come in on this new wave and find a niche is great."

The official CAD images above, from the Advanced Projects & Technologies (AP&T) directorate of India's Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) provide further perspective on the low-observable design elements that are known to be going into India's Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), known for a while now to be a stealth aircraft concept. Serpentine air intakes (with minimum flow distortion and robust pressure recovery) and internal weapons bays, depicted in the images above, are some of the most critical nose-on low observability design elements going into the programme..

And like all other projects, our Sarkari company will float a tender for foreign co-operation in this also while our babus eat their tiffin.
First finish the LCA mk2 and then take on this challenge!
In fact this project seems like a complete waste of time and money.
India should now fully concentrate on UAV technology. With whatever we have right now plus MMRCA we can easily defend our skies for a next few decades. By then UAVs will be the king of the skies. What's the point of this aircraft then?
The MCA is going to be sooo good! Much like after the experience of building Dhruv, the LCH came out much better than expected! Go DRDO!
People criticizing DRDO's efforts at collaboration with foreign firms have probably never been in an engineering project before. At the end of the day, what is important is the completion of the overall fighting platform on schedule, not whether it is 100% indigenous or not. The indigenization effort can't be allowed to hold up product delivery. This is what the Armed Forces have been saying for years.
Thanks Shiv.....A request please add captions.
Interesting that ADA has moved from a delta-wing design (look up the MCA page on wikipedia for the very first preliminary designs), to a design that is almost a copy of the F-22A Raptor.
Which is a good thing.
Its better to rip off proven technologies than to reinvent the wheel.
when does ADA think it can roll out the AMCA ?
Will the more powerful kaveri-snecma engine be ready by then?
Will the AESA radar PLANNED to be developed for LCA be ready so it can also be integrated with AMCA ?
Is it gonna be 100% indigenous ( avionics , etc) or will there be any foreign sub-system as in the proposed AURA programme for the UCAV ?
I checked in Wikipedia ... other than being lighter than f-22 & pak-fa (if its in 16 -18 tn range)
it doesn't come out even as 2nd best acc. to any of the specs.
Shiv could you also give an update on arjun mk-2 & lca mk-2?
Is the DRDO going to develop a future MBT or is the arjun mk-2 gonna be the future MBT ?
Is the DRDO working on an APS suite for arjun mk-2?
Under the AURA programme is ADA gonna develop just 1 kind of UCAV or diff type (like a whole new range of MALE , HALE UAV's & UCAV's) ?
Oh, polycarbonate canopy sounds very interesting. Why the departure?
Anon@9:35. Do you have any clue of the effort that has already gone into the LCA and related projects? What makes an anonymous mouse on the Internet talk about extremely well educated folks who have sacrificed careers in corporations for smaller salaries and national interest? Cheer the effort, will you?
this different from the indian version of the russian fifth gen fighter right?
minus all the crap, I am optimistic and I suppport the effort
Thats Great... Can you give us some latest information on the AVTAR RLV project please
Those criticizing DRDO's indigenous efforts should realize that even the Russian Missiles have Texas Instrument Chips!!
No country can afford to develop 100% indigenous eqp. All the countries are sharing knowledge and expertise with one another. Abrams tank has tech of Britain (armor), Germany (Gun) and other countries. Israel's Merkava is also a development of a British tank.
USA's latest Chopper the Lakota looks like a replica of our Dhruv. Reason for their similarity is both have been designed by the same German company! Russia collaborated with Italy for their latest subs.
We are still an infant learning to crawl. What's the harm if we take the support of grown ups in this field?? After all can you learn without the help of good teachers?
Anon@11.11
You are right on the dot. Ill informed bashers of indeginous efforts with a view to demoralise or scuttle them should be told off in no uncertain terms.
Hiding behind an anonymous cloak and spewing sarcasm does not in any way encourage Indian scientists and engineers from weaning the country off its foreign dependence.
It looks a bit like the much speculated JF-17 Mk2, except for the use of 2 engines and the use of conventional intakes instead of DSI.
people seem to behave as if they understand the "design" process. well they are always allowed to ask unnecessary question. specially on the post or blog like this...which is good...it clears of the crap...and whatever goes ahead in form of doubt is much more clearer...
i think its good time to start AMCA. as it'll mature with time. and give us key experience again in building future gadgets for our industry and armed forces...in recent times...if we don't push ourselves...some nations will move to such a stage that...they'll become untouchable and will start holding the destiny of many nations...so we need to push in technology sector...one more thing...if someone asks that, what about lca mk2,UAV...after AMCA launched....i think they should check the word multitasking in the dictionary....for multi role organisation like DRDO.
Onle two LGB's and 4 Long range SAM's? I assume there are 2-4 IR short range SAMs.
Is this loadout of much use? It seems to be too little to me.
What is that in the wing, another fuel tank or a radar just like the T-50?
Should this information be on public forums? (rhetorical, not literal question)
2 ton internal weapons for a deep strike aircraft?
atleast 3 - 4 tons will be logical.
i completly support drdo ripping of other countries technology .if the chinese can rip off .why cant we ??? after all we arent stealing .we are just reverse enginering it. :-)
Just a few silly designs and the party is on.
Mr. Terminator - You are looking for trouble - Sir! and you will find it in your life. You know nothing excepting choosing the right sides, and pouring English Language - of which you know almost nothing.
By the way, Terminator is a great lead on your profile, than Anonymous. Focus on the article - Buddy!
Why should you not permit constructive criticism against DRDO? Does "Way to Go - DRDO" help? Are you their salesman with personal profit to make?
You were probably the one condemning the Arjun Tank,AGNI-III praising the LCA, Dhruv, LCH - in short being the head chief commentator and running the destinies of how Indians should behave?
Keep asking those silly questions which you should attempt to find an answer to yourself.
You know who I am. There are many who like to clone me. That is what you are good at - all of you.
Cloning people, issuing threats which you cannot back up, and vomitting rhetoric.
Let me wise you freaks on something. Keep your praises, giggles and tears for your family.
If you have something to offer as information - present it forth.
Rather than - "I see a shaft below the nozzle - it looks like F-22. We should not reinvent the wheel. Every nation borrows from another. USA has copied the Dhruv. The reason the designs are similar is that the company that designed the Dhruv is German."
Just goes to prove what I have always maintained.
Dont get too cocky if you know C#, .NET, ADO, XML, T-SQL.
And remember, keep DRDO, ISRO out of it. They owe you nothing. You all are renegades like Ajai Shukla, etc. You want US weaponry and feel happy selling and buying philosphy.
Enjoy making enemies and turning the Excel Pivot Table back and forth - It does pass time.
Good Luck!
With the inclusion of HAL Tejas, MMRCA, Sukhoi Su-30MKI, AMCA, T-50 and FGFA our forces are going to be definitely stronger. Welcome step for AMCA.
Are there any indications as to when this is expected to be inducted? In neither of the 2 posts you have made, you have mentioned this.
In the older post, you mentioned that there is no backup plan to the engine should the kaveri/snecma fail to arrive. what then? will we have to wait another decade or 2 while something else is retro-fitted?
will they put a lightening pod in it as it is going to be a multi role aircraft. so my question is where are they goin to place it? will it be like the f 35 in the nose so the pod does not compromise the stealth. Shiv can u also give some info about the radar goin to be used. Will it be
a distributed radar system. I hope it is !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! anyways all the questions aside i give all my best my wishes to all the people working on this plane :))))))))))))
i like the project..nd its to proud..
But i'm not happy wit livefist puting all imp info online..first up al india's nuclear submarn' image nd now mca disgn...it like gavin al hint to enmz
Well looking at what the engineers are developing can we expect some of these tech in the LCA mk2??????
Will the changes in LCA mk2 be similar to the changes brought in F-15SE??? as that will get the LCA somewhat near to a 5th generation aircraft and will suite the airforce better even 10 to 15 yrs down the lane.
Also the fact that the aircraft rolls out in 2014 should provide the ADA sufficient time to integrate whatever 5th gen tech they develop by that time.
Doing so, the 4 years time for mk2 will become more justified.
just hoping that they do bring in those tech upgrades in mk2
Guys,
I think there are very good people on this web site. And they come from many backgrounds. Like I come from Computers. Why not some of us think to make something which can help our nation to rise faster. We all have strong passion for defense (NO attack, but defense). We need a place where we can guide our young generation to be scientists, engineers designers and whatever which can contribute to defense. Anyone agree with me ?
Anon@12.57
I was just supporting Anon@11.11. In no way did I point a finger at your drivel. Stop threatening. It does not serve any purpose. BTW I have been and am still an avid supporter of indigenous efforts, by DRDO or any other entity which would help India to save foreign exchange and at the same time provide employment to Indians instead of bailing out production houses in the west that are on the verge of closing down their assembly lines.
Don't go off at a tangent and deride others of their language skills when yours is nothing to gloat about. Learn to be polite, civil and courteous even if you are not face to face with the person whose opinions differ from yours.
Have a good day and chill down.
P.S. I chose 'the terminator' nom de guerre not to terminate guys like you in a forum but just as a convenient handle.
Shailendra@12:32AM
Great thought...
I agree, that this pool of talent can do a lot of good things for those who fight to save us.
What the need is a platform and a leader to guide.
Just 2 tons of weapon load. Will it be able fulfill the role of Deep Penetration Strike bomber? As per my best knowledge, it is slated to replace Jaguar & Mig 27.
@Anonymu 10:44 AM
Buddy, why not to make a web site, where we invite people for writing articles for guiding for defense ?
See may be I have not all my thoughts at place right now, but I think people here can have more like me. Believe me we all have good intentions, and if we can be united we will be helping so many. I always watch videos on youtube for F35 and other things, and my family says why you do not design a fighter plan ( sometime they just pinch me :)) But why I can not ? at least I can inspire and motivate youth to do that
Read this news
The organisers included the US department of defence.
And where the hell DRDO or MOD were ?
This is what is called as talent hunt, after few years these students will fly to US and will be involved in some cutting edge tech like F 35. Why we do not have such a environment ?).
Shailendra@10:06PM
OK thats fine but how do you think we will be able to guide i.e how will the ideas reach the stage where the actual decision making(for the forces) takes place.
I would like to know the road map for such a venture.
Hi Shailendra,
I am ready to develop site,decide the name, book the domain,push a message here, i will start work.
thank you
What do you guys think about 1) AMCA should have internal room for at least 2 more AA missiles since it is ment to penerate enemy territory deeply; 2) current plan should center around Israel AESA radar and Eurojet EJ200 engine. And later replace EJ2oo and Israel AESA radar with kaveri and indigenous AESA radar when they are ready.
The biggest stealth feature seems to be the absence of a vertical stabilizer, one of the heaviest contributors to the RCI profile of an aircraft. Designing an aircraft without those though, brings about a million computing headaches, which is why indigenous agencies are going to have to come up with a much more powerful flight computer than they are used to deploying on most IAF aircraft.
The Indian MCA project (now AMCA) is a joint Indo-Russian(MiG) project n NOT a wholly Indian endeavor as made out to be. Here is the Link in suuport of the above:
It make me feel proud.
I am sure all those people who are saying that the delay and high cost behind tejas are not aware of the level of complexity behind such a high tech flying machine. Tejas is a big learning phase in indian aviation industry. I can surely say that the next fighter craft (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA)) would take much less time and less development cost. As happened in case of HAL Dhruv to LCH. Dhruv took a long time to come up, while LCH came within 2 years !!! because of the know how to develop a helicopter was already available for LCH.
And all those who talk about full indigenous crap, should know that its not possible because of the patented technologies used in many products, u can not make them even if you are capable of !! Secondly why reinvent the wheel, use the available components and make proper use of it !!! thats intelligent. Once you have the aircraft in production line, you can gradually develop manufacturing facility of foreign origin products on your own, but first focus on get the thing to fly OKAY !!!
Also best wishes to "National Civil Aircraft Programme". I have faith in Madhavan Nair :)
Go India Go !
Nice.
Good luck India.
ADA, HAL & TEAM NEED TO OPERATIONALISE
LCA WHICH IS STILL NOT IN THE FINAL STAGE (WITH DELAY AFTER DELAY)
THEN THEY SHOULD WORK FOR AMCA.
OTHERWISE AMCA WOULD BE FOR ANOTHER
20 YEARS BEFORE BEGINING ITS FIRST FLIGHT TRIALS.
IN THE MEANWHILE, THE IAF WILL CONTINUE TO BUY FOREIGN MADE JETS/PLANES. GOOD !!
The AMCA will roll out by 2014. The Indian version two-seat FGFA will also roll out in that same year (if not in 2013). IAF would induct the first of the batch of 50 Russian-version PAK FAs by 2015, FGFA first flight could be by 2013-2014, and AMCA first flight by 2016-2017, FGFA & AMCA would be inducted into IAF from year 2020. Good, real good...i think this decade in Indian skies is going to be very hot...three stealth fighters showing up...i just hope everything goes as per schedule.
To make a stealth aircraft is very challenging.To make a stealth combat aircraft is a "no-hoper" if one is going to maintain any worthwhile time scale. It seems we are treading the LCA - world class- and MiG replacement-path again.As Einstein said "It is stupidity to repeat the same thing and expect different results".
I thought a cranked LE is anti stealth but the model shows just that.Hmmm...
Finally stealth requires internal weapons carriage which means a large draggy airframe and a large easy to hit target.Is stealth or perhaps "super stealth" ( a little cosmetic angling does no harm)another of those fashionable marketing ploy? I have been an Aircraft nut long enough to see many such come and go after being dropped like ahot potato.
Prodyut
PEOPLE WHO ARE JEALOUS MAKE UNNECESSARY COMMENTS.ALL THE BEST DRDO
I feel it is very expensive to upgrade the mirages for 41 million dollars a piece almost same cost of the Tejas MK2 . It is equally expensive evan to but rafale , it is fourth generation technology.It is costly a lot right now and avionics upgrade is needed every 7-8 years. If Dassault is looting 41 million for mirage upgrade they would loot 100 million plus for rafale upgrade.Rafale would be made available beyond 2018 so why not to develop AMCA with GE 414 IN5S6 engines and develop it with the more advanced version of AESA radar which is being developed for Tejas MK 2. This all process can be developed in 5 years if they plan now and in 6-8 months fly the prototypes. It would be cheaper and better to upgrade the homegrown fighter.I feel it is high time take help from Japan as well as Korea as they are also in need of a fighter due to china's posturing in the china sea.Rafale has obsolete underpowered engine.Stop the production of Tejas MK1 and go directly to AMCA.The money remains at home and if a determined effort is made we can have a world beater.

This is right outside of my room. It is the first thing that the kids are expected to do before they even come in and put their backpacks away. There is a picture for each lunch choice (a-e clips on the wall) and then they find their name and put it in the matching box! If they are cold lunch, then they put it in the red lunch basket.

Head on over to the Gravity Ghost devlog if you’re interested in seeing how I think about animation and character design. It turns out that designing a character who is both dead and endearing is quite a challenge.
If you’re reading this site, there’s a good chance you’re open to the idea of making your own games. I’m here to tell you that making your own art isn’t as difficult as it sounds, especially if you’re interested in improving your drawing skills. It’s a good way to level up your art really fast, and leave each game looking better and better.
The art for my first two games was largely created in MS Paint. And while I wouldn’t actually recommend that if you’re interested in having wrists that work, it did sure teach me a lot about making readable game art.

Road Trips Around Sydney
Sydney, Australia. Photo credit: Destination NSW.
David Elliott wrote this guest post on road trips around Sydney. He is a freelance writer who loves to get away whenever he can to immerse himself in foreign cultures and lap up the history of great cities.
There are loads of things to do in New South Wales, and a road trip of the area around Sydney in particular will throw up new experiences around every corner.
The landscape is rich and varied and will take you through scenery as diverse as that of the Snowy Mountains, the exhilarating coastal stretch and the fabulous outback. If you take the time beforehand to map out a proper itinerary, you’ll get the most out of your visit to this incomparably beautiful region of Australia.
Mungo National Park. Photo credit: Destination NSW.
If you base yourself in Sydney you can take out a cheap car rental to enjoy the famous coastal drive between here and Melbourne. This will take you ultimately to the border with Victoria and on the way you’ll pass a string of historic villages and quaint seaside towns and attractive bays to stop off at for refreshments and a dip in the clear waters. There are also more than 30 national parks along the route, along with spectacular wildlife reserves, making this a drive full of new experiences. Some of the finest dairy cheeses in Australia are made in this area, and wineries too are never far distant, with eating out one of the many pleasures of the trip.
Wollongong Harbour. Photo credit: Destination NSW.
Or try the Grand Pacific Drive out of Sydney, which takes you straight through the Royal National Park and along the Sea Cliff Bridge, curving out beneath the Illawarra Escarpment for some fabulous views. You can stop off for cheap and fresh fish ‘n’ chips at Wollongong Harbour and watch the sea blast up through the natural blowhole at Kiama along the way.
Blue Mountains. Photo credit: Destination NSW.
There’s also a popular road trip to the west of Sydney that takes you over the Blue Mountains and right across the central western plains. There is a sense of endless space here and you can almost feel the spirit of the outback. Alternatively, opt for the slower but much more scenic and less-traveled route across the mountains, the so-called Bells Line of Road trip, and relax with coffee and lunch with a stopover at the Mount Tomah Botanic Garden.
Coastal walking. Photo credit: Greater Port Macquarie Visitor Information Centre.
The drive between Sydney and Port Macquarie will take a leisurely five hours. You can head off the Pacific Highway just a little beyond Raymond Terrace and you’ll soon find yourself in the Buckett’s Way region of hair-bend turns and rolling hills. This country is a lot rougher than those of the other routes; with many of the roads being little more than dirt tracks. Stop off at the quaint little township of Stroud, which was largely built by convicts in the early 19th century. There are plenty of arts and crafts stores here and at nearby Gloucester and Tininee.

the U.K. “embrace the transition to open access, and accelerate the process in a measured way which promotes innovation but also what is most valuable in the research communication ecosystem.”
The model it suggests is mixed, but heavily weighted toward the “gold” model, or publication in Open Access (OA) journals funded by article processing charges, temporarily supported by extended licenses for subscription journals during the transition, and backstopped by repositories with a focus on preservation and access to “grey”, or non-commercially published, literature. “It is unlikely that either institutional or subject-based repositories could by themselves provide a satisfactory model for a research communications system,” the report says. “[…] Quality assurance through peer review, coupled with the wide range of discovery, navigation, linking and related services provided by publishers and other intermediaries are […] of critical importance.”
The report estimated that the cost of the transition would be an additional 50-60 million pounds per year: 38 million on publishing in open access journals, 10 million on extensions to licenses for the higher education and health sectors, and 3-5 million pounds on repositories, plus one-off transition costs of 5 million pounds.
Although the report focuses on U.K. policy, David Willetts, minister for universities and science, was quoted by The Guardian as saying, .”
Research Libraries U.K. (RLUK) generally welcomed the report, particularly the estimates of cost savings, but took issue with the 12 month embargo period it proposed. David Prosser, executive director of RLUK, said in a statement, “RLUK therefore strongly supports the recent OA proposals from the RCUK which incorporate a maximum embargo of six months for scientific research and sees no merit in the excessive embargoes suggested by the Finch Report.” (The Publishers Association, on the other hand, particularly welcomed the embargo recommendation, while praising the report in general; the association recently released a report claiming that a six month embargo period would cut journal subscriptions by almost half.)
In addition to academic libraries, the report is of particular interest to public libraries because of a proposal to provide walk-in access to the majority of journals via public libraries across the U.K., something the report says “should be pursued with vigor, along with an effective publicity and marketing campaign.”
The public library initiative is proposed to run for an initial two year trial to gather and analyze data on demand and usage. “Publishers hope to extend the service at the end of the two years if it has not led to any damaging loss of core revenues,” the Finch report says, noting, “the precise terms of what will be provided – whether access will be restricted to screens on library equipment, restrictions on copying to other devices, access to printing, and related matters – and issues such as discover-ability and whether access will be provided to all content via a single platform, have yet to be worked out. A working group of representatives of public libraries and of publishers has been established to consider these issues, and how the proposal can be implemented to best effect.”

FINCH REPORT, A TROJAN HORSE, SERVES PUBLISHING INDUSTRY INTERESTS INSTEAD OF UK RESEARCH INTERESTS
1..
THE FINCH FIASCO IN FACTS AND FIGURES
The Finch Report, under strong and palpable influence from the publishing lobby, instead of recommending extending and optimizing the UK’s worldwide lead in providing Green OA, cost-free, through institutional and funder self-archiving mandates, has recommended abandoning Green OA and Green OA mandates and instead spending extra money (£50-60 million yearly) on paying publishers’ Gold OA fees as well as a UK blanket national site-license fee to cover whatever is not yet Gold OA (i.e., all the journals that UK institutions currently subscribe to, rather like the “Big Deals” publishers have been successfully negotiating with individual institutions and consortia):
Finch on Green: “The [Green OA] policies of neither research funders nor universities themselves have yet had a major effect in ensuring that researchers make their publications accessible in institutional repositories… [so] the infrastructure of subject and institutional repositories should [instead] be developed [to] play a valuable role complementary to formal publishing, particularly in providing access to research data and to grey literature, and in digital preservation [no mention of Green OA]…”
Finch on Gold: “Gold” open access, funded by article charges, should be seen as “the main vehicle for the publication of research”… Public funders should establish “more effective and flexible arrangements” to pay [Gold OA] article charges… During the transition to [Gold] open access, funding should be found to extend licences [subscriptions] for non-open-access content to the whole UK higher education and health sectors…
Now here are some of the actual figures behind the above assertions. Let readers come to their own conclusions about the relative success, cost, benefits, cost-effectiveness, growth potential and timetable of mandating Green OA vs funding Gold OA: bit.ly/FinchFiasco

Central America: Northern Triangle countries are being militarizedFriday, December 16th, 2011
Repressive strategies led by former soldiers are the new norm in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador
[Translation of an article from ContraPunto of San Salvador for December 14. See original here and related articles here, here and here.]
By Gerardo Arbaiza
The Central American Northern Triangle, consisting of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, has been found in several studies to be the most violent region of the world not involved in an armed conflict.
According to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Honduras is in first place in the world in homicides, with a rate of 78 for every 100,000 inhabitants, followed by El Salvador with 66 and, three levels below, Guatemala, with a total of 41 murders per 100,000 inhabitants.
The World Health Organization considers a country to be in an epidemic when the rate of deaths from any cause reaches ten for every 100,000 inhabitants.
The strategy these countries have adopted recently to reduce these figures is directed at taking members of the armed forces and using them together with police forces for tasks of citizen security. (more…)

(Aug 17, 2011) On August 11, 2011, the European Commission allowed Spain to temporarily restrict the access of Romanian workers to its labor market. (2011/503/EU: Commission Decision of 11 August 2011 Authorising Spain to Temporarily Suspend the Application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Freedom of Movement for Workers Within the Union with Regard to Romanian Workers [hereinafter Commission Decision], OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (OJ) (L207) 22 (Aug. 12, 2011).) The decision involves one of the four fundamental pillars of the European Union, that is, the free movement of people within the territory of the 27 EU Member States and the right of the EU Member States to curtail such freedom of movement on certain grounds. This right of free movement – which in general permits workers to look for employment in another Member State without a work permit and also to reside there – is protected in articles 45 and 46 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (See consolidated version of the Treaty, OJ (C83) 47-199 (Mar. 30, 2010).)
This right is furthermore provided in Regulation No. 492/2011, adopted in April 2011, which replaces the 1968 Regulation on Freedom of Movement of Workers Within the Union and establishes the requirements and conditions of the exercise of the right of free movement. (Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on Freedom of Movement for Workers Within the Union [hereinafter the Regulation], OJ 2011 (L14) 11 (May 27, 2011).)
Based on articles 1-6 of the Regulation, nationals of a Member State, regardless of place of residence, have the right to seek employment in another EU Member State, without being subject to discrimination and with the same priority as nationals of that state. EU Member States are not permitted to restrict this right by law, regulation, or administrative action or to impose requirements not applicable to their own nationals. (Id.)
The Act of Accession to the EU for Romania, adopted in 2005, established transitional provisions for workers. Romania eventually joined the EU on January 1, 2007. EU Members had the right to defer full access to their labor markets by Romanian workers for a seven-year period, to 2014. The Act of Accession also contained a "safeguard clause" that gave EU Members the right to re-introduce restrictions, if that Member were experiencing or anticipating serious "labor market disturbances." (Press Release, The Commission Accepts That Spain Can Temporarily Restrict the Free Movement of Romanian Workers, MEMO/11/554 (Aug. 11, 2011), EUROPA.)
Currently, Romanian workers have access to the labor market in 15 of the 25 EU Member States other than Spain and Romania (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Sweden). The other EU Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) still maintain work permits for such workers, with some adjustments. (Id.)
Spain opened its market to Romanian workers on January 1, 2009. However, following the global economic downturn of 2008, Spain began experiencing serious disturbances in its labor market, especially an unemployment rate in excess of 20%. (Commission Decision, supra.)
On July 22, 2011, Spain notified the European Commission of its decision to take immediate measures to reintroduce restrictions because of its domestic economic crisis. In connection with this crisis, on July 28, 2011, Spain requested that, with regard to Romanian workers, the Commission suspend articles 1-6 of the Regulation. (Id.)
The Commission Decision adopted on August 11 authorizes Spain to temporarily suspend the application of articles 1-6 of the Regulation until December 31, 2012. (Id.) The Commission based its decision on an analysis of economic data indicating that Spain was facing a serious labor market disturbance that was reflected in its having the highest unemployment rate across the EU, "particularly dramatic unemployment among youth and a slow economic recovery." (Id.) The decision does not affect Romanian workers who are already employed in Spain and those who are registered as job seekers by the Public Employment Services in Spain. (Id.)

Logan Utah Mortgages - What do I need to qualify for a mortgage?
if you watch television, listen to the radio, read the newspaper, or have a pulse, you've probably heard that it is much harder to qualify for a mortgage than it used to be. This is true but not because the principles of lending have changed. To qualify for a mortgage, a borrower has always needed a credit score, a job, and money in the bank. Today, They still have to have a credit score, a job, and money in the bank, but the standards are higher and the way that lenders are verifying this information has changed. For example, with respect to...
*Credit Scores: In the past, a 680 credit score was considered good enough to claim the very best interest rates. Now, 740 is the new 680. Anything less than 740 and the borrower will be paying a higher interest rate. (unless they have a lower than average loan to value)
*Employment: Some lenders use to offer "stated income loans" where the borrower's income didn't need to be verified with paystubs or W2's. With stated income loans a thing of the past, borrowers will need to provide, at a minimum, their last 2 pay stubs and their tax returns and W2's for the past 2 years. Also, borrowers need to have had steady employment for 2 years without any unexplained gaps. If they are employed part-time, they must have had the same job for 2 years before they can use that income on a job application.
*Assets: Lenders are requiring borrowers' last 2 months bank statements to verify any money that they will be using for a down payment, and/or to show reserves. Also, they require a letter of explanation for all large deposits that are not from their employer. They do this to assure that the borrower is not taking out a loan for the downpayment.
It's important to know what to expect when shopping for a mortgage. Although the standards are higher, the principles have not changed, and I believe that the majority of borrowers that qualified a year or 2 years ago, would still qualify today. With rates at historic lows, the $8,000 tax credit, and plenty of homes to choose from, it is an amazing time to purchase a home.

A good article from Janine Popick,
President and CEO - Founder of Vertical Response Marketing that landed in my inbox this morning.
Well, it's the end of the year and you're not only sending a ton of email but you're getting it too, right? Retailers are going nuts trying to get as much as they can out of the short season. I'm seeing an email every 30 seconds pop into my inbox and I'm sure many of you have it just the same. Bloomie's and Nieman Marcus are up to 2-3 mailings a DAY right now, but they mail every day anyway, so that's not completely out of the ordinary. On top of that, the businesses who market to businesses are feeling the end-of-year crunch so they're having fire sales for their goods and services too.
What really got me this year was the sheer number of retailers I've purchased from last year, that didn't send me one email until November. Now by inbox runneth over with emails from them.
Where's the Respect?
Bounce rates are likely to be higher due to the amount of people that had a change of email address. Think of the many people who've unfortunately lost their jobs this past year. If you're not giving them something of value and keeping in touch with them throughout the year, they probably won't give you their updated email addresses.
Response rates might be lower because it's been so long since recipients have been communicated to. In fact, like me, recipients might feel "used and abused" because businesses are only giving them great deals when THEY need them the most, not when recipients need the deals most. Remember, it's a two way street. You both are giving and taking.
On top of response rates being low unsubscribe rates could soar. If recipients are all of a sudden getting slammed by your emails when they've not heard from you, they're more likely to unsubscribe.
So here's to 2009, we all need to look at our marketing dollars under a microscope. The people that are going to get you through any tough times are your customers. So make sure you don't abuse them, and make sure you build a lasting relationship with them all year long.

DOE INTENDS TO EXTEND LOCKHEED MARTIN'S MANAGEMENT CONTRACT FOR SANDIA
ALBUQUERQUE, NM, December 13th, 2002 -- Sandia National Laboratories President and Director C. Paul Robinson said today the Department of Energy's intent to extend Lockheed Martin Corporation's management contract for Sandia provides continuity for Sandia and will benefit the nation. "This is very welcome news. It is good to know that we will not face the distractions of a contract competition at this time of critical national challenge, and the possibility of disruption in the management and culture of the laboratories," Robinson said.
Robinson's comments came after DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham announced during a visit to Sandia that the department is renewing Lockheed Martin Corporation's management contract for Sandia for another five years. The new contract will take effect Oct. 1, 2003, and be in place until Sept. 30, 2008. Lockheed Martin Corporation's current management contract began Oct. 1, 1993.
"I am delighted with the announcement that Secretary Abraham made today - that he intends to extend the contract for Lockheed Martin to manage and operate Sandia," Robinson said. "Lockheed Martin has proved to be a conscientious and wise corporate parent as well as an outstanding corporate citizen. They have created a world-class board of directors here, and have demonstrated a strong commitment to our community.
"Today's announcement is just as important to the people of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Livermore, California, as it is to the folks who work here at Sandia National Laboratories."
Under Lockheed Martin Corporation's management, Sandia has consistently received outstanding performance ratings from the DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration.

FarmVille login issues are common and generally related to Facebook login issues. FarmVille as a standalone application on the Facebook platform does not have a unique login for its service. The best way to log in to FarmVille is to first log in to Facebook then navigate via your apps to the FarmVille icon and start playing your game. Access the FarmVille login via the Facebook page.
Background
FarmVille is one of the most popular online games in the entire world! FarmVille is a leader in social gaming, meaning that the game is played wholly on Facebook and users interact on the Facebook platform to play the game. Zynga is the publisher and developer of FarmVille and is based our of San Francisco, CA. Zynga was founded by Mark Pincus, an outspoken entrepreneur which a flair for making flashy moves. FarmVille is the most popular Zynga title but has recently been eclipsed by CityVille, another Zynga title.
Competitors
FarmVille has a ton of competitors, including other Zynga games like CityVille and FrontierVille. Other publishers with games that compete with FarmVille are Playdom, Playfish, and Kabam, which makes strategy games. Overall, FarmVille is one of the top games on Facebook and will likely remain so unless user habits change.
Common Issues
The most common issue with FarmVille is finding the FarmVille login inside Facebook. The solution is actually fairly simple and just involves navigating to the apps portion of the lefthand navigation bar in the Facebook interface. They you can easily click on FarmVille to log in to the service.
FarmVille login issues and interruptions can be caused by having an out-of-date version of Flash, the technology that powers FarmVille graphics. Flash is a browser-based application runtime that power a ton of rich internet applications like FarmVille. Download Flash to resolve any FarmVille issues related to Adobe Flash.
FarmVille Statistics
FarmVille has over 46 million monthly active users (MAU), meaning that over 46 million unique Facebook users log into FarmVille every thirty days! From a daily active user perspective, FarmVille has only 12 million daily active users (DAU), meaning that in the last day only 12 million users logged into FarmVille. See below for a chart that shows that daily active user trend for April/May for FarmVille logins.
Zynga is the behemoth social gaming company behind FarmVille, with a ton of other titles like CityVille. Over the past year, Zynga login traffic to their website has increased dramatically as users attempt to login to key games like FarmVille, which is their 2nd largest game after CityVille.
ScamVille Controversy
In October of 2009, Michael Arrington lambasted Zynga and FarmVille for what he termed, “The social gaming ecosystem of hell” aka ScamVille. Arrington criticizes FarmVille for offering incentivized downloads for partner apps and services in an attempt to drive customer acquisition. The bulk of his fury was leveled against ringtone offers that rebill customers without their consent.

Marriage & Civil Partnerships
American citizens coming to the United Kingdom to marry British citizens or persons settled here, or to register as Civil Partners, generally require entry clearance from UK authorities. Clearance must be obtained in advance of arrival.
If you are in the United States and need more information, consult the website of the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., at. If you are outside the United States, but not in the United Kingdom, consult. If you are already in the United Kingdom, see.
Failure to comply with the requirement for entry clearance may result in refusal of entry to the United Kingdom.
Civil (Non-Religious) Marriages
In general, for a civil marriage, both contracting parties must:
- observe the statutory residence requirements (see below);
- be at least 16 years old;
- obtain parental consent in writing if either party is under age 18, unless one is a widow or widower;
- if previously married, produce evidence that they are currently free to marry (for example, the original or a certified copy of the former spouse's death certificate or of the divorce decree); and
- arrange for two witnesses to be present at the marriage and to sign the Marriage Register.
People subject to immigration control who wish to marry in the United Kingdom must:
- hold entry clearance as a fiancé/e or marriage visitor, or
- hold a Home Office certificate of approval, or
- be a person with settled status in the United Kingdom (e.g. indefinite leave to remain).
Who regulates civil marriages in England and Wales?
The Registrar's Office for each district. To find the nearest Registrar, look under "Registration of Births, Deaths, and Marriages" in the telephone directory, or call Directory Assistance (192). The Registrar takes the Notice of Marriage (the license application), issues the certificate, and conducts the ceremony. For most visiting Americans, the most centrally located Registrar's Office is at Westminster Council House, Marylebone Road, London SW1E 6QP (Tel: 020-7641-1161).
How do I obtain a certificate?
There is a seven-day residence requirement for both parties; on the eighth day, both give "Notice of Intent to Marry" to the local Registrar's Office for the district in which they have been staying. A further 15-day waiting period must lapse before the marriage may take place. It is preferable that both parties give notice at the same time. Each party also is required to declare nationality and provide evidence of identification.
Religious marriages in England and Wales
Church of England authorities advise that marriage in an Anglican church between two foreigners or between a foreigner and a British citizen should be by ecclesiastical license arranged through the vicar of the church in which they wish to be married. For information on marriage in accordance with Anglican rites, consult The Faculty Office, 1 The Sanctuary, London SW1P 3JS (Tel: 020-7222-5381). Protestants of other denominations or Quakers should consult the clergyman or governing body of the respective denomination. Roman Catholic authorities advise that parties should give at least six weeks' notice to the parish priest prior to the marriage to allow time for instruction, collection of documents, publication of banns, and other formalities. If the parties do not reside in the parish, they will need letters from the parish priests of their home parishes giving permission for the celebration of the marriage elsewhere. Jewish marriages may be performed under the auspices of a registered synagogue and entered in the synagogue's marriage register. Further information may be obtained from the Office of the Chief Rabbi, 735 High Road, London N12 0US (Tel: 020-8343-8989). For religions not mentioned, please contact the appropriate governing authority.
Can a marriage take place anywhere?
Marriages can be performed by a Registrar at any location, provided the venue is licensed, approved, and registered for the purpose of marriage by the local government authority. Licensed venues may include hotels, public houses, and stately homes. For a fee, the Registrar from the district where you reside may perform the marriage in another district's licensed venue. Fees vary according to the time and date you wish the marriage to take place. For a list of venues and fees, contact the nearest Registrar.
Is a marriage performed in the United Kingdom valid in the United States?
In general, regardless of the nationality or religion of the persons married, marriages legally performed in the United Kingdom are also legally valid in the United States.
What is the role of the Embassy?
The Embassy has no role in the process, other than to administer oaths on documents as a notary service. American diplomatic and consular officers may not perform marriages or serve as witnesses. Marriages may not take place at the Embassy.
Is citizenship affected by marriage?
No. An American citizen marrying a foreign national does not lose American citizenship, nor does he/she automatically acquire British citizenship if marrying a British citizen. Similarly, a foreign national does NOT acquire American citizenship simply by marriage to an American citizen. After marriage, an American citizen may amend his/her surname to reflect his/her married name by presenting his/her U.S. passport and a certified copy of the marriage certificate to a consular official at the Embassy. For more information, see our passports information pages. A foreign national spouse who intends to reside in the United States must obtain a U.S. immigrant visa prior to entering the United States.
Civil Partnerships
The UK Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into operation on December 5, 2005, and enables a same-sex couple to register as civil partners of each other. A civil partnership can be registered in England and Wales in a register office or in approved premises. For more information, see. Note that, as for marriage, entry clearance must be obtained in advance of arrival from UK authorities. Please refer to the links above.
Under U.S. law (the Defense of Marriage Act 1996), a civil partnership registration cannot be used as the basis for an immediate name change in a U.S. passport, nor can it be used as the basis for a U.S. immigration benefit. For more information related to immigration, see the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service website.

Colorado vacation day 1 - July 10
[We'll slide into recounting the whole vacation trip slowly, so as not to build the excitement levels (or envy) too fast. We'll just let my jotted notes out of my trip journal start us off. I have only edited them by adding punctuation or paragraph marks where needed.]
Left JC @ 5:00 AM (CDT). Arrived at Mike's @ 5:00 PM (MDT). Drove through heavy (frightening) rain & lightning in MO from Boonville to about Oak Grove - other than that the drive was uneventful.
Welcome to Colorful Colorado!
Mike & Ginger live way up in the mountains above Golden!
Mike & Ginger's house
Looking toward Gray's & Torrey's Peaks from la Casa Slinkard
Truck is packed & ready - we are planning to leave @ 4:30 AM.
My truck - Pike's Peak is in the far distance if you know where to look and what you're looking for
Stay tuned for more to come!

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — The group that oversees film permits for Los Angeles shoots reported an overall drop in film and television production this year.
According to FilmL.A., on-location shooting dropped nearly 4 percent between July and September compared to the same time in 2011.
Permit production days for TV dramas decreased 18.5 percent and fell 20.5 percent for reality TV.
While the television category was off 1.4 percent, TV sitcom production jumped 47.6 percent.
“The television landscape is changing in Los Angeles, and economically, the sector has taken a turn for the worse,” said FilmL.A. President Paul Audley. “Many of the new TV projects we’re coordinating permits for have low spending and employment impacts.”
Feature film production also dropped 21.1 percent.

2. How did Beatport come to account for this much of the pie?
3. Is that really a good thing?
I may go into more detail on this later, but for now a few thoughts…
Distributors are a bit of a relic from the days of having to physically get your records into hundreds of stores around the globe. They are useful online if you want to make sure your track is in all the online stores, but if you only sell a handful of copies from those stores is it worth the 10-15% cut they take? They now also serve a purpose to the stores with the ever increasing number of labels – in the case of Beatport many smaller labels are grouped together so that Beatport just deals with the distributor rather than the individual label (the labels have no designated contact at Beatport).
I think Beatport had two things going for it: design and exclusivity. Of all the music sites it is by far the best designed user interface, and for this reason i found myself returning there even though tracks cost more. The second, and most important, point is exclusivity deals. Busy DJs want to go record shopping once a week, not several times at several locations, this is why so few sales go direct through label’s websites. Once key labels gave Beatport exclusivity that meant DJs would head there by default so that they could get all the latest tracks in one place. This factor seems to even trump audio player seen as Beatport’s 2min sample is the most basic these days. I actually think they’ve consciously done that - how many times have you listened to a track and it cuts just before the drop? That leaves the listener at peak anticipation and more likely to hit the buy button.
Finally, is Beatport’s pie-hogging a good thing? I dont think so. Dont get me wrong, I like Beatport, but I dont like monopolies. And as online record stores crumble around us there is something disconcerting about virtually all sales going through one store. Beatport’s margins are pretty high already meaning less money for the label and for the artist (artists generally see about 20p of each track sold unless you’re selling large volumes and can negotiate). I think Beatport is still working on an old model based on the physical record store. I think there is a better way of getting music to the DJs, putting the quality labels in the foreground and rewarding the artists. I’m still developing the idea, but I think it will be soon time for a change.
Ok, time to stop talking and start listening. Here is a gorgeous mix of classic house and nu-disco sounds by the man who brought us Coma Cat… Tensnake. Enjoy it. 43m25s particularly tickles my loins, what a groove!

Falling.
Falling in Reverse have built a strong following in the brief time they have been a band. And tonight they will be introduced to a whole new wave of potential fans when they open for Guns N’ Roses. “I’m losing my mind. I don’t know. I’m so nervous right now. I’m like shaking,” vocalist Ronnie Radke admits to KROQ. “I’ve played a lot of shows in front of a lot of people, but this is probably the most awesome thing that’s ever happened to me, pretty much, when it comes to playing shows.”
Radke’s mixed emotions aren’t just based on the fact that he’ll essentially be playing to another band’s huge audience — it’s also a big deal for him on a personal level. “My dad played ‘Appetite for Destruction’ on loop when I was a kid. That’s all I heard. “They were the kings of ’80s rock ‘n’ roll and Sunset Strip bands. Classics,” exclaims Radke. “It’s Axl. It’s Axl Rose. It’s Axl Rose, man. I’m ecstatic. That’s all I can say. I’m very happy right now.”
Despite his excitement, Radke is also aware that sometimes opening for a band with a large following can backfire. “I played a radio show with a band called Chevelle and the crowd hated us … Maybe some of our fans are there? I’m going into this blind. I have no idea. I’m just completely baffled right now.”
Radke and FIR guitarist Jacky Vincent recently stopped by Loudwire’s offices. Check back soon for our full interview, as well as an exclusive performance by Vincent.

We’re reading through my old Narnia books with the girls. Liv’s been through many of them once before. Elise hasn’t heard them yet, and it seems that she isn’t really ready yet. She got to the end of the book and still thought that Uncle Andrew was a good guy.
Olivia, on the other hand, was hanging on every detail. She bounded out of her bed with excitement when Strawberry became Fledge and grew wings. She hid under her covers when the Witch snuck by them in the mountain range. And she was finally able to sleep soundly when the book came to an end and all the loose ends were properly tied.
As always it was a joy to read these books as an adult. It seems that each time I go through them they strike a new chord with me. This time I felt for the little Digory as he worried for his mother. I was reminded of how real troubles are for our kids. They suffer their worries, and know that there is nothing they can do as they are just powerless little children.
I think Liv is bursting at the seams to start The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. She’ll remember a lot from the last time. But I can’t wait to see what details grab her this trip through.

Posted by lpearle on 8 February 2010
A while ago I wrote about destination fatigue; I’ve been thinking about this more and more, particularly after a conversation I had with a friend this past weekend. My friend teaches graphic design at a SUNY not far from where I live, and we were talking about preparing students for the World Out There. Their ideas of appropriate dress and behavior are different from ours but those are the things that can be changed and molded. What’s more difficult is their ideas of privacy and how best to work.
In this day of Augmented Reality and games like Foursquare, with Facebook’s creator deciding that privacy is not important, how do we teach students to create a private space? How do we let them know that not sharing everything has value – it’s not just about mystery, it’s about preserving a sense of self in a world where we’re increasingly nakedly “out there”. Will there be a backlash, a move to going off the grid?
As for the way in which they work, they’ve been told that their generation has mastered the art of multitasking (or continuous partial attention). They’ve had expectations lowered and distractions raised so that working on one thing, mindfully, is a novel idea. How many of my students watch tv and do homework and text and listen to their iPod at the same time? I’d venture a guess that it’s quite a lot of them.
I’m guilty, too. I feel compelled to keep up professionally, so at night I read my RSS feeds and try to catch up on the links being shared on twitter and look at the elists to which I’m subscribed; all that takes about around 3 hours a night. For me to accomplish all that, I have to watch tv at the same time – otherwise, I won’t be able to spend time reading before bed. It’s difficult for me to concentrate on the tv AND the professional ‘keeping up’ at the same time, so neither get done particularly well.
I think back to my life before I became a librarian, when work was 9-5 and that was it; my evenings and weekends were my own. There wasn’t a need to carve out “me” time because that was abundant. I didn’t feel guilty about not attending the Knowledge Building Center seminar tonight. I didn’t have a sense of panic about not doing the right thing by my students and school because I was missing something that could help them in their search for academic success. Getting an invitation to become part of the New Media Literacies site shouldn’t make me resent opening my e-mail.
What I need – what we all need – is to stop time a little. To really think about what’s more important, ourselves or everyone else, and to find a way to balance that. All this overwhelm and scrambling to keep up just means that something is getting left behind; I’d rather it not be my life, or yours.

Dunes and a beautiful delta in Lake Eyre.
Like some other bloggers I know, I can't resist pointing to yet another image from NASA's Earth Observatory site. This one if of Australia's Lake Eyre basin.
Just go read the description there. In how many places do we see a delta system and sand dunes cutting through one other?
And an amazing ecosystem to boot--see the Australian Broadcasting Corp. video (referenced by the EO site) here.

A wonderful book on water lifting devices.
Water Lifting Devices, by P.L. Fraenkel and Jeremy Thake.
My wife Kate loves libraries, and on one of our recent trips to the newly remodeled Morris Library at SIUC, I happened to spot this book. I've done innumerable internet searches on pumps and related technology for our river model development, but had never seen this one. Score another one for books on shelves.
The book's aim is a review of applied pumping theory and practice, and description of pumps suitable for, mostly, third world applications. It's amazingly comprehensive, with wonderful sections on theory and pump efficiency--even covering generation of electricity using wind, hydro, and biogas.
Pumping is a difficult topic. This book does an admirable job of making it accessible.
If you work with pumps or fluid mechanics, or are interested in mechanical devices (and their history) you'll enjoy this book. Many of the technologies described, such as the Archimedes Screw, are centuries old and most rely on human or animal power.
You can find the most recent version (3rd edition, 2007) on Amazon.com here, and it seems the UN-FAO has an older online version with a linked table of contents here. Both are richly illustrated.
I also found a wonderful collection of photographs covering this topic by Thorkild Schiöler here. A photo from this site, of a Chinese "dragons's spine" pump powered by three treaders, is shown below.

An "inland hurricane" hits Carbondale.
In Illinois, the damage covers several counties, and we're told Carbondale took the brunt of it. Hardly a home stands undamaged. I counted over 30 trees destroyed on the 3-acre lot my in-laws own.
A 36-inch red oak came down on the back of our building, giving us quite a shock. Like many huge old oaks that were destroyed, it was simply uprooted. Constant rain over the last two weeks left soils saturated, and many healthy trees were destroyed this way. Bad luck.
We just regained power the Internet connection today, though many of us will be without power for several days at home.
Top image is the NOAA Radar, which I captured an hour or so before the winds hit us.
Update: Radar imagery from the University of Wisconsin. A week after the storm, many thousands of homes (including mine) are still without power, and Carbondale estimates over 3,000 trees came down in the City.

Grade control Part 1.
I've been working on an incised urban channel needing grade control, and took the opportunity to review what's out there, and also my own thick files. Here I'll talk a bit about theory, practice, and the politics of using grade control in channel management.
First, a skydiver. On leaving the plane he has huge potential energy relative to the ground thousands of feet below. After opening his chute, he slowly dissipates that energy by converting it to kinetic energy using a parachute.
Water works the same way. Especially in urban channels, I use this simple conceptual approach: We have a certain volume of water entering our area of interest at a certain elevation. As this flow moves down the channel, potential energy (from the elevation difference) is converted to kinetic energy and dissipated. How that conversion and dissipation happens largely controls channel erosion and sediment transport.
Grade control structures are a way to manage this. At the top of this figure we see a smooth channel. Conversion of potential (PE) to kinetic energy (KE) is more or less evenly distributed throughout the reach. Below we've added grade controls. What's important here is that we now see 1) most of the energy is now dissipated only at discreet locations (the GC structures) and 2) we pick and armor those locations.
Pretty simple. And it works. In theory, you don't have to armor the channel between these structures. One of the many things about river mechanics that is counterintuitive to most people.

Em2 models on a map.
View Emriver Em2 models in a larger map
We've been busy shipping Em2 models this month--it seems the economy is recovering, or at least agency budgets are moving past last fall's severe cuts.
So we took some time to map the locations of our Em2 models. It's a nice feeling to see the impact we're having. Some of the locations have several models; Winona State has six Em2's (and an Em4).

Guys I need some advise on what H/C setup to go with on the Z. It's between LG and TSP. The LG setup will be the AFR 205's milled to 59cc and the G5X3 cam. TSP haven't quit made up my mind on what to go with. Any body running any of their h/c combo on a ZO6? I would like to make a least 450rwhp, will the stock injectors be enough? Going with the AFR set up is more $$$, will it be worth it? If I go with AFR's I will need to hold off on a fast intake and keep the LS6, can the stock intake get me to 450? Also what about the stock clutch will it hold up for a while?

I have a 2001 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 Roller in great condition. It has 66k miles on the chasse. It's red w/ ebony interior. I've had the car for about 2 years now but I need to get rid of it ASAP. The motor, transmission, rearend are in the car now. I will pull the motor out once I find a buyer, unless the buyer would like to take the car with the engine at an additional cost. The car is sitting on 10 spoke silver snow flake rims. It will need a new set of tires for the rims. Other than that this car is in excellent shape.

Thanks, MSM! Another cleverly executed cover-up job for His Majesty. Your fall guy is in place, and all that´s left for you is accusing anyone who doesn´t believe the cascade of White House lies a racist and/or conspiracy nut. Oh, and by the way, MSM - the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.
I don´t care who hit the delete-button on Al-Quaida. I want to know who inserted the "it was the video" meme.
I believe clapper is the ONLY one under oath who said he did not order a stand down. Perfect match for the legal show the dems are eager to put on thus further distracting the deaf,dumb and blind public from the story of a group of people slaughtered while our potus watched and did nothing.
I suspect that this administration is going to lay this at Petraeus´ feet.He can rise up again and hurt them since most Americans seem to love an adulterer.
There are still four dead Americans and this administration will not tell us why our Ambassador was in Benghazi with minimal security. The answer to that will explain everything.
Why don´t we start calling it "The Black House?"
Duh, Obama will "hang" this on somebody. In fact he spends more time blaming everyone else, when he alone is responsible. Anyone who works with him or for him should know that Obama will blame them for his dissasstrous mistakes and deluded thinking. Why are there never any consequences for this president and the democrats?
#7--that´s what Islamists and Al Qa´ida already refer to is as, The Black House.
FTA: As Senator John McCain explained: “It is the worst cover-up or incompetence I have ever observed in my life. Somebody the other day said to me, This is as bad as Watergate, [but] nobody died in Watergate.”The Republicans need to keep up this drum beat regardless of the smears by the Dems who are trying to make it appear to be racism and sexism. McCain doesn´t have to worry about running for President again.All complaints of racism and sexism have worn thin, and it will continue to become more wearisome as time goes by.The people who are crying racism regarding what McCain said about Susan Rice are showing what fools they are. Incompetence doesn´t have a skin or gender designation. I know we have a lot of morons right now, but sooner or later even those uncommitted morons are going to scratch their heads and "say what?"If the Congressional Black Caucasians (Rush´s name for the CBC) keep crying wolf, all they are doing is making themselves look even more stupid than they normally appear. They only care about their own constituents, though, so it won´t matter to them.#7´s new designation for the Executive Mansion in DC is perfect!
Obama: Commander-in-Chief. m´k?
Why did Hillary Clinton deny the Benghazi consulate elite armed security in a war torn Islamic nation known as fertile ground for recruiting jihadists?Why isn´t anyone asking that?
For anyone who cares to read it, here is the URL of Zippy´s UN speech in September. A masterpiece of equivocation.
Sorry here´s the URL
0bama = SpadePiaps = GutmanJarrett = O´ShaughnessyAxelrod = Cairo- - and Clapper = Wilmer - - the Fall Guy.Yup - - straight out of the script for "The Maltese Falcon."
Sacrificing an incompetent white man in order to take the heat off an incompetent black woman. The chorus will sing that it was Clapper who made the change and poor, falsely accused Susan Rice DESERVES to be Sec State to make up for her horrible persecution. Oh, the humanity! Slavery! Slavery!Give me a break.Everyone is expected to obediently forget that by the time Rice appeared on the Sunday shows EVERYONE knew that Benghazi was a terrorist attack by an alquaeda affiliate. Either Rice was so out of the loop and insulated that she barely knew what day it was, or she appeared on those shows and deliberately and repeatedly advanced a storyline that she knew was a complete lie. That she was lying to the American people at someone else´s instructions makes her no less of a liar. Clueless or a liar. Rock and a hard place. There is no way out of it. And if she gets off the hook by being clueless, she´s a GREAT candidate for Sec State (???!!!).
Yep fall guy is right on...no way Obie would accept his responsibility...

10 Tips To Avoid The Calorie Monster During Holiday Parties
The Catwoman Workout By Celebrity Trainer Ramona Braganza
Shape up with Ramona’s “3-2-1 Training Method”, which incorporates a blend of cardio, circuit and core training to build lean muscles and say goodbye to belly bulge!
The next 30 to 45 minute blast workout consists of 3 cardio segments, 2 circuits of strength and 1 core element.
-Begin the first cardio segment with 3-5 minutes warm up on the elliptical, bike or jogging in place.
-Follow with 3 rounds of strength exercises that work on three different parts of the body, by doing 3 sets of 15-20 reps and resting for 45 seconds between the sets; for chest do pushups or use the chest press machineat the gym. For legs andbiceps do single leg lunge with bicep curl and as a compound exercise do plié squats or plié jumps.
Plie Jumps: slim and tone your inner thighs and hips , and sculpt your calves.
-Start with your feet wider than shoulder width apart, turning your toes out and bending your knees.
-Extend your arms out to your sides at shoulder height.
-While keeping your arms extended, bend your knees and drop your butt to the floor; then jump into the air. Hit the ground and return to the starting position. When landing try to land gently and keep your knees bent to prevent knee injury.
-Do 15 reps.
-Start your second cardio interval with 10 min of high intensity exercises such as jump rope, running or jumping jacks that get your heart rate up. Even if you don’t have a rope with you, just pretend and continue jumping.
-Follow with 3 rounds of dumbbell reverse flies, (which work the back muscles for good posture), tricep kickbacks or tricep dips great for jiggly arms and shadow boxing exercises to increase endurance and speed. Again, do 15-20 reps of each set with a few seconds of rest between them.
Jab Cross Punches: this type of kickboxing movements executed with weights in your hands, is great for theupper body and for the oblique muscles when you twist your trunk.
-Start with the legs hip width apart and knees slightly bent, holding a 2-5 lb. dumbbell in each hand.
-Hold the hands in a boxing stance at chest level with your palms facing in.
-Twist your torso to the right while extending the left arm to punch; then return to the initial position while keeping your back straight and the core muscles engaged. Twist to the left side and punch with the right arm extended.
-Do 15-20 reps.
-For the last cardio segment, you should do quick, intense movements such as jump ropes followed by 30 seconds of kicks or walking up and down the stairs.
- The core segment is what ends a vigorous workout series. Do 3 abs exercises in a row, such as 15 reps of v-ups, followed by 15 reps bicycle and plank variations.
Plank with hip twists (waist cincher): it works on transverse abdominal muscles, obliques and hips, trimming the waist.
-Start in a plank position on forearms, keeping your hands in line with your elbows and the back straight.
-For an extra challenge, hold the start plank position for 30 sec without arching your back.
-Twist your hips to the left and slowly touch the floor. All this time, keep your elbows still on the floor, rotating just your hips.
-Return to the middle position and then twist to the other side.
-Do 20 reps.
Ramona Braganza’s fitness advice:
-If you do only cardio every time when you go to the gym, you won’t have a great body. She classifies this as one common fitness mistake that women make when they want to reshape their bodies. She says that cardio alone leads to “skinny fat, looking thin but lacking definition”.
-You need to combine your cardio workouts with at least 2 times a week strength workouts such as squats, lunges and pushups to build lean, sexy muscles.
-Don’t take shortcuts when lifting weights: if you take too many breaks between your series and use light weights that you can lift easily, it means that you aren’t working hard enough to challenge your muscles. Your last strength training exercises should be hard enough that you are burned out after the exercises..
Studies have shown that building muscles helps to burn fat faster; in general, a pound of muscle burns 50 to 150 calories per day while 1 pound of stubborn fat only burns 3 calories per day!

Male Nude (Nando), 2009, sanguine and graphite on paper, 14 x 14 1/2 inches
It's been a while since I've drawn a nude, since April of 2007 I think. So it was time, and I was lucky find a model within my circle of friends. Hopefully I can get a few more drawings out of him.
3 comments:
Luis, this is just stunning and shows just how skilled you are at life drawing. I once had professor in college who said that if you can draw the human nude then you can do anything. I hope you know how much I have appreciated this blog of yours, sharing your creative experiences and your very being with all of us. You were one of my first Flickr artist friends and I must thank you for that. Please do more of these wonderful drawings and take good care.
All the best, Robert Hoover
Hello Robert, I thank you and appreciate very much you leaving that comment. It's very rewarding to hear these kinds of things once in a while, especially during times of doubt. Drawing the human figure is something I don't do often due to lack of free models and private space. But I do love drawing the figure. I have yet to paint it since I'm afraid of not doing a good job, but I feel that the time has come for me to do so. Thank you once again and I hope you're doing well and still painting.
Best,
Luis
You're very welcome, we should all help each other when ever possible. You have a lot of talent and we all need to have someone give us encouragement from time to time. You probably checked my Flickr site and saw I am still creating art (it's a big part of who I am) and have my second art exhibit this Friday night in Upstate NY called "Absolutely Abstract". Always fond wishes, Robert

JWoww’s Gets Engaged!!
Jersey Shore star JWoww is going to become a wife!
Her boyfriend Roger Matthews asked her the question last week on a skydiving trip. When they hit the floor after the skydiving he got down on one knee and poped the question.
And she said YES!!
“It happened the middle of last week during filming for season two of Snooki & JWoww. They went skydiving and jumped out of a plane together. After landing safely, Roger shocked her by getting down on one knee and proposing. Of course, she said yes! [The ring] is beautiful! And big.”
If you would like to see Roger asking JWoww the important question you can see it on Season 2 of Snooki and JWoww on MTV:
“The crew took great pains to make sure they weren’t followed by photographers and the footage is being kept tightly under wraps. Everyone will have to wait until Season 2 to see it.”

Thanks Mads glad you enjoyed it. The Springpole Lathe is definitly a teacher of disipline and patience, but once you have it set and going the magic takes place as the shavings commence. This is my only turning experience so far. I have yet to get even up to some more advanced 1700-1800 foot pedal lathes….lol…Of course a powered one would be nice as well. In time I’ll get there. Thanks again!

I have most of the parts ready for a pole lathe, but it will be even more simple.But I think it will be for next summer since it will be a outdoor project.Smiles,Mads

This is a lovely little hotel, inside the old part of town so central to all the interesting stuff, bars,restaurants, museums etc., and the castle only... a short stroll away. Old building, but very well modernised inside. Lift, and a fab shower in our room. Hotel MB only serves breakfast, and there is no bar, but on our last afternoon we discovered a lovely little bar just a bit further up the little cobbled street from the hotel entrance. Half a litre of beer and a good coffee came to €2.80!! Cheapest we found... Free access to Internet in rooms - just ask for a cable. If you need WIFI, you can get a good signal in lobby or on first floor landing. Hotels.com viesis, 02/08/2012

WC Fraud
Examples of WC Fraud
NJ Workers' Compensation Fraud Act
Office of Insurance Fraud Prosecutor
Penalties for Committing WC Fraud
Reporting Fraud
WHAT IS WORKERS' COMPENSATION FRAUD?
Workers' Compensation Fraud occurs when someone knowingly makes a false representation of a material fact to obtain or to deny workers' compensation benefits or to avoid responsibility under the law. Fraud also occurs when an employer misrepresents the amount of payroll or classification of its employees. Failure to maintain the required WC insurance coverage is also a crime.
All of us who live and work in New Jersey pay the price for fraud - in the loss of jobs and profit, lower wages and benefits, and higher costs for services and insurance premiums. It affects workers and employers alike and is committed by workers and employers alike.
A worker commits a fraud
by misrepresenting his / her job status while collecting temporary disability benefits
by filing a claim for an injury that did not occur on or has no relation to the job
by knowingly misrepresenting his / her physical condition to obtain WC benefits
by misrepresenting previous trauma or treatment
An employer commits a fraud
when it misrepresents the amount of payroll or the proper classification of its employees
by failing to obtain workers' compensation insurance coverage. This is in violation of NJSA 34:15-79 and is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $10,000 fine, in addition to substantial civil penalties.
An attorney or health care provider commits a fraud
when they assist an individual in fraudulent schemes, participate in double billing or intentionally billing for services not provided or are unwarranted
WC FRAUD ACT
Workers’ compensation fraud is governed by the NJ Workers' Compensation Statute, N.J.S.A. 34:15-57.4. This statute provides that a criminal violation occurs if a misrepresentation is made for the purpose of wrongfully obtaining benefits or withholding benefits or premiums regarding workers’ compensation. If an individual wrongfully obtains benefits, a Judge of Compensation has discretion to terminate benefits and order the forfeiture of benefits that might otherwise be properly received.
OFFICE OF INSURANCE FRAUD PROSECUTOR
The Office of Insurance Fraud Prosecutor (OIFP), was created in 1998 with the mission to investigate allegations of Medicaid and insurance fraud and to develop case-specific facts and evidence. This allows the State of New Jersey to make a reasoned decision whether and how to proceed in cases involving insurance fraud, especially against those who submit false or inflated claims to private or government insurance providers.
Office of Insurance Fraud Prosecutor website
PENALTIES
Workers' Compensation Employer Fraud NJSA 34:15-57.4
An employer who makes a false or misleading statement, representation or submission, including a misclassification of employees, or engages in a deceptive leasing practice, for the purpose of evading the full payment of benefits or premiums shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.
A person who evades the full payment of premiums pursuant to R.S.34:15-1 et seq. or improperly denies or delays benefits pursuant to R.S.34:15-1 et seq. is liable to pay the sum due and owing plus simple interest and shall be civilly liable to any person injured by the violation for damages and all reasonable costs and attorney fees of the injured person.
Failure to Purchase Required WC Insurance Coverage
NJSA 34:15-120.1(c) NJSA 34:15-79
It is illegal for an employer to not purchase workers' compensation insurance. Failure to purchase the required workers’ compensation insurance coverage is a disorderly persons offense and, if such failure shall be determined to be willful, a crime of the fourth degree.
Civil penalties for failure to provide such coverage are:
-
up to $1,000 for the first twenty days
-
and up to $1,000 for each ten days thereafter
If a judgment is entered by a Judge of Compensation against an uninsured employer, in addition to the judgment amount,
-
an additional $1,000 penalty shall be imposed
-
as well as an assessment of 15% (not to exceed $5,000) of the judgment amount.
-
Civil penalties may be imposed even if the case is not prosecuted criminally. NJSA 34:15-120.1(c)
If successfully prosecuted as an indictable offense, the crime is punishable by up to:
-
18 months in jail
-
a $10,000 fine
-
in addition to civil penalties. (NJSA 34:15-79)
Workers' Compensation Worker Fraud: NJSA 34:15-57.4
A person who purposely or knowingly makes a false or misleading statement for the purpose of wrongfully obtaining benefits shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.
If that person has received benefits.
The Division of Workers' Compensation may also order the immediate termination or denial of benefits with respect to that claim and a forfeiture of all rights of compensation or payments sought with respect to the claim.
Health Care Claims Fraud:
It is illegal to submit a false claim form to an insurance company in order to be paid for health care services which were not received or provided. This is a violation of the NJ Health Care Claims Fraud Act, NJSA 2C:21-4.2 and 2C:21-4.3
-
Punishable by 5 to 10 years in prison if the person submitting the claim is a doctor, chiropractor, dentist, psychologist, nurse, pharmacist, physical therapist, lawyer or other licensed professional and the claim is submitted for professional services. In addition, this person can be required to pay a fine of up to $150,000 or up to 5 times the amount of the claim.
-
A person submitting the claim who is not a doctor, chiropractor, etc., could be sentenced 3 to 5 years in jail for just filing one false claim.

I heart New York
This time two years ago I was arriving in New York City with my eyes wide open. It was my first (and to date, only) visit to the Big Apple, and I must apologise to the native New Yorkers, because …
<|endofexample|>
This is the windmill that was just up the street from where I lived, so I rode by it every day. There’s actually a local brewery and cafe inside it that I unfortunately never got to visit.
My building had an awesome rooftop with a really cool view of the city. This picture really doesn’t do it justice because my camera wasn’t the best quality. I miss this roof a lot.
This is a picture of my building at night. All of the flats had these floor-to-ceiling windows with glass panes of all different colors. It looked really cool at night and during the day — very modern and chic.
We had a mixer at our building where they provided like 30 bottles of wine and a bunch of beer to encourage us to get to know the other international students that we shared that wing of the building with. Some people set up a beer pong table in the hallway on the first floor, and I remember this German girl wearing a pink Yankees hat was dominating the beer pong table all evening. I also remember Allison shoving a bottle of wine under her shirt to bring back to her room so we could guzzle it down before we went out to celebrate her birthday. The rest is history.
This was the view from the window of my flat. It sucked having windows that faced the train tracks because they were SO NOISY. And it was nothing like the train sounds I was used to in Springfield — distant clanking and eerie train whistles. No, no. These trains SQUEALED and SQUEAKED and clattered like you would not believe. But I got used to it, and I definitely miss the full wall of east-facing windows in my flat. I still prefer American train sounds to European ones, though.
Speaking of trains, this is the historically styled train that I took with a bunch of students from my program on a day trip to the beach. I miss riding trains — I wish the Midwest had a train system.
This is the Haarlem train station, which also had a historical style to it. “Haarlem” is a perfect example of one of the nuances of the Dutch language — weird double vowels that American mouths can’t quite handle. I think no matter how many years I studied it and practiced, I would never be able to speak Dutch well. There are too many insane consonant combinations and odd vowel sounds that are nothing like English pronunciations.
I love the beach, so I was really ecstatic about going to the North Sea when I was in Europe. This was my first time on a west coast shore, so I insisted on staying at the beach all day, even after most of the student group had gone back to the city, so that I could see the beach sunset.
A small group of us went to a grocery store and bought some beer (which was exciting in itself, because none of us were 21) and watched the sunset while drinking in the sand. We barely caught the last train back to Amsterdam, but it was so worth it.
Gah! All so beautiful. And sunsets are always worth it. (And booze is usually worth it.)
:)

ST GEORGE ILLAWARRA's fruitless search for a long-term halfback has hit another snag, with Roosters boss Stephen Noyce formally blocking their move for Mitchell Pearce.
After missing out on Cooper Cronk in March, the Herald understands the Dragons made an all-out bid to lure Pearce to the Red V next season, a year before his contract with the Roosters expired.
But Noyce rejected claims Pearce would be leaving the Bondi Junction club when contacted yesterday.
''Speculation and rumours aren't good things to comment on - Mitchell's here for this year and next year and we look forward to him fulfilling that contract, and many more years and many more contracts after that,'' Noyce said.
Asked whether he still believed Pearce was future captain material, Noyce said, ''Oh, definitely''.
''We enjoy having Mitchell at our club, and certainly the plans are that he'll be very much a part of the exciting future of the Roosters this year, next year and beyond.''
The Dragons are eager to settle on a long-term pivot to succeed captain Ben Hornby, but a lack of quality halves on the open market has them going around in circles.
Noyce's St George-Illawarra counterpart, Peter Doust, did not return calls yesterday.
Pearce's manager, Mike Newton, said he would wait until the outcome of the NRL's broadcast rights deal before taking up the matter.
''I haven't spoken to anyone,'' Newton said. ''He's under contract next year … I'm not looking at it until we know the lay of the land in regards to the salary cap and everything else.
''We won't know that until the end of the year and I won't be talking to anyone before November 1 [when the official bidding contest for 2014 gets under way] in any case.''
The cap will rise from $4.3 million per club to at least $5 million next season thanks to the anticipated $1 billion-plus rights deal. Players such as Pearce, whose current value hovers at about $650,000 a season, could score big pay rises.
Pearce's stocks have risen considerably since he last put pen to paper with the Roosters. He has now made nine Origin and three City-Country appearances.
''It's not a hidden fact that halfbacks aren't easy to come by, let alone 23-year-old halfbacks with 120-odd first-grade games and representative honours,'' Newton said.
He said he had given the Roosters verbal assurances which prevented rival clubs from making an early play at Pearce, who is yet to formally discuss his future with his manager.
''I've told the Roosters I'm not interested in talking to anyone until next year - they're aware of that,'' Newton said. ''I hear the rumours and I read the rumours but I haven't spoken to anyone.''

Silicon Knights' next game: The Box?
30th Nov 2009 | 09:08
It's CVG time again: A curriculum vitae has leaked the identity of a game in development at Too Human house, Silicon Knights.
According to the Chinese notes of ex-Silicon Knights artist, Zhang Shao-yong, his previous work includes "Too Human, and The Box (Xbox and PS3)," on which he helped shape visual effects for "explosions, smoke, water, fire, weather and so on."
Like you, we've no idea what 'The Box' is - though we doubt the Canadian developer is working on an Xbox 360 spin-off of the popular music channel.
Casting our eyes back to a 2008 CVG interview with boss Dennis Dyack though, the SK honcho does appear to drops some hints on what The Box could be about.
"We've been lucky enough to make Legacy of Kain, Eternal Darkness, Too Human and if you look at all of those they're all really different," said Dyack. ."
The Too Human developer is already known to be working on a new IP with Sega, which will be the studio's first partnership with a non-platform-holder in ten years. Could this be it?

Bruce Jones rehab request rejected
Published Mar 23 2010, 12:02 GMT | By Daniel Kilkelly
Former Coronation Street star Bruce Jones has reportedly been refused permission to enter a rehab clinic in South Africa.
© Rex Features
According to PA, Jones appeared in court today in a bid to have the date of his sentencing for dangerous driving deferred or brought forward. He made the request so that he would be free to join a Cape Town treatment centre.
However, it is understood that the request was rejected by Judge John Rogers QC because the ex-soap star may still face a jail term.
Jones's defence lawyer had argued that checking into the clinic was "the most effective way" for the actor to begin treatment for alcoholism and would "in no way interfere with the interests of justice".
However, Judge Rogers stated: "I have seen the application that he might go to South Africa and I'm afraid it does not accord with what the trial judge has deemed the appropriate course of action."
Jones, who played Weatherfield layabout Les Battersby for ten years, last week confessed that a drunken rage had caused him to grab the wheel of his wife's car while she was driving and threaten to kill them both.
The 57-year-old is expected to be sentenced as planned on April 16.

Police have charged a Hoke County man with killing two men found dead in their car after it crashed on Gillespie Street on Sunday.
Eric Junior White, 22, of Beltons Loop in Raeford, was charged about 3 a.m. with two counts of first-degree murder, said Lt. Chris Davis, a Fayetteville police spokesman.
White is accused of shooing Anthony DeAngelo Aigle, 23, of West Blue Street in St. Pauls, and Jamone Lasalle Jacques, 26, of the 6200 block of Yewlene Drive in Fayetteville, Davis said.
Officers were called to the 300 block of Gillespie Street, near Campbell Avenue and Blount Street, about shots fired and a traffic accident about 9 p.m., Davis said. When they arrived, they found Aigle and Jacques dead inside a Dodge Charger that had run off the road and into a vacant lot.
White was arrested Sunday night near the crash scene, Davis said.
The motive for the shooting was not known, Davis said.
White is being held without bail in the Cumberland County Detention Center.

USIBWC Awards Contract for Lower Rio Grande Levee Contruction Funded by the Recovery Act
January 13, 2010
International Boundary and Water Commission
United States Section
RECOVERY.GOV
The contract was awarded to Sun Belt Builders, Inc. of Sonoita, Arizona to construct 13 miles of levee improvements along the Rio Grande in Hidalgo County from Lateral A to Retamal Dam. The work will provide enhanced flood protection for the area along the river from east of the City of Hidalgo to south of Donna. The USIBWC is raising levee height in compliance with standards established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to protect against the 100-year river flood. Construction is expected to be completed by January 2011..
“Construction is already underway on Recovery Act levee projects in the Lower Rio Grande Valley,” said U.S. Commissioner C.W. “Bill” Ruth of the International Boundary and Water Commission. “I am pleased we were able to award these contracts, get people back to work, and fix our deficient levees.”
To date, the USIBWC has awarded $144 million in Recovery Act contracts, including the contracts described above and others for levee work in Doña Ana County, New Mexico and El Paso and Hudspeth Counties, Texas. The Recovery Act funding enables the USIBWC to accelerate work on its aging Rio Grande flood control system. The purpose of the Recovery Act is to create and save jobs, promote economic recovery, and invest in infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits.spener@ibwc.gov

Nissan is to build an all-new mid-sized model at its Sunderland plant from 2014, a decision that marks a return to the European mainstream medium segment for the company.
According to Nissan, the new medium hatchback will create an additional 225 jobs at the company and 900 throughout its supply chain.
At last month’s Geneva Motor Show Nissan announced that it is to produce a mainstream B-segment compact car based on the INVITATION concept from next year.
Combined, both models will result in more than 3,000 new jobs being created in the UK automotive sector within the next two years, with 625 at Nissan and the remainder through component suppliers.
Once recruitment for both models is complete, the Sunderland plant workforce will stand at 6,225, supporting an overall annual plant volume of more than half a million units.
Today’s announcement, supported by an offer of £8.2m from the Regional Growth Fund, represents an additional £127m investment by Nissan in its Sunderland operation.
Details regarding Nissan’s recruitment campaign can be found here.

(ARA) - the biggest attractions of tortillas is their versatility, particularly for busy nights when a quick, fresh meal is a necessity. The same tortilla that you would use for a homemade quesadilla can also be used as a pizza crust or dessert crepe. With a little imagination, you can use whole wheat tortillas to create tasty and unexpected dishes that the whole family will love.
* Tortilla pizzas. Think of tortillas as an already-prepared pizza crust that just needs a touch of your creativity. Top whole wheat tortillas with sauce, vegetables and pre-cooked meats for a healthful taste treat. Or, turn it into a dessert by adding fruit, which can take on even bolder flavors when grilled.
* Crepes. Making the traditional French creation can be a real challenge, particularly if you don't have the right tools. Instead, use tortillas to make sweet and savory crepes when the mood strikes. Spiced apple filling is ideal for those with a sweet tooth, but ham-and-cheese or vegetable-and-cheese versions can make great lunches and dinners.
Having easy, nutritious options for dinner, lunch and beyond is the saving grace of many pantries. Keeping a stock of tortillas, particularly nutrient-rich whole wheat varieties, makes it easy to prepare creative, delicious dinners that please all kinds of palates. Try these recipes from Qdoba's head chef Ted Stoner for a fresh, flavorful take on tortillas. For more information about Qdoba, visit.

The parents of a missing 8-year-old girl tearfully asked Friday for the return of their daughter, who disappeared Tuesday evening.The parents of a missing 8-year-old girl tearfully asked Friday for the return of their daughter, who disappeared Tuesday evening.
In a news conference outside their south Jacksonville home, Steve and Sheila Clifton thanked the hundreds of volunteers and police involved in her search for their daughter, Maddie Clifton, and begged that she return.
"Maddie, if you are out there and you can hear us, we are ready for you to come back home," her sobbing mother said. "Maddie is a very strong little girl. She is full of love. Maddie, please come home!"
" "If someone has Maddie, please let her go," Steve Clifton said."Let her go anywhere and run if you have to. I know with all the people out, she would be found immediately."" "If someone has Maddie, please let her go," Steve Clifton said."Let her go anywhere and run if you have to. I know with all the people out, she would be found immediately."
Late Friday the Cliftons announced the reward for the child's safe return was increased to $100,000.
On Thursday, police spent eight hours questioning a neighbor who last saw the child before she disappeared. Larry Grisham said he failed a police polygraph and gave police DNA samples.
"I'm a prime suspect. I'm 45 years old, I play with children and I have a criminal record. That makes me a suspect," Grisham said.
Lt. Mark Foxworth, a homicide detective, said Friday that no one has been eliminated as a suspect. Six other neighbors also were interviewed by police.
On Friday, members of the U.S. Army Reserve were making what they called a "hard search," which included looking in culverts and opening manhole covers.
Information on the girl will be broadcast this weekend on "America's Most Wanted."
Maddie vanished Tuesday night about 5:30 p.m. She was last seen chipping golf balls with Grisham in a yard between his house and a neighbor's, about five doors down from her home.
While police continue to investigate, family and friends tied yellow ribbons to trees and pinned small ones to their clothes. A massive search of the area was planned for Saturday. throughout the weekend for updates on the search for Maddie.

Tonight's guests include:
Karen Tumulty, national political correspondent for The Washington Post
Gabriel Arana, reporter and web editor at The American Prospect and author of the piece “My So Called Ex-Gay Life”
While watching tonight's video preview, take a listen to tonight's soundtrack. (Just be sure to allow the ad below to play out entirely before starting the song)
Executive producer Bill Wolff shares a preview of tonight's show:
It is important for us progressives to acknowledge that members of the NRA run the full spectrum of mental stability covering; Avid sportsman... Normal family man and occasional hunter ... redneck hunter.... rabid redneck hunter... frothing klansman hunter.... certifiable loon .... and at the extreme far end Ted Nugent.
Senator Inhof is crazy about Nugent the nut or nuts about Nugent the crazy; you decide which is more accurate. Senator Inhof is in urgent need of a remedial lesson dealing with the English grammar, specifically context.
The following is a demonstration of the impotance of context. Pay close attention to the words in italics. I love baseball bats for killing people. I will be dead or in jail in one year if Obama is reelected United States President. The first part represents despair or depression, but couple with the second part it suggests psychotic malevolence. Mr. Inhof, certainly you can see that these two phrase coupled together screams for the question, Why, Why, and once again why!begs an explanation
Rachel - first you are my favorite and most informed and intellignet reporter - I want to defent Ms Rosen - she used the wrong first few words but the truth in what she said is quite obvious - Mrs Romney never had to worry about finances, housekeep , child care etc - no comparison to the average homemaker in this country - Keep up the good work in revealing the truth about this Romney compaign - Your devoted Fan! Paul
Romney HAS to separate himself from this maniac. Nugent may as well have a pitchfork and torch leading a mindless lynch mob.
TRMS - my favorite evening activity.
It might be educational to run something about the following.
ALEC's Patriot Act caused the Great Recession.
Real estate value represents over half of accumulated US wealth, and real estate value depends upon population, and ALEC policies reduced the population from 2006 to 2009.
This wealth is destroyed when real estate abandonment becomes common, and that is caused by population decline.
The most important changes are periods of unusually high unemployment and poverty. California personal value dropped from 2007 for the first time since 1938 (Legislative Analysis Office, California, 2009).
Every period of economic decline corresponds with population decline.
These are as follows.
Prior to 1873
This is a period of enormous economic expansion with the exception of 1837 to 1843 and 1857 to 1860.
The Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the US in 1803.
Ethnic cleansing takes place in Louisiana Purchase territory from 1837 to 1843 due to actions taken by Andrew Jackson. This reduces the Native American population by 50% or more.
While most Native Americans are nomadic at the time, they provide migrant labor, trade goods, and consumer demand for manufactured goods (firearms and hardware). This consumer demand was terminated when Native American genocide began and survivors were forcibly removed to the Oklahoma territory by Andrew Jackson. The US calvary is the first modern military organization to engage in biological warfare by providing blankets to Native Americans that were obtained from smallpox wards.
Most surviving Native Americans migrate south and west.
The Mexican American War added the remaining areas of the continental US in 1848 with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
The California Gold Rush begins in 1848, and the killing of Native American people legalized to gain mining rights. Many Native Americans living in the west began to flee south to Mexico or north to Canada to avoid being murdered. Gold production propped up the California economy until 1855.
The economy collapsed again in 1857. Systematic Native American ethnic cleansing began during the collapse in California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho as miners cleared the native population to gain access to farmland. Population statistics were not maintained for Native Americans and the US government did not maintain good financial records, so root cause analysis cannot be done.
US economic growth resumed in 1860 at the same the Civil War began, which implies Native American genocide is linked with the collapse.
Long Depression
The "Old West" period of cowboys and indians begins in 1865 with the end of the Civil War. About half of cowboys are African American, and the remainder a mix of Civil War veterans and civilized Native Americans.
The Long Depression begins in 1873 with genocide and ends with immigration of millions of Europeans and Mexicans beginning in 1897.
This is actually two events that follow the Civil War - the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1893.
Veterans begin slaughtering buffalo for hides following the Civil War. As many as 100,000 buffalo are killed daily during the Great Buffalo Massacre, littering the Great Planes with skeletons. Native Americans populations were reduced by starvation. Most states and territories legalize the murder of starving Native Americans that kill cattle to survive. This collapses consumer demand and real estate value, bankrupting almost 20,000 businesses, almost 100 railroad companies, and dozens of banks.
The Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) accelerated depopulation by deporting most of the 300,000 asians living in the US, with over 200,000 of those deportees coming from California. The Geary Act (1892) required an internal passport for asians. Passports were not issued to most asians, who were deported. Tens of thousands of Native Americans are murdered across California, Oregon and Washington. This collapses consumer demand and real estate value, which bankrupts most of the remaining railroads and hundreds of banks.
Great Depression
The Immigration Act of 1907 reduces consumer demand, triggering a 50% contraction in the money supply that causes a recession. This is blamed on immigrants, and KKK membership grows to dominate Washington politics by 1915 when a second minor economic collapse is caused by World War I.
Work visas are unlimited with a price under $10 at all border crossings and ports with arriving ships. There is no such thing as illegal immigration. The Mexican Revolution causes a large influx of dark skinned people across the southwest border of the US.
This leads to the Immigration Act of 1917 after white supremacists gain control of both houses of congress, the presidency, and the supreme court.
Thousands of citizens with asian or latin appearance are deported from 1920 to 1929. This reduced the depopulation, which increased vacancy and property abandonment. Most of the economic value of banks is tied up in real estate loans, which triggers a foreclosure boom. On average, more than 600 banks failed each year between 1921 and 1929.
The economy utterly collapsed after the National Origins Act of 1929, as follows.
This empowered counties and cities to round up people at gun point based on appearance and deport an average of 200,000/year from 1929 to 1939. About 2 million US residents are forced out of the country. [1]
The same banks making real estate loans routinely lent money for stock market speculation during the 1920s. Money was lent "on margin", which means a small amount of collateral (real estate) was used to obtain a much larger business loan.
Margin lending produced a housing and stock market bubble, where more money was lent by banks than the total amount of available money.
A growing economy is stable only so long as increasing demand continues to force prices upward, and increasing demand requires increasing population.
An unprecedented number of US citizens and immigrants stopped paying rent and mortgages when they were forced out of the US, which triggered a foreclosure boom in June 1929. A vast number of foreclosure sales triggered a precipitous decline in real estate values that collapsed the housing market by September 1929, which reduced bank assets. The maximum real estate declines occur in California.
Decline in bank asset triggered an unprecedented number of margin calls requiring immediate payback of business loans by the end of October 1929.[2]
These events caused the stock market collapse on October 29, 1929. Most
The states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and New Mexico have bumper crops during 1930 and 1931 as stock market and real estate values plummeted. Crop prices fall so low that farmers cannot afford transportation costs required to move crops to market. Famine beings on the east coast.
Hoover does not interfere as farmers begin to destroy the harvest in an attempt to raise prices, which triggers a mild artificial famine.
Mass migration from the east coast to the west coast begins.
Ocean temperature changes from 1931 to 1939 cut off moisture to many states, resulting in a drought so profound that dust blizzards become common [4]. The prevailing view in Washington DC politics is that there is insufficient money available to assist farming states, and famine begins in the dust bowl region.
Farming failures increase the foreclosure rate, which peaks in 1933. Foreclosure rate declines after banking regulation changes in 1933.
Depression era unemployment remains high until 1942 when unemployment drops below 10% at the same time as the beginning of the Bracero Program.
Savings and Loan Crisis
The Mexican economy collapsed in 1982, which triggered mass immigration to the US of 1 million or more every year up to 1986.
Savings and Loan deregulation allowed low-interest loans during this period. This allows borrowers to afford larger loans.
This combination of high real estate demand and low-interest loans created a massive increase in real estate prices in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Florida, and California.
Mexican immigration ended abruptly with the Immigration and Reform Control Act, which eliminated demand for new construction.
At the same time, interest deductions for real estate investments became non-deductible from primary income, so investors began selling real estate.
At the same time, there was a major drought that reduced agricultural productivity.
This combination of events created excess capacity, high vacancy rates, and a foreclosure boom that collapsed real estate value.
Excess foreclosures collapsed over 700 Savings and Loans, and activated requirements for over $80 billion in insurance by RTC.
The Immigration Act of 1990 increased immigration, which ended the downward spiral of real estate prices.
Great Recession
Illegal immigrants contribute about $200 billion in GSP across the entire US. That consumer demand employs about 10 million US residents.
Three important events occur from 2000 to 2006 during the Bush presidency.
These regulatory changes cause real estate prices and stock prices to skyrocket as investors borrow as much money as is possible. This is intended to restore economic losses that followed the attack of September 11, 2001.
This deregulation does create rapid economic growth, and illegal immigrants flood into the country at the highest rate since the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920. This fuels a construction boom in the American south and west as hundreds of thousands of excess dwellings are constructed.
The following begins in 2006.
The Mexican economy improves in 2007, and the US population begins to decline. Population decline creates over a million extra dwelling vacancies by 2009.
Real estate prices plummet in 2007 and a foreclosure boom begins in 2008 as foreclosure rates increase by 400%.
Pres. Bush realizes the magnitude of the coming disaster caused by eliminating depression era financial regulations. Bush signs the Emergency Mortgage Loan Modification Act of 2007 in an attempt to prevent the coming banking system collapse, but it is too late.
Real estate value depends upon people to demand dwellings in which to live (US Census Bureau).
Immigration departing the US accounts for a drop of about 1.6% in the population in less than 2 years.
Each US resident creates consumer demand for real estate, vehicles, food, and consumer goods, and that consumer demand includes illegal immigrants.
The illegal immigrant population of Arizona produced $42 billion in GSP during 2008, and immigrant population decline is one of the underlying causes for economic collapse in the American south and west (Immigration Policy Center, 2011).
Birth nearly equals mortality during this period, so this population change is entirely due to migration that contributes the following to the US economy.
The following shows how migration contributed to part of the decline in US real estate values, which collapses real estate value in the American south and west.
The resulting foreclosure boom and real estate collapse in 2007 leaves inadequate asset recovery from foreclosure sales, which reduces bank assets to dangerously low levels.
Banks issue margin calls for stock market investments to cover lending losses in an attempt to avoid bankruptcy.
Margin calls result in rapid trading that collapses the stock market. Over 60% of value is lost from 2007 to 2009 as the population declines.
Investment firms, banks, and businesses lose sufficient capitol that they cannot cover the losses, and the US government is forced to issues loans in order to prevent total economic collapse and double digit unemployment.
This chain of events halts the startup of new businesses, at the same time that millions of jobs are lost in manufacturing, real estate, construction, finance, and investment.
Departure of 5 million immigrants raised unemployment by about 4 million from 2007 to 2009.
A return of 2.6 million immigrants reduced unemployment by about 2 million from 2009 to 2011.

I watched the show tonite and got the impression that you thought it might be a good idea to make and use a license plate with the word vajayjay on it
Kind of like, yeah, I want my vajayjay in as many faces as possible everywhere I go
This seems disturbed and disturbing, and not in a good way to relate to a crowd---kind of like sexual harrassment; or desperate attention seeking
No, I'm not a doctor, but I know when something seems over the top and inappropriate, and just wrong; again, like freedom without restraint, license to act mentally disturbed, and my license plate proves it. I think you might be the one that needs a "check up", and remember, not all doctors are created equal
Not long ago, I heard a well known bishop state that the reason same-gender-loving people are the way they are is because of spiritual and emotional brokenness. Because this minister is highly regarded and esteemed by thousands worldwide, it wasn’t long before other copy-cat-wanna-be bishops and aspiring televangelists picked up the phrase (coined it) and began to spread it on the internet and throughout the country like wildfire. Instead of arraying themselves in the fruits of the Spirit or putting on the full armor of God, they armed themselves with weapons of misinformation that perpetuates intolerance and preserves heterosexual privilege.
The manifestation of their labor bred only suffering, self-hatred (in same-gender-loving people) and dwindling congregations with no power, influence, and wasted gifts. By ignoring the true message of the Gospel, they continuously drive people away from Christ rather than to Him. Additionally, they imprison themselves in hatred, anger and ignorance and miss out on God’s amazing message of unconditional and life-giving love. How sad for those teachers of hate (or should I say of the LAW). Moreover, how sad for all the victims of lies and intolerance whose lives have been devastated!
To be honest with you, I did not realize how prevalent this type of spiritual malpractice was until I conducted a Google search on the subject and to my dismay, I discovered how widespread this ideology is in Christendom today. Even though it is said that same-gender-loving people are broken, current literature and most scholars in the field state that one’s sexual orientation is not a choice; that is, individuals do not choose to be homosexual or heterosexual. There is no scientific evidence that proves that dysfunctional parents, sexual abuse, adverse life events, or early childhood experiences dictate and determine sexual orientation.
However, negative life experiences may influence them to a certain degree, but they cannot override them! Those assumptions are now understood to have been based on misinformation and prejudice. No major mental health professional or organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation, and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.
After pondering the myth that one’s sexual orientation can be changed, I couldn’t help but think to myself, “I wonder how the heterosexual community would feel if someone told them that the reason they were black or heterosexual was because they were spiritually broken!” Trust me my brothers and sisters, if anyone dared make an outlandish statement like this, every African-American would be up in arms and ready to crucify the offenders! I realize that this comparison enrages many African-Americans who feel that the gay community has hijacked the Civil Rights movement to champion their cause and that I have no right to make such a comparison.
The interesting thing to note however, is that the Bible makes it very clear that ALL OF HUMANITY, IN GOD’S EYES, ARE BROKEN and in need of a REDEEMER! I find it amazing that the heterosexual faith community foolishly believes that God somehow excludes them from the fold because of some special heterosexual privilege.
My heart breaks year after year, as I witness my same-gender-loving brothers and sisters leaving the church by the thousands because of the spiritual blindness that handicaps our spiritual leaders and those who subscribe to their punitive legalistic doctrine. What is even worse is their refusal to acknowledge the fact that thousands of same-gender-loving people sit in their congregations and live in their communities.
These are severe consequences that eventually hurt and in some way impact us all! This dogmatic denial and disfranchisement of same-gender-loving people without a doubt is a prime reason why, as previously mentioned, many congregations dwindle each week and multitudes turn away from Christ because Christians have misrepresented Him out of their own prejudice, misinterpretation of Scripture, and homophobia.
When I consider the fact that 48% of African-American women between the ages of 14 and 49 could possibly be infected with the Herpes virus and that approximately 1.1 million adults and adolescents are living with HIV in the USA, including those not yet diagnosed, and those who have already progressed to AIDS (according to the CDC), I just want to scream! I just want to say to them, “Are you so blind that you cannot see that the very people you say you care about are being destroyed before your very eyes while you misappropriate your time and millions of your parishioner’s tithes and offerings to prevent same-gender-loving people from possessing equal rights. That very money you squander should be used to provide services that truly minister effectively to the real needs of people!”
Now here is the most tragic and ironic result of this misguided and misdirected thinking: Hundreds, if not thousands of the church’s parishioner’s access HIV/AIDS services primarily from the gay community because they are unequipped to provide these same services. It is literally safe to say that the gay community has effectively and compassionately saved the lives of thousands of their members for many years. Yet Sunday after Sunday, pastors and priests mount their pulpits without reservation, and without good sense, and boldly declare before all that these same caregivers are all hell bound because they are gay; not knowing anything about their personal relationship with the Creator at all!
Because same-gender loving people are considered “broken” by Christians and most of society, it is assumed that our relationships are also certainly broken in the eyes of God, and that we are the main cause for the deterioration of the family unit today, and are seen as the main culprit responsible for the high divorce rate among Christian heterosexual couples. But when you really consider what people are really saying when they make these kinds of unfounded claims, one cannot help but agree with Pastor Romell Weekly, a same-gender-loving man, who recently said, ?”
These are just a few reasons as to why I was inspired to write my first book, Love Won’t Let Me Be Silent and now, They Say That I Am Broken! Like Love Won’t Let Me Be Silent, this new literary endeavor didn’t just come to be as a result of intuitive or Divine inspiration alone, but was also birthed in the hearts of men and women around me who sacrificed their time, shared their hopes and dreams for a better tomorrow, expressed their concerns, and contributed their resources out of love for me and for all of humanity.

the thing about Rachel that's so aggravating, is that she is so obsessed with proving that
she is just as important as men that it negates her credibility; and her one sided biased views are so narrow it's just obvious she doesn't see the big picture, I'm not sure how she thinks she's helping America except to make sure everyone's happy; "let's open our arms to the world and just let everyone come on in..we'll have a welcome cake ready for them" she's so obsessed with her women are equal and equal rights for everyone agenda that she can't realize that sometimes you need to just assume your role in life... How could she care about the future of America when she will never have children of her own; while most of us can see where America's headed these people that are so obsessed with being different can't see what's really at stake; this is selfish and ignorant, but I don't think too many people take her that serious as her words pretty much put her in her own place, people can sense intuitively what's really going on and this is a woman obsessed with proving she's just as good or better than a man when no one ever said she wasn't in the first place. Her own agenda is skewing the reality of the real issues at stake..

The Ig Nobel Awards are the jokey tongue-in-cheek equivalent to the Nobel Awards – (though the decision to award president Obama the Nobel Prize for Peace just a few months after he had taken up office looks an even bigger ‘joke’ now than it did then)
This years Ig Nobel prizewinners include the researchers who found leaning to the left while looking at an oblect makes that object appear smaller, and researchers who found brain activity in a dead salmon.
The one that caught my eye though – and which has great commercial potential – is the SpeechJammer, a machine that . . . disrupts a person’s speech by playing it back with a very slight delay.
“It’s a small thing you aim at someone who is droning on and on . . . What the person hears is just off enough that it completely disconcerts and discombobulates them, and they stop talking. It has thousands of potential good uses.“
Yes, I can think of a few uses for a device of that kind !!!

MAFW playlists are shared, this means they are stored and exposed by the mafw-playlist-daemon, which makes them available for all MAFW based applications, that can access and manipulate them concurrently through its API.
Because the playlists are always remote objects stored and handled by a separate process, whenever the application needs to deal with a playlist there is a need for inter-process communications. However these communications are hidden to developers by using a proxy object. These proxy objects allow developers to interact with the playlists as if they were local objects, making the underlying communications with the playlist daemon transparent for the application developer.
Operations like creating or removing a playlist or obtaining the list of available playlists, are done through the MafwPlaylistManager object. This object acts as a proxy of the playlist daemon, for playlist related operations that do not deal with a particular playlist. A reference to this object can be obtained like this:
MafwPlaylistManager *manager = mafw_playlist_manager_get ();
The following sections explain in more detail how to use the MafwPlaylistManager and proxy playlist objects.

For more than 200 years, life at the College has been centered at its Cistern Yard. Here, in a sacred spot both at the heart of campus and downtown Charleston, magnificent buildings surround an incredible urban garden of live oaks and a large lawn. This is where generations of students have come to sit, paint, converse and study. This is where countless visitors have snapped pictures and thousands of graduates have skipped over a stage, donned in white dresses and white dinner jackets, their hands eagerly outstretched to accept hard-earned degrees.
This past May, more than 1,600 students and their families crowded the yard for the spring commencement ceremony. While the graduates’ achievements made the day significant enough, the audience was also able to take special delight in their surroundings. The College had just finished a nearly four-year project to restore and preserve the buildings of the Cistern Yard – and Randolph Hall, Towell Library and Porters Lodge have never looked better.
It’s perhaps most accurate to describe the painstaking work on these landmark buildings as artistry, plain and simple. Tradesmen were challenged to make repairs to the buildings while preserving the weathered patina on each façade. In areas where new stucco was applied over brick walls, workers scored the patches by hand and carefully painted the area with varying shades of lime wash to achieve a seamless blend.
Each and every door, window and shutter on the buildings was removed, restored and re-installed. Additionally, each light, or pane, of glass was removed from the windows to enable wood repairs. On Randolph Hall alone this meant the removal of more than 120 windows. Some of these windows had accumulated more than 35 layers of paint and featured sashes of 25 panes over 25 panes.
Other important work on Randolph Hall included the repair and partial replacement of the building’s terra-cotta capitals. Shipped down from Massachusetts in the 1850s when Charleston architect Edward Brickell White designed a southern portico for Randolph Hall (known as Main Building then), the capitals are some of the earliest pieces of architectural terra cotta in the country.
Repairs were also made to Randolph Hall’s slate roof, as well as to the slate roofs above Towell Library and Porters Lodge. New copper gutters and downspouts were installed on all three buildings, and deteriorated brownstone was replaced and repaired as needed. All three buildings also received new tension rods, otherwise known as earthquake bolts, to provide enhanced structural support.
These repairs and more were accomplished using a $3.7 million appropriation from the State. This money, in addition to resources from the College, was also used to improve the landscaping within the College’s historic campus, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971. A new lawn and plantings, dramatic nighttime lighting and improved irrigation systems and walkways now complement the showcase buildings. The upkeep and maintenance of these buildings, as well as the scores not listed on the National Register but of historical significance, is one of the top priorities for the College.
“The College of Charleston has 80 buildings over 100 years old and several that are over 200 years old. They have stood the test of time through natural disasters, wars and economic turmoil,” says President P. George Benson. “These buildings truly represent the rich and interwoven histories of the College and the City of Charleston. And as the city’s largest historic preservationist, we take very seriously our obligation to preserve and protect them.
“Restoring these national treasures,” President Benson adds, “ensures that they will be enjoyed by students, faculty, staff and visitors for generations to come.”

I wholeheartedly support this idea in theory. But it seems scary in practice. We would need to run all automatic and manual AWT regression tests on at least all major WMs (Metacity, Kwin, Compiz, and (sic!) CDE - as long as we support Solaris CDE desktops, not sure if this is relevant to JDK 8 though) to ensure no regressions arise. Note that we have to test this with quite old versions of the WMs, e.g. Metacity from Gnome 2.6 (or is it 2.4?) - this is what Solaris 10 has to offer, etc. And ideally we would also want to test on all those forgotten/rare creatures like SawFish, Motif, Enlightenment, etc. This looks like a lot of work for such a simple fix. However, your current fix looks pretty safe and is fully consistent with our current XAWT code. Artem, what's your opinion? -- best regards, Anthony

Sure, you can write your scripts in any language. But, what of your script uses a Python 2.6 feature and you happen to be deploying to a platform that has 2.4? Welcome to the world of today, of major Linux distributions. Of course, I'm recommending Bash here, but it has a lot of the same problems. There are differences between *BSD, GNU and Solaris userland that can make or break. I guess I prefer Bash because these differences are old, documented and stable. "Agile" languages are quickly moving targets for deployment. My problem with Chef was first installing it: getting dependencies at their right versions, and then making sure that clients and servers had the exact same version, because Chef spits out strange error messages if it doesn't. The promise of Chef/Puppet is really nice -- to abstract the painful differences between deployment targets. But I think the projects themselves have a ways to go. -Tal On 09/23/2010 09:03 AM, sheila miguez wrote: > > what happened? > > also, I thought people also wrote recipes in python? > >> On Sep 23, 2010 1:05 AM, "Tal Liron" <tal.liron at threecrickets.com >> <mailto... >> > > _______________________________________________ > Chicago mailing list > Chicago at python.org >

Hey I got linked to your idea by David Malcolm on his plugin mailing list. I am looking to apply to Gsoc once again this year i have done gsoc 2010 and 2011 on GCC implementing my own GCC front-end for python which is still in very early stages since its a huge task. But i am tempted to apply to this project to implement a more self contained project to give back to the community more promptly while that hacking on my own front-end on my own timer. And i think it would benefit me to get to understand in more detail different aspects of python which is what i need and would gain very much experience from. I was wondering if you could give me some more details on how this could all work i am not 100% familiar with cython but i think i understand it to a good extend from playing with it for most of my evening. I just want to make sure i understand the basic use case of this fully, When a user could have something like: -header foo.h extern int add (int, int); -source foo.c #include "foo.h" int add (int x, int y) { return x+y; } We use the plugin to go over the decls created and create a pxd file like: cdef int add (int a, int b): return a + b Although this is a really basic example i just want to make sure i understand whats going on. Maybe some more of you have input? I guess this would be best suited as a proposal for Python rather than GCC? --Phil

I have finally made the final, real release of MySQLdb-0.2.2. See: Among other things, there's real transaction support (needs MySQL-3.23.15+), and a CompatMysqldb module which should be a drop-in replacement for MySQLmodule's Mysqldb, for those of you with legacy code. Consider this bit experimental. Some of the _mysql API has changed a bit, which will foul up anything which uses it (i.e. Zope ZMySQLDA). There's probably a bunch of other stuff I don't remember, but shouldn't cause any problems. --!"

Hi! This is a (very small) bug report for 2.0beta4 (no showstopper). I just tried to subscribe to the python announce list on <URL:> (where Mailman 2.0beta4 is running) and entered an email address and two differing passwords. Then I clicked on "Subscribe" and received a reply ("Python-announce-list Subscription results: Your passwords did not match.") in one HTML file containing this same message *three* times. I can't imagine this was your intention, so I thought I'd let you know. I'm not subscribed to mailman-developers any more, so please Cc: me, if you've got some more questions for me. Have fun, Uli

But developer is by definition a person, who know something about informational technologies. So, arrogance of "frienly" interface is unbearable for him. He knows what we wants his machine to do, and when he sees that machine has its own opinion, as "friendly" interface should and do, it becomes very irritating. --

[Michael Chermside] > ... > I wish we'd caught this before 2.3. Have you confirmed that a problem exists? I haven't tried. If there is, it should have been caught: the release PEP makes clear that the Windows installer should be run with and without admin privs, and using targets with and without embedded spaces. It's my fault that this wasn't done -- there simply wasn't enough "spare time" to run the full course with this release, and I consumed all the time I could make for it intensely testing a single installation. Speaking of which, that doesn't look likely to change anytime soon, so if someone else is willing to take over the PLabs Windows installer, it's yours. Overall, it's in very good shape. Whoever is interested should also consider switching to InnoSetup (and there's a patch on SF moving closer toward that end). > Unfortunately, I usually avoid "Program Files" for exactly this reason, and > I'm guessing other testers did the same. Most people accept the defaults. "Program Files" is fine for an end-user app, but for a tool that's going to get used from scripts and command shells, a path with an embedded space is just begging for needless problems. For that reason, if IDLE does have a problem with embedded spaces, I really don't care.

Studio Art
Mission Statement
The Studio Art Program at Willamette University aims to introduce students to a wide variety of media, materials and genres. In keeping with goals of the Liberal Arts Education, Art is taught in an interdisciplinary way, and our curriculum emphasizes the development of technique and craftsmanship as well as theory and conceptualization in the context of the Fine Arts. Our program is designed specifically to encourage students to question and expand their understanding of what art is, how it affects the viewer, and how it is made. Students are guided towards seeing the arts as a means of exploring the world around them, a way of finding and defining their own place in that world, and a vehicle for communicating that understanding to others. Students develop skill in using art as a visual, symbolic, formal and expressive language. The department sees an awareness of an appreciation for process as being a key component of art practice. The program addresses both the artistic and verbal/written skills students need to succeed in the arts, and supports student development with introductory to advanced courses, culminating in a thesis project.
The following information describes expectations for the Studio Art major at Willamette University:
- The Studio Art program is designed to provide both breadth and depth in your development as an artist. The program places emphasis on an understanding of general art concepts through a variety of courses including foundation studies, drawing, and two- and three-dimensional studies. In addition, students are required to take art history courses. Later in the program, students focus their development in an area of specialty. The program prepares students for their final thesis project created in Senior Seminar, the apex course for the Art Major. See the course catalog for the specific requirements of the major and variety of subjects and media available for exploration.
- Students who declare a Studio Art major are asked to take a foundation course their first semester, Advanced Media and Design in the spring of their junior year, Writing for Artists and Senior Seminar their senior year, and balance the remaining program requirements with guidance from their advisors. It is highly encouraged that students declare their major by the beginning of their sophomore year and have at least three studio courses taken by the start of their junior year.
- Course projects are regularly displayed in the Art Building and elsewhere on campus. In addition, the Student Art Coordinator facilitates special group exhibitions each semester. Art Majors are encouraged to regularly exhibit their work on campus and beyond.
- In conjunction with Student Scholarship Recognition Day and the Senior Art Majors exhibit, all junior Art Majors participate in the Spring Review Exhibition in the Student Gallery in the Art Building in April. Students formally present their works for review by their peers and the studio faculty.
- Studio Art Majors enroll in Senior Seminar in the fall and spring of their senior year. Students and faculty members meet as a group in weekly classroom sessions to develop senior thesis projects and discuss current issues in the arts. The thesis project builds upon art skills and strategies developed during the years in the program. Regular meetings with advisors encourage students to move beyond ordinary coursework to a new level of commitment and originality for the thesis project. Senior Art Majors present their final thesis project in the Senior Exhibition at the Hallie Ford Museum of Art each April. This is one of the most popular and heavily attended museum exhibitions of the year. A final group critique session is scheduled in which students present their work to faculty and peers.
- The Department strives to maintain contact with alumni in an effort to track our graduates' on-going work in the arts or other fields. Please keep us informed of your experiences beyond Willamette.
Further questions may be referred to faculty advisors and the Department Chair.

Gap's new Stay fragrance is a light, wearable version of summer floral. Courtesy photo.
If you're looking for a light new summer fragrance to love, Gap is betting they have your solution.
Rolling out to stores right now, Stay is Gap's gentle new scent formulated to smell bright and floral-y without overwhelming you -- or the people around you.
"With Stay, we wanted to embody the freshness of a summer evening. Its bright, light scent is like a whisper on the skin, making that ephemeral, perfect summer moment last all year long," says Patrick Robinson, Gap's EVP of Design.
With top notes of green hydrangea and soft freesia, Stay's middle notes go subtle with light blue lotus and blooming white peony. The two key bottom notes of amber musk and driftwood are blended to balance out the florals, and to keep the scent on the delicate side.
We're loving the placid blue packaging, which reminds us of sunny beach days under a cloudless and blue open sky. Yet funny enough, it wasn't the turquoise of oceans or summer skies that inspired the Gap folks to come up with this shade -- rather, it was the hue chosen by Pantone as the color of the year for 2010.
They're not alone; from Chanel's Nail Vernis in Nouvelle Vague to Nars' light, wearable Duo Cream Eyeshadow in Burn It Blue, turquoise is a major summer color must-wear.
While the 3.5 and 1.7 fl oz bottles are available from $25 to $35, we suggest dipping your toes with the .33 oz bottle priced at a budget-friendly $8.50, before you make a fuller commitment to the scent.
Because, after all -- us women are all about options. In related news, be sure to check out which model is the new face of Prada's scent.

I think painting the mirror white or the darker green would pop quite nicely! I very much like the fixtures you chose for your lighting!
I very much like them too. Those were from Schoolhouse Electric.
I think a shiny dark green on the mirror would look great!
I love it so far!
that print is super adorable!!
The mirror frame would look fabulous in black!
I concur….. A matt black would be lovely and picks out the black in the zig-zag accessories and light fixtures.
:O)
What about the Light blue you painted the basement door? It would be a little bit of cheer to brighten the space up.
Not a bad idea…
Are the stripes on the little lamps black? If so I’d say black. Looking good!
Yes, and on the towel too.
This is what I was thinking.
What’s that little first aid kit? Does it mount on the wall?
It does.
I agree with the above posters that the mirror would look great in black, but how about a pale pink to reference the other areas of the basement space. Or a similar pinkish-beige to reference the background of the art?
I vote for a deep peony pink on the mirror! Or maybe a fun clock like this one:
Fun!
That was my thought. A deep, bright pink.
jbhat
Normally I love pink and green, but I’m not sure I’d like it with a green as olive-y as the one in here.
Super cute shoes! Where are they from?
J. Crew, last year.
yes, great shoes! That is the first thing that popped into my mind.
I was going to comment on the shoes too – love them!
Why is your tiny basement bathroom so much cuter than any of the ones in my house?
The basement bathroom is the cutest one in the house now. We should start sending guests down there if they need to use the facilities!
where is that first aid kit from?? its adorable!
I wrote about it here.
BLACK! Shiny!
I think light pink for the mirror to tie in with the pink walls just outside. Though white would look great, too. I’m not thrilled with a dark green. I think you need more contrast (and lighter accessories).
I like the pink idea (always a fan of pink), and stevie’s suggestion of light blue in a comment above too.
Love how the bathroom is turning out! (And also love your shoes!)
Love how the bathroom is coming along. I vote for a black mirror.
I am loving your shoes though! Where are they from?
J. Crew. They’re a little tight now though — I’m hoping my feet go back to their former pre-pregnancy size so I can continue to wear them.
I vote black for the mirror frame!
Just found this blog and LOVE it! Where did you get the print that says “you look lovely today”? I absolutely adore it. Also, I think a white would look awesome on that mirror. Thanks for sharing your journey!
Thanks! I wrote about the print here, jokingly saying that it would take the place of a mirror..
Oh my goodness I love that print! Off to purchase it now…
I came to the site from my reader just to comment that you should most certainly paint the mirror black…but then I read the other comments and I was swayed by the deep peony pink!
or what about a metallic finish? just to brighten it up in there without totally bringing in another color? so, silver? (maybe it’s your shoes that inspired me!)
I’m totally distracted by the sparkly goodness that’s going on down by your tootypegs. Where, oh where did you find those???
I love that shade of green with light blue. Maybe light blue is an option for the mirror and a few accessories?
love that print, especially for the bathroom!
whatever color you choose for the mirror, have you considered martha’s new metallic paints?
I was honestly thinking a metallic silver color would look good.
i love the color it is now in that photo!
I think the mirror would still look really great painted yellow. It would be a nice pop of color!
my first thought was that color that the Youngsters at Young House Love painted their built-ins…Dragonfly by Benjamin Moore.
although I think the peony would be awesome.
Def. black for the mirror.
I vote for the laundry room blue, just a little touch of Tiffany :)
Paint the mirror Peony!! Pink has never been a bad choice for you *it’s your signature color!*
A must say that a peony pink mirror would make me swoon a little. It would be so you! :)
Have you not considered white for the mirror? I like the idea of a lighter color with the green, although black would look nice too.
i vote the light blue or black. white would be nice, but think of all the dusting in those little nooks and crannies. >.<
Wow – so many good suggestions. Are you feeling overwhelmed? I think whatever you choose, it will look great and all will be envious. Another commentor suggested white and another pink. What about a super pale, pale blush pink? Mmmm, can’t wait to see!
I am not always a proponent of black but I think it would look very sharp in your adorable bathroom.
The mirror frame in black would looh very sculptural and match nicely with the other accessories.
black. it would bring out the details in your sconces so nicely.
Shiny silver! Is there such a thing as silver leaf?
i vote white or black.
How about silver?
I vote for a bright medium blue color. Sounds crazy at first, but look at this color palette from Emily Henderson:
Its blue with green, but you could do something of the reverse and I bet it would look great!
It’s coming together nicely. I vote silver for the mirror because of the fixtures.
What about red?
Silver, blue or red (especially if they are near your washer/dryer.
Black
Love that frame! Wherever did you find it?
And your sparkly shoes are too cute! :)

This week has seen me spending a lot of time in front of the computer with a weird cold (It’s weird because I felt awful but it was never a full-blown cold). I’ve been catching up on silly achievement things that Millya hadn’t done yet. For instance, I had to get Vidyala the reputation to buy the schematic to make this bad boy:
In actual fact, I don't think Millya would ever have a license plate that says "pwn" because it's not grammatically correct.
So I’ve been having fun creating noise pollution and generally looking badass (come on, you can’t tell me that doesn’t look badass) and not really writing anything of my own… But I have read some blog posts lately that are worth a look if you’ve missed them!
Heavy Wool Bandage wrote about Intellect Issues – not the stat. To me, this post is a reminder to have patience with everyone who is playing and think about the things you say. We’re all playing for different reasons and with different skill-sets, and sometimes it’s easy to forget. That’s different, not “better.”
I’m not linking to a specific post, but in case you missed this news, Jaedia is blogging again at Jaedia’s Menagerie after a hiatus. Drop by and say hi!
Kamalia posted an image of a curly-haired Tauren I just love. You may have guessed from my own character, but I like curly hair. It’d be great to see some new Tauren hairstyles in general.
Akabeko at Red Cow Rise wrote a short fic about an archaelogy item that’s bothered me, too. I found it poignant and sad.
Finally, Shintar shares some of her pug stories from recently. They aren’t horror ones, either, further reminder that sometimes pugs are just fine. (I think we all need that from time to time).
Voss and I booked our hotel for our trip at the end of June. We’re not going to Blizzcon, but we are going to Vancouver and we’ll meet three guildies/WoW folks during the trip! I don’t usually do this, but I’m trying to build a buffer of posts to schedule for while I’m away. If you have any requests or ideas for posts or things you’d like to see here, let me know in the comments and I’ll see what I can do! No promises, but the muse could use a bit of a hand right now.
Thank you for the link! I’ve been sitting on that post for a while and finally decided it was time to share
*Big hugs* for the link love! Thank you
Thanks for the link!
As for post suggestions, well, you know I always enjoyed reading your pug stories as well…
You still need to be allowed to say “Aaaayy!” like The Fonz when riding that chopper, but that’s just me.
Thanks for providing the links!
Grats on getting your chopper! Woo-hoo!
Thanks for the link! X!

A severe thunderstorm may have brought relief from high temperatures, but it also left thousands without power in Monmouth and Ocean counties Saturday evening.
Over 50,000 customers had lost power by 8:45 p.m., according to Jersey Central Power & Light and Atlantic Electric.
Toms River was among the worst hit, with over 11,000 without power. Howell Township had over 8,600 customers in the dark and Brick had more than 2,800. Wall had nearly 800 in the dark.
Atlantic Electric reported than more than 3,000 customers lost power in Manhawkin. The company's outage map is here.
Berkeley Township was relatively unscathed, with minimal power outages in some sections of town, Mayor Carmen F. Amato Jr. said.
However, township parks and recreation department workers were out shortly after the storm, helping to clear roads where trees had fallen, the mayor said.
Residents can call the Berkeley Township Police Department to report power outages or downed trees at 732-341-6600 or JCP&L at: 1-888-544-4877
In the eastern part of the Monmouth County, Bradley Beach was most impacted, with 3,200 customers without power--nearly all JCP&L's customers in the borough. Eatontown had 1,340 households without power and Red Bank had just over 1,000.
JCP&L makes information on outages available on its Web site.

We were on a lagoon in Normandy Beach. We watched the storm come across the bay and it was amazing. Wind was blowing heavy outdoor furniture across decks, inflatable pools were flying (one was caught in the wires on a pole on 35!) and the lightning was spectacular. One side of the lagoon lost power and then our side did. The rain was fierce and for a while you just couldn't see out the windows. Then it was over the ocean and the sun was setting over the bay in a bright orange sky and their was a rainbow over the ocean with lightning bolts all around it. It was absolutely amazing!

Four large trees down, big dent in quarter panel of car when large fence gate let go, busted up umbrella and patio table and several days of cleanup and large trees, 75 footers to cut up.Yuk!

Live in Silverton, saw the clouds started to roll in and closed everything up. Lots of lightning, a few short bursts of really heavy wind and rain, but overall the storm didn't seem too bad. Lights went out for a split second and came right back on. I have not seen any damage from the storm. All our outdoor furniture stayed put, no trees came down or lost limbs, wires are all intact.

Book: Best Kept Secret
Author: Amy Hatvany
It’s time for June’s Blast-O-Books and I want to kick it off with one of the best and most thought-provoking books I’ve read in a really long time. Best Kept Secret by Amy Hatvany was heart-breaking and uplifting all at the same time. At the center of this novel is Cadence, a single-mom who is trying the best that she can to get through her days raising a whirlwind of a happy little boy and working in freelance writing. When life becomes more and more difficult, and she starts suffering from insomnia, and work is not coming for her, a glass of wine at night helps her to sleep. That glass of wine becomes two and three, which then turns into a couple of bottles a night. Within a year, she is a full-blown alcoholic on the verge of losing the most important thing in her life: her son Charlie.
I was drawn to this book for so many reasons. As a mom to three children very close in age, I know what it’s like to need something to calm the nerves when you’re at your wit’s end, when you think you might blow a gasket over spilled milk. I also discovered that two of my absolute favorite authors, Emily Giffin and Sarah Pekkanen have already read, loved and blurbed Best Kept Secret. And of course, there have been times in my own life that I have blogged about being unable to care for my own children because I’ve been too hung over. So this book hit home for me, and I’m very confident that Best Kept Secret will unearth feelings in every single woman who’s ever had a sip of wine, or felt like she’s not doing the best job at motherhood, or maybe has been unsure about everything in life she thought she had a handle on.
Here is a Q&A I did with Amy, which was very kind of her to take the time seeing as her book debuts on Tuesday! Thanks Amy!
Me: I'm soaring through Best Kept Secret, and if I didn't have 3 kids and a busy schedule with them, I would have cleared my days and finished it by now. I am in love with little Charlie and my heart breaks for Cadence, who has what I can see, was a slow-growing yet serious drinking problem. What I love about this book is that I think all mothers of young children can see a part of themselves in Cadence, whether they find themselves craving a glass of wine, a Xanax, or even needing to satiate their nerves with a pile of carbohydrates. What do you think?
Amy: You are very sweet! I’m happy you’ve been drawn into the story, and I think you’re absolutely right. My hope in writing the book was that women might see the similarities they share with Cadence, rather than the differences, you know? Because I think it’s pretty easy and automatic to look at a mother with a drinking problem and say, “oh, I’d never do that; I’d never be her.” But I don’t know a mother out there who doesn’t look for some kind of escape from the constant emotional, mental, and physical demands of caring for children - toddlers, especially! Whether it’s in a glass of wine, a carton of ice cream, or online shopping - the indulgence is motivated by the same need - to soothe inner turmoil. I hoped that in creating a character who readers can relate to on many different levels, I might also create a better understanding and sense of empathy for how Cadence ends up with a drinking problem, and how much vicious judgment and stigma she had to fight against in order to get well.
Me: What inspired Best Kept Secret? How much of the book was drawn from real life experience?
Amy: While the plot and characters are fiction, I was inspired to write the book based on my own experiences of being a mother and an alcoholic. The emotional experiences Cadence has are much like what I went through - the guilt, the shame, the denial and disbelief that I couldn’t just figure out a way to stop drinking on my own. I’d had a lot of success in my life before that point, and I didn’t understand how in the world I couldn’t just put an end to a behavior that was so obviously destroying me.
I am very much like Cadence in that I maintained a very happy, confident exterior for the rest of the world to see, but subconsciously, I struggled with feelings of loneliness and fear. I was such a convincing actress, though, I couldn’t articulate or maybe wasn’t even aware of those feelings. I had gone through a terrible divorce, and like Cadence, developed a bad case of insomnia. I never really drank much before that point, so that first glass of wine relaxed me and seemed like an easy solution to my sleeping issues. Of course, I didn’t understand how easily I’d build a physical tolerance to alcohol, and how dependent I’d become on the mental and emotional “escape” my nightly big-ass goblet of wine gave me from the pressure of single motherhood. Eventually, I, too, came to a point where I had a stare down with a bottle of pills, unsure if I really wanted to continue living, but the thought of my children growing up without me was what led me to finally ask for help. I’ve been sober almost six years, and I know it sounds strange to say, I feel like my spiral into drinking was one of the best things that could have happened for me. It woke me up. And it gave me the inspiration to write the book and let other women know they are not alone in this kind of struggle.
Me: What was the hardest part about writing Best Kept Secret? Easiest?
Amy: The hardest part was definitely revisiting the shame and guilt of what it is like to drink in front of a child. The thought of alcohol really does make me ill, now, so having to go back to the time when I was drinking every day and remembering what it felt like - the physical sensations, and then the emotional backlash that always immediately followed - was extremely difficult.
I think the easiest part was writing the scenes with Cadence and Charlie, showing how they were connected, how much she adores him, and he loves and needs her. I have an incredible relationship with my children, and all I had to do was pull that feeling up, and those scenes just kind of appeared on the page. (Plus, my son actually did call them “blueberry stones” instead of “blueberry scones”!) My life with my children is filled with so many tender, wonderful moments, and getting to infuse Cadence and Charlie’s relationship with those kinds of emotions was my favorite aspect of writing the story.
Me: You've written two previous books (The Language of Sisters and The Kind of Love That Saves You) under another name, Amy Yurk, and I can’t wait to read those two books! I also noticed you focus on really hard topics in your novels - mental retardation, rape, death, alcoholism, divorce, single parenthood. Yet it seems that there are hopeful messages within. Why do you think you tackle the tough stuff?
Amy: Ha! Perhaps I’m a masochist? (Kidding!!) That’s a great question, actually. And it may sound kind of cheesy to say, but I really do believe that all the growth I’ve ever experienced in my life has been rooted in the tough things I’ve gone through, so that’s what interests me. How characters develop as a result of a significant event - especially how we, as women in our culture, are faced with so many challenges and what we do to rise up and face them every day. Anne Lamott says, “There’s no point in writing hopeless novels. We all know we’re going to die; what’s important is the kind of men and women we are in the face of this," and I think that’s why I write the books I do. How we tackle what life throws our way is what defines who we are - and exploring those kinds of journeys is the work that brings me joy; finding a way to see hope in the darkest of circumstances is such a powerful quality for characters to discover within themselves.
I also think that writing about the tough stuff helps readers (and me!) feel maybe a little less alone in whatever we struggle with. To read something and feel, “Oh, I’m not the only person to ever have those thoughts/feelings,” brings about a sense of connection that I cherish when I read other authors’ works. And that’s the fundamental reason I write - to connect.
Me: When you have time to read, who are your favorite authors to read?
Amy: Oh, there are too many to list! But I never miss anything by Jennifer Weiner, Emily Giffin, or Elizabeth Berg. I also love Joyce Maynard, Elizabeth Strout, T. Greenwood, Sarah Pekkanen…the list goes on and on! I read mostly commercial and literary women’s fiction, though Laura Hillenbrand’s UNBROKEN was the last non-fiction piece I dove into. She is a phenomenal woman, and I hugely admire her work.
Me: You've got two more books coming -- what are they about?
Amy: Yes! OUTSIDE THE LINES is due out in February, 2012, and tells the story of a woman searching for her homeless and mentally ill father, whom she has been estranged from for twenty years. It’s told in alternating viewpoints of both the daughter and father, past and present, which was a departure for me as a writer and I am very pleased with how it turned out.
The one I’m currently working on is as yet unnamed. It explores what happens when a woman is suddenly and unexpectedly thrust into the role of full-time mother and is forced to confront the complicated reasons behind her previously hard-fast decision to remain childless.
Me: Thanks Amy for sharing your amazing novel and your life with us! And I can’t wait to read your next novels!
To enter to win Best Kept Secret, share one of your best kept secrets – it can be funny – you don’t have to make it serious in order for you to enter to win the book! One of my best kept secrets is that when my husband is out of town, I will keep the house a total mess until like an hour before he is supposed to be home, then we all rush around to whip the house into shape. I’m like the mom who is really the babysitter – let the kids stay up late, we eat junk food, watch bad TV, go out for ice cream and pizza all of the time! Then when Dad gets home from being out of town, it’s time to be the real mom again!
What’s your best kept secret?!

O you are so sneaky, getting this posted while I was sleeping; I've been watching & waiting for your first Blast O-Book interview!!!
Secret? Hmmmm.... Probably how badly my husband treated me. I cared for him while he was dying and that in itself isolated me from nearly everyone because I had no *time*, but because of medication and dementia he was often abusive and cruel, and I was embarrassed and ashamed to let my family know this. (Yeah, it will go into my book, and I totally understand what Amy said about personal growth being rooted in what one has gone through.)
My best kept secret is that I want to move out of Chicago. The weather here is terrible. I don't tell anyone that I want to move somewhere else because this is where my entire family lives. We will never move away from everyone.

My best kept secret is the hidden chocolate I have that my son or husband don't know about :)
I absolutely love your best kept secret! What a fun mom you are! My best kept secret is I failed my last statistics class in graduate school and did not graduate on time. I found out less than 24 hours from graduation so I didn't tell many people that I didn't graduate. BUT last Friday I actually did finish it. So all's well that ends well :)
I think it's just some of my frustrations as a mother. I stay at home, but don't always love it (or even want to). I love my kids, but some days the thought of being with them makes me insane.

Well if I told you it wouldn't be my best kept secret, now would it? ;)
How about I just tell you a secret? I secretly hate when other women tell me how they couldn't be a sahm 'cause they crave the social to much...drives me nuts. As if I don't. I crave it too, I'll talk to anyone...stranger who comes knocking on my door beware I will talk to you all day if you let me! lol. I'm so sick of barney, dora, elmo--I hate the songs in my head! My husband gets home and wants to talk about his day and I sit and think how wonderful it would be to talk to real grown-ups when ever you wanted. I almost never have Laura time and I miss her, oh how I miss Laura. So that is one of my secrets. I don't want to hear how people can't do it. I'm very interested in this book, because I'm not a drinker but I'm an eater. I have put my little kids in the car (I have 4 total ranging 20, 14, 4, 2) and cracked open a diet coke and a chocolate bar thinking take me away for just a few mins take the edge off the stress I'm feeling having just finished grocery shopping with screaming kids. And when mine are good and some other women is struggling with a screaming kid I want to hug her and say it's ok your not along.
My best kept secret? Hm...
Everyone in my family has been telling me for years I need to write a book or keep a blog. While I haven't written a book yet, I have been keeping a blog for two months and no one in my family knows about it.
My best kept secret - when I get stressed out and overwehlmed, I CRY. I go into a room, lock the door and all out SOB. Maybe happens once a year or once every other year, but it's therapeutic for me and I feel a ton better afterwards. This book sounds like a great read - thanks so much for doing these contests, it's really fun to learn about all of the great books out there :)
This book really speaks to me ~ I've been through those days and through the mercy of God and self-control can enjoy a drink in moderation; but I was probably teetering on the brink there for a while when I got divorced and was left with 3 young kids.
My BKS would probably be that when my husband is out of town, like you MM, we have movie marathons, sleep overs, eat ice cream before dinner and in general PARTY!! Kids and I love it and we always right the ship just before he walks in the door. :)
Thanks MM!!
My best kept secret is that I really hate my best friend's fiance. He is a worthless drunk and she can do so much better. I didn't say anything when she got engaged because I thought for sure it wasn't going to last. But now she is having his baby and it is too late for me to say anything. I fear she is ruining her life :(
My best kept secret? It would be that I'm not the super easy going, relaxed mom that everyone thinks I am-my kids know I'm a yeller, & I do it way more than I should.
I HAVE had best kept secrets...until I tell someone. I guess my WORST kept secret is that I have a hard time keeping (my own) secrets.
My best kept secret? I'd kind of like to move to Ireland.... but shh don't tell my mom.
I don't wash my hair every day. But I do shave my legs!
With this crappy economy we are on a VERY tight budget. We take our lunches to work...no eating out. But on occasion I will stop at a fast food chain for the dollar menu.

My BKS would probably have to be that my husband is very anti letting our son sleep in our bed. However, anytime he works late at work, I'll bring our son to bed with me...my husband will move him back to his bed and in the morning say, "Did you know Avery came into our room last night?"! :)
kndyer
My best kept secret? That's just for me...another secret is that I sneak junk food (fast food, candy, etc.) when my boyfriend's not around and then I only make healthy food at home. :)
My best kept secret is that I can't stand my sister in law! She was lingering on the fringe of my brother's friends forever- he dated and was in love with HER best friend. After a few serious and damaging heartbreaks, there she was again. I truly feel my brother settled thinking he wouldn't find anyone. Wow, that felt good to share- I could never say anything to my family.

My secret is that I have a blog.

Hope this isn't too late.... My best kept secret is that I pretty bad a spelling, however everyone I know thinks I'm great at it... Spell-check!
It is till such a well kept secret I wo't say it here!
my BKS is that i live with my boyfriend who is my company's biggest client and no one at work knows that we're together. we've been a couple for nearly 4 years, we bought our house two years ago this month and all of this has been done under the radar!
I can't tell you... that's why it's a secret! haha! I really would have to think hard about this one. The best I can come up with is wanting out of my current job and into a job I love. I am thankful for my job, its not bad, its just not what I would LOVE to be doing. Great interview!!

Well love the new mantra! It is words to live by really! ok my best kept secret is that I'd really love to go back to school to get my RN. Whenever any one asks I act like it isn't a big deal and not a real priority but deep down I'd really love to do it! And I plan to start when my daughter goes to kindergarten! :)
My best kept secret...that I read books out of the kid section at the library. It's not the biggest secret, but it's pretty good.
AND....
Our county library is going to start charging annual fees, so our lame city library will have to do this summer.
My best kept secret is a diary/journal that is well hidden from eyes and I write whatever I feel in it. Lyrics,random thoughts etc. It helps to get out those emotions once in a while.

My bid is that when my hubby is out of town I take my self on dates. Whether it's go out shopping or make my self a fabulous dinner, I do it for me.
Oh yeah, and I want to open a bakery!
My best kept secret is that every Saturday when my husband is spending the day with his friends in stead of doing something around the house or spending with me (which I used to let bother me) I now look forward to as a time to forget housework and all but basic needs for me and the kids. He thinks it is still an issue with me, but I figure if he is going to goof off for one whole day per week then I deserve the same time off. When you are a stay at home mom you can't leave the work and stress at the office it's always there. I realized that it's ok to let things go for a day and as long as the kids are fed and safe then the day is good. The rest of the day is mine to decompress.
sounds like an amazing book! count me in!
my bks...my husband and i keep a list of all the crazy things we find funny. we've been doing this ever since we started dating and haven't stopped. i give him a printout of the list on our wedding anniversary and we look back and laugh at all our inside jokes.
Hmm, this one is hard. but I'm sure everybody does it...like sneak ice cream behind my daughter's back because I don't want to have any or even from my friends and co-workers because I'm suppose to be on a diet.
This was actually the secret I kept for the longest time. I finally told my brother and parents a few years back...When we were younger, my brother had a BB gun and we would go outside to play with it. One day we were outside with one of my brother's friends and I thought I would see if I could hit the neighbor's van. I never heard the BB's hit so I kept shooting. Come to find out, I had been shooting the windshield. My brother in his friend got in trouble for it and had to work all summer to pay for a new windshield.

My best kept secret...or at least I thought it was until people started calling me on it is that I have this inner 16 year old inside me that wants to still watch tween movies and tv shows even at 32! LOL!
I have a deeeeeeep love for Reese pb cups. Each Sunday morning I get Up before my husband and kids and enjoy one with a cup of tea....in the quiet morning hours.
My BKS... I hate the small town my husband and I live in. It's his dream to live here and I secretly fear he will never want to move!
my best kept secret, which i guess only about 2 people know is that i am totally always afraid of losing my job. always.
It would be that I'm not the super mom that my mother thinks I am. My little one knows, but she loves me too peices anyway! I expect way too much from a 3 year old... plus I am yeller when she won't listen, & I do it way more than I should.
xx(fingers crossed)

Don't tell anyone, but sometimes I cry on the way into work. My daughter has a heart condition & I'm afraid one day I'll get that horrifying phone call and not make it home in time.
My best kept secret is similar to your example. First, I do that too, when my husband is gone I'm a slob until he gets home (except we don't have children so I don't have any accomplices like you). But my actual secret is that when my husband is out of town I let our dogs sleep in the bed with me. My husband absolutely refuses to let them sleep with us BUT when the cat's away, the mice will play...
Thanks for doing another book giveaway, maybe I'll win one this time!

I am afraid of finding a job. There, I said it. I am dying to teach my own classroom again but after being pink slipped so many times I am afraid that I am one of those horrible teachers that people talk about. I haven't told anyone that while I apply for everything I am terrified that I am just no good.
Carly Haynes
my best kept secret...I'm really a man! ;)
My secret is that I have to sleep with a pillow on my side because I have a fear of having my back exposed when I sleep. Too scared of getting stabbed or something. If my husband is out of town then I have to sleep with two pillows to block both sides. It makes no sense in my logical mind, but I need those pillows! Melissa Rem
My best kept secret is that I LOVE cheesey movies! I don't think anyone knows though...except you, now!
My best kept secret is that I do the happy dance when there is no one home but me. I enjoy a night here and there where there is no commotion, just quiet and I probably look a lot like Elaine dancing on Seinfeld.

My secret is that I am lonely. I am very outgoing on the outside, but not so much on the inside. I am usually so busy with my kids that the neighbors/friends never invite me to the pool, girls night out, etc. and then my feelings get hurt. I am getting divorced and my boys will be gone before too many more years, and I fear I will be all alone. LeslieCG
Best Kept Secret? hmmmm, it is so secret, I forgot. Guess I should have told someone so they could help me remember. =)
Super excited for the June Blast-O-Books! Thanks!!
I'd have to say how much time I waste on the internet durring the day.
My best kept secret from people in real life is how much not having a baby kills me every day. I never told any of my family when I had either of my miscarriages. I feel that things like that need to be kept private, which then makes it worse for me to go it alone.

I'm still in love with my old boyfriend!
My close friends know this but I pretend that I don't care about him anymore. Sigh.
Dani Patarazzi
My best kept secret is my irrational fear of the dark. And subsequently, the "boogie man" under my bed.
my bks is that i will be 30 in november...and i have never had sex. so many of my good friends don't even know that about me.
My best kept secret as of lately is that I am nervous that we are having a boy (due in 6 weeks and we don't know what we are having). Don't get me wrong, I'm over the moon to be pregnant with our second (since it took a long time to get to this point), but I don't know how to raise a boy (if we have a boy). Our oldest is a girl and is all girlie and I have 5 years worth of girl stuff. Having a boy scares me...but then again so does have a another girl that is full of drama. I'm hoping these are normal feelings. ha! :)
My best kept secret is that I can drink most people under the table :)
Hey - my best kept "secret" is the Green Tea flavored Kit Kats that one can buy at the Japanese Supermarket - which makes me think it is more "healthful" than the regular milk chocolate ones (but probably not, in reality)

My best kept secret is how badly I've wanted to have another baby but know my husband really doesn't want another one.
My bks is that I desperately want to have a child but i pretend to be okay with the fact that it will probably never happen because of my infertility.
These comments are all so fabulous! I had the best time doing this interview for Stephanie!
And let's see, it wouldn't be fair if I didn't leave a secret, too... Okay, are you ready? I am so nervous about this book release that even though I have been "off" sugar for over 9 months, I hit Dairy Queen on Friday for a Brownie Batter Blizzard and INHALED IT in about ten seconds flat. Totally worth it, and totally made me feel better. Perhaps I need a carbohydrate intervention, now? :)
Thank you all for the interest, and please let me know your thoughts about the book!
My best kept secret is Self-Tanner night. My husband plays basketball on Thursday nights, religiously. Afterward he goes out with the guys and doesn't come home until long after I'm in bed. This is the night I slather myself head-to-toe in stinky self tanner and then put on my grubby, black pajamas (that stuff gets EVERYWHERE). It is too streaky and freaky looking to use when he's around--we've been married a loooooong time but the guy doesn't deserve to have to look at THAT! He's never noticed or mentioned it (and since I only do it once a week it's not like I'm ridiculously George Hamilton-tan or anything). I realize this isn't exactly the axe-murder sort of skeleton in my closet, but I find it hilarious.
My secret is the same as a few others. I'm a sahm and not really the best at it. I try but I too am a yeller and not proud.
One of my best kept secrets is that I am HORRIBLE with doing laundry! When my husband does it he separates the lights, darks, delicates, etc. and makes sure not to cram too much in one load. He also carefully measures out the detergent, color safe bleach, etc. Me, I reach deep into the laundry baskets and shove whatever I grab into the washer...as much as will fit. Before the clothes go in I just pour some of this, some of that in to clean :). My husband caught me doing this not that long ago and acted horrified...I told him if he didn't like how I did it he could do it himself :).

my best kept secret is that I spilled a LOT of water on my laptop keyboard. My husband thought that it just started making this police-siren sound when it starts and deciding not to let me type "1" on the right side numbers. He blames Facebook, which he thinks causes viruses, but hasn't made the connection that the remote broke on the very same day...
I guess my best kept secret is that i'm not okay with being single as i let everyone else think. While i'm enjoying my me time, i get lonely from time to time and am jealous as all my friends are married and having kids.
my secret is that i really want to be a stay at home mom when i have kids someday..and i want it to be soon!
My best kept secret is that I do not like one of my co-workers! I am cordial with her but that is about it. I do not engage her in casual conversation like I do the rest of my co-workers. This woman always has to involve herself in everything which is very annoying. She also always has to make a comment, regardless of the fact that she does not know what we are talking about or that she is wrong!
My best kept secret is that I LOVE when my hubby goes out of town for business!! I don't have to worry with making dinner every night..the kids and I eat out the entire time!
Best kept secret... I listen to books on tape while I'm working... and might not answer the phone because the book got to a good part.

my best kept secret is I AM A NOSEY WOMAN!!!!!!

This book sounds great! I'm definitely going to add it to my list. My best kept secret? Hmmm... I guess it would be just how antisocial I really am. I would much rather sit at home on the couch with my husband watching old Scrubs reruns than go out with a group of people. I really get overwhelmed around lots of people, even friends.
Its a secret. And best kept.
This looks like a great book. My best kept secret is that I always look at the homes for sale, even though we are not planning to move.MargieT
My best kept secret is that I'm afraid that even though I know all the right things to do, I am really a horrible teacher. I'm afraid that the other teachers in my grade and subject are doing a much better job and my students aren't learning or retaining as much.
I hide my favorite candy up on a shelf in the back of my closet. Sometimes I just don't like to share!
Hi Manic...thanks so much for offering up this book. I have a very close friend dealing with this exact issue right now. She even tried rehab to no avail. I am so sad for her...she desperately wants to quit drinking! Anyway, I guess a secret about me would be how badly I want to go back to school and get a degree. At 41yo this is TERRIFYING! Not sure if I'll ever do it...I keep finding reasons not to. :) Take Care MM!! Nan
My best kept secret is that even though I complain about being single and not being able to find Mr. Right - I secretly like being able to do whatever I want, whenever I want without checking in with anyone. I also love having the whole bed to myself! Not that I want to be single forever, but for now it's kind of nice! :)
I think at least once every day about ditching my family and running away. I never would because I love them, but it's exhausting to be a full time employee, mother, wife, cook, maid, chauffer, personal shopper, etc. I never have me time or get to do or buy something for myself.
Kristi Marie
My best kept secret is that I spend way too much time on my computer. I use the excuse that I am "working", but half the time I am on facebook or reading tabloid gossip. It's one of the reasons I won't get an IPhone or Blackberry...I'm afraid I'll never get offline!
Probably that I'm disappointed almost every day. Sad, but true. I really have to work to be happy. :( ktmixon315
I work in a profession where you are expected to be pleasant, happy and helpful to the random people who come in every day, and I'm always told ow pleadant, happy, and helpful I am. My secret is that I am not a people person and that I feel like slapping most of the people I help because their problems are trivial.
My best kept secret is that I sneak off and eat candy when my kids aren't paying attention. (I also do the bad babysitter thing when my husband is out of town - glad I'm not the only one!)
My BSK is going to remain a secret from all but the other two people involved (keep your minds out of the gutters) but I am dying to share it with someone!
Instead, I'll share that even though I'm a quiet person, I'm totally a yeller with my kids, although my neighbors probably know that. :)
Terri M.
My best kept secret??? Unfortunately, I don't have any because I have what my husband calls "no filter". He wishes I had secrets!!
-tmd636
My Best Kept Secret is I love to sneak away and grab a quick nap before the kids get home from school. Of course, I am up before they walk through the door. Now that school is out things will be different!! lol
My best kept secret is that I love to read YA ... even though I am in my 30s!!
My best kept secret... The reason I rarely drink alcohol is because I grew up as the child of an alcoholic parent.
I would love to read this book!
My best kept secret is that I have absolutely no desire to have kids. I like kids, I have nieces and nephews that I adore, and love my friends kids, but, under no circumstances do I want any of my own. My husband and I are totally selfish; we like our freedom and the ability to do what we want when we want to. I think some people we meet think we don't have any (we've been married for 10 years) because of reproductive issues. No, we don't have any because we don't want any. It's a great thing if that's what you want, but, we don't. My freedom and ability to sleep far outweighs any desire to have children.
I had doubts right before my wedding but wasn't strong enough to call it off or delay it. We have been married almost 38 years so I guess it worked out okay.
My best kept secret is that I call the girl who considers me her Best Friend Ever my shopping and eating friend. No where near my BFF.
My best kept secret is that I have pawned some jewelry my husband has bought me over the years when we were low on cash. He just thinks I never wear it anymore, that I am more in to "costume jewelry" now.
My best kept secret is my ever growing book collection. Lol. My hubby is clueless as to really how large my collection is. Lol...It is an addiction but a GOOD one. ;)
My best kept secret is that I read books like you post here at work, haha. It's bad but I love chic lit books so much. I hide my book under my desk and look at it every so often.
Thanks!

BKS? Well, I don't keep secrets very often. That way I don't have to remember what I said...everyone else does! Heh! Maybe what I haven't told a friend of mine is that I really don't like her husband. I don't think he likes me either so guess it makes us even? And the truth is that I don't even care to make nice with him. It means I don't spend much time with her anymore, which is kind of sad.
My best kept secret is that I get lonely sometimes because I live far from my family but I play it off so most people think it doesn't bother me that much.
my best kept secret will remain just that...a SECRET
That I'm 38 and haven't figured out what I want to do with my life or what I'm good at. I seem to fake things pretty well.
BKS: sometimes I wish I *had* changed my major and become a teacher. but the economy is so bad and teachers are being laid off...I guess things worked out for the best.

My best kept secret is that I can't wait until my oldest moves into her own apartment and starts her "adult" life in a few days. I love her, but I really need her to be independent.
Hmmm.... I stress shop. It's bad! On the upside I have nice jewelry. On the downside I have some bills I wish would go away.
I don't think I have a best kept secret...I'm an open book (aka I share TMI!) Not to copy your secret, but similarly, every time my husband travels (which is often), the kids and I always pick one night to forfeit our typically healthy dinners and have big plates of chipped beef gravy and biscuits instead.

My best kept secret is that I do not shave my legs from october til march. I have not very hairy legs and usualyl do not need to shave for that long but no one knows that.
I talk about eating healthier, but I sneak off and buy junk food when I am having a bad day. Patticole
I eat so much sugar when my husband is out of town.
My best kept secret is......best kept secret!
SPepper22
Probably my journal that i've had for 5 years. I only write in it when I'm really stressed and at my breaking point. I should write in it more often to get frustration out but I can never find the time.

Your interview was GREAT MaNiC! I can't wait to read this book! Thank you so much!...
I wish I had some secrets to share... thinking thinking thinking - BUT I got nothing!
Sorry!

My best kept secret is that I am a magazine hoarder. I get so many magazines every month that it sometimes will take me a year to read them. I bring them into work so that my husband cannot see how many I get and read them on my breaks.
That I want another baby. :) But we made that decision permanent (husband had the Big V), so if I love my marriage, and I do, I will keep this secret, and be happy with my wonderful sons.
My best kept secret is that I'm terrified of being alone and never finding someone to share my life with...
NicoleMG from CT
My biggest secret is that I kissed a girl when I was younger. I know this is more accepted now, but I was in my early teens and both of us were in a really strict religion. Oops! lol
I want to read this book and have been racking my brain for days about my best kept secret. I can't think of a thing. Pitiful!

PBS: 10 minutes with Ron Paul0
A great interview from PBS that covers the common objections to the man, why his solutions are more efficient and effective than those proposed by government and what a Ron Paul presidency might look like.

Anonymous…Enlightenment1
For me, this again comes back to the tale of Barabbas and Jesus.
Barabbas was a brave man and zealot of Roman-occupied Jerusalem. A caring man and a patriot he dealt with a daily menace of pain, corruption, thievery and much worse at the hands of the Roman occupiers who reigned over Jerusalem.
We too have modern “Romans” all around us; a mixed bag of mega-corporations, control-freak politicians, “the illuminati,” the vatican and a multitude of others. They have wronged and sinned and abused us for a very long time—thanks to the internet more people are aware of their crimes now than in any time in history.
The group(s) that can steer these “aware” people will have their hands upon the controls of a massively powerful weapon with the dangerous cloak of self-righteousness draped around its hulking shoulders. As history has shown, many of the worst atrocities have been carried out with the best intentions…
While most people today associate “enlightenment” with buddhism, new age ramblings or meditation; the words of Christ still ring with more clarity, peace and wisdom than I have heard from any other source: “love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you!”
His eyes saw a different world; his mind didn’t react like the mind of men, his heart didn’t beat with the violent passion of ours—he surpassed all of that…
Luke 23:34
“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”
Matthew 18:21-35
“Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?” Jesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.”
Mathew 6:14-15
“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.”
With these thoughts in mind, I don’t know what action I can now take and I don’t know what action you should take; all I know is that there is a perfect Creator, the most powerful channel I’ve yet found to the source is Jesus Christ, and no matter how bad things might seem in the short-term, God is playing chess and everything is being worked steadily and precisely to The Good and like iron being forged into steel burned by fire for our perfecting.
So if your heart still beats with righteous indignation and anger, hungers for offensive action to “take ‘them’ down” by any means necessary, and you think the time for forgiveness has passed then fare thee well, perhaps our paths will cross again someday.
I don’t pretend to know The Will of God, or what the right action to take is; but starting off your movement with “We do not forget, we do not forgive” is a very dangerous thing indeed.
Their latest video…
State of the Union2
There is a great and terrible kingdom being brought to the ground while the next age of our humanity is coming into focus. What will it be like? How can we remain harmonious with the will of God in bringing it to fruition?
Obviously there have been a lot less posts on here lately, frankly I’ve been at a lack of words while trying to find what it is that I want to say.
I used to find anything intriguing or inspiring and make that an article but now I find myself torn between angles, philosophies and spiritual ideals…
I’ve been thinking long and hard about what Jesus was meaning when he said he had a much different way than what the religious/political zealots offered through political action.
In my limited understanding, Jesus proposed and offered this “different way” that could create the Kingdom of Heaven here on Earth. In part, this different way was a working of peace in our hearts and minds that transcended the hatred, fear and angst the political landscape of his time was causing. A different way that involved forgiving our enemies, coming to peace with them, and even loving them and wishing them well—a very difficult task!
The strongman Barrabas continues to play in my mind as the passionate patriot striving to better the world with his good intentions but remaining far away from the true kingdom: love and self-sacrifice.
How do we effect change while remaining within the good Graces of God? Is this too high of a goal? Let’s dare to dream it is not.
A “Sovereign Man” in court0
As I continue my journey into the strange world of admiralty law and common law I am forced to deal with situations far beyond my comprehension. The below video is a major example of my dilemma. I can’t see how they are fakes—and they bring up major debates on how our court system operates and the possible abuses taking place.
Jesus or Barabbas?3
I’m going to say just briefly here, that Jesus and Barabbas can be seen as two very different types of “Christians” to be revealed in the end of the age; those, who in the midst of great persecution and tribulation will demonstrate the love of the Father through the wisdom of the Cross (the laid down life of Jesus Christ), and those who will rise up as Barabbases – even as “Christian” militant zealots of the day who will think that their ungodly actions and behavior are justified in their fight against a distinctly antichrist system of government.
Even now, by the Spirit, we can see a polarization of these two very different types of people; those “Christians” who are heavily “churched” and who have much zeal and religious ambition but who bear not much fruit of the Spirit in their lives, and those who are really taking up their crosses, so much so that they are coming to a place where they love people with the whole of their hearts, and that, even to the extent that they will lay down their very lives for others when it is the lead of the Holy Spirit to do so.
Beloved, even now we are seeing many people who claim to be “Christian” but who, by their words and actions, show more of Barabbas than they do of Jesus. With their mouths these say “Give us Jesus!” but with their hearts they clearly express, “Give us Barabbas! We choose Barabbas!!”
I’ve seen some pretty awful things done and said in the name of Jesus Christ before, but even those things, I’m afraid, are nothing when compared to what is coming. It was the spirit of religion at work in unsanctified hearts that crucified our Lord Jesus Christ, and I imagine that it will be the very same spirit at work in men that will crucify us also (in whatever form that might come).
Beloved, look to the left of Barabbas in the picture below, and there you will see a very small figure with the glory of God upon Him. He is demonstrating there the wisdom of the Cross to rulers and authorities in heavenly places, which is our destiny too, beloveds, IF we will just walk this thing out in the very footsteps of the Lord Jesus Christ. — D

NAME
xawtv-remote, v4lctl -- control video4linux devices
SYNOPSIS
xawtv-remote [ options ] command v4lctl [ options ] command
DESCRIPTION
xawtv-remote and v4lctl can be used to control a video4linux driven TV card. xawtv-remote passes the command to a already running xawtv or motv instance using X11 properties. v4lctl sets the parameters directly.
OPTIONS
xawtv-remote knows the following options: -h print a short help text -d dpy Set the X11 display -i id Set the Window ID. v4lctl understands these options: -h print a short help text -c device Set video4linux device. -D driver Set video4linux driver. -v n Set debug level to n, where n = [0..2]
COMMANDS
Both tools basically use the same set of commands. Some of them are useful for xawtv-remote only (fullscreen for example). setstation [ <name> | <nr> | next | prev | back ] Set the TV station. This selects on of the TV stations which are configured in the .xawtv config file. The argument can be the station name or a number (the first one listed in the config file is 0, ...). next/prev jumps to the next/previous station in the list, back to the previously selected one. setchannel [ <name> | next | prev ] Tune in some channel. setfreqtab <table> Set the frequency table. See the menu in xawtv for a list of valid choices. setnorm <norm> Set the TV norm (NTSC/PAL/SECAM). setinput [ <input> | next ] Set the video input (Television/Composite1/...) capture [ on | off | overlay | grabdisplay ] Set capture mode. volume mute on | off mute / unmute audio. volume <arg> color <arg> hue <arg> bright <arg> contrast <arg> Set the parameter to the specified value. <arg> can be one of the following: A percent value ("70%" for example). Some absolute value ("32768"), the valid range is hardware specific. Relative values can be specified too by prefixing with "+=" or "-=" ("+=10%" or "-=2000"). The keywords "inc" and "dec" are accepted to and will increase and decrease the given value in small steps. setattr <name> <value> Set set the value of some attribute (color, contrast, ... can be set this way too). show [ <name> ] Show the value current of some attribute. list List all available attributes with all properties (default value, range, ...) snap [ jpeg | ppm ] [ full | win | widthxheight ] <filename> Capture one image. webcam <filename> Capture one image. Does basically the same as "snap jpeg win <filename>". Works also while avi recording is active. It writes to a temporary file and renames it when done, so there is never a invalid file. movie driver [ files | raw | avi | qt ] movie video [ ppm | pgm | jpeg | rgb | gray | 422 | 422p | rgb15 | rgb24 | mjpeg | jpeg | raw | mjpa | png ] movie fps <frames per second> movie audio [ mono8 | mono16 | stereo ] movie rate <sample rate> movie fvideo <filename> movie faudio <filename> movie start movie stop control xawtv's movie recorder. fullscreen Toggle fullscreen mode. showtime Display time (same what the 'D' key does in xawtv). msg text Display text on the on-screen display (window title / upper left corner in fullscreen mode). vtx line1 line2 [ ... ] Display subtitles. It pops up a small window at the bottom of the screen. It is intended to be used as an interface for displaying subtitles (often on videotext page 150 in Europe, that's why the name) by external programs. Every command line argument is one line, zero lines removes the window. You can colorize the text with the control sequence "ESC foreground background". foreground/background has the range 0-7 (ansi term colors). Example: "\03347 hello world " is blue on white. "\033" must be a real escape character, the string doesn't work. With the bash you'll get it with ^V ESC. vtx does also understand the ANSI tty escape sequences for color. quit quit xawtv keypad n enter digit 'n'. That's the two-digit channel selection, entering two digits within 5 seconds switches to the selected station. Useful for lirc. vdr command send "command" to vdr (via connect on localhost:2001).

This format is similar to the AFMT_S16_BE format but with different endianess. This is the native 16 bit sample format (signed short) in the wintel architecture. It's also the 16 bit sample format used in WAV files. This makes this the most commonly used audio format in the computer industry. Practically all devices support this format natively (there are few exceptions used in the RISC workstations).
This is the preferred format to be used when storing 16 bit samples in files or when passing them to some applicatiions or systems.
The AFMT_S16_LE formatted data stream should be handled as an array of bytes. Each 16 bit big endian sample requires two byte positions. The first byte stores the least significant 8 bits and the the second is used for the most significant part.
The AFMT_S16_NE endian format is recommended instead of AFMT_S16_LE as the internal sample format. It's also the best choice if the application supports just one sample format.

Law degrees
United States
Law school in the United States is a postgraduate level program which typically lasts three years and results in the awarding of the
Juris Doctor
(J.D.) degree. Some schools in Louisiana concurrently award the Graduate Diploma in Civil Law (D.C.L.). In order to be admitted to a United States American Bar Association (ABA) approved law program, a prospective student must take the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and have graduated with a minimum four-year undergraduate (bachelor's) degree in any major. Currently, there are 199 ABA-approved law schools.
Canada
The typical degree to practice law in Canada is the
Bachelor of Laws
, which requires previous college coursework and is very similar to the first law degree in the United States, except universities such as the
University of Toronto
,
Osgoode Hall Law School
,
Queen's University
,
The University of Western Ontario
, and
University of British Columbia
have changed the name of their degree to that of a J.D.., education,. . Some universities have developed joint Canadian LL.B and American J.D programs, such as York University and New York University, the University of Windsor and the University of Detroit Mercy, and the University of Ottawa and Michigan State University program..
Asia
China.
Japan
In Japan, a law degree is usually an undergraduate qualification, with the LL.B. being the most common. To practice law, passing the National Bar Examination and attending judicial training (or work experience as legislator, government official, professor, etc.) are required in Japan. While ‘Graduate School of Law’, which confer LL.M. and LL.D., has long been for few students pursuing academic career (partly for policy career), ‘Law School’ with much larger capacity was additionally introduced for students pursuing legal career in 2004 by legislation according to Recommendations of the Justice System Reform Council, and it is now in its transitional stage. LL.M. degree usually requires two-year study.
Philippines.
South Korea
On July 3, 2007, the
Korean National Assembly
passed legislation introducing 'Law School', closely modeled on the American post-graduate system.
Moreover, naturally, since March 2, 2009, 25 (both public and private) 3-year professional
Law Schools
that officially approved by
Korean Government
, has been opened to teach future Korean lawyers. The first bar test to the lawschool graduates will be scheduled in 2012.

Controversies

law firms
in several cities across the country in 2008 is
US$
160,000 plus bonus.
and the
New York. As more students choose where to work based on the firms' diversity rankings, firms face an increasing market pressure in order to attract top recruits.
Increase in law school tuition fees
Furthermore, there has been some controversy regarding the recent increases in law school tuition fees, at a time when salaries in the legal services sector are growing much more slowly than the U.S. inflation rate.
Some attribute these issues to insufficient regulation of law schools by the American Bar Association. The total number of Juris Doctor degrees awarded has been on the rise in recent years, at least partially due to the accreditation of new schools by the ABA.
Continued increase in number of law schools
The United States continues to open new law schools at a time when it already has more than 900,000 lawyers, risking an excess of supply.
In addition, to become a licensed attorney in
California
, one need not have attended law school.
Yet California has 69 law schools (20 ABA-approved, 18 California-bar approved and 31 unaccredited schools).
California serves as the headquarters for some of the more well-known online law schools, such as
California School of Law
and
Concord Law School
.
There are 11 law schools in the Greater Chicago Area (Loyola, DePaul, NIU, U of IL, U. of Chicago, Notre Dame, IIT, John Marshall, Marquette, Valparaiso, Northwestern). New York was recently described as having a 'glut' of law schools,).
Alternative legal education systems
Many potential law students cannot attend a residential law school due to work or family commitments, not to mention the financial burden of tuition and travel. An online law school may be a good option for such students. For a balanced discussion of the pros and cons of an online legal education, and a comparison of the pedagogy and First Year Law Student Exam results of the online law schools "registered" (not "accredited") with the California State Bar, go to..
Australia
In
Australia
, law schools such as the
Sydney Law School
and the
University of Melbourne
have emphasised a combination of the British and American systems, prominently known in Australia for their prestige and proliferate employment rate.
However, other universities such as the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University, Monash University and Deakin University are known for their intensive and practical work.

- AP: . … Industry estimates show the Marcellus boom could offer robust job numbers for 50 years. … U.S. Steel will add 100 jobs with a $100 million upgrade of a plant that makes seamless pipe for the construction, oil-gas exploration and production industries. (Associated Press, 11/27/11)
- Marcellus Multiplier Having a “Driving Force” on Local Economy: continue to do so. “There were a number of businesses that took advantage of the opportunity to be servicers to the natural gas industry,” Culp said. “There are a lot of examples of company expansions.” … As a result of the expansion to service the natural gas industry, Culp said Bolus’ company has also grown. “He’s gone from 80 people, in the early part of the year, to 160,” Culp said. “Most of it is directly related to those (Marcellus shale-related) operations.” …Culp said the “area of impact” of the shale industry is also continuing to expand.

- Ohio Co. Official: “America Needs American-Made Energy and Jobs”: A new ethane gas pipeline that would come through Licking County would create jobs and help stimulate the economy, county Commissioner Tim Bubb said. “It’s a big construction project,” he said. “It will create jobs. … America needs American-made energy and jobs.” … The proposed Enterprise pipeline is expected to generate as many as 4,000 temporary and full-time jobs along the route as it is being built. … “The bottom line is that we all need energy. Natural gas energy is a safe energy,” Bubb said. “It creates jobs in America.” (Newark Advocate, 11/27/11)

Ohio Landowners Sue to Break Utica Lease Contract
A group of landowners in Columbiana County, Ohio have filed a lawsuit seeking to dissolve lease agreements they say were improperly transferred from Anschutz Exploration to Chesapeake.
A group of 33 landowners in five local townships filed a lawsuit regarding their oil and gas lease rights in Columbiana County Common Pleas on Monday.
The lawsuit filed by the Canton law firm of Tzangas Plakas Mannos and Raies Ltd., involves about 3,000 acres in Wayne, Butler, West, Hanover and Salem townships. It names Chesapeake Exploration and its subsidiary, CHK Utica, as well as two land agents and three notary publics as defendants in the lawsuit.
Among several complaints, the people contend they have a right to receive the fair market value for their land and have it put to productive use in a reasonable timeframe.
The lawsuit claims Anschutz Exploration Corp. was extremely active in the area between 2008 and 2010, signing many lease agreements, which pre-dated the current knowledge by most local property owners of the new Utica Shale fracking and drilling procedures opening up additional gas. Because of this, the lawsuit contends many of the landowners were signed to leases and received less than 1 percent of the fair market value compared to current signing bonuses being paid in Columbiana County.
Several years after Anschutz Exploration signed the leases, Chesapeake sought to obtain the leases. The lawsuit alleges the lease transfers were improper, without proper notarization and ineligible to be recorded in Columbiana County, although they were.*

A few years ago, a vacation was a vacation if you were a voice talent. It had to be. Away from your home studio or the professional studio that you did all your recording in, you had no choice but to enjoy some time off.
Things are different today.
To record a voice over on the road these days all you really need is a mic, a laptop and preamp to connect those two pieces. I have a Shure X2U. It’s tiny and very portable.
Don’t Miss An Opportunity
As a professional voice talent you’re a solopreneur. That’s to say, you’re responsible for your own destiny. There are no two weeks worth of paid vacation days written into your employment agreement. Being on the road and away from the office means you’re going to miss out. You’ll have to pass on auditions. You’ll have to pass on jobs. It can be a tough pill to swallow.
But everyone needs a vacation!
Now that recording on the road is so easy, I know more and more voice actors are packing their equipment right along with the rest of their luggage. After all, you can’t afford to miss an opportunity right?
Or can you?
Working Vacation
I’m heading out tomorrow for a few days. A somewhat last minute adventure to Vegas. I thought long and hard about whether or not I should bring my gear with me.
I reasoned with myself that I’d only use it for an emergency. I wouldn’t spend any time auditioning or looking for work while I was gone. I’d just have my gear in case a client called and needed something done before I return on the weekend.
That’s just good business. Right?
I was justifying all of this in my head. A rather convincing argument, I might add.
I talked to my friend that I’m traveling with. She agreed to the proposal. She said she understood the pressure of working for yourself and not wanting to miss out on opportunities. She was genuine. If I brought my gear, she wouldn’t hassle me if I had to stop and record.
She was giving her blessing for a working vacation.
Vacation Vacation
Here’s the thing. A vacation, by it’s very definition, isn’t supposed to involve work!
Vacation: : A period spent away from home or business in travel or recreation. (Source: Merriam Webster)
I’m supposed to be getting away from business. Not bringing business with me!
I thought about it some more over the weekend and decided my gear wasn’t coming with me. Instead, I was going to get away for a few days, have some fun, enjoy the adventure, and not worry about whether or not I was missing any work.
We all need time away. Time to reset. Time to recharge. Time to renew. It makes us better people. It makes us better voice actors!
I decided that time time, I’m going on a vacation vacation!

On Monday Patch published an article about the response of Cobb school officials to the Connecticut school shootings.
The following is a statement issued by Cobb County School District Superintendent Michael Hinojosa about the same topic.
Dear Cobb County Schools Community,
We all are in shock and disbelief at the tragic event that occurred last Friday and our hearts pour out to the community of Newtown, Connecticut. As a result of this terrible, senseless act, many concerns about safety have carried over to our own community.
I want to reassure parents that Cobb County schools are as safe an environment for your children as you will find anywhere. We have state-of-the-art security resources available, including:
- Police officers assigned to every high school and middle school, and available to every elementary school on call;
- Electronic access control systems for all elementary schools;
- Surveillance cameras in every school.
In addition, all of our schools have safety plans that the principals review with their staffs at the beginning of the school year and as needed. They will be revisiting those plans this week. Finally, the school district’s Public Safety Department has requested assistance this week from all police agencies in Cobb County to step up patrols around our school buildings, so do not be surprised if you see an additional presence of police near your school.
Of course, no security measure available can protect against every conceivable threat, whether caused by nature or the rage of a disturbed individual. We must keep this random act in perspective, employ the resources we have, and be vigilant as we carry on with educating the students of Cobb County. In the aftermath of this horrible news, I want to thank our parents for reassuring their children that school is a safe place to be, and I want to thank our teachers and administrators for doing a wonderful job of comforting students and maintaining a positive and welcoming spirit in their schools.
I wish everyone a happy holiday season and a restful break, even as we grieve for those in Newtown, Connecticut.
Respectfully,
Michael Hinojosa, Ed.D.
Superintendent

I am disheartened that the world has become such that we have to have armed guards at schools. When I was in high school, the only things they had to worry about were kids smoking in the school and kids trying to leave the school grounds during school hours. I remember my last year in Osborne High School in 1970-1971, we had a new principal and he would stand at the entrance to the parking lot during lunch periods so nobody could leave without permission. We thought that was horribly mean. Now, we have armed guards in the schools. Yep, we have evolved.

“We scored late. There were five minutes of added time but we couldn’t turn it around. I think the first match was key because four goals are a lot in the Champions League, but the team were focused on trying to reach the final. We scored two goals but we could have had four or five, Higuain, Ozil and I had chances in the first half. We showed that we are better than them. We’re a bit sad because we thought we could have been in the final (…) The team fought hard and the fans were amazing,.” - Cristiano Ronaldo (video) | 30-04-13

If you have found yourself in the (un)fortunate position of having to use LinkedIn's shareArticle API to share a URL, you may notice that there is around zero articles detailing exactly how to utilize the API correctly. Even LinkedIn doesn't have an official developer support page which details exactly how to use their shareArticle API.
Too Long, Didn't Read:
Use proper meta tags and image combinations and just give LinkedIn the url parameter to their shareArticle API
Lucky for you I recently had to deal with this horribly under-documented share functionality at work and am going to outline exactly what to do to get it working!
Theoretically the shareArticle API should work like this, and actually this is how you want to use it:
You may notice that if you try this with your webpage, LinkedIn doesn't gather all the correct information about your page, or possibly it doesn't gather any information about your page except for its title and url. Where is the thumbnail? And where is the description? Lucky for you there's no documentation describing how you can get LinkedIn to pull that information save for a couple forum postings...that have no helpful information. But the shareArticle API also allows you to pass some GET params to the shareArticle API - to trick you, you see, into doing it the wrong way. For example, you can specify title, description, source and a couple other things (ooh this looks like it solves our problem!):...
Except...that if you try sending that URL to LinkedIn and your url-encoded URL is longer than approx. 700 characters, the LinkedIn script throws a Javascript error on IE6&7 on Windows XP, only! Because this is a Javascript error on the LinkedIn side, you have zero control over how it can be fixed, and if you are dealing with a dynamic length description or title, or source url, constructing this URL can be extremely problematic.
Solution
Ignore LinkedIn's red-herring extra GET parameters, and just specify the url GET parameter. This will cause LinkedIn to ping back on your URL and look for these tags (title, meta description, img...):
<html> <head> <title>The Title!</title> <meta name="description" content="This is the description of your linkedIn Article!"> </head> <body> <img src="/my/img/path.jpg"> <img src="/my/img/path2.jpg"> </body> </html>
If you're having trouble getting the images to work because your page is so cluttered, you can setup your page to skim the browser user-agent and look for 'LinkedInBot', and display an altered form of the webpage for LinkedIn specifically.

Just reading Jimbo Wales' comment on the home page of the Search Wikia project which states that "search is broken" and then goes on to say:
Why is it broken? It is broken for the same reason that proprietary software is always broken: lack of freedom, lack of community, lack of accountability, lack of transparency. Here, we will change all that.

Quite often I'll hear Readify referred to as a virtual company. The 'virtual' tag is applied to us by both internal as well as external observers - but what does it actually mean? And is it an accurate tag to apply to us?
To me the term 'virtual' means "not real" or "almost real" - certainly not something that I equate with our company. After all, it was only last week that I sat down for a meal with a bunch of our guys at Darling Harbor in Sydney. Heck, it even set me back 70 bucks... what could be more real than that? To me "virtual" is more of a SecondLife type of experience. Actually I believe that as mechanisms such as Ideagoras and Crowdsourcing start to play a bigger part in how we share knowledge that will start to see true "virtual" organizations start to take shape - maybe virtual organizations that look nothing like organizations of today but which look more like virtual swarms that exist to solve important problems and then disassemble and vaporize just as soon as they formed. But this is not anywhere near where we are at today.
I prefer to think of Readify from the viewpoint that we are highly distributed and decentralized. In this sense we are more like a "remote" (although I prefer the term "distant") company. Another, probably better term is that we are a highly mobile organization. You see, to me, "mobility" means that we are able to work from anywhere. This is closer to my real working model where I work from wherever I am at any given point in time. The slight (although significant) difference from "remote/distant" is that the latter implies that you are simply working offsite. A minor differentiation but one which is important when you live and work how I do each day!
Actually, according to this article, many more of us are at least migrating away from our ties to working from a central location. If the statistics quoted in that article are correct, 14% of the US workforce currently works "from home" at least 2 days per week. This is up from 11% in 2004 and is expected to rise to 17% within 2 years. Certainly worth considering in terms of the opportunities that will arise from this new growth.
The trick with a mobile organization is having the right tools to enable key scenarios - such as collaboration as well as communication at a human level. This article touches on some aspects of these key points.
At Readify we're experiencing all of these exciting new developments in our daily lives and it's an exciting place to be. Moving forward I can see further evolution in the mobility model. Increased mobility - and hence less dependence on location - will lead to us having:

At home I have this habit where, whenever I purchase a new article of clothing, I turf out an equivalent number of old items. Buy a new shirt - turf an old one. In with new socks, out with some old ones. New hanky in - old hanky out. You get the picture. The idea is to drive towards a wardrobe of clothes that always represent a current set based on what I prefer to wear. It's like survival of the fittest where each article of clothing has to compete to remain in the fold - although old jocks can only survive for so long .
I've started to actively do the same with my RSS subscriptions. I use the trigger of new subscriptions as a point of evaluation for items in my current subscription list. I don't unsubscribed from feeds on a pure 1-1 basis. What I do is to look at the number of items that the new feed will add to my reader each week and look to unsubscribe from a number of feeds that is representative of that number of individual reading items. This helps to ensure that the signal to noise ratio is always being fine tuned on a proper comparative basis.
Over the past 6 months I've started tuning in much more to feeds that focus on the theory knowledge management and less on individual technologies and implementation related blogs. As an example I've added blogs such as:
At the same time my interest in low level details about implementation has waned somewhat. In recent times, to match the intake from the blogs that I've listed above I've unsubscribed to some really excellent blogs about CRM, SharePoint, and design patterns:
It's not that these blogs are not a good read - they've served me extremely well in the past. It's just that, beyond a certain point, reading stuff can interfere with doing stuff. So hence the need for constant pruning and vigilance in maintaining the right level of signal to noise. By the same token, there's a couple of blogs that I've kept - mostly because they are friends - but who seldom update me with their articles these days:
Although they tend to clutter my reader I've kept a hold of them in the hope that they may one day again inspire me with their tales from the trenches

I was having lunch with a colleague today and we were talking about the economics of mass collaboration. I was talking about how knowledge is the new commodity that is driving the phenomenon of mass collaboration. My colleague mentioned that this all sounded very socialistic. We continued to bash that thought around and I knew where he was getting at... he was looking for the weakness in this model (he's very good at doing that ). The questions were taking a familiar line, basically - what is the motivation for participation? Why do people give up their spare time to contribute on these community collaborations? And can we be sure that the motivations will always be there? Then he asked a question from a viewpoint that I hadn't considered before:
Isn't it unfair on the people who are investing their time and knowledge that there are leeches who take without putting knowledge into the ecosystem?
This is a great question and one that I'm not sure that I have a great answer for straight off the bat. I'll gladly listen to the thoughts of others on this question. I guess that the real question might be... do you think that this phenomenon is nothing more than an interesting social experiment and that it will last for as long as it can capture the imagination of its participants? Or do you think that all of this new found time and exchange of intangible goods is actually coming from a true and long-lasting source of economic activity?

A while ago I mentioned the new themes that have been added to Google Portal and I thought that I'd write a quick note to talk what one of my standard days looks like these days...
In the morning I love to get up early and have a coffee with Paul Stovell while I read the paper and check my emails...
In the Dev Centre there's plenty of time in the morning for goofing around. Often Paul and I shoot water cannons at one another before we get stuck into our work...
... or practice a bit of karate...
... on other mornings it's nice to just kick back with a nice, gentleman-like game of badminton...
... the weather in Adelaide has been great so we tend to grab our sandwiches and head outside for lunch...
In the afternoon's Paul's favorite activity is water-sliding...
... but I much prefer a quiet game of croquet (Stovell never beats me at this )...
... anyway, when the day is done it's time to start preparing for the night. It's been a bit cold at night this winter so we generally prepare a bit of a fire...
... which, of course leads to marshmallows and Stovell's endless stories about his data binding feats!
.... then it's time to Sleep...
... and Dream - although I've been having some weird one's lately...
It's a busy life

Leadership is the buzzword of today and as a member of the management team at Readify, I can confirm that it's been one of our most discussed topics of the past year. We've constantly looked for ways to both reward leadership behaviors and to provide better incentives for people to exhibit them. The pursuit of leadership is not only limited to management. This year I've been given the role of managing our Professional Development (PD) program at Readify and I've already observed that it's a hot topic among the rest of our staff too. People everywhere are demanding better leadership and at the same time they want to become better leaders themselves.
This has led me to try and learn more about leadership in the hope that I might better understand the role of PD in satisfying people's hunger for leadership. Overall I suspect that the emphasis on leadership is somewhat misleading. All the talk of leadership has served to distort people's own understanding of what they are truly after. I suspect that what people really want is to achieve a sense of empowerment as well as an ability to more fully realize their own true potential.
Because of this, my emphasis for the PD program so far has been to work with people to understand their goals and what motivates them. By focusing on goals it becomes easier to tailor a program of activities that leads to the ultimate goal - to allow a person to self-actualize goals and visualize growth in their own capabilities.

Recently I managed to awaken myself to what I had previously overlooked about Web 2.0. As much as respectable magazines such as Time had tried to remind me, I'd managed to drift off into this state of Ajax'y unconsciousness. And so it was as I was using Twitter to monitor the activity of my social network when I totally jumped the shark and entered the following text into my Twitter account:
My last entry on Twitter
My last entry on Twitter
All that 1337 speak and talk of cats drove me to this moment of insanity and it happened. I just typed those words, closed my browser, and moved on. And in that single moment I proved it... I had missed the whole point of Web 2.0 applications like Twitter - which is that they are "Me" focused! To remove the noise I simply adjust the channels that I'm subscribed to and voila, problem solved. So Web 2.0 == You. Don't like something remove it; find something new of interest, add it; then rearrange the order of things until the information fits you. Then take that information and mash-it up with something else to turn it into a higher level of information and you start the process of turning raw information into knowledge.
When you think about knowledge and its value you immediately start thinking about "the enterprise" - and hence the concept of Enterprise 2.0 has come to the surface quite a bit in recent times. Mind you there's also Commerce 2.0, B2B 2.0, Security 2.0, IT Manager 2.0, and a whole raft of other * 2.0 idioms.
While I haven't explored the entire * 2.0 family my attention of late is very much centered around the concept of Enterprise 2.0 and its value to businesses. Currently there are many ideas and theories washing around in my brain about the kinds of applications and mash-ups we need to create "Me" centered applications within the enterprise. The prospects are very exciting indeed! Imagine the value to business around having an Enterprise 2.0 knowledge framework that was so powerful that employees dared not leave it for the fear that they would lose access to valuable knowledge.

I've written about Shared Items on Google Reader before but wanted to re-post because they are so cool and I wonder how many people are making use of that feature. This has drifted back to my attention after yesterday, having had a chat about them with Warren Schaefer at Melbourne airport who agrees about their coolness.
How it works is that as I'm reading items within Reader, there is a "Share" button at the bottom of each item:
As I come across articles that I think are of exceptional value I click on that button and the item is then available to be shared. By sharing the item it is available via the following link which also exposes itself as an RSS feed:
There is also a nice web part that they make available so that I can present a view of my shared items on my blog:
I'm firmly of the opinion that each of us must read some incredible articles each day and without a sharing experience such as this, then this knowledge sharing opportunity is either lost or just poorly translated as time passes waiting for me to blog about it. Clicking on a share button means that the "cream of the crop" is always shared though and so the things that I read that are valuable are available as a filtered list for people to view.
If you are interested in * 2.0 (Web, Enterprise, etc) discussions, team based development, .NET, then I'd highly encourage you to subscribe to my shared items feed because that's where you will find the best knowledge that I see each day about those topics. And if you have a Shared Items link please add it as a comment to this post so that I can subscribe to yours - in your comment please let me know what content categories your shared items are likely to contain

Yesterday I wrote an article which questions whether or not the daily Scrum meetings stifle creativity. Thankfully Richard added a comment which pointed me to an article by Martin Fowler about the Patterns of Daily Stand-up Meetings. Having been on a couple of highly functional teams in the past I can relate to much of what Martin is saying but some of it was a revelation to me and, although it's a rather lengthy article, I'd highly recommend downloading it and reading it over a coffee in an appropriately quiet place.
Reading the article actually made me wonder about the suitability of Scrum daily meetings to the Dev Centre. After all, the Scrum daily meetings are very much targeted at teams who are working on the same project whereas the Dev Centre is often a very different world. For one, the teams in the Dev Centre tend to be highly disrupted; people tend to come and go all the time. You might be working on a project in the Dev Centre today but in 2 weeks time you may not be there at all. Another significant difference is that it's actually quite common to have either very small teams or, even more commonly, just an individual developer working alone. How do you have a Scrum with just 1 regular developer? It's a highly disruptive environment and not one that I'm certain is well addressed by the "manifesto" laid out in Martin's article - particularly when you lay "remote/virtual" over the top.
I actually wonder whether the model that I'm working with is more of the norm - let's call it the "long tail" - as opposed to the large to mid-sized teams that Martin's article (and the daily Scrum meeting itself) is targeted at?
Having said all that I do know one thing... I definitely want to tap into the goodness that teams get from Scrum meetings. Shared ownership, better visibility, help with removing obstacles, team building. However this would all exist within the scope of the members of the group as opposed to distinct project teams.
Maybe there is another process which is targeted at these highly disruptive groups but which is similar to Scrum? Obviously I have more research ahead of me :-)

For the past few years nearly every project that I've been involved with has run a Scrum-like meeting. I say Scrum-like rather than Scrum because none of these projects have had a certified Scrum-master... and I don't want to weaken my argument for the rest of this article on a mere technicality Anyway, regardless of the Scrum'ness of the meetings, we do stick to those well known 3 questions that are associated with Scrum meetings:
The idea of the Scrum meeting is that you get in, ask your questions, and get out. Very robotic and very focused.
In nearly all projects I've noticed a gradual decline in the level of interest that the team has for these meetings as time progresses and I think that it has something to do with the low level nature of the information that is exchanged during these meetings. They've tended to be very task-oriented. For example:
It seems to me that the repetitive, constant, daily grind of reeling off facts breeds apathy for the process and before long these Scrum meetings become "yet another meeting". When this happens I find that teams simply go through the motions and become less agile in their thinking about raising important issues or giving you information that could change and assist the process. So how do you change it so that you get the goodness that the Scrum meeting is designed to deliver while getting good information from your team about how things are going and what needs to be done?
Up until this week I've been running daily SCRUM's in the Dev Centre but as of this morning I've decided to change it so that the weekly meetings will look more like this:
Having meetings that are structured in this way will allow senior, responsible developers to become a little more self-managing and hopefully introduce enough creativity to produce a more creative culture.
Bottom line... take the blinkers off of your team. The opportunity to gather should be a learning experience. Use those precious moments together to learn from each other as to how you can improve... who knows, maybe you'll end up with a better culture because of it!

Over the weekend I purchased 2 new books. I grabbed this one:
I'm hoping that this book will provide me with some useful tips for inspiring creativity within teams.
I also grabbed an audio CD version of this one:
I'm so in love with Wiki's at the moment that I simply had to buy this one. This is also the first audio book that I've purchased so I'm hoping that it will provide me with many hours of relaxed learning on my travels

The Dev Centre was created by Readify to manage the software development requirements of the business as well as to harvest IP from our existing processes. Last week I started the process of setting the goals of the Dev Centre for the coming year. One of the major goals for next year is to turn the Dev Centre into much more of a factory for creating software by standardizing on processes and increasing the levels of automation.
Above all of the process and automation stuff, you also have to think about the things that are at the human level - such as creating an environment that people enjoy working in. Happy, mentally-active people are productive people, and it's these people who will add the most to the culture of your business. One of the things that comes up in this area on a fairly regular basis is pair-programming. That is, people regularly ask for pair-programming to be implemented as a standard part of how we do things.
I always find this to be an interesting request because I've long been a fan of pair-programming and I can attest that my most significant programming victories have taken place through pair-programming sessions. Within Readify I can immediately recount some major pair-programming victories with Francois Beaussier, Mitch, and Paul Stovell. So the fact that there's no sign hanging above the (virtual) door of the Dev Centre certainly doesn't mean that I don't want to encourage it - I really do.
Pair programming leads to the following highly desirable benefits:
The challenges in implementing pair-programming are almost never technology or environment based but are more than likely people based.
So if it's that difficult to get workers to pair-up in a standard office environment, what about when you have teams which operate within a virtual environment? Virtual pair-programming requires not only the trigger for the developers to connect but also a set of tools that enable a rich collaboration to occur. One of the tools that we've been playing with recently that might enable richer remote pair programming scenarios is Microsoft's new SharedView Beta. This is a very exciting tool in how it provides collaborative experiences and I can easily see it becoming very often used within the Dev Centre at Readify.

Update: FrankArr tells me that the actual numbers of MS staff as at now is more like 72,000 full time staff and another 30,000 contractors... do the math on that!
Last night I wrote a post titled "Where did the time go?" In that article I did some maths to highlight just how many hours are worked each week by a small 7 person team. After writing that article I went to bed thinking about the size of Microsoft and ran the maths over their bulk. I'm not sure exactly how many employees Microsoft actually have - but for the purposes of my exercise I used 60,000 as a number for the total pool of employees and contractors. So let's look at it:
Microsoft Each day: 60,000 * 8 = 480,000 hours Each week: 480,000 * 5 = 2,400,000 hours
Microsoft
Each day: 60,000 * 8 = 480,000 hours
Each week: 480,000 * 5 = 2,400,000 hours
This company has access to 2.5 million hours of time per week! What could you do with that? Well think about it... let's say you live to be 80:
You Your entire life: 80 * 365 * 24 = 700,800 hours
You
Your entire life: 80 * 365 * 24 = 700,800 hours
If you live to be 80, and you never sleep, and you never stop working, and you are productive for every day that you are alive... you will have access to 700,000 hours. So each week, Microsoft has access to a pool of resources which represents 3.5 times the sum of your entire existence!

Time is an interesting resource. There's no way to get more of it and so we have to make do with the time that we have. You can use your time in any way that you choose but remember that whatever you choose to do with your time, that's all that you'll get.
It's very easy to get caught up with the business of things and in the process believe that you are making good use of your time - but do you ever stop to analyze what you do with yours? How much time is spent on things that don't matter? How much of the time that you spend is spent actually moving away from your goals?
As a manager of people I believe that time is something that you should always be acutely aware of. Each week I stop to think of the pool of people that I have working with me and I stop to do a quick check of the numbers:
"7 people, that's 56 hours per day. 56 hours per day multiplied by 5 gives me 280 hours this week."
"7 people, that's 56 hours per day. 56 hours per day multiplied by 5 gives me 280 hours this week."
For a team 7 people that's 280 hours per week that can be used to move closer to the company goals... or to fritter away on email and drinking coffee. Stop and think about those numbers for a moment and the impact should dawn upon you. 280 hours is 35 days. At an average of 21 working days per month, that means that 1 week of a team of 7 people equates to nearly 2 calendar months of your time if it were laid out linearly. Now think of the conversations that you've had recently about the "things I'm gunna do", or "I thought about doing that but..." and you start to realize what a valuable asset such a block of time amounts to. So I suggest that each week when you arrive to work to meet your team of 7 that you should think about that week in the context of what you'd like to achieve if you had 2 months of focused time to work towards achieving your goals.
To truly maximize that 2 month block of time invest a little effort in working out what that activities that you do are which don't help you get closer to meeting your goals. Is it reading email? Is it surfing the web? Or is it the greatest time killer of all... procrastination? Whatever it is, you must change your environment to assist you in maximizing what you get out of your allotment of time. I'll say it again... "CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT" to assist you in maximizing what you get out of your allotment of time.
If email is your killer habit - unsubscribe. If it's the Internet and the vast distractions of Web 2.0 - unplug. If it's procrastination - change your location.
It's your time. You have 1 shot at what you will do with it. Whatever you do with your time is what you will be remembered by.

The other day I wrote about creating a new website and mentioned that I was favoring a move to Squarespace. I've continued to think about what I want to get out of this new web home and have decided that a pure blog product won't meet my needs... I really need a Wiki to do what I want. I started looking around for a hosted Wiki offering and none really stood out. I've applied for an account with JotSpot although they are currently offline after acquisition by Google and so I now have to wait until they let me know that I can proceed. Oh well, this will give me more time to really think about what I want my Wiki to be
Or maybe the world is ready for SUW... sorry, bad joke, just kidding

One of the customs that we have in the Dev Centre at Readify is "the daily SCRUM". This involves everyone who is working on a Dev Centre project to submit an email by 10AM with their answers to those 3 well-known questions. Paul Stovell is a little different in that he tends to submit 2 SCRUM's - 1 which reflects the stuff that he does during his mild mannered daytime hours and another one which reflects the activities of his better known night-time alter ego SuperPaul. Recently while Paul was working on one particular project he started spewing out colorful charts which reflected the level of testing that his code had achieved when measured against Requirements. On those few evenings a couple of weeks ago was born "Scenario Coverage Analyser for TFS" and you can/should learn more about it by reading Paul's post on it here:

If there's one thing that I've been really crappy at over the years it is documentation - but it's definitely something that I'm getting better at! It's when I go back through all of the 1300 or so posts that I've written over these last few years that I realize what an unstructured gaggle of information I've created. Contrast the tangled web of data that I've created with other more valuable online resources such as Wikipedia and you soon get a good feel for the potential that lies behind information that is properly maintained and structured. The cool thing about Wiki's is their organic nature and how they tend to grow outwards. This gives you the ability to link articles in a manner which allows a reader to pivot around on a piece of information.
In addition to my growing admiration of wiki's I've also been giving a lot of thought to what I can do to improve the value of what I post online. This thinking has been greatly aided by the timely reading of the following two articles:
Scott Hanselman's 23 way's to keep your blog from sucking The Definitive Guide to Semantic Web Markup for Blogs
Scott Hanselman's 23 way's to keep your blog from sucking
The Definitive Guide to Semantic Web Markup for Blogs
All of this thinking has made me realize that I need a website which:
So I've decided that I'm going to start a new blog and start adding articles to it on a regular basis about a more narrow range of topics and with all of the rants removed (that's what this blog is for ). I initially thought that I might start up a Subtext blog and host it on my server but then decided not to head down that path so that I'm forced to only focus on the content management and not on the technology.
Last night I started playing around with a few of the major online blogging providers to see how they work and to get a feel for them. Here's some screen shots of what I tried out - you can actually click through to see them for yourself if you like:
Squarespace
WordPress
Blogger
Squarespace is the blog provider that Grant uses and so far it's the one that I like best. I've set it up in such a way that my name is more prominent and it will use keywords, tags, and themes that better represent the types of topics that I'll be writing about. Hopefully over time this will pay dividends in the way of better Google page rankings.
I'm going to leave all of those blogs up and running, but if you are interested in my thoughts about Knowledge Worker topics then please subscribe to my Squarespace blog.

In the past week Google has announced Google Gears, an offline data storage solution for web applications. This has been implemented by Google Reader so I can now take my blog reading offline to read offline:
In addition to adding offline reading support for Google Reader, Google have added cool new themes to their portal. Here you can see that I've added the theme called "Seasonal Scape". During the daytime the little critters can be seen at play...

Where souls leave this world
On one of my last nights in Kauai Janette took me to Polihale State Park. We went on Halloween night. A time when some believe the line between our world and the spiritual world becomes its thinnest. We decided to camp and I’ve never seen so many stars.
A cluster of stars created a rip in the sky which traveled to the other side of the sand dunes that surrounded our tent. We decided to head to the beach and see where this rift ended. At the end of the horizon a green glow beamed like portral way. According to author Agnes “Aggie” Marti-Kini His Holiness the Dalai Lama wanted to visit Polihale because it is where souls leave for the next world.
It surely seemed that way.

SOUTHERN SON
Born on the Hudson, twenty-two years gone
Bred and raised in the City
From my daddy's knee I learned the Union songs
Grandma sang lullabies in Dixie
And though the Northern winters fills my heart with joy
It's the Southern sun that shines down
On this Yankee boy
Well mama dreams of Paris nights and boatin' on the Seine
She said, we're gonna make it there too soon as Papa comes home again
She'd speak to me in broken French dressed like a painting of Lautrec
At night she'd clutch me to her breast and say, well make it outta here
And though Parisian ladies strut so fine down the Eiffel morning
It's a Southern one I sing my songs for
Well with the local bunch of do-good boys and an old man from the West
We crossed the land in the caravan we traveled with the best
W saw circus acts and vaudeville hacks and a Mississippi Delta Queen
She told me the news and sold me her blues in an alley in New Orleans
And though the Western plains are still stained
With the blood of great cowboys
It's a Southern sun that shines down on this Yankee boy

Edition Two
Hello all! And Welcome to the second edition of Yankee Yapping. I hope you all enjoyed my last rant about the Hall of Fame game, but now it’s time to do some Bronx Bomber blabbering. Away we go!
My thoughts on…
This Past Weekend
It was a bad weekend to be a Yankee fan, that’s for sure. It was disgraceful. Coming off that sweep in Minnesota, I had a good feeling about our chances in Anaheim. The Yankees were certainly carrying momentum, and it showed in the first few innings of Friday night’s game.
When the Yanks took that early 4-1 lead, I felt like they were going to win. But of course, Joba Chamberlain had to toss too many pitches and get himself taken out, not pitching past the fifth inning. Then the bullpen just couldn’t get the job done.
Saturday and Sunday were just as bad. Saturday was another game like Friday–getting a lead and squirreling it away. And Sunday we just kept trying to come back from deficit after deficit and couldn’t do it.
After this weekend, I truly know how it feels as a baseball fan to be burned by a former friend. It seemed every time Bobby Abreu was stepping into the box against us he was either hitting an RBI single or double. We just couldn’t get our former teammate out.
Abreu went 6-for-14 this weekend with six RBIs and three runs scored. I couldn’t stand it. Every time he got a hit I kept saying to myself, “we should have just re-signed him. He could be doing this for us rather than against us.”
Even the guys who aren’t hitting this season killed us. Robb Quinlan was batting .219 with no home runs and four RBIs, and yet he managed to start hitting in the series against the Yankees.
The Angels just seem to have the Yanks’ number. They eliminated us in the first round of the playoffs in 2002 and in 2005, and no matter what we do we just can’t seem to take them out.
What’s done this weekend is done. But I hope the Yanks can figure out a way to beat the Halos before October, because God help us if we’re facing the Angels in the first round. They have not been very kind to us in the past.
All Star Break
Despite the Yanks’ recent struggles against the Angels, they have played some incredible baseball to this point. They find themselves at 51-37 this year, 14 games above .500 at the half way point.
They are three games behind the Red Sox for first place in the American League Eastern Division, and the leaders by two-and-a-half games in front of Texas for the AL Wild Card.
Last year they were 50-45, only five games above .500 and six games out in the division race. As compared to last year, they are in a much better place.
If the season ended today, we would be in the playoffs, and it has to stay that way. Historically, the Yankees have great numbers after the All Star break, and usually come out of the gate swinging, so-to-speak.
CC Sabathia and Robinson Cano are two Yankees I can think of that are “second half players,” usually putting up their best work after the All Star break. I’m expecting both of these guys to continue that this year.
It’s safe to say the Yankees are doing a lot better than last year around this time, still in the hunt for a division crown and the leaders in the Wild Card. They have to make the playoffs this year, because Joe Girardi might be done as manager if they don’t.
Home Run Derby
Since it first began in 1985, the Home Run Derby has provided an enjoyable night for every baseball fan, and I am no exception.
In recent years I have kept score of who hits how many home runs in each round. It’s a little nerdy, but I am baseball fanatic, so I guess it’s normal.
The only thing I usually don’t like about the derby is the lack of pinstripes. There have only been two Yankees that have won the Home Run Derby, and ironically enough they have both been first basemen.
Tino Martinez (my favorite player during the Yankee Dynasty years) blew everyone out in 1997 at Jacobs….errm…Progressive Field in Cleveland. He put on such a great display of power and beat out the likes of Ken Griffey, Jr., Jim Thome, Mark McGwire, and Chipper Jones.
Martinez even said he was more nervous about competing in the Home Run Derby than the actual All Star Game because he didn’t feel he was really a home run hitter. He didn’t want to compete in the derby and not hit a home run, but wound up winning the contest.
Jason Giambi became the second Yankee to win the Derby in 2002 at Miller Park in Milwaukee. I remember watching it, and just being happy another Yankee won the contest. I never really liked Giambi as a player, but I’ll give him his due.
Giambi beat out his future teammate Alex Rodriguez, the current home run king* Barry Bonds, and Sammy Sosa–all of whom were amazing home run hitters at the time. And he did it wearing pinstripes.
This year Brandon Inge (Detroit Tigers), Joe Mauer (Minnesota Twins), Ryan Howard (Philadelphia Phillies), Nelson Cruz (Texas Rangers), Adrian Gonzalez (San Diego Padres), Carlos Pena (Tampa Bay Rays), Prince Fielder (Milwaukee Brewers), and Albert Pujols (St. Louis Cardinals) will all be taking their hacks for the Home Run Derby crown.
If you want my prediction, Pujols wins this easily.
He is leading the majors this year with 32 homers and 87 RBIs, and some people are going as far as saying he could win the Triple Crown. He is also playing in his home park in St. Louis, thus giving him a distinct advantage over the other participants.
Earlier this season, Pujols smashed a home run that went so far, it knocked out the “I” on the electrical McDonald’s “Big Mac” sign at Busch Stadium. He can hit and hit comfortably at his home park.
In my view, Pujols wins it by a landslide.
All Star Game
The mid-summer classic is always a fun night. The fans get to see the best-of-the-best playing on the same field at the same time.
Unfortunately I wasn’t able to attend the game last year at Yankee Stadium, but at least the American League won it.
The AL always seems to hold down the National League in this game. The last time the NL won the All Star game was 1996 (If you don’t count the 7-7 tie in 2002).
These last few years have showed the AL’s dominance over the NL, and I expect the same this year.
My prediction is the AL over the NL, 5-3.
The only thing that would make this great would be to see Derek Jeter or Mark Teixeira or Mariano Rivera win the All Star Game’s Most Valuable Player Award. The last Yankee to win it was Jeter in 2000, and it’d be nice to see a Bomber take it home to New York again.
I’d also love to see Rivera close out the contest and get the save. He has saved three All Star Games in his career (1997, 2005 and 2006) and is tied with Dennis Eckersley for most All Star Game saves.
There would be nothing more special than to see the greatest closer in baseball take first place for most All Star Game saves the same year he recorded his 500th career save.
Whichever way it goes, I have a feeling the AL will have home-field advantage in the World Series this year because of an All Star Game win.
Roy Halladay to the Yankees? Why?
As most baseball fans know, rumors have been swirling about Roy Halladay. Blue Jays’ General Manager J.P. Ricciardi put Halladay out there saying that he would be accepting offers for the ace.
ESPN’s Buster Olney reported that the Yankees, Red Sox, and Phillies are the only three teams that could possibly wind up with Halladay if he is dealt.
Olney said the Yanks and Sox have the prospects to trade for Halladay, but not the interest and the Phillies have the interest, but not the prospects.
The Yanks should generate some interest, seeing as how two of their starters could not make it out of the fifth inning this past weekend.
Joba Chamberlain is too unpredictable. He can give you seven innings with eight strikeouts, a couple walks, and maybe two runs.
Or he can give you four-and-a-third innings with no strikeouts, four walks, and five runs. He can either put us in a hole or dominate the opposition.
As good as Pettitte has been this year (8-4 is not a bad record) he often struggles at home, and in that start against the Angels this weekend, he looked bad.
Then there’s Chien-Ming Wang, who was once an ace but now an injury-ridden nobody. Alfredo Aceves took his spot in the rotation, but Girardi doesn’t want Aceves to be in the rotation. He said they will need to make a decision on what to do about that fifth spot.
In my view, the Yankees need to make a trade here. They are contenders and struggling a little bit with some pitching. Although certainly not as bad as the makeshift rotation last year, they could use one more solid pitcher.
If I were Brian Cashman, I would think about packaging some minor leaguers and maybe some back-end bullpen pitchers to Toronto for Halladay.
There are a few guys that I’d be willing to part with, namely Sergio Mitre, Kei Igawa, Edwar Ramirez, David Robertson, and Brian Bruney. If you gave up some of those guys, the Yanks would be a lot safer, and here’s how:
If they give up Mitre, it’s fine. They’re not losing anyone important to the Major League team. Igawa is the same way, and so is Ramirez. Robertson has been useless, a la walking two batters with the bases loaded in Minnesota and pitching even worse against the Angels.
Bruney could go and we could ‘pen Chamberlain again. If he is going to be as unpredictable as he is, he should go back to where he was lights out: the bullpen. We could then use Chamberlain as the eighth inning set-up man and put either Phil Hughes or Aceves into the fifth spot.
So let’s say for hypothetical the starter goes six innings. The Yanks can put Hughes/Aceves in for the seventh, Chamberlain in for the eighth, and Rivera for the ninth.
If they received Halladay in a trade, they wouldn’t have to worry about re-signing him until the end of the 2010 season when his contract expires. I think that was the reason the Yanks waited on getting Sabathia and Teixeira.
Both Sabathia and Teixeira were traded mid-season last year, and both players’ contracts were up at the end of the year.
If the Yankees had traded for both guys, they could’ve lost them to free agency after giving up their best prospects to get them. When Sabathia and Teixeira went to the Yankees, both the Brewers and Angels lost.
Milwaukee and Los Angeles lost Sabathia and Teixeira, respectively, and the players they gave up for Sabathia and Teixeira.
The Yankees wouldn’t have to worry about losing Halladay at the end of the season because he’d be locked up for at least another year before having to worry about re-signing him.
Even if you don’t have an extraordinary fifth starter, you have four guys that can carry you through a playoff series with Sabathia, A.J. Burnett, Pettitte, and if we were to get him, Halladay.
I hope they do make a decision and opt to negotiate for Halladay. But they have to make up their mind soon–the trade deadline is at the end of the month.
Well that’s all for this week’s edition of Yankee Yapping. I’ll be back next week with more analysis. Enjoy the Home Run Derby and All Star Game, everyone!

Last - held at a bowling green in Hobart it was a day filled with laughter, champagne and lots of barefoot bowling.
This couple were watching a tournament being played on the top green, murmuring about the game. I asked how long they had been together.
" About two years," she said. " Our partners both died some time ago and we were all great friends - and now we are together."
On Sunday we drove through the lush green of the Lachlan Valley. Tall poplars lined the road side as did vibrant wildflowers. The air was still and only the call of a child playing in a paddock disturbed the silence.
We had been uncertain about going to MONA. We are glad we did. Yes there is art that is confronting but there are also waterfalls of words, sculpures made of delicate foam, tiny bees and butterflies strung on spider web fine strings. A goldfish swimming in a bowl on a chair. A white room filled with white books. A giant worm in a graveyard of marble headstones which mutters and breathes as you walk past. Or stop and stare.
We will return.
Stunning images, as always. Hobart seems to be such a unique place. I would love to visit.

We stayed at the Islington Hotel many years ago...I think it has been renovated since then.
And MONA! Love it.

HIPPY is a home-based early intervention program that helps parents provide educational enrichment for their preschool children. The program stresses the vital role that parents' play in their children's early education and is designed specifically for those parents who may not feel confident enough in their own abilities to teach their children what they consider "school knowledge". The basic HIPPY program model addresses directly the first National Educational Goal that by the year 2000 all children will enter school ready to learn and, more specifically, the second objective which states that parents will have the materials and support they need to help their children at home. By supporting parents, the primary goal of the HIPPY program is to increase vulnerable children's success in school and, ultimately, in adult life.
To learn more about HIPPY, contact Barbara Scherr, Specialist, Program Planning and Special Projects. She can be reached at the Maryland State Department of Education, 200 West Baltimore Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, or by calling her at (410) 767-0291.

The short answer is that they want it to fail. There seems to be an underpinning of glee to get to deadpool it, and no one has told them it's no longer trendy to call podcasting a failure anymore.
The long answer has to do with a lot of factors. The subject is brought to my attention by Ian Lamont, who's written another weekend article that takes a hit out on podcasting as an industry due to the failings of a few. In an editorial published today, Ian talks about the black eye podcasting as a whole has recieved as a result of the failure of PodTech to sell for more than half a million.
Just as I predicted at the end of that article, the myopic analysis on the "death of podcasting" is beginning anew. Ian pontificates:
"...[M]y original thesis: Podcasting is failing as a business platform, and has failed to make a mainstream impact [...] But even if the stars had stuck around to the end, and the management and board problems were addressed earlier, I have to wonder how well this venture would have done. This was a hyped business built on one of the most hyped technologies of 2005. Once the."
When it comes down to it, though, Ian only has a few points to prop up his diagnosis of podcasting: PodTech more or less failed in the end, podcasting was overhyped and his analysis of a podcasting survey from two years ago shows that there's no growth in podcasting.
The problem is that his analysis has little basis in reality. Podcast).
Even for those wanting to start from nothing in the business, there are a number of established podcast companies that are out there. Some of them have some very impressive revenues, and some are squarely profitable. There are even a number of folks outthere doing a full-time living just with indie podcasting alone, many of which we've covere
d here at Mashable.
In case you need to review proof podcasting isn't dead:
Wizzard has a great 2007, and a superb Q1 2008. In 2007, they grossed over $5 million, and in the first quarter of 2008, they increased revenues by 130%.
Leo Laporte hauls down a chunk of change. In June, we reported that Leo Laporte landed a $100,000 contract with video streamer Stickam. Leo left us a comment to correct us - it wasn't a $100k check, as we made it sound, but a revenue sharing agreement that he had hopes would bring down much more than that (this, of course, in addition to all the other money he brings in with his podcasting mini-empire).
BlinkX Hits $60 CPM on Video. Granted it's a select segment of the market, but showing hard proof that podcasting can be big business is harder to
better exemplify elsewhere.better exemplify elsewhere.
Smartassed Ninja Makes $50,000 in Eight Months. Everyone's favorite wise-cracking ninja made a nice chunk of change before going on to make the millions with official sponsorship and millions of video views per episode.
Podcasting isn't dead, it isn't a failure, and it isn't impossible to build a business around. It isn't necessarily what we thought it was when we first started up with it. A lot of us early adopters got stars and money signs in our eyes when we first started playing with podcasting. PodTech did a lot of adapting to the realities of the business, and the VCs ultimately didn't care to make those adaptations with them, which is a big reason why it failed.
Again, though, to say that PodTech's ultimate failure is somehow an inherent failure to the concept of podcasting is about like blaming the hammer for fall of London Bridge and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

Imagine a world in which a convocation of observers made your every decision — from what you eat to what job you hold to who you date. Well, there's a cadre of people out there who are currently living in such a state, and they're not players in some lost Orwellian drama. No, they're members of a burgeoning social media trend: Crowd sourcing your life.
Over the past few months, several projects have emerged that play upon the theme of relinquishing control of one's life as a form of entertainment: From amateur productions to professionally produced web shows. Each is fascinating in its own right — an intimate glimpse into someone's life that you as a viewer can actively participate in.
Living in the public eye is nothing new when it comes to web trends. Folks like Justin Kan — of Justin.tv — have been launching projects like this for several years, and reality shows have carved out a sizable niche in the realm of TV programming.
Still, the added element of strapping on the puppet strings and turning over one's life to the masses makes this trend different from the Jennie Cams of old.
So why the proliferation of projects that tap into the ethos of the masses in order to create entertainment? "We are naturally inclined to like the idea of living someone else's life or controlling someone else's life or physically being inside of someone else's body," says Jamie Wilkinson of Know Your Meme. "That even goes back to the spookiness of ventriloquism. That theme of control and possession is a really common storytelling trope that touches on human nature."
Also, the accessibility of the necessary technology has aided in the spread of average people becoming "Internet famous." Still, novelty is always an issue when you're aiming to cut through the clutter and emerge as a legitimate addition to the viral firmament.
"Things like that are interesting only when they're unique," says Justin Kan. "It's becoming a lot easier to produce this content. For us, we had to produce [on] this 25-pound broadcasting device [to film Justin.tv]. Now we're releasing an app that will broadcast from your iPhone or Android. Now more people are able to do this. I think there's going to be a trend of more people creating video mobiley, on the go."
We've taken a look at four instances of crowd sourcing one's life — all of which launched around the same time, but include their own set of hardships and rewards. We've included glimpses into each project below, demonstrating the stresses and oddities inherent in handing over the reins to the world wide web.
1. David on Demand
David on Demand launched back in June, when David Perez put his life in the hands of his Twitter followers in order to snag the chance to attend the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in France. Perez works for the ad agency Leo Burnett, who promised to send him to the fest if he undertook said task.
The 29-year-old recruiter agreed to don a pair of glasses complete with webcam, and follow the commands of his Twitter follows via @davidondemand for a full six days, during which he posted video of the proceedings to his website.
The most challenging task? "Have you seen my tattoo? That was a trying challenge," Perez says. The recruiter got a tat of the Twitter Fail Whale at the behest of his followers. "In all seriousness though, there were more than 3.5 million Tweets coming in through @davidondemand, so it was challenging to keep up. I ended up completing about 20,000 requests. I also drank enough pink wine to kill a small horse."
Despite the permanent reminder of the whole experiment now scorched into his arm (see the video above), Perez found the experience to be less trying and more eye-opening: "The Internet –- as I affectionately call all the people following the project –- surprisingly treated me wonderfully," he says. "I went into this guided by the assumption that they would be my tormentors. Quite the opposite. They tweeted me water, a massage, naps, food and a chance to visit the seminars — which was why I was in Cannes.... I am continually floored at how the Internet personified itself. It's amazing to me that something so deceptively cold could turn itself into a very real and human thing."
Of course, the whole project was not just about personal discovery — it also served as a form of advertising for Perez's company (he completed tasks during the conference itself). The idea of hitching one's wagon to a viral trend is becoming more and more commonplace these days (see: The Old Spice Guy, etc), and Perez sees real promise in such endeavors.
"Crowd sourcing programs like David on Demand are effective for brands because they let people actually interact with brands," he says. "People are starting to demand more spontaneous, real-time relationships with brands and these types of projects do just that. I think the world also likes being 'talked to' and not 'talked at.'"
2. Dan 3.0
Dan Brown has achieved a goal that many can only dream of: He has leveraged his YouTube presence into a career. Brown first hit the video-sharing scene back in 2007 when he posted a tutorial to YouTube that showed viewers how to solve a Rubik's Cube. "That won the 2007 YouTube Award for best instructional video; I was 17 years old at the time," says Brown. "I decided to try to turn video blogging into a career after that and I guess it's worked."
This past August, Brown partnered with Internet television network Revision3 to launch a new web show called Dan 3.0, during which the 20-year-old (yup, he's only 20) plans to record a daily log of his life for one year, the path of which will be left up to the whims of his followers. Revision3 fashioned a "decision engine" for the project, which allows viewers to submit tasks for Brown to execute.
So where did this idea come from? Back in January, Brown found himself in a kind of limbo when it came to novel vlogging ideas. It was 2 a.m. and he was in his customary blogger’s uniform — half-naked in a Snuggie — when he came upon a documentary called Us Now, which detailed the state of the Internet, looked to its future, and the collaborative nature of the online space.
Struck by this concept, Brown decided to follow suit, launching a web show where he would take suggestions from viewers on how to live his life. “The more control you can give to communities, the better,” he said, explaining the prudence behind letting a gaggle of strangers run the show.
Brown didn't have that many rules in place when it came to what he was willing to do. "There are a few hard and fast rules," he says. "1). Can't change my girlfriend, 2). I'm not going to change my family, 3). They can't change where I live permanently. 4). I'm not going to break any laws, 5). I'm not going to do anything that has a significant impact on others. We decided that I have veto power, but the agreement is, obviously, if I veto something that the viewers don't think should be vetoed, I lose credibility."
"We wanted to show the viewers that I am committed to this," he says. "It's not just a fleeting thing. It's not just a cute little idea. I really am seriously excited about this and it's a project that I consider to be deeply personal."
Since the project launched this summer, Brown has hit a few bumps in the road. At one point, he disappeared for a stretch of time, which raised concern and ire among his followers (see above), and he doesn't exactly update daily. Still, he's been faithfully documenting of late and has even scored advertisers like Netflix and GoDaddy.
The videos that Brown has been creating, though rather lengthy in web terms, have been captivating. Yes, there's a hefty amount of complaining and angst in the first few videos but Brown ultimately manages to present a unique coming-of-age narrative — moving into his own place, visiting his girlfriend and muddling through the (perhaps overly ambitious) project that he has locked himself into for an entire year.
Brown doesn't hide the fact that creating a daily web show is a huge undertaking and that a less-than-polished aesthetic makes the show worth watching. It's more honest than your average reality show.
3. Dating Brian
We introduced the world to Brian Moore back in July by making fun of his pants. The 23-year-old had just launched a video announcing his intent to date 30 girls in 30 days, all chosen by Twitter and Facebook.
"Even negative press is good press. [My capris] became like a talking point for the project," Brian told me, after I apologized for the ill-fated crack once the project had wrapped. "It became one of the main talking points, and my [fellow] interns and I laughed about it constantly. There were drawings made of it in the office. Some guy drew a mood chart between sad to happy, and it would show different stages of how far up my pants would be rolled. Sad would be all the way down."
His pants weren't the only thing that went viral; the concept of a month of crowd sourced dating spread across the web post haste — which was a good thing for Moore, considering it was part of a project to be completed during his internship at ad agency BBH. The goal of the project? Make something — anything — famous. Needless to say, Moore and his cohorts succeeded.
Still, it wasn't all about fame for Moore. "I had been in a long relationship that had ended about just over a year ago now," he says. "So I was single, I had just come to New York. So I thought, why not do something crazy like that?"
"It started as a joke," he says. "I was with a couple of friends, a couple of my fellow interns, over brunch one day, and I think I actually tweeted it: 'What if I crowd sourced my dating life?' Like reality show meets Web 2.0, meets dating, meets performance art, meets me."
Although Moore — like Brown — got sidetracked a few times during the experiment (he didn't manage to make a video for every date), he was successful in the end. Still, it was taxing to go on dates, hold down his internship and create videos of every single one of his outings. "If you're going to be doing something almost reality show-like, and there are people's integrities on the line, get somebody in between you and that person," Moore recommends for would-be life bloggers.
"I did everything. I did all the video. I did all the web — the design of everything," he says. "If it's going to be something so personal like that, get someone in between that. Because I don't want to say anything bad about any of my dates or anything like that. You might need to be a bigger a**hole than me to make it more interesting, to keep the drama going — because I just don't like drama too much."
And that's the element that made this experiment so genuine: It could have been a hell of a lot bigger. Moore was even approached by VH1 and MTV, but he preferred to keep the project going on his own terms. "I wanted to keep it as real as possible," he says. "Because, sure, it's online, I'm in this internship and everything like that, but behind it all, I'm actually myself. I mean, I wasn't being anyone different than who I am. Because I know how reality shows are — I wanted to distance myself as far from that personally and the project as a whole as I possibly could."
Although Moore didn't actually find love during this endeavor, he did take a lot away from the experience. "The first question that people ask me is: What was the worst date? But there really wasn't one," he says. "I got to see all these different parts of New York that I had never seen before and meet a lot of interesting people."
Moore would even do the whole thing all over again — for someone else, that is. If you're looking to have a slew of digital matchmakers at your beck and call, hit Moore up.
4. ControlTV
If you're still hungering for some crowd sourced action, you're in luck — there's currently a professionally made web show on the scene in which a hapless 20-something has relinquished his life to you, the viewers.
The show, which launched on October 6 and will run for six weeks, follows Tristan on his quest for self-improvement... at the hands of the voting public. Tristan's life is live streamed 24/7 on the ControlTV website and then edited into 3-minute webisodes, which run on the site and across co-producer DBG’s content network of 2,600+ sites. Viewers can sign up to be informed of polls that will sway Tristan's life, and have the opportunity to vote throughout the day on his decisions.
Before the show was even cast, we chatted with executive producer Seth Green about the goal of this project. "This is not Aldous Huxley, this is not Animal Farm. This is a lighthearted premise and we are trusting the audience not to tread dark," he told us. "It's comedic, but we want to offer people the opportunity to help this guy improve his life. Find a job, find a girlfriend, figure out who he is in the world and we're looking for people to offer their opinions and help him."
So far, episodes have centered around finding a personal trainer, a girlfriend (via Skype conversations with various girls) and a profession (perhaps something in the music business). Tristan, like Dan et al., certainly has his moments of anguish, but the show mostly presents the whole thing as a positive experience. Still, it is a much slicker production — what with the blatant product placements for Snickers and Ford. (Tristan eats a Snickers after every workout, like some kind of highly caloric granola bar.)
The fact that there's actually a super polished EdTv-esque show out there only contributes to the idea that projects of this nature are gaining traction. "It's relevant in this moment in time because we as a culture have become judge, jury and executioner of our fellow man in a really interesting way," says Green. "If you look at the way pop culture has extended and the way the tabloid culture has been [taking] life, people are very interested in the public and private comings and goings of any celebrities and they take on a collective point of view... There's an interest in making someone do what you want and holding them accountable for what the public feels are the moral standards. So this kind of concept is really relevant in my opinion — in that sense, people are very interested in having some control over another person. Having their opinion be rewarded. Having their perspective and their insight being the law, in a way."
"We're just really excited to see what happens," he says. "This is one of those moments where you stand on the precipice and you hope for the best, but we really just don't know. And that's kind of what's so exciting about it. We have no idea how the audience is going to react to this guy. We have no idea how much they're actively going to take an interest in making his life better. And we have no idea — within reason, because we'll have some degree of control of how much this guy is tortured or not — we just don't know what he's going to take away from this experience and neither does the guy. And that to me is really exciting."

Removing Red Links: See below
Supporting links or images:
Other NotesEdit
So I'm sick of seeing red links. There's no reason to have them because they are removed on sight anyway in main space articles, but there are a bunch sitting around that no one can get to because of current restrictions. As it stands, all users are prohibited from editing the user pages and talk page comments of other users for any reason except to revert obvious vandalism edits, making it impossible for many red links to be removed. This proposal is meant to change that. I believe that it's reasonable to give administrators, who already have a wide range of powers and the implicit trust of the community to use them, the power to remove any red link anywhere. I realize that this is an invasive power for admins to have, but someone has to be able to do it and I don't see any other solution to the red link issue. Hence this proposal; nothing ventured, nothing gained. -- Commdor (Talk) 03:11, August 9, 2010 (UTC)

Change the 'registered users who've commented within 30 days must be notified and given 7 days to comply' to 'all users must be notified and given 7 days to comply' and you'll have my vote. SpartHawg948 03:20, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
- Done. -- Commdor (Talk) 03:33, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
- Rog-o! SpartHawg948 03:33, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
- Maybe this will prevent needless articles from being created over and over, and then we have to deal with deleting it. Lancer1289 04:35, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
I'll support this if instead of deleting the link the admins simply adds the <nowiki></nowiki> tags. It leaves the comments as they were originally written but without any obnoxious red links. Bastian964 05:10, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
- But the current proposal would leave the comments the way they were originally written. All we'd be doing is removing the brackets, so basically turning (for example) Omega to Omega. I would have to oppose a proposal to do it with tags, as I hate using those tags. Just removing a set of [[]], on the other hand, is A-OK in my book. SpartHawg948 05:19, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
- Indeed why add the nowiki tags when removing the brackets is much easier, faster, and instead of adding code, removes it. Lancer1289 05:23, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
- (edit conflict)I guess we differ slightly on a semantic issue. I would like them how they were originally written with <nowiki></nowiki> added, whereas you want the comments to look how they originally did but without the links. I'm not horribly against your method, I just think my suggestion is more in keeping with the spirit of the current policies. Bastian964 05:27, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
- But again, the way Lancer and I (the people who would actually be doing this) are proposing would, as you say, keep the comments looking like they do originally. How is that not in keeping with the spirit of the current policies? SpartHawg948 05:30, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
- Like I said we differ slightly on semantics. If that is the way people want that is fine with me, I'll just remain neutral. Also please note I said "more in keeping" indicating your way was in keeping with the original policy, just that I didn't think it followed the spirit as well as my option. Bastian964 05:37, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
- I dunno. I think the option more in keeping with the spirit of the current policies is the one that keeps the comment looking as nearly identical to the original as possible, which would seem to be the one that only changes the color of the text from red to white. SpartHawg948 05:39, August 9, 2010 (UTC)
And the voting period has concluded. The final vote is four in favor, one neutral, and zero against. The proposal passes. -- Commdor (Talk) 00:41, August 17, 2010 (UTC)

Let?
I'm not talking here about characters with a mental illness. Depression is technically a mental illness. (All right, it's a mental disorder, but you get the idea.) You feel sad with no actual reason; you don't say up at night painting the walls with honey so that the bees can hear you and sing your songs of praise to the bee-mother.
The relevant point is that this is big, dramatic madness, not the sort of thing that you add to a character after you've taken an Introduction to Psychology class. We're talking about characters who don't perceive reality in the same way as everyone else, characters whose fundamental ability to deal with the world is broken. They're not quirky, they're not funny, and they sure as heck aren't there to dance for the amusement of anyone else. These are characters that give you a skin-crawling sensation and a sense that something is very, very wrong here.
In other words, this is about cinematic insanity, not the ever-growing and important field of mental health. (If you have to be told not to use this stuff as a key to understanding real mental issues, I'm very disappointed.) Your character's mental disorders aren't under discussion, just the fact that he or she is now several cards short of a full deck.
Why do I want to use it?
For starters, madness provides an important function by giving other players a problem that they cannot punch out of. This is kind of a big deal because most MMOs take place in a setting where problems can be dealt with via weaponry, and player characters carry obscene amounts of weaponry. Giving players a problem that doesn't go away with a few determined rounds of combat is a major asset, and "the one person who knows something important is completely crazy" is certainly such a problem.
But there's also the very simple fact that William Shakespeare understood: Madness is dramatic. Mad characters lead allies on wild goose chases, cause harm to others more or less at random, and start rumors inadvertently. Plus, sometimes the maniac turns out to be completely right in the end, which is even more of a mind screw. A character with altered perceptions of the world makes for a lot of interesting conflict, provided that the character is used for conflict and not just wacky antics.
I'm glad you asked, section header. Madness for dramatic purposes tends to have one of four sources mostly because the fact that "aberrant brain chemistry controllable via pharmaceuticals" is a really boring conclusion.
He hurts too much: There's a certain amount of loss that the human brain can cope with, but too much damage throws it into tumult. Get hit with enough trauma at high enough speed, and a mind might just shatter from the impact. Characters like this have been dealt a horrendous blow, either through tragedy or malicious torture, and as a result, they've broken off ties with reality altogether.
In most fiction, this is the sort of blow dealt to a character seen as being particularly solid, a sound mind in a sound body. Expect to have a character talking to dead friends, lost relatives, or even going from a titan of a man into a sniveling wreck within moments. It's not pleasant.
He knows something he shouldn't: Also known as Lovecraft Syndrome, this is when your character picked up more knowledge than he could handle. Maybe he learned some horrifying fundamental truths about the universe, maybe he found out his real father is someone awful, or maybe he just isn't prepared to deal with the truth of point nine repeating. The point is that he's become a babbling shell as a result.
Usually, this works best in a setting that allows for sanity-blasting revelations, but you can also do just as well in more benign settings by overfilling a character's head. Imagine if your character in Guild Wars 2 managed to absorb the entirety of all human knowledge over the past 200 years at once. He's going to go crazy because the human brain simply can't process that much information.
There's an external force: This reason is blessedly simple. Aaron has gone crazy because Ben used the Crazy Macguffin to make him crazy. Stop Ben, and Aaron goes back to normal. Or doesn't.
Technically, trauma counts as an external force, but here we're talking about a much more push-button madness. Some external set of circumstances is basically entirely behind everything, and removing those external circumstances either negates the condition or makes it curable.
He's just like that: In some cases, there's no reason to be found. The character is just plain mad. He might not have always been like that, but at this point, trying to untangle the path back to a reasonable human being is a fruitless endeavor. He's out of his mind, and the best you can do is cope with all the crazy.
Mad but north-northwest

Who we are
MathTeamHosting is a web hosting and application development service taylored to the unique needs of math leagues. Considerable secretarial and data-entry work goes on behind the scenes to make a math league run. Our developer will work with your league to reduce that work and get score reports to schools more quickly. To discuss a web based data solution for your league, contact LaSpina@mathteamhosting.com
Why does a math league need a web site?
- Organizations are expected to have some on-line presence. The question has shifted from "What do we need a web site for?" to "Why don't we have a web site yet?"
- Students and teachers want to see results. After a contest, most students naturally ask "How did I do?"How long does it take to see how students and teams scored relative to each other? With MathTeamHosting, the answer is about 3 days, because that's how long it takes most coaches to send in their scores.
- Statistics on item difficulty are easy to generate when the scores are in a database. Contest authors, students, and teachers all benefit from this information.
- Students and coaches will appreciate having an archive of past contests to use.
What will it look likeThe result tables will look similar to the Mandelbrot competition with a few differences:
- On the results table, the coaches will be able to sort students by name, graduation year, school, or score.
- Coaches can download results as an excel (CSV) file
- Statistics are generated for each contest. View the Nassau County Interscholastic Math League stats.Here what you see is just plain text, but a nice histogram can also be created. Next year's version will look even better.
Would you like your site to look like The Math League? We think their data entry form is poorly designed and time consuming to use, but if you want a bad design we will make it for you (after we try to talk you out of it)!
Would you like a site like The continental math league? No problem. MathTeamHosting is a hosting and application development company, so everything will be customized to meet your needs. You decide what you want and we build it. We take care of hosting the site, whcih means setting up usernames and passwords and deciding what parts to restrict access to.
How does on-line score reporting work?
Each school in the league will be given a username and password. Coaches log-in to register students and teams before the first meet. They can type the names into a web form or upload a list from a spreadsheet. Once the names are in the database, scores can be entered in a matter of minutes. The Nassau County league appreciated having an eMail reminder sent a few days after a contest was given. After all, the system can only report results if the teams send them in. A number of leagues have had problems with this and an on-line system can help.

Deploying and running Django apps on Heroku is really a no-brainer, except for one thing — serving static files via
collectstatic.
I run
collectstatic as usual, using
heroku run command just like how I did it for
syncdb. It worked but I’m getting 404 error when serving static files.
It turns out that running
collectstatic via
heroku run spins up a new dyno and
collectstatic is running in an isolated environment. So, all the collected static files are deployed to that location and only for this new dyno and the dyno attached to our Django app can’t access that. — Heroku support staff
Solution
The dead simple solution would be to run
collectstatic as part of the Procfile before starting the app. We need to “chain” together our Procfile commands for the web process, like so:
OK there you go, no more 404 error when serving static files from your Django app on Heroku. Plus, every time you deploy your app, newly added static files will be collected automatically.
Update
There are a lot of questions about the configurations. Cross check with my settings.py here
Important thing here is your STATICFILES_DIRS. Make sure to include your project_name/app_name/static here. In my case, I have project_name/staticfiles for the STATIC_ROOT. Change STATIC_URL = ‘/static/’ if you want to serve from Heroku, same goes to ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = ‘/static/admin/’
Finally add this to your urls.py in order to serve from Heroku.
urlpatterns += patterns(”,
(r’^static/(?P.*)$’, ‘django.views.static.serve’, {‘document_root’: settings.STATIC_ROOT}),
)
Files could be access as such:
/app/project_name/staticfiles/style.css >.

I’ve just been looking into Heroku for hosting myself… I had read that the Cedar filesystem was ephemeral, i.e. wiped whenever the dyno is restarted. I thought that would preclude serving Django’s static files.
But do your commands above automatically run collectstatic when the new dyno is spun up, to reinstate them?
So it would just be user-uploaded files I’d need to run from S3 instead?
Sorry for the late, late reply.
It will run every time you do git push heroku master.
FYI, I’m using django storages & django compressor to serve static files via Amazon S3. In order for compressor to work, you’ll need a temp file system cache on Heroku, thus the solution above.
Hi there, am running into the same problem.
I wonder how you’ve setup your STATIC_URL, STATIC_ROOT and STATICFILES_DIR as I’m almost hitting my head on the wall now
Post has been updated. Check the settings.py
I have a question. I tried your snippet to get static but for me it doesn’t work.
What do you have in settings file? What is STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT?
With regards
Kamil
I’ve included a sample of my settings.py. Cross check with yours
Thanks
It’s working now. Founded solution.
So I have:
In Debug:
STATIC_ROOT = ‘static/’
STATIC_URL = ‘/static/’
and in urls.py
urlpatterns = patterns(”,
…####
#### urls urls urls…
)
+ static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
And it’s working great
Bingo!
Even with Kamil’s writeup, I’m not sure what you’re proposing here. Sure, running collectstatic gets all the files in one place.
But have you configured gunicorn to serve that directory separate from the Django staticfiles app?
(If you’re willing to run the staticfiles app with DEBUG on, there’s not even a need to collectstatic; it seems to serve things fine from wherever they are. But that’s “probably insecure”, says the Django docs. So I’m trying to figure out if what you Kamil is describing somehow gets heroku-nginx or gunicorn to serve the collectedstatic directory…)
With more research I’m guessing you’ve each settled on some variant like this in urls.py:
if not settings.DEBUG:
# screw the vague FUD and django doctrine against non-DEBUG static-serving
urlpatterns += patterns(”,
(r’^static/(?P.*)$’, ‘django.views.static.serve’, {‘document_root’ :settings.STATIC_ROOT}),
)
The comments for ‘django.views.static.serve’ include more of the usual admonitions about how one ‘SHOULD NOT’ do this in a ‘production setting’. But these similarly-worded-but-never-explained warnings have echoed across Django comments/docs so much they’re beginning to look like superstitions to me rather than actual best practices.
Yup. Check my updated post.
Thanks for this post! It was very helpful in getting django static files on heroku running.
However, I’ve noticed that every time I deploy a change, even without adding any new static files, collectstatic has to run every time and causes the app restart to be longer. This is sort of annoying because any users on the site would experience a long response if they made a request while this process was happening. Do you have any advice for this problem?
This is because the collectstatic command is part of the Procfile. Quick solution will be creating two versions of Procfile, one with the collectstatic command.
I can’t think of other cleaner solution.
Nice post but I have a problem. I can’t get this done. I’m getting:
unknown specifier: ?P.
My urls.py looks like:
admin.autodiscover()
urlpatterns = patterns(”,
…
…
)
if not settings.DEBUG:
urlpatterns += patterns”,
(r’^static/(?P.*)$’, ‘django.views.static.serve’, {‘document_root’: settings.STATIC_ROOT}),
)
Ok I did it. But still, heroku can’t find my static files
Make sure your STATIC_ROOT & STATICFILES_DIR are pointing to the right place.

I replace ’^static/(?P.*)$’ for just ’^static/(.*)$’ and now is working.

Thanks for the post!! Question– how would I handle serving just a handful of static files on Heroku, and the majority via my main backend on Amazon S3? There are just a few files that I need on Heroku (to be on the same domain name… it’s related to browser compatibility issues), but I still want the rest of my files to be served via S3.
Any suggestions on how to go about this?
Hey Janelle,
I think that is possible. Just don’t use the {{ STATIC_URL }} template tag on the files that you want to serve from Heroku because it points to S3. Instead, use the absolute URL for these files.
For example: /app/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/css/login.css >
I wrote a bit about how to do this here:
So what’s stopping you from committing the changed static files after running a collectstatic locally? Seems to work for me so far.
In my settings.py I have:
PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__)
Then I use that in settings.py and urls.py to set the static directory… (Rather than a path starting in / as the manual insists on using…)
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, ‘static’)
for example…
Also, the procfile didn’t work. I got it working with:
web: python manage.py collectstatic –noinput; gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT -w 4 [project name].wsgi:application
[project name] is the folder containing wsgi.py
The following was enough if I committed the static files:
web: gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT -w 4 [project name].wsgi:application

Thanks,
I wonder how you would handle static files versions, the best I could have come up with is –
Sorry but after updating your urls.py to serve the static files doesn’t that mean that every static file requested will have to be served by both the Dyno and the Django app instead of just the Dyno.
This will push extra load on your app and that is the reason why it is marked as not good for production in the docs.

Profiteroles are one of the most popular desserts at Cafe du Soleil, especially during the hot summer months. They have the elements of any great ice cream dish – ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. The French add a nice crisp “pate a choux” (which literally translates to “cabbage pastry” , based on the shape of the cooked product). It’s an easy dough to make at home once you get the hang of it. There really are few pitfalls so please try it with confidence. Even though the recipe may look complicated – it’s not. At Cafe du Soleil we serve them with two sauces – white and dark chocolate, but you can just as easily serve it with one.
After seeing the beautiful photo above done by Philippe Touitou I dare you not to try this recipe!!
Profiteroles aux Deux Chocolats
Serves 6 – Pastry recipe makes about 12 large “Choux Puffs” so you will have an extra 6 for another round of profiteroles, or fill with whipped cream and dust with powdered sugar for cream puffs! They freeze well but you should “recrisp” them in oven after defrosting.
Pastry:
1/2 cup water
2 ozs butter, unsalted
pinch salt
1/2 cup (about 2 1/2 ozs) all purpose flour
2 large eggs
Profiteroles:
6 large scoops of your favorite vanilla ice cream
2 cups whipped cream
strawberries, powdered sugar, and mint for garnish
Chocolate Sauces:
Dark:
4 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped (better quality chocolate = better sauce)
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup light corn syrup
White:
4 ounces white chocolate
1/2 cup heavy cream
Method:
Choux pastry:
Preheat the oven to 450°F.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. spatula or wooden spoon until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and the bottom of the pan is clean, with no dough sticking to it.
Enough moisture must evaporate from the dough to allow it to absorb more fat when the eggs are added. Continue to stir for about 2-3 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary to prevent the dough from coloring. A thin coating will form on the bottom and sides of the pan. When enough moisture has evaporated, steam will rise from the dough and there will be the nutty aroma of cooked flour.
Transfer the dough to the mixer bowl and mix for a minute to release some of the heat from the dough. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, one at a time, beating until each egg is completely incorporated before adding the next one; scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.
Place the dough in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe 12 disks about 2 1/2 inches across and about 1/2 inch thick on the baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch between them, as they will expand when baked. You may need an additional baking sheet in order not to crowd them too much. Sauces:
Technique is the same for both sauces (minus the corn syrup in the white chocolate sauce) -
Place the chocolate in a metal bowl.
Combine the cream and corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Pour the liquid over the chocolate and allow it to sit for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the chocolate has melted. Whisk to combine. Allow the sauce to cool slightly, then pour into a bowl or other container.
To serve:
Preheat the oven to 300°F.
Warm the chocolate sauces in a double boiler or a microwave. Split each profiterole in half, and warm on a baking sheet in the oven until crisp.
Place bottom half of each puff on serving plate. Place a large scoop of ice cream in the bottom half of each profiterole and top with the lid. Spoon the sauces over and decorate each plate with a generous amount of whipped cream, a few strawberries, powdered sugar, and mint.
Now tell me what could be bad about that?!!!

Worldcon 2012: FragmentsSeptember 12, 2012 at 5:17 am | Posted in Essays | 10 Comments
Tags: Worldcon
Last week, I flew to Chicago for the 70th World Science Fiction Convention. It was my first Worldcon. Among other things, I was looking forward with the chance to talk to other people who read science fiction.
It’s Wednesday evening and my roommate, a veteran of more than ten previous Worldcons, is unpacking the books he hopes to get signed. He has brought 10 Robert Silverberg books. I break the bad news about the signing policy (only 3 books per trip through the line) and then, with some embarrassment, I admit I haven’t read any Silverberg. He suggests a novel that would be a good place to start, then asks what I’ve been reading lately. I tell him I read and enjoyed Kameron Hurley’s God’s War on the flight to Chicago. He’s never heard of it.
A week and a half later I am writing the first draft of this post and trying to figure out what novel he recommended, but I didn’t write it down. I have Silverberg’s Wikipedia article open in another tab. My monitor is not even close to large enough to display the published novel list on one screen. Reading Silverberg’s backlist would probably take me multiple years. Just reading the ten books my roommate wanted signed would put a substantial dent in a year’s reading schedule.
According to a post by Gary K. Wolfe, in 2008 alone Locus recorded the publication of 254 science fiction novels and 436 fantasy novels. The rise of electronic publishing and the erosion of barriers to self-publishing seem sure to increase these numbers by an order of magnitude or more soon if they haven’t already.
For the most part this is a good thing. As the genre fragments, readers can find novels aligned to their specific tastes, novels that wouldn’t be viable if less SF was published. Although more bad novels are published, more great novels are published as well. None of this is in any way unique to SF, or even literature. The same process is much further along in music and not as far along in movies and television, but entertainment of all kinds is moving in the same direction, or rather, is moving in all directions simultaneously.
Yet if you like talking about genre fiction as much as reading it, shared context is harder and harder to find. As Wolfe puts it elsewhere in the same post: “To claim a title as the best SF or fantasy novel of the year seems to me to imply a core readership with a common set of values and assumptions, but as far as I can tell that readership has been dismembering itself into various caucuses for several decades now.”
It is Wednesday afternoon, the day before the convention starts, and I have just registered and am putting mental breadcrumbs between important locations in the labyrinthine hotel. As I walk the hall, I hear the words “fen” and “mundanes” used unironically for the first time in my life. The big nametags make it easy to identify other people here for the convention, but in most cases it isn’t necessary. Convention people dress differently, talk differently, and act differently from ordinary guests. I’m amazed that people from all over the country, and indeed in some cases all over the world, seem much more like each other than they are like the people I see every day in my normal life.
From the outside, Chicago’s Cloud Gate presents a coherent (if in places distorted) skyline.
Over the next few days I will revise this first impression. Certainly the sample was skewed by the day of the week, as for a variety of reasons the people I saw on Wednesday afternoon crowd were older and much more “fannish” than the actual convention average. But also I soon realize fan culture isn’t as monolithic as it seemed at first, something I should have realized just from reading the program. How many people at the convention were interested in filk? In costuming? In table gaming? In anime? These and many more hobbies could be pursued to the exclusion of anything else if the attendee desired. Alternatively, one could (and I did, I’m afraid) ignore them entirely.
Beneath Cloud Gate the image splits into diverse but overlapping fragments.
In the convention’s pocket program, the convention chair’s welcome message included the following reassurance: “I promise you, there are several folks you haven’t met yet who are *exactly* the kind of geek you are.”
In this day and age there’s no need to settle for being friends with someone who is almost the same kind of geek you are. It’s not just entertainment that’s fragmenting, it’s culture.
On Sunday morning, I am listening to a panel titled “Historical Reality in Fantasy”. Two of the panelists turn out to have run pen and paper roleplaying games. When they spend a few minutes discussing fantasy roleplaying game settings and answer a question about them from the audience, another audience member raises his hand and objects that while he enjoys roleplaying games, he comes to Worldcon to hear about literature.
I sympathize, but he is one person out of an audience of a hundred or more. Should his concept of the panel prevail over that of the person sitting next to him? By the relentlessly democratic logic of Worldcon his opinion is, by itself, without import. Had he asked for a show of hands, the panel might have paid attention.
It’s Sunday evening and I am sitting in a room with several thousand people waiting to hear the results of the genre’s most prominent show of hands, the Hugo Awards. The Hugo Awards ceremony is the only event without anything programmed against it (on Thursday I went to a panel instead of the opening ceremonies), yet the entire convention population isn’t there. Not even close.
Still, it’s a large group, and toastmaster John Scalzi uses this to make an appeal to unity. The Hugos, he says, bring everyone together. He then builds a description of the breadth of the genre community out of allusions to the nominees. It’s a clever and well-delivered little speech, but do the Hugo Awards really bring everyone together? Is that even possible?
It’s earlier on Sunday evening and I am in the same big room with almost the same number of people twenty minutes before the Hugo awards ceremony will begin. I am saving the seat beside me for my sister, but on the other side of me are two middle-aged men. When I notice they are talking about Ken Liu’s short story “Paper Menagerie” I begin eavesdropping on their conversation. They seem like old friends, and after they both agree Liu’s story was their favorite, they go on to discuss this year’s Hugo-nominated novels. Deadline is faintly praised, Among Others is agreed to be fantastic, but then it turns out one of them hasn’t read a single China Mieville novel even though Embassytown is another of the ballot’s novel nominees.
It is the Friday after the convention and I am back home plowing through an enormous Google Reader backlog. I get to popular British blogger Adam Whitehead’s short post about the Hugo awards. After listing the winners of some of the categories, he takes a backhanded swipe at the fact 2,000 people voted, a number he seems to feel is too small to justify the awards’ reputation as the most prestigious in the genre.
In fact, not everyone votes in all categories. Only 1664 votes were cast for Best Novel, for example. We can’t know how many of those votes were cast by people who, like the man sitting next to me at the awards ceremony, have only read some of the nominees, but it seems safe to assume it was a significant percentage. The numbers are even smaller when one considers ballots cast for nominating works to the short list: only 958 in the novel category. The novel nominated the most times, Jo Walton’s eventual winner Among Others led the field with 175 votes while Hannu Rajaniemi’s debut novel The Quantum Thief received 70 nominations and missed the short list by a single vote.
So Whitehead actually overstated the size of the voting population, but that’s not to say he’s right that the small scale of the voting, and the small breadth of the voters’ reading, should decrease the awards’ prestige.
It is Sunday evening again and the Hugo ceremony is nearly over. Jo Walton is accepting the award for Best Novel. Afterward the talk about her speech will center on her thanks to disgraced Readercon volunteer Rene Walling for suggesting “Among Others” as the title for her novel, but her first words at the microphone are an apology to George R. R. Martin, as if she has received the award through some irreversible clerical error and not the will of the voters. People laugh as if this is a joke, but she may not have been joking.
If the Hugo voting population was greatly expanded in the way Whitehead implies would provide greater legitimacy, it seems safe to say A Dance with Dragons would have won. In sales of actual books, the most democratic measure of a book’s worth, there would be no contest. Longtime genre award watcher Nicholas Whyte noted in April that even among users of the site Goodreads, a group surely biased toward reading more widely than the general population, four times as many people owned A Dance with Dragons than the other four nominees combined.
The only possible solution to this tangle is to be content to have multiple awards for the best genre novel of the year, each determined by different means. Prestige can then accrue organically. Happily this is already the case. One could argue that the Nebula Awards, given to authors by other authors in a manner similar to the Oscars, ought to in fact be the most prestigious awards, but strange choices and an even more problematic voter pool make them a distant second to the Hugos.
As a side note, as easy as it is to point to a few books and call them bestsellers, it is preposterously difficult to determine what the bestselling genre books of a given year actually are, and someone with access to those numbers could do the field a service by providing the answer. Unfortunately Amazon treats sales numbers the way dragons traditionally treat treasure, so this may be impossible.
It is Thursday evening and I am in the hotel bar surrounded by people with access to at least some sales numbers. My sister, a fantasy author whose first novel was published last year, arrived in the afternoon and has been introducing me to her friends, almost all of whom are authors here primarily to promote their writing and network with other people in the industry. There are exceptions in any group but for the most part they rarely attended conventions before they were published, have few of the cultural tics of longtime fans, and when pressed most admit that since they began writing they hardly have time to read.
One might think that being an author at a literature-oriented convention would be glamorous. Perhaps it is for superstars, but I don’t meet the superstars. Most people I meet are authors who have published their first novel in the last three years or so. These are the 99% of authors, the ones for whom the exposure of sitting on a panel, even if it’s a panel about writing attended almost exclusively by authors and people aspiring to be authors, might make a noticeable difference in sales. Although the names often strike me as familiar, in almost every case I haven’t read anything they have written.
Introductions work differently in this networking-oriented population. People don’t merely say the person’s name, they add something to indicate why people should care about them. Typically it goes “X, author of Y” but there is a “spouse of” present in addition to me, a “brother of”. After an hour of this, I use the fact I have published all of four reviews with Strange Horizons to promote myself to “Matt, reviewer for Strange Horizons“. My sister deservedly laughs at me for being status conscious, but I think I detect a change. Not in the willingness of people to talk to me, for everyone is surprisingly friendly and easy-going, but in their comfort level at the initial introduction. An author’s brother could be anyone: a writer, an agent, an editor, or…just a brother. A reviewer is known quantity.
Later, I am introduced to SF Signal’s John De Nardo. I don’t really know him, but I feel like I do, for his links to SF Signal content made up 90% of my Google+ feed even when I still checked it regularly. Unlike everyone else I’ve met so far, he at least pretends my name sounds familiar. Perhaps it does: I commented on one or two of those Google+ items, and while I’m not sure I think he might have linked to my blog once or twice. But even at Worldcon this blog is obscure enough that I expect to meet no one who reads it.
It’s Friday night, and I’m waiting for an elevator with Strange Horizons editor Niall Harrison. While vacationing in the USA he has been rereading Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy and tells me that he was reading my review of it on my blog. He very much disagrees with it, he adds, in the friendly manner of someone hoping for a stimulating discussion.
I blink. I reviewed the Mars trilogy? I know I read it in the late 90s, and thankfully for all of us I wasn’t reviewing books online at the time, but all I recall is that I enjoyed some of the political machinations but found the prose drier than I would have liked. Ever courageous of my convictions, I mutter that I’ve been posting reviews online since 2003, that I’ve become a lot more sophisticated as both a reader and as a reviewer since then, and in general I throw my past self and his opinions directly under the bus.
On Saturday morning I am using Google to locate the review Niall mentioned, half-expecting he had me confused with someone else. It turns out I did review the Mars trilogy in 2006. Reading the review in 2012, the language is recognizably my own but much of the content is new to me, in particular the half-hearted discussion of the role of executives in the story. I think I was trying to say that no matter what one thinks of executives, accurately presented most of their activities make for dull reading, but I can’t say for sure. The review reads like something dashed off in thirty minutes and posted without being read over, which was generally my practice at the time.
In one sense, I “know” Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy. When it comes up in conversation I have things to say: I have read it, I can describe features of its narrative and style, I can name elements that some people find attractive and elements that some people find alienating. But it is a shallow knowledge, the sort of knowledge people write guides for faking at dinner parties. The details are lost to me until I reread it.
In cognitive science there is a concept of a working set, the amount of information we can hold in short-term memory at once for use in solving problems. How many novels can I recall enough about to discuss in depth? Not very many. It was to avoid the loss of this information that I began to write reviews. By writing down what I think, I can have access to those thoughts in the future! The brief, incomplete nature of this site’s older posts derives partly from their intended use merely as notes to stimulate recall. But whenever I revisit my reviews from before the last couple years, I run into the problem that I am no longer the same person. Six years ago I was someone else, a person who remembered different books than I do today. It’s not easy for us to have a conversation.
It’s Friday night and I am at the Night Shade party having the most free-flowing conversation I will have at the convention. I am talking with reviewer and anthologist Rich Horton, and I can cite stories and novels by name and continue to make my point without worrying he might not have read them. Eventually while discussing K.J. Parker I bring up historical fiction author Dorothy Dunnett. Even this succeeds, for like many genre readers he’s also a Dunnett fan, and we talk about her Lymond and Niccolo series. It’s only when we move still further from the genre that we run aground on the contextual rocks: I haven’t read Raymond Carver and he hasn’t read Faulkner.
It is Monday and I am flying home. I am thinking of the conversation with Horton, and how while I was able to toss out the names of short stories and be perfectly confident he would know what I’m talking about, he was not in the same position. Me talking to Rich Horton about short stories is like the friend at work who talks to me about science fiction having only read Ender’s Game and Dune.
This line of thinking develops into the beginnings of an idea for an unusual sort of convention wrap-up post, a present tense narrative that jumps around in time while following thematic threads. I have a hazy idea this is a standard form for feature articles in magazines, but I don’t read enough conventional magazines to have a good feel for the way such stories are written. I know that if I write it, I will end up aping the Doctor Manhattan issue of Watchmen more than respectable journalism. I decide that while this resort to genre is slightly embarrassing, it’s also more than a little appropriate. Doctor Manhattan’s narrative is intended to underscore his inhumanity by illustrating his nonlinear experience of time, but this is not as foreign from the human experience as we tend to think.
First person novels typically present us with a linear narrative, but this is a conceit that is nothing like how the human memory functions. Not only can I not reproduce the exact words of a conversation I had last week (the way first person narrators often authoritatively provide exact words for conversations taking place years in their past), I have trouble even remembering when in the sequence of half-remembered events a conversation happened. In writing this post I frequently had to resort to the convention program just to determine the day on which something happened. The experience was linear, but the memories that endure are only fragments.
It is Monday morning, the last day of Worldcon, and I am packing. “How was your con?” my roommate asks me. His phrasing is considered. We have been at the same convention, yet my con is not the same as his con. In five days of programming I ran into him outside our room exactly three times: twice at the only two panels we both happened to attend and once in the aftermath of the Hugo awards. In almost all respects, we have been at two different conventions superimposed on one location: different panels, different readings, different conversations, different parties. And there are far more than just two: each attendee experiences a different convention. But how could it be otherwise? Each attendee has been reading a different genre, though they are all called science fiction.

While there’s plenty to unpack out of that post I just wanted to say that that was an astonishing piece of writing. Thank you.
Comment by Ian Mond— September 12, 2012 #
Thanks for the thoughtfull post about your worldcon expierence. I’m very aware that, even at much smaller conventions, the convention I attend is very different then the same con a writer or fan attends. Your emphasis on the splintering of the genre/culture is an important point that I grapple with daily, both as a publisher, and as someone who feels deeply engaged in the genre’s “long conversation.”
It was nice meeting you, if only briefly. Hopefully you will find your way to other conventions, and be able to provide compairsons and contrasts to world con. Id love to read your impression on world fantasy, and/or readercon, or wiscon… all of which are radically different than worldcon and each other.

Thank you, Matt.
I particularly like the photos of Cloud Gate, too. I’ve been curious about it ever since SOURCE CODE.
Comment by Paul Weimer (@PrinceJvstin)— September 12, 2012 #
Wonderful post. I feel cons have always existed in a kind of fragmented continuum (how’s that for an oxymoron) in which the gamers might never meet the costumers who might never meet the filkers, and yet somehow it all weaves together to make up conspace. There’s just enough crossover from subgroup to subgroup and just enough commonality of sources to make it one fabric and not just a patchwork quilt.
Comment by ctanwriter— September 12, 2012 #
Wow, what a fantastic read. I’m three-quarters of the way through, and it occurs to me, “This is reading just like the Doctor Manhattan issue,” (I just read WATCHMEN for the first time last month) “I should write a comment about that.” Then I read the next section and laughed.
And only as I type this do I notice it fitting right in with your theme of commonality…
Comment by Chris ("Salt-Man Z")— September 12, 2012 #
As everyone else has said, this is a fascinating account: thank you for writing it. (It reminds me of some things I wrote about my first cons, particularly the point about having a role, being a known quantity.) And so far as the Mars trilogy goes, I think your write up is still worthwhile, or I wouldn’t have mentioned it! You put your finger on some things about the trilogy that are worth discussing — not just the executives and transnats (which I’d argue don’t feel so outdated now, post financial crisis), but the strong sense of national types (which is disconcerting, but which I’d argue is there so that there is something obvious to break down and leave behind as the characters become more natively Martian). So there.
Comment by Niall— September 12, 2012 #
Paul: I went to Cloud Gate expecting to be aloof and unimpressed. After all, it’s just a big mirror. But it is really is cool, and in a way that pictures (though I did take a lot; put two more on Twitter) can’t really capture. I haven’t seen Source Code yet but I’ve been meaning to check it out.
Jeremy: I may go to Capclave next month since it’s so close to where I live and that certainly would be quite a contrast. However, close though it is, I don’t think I know anyone else going, and I’m the sort of person who needs introductions to meet people.
Niall: “It reminds me of some things I wrote about my first cons”
Links?
Niall ctd: “You put your finger on some things about the trilogy that are worth discussing.”
I just wish I’d done more to discuss them then, since I can’t today. Well, can’t do so with any accuracy. I won’t let that stop me, though!
About the executives, I guess what I would say now is that if you are writing a novel about how humans on Mars evolve toward new and hopefully superior forms than what exists on benighted old Earth, you should put forward and defend a thesis about what those problems on Earth were and why they are no longer controlling on Mars. I don’t remember to what degree KSR did this, but at the time I thought the villains caricatures.
The national stereotypes are also caricatures, and in both cases I don’t think they are necessary. This isn’t a short story, it’s a trilogy, quite a long trilogy even by modern standards, I believe. Surely there’s time to give the bad guys and the bit characters–and therefore the problems they represent–some depth?
I guess the answer, to be blunt, is probably no, not when there are massive descriptions of sand taking up so much space. But while I would have liked the books a lot more without so much scenery, I’m sure many people who loved the books wouldn’t love them without it.
Comment by Matt Hilliard— September 13, 2012 #
Really enjoyed the way you framed write-up; it captures the way cons always feel so dissociative to me. I find the transition from convention time to post-convention time jarring. At the con, I have my schedule grid, highlighted in multiple colors, a clear path through the day, A then B then C then D. Afterwards, it all blurs: did I have that conversation Friday or Thursday? When did I play that game or see that costume or have that book recommended to me–or was it at a different convention altogether? Having the schedule grids on hand to reconstruct my memory is less helpful than I think it should be; so much of what happens is interstitial, not on the page. And the moments of connection–”Oh, you’ve read THAT!”–stand out against a backdrop of almost-but-not-quite-my-tribe. By the next con, they’re all I remember, and I’m enthused again. But immediate after, they feel too sparse, too few.
If you’re going to a con not knowing anyone, you could do worse than Capclave. It’s at least small enough that you’re likely to run into the same people over and over again through the weekend.

The Warriors have gotten back-to-back 3-pointers from Anthony Morrow and own a 65-60 lead with 7:30 left in the third.
No matter whether the Mavericks rally or not, they’ve already made life miserable for themselves tonight and, most likely, again tomorrow when they play for the second time in 24 hours, visiting Houston.
For Golden State, Vlad Radmanovic already has season highs in points (14) and rebounds (nine).
The Mavericks need to wake up and take this game seriously.

One of the most frequently asked questions I get is, "What kind of workout should I be doing for MMA or BJJ?" This same question, of course, could apply to any sport.
Sometimes you'll see magazine articles by strength coaches outlining workout programs for various sports and martial arts but I have a problem with this cookie-cutter approach: these programs end up being one-size-fits-all...but-me!
Creating workout programs is as much an art as it is science. Before slapping numbers into arbitrary sets and reps on paper you have to know something about the athletes with whom you're working because, in many cases, the wrong exercise prescription can do more harm than good. Martial arts and grappling are especially strenuous activities and the people who participate in them tend to be extremists already prone to falling into the dreaded overtraining. Participation in these arts provide, for the most part, the specific conditioning needed for same, i.e., if you want to be a good grappler, you've got to grapple; if you want to be a good boxer, you've got to box, etc. The smart strength coach analyzes his athlete to find the chinks in his armor. For example, if I have a BJJ player demonstrating better-than-average flexibility, with good muscular endurance, but lacking strength, it makes no sense to put him on a yoga-based conditioning program or endurance training. What makes sense is to bring his absolute strength up as high as possible. By the same token, if I have a fighter with great strength but no gas, and worse, tight connective tissue, I'm going to put him on an endurance-building program and work on freeing up his joints and increasing his mobility. This is how it's done, and following a program from a magazine may not suit your particular set of weaknesses. I want to work to the athlete's weakness--not his strengths--and no two athletes should have the same exact program (unless they happen to be twins.)
I'm going to give you another example: a program I created for myself. I've been in Philly for the past month, training at Maxercise in BJJ and submission wrestling. The workouts have been brutal. Lots of sparring and live drills. In the team practice sessions, there are times when everyone in the room has placed in the top 3 in the world, in their respective categories--we're talking about some truly elite training. As a 55-year old athlete, training with these kids takes a toll and I must be very careful in the way I add supplementary training. I noticed my shoulders and elbows were bothering me, in fact, both my shoulders were tweaked. I decided to create a program that would be shoulder-strengthening while simultaneously mobilizing, brief in time, without overtaxing my recovery and still allow me to practice the basic kettlebell skills needed for my upcoming seminars. Here's the prgram I settled on, which met my specific weaknesses:
1) Screw Press aka Bent Press
*this is an old-time lift that really hits the upper torso and works the shoulder at an odd angle you might just find yourself in when training BJJ. It's the only press I know that thoroughly works and stimulates the lats, which are major shoulder stabilizers.
2) Clubbell 3-Movement Kinetic Chain:
a) shield cast
b) mill
c) 45-degree angle lockout
*this kinetic chain puts your wrist, elbow and shoulder into all the submissions you might find yourself in during a jiu-jitsu match, thus strengthening the tendons and muscles at odd angles and producing freedom of motion, as well as strength.
3) One-Arm Long-Cycle Clean and Press
*this adds a whole-body element of conditioning. It's shoulder/arm intensive but with repeated, explosive leg drive, thus providing an overall metabolic effect.
None of these exercises are especially strenuous, when compared to double-kettlebell drills, so they don't interfere with my recovery from the heavy, live-grappling sessions. They specifically mobilize and strengthen my joints where I need it and allow me to recover from a heavy training schedule. In other words, this workout is basically a form of active recovery.
The sister workout is a heavy, low-rep, strength-based workout consisting of two movements:
1) a super-slow reverse Turkish Get-Up
* a standing, one-arm clean and press, then very s-l-o-w-l-y lying down, taking an entire minute to get down on the floor, then getting back up, taking a moment to pause in each position.
Included in this super-slow get-up were a side-plank and, once in the recline, an arm-bar.
One repetition of the entire exercise, using the 24 kg, took 2 minutes.
I super-set this with a set of:
2) Weighted Pull-Ups
* done slowly from a dead hang with a 10-second pause at the top with the throat over the bar.
I alternated these two exercises for three sets of each.
When I finished, I felt refreshed and recharged. My shoulders felt worked from every possible angle and I felt what I can only describe as a healing circulation of blood flow through the joints. I didn't need any more endurance work (I'd already had it with over an hour of live training, including takedowns and throws) so doing swings, snatches, and so forth would have been redundant. In weeks previous, I'd been doing sprints and stair sprints but the sudden increase in BJJ volume and live matches also made that type of training unneeded.
This is how I also analyze each of my personal training clients. In my next blog, I'll share how I analyzed my own son, world-class BJJ fighter Zak Maxwell, and the specific program with which he currently trains.
Yours in Strength & Health,
Coach Steve

Fantastic Blog Steve, I just recently found it after reading the "Naked Warrior" and searching your name. I spent the rest of that morning reading all the past entries. Thank you for taking the time to write it and for sharing your vast experience and expertise. It was great to see the accomplishments of your son, who is of course mentioned in TNW. A wise man once said you can judge a tree by its fruit and you can see the good fruit produced by the training methods you have developed in both you and your son. Looking forward to your thoughts on training kids as I am a father of three with another on the way.
Thanks again,
Scott
Hi Scott, Thanks for writing and the especially kind comments. I'm very proud of my son. Keep reading, we've got got a lot of ground to cover...Steve
I'd say great post Steve but I don't want to repeat myself all the time ;)
Just kidding - fantastic work.
And I have some BJJ related Q for you
- could you write something about your work with Saulo? How did your cooperation look like. What was your job exactly? Was he low-carber that time? BTW - did you work with Xande too?
- have you ever worked/trained/fight with Rickson? Is he really THAT good?
I remember - I guess Roleta while visiting Poland - said that Rickson is like from outer space and all those black belts from Gracie Barra didn't really know what he is doing to them. I wonder if that's true
thank you for your fantastic blog
Rafal
Hi Rafal, Sorry, I can't tell any details about the private training I did with Saulo and Xande because I was under contract with them and there are privacy issues.
Re: Rickson, I saw him in action at the Gracie Acadamy during the early 90's and yes, he's every bit as amazing as what the people say. Thanks for reading, Rafal.-Steve
OK, thank you Steve
I was asking about Saulo's diet coz I wonder if you know some other athletes who use some sort of low-carb dietes. We all know you do. I've heared dr Ellis worked with some good triathlon guy. Aajonus states he did it with some Karate guy too. But it's very hard to shift that paradigm that carbs and carb loading are essential for any athlete.
And I was kinda surprised reading here " If you're low-carbing, be sure to replenish glycogen with a post-workout carbohydrate/whey solution." I thought you dont do loading of any kind
Once again best regards from Warsaw, Poland
Hi Rafal, I've been using post-workout carbs for over a year now. My gf turned me onto it and I really liked the results. Very low carb diets make it near impossible to do HIIT but with PWO carbs it's not problem. I spoke to Ellis about it and he doesn't approve but it works for me. Read Anthony Colpo's suggestions. How's it going in Warsaw? I'm in Reykjavik right now. Steve
Iceland? Cool! What are you doing there Steve? Do you know that Icelandic men have the longest life expectancy in the world, living an average of 79.4 years. And it's funny that you are there, 'coz on polish low-carb forum we were talkin' like a week ago about Iceland and there native diet - and it looked a bit like Inuit I guess. Do you know what they like to eat and how it looked like in the past?
And Iceland is on my list of future visitations ;)
About carb loading - I'm in touch with one guy who is cyclist and low-carber. Every day he goes like 120km with average speed over 30km/h. He states he can generate 5,7W per kg for 30min! But - he eats 1gr of protein per kg of his body, coz over 1gr makes him weaker and fatigue kicks in. So his diet looks like that - 50-60gr of P, 30-40gr C and rest from saturated fat. Every time he tried to go like 100-120gr of protein he felt worse.
Do you know anything about this more protein > fatigue thing?
PS - It's ok in Warsaw and weather is getting better :)
Hi, Steve!
How heavy is your clubbell ?

Rainer

We're eating dinner outside again! We've had two days in a row of nearly 90 degrees! Phew! Because it's still May, the evening air cools down quickly. It's wonderful to have a breezy meal at the picnic table, rather than in a hot kitchen. Sometimes I'll prepare dinner in the morning, so that I'm not stuck at the stove at 5pm. This is the same salad I served to my printing class for lunch on the barn deck. A one bowl meal my entire family is excited about! I've been making variations of it since I managed a vegan restaurant in Marin County (California) 17 years ago. Did I just say 17? Is that possible!? Well, I guess I can honestly tell you that it's tried and true!
Cold Miso Noodles with Asparagus

- 1 1/2 cups water
I'll be back on Tuesday (Monday is Memorial day in the states)... hope your weekend is all that you want and need it to be!
This looks and sounds delicious. I will definitely give it a go. A manager of a vegan restaurant , very cool and just goes to show there is so much we still don't know about each other.
Have a super long weekend. It looks like you guys lucked out with the weather. Our long weekend was the last one when it was almost snowing .
Sounds very yummy!
That looks wonderful! Thanks for sharing the recipe. And the red tablecloth looks beautiful - perfect for an outdoor dinner.
What a beautiful picture. I've never had miso, but should give it a try. Your meal looks delicious.
I also adore your sewing machine. What a dream find.
mmm, that dish looks divine, and eating outdoors is the best! Just curious..where in Marin (I'm from there), from vegan restaurant, I'm guessing Fairfax? happy weekend!
Amber, the restaurant was called Garden of Eatin' (affiliated with the organic chip company) and was located in Larkspur. It was open in the early 90's. I loved Fairfax when I lived in Marin... vague but happy memories of seeing Zero play in some little park there.
The farmers' market is this afternoon--we are definitely having this for tomorrow's lunch!
yum! i always mean to make more cold noodle-y salads for dinner, and making it in the morning is a great idea! i'll have to try this; the sauce sounds divine...
yummm, this is SO on my list for dinner next week. Thanks for sharing it!
Lovely - I am sooo adding this to the summer din-din rotation...especially as most of the ingredients are floating around the kitchen anyhow. Amazing - that never happens. Thank you!
This looks delicious!! Thank you for sharing a recipe that stands the test of time :)
Happy Memorial Day weekend Maya!!
Thanks for sharing the recipe! I can attest that it is one of those meals that is light but also satisfying, and very easy on the tummy.
Mmmmmmmmm, lovely twist on the Japanesey! XXxx
Oooh YUM.
Have a gorgeous weekend Maya. It's cold & dark here.
YUM...these have always been my favorite....I remember you making these when I was little!!
It's so pretty with the chive flowers in it.
Ana- you remember them! You were 13! love you!
xox
I found you in the Artful Bloggers Mag. this weekend. Way to go!!!
Marin huh? Not far from me now.
yummy! cooking is the last thing i want to do when it's 90+ outside; soba noodles are very tasty cold though. i'll have to give this recipe a go. your lavender sachet is very easy on the eyes, the blue with the natural linen looks striking and goes along beautifully with the bee print.
What a blog filled with vital and important information this is .. It must have taken a lot of hours for you to write these yourself. Hats off from me for your hard work. Please come visit my site telephone companies when you got time.
That is some inspirational stuff... Never know that opinions could be this varied. Thanks for all the enthusiasm to offer such helpful information here. Please come visit my site answering services and give me any valuable feedbacks.
Thanks again for posting this recipe! I made it last night. Delicious and perfect for a warm summer day, ahhh. So, I've never commented on your crafty posts but I love reading your blog and look forward to your updates.
Thanks for sharing!
This sounds delicious! Thank you for sharing it and I'm super jealous of your warm weather!
Just made a variation of this sauce last night. The only difference is a little toasted sesame oil and a little less water. Yummm!

Not sure if anyone follows pro triathlon, but the Ironman Kona is going on right now. Former M swimmer and pro triathlete Andy Potts is pulling away in the swim (as expected). While Andy isn't among the favorites to win the whole thing, he's certainly making M proud early on! Go Andy and Go Blue! to watch it live if you are interested.|

If they want to open the season in the big leagues they better show up and take a roster spot. One the things LaRussa and Jocketty always did well was creating camp competition by bringing in seasoned veterans. Cedeno's been in the big leagues for several years. I'm sure he knows how to prepare for spring training. We'll see if any of the Cardinals younger infielders have been putting in their work in the off season.

United Way
Due to generous funding by the United Way, the Y continues to help youth become productive and engaged citizens. Early childhood and youth development programs at the YMCA open the doors of opportunity for education, leadership training, personal growth, service to others and social development.
Last year more than 15,000 youth participated in leaders clubs, Youth in Government, literacy services, after-school enrichment programs and other YMCA youth service activities.
Expanding programs for teens in particular is a priority that was identified in the Y’s 2009 strategic plan and as a result, the Y will continue to invest considerable capital and staff resources in the Carondelet, Downtown, Emerson, Monsanto and South City urban core branches to provide programs and services for youth.
The challenging economic environment has placed so much stress and strain on families in the greater St. Louis area. Those families are experiencing job losses and coping with increasing financial dilemmas.
Many YMCA families are forced to withdraw their children from child care, sports programs and other YMCA activities because it is no longer affordable. And yet, these families need Y programs now more than ever. Thanks in part to United Way funding, the Y continues to come to the aid of these families.

“We had a good turnout for an educational and fun afternoon
at McLaughlin Vineyards in Sandy Hook, CT on Saturday, June 5. The
afternoon began with a beautiful stroll through the Nature Preserve
property that adjoins the vineyard. As soon as the intrepid hikers
returned, they were met by Morgen McLaughlin who provided an insightful
and enjoyable wine tasting seminar for all. The winery produces
of a variety of wine each year from crisp Chardonnays to subtle
Merlots, and often has some more unusual yet refreshing varieties
such as apple wine. We were able to taste a wide range of wines
and purchase a few bottles to bring home. Following the wine tasting
we stepped outside to the patio for a wonderful brunch, with which
we were able to enjoy more of the wines that we had tasted. The
event was a great success and we are grateful to Morgen and the
McLaughlin family for graciously hosting the event for us. We hope
to return next year.”

From
sampling the vintages to hilltop views, a weekend on the wine trail
is a road trip for the senses. - by Jeanne Ricci Yankee Magazine
The skies have cleared,
which makes the entrance into the awe-inspiring Housatonic River
Valley and McLaughlin Vineyards -- via a tree-lined dirt road --
all the more dramatic. A sense of serenity overtakes me as I approach
the attractive winery, established in 1979 and located on a 160-acre
estate. Inside, the tasting room is tranquil, and the usual wine
accessories are for sale along with a variety of maple syrup products,
which are produced on-site. You can easily spend all day in the
area, mountain biking or hiking through several nearby state forests.
The lawn and perennial gardens surrounding the winery are ideal
for picnicking, and there is plenty of space for kids to run around.
In July and August, visitors drop in on the summer jazz series.
If you fall in love with this spot as much as I did, you can spend
the night in the winemaker's cottage for a cost of $150 and up,
depending on the season.

Skin Care Treatments: Beauty Today, Headaches Tomorrow

The allure of skin care products and treatments is a powerful one. If you watch TV, read magazines, or use the Internet regularly, you see dozens of daily advertisements for makeup, cleansers, “age-defying” creams, and beauty-enhancing treatments like tanning. Unfortunately, some of the ingredients in the skin-care products that you regularly use to look great […]

Nominations are now being accepted for the IMEX Green Awards 2009, to be presented at IMEX 2009, the worldwide exhibition for incentive travel, meetings, and events, May 26-29 in Frankfurt, Germany.
The annual awards, which have become increasingly popular as environmental awareness in the industry grows, include three category prizes and the Commitment to the Community Award, which recognizes an outstanding contribution to a local community.
The Green Meetings Award, the first category, is attracting more and more entries each year as corporations and agencies worldwide embrace the principles of green meetings and thereby demonstrate detailed environmental improvements and savings.
The IMEX Green Exhibitor Award was launched to educate and encourage exhibitors to employ a "reuse and recycle" strategy for their exhibit stand design and build.
The IMEX Green Supplier Award was launched last year as a way to publicly acknowledge meetings industry suppliers who play a critical role in helping the rest of the industry to achieve environmental objectives.
An independent judging panel made up of industry representatives and environmental experts chooses the winners.

If you are planning a meeting for the year 2000, you need to address the so-called Y2K problem. In brief: Most computers cannot properly process a post-1999 date field. The result is that without significant reprogramming, most computers could reject a date such as February 1, 2000 altogether, or erroneously interpret it as February 1, 1900.
In comparison to its potential impact on national defense or air-traffic control, the Y2K problem for the meeting planning industry is relatively minor. Nevertheless there are plenty of nightmarish scenarios to consider.
If the software used to track hotel reservations or meeting registration is not Y2K compliant, registrations could be lost, housing records could be wrong, and overbooking and/or undercounting could result. Indeed, hotels simply might not be able to process reservations accurately, which could lead to room-block errors, mistakes in food-and-beverage calculations, and erroneous attrition charges. Billing software glitches could lead to confusion over payments and credits.
The more complex the meeting the more likely it is that Y2K problems could increase exponentially. While you can be thankful you're not an air traffic controller, you've still got your work cut out for you.
Y2K Assurances It is increasingly common for customers to demand--and receive--written assurances that their suppliers are compliant, and that Y2K problems will not prevent them from performing their obligations. An unwillingness or inability to provide such assurances, particularly at this comparatively late date, is a red flag.
Assurances or representations concerning Y2K compliance also can be incorporated into written contracts. For example, meeting planners should try to get written assurances that the vendor:
* has reviewed its operations for Y2K compliance;
* has developed, or is developing, a program to address Y2K problems in a timely fashion;
* has made a related inquiry of its relevant suppliers and vendors; and, based on such review,
* is satisfied that Y2K problems will not cause material adverse effects on the performance of the contract.
Such representations should be backed up by a clause in which the meeting planner is indemnified against any losses arising from a Y2K problem.
What Goes Around Of course, turnabout is fair play. Meeting planners should be prepared to respond to similar requests from their own customers or others with whom they have contractual agreements. If it hasn't been done already, now is the time to review computer operations, determine Y2K compliance, and identify and address potential problems.
When responding to requests for Y2K compliance assurances from third parties, be sure only to make representations that are completely accurate. Ideally, any such responses should be reviewed by legal counsel. Whenever possible, seek to limit your organization's Y2K liability to third parties by excluding certain types of damages (e.g., lost profits) or, better yet, by excluding potential liability for Y2K problems altogether.
Late last year, President Clinton signed into law the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act. Its purpose is to encourage companies to share Y2K compliance information about their products and services. Thus, the act limits the circumstances under which Y2K disclosure statements can be used against the persons making them and imposes strict proof requirements in legal actions claiming fraud or defamation from a Y2K statement.
For the protections of the act to apply, the Y2K disclosure statement must be specifically identified as a "Y2K readiness statement." In addition, the act provides that exchanges of information that take place before 2001 and are designed to correct or avoid Y2K problems are not subject to antitrust laws.
Neither the meeting industry nor any industry that relies on computer-based information systems (and what doesn't?) is likely to make a completely trouble-free transition into the year 2000. With some planning and preparation, however, the Y2K bug's impact can be kept to a minimum.

The new $500 million Ritz-Carlton, Grand Cayman hosted two programs for insurance and financial services planners in early January: The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co.'s first insurance advisory board, held January 4 to 8, followed by an educational event January 8 to 11. Both included a variety of educational sessions and gave attendees the opportunity to experience the spectacular 365-room resort, targeted for high-end meetings and incentives.
Concurrent with the eagerly awaited gala opening, 10 industry veterans gathered for the insurance advisory board. “We deliberately kept it small and intimate so participants could share their thoughts,” says Pam Ferguson, director of insurance sales, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. LLC.
Rather than listen to formal presentations, the advisory board met in closed-door sessions to talk about their perception of luxury in the hotel marketplace. Led by professional facilitator Bob Joselyn, president and CEO, Joselyn Tepper & Associates Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz., they participated in various interactive exercises, including one that involved designing their ideal hotel chain. Also, they discussed such industry issues as the new seller's market and the challenges of flat-line budgets. “Interacting with a group of such seasoned professionals is an education in itself,” says advisory board member Sharon Chapman, CMP, CMM, travel and corporate events planner, Berkshire Life Insurance Company of America, Pittsfield, Mass.
The program concluded with an update by Ritz-Carlton's Bruce Himelstein, senior vice president, sales and marketing (see sidebar, below). “Educationally, it was very helpful to learn about Ritz-Carlton's strategic direction for the future,” notes Chapman, “and good to hear how much they value financial services and insurance business.”
Program Highlights
A larger group of industry planners (including some advisory board members) met January 8 to 11 for an event that included presentations by property developer Michael Ryan; General Manager Jean Cohen; renowned tennis coach Nick Bollettieri, who developed the resort's tennis center; and Alynne Hanford, global sales manager, group and meeting travel, American Airlines.
In her airline industry update, Hanford noted the rising cost of fuel — the greatest challenge to all carriers — as well as initiatives by American to “streamline the group process so it is easy, efficient, and productive.” American still offers refundable, changeable, zone group fares, she said, with a 154-person department dedicated to group sales, and another roughly 200 group reservationists. Among recent technology enhancements is a new online booking feature for groups that gives 5 percent discounts off the cheapest online rates.
In other highlights, planners toured the resort's 13,000 square feet of event space, experienced the 20,000-square-foot, $10 million Silver Rain spa; and learned about Ambassadors of the Environment by Jean-Michel Cousteau, an eco-educational family adventure program that introduces children to the natural wonders of the island. They also had a bit of their own adventure, sailing to Stingray City and swimming with the stingrays.
Participants enjoyed learning about the new resort, and learning from each other. “As a meeting planner, I am often invited on fam trips,” says Leanne Acton, CMM, director, conference planning and travel services, Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co., Horsham, Pa. “Generous offers to beautiful places, but who has time? Attending the Ritz-Carlton educational event was time well spent outside of the office because of the educational components — not just the speakers, but the opportunity to interact with my peers. My company benefited from my participation.”
In the Pipeline at Ritz-Carlton
Bruce Himelstein, senior vice president, sales and marketing, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. L.L.C., shared company news at Ritz-Carlton's first insurance advisory board in early January, and at the educational event that followed. The events marked the opening of Ritz-Carlton's 60th hotel. By 2008, Himelstein said, 14 more Ritz-Carlton properties will have opened, primarily in Asia and Europe. All will reflect a local “sense of place” in their design. Himelstein also reviewed new company standards for guest rooms, already incorporated into new hotels and to be included in upgrades of existing properties. Among them are “rainforest” shower heads, 400-thread-count sheets, flat-screen televisions, and Bulgari amenities.

Coast and Midwest editions are held each year.
The airline symposium, slated for February, is designed to bring together airline and hotel and lodging companies looking for a piece of the estimated $41 billion spent annually on lodging for airline crews and distressed passengers. Robert Gilbert, president and CEO of HSMAI, says this event would be the first of its kind. Twenty major airlines have signed on for the conference, says Gilbert. The date and location have yet to be announced.
The international show, called WorldQuest, will be held in three U.S. cities--New York, Chicago, and Washington--and will be for domestic meeting planners taking their meetings overseas. Twelve international hotel companies have already confirmed their place as exhibitors, says Gilbert. Dates and venues have not yet been determined for the WorldQuest shows.
HSMAI also announced that the 2004 Affordable Meetings West Coast show, slated for June 9 to 10, will be held in Long Beach, Calif. The 2003 show was held in San Jose.

Mercury watched the exchange with a knowing grin. She'd picked up on Ryuta's comment, and was amused by it. Was he afraid she'd be going bonkers right there and then? A viral Maverick, perhaps would- though they'd started way earlier than that. She, however... Had more self-control than that. "No worries: I'm free-will. I could even shake hands with one of them if there was any reason to," she stated when he stepped back and turned to address her again. "Might chat with them a bit if I don't find enough data elsewhere- that girl sure looks like she knows a lot," she added casually. It was clear by this Reploids behaviour he was no Maverick and knew her to be one.
Mercury's face stilled into a blank one when she was told what was happening. Bits and pieces, only? From His DNA? That was so... Underwhelming. It was a far cry from the real Sigma coming back, more powerful than ever, ready to rally all Mavericks into an all out war. To fool the Hunters into fighting one another, or further destroying themselves in an elaborate scheme. "... I guess that's the next best thing..." she conceded, releasing a sigh. This was the answer to the question she was prioritizing; but not the answer she would have liked to hear.
The nanite colony blinked in confusion, her head snapping to the side. "What the...", she hissed. Something was wrong. She'd just received a bunch of nonsense data from her smaller colony, before the connection was lost altogether. Had her backup just been attacked? Jammed? Downstraight malfunctioned? Each possibility was grimmed than the prior, and she strode purposefully, wanting to check on what the hell had gone wron with that parked taxi. She was... Upset, angry. If it was those feds shooting randome EMPS at anything that moved, she'd mess them up this time: it wouldn't do to have such dangerous weapons being shot so randomly.

Still he had little more reason to be here other than waste time needed to get more of the city out of the line of fire and possibly awakening themselves to their mistakes. He also wants to see what the colony would do once she encounters the culprits responsible for screwing with her loose pieces. Taking one more look at the fair, he starts to wander off after the colony, making sure not to cause more stress to her than what she was already witnessing from her own kin.

"Attention all festival goers, anybody who went to the Amusement Park today and can prove it by providing the mandatory bracelet admitting entry OR the stamp shall receive VIP Tickets to an exclusive event. The following people are admitted based on the fact they can prove their ID's when asked by the bouncer at the Lobby of the University: Mr. Teech Ordarium, Mr. Pen Cloud, Mr. Akamachi Tenzo, Mr. Ryo-Zero, and Mr. Kenji Nobuyuki. That's free admittance to the University district's exclusive event that happens in 30 minutes. Have a nice day." the speaker shut off.
It was obvious. IT was a sheer call out to five individuals. Teech Ordarium was way obvious, but after... Pen Cloud was "Penber Stratus", Akamachi Tenzo was "Chiba Masato", Ryo-Zero was Ryuta/Bionic Zero and Kenji Nobuyuki was Nobuyuki Kazuo... the soul-bound Reploid. It wasn't an actual invitation, but a call out to discuss something. Dr. S knew Ryuta was still in New Hera and had to speak to him from his remote location.

She arrived where she'd left the smaller colony... Only to find that the taxi wasn't there anymore: it'd gone away, leaving behind a small puddle of silvery liquid where it'd been parked, and drops of a similarly colored liquid along the road. It must be that new fuel that most machines and Reploids in this city used... Ordanium, right? Supposedly, it was a very efficient fuel... Mercury, thus far, had avoided coming into contact with any of it, though. Frowning, she walked over to the puddle, and knelt down beside it, watching the inert nanites. She could scan some pretty high residual energy reading from them: they'd been in the middle of helping themselves to the taxi's energy source when they'd been deactivated... Mercury tilted her head and dipped her left hand's index finger in the middle of the pool, attempting to restart some of the nanites and have them join up to her again.
Slowly, the liquid rose, enveloping her finger, then the hand...
...

Her entire forearm fell off, segmented as if it'd been cut clean, just as Mercury shrieked and jumped back, her eyes wide and her light trims flaring in alarm, watching as the puddle of inert nanites had grown, the empty carcass that'd been her hand now liquated aswell. What was that about? Shocked, the Maverick didn't even think about readjusting her arm again, craddling it like a wound instead.
That... Wasn't good: her own nanites had just been used against her: she didn't know how, but it had just happened: she'd lost more, by simply attempting to retrieve and restart the lost ones. She was in danger. Anything and everything could be a threat.

"You either have a lot of balls, are stupid, or have an amazing plan but the doctor has one task to ask while you're in New Hera. He apologizes he can't be here, but he's yet again fixing his Maverick creation up." the guard said. "The task is pretty simple. If you EVER see Elzareth again, in the next ever, give him this note." he said, handing a small note over to Ryuta.
It read "羨望は自尊心を打ちます。 嫉妬深いか。".
He looked around, noticing the others openly talking smack about Sigma and on top of that, actually plotting against him.

Ryuta stayed at the outskirts of the University, remembering their earlier warning to stay away. It probably didn't matter anyway as the bleeding had stopped and his cybernetic implants were busy mending the wound caused by the glowing prop.
Figuring it best not to risk the life and plans of the University for the sake of his own recovery, he turns around and leaves, deciding to find the detective and keep a distant watch to make sure no other hooligan attempt to ruin his investigation into Kazuo's true origin.
The attempt, however, was going to be hard due to how limited his spiritual senses were. He can sense the detective still within the city, but can't figure out where he wandered off to this time, or if he even left the area where he encountered that overblown anime adaptation. The best chance he has of staying on the detective's tail was to find out where Kazuo lived and head there to see if he was snooping around there.
He was certain Kazuo's abode was somewhere in the city, given the amount of presences that were familiar with him as a regular human being, so it would only be a matter of stumbling about until he found the place to get what he needed for the remainder of the time before Sigma comes bursting into the city. As much as he wants to stay focused on getting the civilians out of harms way, he knew not everyone was going to willingly choose their own life over that of a genocidal war machine, and forcing them was only going to cause more turmoil than maintaining the happiness of those who want more out of the upcoming future than to become another stain under his foot.
Keeping this in mind, and hoping Dr. S would at least understand his reason for not wanting to force the entire city to accept an offer they would rather not be apart of, Ryuta continues back towards the city, deciding to start with the outer ring and work his way inward to find where Kazuo originally lived.

Some minutes later, Lion was at the entrance to the school district. He could see people coming and going, something quite unusual compared to the quietness that left the rest of the city in a near-deserted state.
"Movement here is different from the rest of the town. Maybe I can get some real information?", Lion thought, as he stepped to the gate of the Top Triangle.

"Excuse me", he said, "I came to visit the city today, and I'm curious about the theme of the festival you guys seem to be setting up here."
If it went pulled out the right way, Lion could get some explanations about the events around the city.

Sunday Sweeties- Recipe Linky #29 – Christmas Feast
Christmas has been and gone for another year, though it still feels like Christmas to me.
This year we celebrated my side of the family’s Christmas on Boxing Day, due to people working, and everyone having the in-law sides to visit and spend time with. So rather than make everyone rushed and some people missing out, we moved our celebrations to Boxing Day.
Presents were first, with Santa (AKA Poppy) making a brief appearance with a gift for the three children.
Then it was time for lunch.
There was the usual overflowing table of food that was thoroughly enjoyed by all. And with full tummies, it didn’t matter how much time we left before dessert, there wasn’t a lot of room for more.
Do you think that stopped us though?
Tradition was followed. There was Pavlova, Christmas pudding, ice cream and custard. My mum made an amazing Trifle, and my Sister-In-Law made some White Christmas. There was also a sneaky Chocolate Bavarian in there somewhere. A plate of fresh fruit salad and a bowl of cherries helped us to feel a little better about our indulgences.
Did you make anything spectacular for your Christmas feasts? What was on your table?
We love reading what you share with us.

LET US PRAY
My innocent Jesus, by the merits of the torment You have felt, help
me to strip myself of all affection to things of earth,
in order that I may place all my love in You, who are so worthy of my love.
I love You, O Jesus, with my whole heart; I repent of having
offended You. Never permit me to offend You again. Grant that I may
love You always; and then do with me what You will.
Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, have mercy on us.
Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Dear Jesus, by the merits of your passion and cross, we present to you all our petitions.
Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be
Unto Christ, with pure emotion,
Raise my contrite heart's devotion,
Love to read in every wound.

"My favorite little mountain town." Rollinsville by caffeine_induced78
Rollinsville Travel Guide: 1 reviews and 2 photos
It's not hard to find the quiet little mountain towns in Colorado. You just have to pick a place on a map that does not have a ski area close by. Rollinsville is a town like this. For me it is the start of my favorite little corner - the Upper South Boulder Creek valley. If you think that only the big cities have anything to do in them then this is not the place for you. Here you will find some small workshops, a post office, a bar / restaurant, and a general store. In the future I would love to visit the town called Wingello that Jen (craic) has made famous on VT. In the meantime this is how I imagine Wingello - except Rollinsville has more snow and less horses.
- Pros:Just the right size, very friendly locals.
- Cons:It can get very windy.
- In a nutshell:a quiet Colorado mountain town.

Sorry to say, but as of May 2008, the restaurant has been closed and it is for sale. Too bad, hopefully there will be new owners soon, it is such a great location for this bar/restaurant.
yes there is way too much snow for it to be Wingello.....BTW you`ll love it there, especially when it rains and the frogs sing
(303) 258-3270... I dialed this number and some Jennifer Compton answered the phone. I´ve order couple of dozens of Buffalo Wings.. extra spicy... They are DHL´ing them over here. I think she was blonde.
you would probably like Donaghadee!
I thought this page might give something.sure did, outright down to earth perceptions...like that
Quite a rave review for the chicken wings! Chicken wings and a beer. Mmm. Must be dinner time.... that sounds good.
yea, dude, i dig your philosophy on that. what's with everyone adoring the urban environment, like we all forgot where we come from

"Jan's Birthday Present" Budapest by ChrisnJan
Budapest Travel Guide: 7,462 reviews and 17,200 photos
This is a beautiful city with plenty to see and do; we really enjoyed our stay here. The first two days were really quiet, everything was shut, we guessed it must have been a public holiday but we never found out for sure. On the third day everything came to life, the city became a busy metropolis and the visitor attractions were open to the public.
As with any major city there are plenty of places of interest to visit and anyone who is reasonably fit could reach most of them on foot. We bought a 72 hour Budapest Card from the hotel reception which cost HUF 6,500, this gave us unlimited travel on public transport and free or discounted entrance into many attractions, although to be honest, most of them were museums which were free anyway. Getting around the city was very easy with the card, the buses and trams are very frequent wherever you are aiming to go.
Budapest is not in the same league as Prague when it comes to nightlife, but it does have a good variety of restaurants and bars. I always like to try the local dishes when I am visiting a foriegn country and I am happy to say I thoroughly enjoyed every meal I had here. Every restaurant we went into concentrated mainly on traditional Hungarian dishes which we were more than happy with. There are a lot of boats moored along the river that have been turned into bars and restaurants, we had a very nice meal in one of them, unfortunately I cannot remember which one it was.

" The Tourist office was closed!" Top 5 Page for this destination Kongsberg Tourist Trap Tip by Azhut
Kongsberg Tourist Traps: 1 reviews and 1 photos
Don't go there without a map or a brochure of things that you can visit in Kongsberg because it can happen that you have no chance to enter the tourist office. It happened to me!! I went there at 1 p.m. and the office was closed; strange because in Italy most of the offices stay open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
By the way this is the address of the tourist office, better to know it before arriving there!

I stopped into Brass Door for lunch one afternoon. It’s one of those places that everyone seems to have tried except for me. I have heard great things about both the food and the atmosphere, so it was time to give it a try.
Since I went in during the week and on off hours, it was pretty slow. Other than one table of lingering businessmen (who obviously didn’t want to go back to work), Scott and I were the only people sitting in the place.
You could tell immediately this was an Irish Pub. Other than one or two beers, all the drafts were Irish. There was Celtic music playing over the loud speakers, and, with the decor, you feel like you just walked into Ireland. Someone obviously did their research before opening this place up.
Our server greeted us immediately, told us about the specials and got our drink order. He was very sweet.
I ended up choosing the I opted for the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, described as “Grilled marinated chicken breast, with lettuce, tomato and onion on toasted Ciabatta with Guinness mayonnaise”. They had me at Guinness mayonnaise. Instead of “hand-cut chips”, I opted for the sauteed veggies as a side.
The sandwich was great. The chicken seemed right off the grill, and the Guinness mayo gave the sandwich a different kick than other traditional chicken sandwiches one may consume. It tasted fresh, and the bread was warm and soft. My only qualm were the veggies. Yes, they were sauteed. However, they were sauteed in copious amounts of oil. I couldn’t even taste the veggies due to so much oil. After a couple of bites, I quit. These couldn’t be any healthier for me than fries, and, if that’s the case, I would rather have the fries.
Scott ordered the Tam o’ Shanter, which is their traditional Irish sandwich. It is describes as, “Warm ham and smoked turkey on toasted brioche bread with Swiss cheese, Mornay sauce, tomato and bacon.” He opted for the chips.
That is one big sandwich. There was so much to it, that it was almost impossible to eat. It was also greasy to the max. Translated, that means this is the perfect hangover sandwich. The fries were great. They were crisp and had a fresh herb seasoning on them that made them different than normal fries.
After we ate, our server invited us to their Wednesday Open Mic Nights. He says the artists are usually pretty good. There is a big turnout, and they have great drink specials during that time. I have not had a chance to go back yet, but I plan on it soon.
Overall, Brass Door is the place to go if you are looking for a good pint or some greasy bar food. The nightlife also seems to be kicking, but I have not experienced that first hand yet. The service is snappy and friendly, and they make you want to come back.
For more information on The Brass Door, visit their website, Facebook page, or Twitter. You can also check out other write-ups about them in Memphis Daily News, Eat Local Memphis, Paul Ryburn’s Journal, and Travel Host. Find more reviews at Yelp and Urbanspoon.
You mentioned that someone must have done their research about the Irish Pubs. The reason it seems so genuine and spot on is because it is – the investors hired a guy named Seamus that organized the place, menu, everything – he runs it. He’s the real deal. So better than research, someone that actually knows Irish Pubs.
Well, that totally makes sense! It is definitely the most authentic place in town. It reminded me very well of my trip to Ireland. Now, if only they hired a wait staff with accents.

1. Brevity Brotha!
Keep it short and sweet. Any successful professional has a lot going on. You’ve heard it before… time is money. If your proposal isn’t short, you run the risk of it being ignored, skimmed or sent to the back of the bunch for review later. The best idea is to create simple bullet points highlighting benefits and keep the entire proposal to a couple pages.
2. Layout is key!
If your portray before you can expect them to want to buy it. Make sure you ALWAYS have pricing directly next to any type of numbers such as traffic. If you show them the value, they’ll show you the money… well usually.
5. Who?!
Always include demographics. Some people are ONLY interested in demographics. In other cases, if you have a special demographic, you might peek someone’s interest in what you’re offering just because you called out the specialized population. Including demographics shows that you know what you’re offering.
6. Don’t be a dummy!
Remember to proof read. proposal. Maybe on their phone, maybe printed out, maybe at a computer. Even though any prospect will likely already have your information from your email, make sure to include the contact information on the [...]

11 Word of the Year Candidates That Didn't Catch On
Mobile out-of-office workers earned their own noun in 2008, when "moofer" was a candidate for the Oxford American Dictionary (OAD) Word of the Year. The suggested verb form? Moofing, as in "I won't be at the meeting Thursday, I'm moofing from Starbucks."
2. Deleb
Voted 2009's "Novelty Word," a deleb is a dead celebrity. It was listed by OAD alongside the arguably more useful "tramp stamp."
3. Googlegänger
Lots of people have a Googlegänger. That's the person with your name who shows up in search results when you google yourself. ("Google" as a verb was recognized as 2002's "Most Useful Word" by the American Dialect Society.)
4. Mellencamp
A woman who is too old to be a cougar can be called a mellencamp, thanks to 2011's ADS "Most Outrageous" Word of the Year, inspired by singer John Cougar Mellencamp's multiple name changes.
5. Sardoodledom
This selection from Merriam–Webster's Word of the Year list in 2004 is a one-word noun which describes a stage play with an overly dramatic or morally objectionable plot, derived from the name of French dramatist Victorien Sardou.
6. Infobahn
Just as the autobahns are Germany's coordinated federal expressway system, the infobahn is the information superhighway (the winner in 1993). The term was voted 1994's "Most Promising" Word of the Year by the ADS.
7. Blamestorm
Another M-W pick from 2004, blamestorm describes a meeting or discussion held for the sole purpose of assigning blame for a failure.
8. Pecksniffian
From Charles Dickens' character Seth Pecksniff, a pecksniffian is a person who hypocritically affects a high moral standing or practices pecksniffery, the universally irritating art of being sanctimonious. "Pecksniffian" and its derivatives were chosen by Merriam–Webster as one of 2007's Words of the Year.
9. Heaven-o
Because 80% of "hello" is from H-E-double-hockey-sticks. The entirely useless "heaven-o" was elected "Most Unnecessary" by ADS in 1997, never to be mentioned again (until now).
10. Flog
"Flog" has been a verb meaning "to beat or to whip" since the 17th century, but in 2006 it was a runner-up in the Oxford English Dictionary Word of the Year list as a noun: fake+blog, or a website that appears to be real but is actually just a form of marketing or advertisement for a company.
11. Carrotmob
A carrotmob is the opposite of a boycott: A group of people gather to support a business by descending upon it en masse and shopping there all at the same time. The word was one of those shortlisted by Oxford Dictionaries in 2008; it comes from the name of the website used for organizing such things.

Just when you think you’ve got it all sorted out in your head – and just when you’ve been nationally recognised! – there’s a curve ball thrown at you!? Typical.
Incidentally, this has happened to me before … I spent a year writing a proper mental health policy for my force in 2005/6. In doing so, I solicited officers’ views about ANY and ALL questions and queries on mental health so that I could ensure they were addressed in the policy. I carefully listed everything they asked to ensure that what they wanted addressing in operational guidance was included. I considered it a job well done when I published it until a sergeant rang me up to complain that the situation he wanted advice on wasn’t mentioned at all and that my new policy “wasn’t very much use, really”. Thanks, Sarge!
Today, an AMHP presented a situation to me that I’ve never encountered before, albeit I have read about “guardianship”. I read about it partly to try to understand why the police never seem to get requests in connection with it. By definition, guardianship involves patients who remain at liberty and therefore a reduced need for coercion reduces the need for the police. << That’s one of the saddest sentences I’ve typed on this blog, as the police should not be just the coercive arm of the mental health system.
In fairness to the AMHP who I know well, he hadn’t dealt with this kind of situation before either and his need for police support caused me to think I should cover the subject, in case some officers across it.
WHAT IS GUARDIANSHIP?
It may be that some think of the legal status of mental health patients as being either “inpatients” or “outpatients”. Inpatient in a psychiatric hospital, either voluntary or detained under the Mental Health Act; OR “outpatients” under community mental health teams.
Guardianship is something in between, but in my experience, the police service hear of this very rarely indeed – probably because by definition of it, patients are prepared to engage with it and considered able to live in an arrangement where their physical liberty is not totally restricted. It should be noted in particular, that guardianship is totally different to Community Treatment Orders, and should not be confused with it, although both are options for community care which impose restrictions or limitations of various sorts.
Under Section 7 of the Mental Health Act, a person may be placed in to guardianship upon the application an AMHP or the patient’s nearest relative if they have received the medical recommendations from two doctors. A criminal court can also instigate guardianship under section 37 of the Act, if two medical recommendations suggest it is appropriate after a conviction for an offence or a finding of the act being done.
A patient received into guardianship may be required by the guardian to do certain things: “reside at a specified place, attend specified places at times for medical treatment, occupation, education or training; to ensure access for any registered medical practitioner or Approved Mental Health Professional.”
TRANSFERS AND WARRANTS AND AWOLS
Where a patient is received into guardianship in one local authority, it may become necessary to transfer them to a new guardian in a new area, much like inpatients are occasionally transferred between hospitals. All of this is covered in s19 of the Act and if need be, that transfer can be effected by the use of reasonable force.
Where access to a premises is not enabled, a warrant can be sought under section 135(2) to force entry in order to transfer a patient under guardianship. << This is what the AMHP was asking for, in the example which gives rise to this post.
If a warrant is secured for this purpose, then the police will need to be involved because only the police can execute the warrant. Of course, any conveyance which is subsequently necessary, should be done in accordance with the Code of Practice which presumes ambulance transfer.
If a patient absents themselves from the care of the guardian, then they become AWOL for the purposes of the Mental Health Act and may be re-taken by a police officer, an AMHP or anyone authorised in writing by the guardian or the local social services authority. If entry to a premises must be forced, in order to re-take someone received into guardianship, then a warrant under s135(2) is required.
This is no different to the re-detention of an inpatient AWOL from hospital under the MHA. Of course, guardianship being less restrictive on a patient’s liberty, having been re-detained and returned to the guardianship from which they were AWOL, they cannot be then compelled to remain there, unlike an inpatient under a section like 2 or 3.

Devil’s Advocate; An ungrateful relative who may be ‘Acting In Bad Faith’ could provide embellished/misinformation to police regarding the relatives mental health. Police on the side of caution may take the person in question for a mental health assessment. If that detainee is refused call to lawyer & refuses to see psychiatrist until call provided to lawyer, the medical staff may deem that as non co-operating and force the detainee to remove clothes, force them to take medications against their will. Think it doesn’t happen, guess again.
Police need to ensure they are not taking the wrong person for a psychiatric examination. This article on “Guardinship” scares the hell out of me when I vision capable seniors.citizens attempting to defend themselves without a call to lawyer against someone presenting misinformation to police for personal gain, be it to gain control over the person’s estate, financial affairs, or have control over where they are to live and what medications they are forced to take.
A citizen’s life could be adversely affected needlessly. Nothing like opening a can of worms, but if it gets people talking together in forums and Blogs I’m all for it, we all learn, I hope!
If it gets people talking together in forums and Blogs … well, here goes. As a mental health service user, it comforts me that due to presumably to limited funds there are less psychiatric beds than many ‘carers’ and healthcare workers would like. I won’t get a knock on the door by the police and three people sent by my consultant psychiatrist if there aren’t any beds!
It is, however, of concern that psychiatrists can control citizens in the community, through the police. What is the upper limit of the numbers affected other than the unsatisfactory criterion of their being deemed a ‘danger to themselves or to others’?
“deemed a ‘danger to themselves or others’” there lies the problem, at least in Canada, not sure about policy where you are, here in Canada some provinces like British Columbia where I reside, police are not required to see a citizen do anything, they can just rely on information provided to them from a caller or rely on verbal information from another person.
We take no issue with police involuntarily detaining and treating incapable citizens who may be at risk of harming themselves or others. Even if the police are unsure, and erroniously assume the person is incapable and a risk to self or others, the detainee (which could be capable and not at risk) could in fact be institutionalized and drugged because they refuse to meet with psychiatrist, (because medical staff refused them their requested call to lawyer to determine if detention is lawful and to inform lawyer where they are, and for lawyer to inform a family member to make arrangements for their (the deatinee) obligations in caring for family members etc.).
I hear so often from police that it’s not a police decision to have the proposed patient detained and treated, that’s up to medical staff to decide, then police leave hospital and are finished with the person, not knowing what exactly happed to that citizen.
No person with a mental illness, or a person being treated as such can be discriminated against. So when society allows criminals a call to lawyer without delay, and refuses detained citizens being held under mental health law their requested call to lawyer, then I see that as clearly discriminating against that person.
Maybe to treat everyone as equal we should deny criminals their call to lawyer, but then what kind of Society do we want to live in.
Please don’t misread this comment, Citizens at Risk of Harming Themselves or Others Must be Detained and Treated if Necessary. I did mention in my last post it’s a can of worms.
I live in the UK and have had contact with more than one British police force in connection with the Mental Health Act. I should like to acknowledge firstly that the police officers I have met have almost without exception been very helpful and good humoured, despite their patience being occasionally tried). Given my respect for the police it is embarrassing to have had them involved. On one occasion I was watching TV and there was a knock on the door. I opened it to find two policemen, a psychiatrist who worked for my consultant, a social worker and a GP from a neighbouring town. The latter GP explained I didn’t seem to be quite myself. I replied that her observation surprised me since I didn’t believe we had met before. This she conceded but went on to assure me that she had read my file. That exchange was almost the full extent of the ‘assessment’ and I was left to be driven in a police car to a psychiatric ward (all obviously pre-arranged). The whole thing was farcical or would have been except that it was a waste of police time. (The waste of time they might have expected because on a previous occasion I had been escorted to hospital, just as reluctantly, by my community psychiatric nurse on the bus and over my entire history I have never physically resisted involuntary detention).
I am not convinced that citizens at risk of harming themselves should always be restrained (but that view is probably too risky for professionals to abide by). I certainly agree that society has a right to protect itself from persons at risk of harming others. But then surely you might as well lock up everyone who has had a few drinks too many!
Hi, I have always thought your posts were both thoughtful and thought provoking, as is this one. However one slight disagreement,you state that the situation described is no different to the AWOL of an inpatient from hospital. But such an AWOL patient would still be “liable to be detained”,this is not the case with a person under a Guardianship. Which is a bit weird as they can be compelled to return but not to stay? Unless they have also been made subject to the DOLS prevision of the Capacity Act. Alex Davis
I can see the point you are making and I will ammend the wording to reflect what I meant – I meant “liable to be detained by the police in order to be returned.” You are obviously quite correct that they cannot be required to then remain detained. The wording was intended for the police officers managing a re-detetention, as opposed to the Guardian themselves keeping the person detained.
Good point, well presented!
Thanks,hope to see you at the Mental Health Action Group meeting on Monday. Cheers Alex Davis.

Number of books read in July: 19
Number of books read in 2012: 85
Number of books read in 2012: 85
■ The Age of Miracles (Karen Thompson Walker) Fiction. I loved this quiet work of post-apocalyptic fiction, even if others didn't. There is something about summer reading for me, though: It's more... forgiving.
■ The Group (Mary McCarthy) Fiction. Robin at 52 Books challenged folks to read a NYT bestseller from the week and year they were born. As it happens, The Group was #2 during my week. It was a dated but compelling read.
■ Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything (Joshua Foer) Non-fiction. This was our audio accompaniment for our ill-fated trip to the Illinois Shakespeare Festival. Related entry here.
■ Amped (Daniel H. Wilson) Fiction. Entertaining if thin sci-fi from the author of Robopocalypse, which I enjoyed last summer.
■ Happy Endings Are All Alike (Sandra Scoppetone) YA fiction. My Chapter 8 -- "Him She Loves: Romanced, Rejected, Affianced, Dejected" -- choice for Girl Detective's "Summer of Shelf Discovery" reading project. Related entry here.
■ Falling for Hamlet (Michelle Ray) YA fiction. I wanted this to be better than it was. Sigh.
■ A Thousand Cuts (Simon Lelic) Fiction. "But trust me. Being bullied: it bites." Quite possibly the best book I've read this year. Related entry here.
■ The Tale of Paradise Lost: Based on the Poem by John Milton (Nancy Willard) Fiction. With the Misses. This abridgement has both fans and foes. I will simply say that it's serviceable.
■ The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need (Andrew Tobias) Non-fiction. Rudimentary but helpful.
■ Brain Power: Improve Your Mind as You Age (Michael J. Gelb and Kelly Howell. Non-fiction. A repetitive retread of the same ol' "feed your mind, eat right, exercise" advice you've heard before. Neat bit of synchronicity, though: Tony Buzan, whose memory empire is featured in Moonwalking with Einstein, penned the introduction.
■ Things We Didn't See Coming (Steven Amsterdam) Fiction. I know I've heaped superlatives on this month's reading, but Amsterdam's collection of related short stories set in utterly recognizable and believable post-apocalyptic world was, in a word, brilliant.
■ Get Out of My Life, But First Could You Drive Me and Cheryl to the Mall? (Anthony E. Wolf, Ph.D.) Non-fiction. Read this as "research" for a piece You know what? This book actually frightened me. Apparently, some teenagers are really quite awful. Note to self: You won the parenting lottery. Thank you, LCpl M-mv and Misses.
■ Pariah (Bob Fingerman) Fiction. Gratuitously violent and crass. Cardboard characters. A thinly explained "twist." The illustrations were the most compelling aspect of this otherwise mediocre bit of zombie fiction.
■ The Paleo Diet (Loren Cordain) Non-fiction.
■ The Primal Blueprint (Mark Sisson) Non-fiction. Others have probably already observed that these seem like a rehash of Atkins. If, like me, you're late to the low-carb discussion, The Paleo Diet was the more readable text. Sisson's presentation was repetitive and poorly organized.
■ How to Retire Overseas (Kathleen Peddicord) Non-fiction.
■ Where to Retire (John Howells) Non-fiction. I keep returning to this topic, making new and improved (tentative) plans, running the numbers with all sorts of scenarios in mind. It's not so much that I read such books as pore over them, adding notes to my "Retirement" file, daydreaming, and reading sections aloud to Mr. M-mv.
■ The Outsourced Self (Arlie Russell Hochschild) Non-fiction. Related articles here and here. The Time Bind and The Second Shift fascinated me, but this one... not so much. It may be partially my fault, though: I've been reading it in fits and starts for about six weeks.
■ Epic Fail (Claire LaZebnik) YA fiction. Loosely patterned on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, this was almost painfully cute.
4 comments:
I requested Things We Didn't See Coming, A Thousand Cuts, The Wave, The Project, Wool Omnibus, and The English Teacher from the library.
Thank you. :-)
Heather
Based on the above, check out Maureen McHugh's AFter the Apocalypse story collection, and The Four Hour Body.
Get Out of My Life has been recommended to me for years. I own it, got it for 50 cents at a library sale years ago, but never read it. Yesterday while unpacking I found it and put it aside to read, finally. Funny you mention it here. I have no clue what the book has in store for me, can't wait to see if after reading it I will think I hit the parenting lottery also.
Heather, you're welcome. :o)
Kristin, I loaded the collection onto the Kindle when you first mentioned it on your site.
Christine, you did. Hey, and best wishes in your new home.

Websters Dictionary states that Hydrophobia is "the mortal fear of water" literally being scared to death of water. Hydrophobia is not a fear of swimming but a fear of all water. Hydrophobia is a mental disorder, specifically a Specific Phobia Anxiety Disorder. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association classifies a Specific Phobia as 300.29.
If a Scout is diagnosed with Hydrophobia or other physical or mental disabilities, his Chartered Organization notes this on his youth application. The Scout's Medical Record should reflect any disabilities as well. His local council reviews any Medical Record, Individualized Education Program (IEP), and other resources and can certify that the Scout has Special Needs. The Council Advancement Committee can then approve Alternate Requirements for this Scout. See Special Needs for details.

Wikimedia Blog/Drafts/Access2Research
Final draft of blog post [edit]
This is a draft for a blog post that the Wikimedia Foundation published on May 25, 2012 to support the Access2Research petition. The FAQ is available on enwiki and has been reviewed by the communications committee.
The Wikimedia Foundation endorses mandates for free access to publicly funded research [edit]
Scholarly information is often too expensive to access. Academic publishers sell journal subscriptions for thousands of dollars per journal per year. Typically, only universities and large libraries, not individuals, are able to pay those fees, which limits access to researchers and others affiliated with institutions with money.
Are these costs justifiable when the underlying research is publicly funded and the underlying goal is public knowledge? If you're a taxpayer you've already paid to fund the research, so why should you pay essentially another tax to read the findings of that research?
On May 20, a team of longtime advocates for public access to scholarly information launched a campaign to urge U.S. President Barack Obama to "require free access over the Internet to journal articles arising from taxpayer-funded research." Opening up publicly-funded research will "provide access to patients and caregivers, students and their teachers, researchers, entrepreneurs, and other taxpayers who paid for the research." This is consistent with Wikimedia's non-profit mission "to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally."
Wikimedia project volunteers, who are among the taxpayers, should not be denied free access to this information. They should be empowered to read it, report on it, and cite it. Wikipedia and its sister projects depend on the energy and unselfish dedication of this team of contributors—volunteers, researchers, and amateurs—who read and investigate sources as they work to compile accurate, up-to-date, verifiable knowledge. Each month, hundreds of millions of global readers view, and have the opportunity to evaluate and contribute to, Wikimedia content. Many do not have the means (nor should be required) to pay for knowledge, including useful economic, health, and scientific information, when their taxes fund the research.
We believe in open access and free licensing as fundamental forces to disseminate knowledge, support education, and accelerate discovery.
Today, the Wikimedia Foundation is endorsing this petition, joining thousands of individuals and organizations expressing support for free access to taxpayer-funded research articles. We hope you will join us, too—anyone over 13 can sign.
Please consider signing this petition to mandate that all research funded by U.S. taxpayers be made freely available to the citizens of the Web.

Grizzly G0516 Combo Mini Lathe with Mill
Like all Lathe/Mill combos, it fills the job of 2 machines in 1 and will be very suitable for small shops and definitely kinder on the credit card than buying both a lathe and a separate milling machine.
Although, if you can afford the outlay, having lathe and mill as separate pieces of machinery will save time as you won’t have to switch adjustments swinging from lathe over to mill.
But how often will you be turning something down and need do some milling?
If it’s not often, then go for a combo mini Lathe/Mill.
The Grizzly Lathe GO516 Technical Details:
- Distance between centers: 21″
- Lathe motor size (Single-phase, 110V): 3/4 HP
- Lathe spindle bore: 3/4″
- Mill/drill motor size (Single-phase, 110V): 1/2 HP
- Swing: 9-3/4″ (lathe), 12 3/4″ (mill/drill)
- 6 speeds
There is a full review by an expert over at Amazon, and though this lathe/mill stacks up well, for a few extra dollars you may find the Shop Fox M1018 a little sturdier and more straight forward to use.
Still, the Grizzly GO516 will handle most projects that a smaller shop will attempt plus save money and space.

Half Blood, the new Horseback album, has just been released on their Relapse Records Bandcamp page. This is an album that takes you on a journey. Starting with americana black metal; twisted boogie grooves, repetitive twangy guitars, and harsh blackened vocals. Ending with full on krautrock droning; gorgeous layers of organ and guitar, and the gentle tick-tock of electronic drums. Here's a couple of reviews from AllMusic and The Inarguable, and here's an interview Invisible Oranges did wth Jenks Miller, the man behind Horseback.
[Go to the post to view the Bandcamp player]
On first listen, I didn't really like the harsh vocals mixed with the groovy guitars, but then I found myself wandering around singing "Ahriman" for a full week, so I guess it worked its charms on me.
It is strangely addictive music. What do you think of the electronica / krautrock / droning parts?
It's one of those things that, on paper, shouldn't work at all, but yet it does. I've heard other, more americana/alt country-type bands bring in krautrock influence (The Jayhawks' "Dying on the Vine" immediately comes to mind, which they said was inspired by the band Can), so it can definitely be done and done well. Having listened to the Horseback album a few times now, I think the variety of influence is what makes the droning part work. They manage to blend it all together, so it doesn't sound like a ridiculous genre mash-up, and it keeps the drone parts from being a never-ending slog of boring.
Yeah, the album sounds remarkably cohesive despite the variety of influences. Or, as you say, because of that variety.

Our goal is to have the most comprehensive Metal Band archive, period.
Other places, alot of really good bands do not qualify it be included due to one or more of suggested guidelines for acceptance. Why? Because they are not "famous"?
Famous does not necessarily mean good. There are alot of "popular" things that are horrible. We do not rule talent by "chart sales". Lots of crap sells well, yet it's talentless noise. Hip hop proves this formula with flawless perfection.
Well, not here. Granted, we are not out to be a local band repository, but if a band is good and noteworthy, they should be mentioned.
HERE you can:
You will find a number of great death, thrash, speed, and heavy metal bands, albums, and profiles of their musicians. Included among the metal bands, there is also entries of other bands and people connected in one way or another to the metal bands listed as well.

Tossing my horrible review title aside, this album is a great piece of power metal mastery. I know I’m only echoing other reviewers here when I say this album is incredible. The entire band is in top form here and every song is a classic. There are no dull moments at ALL in this album. My favorite track is of course the 13-minute epic “Halloween.” The double guitar tremolo melodies in this track keep me coming back for more. The remaster definitely sounds better than the previous release. If you already have that, then throw it in a dumpster or give it to a used CD store, because you won’t be needing it anymore.
Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt. 1 is Helloween’s greatest album and no metal fan should be without it. Be sure to check out Keeper of the Seven Keys, Pt. 2

If Bo recognized both the recruiting advantage and the crowd advantage of later games, especially under the lights, he'd play them all at night. To assume otherwise proved to me you've never met Bo, nor do you understand the intricacies of college football.
FWIW: LSU has played 37 home night games since 2005, and have averaged a top 5 recruiting class ever since. Les knows Bo!
I prefer noon games. And we've had too many 3:30 or later games this year anyway.
Also good news not having this on the BTN.
Go Blue! Always!
I prefer noon home games and 330 road games.

Kansas State coach Ron Prince has taken a liking to his black cowboy hat. But it was probably buried underneath play charts and statistics this week as the No. 25 Wildcats prepare to face Big 12 South co-leader Oklahoma State at 6:05 p.m. Saturday at Boone Pickens Stadium. Prince knows his team must be on top of its game as the Wildcats seek their fourth-straight win against a South opponent.
"We're going to play an opponent at a place that is always very tough," said Prince, the second-year coach who will travel to Stillwater, Okla., for the first time. "From what I can ascertain it's getting tougher and tougher with the way they're building their environment."
While Oklahoma State students spent the week pomping floats for their Homecoming celebration, construction crews were finishing up concrete work to connect the newly-erected bowled western section of the stadium with the north stands to form a unified look for the stadium. At 46 percent complete, a project manager told The Associated Press earlier in the week that construction was ahead of schedule, thus making it only a matter of time before the 44,700-capacity stadium grows into one of the largest in the league.
Meanwhile, the Cowboys, 4-3 overall and 2-1 in the Big 12, who come off a historic win at Nebraska, hope to be on schedule for a massive three-game homestand.
K-State, 4-2 and 2-1, will mark first of three ranked foes as the Cowboys host No. 19 Texas and then No. 15 Kansas.
"Everybody's glad to be home because obviously we enjoy playing here and there's just generally a comfort zone when you're not traveling, not in airplanes, not in hotels," said Gundy, who has won nine of his last 11 home contests. "But when they watch tape of this team, they won't have any problem looking past this team."
K-State has already made two strong showings on the road in a 23-13 loss at then-No. 18 Auburn and in a 41-21 win against then-No. 7 Texas, which marked the program's first-ever road win against a Top 10 opponent and the Longhorns' worst home loss since 1997. The Wildcats will try to do something they have failed to do in their last three opportunities (2005, 2003 and 2001) and beat two South teams on the road in the same season. They last did so by beating a ranked Texas team and Oklahoma State away from Manhattan in 1999.
The Wildcats' three straight wins against South opponents is the longest current streak by a North team. Colorado has won its last two against the South.
K-State has won 10 of the last 11 against Oklahoma State, including four of the last five in Stillwater. After posting a 44-21 victory there in 1999, the Wildcats lost 38-34 in 2003.

Part of the patchwork that is Miami is the different villages, towns, and neighborhoods that comprise Miami. There is the international banking center of Brickell and business center Coral Gables which is next to the rich cultural expressions found in Coconut Grove. The city center or downtown has the AA Arena and home of the Miami Heat and Florida Marlins and the cultural center of south Florida, the Adrienne Arsht Center. Downtown has its emerging satellite areas of the Design Distict, Wynwood Area, and Midtown; all of which enrich Miami with their abudance of culture, dining, nightlife and shopping offerings.
The Northern Beaches have some of the best shopping in the world with the Aventura Mall and Bal Harbour Shoppes along with fashion boutiques found off the beaten path. The beaches such as Surfside and Sunny Isles and others all are all excellent with powerdery beaches and offer a slower pace than what you may find in the sister beaches to the south.
And finally that brings us to the American Riviera , Miami Beach, with its prized jewel South Beach or SOBE. South Beach draws travers from around the world for its pulsating nightlife, as well as marquis events; Fashion Week, Food and Wine Festival, South Beach Polo and the mother of all art fairs, Art Basel.

After she briefly spoke to the press last night, Michele Bachmann took a little extra time with the conservative blog The Shark Tank to back Karen Harrington, a Republican who's running in a primary against candidate Joe Kaufman. They're hoping to unseat U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. That's a tall feat. Wasserman Schultz is highly popular in overwhelmingly Democratic Broward County and she's the Democratic National Committee chair.

I can already hear the shrieks and imagine the flying spittle at The Family Foundation ("TFF") over Terry McAuliffe's endorsement of same sex marriage. For those not in Virginia, McAuliffe is the apparent Democrat candidate for Governor of Virginia who will likely face off against the frighteningly delusional and religious extremist extraordinaire Ken "Kookinaelli" Cuccinelli. As Attorney General, Kookinelli has done all in his power to issue legal opinions that leave LGBT Virginians with no legal protections of any kind whatsoever. One can be certain that TFF will be sending out hysterical missives across its network to endeavor to rally the knuckle draggers and religious fanatics to rally to the GOP standard. The Washington Blade looks at McAuliffe's statement. Here are highlights:
Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe on Friday publicly backed marriage rights for same-sex couples for the first time.
.”
“McAuliffe will be the first Virginia gubernatorial candidate to support same-sex marriage,” he noted to the Washington Blade. “I’m pleased to see that voters will have a clear choice to make.” . . . . A spokesperson for Cuccinelli’s campaign did not immediately return the Blade’s requests for comment.

What is an Annotated Bibliography?
The Annotated Bibliography, or A.B., is the written record of your research
process. Without a continuously updated A.B., you can't show that you're
actually conducting research.
The A.B. is always longer than your References page at the end of an
APA-formatted paper. This is because you include everything you have considered
in your research - it is a full record of your research. The References
page at the end of an APA-formatted paper includes only those sources
you "reference" or use.
You will hand in an A.B. with every draft along the way to the final
research project.
How do I do the A.B.?
The A.B. is fairly straightforward. Like the References page to an APA
Style paper, it is organized alphabetically. In fact, you follow the same
format as you do on the References page. If you're on the ball, you'll
simply paste your formatting from the A.B. to the References page as you
complete a draft. In other words, just paste the reference for the sources
you use in the paper from the A.B. to the References page.
>You should have a clear heading for your A.B. It should have your
name, the course, the title for your paper/project, and Annotated Bibliography.
>For each source you look at in your research, you'll include the reference
(the citation) in APA format. This is the "bibliography" part
in the annotated bibliography.
>In addition to the "bibliography" part, you need the "annotated"
part. An annotation is 6-12 sentences that does two things. First, it
provides a basic overview of the source - a brief summary or distillation.
Here, it is often helpful to indicate key terms or concepts in the source,
particularly if they might come in handy later. Second, and this is very
important, it indicates how and why you think the source might prove useful
for your project (or why it won't prove useful). You must have these two
elements for each annotation. Each research assignment in the course asks
you to prepare the material that goes into this kind of annotation. You
could simply paste the relevant text from your research assignment into
the A.B.
>That's all. (You might put each source on its own page if you like,
but it isn’t necessary. Also, annotations can be single-spaced to
save room!)

The Global Argument for the Keystone Pipeline March 2, 2013Posted by geoff in News.
trackback
Reading about the latest environmental impact report for the Keystone pipeline (no effect on global warming) made me wonder why the President and his administration hate other countries. You see, the report apparently goes on to say that we don’t really need Keystone to meet America’s energy needs:.
Let me just outline the following argument:
- We’re teetering on global recession
- Lower oil prices help economies
- More oil generally means lower oil prices
- Building Keystone makes more oil available
- …and creates US jobs and increases exports
- …which I thought was part of the master plan
- So WTF? Build the damn pipeline and promote other oil projects, and help the world dig itself out of this recession while lining our own pockets along the way.
Unless you hate those other countries, that is.
Added global argument: we import more oil from Canada than from Saudi Arabia. Canada is our largest energy importer.
And also the United State’s hat.
If the US was as hot for invading countries for their oil as the liberals have claimed for the last 20+years they’d be speaking American in Toronto by now.
Teetering? I’m pretty sure we’re already inside the rabbit hole now.
So WTF? Build the damn pipeline and promote other oil projects, and help the world dig itself out of this recession while lining our own pockets along the way.
If there’s a chance that human beings will benefit generally, or the US will benefit spefically, it is wrong and evil and not gonna happen.
Environmentalism is just Marxism with pimp threads and a walking stick.
Comment of the year, Dave.
Michael?
Also, one of my comments went to spam bucket.
Did it get fished out?
That’s why I never trusted the climate change/global warming/ice ager goal post movers. They have the same agenda, it’s always been the same. Junk science and outright lies. Same answer: hobble capitalism and control the serfs.
No it is still missing. It was that article on how cheap oil is good for poor people.
Couldn’t find it, Laura. By any chance are you “whole house filter system”?
Well, at least I got Comment of the Year.
And yes, cheap energy is the best weapon there is to fight poverty.
Hmmm. I wonder if this was one of those comments that I started in another window then got interrupted by work and accidentally closed out.
Never mind.
hmmmmm
So, we can meet our energy needs without this pipeline.
Does that mean that the 20,000 jobs that would be created by building his pipeline are superfluous?
We could totally do without mid-east oil if this was built.
Whose ox is being gored?
Follow the money….”
He sure talks gloomy, doesn't he?
We can burn less carbon based fuels if we restrict electricity to the environmentalists. First, they have to be registered…kind of like what they want to do to gun owners. Next they can only have electricity generated by solar and wind and when the wind stops blowing or the sun goes down the electricity stops flowing.
That has to be worth millions of tons of unburnt coal and natural gas. Of course the enviros wouldn’t be able to have reliable cable television, hair dryers, air conditioning and refrigerator thingies. That’s a small price to pay to keep Canadian oil in Canada.
Bunch of woosies wouldn’t last a week with warmer temperatures in July!

"I happen to have an excellent memory, and every evening after we had finished eating, we would... make tea. Pointing to the heaps of books and histories, we would guess on which line of which page in which chapter of which book a certain passage could be found. Success in guessing determined who got to drink his or her tea first. Whenever I got it right, I would raise the teacup, laughing so hard that the tea would spill in my lap, and I would get up, not having been able to drink any of it at all. I would have been glad to grow old in such a world."

Don’t look now, but the Middlesboro Yellow Jackets are closing the season on quite a hot streak.
Wednesday’s 10-8 win at Clay County was Middlesboro’s fifth straight victory and tenth in their last twelve games and the Jackets are now 20-9 on the season.
Coach John Smith said more players taking on leadership roles has been a key to the team being able to sustain their success.
“We pulled some different guys over and talked to them, some guys that had played last year as sophomores. We just told them that they have to step up and be leaders for the team — whether that means being vocal or leading by example,” he said.
“I don’t want to sound like I’m bragging or anything, but we’ve got a really good coaching staff. All of us played college baseball and we’ve got quite a bit of knowledge about the game we’re trying to pass along. The big thing is just getting them to buy into what’s going on. They’re doing that and they’re starting to believe in what we’re telling them.”
The game at Clay was originally scheduled for Thursday, but with a chance of rain in the forecast the teams moved it up a day.
Jake Brock led off the game with a base hit to right and just never quit hitting. He went 4-for-4 with four singles and four stolen bases on the night.
Middlesboro led 6-0 after two innings. The Tigers took advantage of a few errors and rallied to take a 7-6 lead. But Yoakum held his own in a tough environment and the Middlesboro offense came through to pull out the win.
“We jumped on them pretty good and got up 6-0 after two innings and then we kind of relaxed and kicked the ball around a little bit in the third and fourth and they took a 7-6 lead,” Smith said. “Our defense didn’t help him out a whole lot, but Tyler Yoakum threw a heck of a ballgame for us. He went the distance and we wound up winning 10-8.”
Yoakum’s effort continued a string of strong pitching performances by the Jackets. Last Friday he went seven strong in a 6-1 win at Whitley County. Monday it was Lucas Crawford firing a shutout in an 8-0 win at Williamsburg.
One recent change that has paid dividends for Middlesboro is moving junior Jesse Hoskins up to the number two spot in the batting order. Early in the year, Hoskins served as a kind of super utility player for the Jackets. He saw time at second base, shortstop, third and the outfield.
“We had a couple of guys leave the team early in the season that were outfielders. Jesse has played some at second base and filled in at shortstop when Brian (Hale) was pitching. Now he’s pretty much our everyday left fielder and has done a great job out there for us,” Smith said.
The coach added that having Hoskins hit second has been a boost both to him and the entire offense.
“First of all, Tyler (Yoakum) was struggling a bit in the two hole and we talked about what we should do there. Jesse can bunt and do some other things with the bat when Jake gets on base, plus he’s got quite a bit of speed himself. We’ve moved him up there for the last four or five games and it’s worked in our favor.”
Hoskins had four hits as the Jackets swept a double-header against Barbourville and Bell County last Thursday. Brock’s bat has also taken off over the last couple of weeks and Yoakum has taken well to hitting lower in the order.
Middlesboro has won the first three of their four-game road swing to close out the regular season.
“We’ve pitched well. We’ve played good, solid defense for the most part. On offense, we’re just doing a much better job of hitting the ball behind runners,” Smith added.
The Jackets finish up the regular season at North Laurel on Friday. The 52nd District Tournament starts on Monday with Middlesboro taking on host Harlan in the first game at 5:30 p.m.

HARROGATE, Tenn. — The Cumberland Gap Lady Panthers evened their record at 5-5 with a 13-3 win over Claiborne Friday.
Five different Lady Panthers had two hits each and all nine batters had at least one as they pounded out 13 hits in the game.
Oliva Price tripled, singled, reached on an error as she drove in two runs and scored three. McKayla Hamilton drove in three runs with two singles, including a bases-loaded shot to right-center to bring the 10-run rule into effect in the bottom of the fifth.
The Lady Bulldogs jumped out to a quick 3-0 lead as Davidson walked ahead of an RBI double from Ickes in the top of the first. With two down, Williams tripled and Walker reached on an error to push the Claiborne lead to 3-0.
Cumberland Gap’s Danielle Caldwell held the Lady Bulldogs to just two base runners the rest of the way as Williams walked and Walker reached on an error in the fourth inning. Caldwell allowed three runs, two earned, on two hits over five innings while striking out nine and walking two to get the win.
The Lady Panthers rallied to take a 4-3 in their half of the first. McKenzie Miracle led off with a single and stole second. Price reached on an error to put runners at the corners and Kaitlyn McCarty brought Miracle home with a ground out to second. Lindsey Elliott reached on an error as Price scored and with two out, Genna Lake singled, Jordan Thacker walked and Hamilton followed with a two-run single to left.
In the second, Miracle singled and scored on Prices’ triple. McCarty reached on an error as Price scored and Elliott followed with an RBI double to make it 7-3.
Cumberland Gap made it 8-3 in the fourth as McCarty singled and stole second and third. With two out, Lake blooped an RBI single into shallow center.
The Lady Panther put the game away with five runs in the bottom of the fifth. Chelsey Williams started the rally with a double and scored as Miracle reached on an error. Price singled and Miracle scored on the front end of a double-steal to push the lead to 10-3. With one out, Elliott walked and Caldwell singled to bring Price home. Walks to Lake and Thacker forced in another run and Hamilton followed with her walk-off single.
Cumberland Gap (5-5) will play at West Greene on Monday.

Novels
Short stories, poetry, even songs – they’re great to write, and I love doing it. However nothing compares to the joy of writing a long story and sharing an adventure with characters who you get to know so well that they become part of your family. I’ve spent a lot of time working on some writing projects; and know the characters so well that they could be real people. It’s a totally unique experience to write novels in this way. I’ve enjoyed major triumph with character victories, and even shed tears when certain characters have died.
While the original novels I’m working on will not be published here, I will be posting up synopses and extracts to tease your anticipation.
On top of that, though, I have several concepts that I am working through for ‘Webnovels’. These exist in very small chapters – only around a thousand words in length – detailing scene-by-scene storytelling. I’m well aware that reading too many words on a computer screen can be a difficult thing to do, hence offering smaller amounts to read.
The first Webnovel that I have started publishing is a Fan fiction (fanfic) of an older TV show called Dark Angel. This was easily my favourite show when it was on television and remains one of my favourites to this day. In time, the selection will increase.

Just back from a thought-inspiring week's break in the middle Rhine valley - and a reminder of the achievements of Hildegard of Bingen, Field Marshall Blucher and Johannes Gutenberg. Last year I was able to comment on those of Martin Luther and Friedrich Ebert.
Three points for reflection
1. Does Damscheid (beautiful village in the Rhein-Hunsruck-Kreis, population 640) need a Mayor and, if so, what follows from that decision?
2. In entities where the political tradition is of one where what is not permitted is forbidden, how easy is it for open and competitive market economies to emerge?
3. What are the consequences for 21st century Europe of the fact that Germany was Europe's battlefield for so many centuries?
More on these in the coming posts - and the link to the idea of a true union of peoples

Top 10 UltraSuperNew Projects of 2009
This was originally going to be a new year post, but was delayed because of some happy distractions for me personally. So now we have an even better day to release this, the 3rd Anniversay of UltraSuperNew Inc!
Back in January 16, 2007, me and Marc started up USN in some shared office space in Shibuya. 3 years later we have grown to a good sized team working with some great clients and getting more and more opportunities to “do our thing” from our office in Harajuku.
So, as we get kicked off into 2010 and start on a fresh year with many new opportunities and expectations, we have taken a moment to reflect on all that was achieved in 2009 (ie. Year 3) at UltraSuperNew Inc.
On our final day in the office for 2009, we spent a little time discussing our favorite projects for the year and for me, this past year was really something to be proud of. We managed to step it up to the next level this year, and even though some days it seemed like a tornado of different things all demanding attention, we managed to achieve a lot. In the end, keeping the list down to 10 projects was actually very hard, this could have been a much longer list.
So, without further ado, lets get the list going.
1. Missing Wheels (client : Red Bull)
In order to promote the call for entry for the Red Bull Box Cart Race, we bought 70 second hand bicycles, took off parts and placed them around the city with obvious signs that read “We have borrowed your wheel. We needed it to build our box cart for the Red Bull Box Cart Race and will return it to you after the race.”
We managed to create a new type of media with the bicycles, utilizing something that is in plain sight all over the place in busy shopping areas of Tokyo. Even though we had to answer some questions from the police since they were wondering why all these bicycles had no wheels, they found we were behaving completely legally and even complimented us on the idea.
The result was a lot of attention for the race, discussion online and off and in the end we managed to get about three times our goal for the number of entries for the race.
2. Crowdcast (client : Red Bull)
Red Bull Crowdcast is a new platform we developed for Red Bull to get people attending their events more involved with the brand and create a new source of media surrounding events.
Attendees at events can use a simple mobile application to upload photos of the event to a central server. The Red Bull Crowdcast website then publishes the content and provides a combined stream of images in real time back to mobile and PC users at the event or at home, as well as digital screens at the event. When watching in slideshow mode, images can take just a few seconds from submitting to appearing in the slideshow.
The images submitted are more spontaneous than the general material that is collected around events and are published much faster.
We did everything on this project from the concept to the programming to the running of the system, and have many more plans for the next year to take this to the next level in 2010.
3. Pump 20th Anniversary Party (client : Reebok)
We created a 20th anniversary party with a difference for the Reebok Pump at Mado Lounge on the 52nd floor of Roppongi Hills building in central Tokyo.
Apart from the general logistics, branding and planning, we had three key special features for the event that made this one a special one for me. The shoe display, projection screen and dance performance.
Reebok made 20 collaboration models with select specialty sneaker stores around the world, and we needed to display them in an interesting way at the event. The solution in the end was a special vacuum pack that we ended up doing by hand at the office because nobody had machinery the right size to do the sealing of the vacuum. The vacuum packed shoes were then hung on a custom built display. This one took a lot of hard work to execute, but ultimately an incredibly satisfying result that people really took notice of.
For the main space I wanted to make sure we had an interesting way to show the shoes as well, so we designed a special screen in the shape of a shoe silhouette that we then projected images of the 20 collaboration shoes on to. The footage was also programmed on a cycle with sound reactivity and some special tweak controls. The end effect was a floating shoe that pulsed to the beat sitting over the room with a backdrop of Tokyo city lights stretching out below.
Finally for entertainment, in addition to headliner Captain Funk, we had a dance performance by what I term “The ghosts of 1989″. Three guys in neon costume pulling off crazy b-boy dance moves.
We had a packed event and generated a lot of press and buzz around the 20th anniversary. By the end I was so tired from putting everything together I couldn’t even make it to the after party, but slept one of the most satisfied heavy sleeps I ever had.
4. pecha-kucha.org Renewal (client : Pecha Kucha)
This year marked the second major iteration of the Pecha Kucha online platform that we have put together in as many years, and this years version is really pushing towards the big vision. Pecha Kucha is a presentation style and an event format, Pecha Kucha Night, that is now held in over 260 cities globally, and still growing.
We have been involved with Pecha Kucha Night for a few years and have known the founders, Mark Dytham and Astrid Klein, since the beginning back in 2002. In 2009 our goal was to set Pecha Kucha for the expansion that it has already experienced and also what is still to come. The complete overhaul included an extensive redesign and an expansion to allow presentations to be viewed online with its own custom player via the presentations portal. It also saw a formalizing of the special event platform where one off Pecha Kucha events can be tied up with larger conferences or events and the integration of Creative Commons licensing on presentation content.
The new platform was soft-launched in late October, in time for Tokyo Design Week.
5. 100 Years of Life (client : Audi)
For Audi’s 100 year anniversary we put together two short documentaries and an exhibition at the Audi Forum Tokyo.
The documentaries featured two Japanese centenarians. Tateoka-san still plays the koto and we were able to arrange a special reunion for her family where she was able to meet her great grand-daughter (just a few months old) for the first time. 103 year old Shouchi-san still travels Japan and the world lecturing and holding workshops for both adults and children about how to live life well and stimulate your mind at both a young age and when you are in your later years.
For the exhibition we collaborated with photographer, Shouichi Ono, who specializes in photographing 100 year olds, to show the life and strength post 100years.
6. Easytone Pink Bomb (client : Reebok)
In one of our last projects of the year we put together a guerrilla campaign in bustling Ginza with the special pink Christmas edition of Reebok’s toning shoe, Easytone.
We assembled 100 women wearing the bright pink Reebok Easytone and coupled that with some promotional trucks and sample girls giving out present gift cards, all driving people to one of four stores in the area that stocked the shoes.
Even on a cold winter day, we made a lot of people take notice and managed to dominate the area with pink.
7. Pump Atmos Billboard (client : Reebok)
This is a fun, impactful billboard that we put together for the Atmos store in Harajuku for their special 20th Anniversary Reebok Pump collaboration shoe and the anniversary in general.
We wanted to make something a little tactile, so placed a great big three dimensional pump in the middle of the board and added shading on the billboard surface to make it look three dimensional.
8. Audi Live (client : Audi)
We created a live blogging platform for Audi press conferences so that a larger audience of press members could be reached.
The platform consists of a live updating page that is updated by someone at the event and a live video stream. The text portion is also directly updated to the Audi Japan Twitter account. Also on the page is a question form so reporters online can ask questions and receive a real time response, extending the press conference past the duration of the press event.
The innovative use of Twitter made news on TV Tokyo’s Morning Satelite, and featured our own Toyo Yokota.
9. Jetset UK, Claska (client : MINI)
To provide an impactful space for MINI at the Jetset UK event at Claska in Meguro, we created a massive 8m x 3.5m window sticker to make sure MINI put their stamp on this UK themed event.
To execute, we worked with a UK based photographer to get some original scenes from Mayfair (the namesake of one of the new release MINI models) in London, then put together a design utilizing the Union Jack flag and some Minis.
The design managed to dominate the main space of the event, providing a strong thematic element for the event and also present MINI well for attendees.
10. E-City (client : Expedia)
E-Cities was what we term a “passive game” that we launched all the way back in January 2009. The concept of a passive game is that the user just needs to sign up to get their page (their city in this case) and then doesn’t need to do anything other than get people to visit their page in order to play the game.
The more people that visit, the higher the population of your city and the more your city evolves and adds features and buildings. We featured Paris, New York and Honolulu as the key cities that you could grow.
We added some special giveaways as incentives to play the game. Visitors to the cities were rewarded with coupons for discounts on Expedia travel and hotels, while city owners had the chance to win the trip to their favorite city.
BONUS. New Office
Not really counting as a project, but quite significant to us for 2009 was the move to our new office in Harajuku. In our Shibuya office we were bursting at the seams, all in one room, some people even working off the meeting table. We spent more than 6 months on the lookout for new space before finally lucking out and discovering the gem of an office we have now in Harajuku.
Other than space and a great environment to work in, we are treated by working each day surrounded by the key people (young and fashionable) that we spend most of our time creating for. The only thing we have to worry about now is that we don’t fill up this office too
Other things
As I mentioned earlier, we had a lot more projects to be proud of in 2009 that couldn’t fit on the list, and for me personally, this past year of work speaks for the hard work that the whole team at USN has been putting in. As we are approaching our 3rd anniversary of the company, its incredibly satisfying to look back at the progress we have made. Especially in the face of trying times financially for the industry in general, we are very happy to have had our most successful year and have finished on an upswing.
2010 has a lot more in store and we are looking forward to an exciting year ahead.

Congrats on a great year. We are looking forward to following you and your team’s leading creativity and ballsy approach to communications over the coming year.
One tiny suggestion, “impactful” is not an English word and has probably seeped into your vocabulary from previous years as a common AD vocabulary misnomer. Maybe something like memorable, catchy, remarkable, extraordinary might fit?
You’ve continued to raised the bar on what’s possible. I hope to draw on the same spirit for the inspiration of our team as well.
-Jason
Thanks Jason.
On the use of “impactful” … what can I say, language is not static.
For a nice mini essay on the matter ..
Nice projects, I really enjoy Pump Atmos Billboard.
I follow USN for more than 2 years
Hope to meet you when I will be in Japan and why not work with you
Ocelyn.
I guess “impactful” isn’t as made up as it sounds then. My first search attempt before posting led me to the Urban Dictionary, but goes to show we shouldn’t believe everything we read I guess…
Sorry to distract, but couldn’t resist.
Cheers, looking forward to a great 2010!

The Economist
In 1959, the Smithsons were commissioned to design a new headquarters for The Economist magazine in Piccadilly. Inspired by the narrow lanes and courts of the old City of London, they created an elegantly spacious pedestrian plaza as a trio of finely detailed towers, each built on a different scale, clad in traditional Portland stone. The office interiors were based on their lengthy research into the working practices of The Economist journalists. At the opening the editor Sir Geoffrey Crowther said that the staff had felt 'trepidation' on first meeting the Smithsons but took 'leave of them now with awe and affection'. The success of The Economist project secured a commission for the new British Embassy in Brasilia. Alison and Peter produced their design after conducting yet more rigorous research - this time into how the embassy's staff worked. One senior diplomat described their scheme as an 'embassy of great beauty and certainly the most efficient embassy building ever conceived'.

Stephanie – I’m not sure where the animosity is coming from here, but SideReel doesn’t rip video content and pass it off under their own player. They, just like the blogs and news sites that embed episodes for coverage, use the official video player for the show. So pre-roll ads, overlays, product integration and other branding are all coming through in the video embeds just as any YouTube or blip.tv video is. And it’s the creators that make the revenue on those video views, not the sites that embed.
And for the record the creator of the show in question, Sons of Brotherhood, reached out to us last week asking to be considered for the Tubefilter picks on SideReel. While they are also on MMTV, they are not exclusive and were looking to distribute their show broadly. They have asked us to keep the show up on SideReel.
Ultimately I think the key getting web series out there and seen by as many people as possible. And that’s the fundamental advantage of having a player like blip or YouTube or Rev3′s that allow for all of those views to drive real revenues directly to the creator no matter where those views happen.
Mark,
You should take time and read my post and the point of using my BRAND to drive traffic to SideReel.com where I don’t get paid nor do the creators. Unlike some creators, I am web savvy and I do know about content farms and site scrapers.
For the sake of the interested web series creators thinking this will help them, let’s dissect this scientifically: From SideReel’s ABOUT Section on their site: SideReel’s library includes more than 24,000 shows and 530,000 episodes. SideReel also creates and distributes original video recaps, recommendations, news, reviews and gossip for popular TV shows.
SideReel.com visitors spend about 36 seconds on each pageview and a total of six minutes on the site during each visit, and visitors to Sidereel.com view 7.6 unique pages each day on average. (Data from Alexa.com) Of course these are averages but there are over 5 display ads on each page that the visitor goes to to get to the “content to watch” which as one reviewer put about the site as “After they upgraded Sidereel I must say looks better but too complicated for my taste. I have to click a lot to get my damn show to watch. And for Christ sake someone remove the horrible generic sites they put as external links, like tehcake… omg… horrid. Some are good, but most are flooded with dead videos and tons of ads. Shouldn’t there be some quality approach system?”
Your reference to series having the official player drive real revenues to the creator? Really, how many YouTube webseries creators are making money on the prerolls, overlays etc.? Yes, they do on Blip.TV and Rev3 but not YouTube… unless they are a partner. How many are there?
Let’s be clear hereI wrote a post about use of MY BRAND to promote another site that is a scraper site. If you disagree with me, I suggest you ask Matt Cutts from Google what a scraper site is. YOU also told the creator that I said “to take the series down from SideReel” – that is not true. That is between SideReel and the creator.
My point is that you guys are LINK-BAITING my Brand to serve ads to unsuspecting people thinking they are going to seeing “Mingle Media TV” content. I’m not getting paid and YOU and SideReel.com are. You are also making money off of the creator and are not partnering with them to share revenue like MMTVN OR Koldcast does.
It would be really great if Tubefilter supported the sites like MINGLE MEDIA TV who promote and support INDIE creators – you guys don’t mention us or publish any of the info on new shows or news we have sent in the past. So I guess going to a site like SideReel where you know there’s a payday for you as they will get tons of traffic for all the content they have on their site is a better option than supporting the sites like ours who help the community with not only hosting their series, but supporting their efforts in learning the business side of making web series?
You can also see what other creators are saying about Sidereel/Tubefilter/Howcast and other “sites that embed content” here at Web Series Network. It’s not just my opinion – others who have been there didn’t see the benefit that those sites are seeing.
Wow. Lots of information to digest here. Thanks for sharing. As we move forward with Causality, we’ll definitely be careful about where we give permission to display our content. And I hope when it’s all done that Mingle Media will consider adding it to your site, since you are one of the most open and honest sites, and actually support creators.

Lazy.
5% alc./vol.
Available Packages
8 pack 330mL bottles
Tasting Notes
Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale is naturally cloudy and pale in color. The off-white foam slowly disappears to reveal a slight citrus aroma given off by the ale yeast. The citrusy palate gives way to a light malty sweetness with a hint of corn and wheat. A very refreshing and drinkable Ale.
Cheese and Food Pairing
Lazy Mutt will pair well with many foods from fresh garden vegetables to hearty meat dishes and fruits. It will pair well with Swiss, Cheddar, Havarti, Provolone or Muenster cheese as well as fresh cheese curds.
Lazy Mutt is available in many US states as well as AB, SK and MB, Canada.

Police yesterday arrested a third suspect in the murder of lawyer Ahmed Najeeb for allegedly assisting to hide the deceased man’s body.
Police, who have not revealed the name of the suspect, confirmed a 31 year old man had been arrested during their investigations, while claiming further arrests could yet be made concerning the case.
Maafannu Masroora House, the location where Najeeb is believed to have been murdered, is still under observation with a police media official telling local newspaper, Haveeru, that officers are “still trying to find more evidence to support the case.”
Speaking to Minivan News today, Police Spokesperson Sub-Inspector Hassan Haneef confirmed the arrest, though declined to reveal any more information on the suspect’s identity.
“We are now in the investigation process. At the time we do not want to reveal the name of the arrested man as it is a policy of ours to not to reveal the name of a suspect at such an early stage of an investigation,” he said.
Haneef added that officers were presently investigating if any other suspects had involvement in the murder case.
Two suspects already charged over the case, Ahmed Murrath and Fathimath Hana, are currently facing trial.
Case details
Veteran lawyer Najeeb was found dead on July 1. His body was discovered in a dustbin bag in a second floor apartment of Maafanu Masroora house in Male’.
The 65 year-old man’s body was found supposedly gagged, badly beaten and stabbed in the throat.
Police at the time revealed that 29 year old ex-convict Ahmed Murrath had been charged with Najeeb ’s murder and had confessed to killing him, claiming the lawyer attempted to sexually assault his 18 year-old girlfriend Fathimath Hana.
Hana of Rihab house in Shaviyani Goidhoo island, was identified as a second suspect and also faces a charge of murder in relation to the case after she confessed to “helping” her boyfriend kill Najeeb.
During the first hearing of the trial, both suspects testified separately.
Hana noted that Najeeb had arrived to Maafanu Masroora on the night of June 30 at around 10:00pm over, she did not know that the victim had been killed until her boyfriend woke her up and told her about it around 4:00am the following morning. At the time Hana if something was wrong. Hana.
Demand for public execution
During the trial, currently taking place in the Criminal Court, all eight heirs of Najeeb refused to accept blood money and have asked the Judge for qisas (equal retaliation) – the death penalty.
Initially the court summoned the six heirs following the confession of both the suspects implicated in the crime, while the two others were not present for the session.
The court stated that out of the two heirs not present at the hearing, one was living abroad and the court would be making arrangements through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to collect his statement. The other heir was said to work in a resort out of Male’.
In the two seperate hearings held on Thursday (July 5), statements of the two remaining heirs – Shashma Najeeb and Jinaan Ahmed – both refused to accept blood money and asked the Judge for ‘qisas’ similar to the other six family members.
Shashma Najeeb who gave her statement at the Sri Lankan High Commission through a telephone conference, said three times in the court that she wanted the death penalty imposed, asking the presiding judge to implement the death penalty and ensure the killing was carried out in public.
Jinaan Ahmed also followed Shashma Najeeb in demanding the death penalty, refusing to accept blood money.
The Criminal Court Judge has announced that if there are any other heirs remaining which the court has not come to know of, they should inform the court before July 10, and if there remain no further heirs, the trial would be concluded during the next hearing..”
A perceived rise in criminal-related deaths has this week seen growing public debate and media coverage over the issue of implementing capital punishment in the Maldives.

I said it before too there will be more secrets. When you see a murder like this you are not suppose to put the victim on trial in 24 hours ! First you build a case against them, investigate do some detective work and then you go to the court dumb asses !!
chohkaley on Sun, 8th Jul 2012 5:17 PM
We are pleased that a corrupted fellow has left his seat.
Hey Why didn’t Murrath killed Abdulla Gazi – someone has to do something to this junk b”£$%^d – maybe someday this judge also will face a similar fate….
Ahmed on Sun, 8th Jul 2012 5:54 PM
I thought the idea was to sell tickets and kill 2 people inside the centre circle of the fully packed national stadium in front of the cheering Allah Akbar crowd. Why arrest more people. Kill anyone who’s ever committed any crime. Serve blood in coffee shops. Paint the whole country with blood. Celebrate victory.

Open your eyes, keep it simple : we live in a backward country – as too many Muslims all over the world.
We are kept like that by sheikhs and mullahs who pretend to speak on behalf of God himself : nijab, burqa, music too lustful … but some still refuse to see that reality.
genocidal_maniac on Mon, 9th Jul 2012 8:43 AM
please kill the two victims of your society before you find out the truth about it. just shoot their had off, maybe it’ll fulfill your sick f**k bloodlust disguised as shariah law. just kill them and then maybe you can go have a drink in a resort and get some teen girl to have fun with. and the you will come home pray and be harudhanaa.
do it soon! before the truth ruins it for you.

Campaign 2008
President-Elect Barack Obama's victory speech
Chicago (AP) — An estimated 125,000 people gathered on an unusually warm November night to greet President-elect Barack Obama at a delirious victory rally at Grant Park.
After an improbable journey that started for Obama 21 months ago and drew a record-shattering $700 million to his campaign account alone, Obama scored an Electoral College landslide that redrew America's political map.
His name etched in history as America's first black president-elect, Barack Obama turned Wednesday from the jubilation of victory to the sobering challenge of leading a nation worried about economic crisis, two unfinished wars and global uncertainty.

All About Target Field
Twins fans show up early for Opening Dayby Tim Nelson, Minnesota Public Radio,
Sunny Thao, Minnesota Public Radio
Minneapolis — Fans are showing up at Target Field hours ahead of the Minnesota Twins' afternoon home opener to take in the sights, grab a hot dog and snap pictures of the new stadium.
Today's game isn't the first time baseball has been played at Target Field, but it's the first home game for the Twins in the 2010 regular season.
"I'm excited for outdoor baseball, especially this game" against the Boston Red Sox, said Nate Walker, 32, of St. Paul, before heading into the ballpark.
The game against Boston wasn't to start until 3:10 p.m., but downtown Minneapolis was the place to be -- especially as the forecasted rain held off. Street vendors sold hot dogs and State Fair-style food outside, while street musicians entertained fans decked out in red, white and blue.
"It's the most amazing experience," Valerie Crowell, 29, of Cottage Grove, said of attending one of the Twins' exhibition games last weekend.
Crowell, wearing a Twins jersey, said the team's new digs are "awesome."
"I've seen baseball played inside my whole life, and it's great to see it played outside," she said.
Some fans arrived for the game several hours before the gates even opened at Target Field. That included Mike Clark, who was at Target Field as the sun came up Monday morning, well before the gates opened at noon.
Clark lived in the Twin Cities 10 years ago and became a Twins fan before moving to San Jose, Calif.
"Me and my buddy always came to games when I lived here," Clark said. "I moved away in 2003, and as soon as I heard they were opening this park, I knew I'd be here today."
Many fans took pictures at the Hall of Fame area outside the stadium. Others admired the architecture, including the limestone facade that came from Minnesota.
"It's done right," said Nick Capra, 27, of Blaine. "There's a Minnesota flavor to it, from the limestone to the Twins Logo to the State Fair food inside the stadium."
While a Gophers baseball game and Twins exhibition games have been played at Target Field already, the home opener will perhaps be the first true test of everything from transportation and traffic, to food stands inside the stadium.
Twins spokesman Kevin Smith said some things will just take some getting used to at Target Field.
"A lot of our food is kind of made-to-order stuff," Smith said. "Our fans are used to going up and getting stuff that's been precooked and pre-wrapped, and then out they go. But lines are going to be longer in places where we do the made-to-order food."
Metro Transit is also watching to see what happens at the Metrodome light rail station. Staff will be on hand to encourage people to take a bus if trains are too full, spokesman Bob Gibbons said.
"We had a number of fans park there, and then come to the station to ride light rail to Target Field, and those trains were awfully full," Gibbons said. "Our intent on putting staff there is to encourage fans to step right across the street on 4th Street and consider using a route 3, 16 or 50 bus that comes along there."
Right-handed starter Carl Pavano will throw the first regular season pitch at Target Field, and left-hander Jon Lester will take the mound for the Red Sox.
The Twins' series with Boston runs through Thursday. The Twins will then host the Kansas City Royals this weekend and the Cleveland Indians next week.

Online balloting to decide '09 All-Stars
Fewer than two days remain to vote for starting lineups
We, the people, are deciding who goes to the 80th All-Star Game July 14 in St. Louis.
We are ready for the mad rush.
We are entering that Validation Key over and over, submitting our 25 allotted votes in the 2009 All-Star Game Sprint Online Ballot at MLB.com.
We punched those Walt Disney Pictures G-Force All-Star Game paper ballots and left those little chads all over ballparks.
We know there are fewer than two days remaining to decide starters. Our deadline as empowered fans is 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday, and we know that only because we have been staring at this javascript voting app since late April, when those first "VOTE NOW" ads starting appearing everywhere.
We see the excitement building to what could very well be one -- or two, or three -- of the most exciting finishes ever seen in All-Star balloting. Among the 16 starting positions to be awarded, some appear headed toward unpredictable at-the-wire decisions.
We are still trying to decide between Ian Kinsler of the Rangers and Dustin Pedroia of the Red Sox at second base, and at this rate, we won't be surprised -- with Kinsler holding an ultra-slim lead of fewer than 7,000 votes -- if it winds up as the closest finish in All-Star Game voting history.
Both have helped their teams into first place for much of this season. We click the "Compare Stats" link on the ballot, and we see Kinsler on top of the league at this position for homers and steals. We see the reigning AL MVP as elite right now. But we also see this breakout season for Aaron Hill of the Blue Jays and another big year for last year's starter, Robinson Cano of the Yankees.
We are still trying to decide between American League first base rivals Mark Teixeira of the Yankees and Kevin Youkilis of the Red Sox, who have exchanged the lead five times, with Youkilis moving 40,047 votes ahead of Teixeira this week. What those two players do in these final days undoubtedly will make a difference.
We are still trying to decide between Hanley Ramirez and Jimmy Rollins. Florida's superstar came from behind in the latest voting update, going from 87,000 behind the Phillies' shortstop to a 254,257-vote lead.
We still aren't sure about Yadier Molina of the Cardinals or Brian McCann of the Braves. In fact, we aren't completely sure which Molina brother to go with. Lots of people are supporting Bengie Molina of the Giants, but the Cardinals' backstop had been holding the edge for a hometown start.
We hold the power in these final days to change both starting outfields. The latest update had Jason Bay of the Red Sox, Ichiro Suzuki of the Mariners and Josh Hamilton of the Rangers in the AL outfield, but Torii Hunter of the Angels and Carl Crawford of the Rays were well within reach of Hamilton, who has missed the past month due to injury and has seen his lead for the third and final spot narrow to about 145,000.
Raul Ibanez of the Phillies, Braun and Carlos Beltran of the Mets are the latest leaders in the NL outfield, but the voting volume is so enormous that there is an easy chance for upward movement by Alfonso Soriano of the Cubs and Shane Victorino of the Phillies, both of whom are within striking range.
We will be making our own final judgments, and then once again the majority of people will say: "Fans got it right."
We already had recorded 163 million votes online entering this final week of balloting, representing a 15-percent increase over the comparable 2008 vote total. With millions of votes coming over these last days, we will decide which Major Leaguers become the starting position players.
"With fans casting votes on MLB.com at a record pace, we look forward to a historic and exciting conclusion to this year's All-Star balloting for the elected starters," said Dinn Mann, executive vice president, content, MLB.com. "These close races have been fascinating to watch each week and leave us eagerly anticipating the second leg of online balloting when the final roster spot for each All-Star team will be determined exclusively on MLB.com."
We vote because we want fans to get it right. We vote because our favorite players are the best. We vote because we don't like those other guys. We vote because it is fun. We vote because every year we bump someone into a deserved spot right at the end, as we did with Ryan Braun at the end of last year's All-Star balloting, as we did with Albert Pujols and Hideki Matsui years ago. We vote because it is our chance to demolish baseball records.
We are the All-Star Game voters.
We know it's important, and we aren't through yet.
We will vote until we can't vote anymore, and then we will watch as rosters for each league will be unveiled July 5 on the 2009 MLB All-Star Game Selection Show, televised nationally on TBS. The AL and NL teams each will have eight fan-elected starters. Twenty-three reserves for both squads will be determined through a combination of "Player Ballot" choices and selections made by the two All-Star team managers -- Joe Maddon of the Rays and Charlie Manuel of the Phillies -- in conjunction with MLB.
We will see not only who we collectively settled on as the starters, but also just what kind of voting power we reflected again. It is like no other sports digital interactivity. 2008 online balloting, 214.7 million votes from 16.5 million ballots were cast at MLB.com and the club sites, despite having seven fewer days in the voting cycle than in 2007. These record figures each represented increases of nearly 40 percent over the previous marks for total votes and ballots cast.
We know it's not over at that point, either. We get to keep voting after a brief cooldown, because immediately after the announcement of the rosters, phone, exclusive to Sprint subscribers. Both winners will be announced after the voting has concluded on Thursday, July 9.
We don't even stop voting there. During the game itself, we participate in the official voting for the All-Star Game's Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award presented by Chevrolet via the 2009 All-Star Game Sprint MVP Vote on MLB.com. So we not only decide the starters and the final roster spots, but we help decide who is the MVP that night at Busch Stadium.
We heard MLB president and chief operating officer Bob DuPuy say: "The Major League Baseball All-Star Game Balloting program is one of the great traditions in sports and serves as a powerful way to engage baseball fans around the world. Major League Baseball is delighted that fans once again will determine the Midsummer Classic's starting lineups as we celebrate the 80th All-Star Game in one of America's truly special baseball cities."
We believe it. We are living it. We are typing Validation Key after Validation Key. We will pour on the votes in this final week, just as we have done before, and we probably will make a dramatic difference of some kind in the final 24 hours. We have done it before. We are doing it as you are reading this, and now it is time for you to click the ballot as well.
We, the people, are deciding who goes to the All-Star Game.

After hanging this in my daughter's room, I got a picture of her basking happily in the warm green light.
I even got a quick picture of her happy view. She loves it & so do I. The light and shadows cast on the walls are very soothing and serene. Hope you enjoy our happy little butterfly lamp.
The way the lamp lit up kind of reminded me of the jellyfish I saw in Monterrey.

Thanks for sharing it on SNS!
FJ Donna
Wow! That is amazing! Love it!
Thanks for sharing!
~Liz
I love the light/mobile, and thanks for stopping by to answer your thrift questions
How do you decide when to buy? If I am buying for myself, it's it's something that I need or have been searching for. For others, it's at their request
What do you do with it once you have it? Most times than not they are sold
How do you keep things from piling up around your house? It's hard not to, but most times once I have revamped, things I find are sold
Thanks for stopping by. You can see my guest post on thrift tips here
I love this - I'm definitely going to have a go at making one! I made confetti for my wedding with one of those butterfly stamps!
OMG this is SO amazing! That $80 Pottery Barn mobile thingie has got nothing on you!
Corinna
Love it!!!
xoxo,

Wow! This is gorgeous. I want one in my room.
That is really beautiful! And your daughter is so precious!
Hi its really very nice blog i enjoyed a lot to visit..Mobile prices

Losing is fun.. what about playing?
One of my many personal failings is that I’ve never been able to figure out how to play Dwarf Fortress. Remember Cypher staring into The Matrix? Playing Dwarf Fortress is kind of like that, except instead of seeing blonde, brunette, redhead you see dwarf, goblin, carnivorous trout. But every once in a while something comes along that makes me think I should try again, like this great article in The New York Times Magazine: The Brilliance of Dwarf Fortress.
The most amazing part is the dedication of Tarn Adams, the developer. He’s got a doctorate in Math from Stanford, but plans to spend the rest of his life working on his game, which is appreciated by few, but is possibly the most intricate game ever created. He works on the game every day, and pays his basic expenses with the few donations he receives. His living conditions would be considered a nightmare by many, but for some is nirvana: he works from 3PM to 6AM every day, in a room with boarded up windows, living on barely more than just soda, coding and brainstorming game features with his brother, Zach.
Somebody on reddit had this to say about the complexity of DF. In most games, you have hit points. Each time you are hit by a bad guy, your hit point total goes down, and when it reaches zero, you die. Dwarf Fortress is different:
In Dwarf fortress, you have individually modeled bones, internal organs, fingers, toes, facial features, and a circulatory system. And that’s just what we can see; I suspect much more. If bitten by something with paralytic venom, the diaphragm (eventually) stops filling the lungs and the dwarf dies minutes later after blood oxygen levels fall too far.

National Science Foundation Develops a National Super Highway Greg Chartrand 3/11/93
"I just returned from a network meeting in San Diego today and thought you would be interested in my interpretation of what NSF proposes for the National Education and Research Network (NREN). Rather than comment specifically, I decided it would be interesting to write a parody which relates the NREN to the construction of a national super highway. Doing so removes the highly technical aspects of the overall planned functions the NREN. Please excuse this style, but I think its the only way to explain my understanding of their plan in a way that does not immediately get very technical. It may be flawed, but the information is based upon Hans-Werner Braun's presentation.... as I understood it."
The National Science Foundation is in the process of developing plans to build a national super highway that will advance transportation technology in our country. The super highway proposed will replace the existing interstate highway system and allow speeds of at least 240 MPH. the following interview with NSF developers explores their current plans.
*
ME: I understand you are building a new Super national highway(11) to serve the purposes of advancing ground transportation throughout our county.
NSF: Yes we are, as a part of an earlier initiative sponsored by the then Senator Gore. We are very excited about the technology that will allow transportation speeds of 240 MPH(12) across the country. ME: That sounds exciting, how will it be built?
NSF: Well, we will have this super highway designed to allow the high speed travel(13) and it will have six entrance/exit ramps.(14) ME: Ahh.... that doesn't sound like very many ramps, where will they be located?
NSF: Well, several years ago we funded the establishment of six gourmet restaurants(15) scattered across the country, we are going to fund the building of the super highway and access ramps at the restaurant locations. We are however allowing the ramp contractor(16) to build as many ramps as he wishes, at his own expense.
ME: I assume then the contractor for the highway(17) builds ramps where ever it makes sense to optimize access.
NSF: Well, not exactly. We are separating the contracts for the ramps and the highway so the bidders can be very competitive.
ME: I see. How to you plan to connect the rest of the interstate highway system(18) to your super national highway?
NSF: Well actually, its not part of our plan. We are having the highway and access ramps built for us, its up to the states or other government agencies to provide the highways to the access ramps. We will however fund a few temporary roads(19) to connect parts of the existing interstate highway system, but don't intend to make them permanent. Did I forget to mention that we will be shutting down the existing interstate highway system?(20)
ME: You mean I will no longer be able to drive across the existing interstate highway system?
NSF: Yes, it will be destroyed.
ME: OK, lets see If I understand. I have a state highway system for example, and I put in a connecting highway to your super highway, and I can now travel on it, right?
NSF: Well, no you can't. The super highway will only be used for vehicles that can run 240 MPH(21) and we must approve every vehicle, destination, and trip the vehicle takes.(22) We don't want our super highway clogged with vehicles which can only travel 70 MPH!(23)
ME: I'm confused. You mean you want my state for example, to build an access road to a super highway it can't generally use?
NSF: Well, yes and no. You see we also want to encourage development of toll roads in our country.(24) Our six high speed access ramps are wide enough to allow parallel toll roads to be accessed as well as our super highway. Private road builders will be able to put in toll roads between our access ramps, for a fee.
ME: So there will no longer be a "free" interstate highway system?
NSF: Right!
ME: Lets see if I got this straight. You build a national super highway that has six access ramps located where you once established gourmet restaurants and you destroy the interstate highway system. There are no plans to replicate the functionality of the interstate highway systems, but you will allow private toll road builders to use your wide access ramps and develop parallel toll roads to your super highway. My state or the government has to build the roads that lead to the super highway, but once there, cannot travel on it unless the specific vehicle can run at 240 MPH and has specific permission from you to travel on it.
NSF: You've got it!
ME: Well then you must have a very interesting reason to put this highway and the access ramps at these restaurant locations.
NSF: Well, you see, the gourmet food business isn't what it used to be. Fast food has really taken over in our country, we really need to preserve the gourmet food business.(25) High quality restaurants should be located right off of classy high speed highways. We really would like to encourage restaurant patrons to use the super highway so they can have breakfast in San Diego and dinner in Champaign Illinois. We will be looking for patrons who can afford to eat at multiple restaurants and we will let them ride the highway for free! Of course they must have a vehicle that can go 240 MPH.(26)
ME: I'm even more confused. How will I get across the country?
NSF: Well, if your state puts in an access road to one of our access ramps you take it, and then exit-off on to one of the toll roads that will be built parallel to our super highway.
ME: How fast will I be able to go?(27)
NSF: What ever the speed limit is on the toll road.
ME: What will it cost me to ride on it?
NSF: What ever the toll is. You see, we expect that several toll roads will be developed. Competition! It should keep the price down.
ME: When the super highway is empty, how will it be used?
NSF: Well, we are telling the gourmet restaurants that they should work together even though they will be competing with each other for customers.(28) You know, they could develop plans to send trash to each other so they can demonstrate how fast the transportation is on the super highway, it would be in their best interest.(29)
ME: Aren't there plans for development of high speed toll roads already in progress by several toll road builders? What makes you think they will put their roads in-between your access ramps?(30)
NSF: F.O.D.
ME: What?
NSF: Field Of Dreams. If we build it they will come.
ME: So again, tell me who pays for what?
NSF: The government funds the super highway and six access ramps. The toll road providers build their own roads and pays an access fee for the ramps. The states and other government agencies pay for any roads necessary to get to the access ramps. When you get on a toll road and pay what ever the price is.
ME: And the only one's allowed to ride on the super highway are those persons who have special vehicles that can go 240 MPH with your specific permission, or those who can afford to frequent the gourmet restaurants and travel at 240 MPH. Everyone else takes the toll roads.
NSF: Right, but don't forget the trash runs between restaurants!
ME: Oh, how silly of me! Hmmmm. I wonder if this is really what Senator Gore had in mind?

my profile, i've been posting here for 3 years (mostly lurking). So I can't remember all the high lights. :P
In terms of recent threads I've enjoyed, I really liked Neodoxy's thread about Stimulus and the Broken Window Fallacy. Even though the thread was perpetually derailed, I think a lot of good points were raised. The discussion wound up being timely too, considering Hurricane Sandy happened not long afterward.
I also want to reminisce about a lot of good posters that I don't see post any more. Esuric, Lagrange Multiplier, Stranger, Strange Loop, hayekianxyz, laminustacitus, others. Hopefully they'll find their way over to the new forums.
Either way, this forum has been a lot of fun. I actually learned a lot from many of the people here. I will be sad to see it go. C'est la vie.

Re: "OMG anyone remember "poster of the month"? I don't remember why that died"
Because it was essentially a circle jerk motion, given to the 'favourites'.. mostly of a certain forum faction? (Saying that as a recipient).
Re: "the KnightofBAWAA if anyone remembers him."
Legend. Great mod before he was ousted/banned when Danny took over and wanted to change the forum dynamic. Would not relent if you were on the wrong side of the argument and continued to try get by the laws of logic.
Reminiscing Thread...
When posts were longer, more considered and less 'chatty'.
When it seemed like everyone had something considerable to add.
When the conversation/discussion was something new... not something that you could simply refer to a past discussion thread (or 100) about.
When these guys were all around; KnightofBawaa, Jon Irenicus, NirgrahamUK, Inquisitor.. the verifiable A-team.
Also of note: LibertyStudent, Andrew Cain, Krazy Kaju, E. R. Olovetto, Wilderness, Daniel Muffinburg, Graham Wright, Sage, filc and DD5.
As for AJ, Danny and the rest of the 'consequentialist' crowd... my arguments are far more advanced because of those discussions/criticisms leveled at Rothbard, Hoppe etc. Cheers.
As for thread discussions of amusement/worth, I'll offer two; when mr1001nights came to the forums is one, along with the occasional revleft appearance... and the temp Mises forum excursion over to revleft hahah.
I've always sympathized with a lot of Clayton's conspiracy theories and to be honest, I've always believed in a lot of them.
My favorite time on the forums was when I helped do a little revisionist history re: the triangle shirtwaist fire.
Farewell Mises Forum and fellow posters -I shall truly miss the "God" debates.
David Friedman!
^ True! It is very cool that was he was willing to pop in every so often to discuss his work (though it sucks some people were pretty rude to him).
I definately hope he finds his way to the new forum.
One of my fondest memories is of Liberty Student offering a Mises Store gift voucher to the first two posters who wrote a decent critique of a post by Clayton. I won one, and no one else wrote a critique, so Clayton got the other one!
My favorite time on the forum was back when the deontologists and consequentialists were going at it. I was learning so much back then just from lurking and chipping in now and again.
Special thanks to: Liberty Student, ER Olovetto, Andrew Cain, Conza, AJ, nirgrahamUK, Danny Sanchez, Clayton, I. Ryan, Esuric, filc, Sieben, John James, Nielsio, Adam Knott, Autolykos.

Clayton -
I'll just say that before I began actively posting here, I was a lurker.. I'll take the time now, since it's a golden opportunity, to thank him for his contributions to this forum, whether he still reads the posts here or not. Thanks dude. :).
Does anyone remember Democracy for Breakfast?
I don't remember too much about him, but the basic narrative that I remember was that he came here around the same time I did and he went down the whole beginner's track to learning about AE and Libertarianism and he mostly seemed to agree with the views generally held around here even though he was a n00b.
Then I remember him changing his username to Novus Zarathustra and a lot of his material just got odd and rather intelligent. I always thought that was weird, but I might not be recounting the series of events quite properly.
I also enjoyed Sieben's/Snowflake's contributions, even if he was recently banned. He showed up about the time that I did as well.
I don't remember that Neodoxy, but I do remember you recently claiming that you started here with a noob account and then later opened your Neodoxy account becuase you didn't like some of the things your noob account had posted. This is all adding up now.
Marko:Funny you should say that because LStudent went from being a self-proclaimed Rockwellian (which I thought was very clever) to something far more squishy and ill-defined. IIRC by the end he wasn't even a natural rights guy anymore. So clearly there were some principles he moved away from.
This may or may not be true; but from what I can remember, he was pretty strong on his principles and I don't remember seeing any contradiction.
BTW - Prime, you have the best avatar on the forum. :)
@Prime
What is your avatar BTW?
I failed to make Graham's list. Damn.
Neodoxy - Prime's avatar is Bill Murray in Kingpin.
Lol Wheylous. I appreciate your contributions too. Sadly all lists must come to an end! To me you are (or were) like Robin to JJ's Batman (thanks Jargon!). I sense your best posts are still to come - and they won't be on this forum.
By the way, I nominate that What do you look like? thread as the funniest on the forum (shame some of the pics have disappeared though). Anyone got any other nominations?
I agree that that was probably the funniest, but this one was pretty good to. I also like the pokemon thread I recently resurrected.
Anyone remember Vichy Army ?

Too bad Olovetto was banned when Sanchez started modding more.

Re: "Too bad Olovetto was banned when Sanchez started modding more."
So THAT's where he went?!
Should have known. Pathetic.
It's the era when the "Member Issues" group was created. I think Sanchez might have still been posting as Lilburne then. I know one of his bans had to do with him posting a gif file of the Star of David turning into a Swastika. I think everyone else got the irony in that except Sanchez.
Who the heck is "G8R HED"?
He posts occasionally.
I have another one to add: I fondly remember the "Reminiscing thread" - anyone else remember it? Haha, those were the good old days.
I remember when I first encountered Neodoxy on here and he scared the crap out of me by posting a link for me and then saying:
"and remember. I did this just. For. You."
Also, there was that whole "a" and "z" thing with the Peace and Freedom Party. That was quite a hoot.
Why is the forum closing down?

I don't get on here much anymore, very rarely, but I do remember Liberty Student. Once I asked him if the world was indeed round, and he said "No." Very little grey with that guy, and although he was neurotic, I don't know many on this forum that haven't appeared to be at one time or another lol.
Liberty Student was entertaining, and I even followed his blog for about a day once upon a time. BTW What is the new forum? I might join it and become more engaged? When does it go

Installing CrashPlan headless on OpenIndiana using Mac for GUI
I decided that I wasn’t quite ready for the work it was going to take to convert from OpenIndiana to FreeBSD 9.0 so I decided to quickly tackle a CrashPlan Headless install and also set up my Mac to access as the headless server when needed.
OpenIndiana: Installation and Setup
I pretty much followed the installation directions on the Crashplan’s website with a couple tiny modifications.
Download the application from here.
Move the downloaded file to /var/spool/pkg
pfexec mv CrashPlan_2010-03-08_Solaris.tar.gz /var/spool/pkg/
Unpack the archive
pfexec tar -xzvf CrashPlan_2010-03-08_Solaris.tar.gz
Install the package
pfexec /usr/sbin/pkgadd
At this point I diverged a little and made a change to a CrashPlan configuration file: (this tells the service to accept connections on any IP that my server will respond on)
/opt/sfw/crashplan/conf/my.service.xml
I changed the line
serviceHost 127.0.0.1
to
serviceHost 0.0.0.0
then fire up the service
pfexec /opt/sfw/crashplan/bin/CrashPlanEngine start
Mac: GUI Setup
You now need to setup the gui to point to your remote engine. Make sure you’ve installed CrashPlan on your Mac. After you’ve got it installed, open
/Applications/CrashPlan.app/Contents/Resources/Java/conf/ui.properties
and change the line that reads
#serviceHost=127.0.0.1
to
serviceHost={IP_OF_ENGINE}
If all goes well, you should now be able to fire up CrashPlan on your Mac, connect to your headless box, and setup your backups.
Todo
- Create a config for my local box and a config for my headless box
- Write a script that will switch configs depending on which system I want to manage

I am only about 6 months away from my wedding, so if I ever want to share some of the details with you, I better get started! Today I thought I would share some vintage inspired invitations with you. I found these when looking on line for my wedding invitations. The first few are from Fender Skirts, and are actually for a bridal shower, but they are so sweet that I had to show you!
I saw this in a bridal mag. They made the save the dates, invites, favors etc all with this sweet silhouette logo.
This next set is from Zazzles. I could only snag a thumbnail, so I had to blow it up and the quality is horrible- so sorry! They have a tight hold on their graphics! So check out their website to see them in their full glory!
This set was my favorite, and perfectly fit my wedding colors, so we ordered them! We got the custom Save The Date card, Invitation, RSVP Card, and Thank You Notes. Each has a different photo on them from our engagement set (double sided color printing was included, so we used it). It cost a small fortune (darn my expensive tastes), but we love them! We decided it was worth the splurge to get the perfect design. The invitations are your guests first impression of you wedding after all!
We wish we could send you all invitations, but that wouldn't be possible, so at least I can show them to you here!

I am very happy with this review, though when I first read it I was a little disappointed about the rhyming comment. I worked so hard getting that meticulously right with Dr Virginia Lowe
But I came to the conclusion that you can’t please everyone. It is overall, a very good review. And I only just realised that it was in the Highly Recommended section. So there you go!

Opposition Told to Get its Act Together
Says AFP: The NDP offered some cosmetic changes to the country's nominal democracy, but the opposition must unite and formulate propositions of its own if broader change is to occur. The report entitled "Reforming Egypt: In Search of a Strategy", by the International Crisis Group think-tank said the Egyptian opposition is "congenitally weak". It acknowledged the electrifying effect that the new Kefaya (Enough) movement had on political debate in recent months but it also stressed that Kefaya failed to draw the masses and remained locked in a negative agenda, missing the turn from opposition to proposition. Read it all.

As a prospect that is being recruiting by almost every school in the country, Eagle's Landing defensive lineman Isaac Rochell has seen it all.
In fact, he has seen most schools more than once.
Rochell has taken visits to Tennessee, Clemson, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame, and Florida State, but one program he has seen many times is the home state Georgia Bulldogs.
The Rivals100 defender was in Athens this past weekend for UGA's first spring scrimmage, but this trip was a tad different than the rest.
"It was pretty much a day as a player," said Rochell. "I got to do exactly what the players do. I got to go to meetings, and eat the same meals that the players eat. It was a really good visit."
While the four star prospect did get a chance to learn what it was like to be a Georgia player in his visit to the Classic City, not much else was different on this trip.
"I've been there so many times, things were pretty much like they always were," said Rochell. "I like Georgia, and I've said before that I can really see myself there. I know a lot of people there, and I'm from here so I see them all the time."
While Rochell could end up at a variety of different positions at the next level including offensive tackle, defensive end, or defensive tackle, he knows exactly where Georgia plans on putting his talents to use in their 3-4 defense.
"I know they want me at defensive end and some at outside linebacker," said Rochell. "They have told me that already. They want me up front rushing the passer and stuff like that."
Although Rochell is considering schools all over the country at this time, he did acknowledge that distance could play a factor his decision of where to play at the next level.
"I mean, when it comes to distance and it being a factor, I would have to say yes and no," he said. "I'm not worried about getting to far from home or anything, but at the same time, it would be nice to play close to home too. So I'm not sure how big of an impact it will play, but it does matter."
After visiting the Bulldogs over the weekend, Rochell visited Notre Dame on Monday, and has named the Irish his clear leader at this point, and says that he is unsure of when he could make a decision. ...More... To continue reading this article you must be a member. Sign Up Now for a FREE Trial

The Vember Mill is a modern fable about a boy whose rural community is on the brink of economic collapse. When the boy discovers a family of river sprites in the hills near his home, he learns they too are near ruin.
(your hook starts here)
Preston Vatticus hasn't adjusted to the solitude of his stepfather's home in the farmlands of Northern Utah. His only friend is Corvery, a talkative young raven. After hearing a painful scream in the hills, Preston and Corvery meet the Trenchers--mythical folks who dig the river beds and shape the river banks. Lately the Trenchers have grown frightened of the creek water. Animals that drink from it have been changing into monstrous beasts, and an old miller is bent on keeping this a secret.
Meanwhile, the creek water flows downhill to the irrigation ditches of the Cache Valley, where desperate farmers have been selling their land to developers, and the rural culture is growing thin. Preston's stepfather has slipped into hopelessness, and Preston's mother isn't far behind. Preston now faces a dilemma. Righting the wrongs of the Vember Mill may require him to push his stepfather over the breaking-point. But ignoring the plight of the Trenchers could bring an even worse fate.
This isn't a hook it's a description of the plot, sort of. It's missing the antagonist and it's not specific enough to hook me. And "modern fable" is one of those phrases that makes me say no no no. I really hate anything smacking of "fable" becuase it implies stock characters and no plot, but that's just me.

I like the idea quite a bit, but the writing as shown here doesn't support it. Too many ideas, not enough substance. Let readers and reviewers bloviate about the book's Main Ideas and Overriding Themes. As a writer, you need to concentrate on the concrete. Who-What-When-Where-Why and How. It's not your job to tell us What It All Means.
Focus on the people and their lives and conflicts, and let the world build itself out of that. The rest will happen naturally.
I remember reading the beginning of this story (on Evil Editor's blog, I think), and I loved it with a big-time love. It was so moody and evocative. Please hang in there, author! I want to be able to read this novel some day.
My favorite part of the hook is: "Lately the Trenchers have grown frightened of the creek water. Animals that drink from it have been changing into monstrous beasts, and an old miller is bent on keeping this a secret." Being frightened of the water... I find that eerie and disturbing. In a good way, of course. :)
Don't the animals and people drink from the same water?
If it's the water causing the animals to turn into monsters, what is it doing to the people?
I love animals, to be sure, but in this case, I'd be worried first about the people, particularly if I lived there.
Well, maybe the hook needs some work, but at least the story is distinctive enough that I remembered reading the query and first page on Rachel Vater's blog three months ago. So kudos for that.
I actually like this somewhat. At least it's not the typical find-the-killer-because-I'm-dating-satan story.
You had me interested right up until "may require him to push his stepfather over the breaking-point." I don't know what that is, but I probably need to know before I read the book. It's part of knowing what the story is about.
good luck.
Remind me not to go swimming in Bear Lake ever again.
This story caught my attention, but the hook isn't the best it could be.

For 10 years, Project Teams of MIT Sloan MBA students visited the Chinese campuses participating in the MIT-China Management Education Project to teach IMBA students about career-related issues not usually included in their curriculum. In Spring 2008, Project Team was replaced with China Lab, a new stage in collaborative student activity. Working in small IMBA-MBA teams, Chinese and MIT Sloan students form 12 four-person teams for three-month project internships. Each team — two IMBAs, two MIT Sloan MBAs — partners with a Chinese entrepreneurial firm, conducting a consulting project on the firm's greatest challenges. Mid-way through the program, each team spends two weeks on-site at the firm's headquarters, and the IMBAs come to MIT Sloan at the end of April as the project concludes. China Lab thus builds on the G-Lab model by integrating for-credit classroom-based education, faculty mentoring, and real work for real impact. China Lab so far has brought together 104 students and 23 companies, spread throughout the greater Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai regions.

Beyonce Named ’2012 World’s Most Beautiful Woman’
Beyoncé, perhaps you’ve heard of her, has been dubbed “World’s Most Beautiful Woman” by People Magazine.
According to an interview with the mag, Beyoncé is back to her pre-pregnancy weight and feeling great. Shazam! In fact, Beyoncé says that giving birth to her baby, Blue Ivy, has made her feel more beautiful than ever. Beyoncé also allegedly croons one-of-a-kind tunes to her daughter and “loves” changing diapers. That’s possibly a huge load of crap, both figuratively and literally.
We’d love to hear these one-of-kind tunes, and probably will, considering her husband loves releasing titles about the little kid. Possible song titles include ‘Beautiful Crier’, ‘Check on it-The Kid is Crying Again’, ‘If I Were a Boy — This Baby Would Be a Medical Miracle’ and ‘Single Ladies — You’re So Damn Lucky.’

How to Propose Like a Man
Valentine’s Day is coming up and a lot of guys are maybe contemplating asking their lady to marry them. Here’s a quick guide on how not to mess it up.
Know the Answer – We’ve all seen the YouTube videos of the marriage proposal fails, so know what she’s going to say. Before you pop the question, you should have already had some discussions about getting married. If you haven’t had those discussions already, you may want to bring up some of these topics: income sharing, starting a family and where you’ll live, but don’t preface these discussions by saying, “We need to talk.” We hate that. Instead, when you see kids at a store or running around the neighborhood, casually bring it up like, “You ever think about having kids?” If she says yes, then ask, “Have you ever thought about having kids…with…me?” Or if you’re at a wedding, ask her if she has ever thought about what her wedding would be like. If she readily gives you answers, that’s a good sign. If she gets uncomfortable and clams up, then you know she isn’t ready.
Be You – If you try and do a super duper over the top proposal and it’s just not “you”, then she may expect you to be super duper over the top all the time every day.
Buy a Ring You Can Afford – You may want to give her a huge sparkler, but if it’s way more than you can afford, don’t do it. It’s better to get a smaller diamond now and start off your life on the right financial foot, rather than begin your life together in hock to your eyeballs. Give it a few years and after you’re making more money, take the smaller diamond, split it into earrings, or reset it in a pendant and get a bigger diamond ring.
Ask Her Dad First – Regardless of how intimidating he may be, you need to ask him, especially if your girlfriend has a close relationship with her father. You’ll score major brownie points with him and likely your future Mother-in-Law. The only exception to this rule is if she has absolutely no relationship whatsoever with her Dad, then you can skip it, but you may want to check with her mother.
When in Doubt – Go with the small, classy and private. If you know she’s easily embarrassed, don’t go anyplace where you’re going to have an audience. Instead, rent a limo to take her to a nice dinner (maybe the place you went on your first date) then take a walk hand in hand through your favorite city park and pop the question there. Have a bottle of champagne in the cooler of the limo to celebrate the occasion. Or, call her bestie and her sister and tell them what you’re up to and have a few bottles of champagne on hand and after you pop the question in the park, drive around and grab them so they can be a part of the celebration.
These are all very romantic gestures that show you care about her feelings and the people in her life which may just make her a little more likely to say yes.
How did your man propose?

Global Sales Increases for Wal-Mart Help the U.S.
Wal-Mart reported a 1.1% same-store sales gain, at the lower end of its 1% to 2% forecast (see chart above). While results were better than expected at the company's Sam's Clubs, same-store sales at its namesake chain rose just 0.3% amid persistent weakness in apparel and home-related items."
From the report "Globalization and Employment by U.S. Multinationals: A Framework and Facts," by Matthew Slaughter, economist at Dartmouth:
"Wal-Mart supports its international operations at its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, where it employs over 15,000 people. Roughly 1,500 associates in its information systems division are responsible for coordinating the worldwide distribution systems that move Wal-Mart’s products to ten countries around the globe. Before Wal-Mart began to expand overseas in the mid-1990s, most of these 1,500 jobs did not exist."
Bottom Line: Despite somewhat weak same-store sales for Wal-Mart, notice that Net Sales for all Wal-Mart Stores increased by 5.5% in May (see chart above), and note also that international sales for Wal-Mart increased 14.2% in May and 16.4% over the last 17 weeks.
This points another way that globalization helps the American economy - even if U.S. sales are slow, companies like Wal-Mart might be experiencing strong sales overseas, which helps support and expand the 15000 Wal-Mart jobs in Arkansas coordinating an expanding worldwide distribution system to support double-digit sales increases OUTSIDE the U.S.
1 Comments:
"Today there is a rising outcry in the United States against the global engagement of its multinational firms. Gloom and doom forecasts abound of the dire impact foreign expansion will have on the U.S. economy"...
Hmmm, so maybe just maybe if the US wants to stay competitive some of the inane socialist baggage put on American business (thereby increasing the cost of the product or service) by the pandering politicos will have to be removed...
Speaking of pandering politicos remember Halliburton ...

He knew it was gone even before it came out of Jarrod Washburn's hand.
"I called it," said Ramirez, soaked in champagne and water following Friday's 8-6 victory to complete the sweep of Anaheim in the ALDS. "I told [Mike] Timlin that David had not hit a home run in four days and it was time for it. The pitch. Boom! He came through."
Come through Ortiz did, all the way to the American League Championship Series. The big left-handed hitter's game winning two-run home run off Angels starter-turned reliever Washburn came on the first pitch he saw in the 10th inning and propelled the home team into the next round of the playoffs.
The pitch was a slider and it crossed the plate high in the hitting zone. Then it was gone to opposite field in a flash and another memorable moment in Boston Red Sox history had arrived instantly.
"Well, in that situation, let me tell you, I wasn't really thinking about hitting a home run," Ortiz said. "I wanted to have a good at-bat. I wanted to at least get on base. But when you just think about hitting the ball, have good contact with the ball, that's what happens."
The home run sailed a few rows over the wall in left field to set off a chorus of cheers and hugs throughout the 35,547 in attendance at Fenway Park. Pinch-runner Pokey Reese was mobbed at the plate by his teammates as he scored the first run on the home run and when Ortiz jumped on home plate, he disappeared in a sea of red, white and blue.
It was exactly what Ramirez had said it would be, only more.
"I was looking for a pitch in the strike zone," Ortiz said. "They were making good pitches the whole series against me, so I was just trying to lock myself in and see a pitch that I can hit."
Either the Yankees or Twins await the Red Sox in the next round. But immediately after the game, the only thing on the Red Sox's mind was celebration and who could wet who with buckets of water, beer and champagne in a clubhouse that lacked only a slide to be a full-fledged water park .
Ortiz, sporting goggles over his eyes and soaked uniform, could not wipe the smile off his face. He couldn't wipe off all the water that was being thrown on his head, either.
It's hard to blame Ortiz because nobody wearing a Red Sox uniform in that clubhouse wanted to do anything but savor the moment. Family and friends of the team eventually trickled into the clubhouse -- many congratulating Ortiz -- to enjoy the victory with their loved ones.
"David is one of those guys that I couldn't have been happier for anybody in the big leagues," Red Sox first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz said. "For what that man has gone through in the last three or four years, my gosh. The one thing I told him when I hugged him when he crossed that plate was, 'Momma would be proud.' He lost his momma a couple of years ago, and she was a big part of his life and the first thing I thought of when he hit it was, 'Come on momma, blow it out of here.'"
Johnny Damon echoed the sentiments, along the way adding his own brand of comedy to Ortiz's game-winner. Damon, who had earlier in the week affectionately referred to his teammates as "idiots," jokingly said he's not sure if Ortiz can swim if he ever had to, but he's sure his buddy can hit.
And on this night, hitting was all that mattered.
"Our problem on our team is we've got so many guys who are so valuable, but when he came up we knew he was going to have a good at-bat," Damon said. "We didn't know it was going to be that good but we'll take it. He's the man."
Said Red Sox manager Terry Francona, "Literally, I looked at [Kevin] Millar and I said, 'Can he hit a home run here?' It wasn't that far out of my mouth where it seemed like once it left his bat our players knew it was gone before I did."
The Red Sox needed a hero and early on, it appeared to be Bronson Arroyo. The right-hander allowed only two runs on three hits and stymied the Angels offense for six strong innings.
But things changed in the seventh when the Angels tied the game at 6 with a grand slam by Vladimir Guerrero and the bullpen, led by Brendan Donnelly and Frank Rodriguez took over.
Rodriguez went on to complete 2 2/3 effective innings before giving way to Washburn with two outs in the 10th. Ramirez's prediction and the storybook ending for Red Sox fans followed soon after.
"Manny looks over at me and tells me David is going to hit one out," Timlin said. "David does and Manny just looks at me and says 'I told you so.' He did. He really did.").

David W. Free, Editor-in-Chief, C&RL News, & Marketing & Communications Specialist, Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) ; Margaret Smith, Physical Sciences Librarian, New York University
In the current economic climate, libraries of all types have the opportunity to be positioned at the center of their user communities by providing relevant events, services, and opportunities for outreach and creating space for sharing, discussion, and connection.
Free discusses how libraries can apply the models of online community building, customer service, and outreach with free online social tools and tagging to encourage new connections with local communities. Smith discusses using social reference sites such as AskMetafilter, Yahoo! Answers, and AskOnTwitter to allow members of online communities to ask and answer each other’s questions, creating an invaluable archive of community experience and expertise. She highlights implementations of this new social reference model using group blogs, wikis, and other online forums to allow open discussion and resolution of questions from users, library staff, and librarians alike.

They discuss how libraries must rethink their services and go with completely new models in light of ubiquitous computing and connectivity.
Greenwalt discusses the Skokie Public Library’s “going mobile” LSTA grant project to develop a suite of mobile tools, including a mobile website, catalog, text messaging alerts, and mobile reference service.
Clark talks about delivering video and images through optimized websites that work with the next generation of smartphones and mobile devices (iPhone, iPod Touch, BlackBerry Storm, Palm Pre, Google Android). He discusses challenges and advantages of developing mobile sites, the debate between native smartphone apps versus mobile web apps, best practices for mobile web design, and the lessons learned in development processes.
Benzing discusses creating alternative versions of a website for mobile users, utilizing information needs of users from surveys, focus groups, and usability testing.
The last segment of the session focuses on mobile reference, as Sauers and Burns look at the basics of using the Internet on regular cell phones as well as smartphones.

C205 / When Students Go Mobile / 4:15 PM – 5:00 PM
Kristen Yarmey-Tylutki, Digital Services Librarian, The University of Scranton Weinberg Memorial Library; Kristine Ferry, Director of Web Services, UC Irvine Libraries; Lisa Sibert, Electronic Resources Acquisitions Librarian, UC Irvine Libraries; Holly Tomren, Electronic Resources, UC Irvine Libraries
As smartphones become ubiquitous on campus, they are changing and will continue to change the way that students find, access, and use information. As information professionals, academic librarians must quickly adapt their reference services and library instruction to these new means of information usage.
The first presentation looks at the functionality and capabilities of smartphones and how the devices can either help or hinder students’ achievement of the learning outcomes outlined in the ACRL’s Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education.
The second set of presenters addresses the challenges involved in providing library content and services to mobile users. They discuss offering an entire library experience to mobile users, discovery tools available (mobile-friendly OPACs, union catalogs, library webpages and subject guides), best practices for cataloging electronic resources specific to mobile devices, as well as IT issues, collection development trends, licensing issues, and gathering usage statistics.

What would you do with a billion dollars? Pay off debt? Help your family? Buy a hot Lamborghini? Or how about…gasp…give it all away to charity? Stop laughing and keep reading. There’s an actual website devoted to billionaires who want nothing more than to give their cash away in the name of philanthropy and charity. It’s called givingpledge.org. The richest of the rich declare their intention to give the bulk of their money away either during their lifetime or after their death.
They make a public promise on the website along with a letter explaining the reasons behind their decision. On the website you’ll find such recognizable names as George Lucas and Warren Buffett. Lucas states that he wants to devote his movie-making wealth to education, and Buffett says that 99% of his fortune will go to philanthropy. And you thought you were generous.

Bimbo Newton Crosby, RIM is a corpse. If this would have happened five or even three years ago? they may have had a shot. but the ship has done sailed and from the looks of it the final tally will be Apple #1 with Android trading spots with iOS from time to time, so iOS and Android own 1 and 2, and MSFT buying their way into third place but not having a prayer of taking #2 much less the coveted #1 spot.
With mobile there is always a chance of something coming from out of left field, after all who would have thought 6 years ago that Android would suddenly explode, but RIM just doesn't have it.

I agree that what developers (companies, not always individuals) care most about is being able to make a profit on their investment. And on that front iOS wins, because they provide the best app store, and have trained millions of users to pay for software.
This is as distinct from the Android store, which is not as good, and which sells far less software per person.
But a close second (first for many individuals) is how easy it is to write software for the platform. As an extreme example, iOS is very easy to

"....." (Read the entire article)
I wouldn't presume to offer any insights into this terrible reality. I have not served and have never dealt with the horrific realities of war.
Over the weekend, The Man and I watched a movie that dealt with the redeployment of troops from Iraq: Home of the Brave (Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Alba & Fiddy Cent). Granted, this was one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, but the point was well taken. Watching the troops attempting to meld back into their pre-combat lives was painful.

As I know some beta of AJE are sometimes coming here, Imho the followingAI command is wrong
AI.SetAggro = $Theater_Hispania;-95;$Theater_Gallia;-95;$Theater_Italia;150;$Theater_Illyria;50;$Theater_Macedonia_Graecia;50;$Theater_Thracia;100;$Theater_Asia_Minor;750
AI.Setggro doesn’t allow negative values ( unless things have changed of course). It would rather be AI.ChgAggro.
For those interested, there are AI events files. It’s a little more developed than in PON, and should produce a not fully dumb AI. I believe my own way produces a much less scripted AI, now of course, I may be wrong. Only play will tell the truth. To have played with this sort of scripting for SVF 3 years ago, it gives some results without reaching the current state of AI in Fatal Years.Let’s hope I’m wrong!

Read even put into words how much I love her dearly. Her kids Michele and Damien are two of my favorite people on the planet. They are my Maine Family. They’re the first people I call with good news and they have my back when times are tough. So….the bad news. Cathy has breast cancer. She is having a mastectomy. The day she found out she had cancer we all went out for food and drinks. Cathy also has an amazing sense of humor as well. She said, “I’m not going to look at it like I lost a boob, I’m just going to pretend it went on vacation.” Then she proceeded to make jokes about her boob going around the world having a great time. Then she said she wanted to write a book about her boob on vacation. And that gave me this idea. If she thinks her boob is on vacation, then it should send post cards. So I want everyone to go buy a post card from the town you live in and send it to Mama Morris. Write something witty about what her boob did while there mention you and your friends/family and sign it, Love Your Boob. Wil Whalen
Example from one of our mom-stuff moms.
Mamma Morris,
Hello, I am enjoying the sun in St George UT with two cute goofy girls,
Love,
Your Boob
Your Boob
Our wish is for her to receive a TON of these postcards so she can make a scrap book of her Boob On Vacation. You have no idea how much this will mean to her. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO THIS! It will be the best medicine ever! Also, feel free to pay it forward and get a bunch of your friends to do it as well. You have all my gratitude for this! And yes, even if you live here in Maine, still do it. Also, if you feel so inclined, copy the text of this event and email it to 10 friends.
When she receives all her post cards, I’ve going to scan them in my computer front and back and then have a hard back book made for her.

If you want to send me a pic of your post card I will down load them to Facebook (dianne@mom-stuff.com.) I think we can get some serious momentum going for Cathy. I love the idea of lots of us coming together for healing with laughter.
Facebook event address
This is an awesome idea! I'm going to definitely pass the idea around. I'm glad your friend is staying so positive... it's not easy but with friends like you she should be just fine! I'll be praying for her and will definitely be sending a postcard!
Kasey, Thanks for your comment and your support.

Here, after 2 weeks, are the answers to your questions...
Tim Gunn, you met Tim Gunn - OMG. Sorry Dawn, I love you dearly and your blog, but Tim Gunn. Was he nice, how was he dressed?
Here's how the meeting went. A man walked in and people cheered. I said, "Who's the old guy in the suit and why are people cheering for him?"
"It's Tim Gunn!"
blank stare from me and sound of crickets in background
"It's Tim Gunn!
blank stare
"From Project Runway?!"
"Is that a TV thing?"
At this point, I got a dirty look for being clueless and was left standing alone.
Do you know how many the Ford Flex seats?
I believe it seats up to 7. Hmmm, which kid should we leave behind...
Yeah, camping is a pain in the butt! Your kids, however, will be talking about it for years! At least you are done until next summer, right?
You would think, but no, we're planning another trip this fall.
Oh, SOS, What should a large family do for a reunion when some siblings have $$$ and other siblings owe $$?
That's a tough one. You don't want to make it impossible for those, without cash to burn, to attend the reunion. Those with money may not understand why they're stuck having a camp-out reunion. In the end, I think the wise thing to do would be to claim you have no money at all and just stay home. That way, you won't have to camp, or deal with Uncle Mike's storytelling, Aunt Mimi's drinking problem, Cousin Earl's tattooed girlfriend and her parole officer, or Grandpa's Phil's gassy indigestion.
Hmmm..I am confused. You mean you have to pay a fee to register your children at State schools?
Yup. Well, not all states charge registration fees, but IL does.
So, I guess this means you're not considering homeschooling this year?
I consider homeschooling every year when it's 40 below and snowy and I have to get up early to take the kids to school.!!!
When will it end? Ummm, let's see...yesterday Joe yelled out, "Slug Bug!" and hit Austin when we passed a VW Bug, so I'd say they have at least 30 more years to go...
Just wondering, is Clay going to school this year? or does he have another year of pre-school, if he is going to school who is going to entertain Brooklyn?
Clay's going to kindergarten this year hooray! His poor teacher. As far as Brooklyn goes, I think the Little Einsteins, Phineas & Ferb, Elmo, and the Backyardigans will be entertaining her while Clay's gone.
Yes, but was the mohawk given by his brother? i have to know...
Nope, I cut Clay's hair. don't personally like mohawks which is why I'll never cut my hair like that. Clay does, however, and it's his hair so whatever. I cut it. No biggie.
Did you have a margarita? The margarita's at Cheeseburger in Paradise in Downer's Grove were FABULOUS!!!
No, but I did have coconut iced tea! Coconut! Yum! The best flavor on earth!
do you think you'll ever have another child, dawn?
Sure, I will! When chicken have teeth.
Oh, and I almost forgot to ask, did you by chance get to have any cute fireman over???
Not yet, but with Clay in the house, the chance is always there.
What no pictures of the Naked Cowboy??
I know! I guess I'll have to find time to get back to New York!
I hope you don't have an ear infection--the one I had about 3 weeks ago bled and I was MISERABLE, then the antibiotic made me barf. So, thinking good thoughts for you!
Ugh, that stinks, Stephanie! Really! My ear doesn't hurt, but I still can't hear out of it. I'm getting used to it though. It's kinda nice blocking some of the noise out. I'm kinda hoping my right ear will plug up too.
Oh My Gosh, Dawn!! You got to stay at the same place Rosie O'Donnell used to have her guests on her show stay. Did you at least get to do a little bit of quik shopping?!
Umm, I bought a bottle of water. Does that count? Really, these blogging events are usually quick in and quick out with no time for sightseeing or shopping..
I have no idea! I'll look them up..... OK, I'm back. Austin's a Scorpio, Savannah's a Gemini, Jackson's a Leo, Lexington's a Gemini, Clay's a Capricorn, and Brooklyn's an Aquarius.
I'm about to fly with my nine week old. Any advice????
Sedatives. You might want to take one too.
Hey Dawn! I was at Lake Tahoe this past weekend, I happened to stumble across a wooden plate that read "Who are these kids and why are they calling me 'Mom'?!"Do you have any wooden plates of the liking or would at the moment like one for your birthday?
LOVE it! LOL!
Chocolate or mud? [hand prints]
They were chocolate syrup hand prints because Brooklyn lives on ketchup, chocolate milk, and like 4 strands of spaghetti a week.

I know how it is to have your ear all blocked up, although mine never lasted more than a day. I recommend getting your ears candled, the feeling afterwards is sooooo wonderful. If you're like me, however, you may have to go back a week later and have it done again to get rid of the rest of the wax. My husband and I win the contest for the waxiest ears in our family...
To the Punch Buggy Parent:
It may be too late for you since they are already in the routine of hitting each other but when my two boys (now 7&8) were little we made Slug Bug a team sport to see how many we could see in one day. Our record is 87.
And now, my oldest has started spotting Mustangs.
To parents with young kids...start early make it a team sport with points! You'll thank me in the end. :)
Hey Dawn, I can send you a pic of the Naked Cowboy. Got a few from our visit a few years back. My kids were amazed to see him on the streets.
dawn in MI
We nipped the whole "punch bug" thing in the bud when our children were young. We changed it to "hug bug". When the kiddos started getting to wild with their hugs, we started a hug yourself rule. With "hug bug" we also use a everyone gets a hug rule. The cousins used to think our kids were weird, but that's alright. Our kids have one less thing to fight about!.......................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We just moved from AZ to CO, and I could not believe the school fees! My little one went to K in AZ last year, and I paid nothing, and bought no supplies. This year for 1st grade in CO, there were $60 worth of school fees (not a registration fee, but like $10 copying fee, $5 technology fee, $5 library fee, $10 breathing our air fee, etc), and that didn't include $5 for a school directory, $7 to join the PTA, or $25 to pre-order a yearbook, which are all optional, of course. The newcomers PTA tea this morning was optional too, and I opted not to go!
Don't even get me started on the high school fees. I think when all was said and done, I paid about $300 for my freshman to attend a public high school. $125 of that was a sports fee for softball, but still. Whatever happened to everyone guaranteed a free education? I guess at least next year, I'll know to save up for it.
Thank you for clearing up so many burning questions from so many crazy people. This was one of the best blogs I've read anywhere in a really long time.
You are a saint to answer all of these questions...it is funny the stuff that people wonder. Okay, and one more thing...Tim Gunn, he is great, you might like him if you ever get TV time
You have to try these Edy's Coconut popsicles! If you like coconut, you'll love them. Now I have to try to find coconut iced tea!
Oh, sorry, let me clarify--I'm personally not a big fan of mohawks on children, and I've always wondered what kind of parent would do that to a child. Now I know.
Psh the bunch buggy game Hubby and I still play that LMAO.
From SOS "do you think you'll ever have another child, dawn?
Sure, I will! When chicken have teeth."
Sorry Dawn, Chickens do have teeth.
First - I wouldn't have a clue who that guy was either!
Second - I am "Aunt Mimi" and we own a winery - so yeah....nephews tease me about my drinking problem. Have they been talking to you? LOL
Third - it goes from 'slug bugs' to "PT Cruiser Bruiser" and "Striker Bikers" and then TEN points/punches for "HUMMER"
Fourth - Mohawks rock. Their hair - who cares. My mom hates that attitude. She's going to FLIP when I let the 12 year old pierce his ears...
Fifth - that women telling you about chicken's teeth - I'll help you beat her up. ROFLMAO

I had a double ear infection and couldn't hear for over a month. I fell down a flight of stairs and broke my hand because my brain didn't know how to balance without my ears working. Ear infections are dangerous. Be careful.
Oh my gosh, your answer to what Brooklyn lives on cracked me up!
Perhaps that's because I have asked the question once about my own daughter: "Can a person live on just noodles?"
So far the answer is yes.
I have to tell you....the chocolate handprints remind me of something my oldest two did when they were little.
Hubby and I had spent an entire Saturday cleaning the townhome we lived in at the time, as his dad and step-mom were coming out to visit from MI. I scrubbed my kitchen from top to bottom, even cleaning the floors on my hands and knees. The next morning I was awakened to the sound of hubby yelling. Got up, came into the kitchen to see my boys, then almost 4 and 2(now almost 11 and 9) standing in the middle of the floor with both the chocolate AND Strawberry syrup ALLLLLLLLLLLL over the floor. The 2 yr old gave me a huge smile, then lifted the cup he had in his hands(that he'd gotten out of the sink-dirty of course) to his mouth and began drinking the syrupy concoction they'd made. My 4 yr old said "'ook mom! I can spin reeeeal good now!" and proceeded to twirl on the floor. We then set to stripping them both down and hubby bathed them while I re-cleaned the kitchen floor. Upon finishing, I ventured into the bathroom that was right off from the kitchen, only to find pink and brown little-boy handprints all over the bathroom counter, light switch and toilet lid.
It was a great start to the day...lemme tell ya lol.
A suggestion for flying with a 9 month old: buy 2 or 3 of those giant packs of earplugs and hand them out to the passengers around you.

Ah, yes, the great presents we get from our kids when we sleep in! Some moms get breakfast in bed, but the rest of us get much more exciting things! I fell into a pit of despair though when you reminded me we're on vacation. Next week I have to get everyone up and ready for school again. Summer can just not come soon enough! Great pictures. My kids do dog stuff like that too. One decided to strip down to her "fur" and put on the dog's collar and go outside....
What a riot!!! That is so much more fun than listening to hours of whining! Enjoy the break!
that's a good one!!! it's nice to read a funny this early in the morning.
happy new year!
A ha ha ha ha ha....
How can I convince my husband to have more kids?
Very cute pictures! I think a dog would add too much chaos in your household!
Have a safe and happy new year Dawn!
so the beginning of your poast reminded me of a song I used to sing in high school 'the 12 days AFTER christmas'.
The first day after Christmas, my true love and I had a fight.
And so I chopped the pear tree down and burned it just for spite.
Then, with a single cartridge, I shot that blasted partridge,
That French hens to make some chicken soup.
The four calling birds were a big mistake,
For their language was obsence .
The five gold rings were completely fake
And they turned my fingers gree.
The sixth day after Christmas, the six laying geese wouldn't lay:
I gave the whole darn gaggle to the ASPCA.
(spoken) Well, actually I kept one of the drummers(girls)
Well, actually I kept one of the maids a-milking(boys)
And sent them back collect.
I wrote my true love, "We are through, love"
And I said in so many words,
"Furthermore your Christmas gifts were for the birds!"
(echo of "four calling birds, three french hens, two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree."
But yours goes more like this
The first day after Christmas, my kids and I were still at home.
And so Then, I woke up with a gallon of milk left out. Then, with a single slice of cheese, melted on to six different plates, I remembered I love sleeping in.
or something like that....lol enjoy....
You gotta give it to them - they do use their imaginations alot! Too funny. Have a great New Year! Jenn
I'm always happy when summer is here so I don't have to get up. I still get up before the kids though. I taught them how to sleep really late. But by the time summer is over I'm ready to deal with getting them up and out just so I can have more of the day to myself.
Geez ~ I guess it IS all about me. LOL
I find it just to funny that Jax got in on this one too.
Hey at the very least lol they were playing nicely together for that moment.
I am SO loving this. Little Miss keeps insisting she's a cat (our two cats are her brothers), but thankfully she hasn't gotten out her own food and water bowls. I think I need to keep her away from yours if only to avoid the fights between dogs and cats? ;) Love it.
I was going to send the wee ones your way to teach them to sleep in, but it sounds like you're doing what I am -- trying to ignore the noise and get a little extra sleep. Luckily I haven't found any food out. Of course I've not managed to spend more than 10 minutes in bed after they wake up, since they're so happy to see me at home that they come in and snuggle in bed with me. Ohhh the horrors ;)
btw - any word on the new publisher? I was thinking about you and that the other night and have completely forgotten to ask you.
Oh my gosh, my kids like to be dogs too! They have even taken it a step further and set up doggie school in the living room. They practice jumping through hula hoops and crawling under the coffee table. They've even gotten me into the game by scratching my legs until I give them a cookie.
OMG! LOL!!!! My kids do the same exact thing!! That is funny. Thanks for the smile!
My sister was a dog for years. She is now over 40 with 3 little ones of her own. Thanks for bringing back memories.
Well, at least you know that their imagination is well developed. :-)
I am impressed by the cleanliness of your kitchen floor and LOOK at the ribs on that kiddo...he needs more kibble!! :)
My four older kids LOVE to play like they are dogs. This post made me laugh 'till my sides were splitting. My kids thought I was going off my rocker. The cheerio kibble was the funniest thing I have read in a long while.
That's is too funny! Your kids are very creative and imaginative!!
Hey Dawn! I'm starting up a mom blog too! Will you check it out and tell me what you think? You're like my idol!
My kids do this all the time. One is a cat, the other a dog.
LOL! I think you just described a typical morning in the Spaz household!
I agree, though, better to sleep in and clean up mess later. We mom's need as much sleep as we can get.
I had bowls like that once!! Happy New Year!
Ew, who lapped up the water that you stepped in?
I don't allow barking in my house. It's enough having to hear it from the neighbors' dogs. I don't want to hear it from my children! My daughter is WAY too good at sounding like a high-pitched, yappy little dog.
Happy New Year, Dawn and family!
Glenda
My lot are usually Guinea Pigs... AND they make that horrible Guinea Pig noise all day!
At least they don't shed like real dogs!! Hahah.?
(easy link right here: )
Happy New Year and I hope 2010 begins good for you. You deserve it, and I'd love to meet for lunch if you're up for it after school starts up! xoxo
what cute pictures....love your blog..can it really be 2010....So glad I found your blog and look forward to many reads in 2010..Happy New Year..
Next time, turn off the lights and replace the Cheerios with Kibble and Bits.
Your blog keeps getting better and better! Your older articles are not as good as newer ones you have a lot more creativity and originality now keep it up!
Love it :)
The messes aren't funny, but the pictures of them pretending to be dogs are! Hope you were able to find a way to get some rest while they were on break.
Hmm, I am beginning to wonder if two was enough...

I’m happy to tell everyone about a site that I’ve just recently become familiar with - Mom Central. If you haven’t done it yet, I would like to encourage you to check out their site. They’ve got information and articles on everything from relationship advice to vacation tips to great giveaways. Personally, I can never have too many resources available to me.
I don’t know about the rest of you Canadian moms, but I’m always frustrated when I find great online offers and then discover that they’re “Valid only in the U.S.” BAH!!! The best news about Mom Central for me is that they’ve come to Canada. YAY!
Right now they’re looking for Canadian moms to join the Mom Central Testing Panel. This is a great opportunity for us moms to give our opinions on various products. I don’t know about any of you, but I’ve got more than enough opinions to share.
heh.
Even better is that by signing up during the month of June, you’ll be entered to win one of five Canon Cameras. Free stuff makes me so happy…
So spread the word to all those Canadian moms that you know! Register for the Canadian Mom Central Testing Panel for a chance to win cool stuff AND have your opinions heard. It’s win-win, wouldn’t you say?
Be sure to check out their site –
Filed under: family, mom stuff Tagged: | Canada, family
Thanks, I’ll check them out.
Thanks for the link to their panel – I just signed up! I agree – too often us Canadian gals are excluded, so I’m more than happy to jump on board.
O Canada! International blogging is quite something, eh?
Cool that you found that site.

This is my girls and I in front of the White House.
We sat on the Capital lawn for the fireworks. This was our view; so gorgeous.
The girls in front of part of the FDR Memorial. It was 105 and horrible humidity. We were ready to come home.
The last morning at the hotel. Very tired, very hot and ready to leave.
My girls in front of the United States Marine Corps Memorial--Iwo Jima. Very impressive memorial.
The girls at the Lincoln Memorial.
This is me giving a dinosaur a drink at King's Dominion Theme Park.
This is only six of the almost 400 pictures I took. We had a lot of fun, but we are glad to be home. I will resume posting reviews later this week! Hope you all have a great week!
You and your two daughters looks great! I am sure you really enjoyed the vacation. I am glad you posted some photos you took. I am looking forward to your next posts.

40 monarchs sighted in a 9 hour butterfly count July 19 and despite the fact that 75% of Iowa's landscape is covered with herbicide treated BT corn and herbicide treated soybeans.
Subject: [IOWA-INSECTS] Iowa City Butterfly Count
Date: Tues, 21 Jul 2009 20:58:15 -0500
From: Chris Edwards <credwards@AOL.COM>
To: IOWA-INSECTS@LIST.UIOWA.EDU
We held our local Iowa City Butterfly Count on Sunday July 19, visiting Kent Park, Macbride Nature-Recreation Area, and Lake Macbride State Park. In 9 hours we tallied 25 species and 379 individuals. This is well below the 11-year average of 33 species and 800 individuals, probably due to the cool,
cloudy weather. We had a great turnout of 13 enthusiastic counters, including an amazing 6-year-old who ran around chasing and identifying butterflies all day, and who found two species that we might have otherwise missed!
Black Swallowtail 4
Eastern Tiger Swallowtail 1
Cabbage White 51
Clouded Sulphur 19
Orange Sulphur 31
Bronze Copper 1
Banded Hairstreak 2 (new count species)
Eastern Tailed-Blue 3
'Summer' Spring Azure 79
Great Spangled Fritillary 25
Pearl Crescent 22 (record high count)

Mortgage application denied?!? Those three little words can invoke panic and anger. Why didn’t I meet the lender’s requirements? This question may pop into your head, but in the wake of tighter lending requirements, many applicants are finding themselves on the wrong side of the fence. To get through the process with ease, understand factors that can get your mortgage application denied.
1. Can’t Back up Income
You may earn enough monthly to pay your mortgage and other bills, but if you can’t document this income, expect to have your mortgage application denied. Mortgage approvals are harder for self-employed people who don’t receive a paycheck from an employer. Keep accurate financial records and document all your income. Be prepared to provide the lender with tax returns from the past two years.

The Mayo Clinic started the Center for Social Media in July 2010, unofficially becoming the global." The book not only encourages members of the health care community to join social media, but also presents arguments for social media's importance in the rapidly evolving world of modern medicine.
Mayo Clinic also uses Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and even Second Life to connect with patients. Strict regulations limit the detail in which Mayo Clinic can answer patient questions, but scheduled Twitter chats offer a way to provide general medical advice, as does Mayo Clinic's weekly radio program. Mayo Clinic's YouTube channel, with videos ranging from information on sports injuries to surgery prep suggestions, has more than 8.3 million views.

Welcome to our Adventurist Webpage, to see our official team page, head over to
We are team of young antipodean thrusters who have an unhealthy fascination with all things related to tweed, tea and adventure (essentially we aspire to be more British than the Indians).
We are competing in the Mongol Rally 2012, a motor-vehicle rally organised by a group of eccentric young Britons who call themselves “The Adventurists” [].
The premise of this rally is to drive a highly unsuitable car, in the name of charity, from London, UK, to Ulan Bator, Mongolia (approximately 10,000 Miles, dependant on the particular route taken). And by “highly unsuitable car”, we mean something with an engine capacity of less of than 1.2 Litres (think Nissan Micra or Toyota Yaris).
Our Charity of Choice is Legacy [] and we are aiming to raise at least $15’000AUD.
Follow our exploits here, as we cram four rather large chaps, in a highly unsuitable car and ferry ourselves from London to Ulaanbaatar and if you would like to donate, please do here:
Well some bad luck, all the Russian and Eastern European Maps were stolen with Erics bag in Stockholm...time to replan the route! Good News is the Tweed Suit survived the ordeal!
Approaching 3K in fundraising for Legacy, if you haven't donated yet, the time is now!
First of the 4 Tweed suits purchased!
Tack sa mycket Bjorn och Gunilla! and thanks to Nick and Fi (though you could have dedicated to Eric!)
Maps of Russia and the stans purchased, however it would appear that Eric being able to quote "The Hunt for the Red October" verbatim and some other members of the team having long histories with Russian Working Girls does not directly translate into them being able to read a map in russian
Cheers Topper for the donation and taking us over the $2K mark!
Off to London this weekend to buy some maps of the former Soviet Union....make sure you donate to Legacy in my absence!
Cheers Eamon for the generous donation!
Thanks Kate (Findette) for the donation(s)!
Thanks for Supporting such a Great Cause!

While word trickled out last week that Mitt Romney was set to announce a $100 million fundraising month in June, official word came out Monday: he and the RNC actually raised $106.1 million in June for his election.
The Obama campaign, in turn, announced they and the Democratic Party pulled in $71 million, the second month in a row they were outraised by their Republican rival.
"It was our best month of this election so far," Obama campaign Chief Operating Officer Ann Marie Habershaw wrote in an email to donors.
"But we still got beat -- and not by a little bit," she continued.
Romney campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul said in a statement Monday, "This month's fundraising is a statement from voters that they want a change of direction in Washington."
"In the months to come, these resources will be crucial to highlighting the difference between President Obama's broken promises and Mitt Romney's plan to get America on the right track again," Saul said.
The Romney campaign says it and its joint RNC committee had at least $160 million in the bank as of June 30. The Obama campaign didn't say how much they and the joint DNC committee have on hand, however, at the end of May, they had $147 million.
For months, the Obama campaign has said they'd be outspent by Romney and the Republicans, pointing specifically to "super PACs", which can raise unlimited amounts of money independent of the campaigns. Republican-leaning "super PACs" have raised millions more than Democratic-backed "super PACs" this cycle.
"If we lose this election, it will be because we didn't close the gap enough when we had the chance," Obama campaign COO Habershaw's email added.
Romney held at least one fundraiser on at least 18 out of the 30 days in June. This does not include the three-day retreat with major donors in Utah because according to campaign officials, that was not an actual fundraiser. We do not know the exact number of fundraisers he held because the campaign does not always alert the press when he's holding a fundraiser.
The locations of his fundraisers were spread out: California, Oregon, Washington State, Texas, Missouri, Utah, Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Arizona, Virginia, New York, New Jersey and Washington, D.C.
In comparison, Mr. Obama attended 33 fundraisers in June, the most of any month since filing for re-election in April 2011.

Social.
When faced with adversity my method of coping is mobilization. What can I do to regain a sense of control? This week we are all left to ponder this question. How can we channel our heartache and anger into action? Is it because Newtown is so close to home that we are compelled to act? I don’t think so – the country is engaged in discussion like never before.
There are many questions, and many facets to consider. But two areas scream for attention: how our society deals with mental illness and guns.
Mental Illness:
We face a mental health crisis in this country. Budgets are cut, and with the loss of funding go vital services. There is a disparity between the way insurance companies view general healthcare and behavioral health services; this allows payers to limit services for those seeking help for a mental illness. They impose limits on how much providers can be reimbursed too, so in in this part of the country most therapists don’t accept any insurance. People who have a mental illness are stigmatized, and this deters many from accessing services. Parents who seek help for their troubled children are chastised if medication is part of the treatment.
There are no easy answers. Let’s talk, listen and learn from each other. We need to take a close look at how our society deals with people who have a disease of the brain – a chemical imbalance. It will take work, but we can change the culture, and improve the care of those experiencing a mental illness.
Leadership from the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI) Connecticut is going “on the road” to talk with residents throughout the state. This is an opportunity for community members to learn about what is happening in Connecticut to address the needs of those with mental illness, and to get involved on a grass roots level. Local NAMI chapters will host the meetings; a schedule can be found on NAMI CT’s calendar. Some dates are already scheduled (below), and more will be:
- Fairfield NAMI: January 2, 2013, 7:30-9:00 pm. This meeting’s agenda includes a discussion of NAMI’s legislative priorities for 2013. More about the meeting is here.
- Stamford/Greenwich NAMI: January 16, 2013. More info here.
- NAMI Southeast (Norwich): February 6, 2013. More info here.
- NAMI Windsor Locks (East Windsor): February 10, 2013. More info here.
Guns:
Let’s consider the facts. The Swiss-based Small Arms Survey found that in 2007 the United States had the highest gun ownership rate in the world: 88 guns per 100 people, or 270 million altogether.[i] When countries experiencing high murder rates by drug cartels (Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil) were excluded, the survey reported that the US has the highest rate of homicide by guns. Firearms killed 31,347 people in 2009 – that is 17.7% of all injury deaths that year.[ii]
Gun control helps. The states with high gun ownership and weak gun laws experienced the most gun deaths.[iii] No matter how “gun enthusiasts” may spin it, the numbers speak for themselves: tougher gun laws save lives.
What justification is there for civilians to own military style weapons and high capacity magazines? What rational person would deny the importance of background checks and gun registration? When Congress resumes session in January, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) intends to introduce a bill to renew the ban on assault weapons. These are common sense measures.
The gun lobby is powerful. Suggestions to arm teachers and implement high-tech security features in our schools and public areas are based on the premise that the current state of gun ownership and (lack of) regulation is acceptable. No longer can our society acquiesce to gun violence perpetrated against the innocent. This is our call to be part of the solution. The nation is ready – now is the time for action.
Contact government officials:
Let your elected leaders know what you think. Connecticut Against Gun Violence,, is leading the charge on gun control in the state. They are working with Connecticut legislators and on January 9th a Bill will be introduced to enhance gun safety. Click on the “Legislative Action Center” on the right side of their home page, under Take Action. Once you enter your home address this link will connect you to your local, state and federal representatives in government. Since Senator-elect Chris Murphy hasn’t taken office yet, he is not included. He can be reached here, at his Congressional office. After he takes his senatorial seat that link will close and he will be listed on the CAGV’s Legislative Action Center too.
Other organizations that are actively pursuing gun control:
- The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence,
- Mayors Against Illegal Guns,
- Coalition to Stop Gun Violence,
- Violence Policy Center,
Several on-line petitions are circulating:
- Immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress. We the People: sign the petition
- Gun Control. Now. Sign On (an arm of Move On): sign the petition
- Increase the availability of mental health services now! Change.org: sign the petition
- Zichronam Lirracha: For their memory shall be a blessing. Jewish Council for Public Affairs: sign the petition

Reserva Natural La Cordillera, comprised of Icacos, Diablo, Palomino, and Palominitos, is a protected string of small sandy islands just north and east of Fajardo [1] with lots of great snorkeling and diving spots around them. Bring plenty of water and sunscreen—there are no facilities or stores on the islands.
To get to Reserva Natural La Cordillera, go to the dock in Las Croabas and arrange a ride with one of the boat operators there. They’ll drop you off and return later to pick you up. The cost is typically $10 each way. The islands can get crowded on weekends and holidays.

Last week I found out that my quilt would be featured on the cover of McCall's Quilting!!!
It's the large star made from a jelly roll of Kate Spain's Flurry. I just love it!
They named it Snow-Kissed Star which is more perfect than anything I could have come up with!
Here's the link to their blog:
and here's the link to more information about the pattern on their website:
The pattern takes half of a jelly roll. That means I have half a jelly roll in my sewing room. To celebrate, I have decided to give it away!
If you want the jelly roll, leave a comment telling me what your favorite Christmas color combination is for a quilt. Do you like traditional red and green, bright red and green, do you like adding the winter blue, magenta and forest green? I think I will do the drawing on Monday. Monday sounds like a good day to have a prize drawing.
**The drawing is now closed.**
Happy Quilting!

Congratulations. It is gorgeous
I like red and green with a little gold thrown in for Christmas quilts. But lately I have been drawn to the dark side. Since I have been using Countdown to Christmas by Moda, I have come to love a little touch of black added in to the mix.
Wow - congrats - that is really cool!
I really like the Christmas brights.
Congratulations on becoming a Cover Girl quilt designer! Thanks so much for the generous offer. I hope I win! My favorite color is red.

Congrats on being a COVER GIRL! For Christmas I prefer the brighter reds and greens with some minty blue thrown in for good measure.
That is beautiful.
Congratulations, cover girl! I like Red, Green, White with a little Black as an accent. It really makes it pop.
Just got this magazine in the mail. Love bright reds and greens! I love this pattern, can't wait to make it, but I have a few UFOs to finish first. :)
Thanks for the chance to win!
congrats! it is a beautiful quilt.
I love reds/golds for Christmas. last year I tossed some brown into the mix and loved it.
So winter looking! I love it! I tend towards the richer deep reds, golds, greens and blues for Christmas sewing, but I love looking at all the modern bright cheerful fun prints that are out there now. So if I win this half jelly roll, I would be able to make your star pattern! How exciting! I'll have to be on the lookout for it.
MGM
The last few years, my favorite colors have been blue & green. In past years, it's been blue & white & silver. So I switch back & forth. Thanks for the giveaway.
Congratulations on the magazine cover! I have it and was impressed with the quilt. I am thinking I am gonna change up the usual Christmas colors and go with aqua and red with some cream and black for balance. I tried it a little last year and was pleasantly surprised but I used a Christmas style pattern with what looked like peppermint kisses and I think that is what helped it say Christmas..
My favorite colours this year are blue White and silver!! But traditional is always good
Red and Green is it unless it involves a cut snowman and then the blues
Congratulations, I'll be looking for it! Beautiful quilt.
CONGRATS TO YOU!
YOUR TABLE TOPPER IS BEAUTIFUL!
I USUALLY LIKE JUST THE RED/GREEN TRADITIONAL COLORS,BUT YOURS IS SO DARLING THAT I THINK I WANT TO ADD AQUA TOO!YOU ARE SPECIAL TO GIVE IT AWAY! THANK YOU♥
jldouglas@wispwest.net
Congratulations, your quilt is really an original. I love blue, white, and silver but deep reds and greens feel so homey and warm.
I might have to break my no-buy budget to pick up the magazine - I just love that! It's stunning and Kate's fabrics just top it off.
I love rich emerald green with burgundy red and a little blue thrown in!
I love the traditional colors best - red, green, gold. But I absolutely adore Kate Spain fabric. Loved her 12 days of Christmas line - which had a non-traditional color. would love to work with some somthing outside my comfort zone.
Congratulations! I love your quilt! I like the traditional red and green
Congrats! Being on front of a McCalls Quilt cover is an awesome accomplishment. Be prepared for all the new followers!
I like cute prints like Flury or something like that in jelly roll Christmas quilts. I'm not that great in putting colors together myself just yet, but I'm gettin gthere. Thanks for the giveaway!
For Christmas colors, I like a variety of reds, greens, winter blues, and creams. Not bright reds and greens, but more medium tones. Love your quilt!
Congratulations Konda!
Whilst my Christmas decorating started out in traditional colours of red, greeen and gold, they have branched out to include blue, silver, hot pink (yikes) and lime green (even more yikes). But it kinda works, from a distance!
How exciting. Love the pattern and the fabric. I would love to win.
Congratulations and thanks for the giveaway chance! I love Kate Spain's Christmas lines with the aqua thrown in with the red and green!
It depends which room I'm decorating, but like most of the color combinations you mentioned. If I were lucky enough to win the half jelly roll, I'd make a matching quilt to yours!
I love the red and green but I feel a need to toss in some blue too and maybe some tan.
I love, love winter blue(s) with a bit of silver and green and definitely some dark red.
I love red and green but in a print that can be played off as an everyday quilt that reminds you of Christmas. Congratulations on the cover! It is beautiful. :)
My favourite Christmas Combo is of course the red and green with gold also tossed into the mix! Congratulations...your quilt is gorgeous!!
Paulette
Red and white. Love the star quilt.
Green and gold. I like the idea of throwing in a bit of black for spice.
I guess I am a traditionalist as I really like red and green with white for Christmas. I have added a lot of blue into the mix but mostly I like the traditional colors. I would love to get your jelly roll: I would make your quilt for us.
Congrats! I love the festive look to this quilt. I am definitely going to pick up this issue.
It looks like such a fun quilt! Certainly draws attention because it is not "normal"! I prefer darker greens and reds:-)
I'd have to say that the traditional red and green are still my favourites, but I am liking a lot of the new Christmas fabric lines that are coming out this year.
(supermomnocape at yahoo dot com)
Thanks for this fun giveaway.
Congrats! Very pretty quilt! I love reds, greens, silvers, blues, non traditional tones. Thanks for the chance to win!
I like white blue and silver.
That is a beautiful guilt.
I like Kate Spain's last 2 Christmas lines. I like to add that light blue and change up some of the patterns. So, you could actually keep the quilt out past Christmas if you wanted to.
I love Christmas brights. Congrats on the mag cover.
I like a muted red and green, with a little yellow thrown in. Kathie L in Allentown
I love it all. Bring it on.
Congratulations on the magazine cover!! Good work & the star is beautiful!
I'm a traditional green & red although I have been venturing out into the blues/whites/silver colours.
Gorgeous quilt! I love traditional colors for Christmas - brick reds, forest greens, with splashes of white and gold.
I am so traditional...gotta love the red and green. But this latest trend to use lighter greens, blues and pinks really has me excited! I love your strip star..love it.
Very exciting!! Congratulations:)
WOW! Cover girl is cool! Congratulations to you. How fun that must be to see the magazine with your quilt on the front. :)
I am a total Christmas freak and love to decorate many trees in different colors and themes. I don't really have a favorite colorway but I do know that this year I will be adding more of the blues and reds together.
Thank you for the chance, and your quilt is exquisite! :)
reds with greens unless...it is a snow scene and then I love the blues
Beautiful quilt and Congrats on the publication!
I am into traditional holiday colors although I always think I'm going to change it up but never do! lol Can't go wrong with the classics, right :)
First, I love that quilt! It is gorgeous!
I love to splash a little bright pink in with my bright Christmas greens and reds.
If I am doing more jewel tones, Silver, Burgundy and Forest green.
That quilt is beautiful! :) I like red/gold or blue/silver/white combos-the blue combo probably because we very rarely get snow down in my part of Texas!
Congratulations -- what an honor to be on the cover of McCall's. For our first Christmas in our new home last year, I switched to an Aqua color theme, and I just love the way it looked! Can't wait to get those decorations out this year!
I subscribe to McCall's and love, love your pattern. (I had already marked it with a post-it note). Please pick me, because I would love to totally copy cat your pattern!
I love red and green, but I could also go for a light blue and white! :)
Although I like the blue snowmen and frosted blue christmas ornaments, I'm such a traditionalist that it really doesn't feel christmasy to me unless it has the red and green. You quilt is darling. I would love those colors. Thanks.
I am traditional with deep red and green. LOVELY quilt!
Congratulations! A gorgeous quilt!
I love red and green - but not metallic fabrics!
Congratulations on your magazine cover! It's a fabulous quilt. I love burgundy, cream and dark green for the holidays right now.
I like using reds and greens
Congrats on the cover-the quilt looks wonderful.
First of all, congratulations on the magazine cover! What a thrill it must be for you!! :)
I think that I really like the traditional red and green, with some black/white/silver thrown in.
Thanks for the giveaway!!
Congratulations. I love the fabric you used. cant wait to receive my maz.
I got the magazine yesterday and immediately LOVED this quilt...Congratulations...! ps...I'd love the other half of the jelly roll!
Bev/Mo
Congratulations, Konda! It's beautiful! Can't wait to get my issue!!
I am a tradional red and green girl. I have tried other combos but always go back to this.
I love Christmas decorations. My fav is red and green but like all combinations of Christmas colors.
bgk44 @msn.com
AWESOME!!! That is a beautiful quilt. Makes me want to go buy a jelly-roll! :o) CONGRATS!
Love your quilt..Great colors and I am looking forward to making one also..and awaiting the drawing as I haven't picked up that jelly roll yet!
Congratulations on the cover, just got it today!!! Have been poring over it. Love the quilt and is going on my to do list...but not for this year. I love more of the muted and jewel tone reds and greens but always mange to throw a little surprise in, sometimes gold, sometimes black. Keeps it interesting!
Congratulations on being a Cover Girl! It's a beautiful quilt. I love the Flurry line of fabric, too.
Congratulations! That's a beautiful Christmas quilt. I like traditional Christmas red and green, but that blue in your quilt is something I'm going to have to try.
I like some blue added into the traditional Christmas colors. Thanks for the giveaway....I have the magazine here just waiting for that half jelly roll.
Love the quilt, what a wonderful way to make a big star! Every year for Christmas I decorate the tree differently. Usually it has blue and silver, because I love snowmen and snowflakes, and most of those ornaments are blue and/or silver.
WOW!!! So cool to be in a magazine!
I'm more a traditional girl when it comes to Christmas colors.. True red and green. That being said, I sure do love pretty much all the Christmas lines this year.
I just got my copy in the mail and within the hour purchased the fabric and linked to your blog on my Google Reader! What a wonderful pattern - congrats on being a cover girl and I'm so happy to have found your blog :)
Congrats on being a cover girl - your quilt is gorgeous !!
Congratulations, I love the Reds, Greens, Whites and Blues for Christmas.
How exciting! It is beautiful. I like any combo of red and green for Christmas.
Congratulations! I like traditional red and green, and white. Thanks for the giveaway!
I like nontraditional colors, like white, turquoise, red, gold, silver, anything with pizzazz!
Oh, I have that magazine and have been admiring your star all weekend. Great job. If I am not too late I would love to be entered in the give away. My fav Christmas combo is the traditional Christmas red and green with a touch of gold.
Am I to late to enter. Such a beautiful quilt. Heading out to get the magazine now.
Thanks

Flats and Handwashing Challenge and I'm definitely feeling the flat love. Only one leak yesterday, but I was really pushing the diapers to the limit so I think that was pretty awesome. I was even able to use one small, thin, Child of Mine flat all by itself with no leaks with a kite fold (though it was SOAKED under the cover). Very impressive.
I am also loving the camp washer. Makes things very easy and looks like it works very well. I say "looks like" because I only did half of a wash cycle last night. I filled the bucket with cold water and agitated them a bit for a pre-rinse, then filled the bucket with hot water and detergent and agitated some more. Then I got distracted and left them in the hot soapy water overnight. I'm thinking that won't hurt and may help, and I'm up to rinse and hang them before the kids get up. I was wiping and reusing my covers yesterday so I only ended up needing three all day. I also had plenty of diapers left over, so I'll be fine today while waiting for the rest of the stuff to dry.
I had planned on just participating in the flats challenge with my diapered baby, but it occurred to me that it would kind of be cheating to then go and put a pull up on my four year old at bedtime. So back to Walmart I went. They didn't have any Child of Mine covers in a 5T so I went with the flannel and fleece from the craft department. I didn't get home until bedtime so I just tied the flannel and fleece on Violet all crazy like and I'll cut some real flats and covers today.
Speaking of homemade fabulousness, today we have a special treat with guest blogger Monica Weller. Without further ado, take it away Monica!
I'm so excited to share with you about making homemade laundry detergent. I have been making my own laundry detergent for well over a year now and I use it exclusively. I'm especially thankful to have homemade laundry detergent for my cloth diapers.
We have a large family and I try to save money any chance I get. I wasn't sure if making laundry detergent would work for us or not but I figured I didn't have much to lose if it didn't work and if it did work doing this could potentially save our family some considerable dollars.
Well it worked and I am not going back. We have a septic system so I make liquid detergent but you can make a powder version if you prefer. This is the recipe I use:
1/3 bar of Fels Naptha
1/2 C Arm & Hammer Washing Soda (not Baking Soda)
1/2 C Borax
1/2 to 1 ounce of essential oil, if desired
2 Gallon size bucket
Grate the bar of Fels Naptha soap into a pan. Add 6 cups water. Heat until the soap melts. Add the washing soda and borax and stir until dissolved making sure all the grated bar soap has melted. Pour into bucket. Add 4 cups very hot water. Stir. Add 1 gallon plus 6 cups hot water. Stir again. Let the soap sit overnight. It will form into a watery gel. Ready to use after about 24 hours.
Use 1/2 cup per load. You can use 1/4 cup for high efficiency washers. This soap has minimal suds but that is okay. The suds is an additive in commercial detergents.
This is wonderful if you have allergies.
This is also very cost effective.
Fels Naptha: $1.09 for 5 1/2 oz. bar
Borax: $4.26 for 76 oz.
Washing Soda: $2.57 for 55 oz.
So for $7.92 you can get all the ingredients. I checked Tide HE at Sam's Club and they sell it for $19.98 for 170 oz. bottle. The savings is at minimum is 1/20 the cost. So what are you waiting for?
This is the only detergent I use for my cloth diapers. I use the rinse only cycle (cold water) and then I add the detergent and wash my diapers on the sanitize cycle (hot water) and they come out great every time.
Good Luck!
Thanks Monica! I am very excited to try this out myself. I am trying out SO many new things with this challenge, and every one of them has been great so far, I'm sure your detergent will be too.
Because I LOVE Monica's recipes. Mostly the edible ones, but I can only imagine this one will be fantastic in a less delicious way.
Monica has also published a cookbook full of great recipes (the edible kind lol) called, simply enough, "Homemade Cookbook". She's planning on starting a recipe blog soon but if you're feeling hungry before then, you can email me at bogflower at gmail dot com and I'll give you all the info about ordering a cookbook of your own. They are $13 and chock full of family-friendly recipes.
So, after a great day of flat diapering, where does that leave us?
Total $$ Spent: $115.02 with tax (yet ANOTHER Walmart trip to get fleece and flannel for preschool overnight diapers)
Total Time Spent: 2:52 (added another Walmart trip, 6 changes, some time spent figuring out how to make a quick bedtime diaper, and half a "wash cycle")
Total Diapers Changed: 6
Total Leaks: 1
See you tomorrow!

Over this past weekend, we got the chance to take a spot on the Rockstar/Metal Mulisha tour bus and tag along for three stops of the 2009 Rockstar Mayhem Festival—Phoenix, Albuquerque, and Denver. At each stop, the Mulisha riders put on three jump demos while heavy metal bands played on two outdoor stages. Then when the sun went down, the crowd funneled into an amphitheater to watch Slayer and Marilyn Mansion on the main stage. There’s a lot that goes into putting a tour like this on than people might think and it was truly a crazy experience getting to be a part of it for three stops. If you’re interested in checking it out, go to to get more info on the rest of the tour dates and locations. Here are some photos from the trip, but be sure to check out an upcoming issue of TransWorld Motocross for a full feature.

After defeating the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 this afternoon to finish their 10-game road trip with a 5-5 record – not too shabby considering the quality of the competition – which combined with a loss from the White Sox leaves Detroit only 3 games behind once again. Combine that 5-5 road trip with the previous 4 consecutive interleague series and the Tigers are 13-9 over their last 22 games. This hasn’t been due to a surge in offense (though a little of that is due to the 9 games in which Tigers pitchers had to flail wildly at the ball. I hate National League baseball) – over those 22 games the Tigers have averaged a little less than 4.5 runs per game and a .740 OPS. Not awful but really not a plus. The Tigers have found some success through pitching – with a team ERA of 3.38 over that stretch. If only the team hadn’t allowed 15 unearned runs over those 22, we’d really be getting somewhere.
June 12, 2012; Minneapolis, MN, USA: Minnesota Twins left fielder Josh Willingham (16), center fielder Denard Span (2), and right fielder Ben Revere (11) celebrate after beating the Philadelphia Phillies at Target Field. The Twins won 11-7. Mandatory Credit: Jesse Johnson-US PRESSWIRE
Now the Tigers head home for 7 games before the All-Star Break. That’s 7 games against AL Central dregs Minnesota and Kansas City. If ever there was a time to hope for a 7-game streak, it would be now. If we lower our expectations just a hair, if the Tigers can win 4 of the 7 they will be a .500 team going into the break – not ideal but certainly not out of things.
Is it fair to call this stretch “critical”? In a sense all games are critical and in another sense games against other divisional contenders are doubly critical (since we not only want to win we want those specific teams to lose). The Twins and Royals – though really anything is possible – are unlikely to be the AL Central champion this year even should the Tigers be unable to climb back to the top of the heap. These games are critical only in the sense that the Tigers can’t reasonably hope to make the playoffs by beating teams like Boston and Tampa Bay but throwing games to awful teams like the Seattle Mariners (against whom the Tigers are 1-5 this season). The timing is also important – leading up to the All-Star break and the most intensive trading season prior to the non-waiver deadline at the end of the month. Whether the Tigers ought to buy or sell could be determined this week – or left an open question.
You’d like to say that the Tigers should have a pretty good chance to take both series and finish the season’s ‘first half’ not just at but over .500. That might not be true. For one thing – home field advantage around the league this year seems to have flat out disappeared. Look at the teams around the AL with better records on the road: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Minnesota. For another thing – as our Tigers commentators have been pointing out several times per game in anticipation of the Royals series – Kansas City is well over .500 since their terrible April start and barely behind the Tigers in the Central. Minnesota, on the other hand, started losing and has continued losing. A couple of their key guys in Liriano and Mauer have started producing, but there is so little overall talent on that roster at this point that it hasn’t mattered much. Unfortunately, the several Twins players who are likely to be dealt during the month of July will probably still be around to face Detroit over the next 4 days.
SO… TWINS coming to town means time for Tigers bats to continue their recent liveliness. The Twins have a 4.92 ERA and the lowest pitcher WAR of any team in baseball. The poor Twins are also the only team to strike out fewer than 6 batters per game so far this season. The Twins have also struggled to hit on the road this year with an MLB-worst .636 road OPS. Add in that the Tigers will miss Francisco Liriano while the Twins miss Drew Smyly and personally I will be unsatisfied with less than a 3-1 series win – while hoping for the sacred 4-game sweep. The ROYALS coming to town is more of a reason for concern and or consternation. In addition to having winning months in May and June, the Royals have a 3.73 road ERA on the season and have scored more runs on the road than they have allowed. The same cannot be said for the Tigers at home.

The CBR is said to be a heavy bike. I always knew that the CBR weighs at 167 kgs- what I didn’t know was that RE bikes weigh nearly the same. But riding wise I never found it heavy, it flicks with great poise in traffic and occasionally even with pillion I go flat out on my commute and to admit frankly I never found my ZMA so effortless as this one. In fact the P220 being lighter in comparison, I find it heavy to negotiate in traffic while crawling and at speeds. I have ridden much lighter bikes- but then I don’t get that stability confidence in case I happen to ride them like the CBR. So is it justified that the CBR is being spotlighted as an elephant and this very point being one of the factors that people add it to its negativity?
Premature conclusions on performance is the next thing. Haven’t ridden the KTM so can’t comment on the ride feel and the acceleration characteristics…though I can vouch that the KTM would give you more thrills than the CBR. In fact it’s obvious one might even end up under the impression that the KTM is much faster than it actually is. The CBR on the other hand would be happy to do all the drudge like a non-complaining housewife without much fuss…the same characteristic which many people loved in the ZMA while choosing it over the P220 despite being lesser on power specs. On the contrary just to add- post 6000 rpm, the CBR does go into a completely different element.
Continuing on similar lines…we have the handling factor. Now without second thoughts the bike that immediately and deservedly springs up is the R15. No arguing on the fact that it’s a great handler- but so much so talks go around that the CBR automatically is highlighted as a bad handling bike- which I feel it is not. I find it way way ahead of the neutral handling of the ZMA which is considered to be a good road-mannered motorcycle. Yes the suspension is soft and the front does dive on hard braking- but then it is what it should be like considering that 99% of the biking population ride their bikes on roads and not on track. If both bikes still had to be taken on track- no guessings who’d be coming out with faster laptimes. Well the CBR has more power would be an obvious comment…but then the P220 with its brute power still trails the R15 on laptimes…its not only about power, isn’t it? If I had to swap the CBR with an R15 for my daily use- within a week I will be coming back crying over a stiff body, I will say the same for the N250R as well. Practicality prevailing on the handling factor- won’t a CBR be a better proposition? Poking in with the KTM here which has a lovely soft suspension- in fact the rear is softer than the CBR at the softest settings- how it performs- time will tell. And finally coming back to the cornering ability here- I really wish to ask the level of skill of a rider who would be cribbing about the ‘not-so-great’ handling of the CBR. At what level of speed will a CBR falter i.e. the bike would lose its line during cornering, the front tyre losing traction or the rear fishtailing. I feel the line of error between the CBR and the R15 will be so much high up the graph that it will need an extremely talented and professional rider to actually push both bikes to a level where the handling limitation would come to light. I found the CBR a completely different animal on cornering when compared to my ZMA- initially I always had apprehensions cornering on the CBR, the first reason being not to crash a new bike and second the cornering technique on the ZMA doesn’t completely apply to this one. It was a very similar case when I rode the R15 for the first time- I was like why the heck is this bike not turning? More of body inputs and the bike reacts to where you want it to go. I had suspicions on the Contigo which were dismissed when Sheel mentioned that they are as grippy as the ones on the R15…its all in the mind isn’t it? Well coming back to the handling since that I have now started to get the hang of the CBR, I would admit that I have started loving taking corners on it without second and creepy thoughts. In the end I wish to question, a motorcycle excelling on a track would excel in real world conditions? If one has to pick a motorcycle for all round use and had to pick between say an R6 or an FZ6, or a CBR600RR or a 600 Hornet- what would be your choice?
And the issue that bought the CBR into a brighter limelight than the bike itself….QUALITY! Am not sure how deep to go into finding the quality issues. Starting off with the paint- I would rather ask myself as to what a bad quality paint job is. The only two bikes that made me go ga-ga over the paint has been the N250R and the N650R- simply outstanding finish, no other bike can really match them- but I do mind shelling out one bike’s cost for added quality. I can’t really compare the paintjob of the R15 and the CBR here for the fact that the red on the R15 is more maroonish and the one of the CBR that I have is metallic red. I would be grateful if someone could really highlight as to what a bad paint job really means.
Another is the point of criticism….ugly welding joints. Well here are a couple of pics of welding joints of different bikes. The rest are from high res pics sourced from the net except for the CBR.
My CBR- looks real bad?
The R15: Deltaframe joint looks good, look at the pillion frame weld.
The N250R…that’s a smooth finish?
The KTM200….again is that a smooth weld joint? Look at the chassis surface finishing.
Rusting:
My bike was gathering dust for a month at the godown- thanks to Bank of India who made me run around for one and a half month and finally asking me to go to a branch near my residence to avail the loan. When I got the bike, there was not a micron of rust on the bolts, chain or anywhere.
I was always impressed with the dashboard plastic quality of the R15 with lovely texture and great fitting….I find the CBR no different.
The engine coating on my bike is still as it was when compared to Parimal's first batch CBR (8000+ kms) which had peeling issues right after a few days. Honda was ready to replace the entire block just coz of the peeling from a few places- but he asked them to coat the block instead of replacing as he didn’t want to get into running in again. Though all the bolts were replaced including a new set of grab-rails.
Will end on the note with the words I started with…it’s not a post on defending a motorcycle just coz I have bought. It’s an extremely versatile and it feels a “built-to-go-well-everywhere-motorcycle” the moment you start riding it. And somehow it’s quite bad to see people going too much with criticism on quality and handling comparisons- which I have doubts about at present considering the new batch of bikes. Maybe Honda gave a specially made motorcycle to me. I might be light years away from a rider of a high order- but my riding experience (lotsa commuting and touring as well), I would say the CBR is a great recipe for real world conditions with a gem of an engine that pulls and pulls and pulls…..good stopping power and it excels at whatever you throw at it. Not forgetting to add the lovely EFI that is miserly to the core which during my commuting gives me fantastic mileage figures (35 to 40 kpl). The only grouse I had with my CBR was the quality of the brake pedal and the gear shifter….but then not enough to be a deal breaker to go ahead with.
I genuinely feel that the quality issues were taken care by Honda (one example cited of Parimal) and the new bikes are much much better (mine is one). So as for the bombardment of criticisms, I would say it’s time to look up and beyond and to what the CBR actually is.
Everyone has a right to disagree though.

Iconoclast is a near classic; it has some interesting cruxes that are mostly well protected while maintaining fairly easy climbing on a spectacular wall. Most of the climb shares pitches with Hyperspace while exiting the Iconoclast corner/dihedral system to the right for the Shield (Hyperspace continues up for two more pitches). The exposure on the Shield is wild as you roam around slinging chicken heads and a few sparce bolts. The start of Iconoclast begins after climbing the first two pitches of Remorse (typical and described below) or RPM. Remorse: Begin directly below the roofs that form the underside of Two Tree Ledge (you will be standing on the trail just to the left of the small scrub trees that are at the high point of the base of the wall). P1- 45m+ - 5.6 - Climb easy 4th class ledges and corners to a 4th class ledge system that angles up to the left. The ledge system ends 20' below a small bush in front of a large flake that typicallly has many slings around it. Climb the right groove up and traverse left to the bush/flake. P2- 25m+ - 5.8 - The next pitch traverses left all the way to the Psychopath ledge; start with some groove and face climbing up left aiming for the undercling flake; work your way back down the flake and traverse until you are forced into a balancy no hands traverse to more cracks; continue left along a rounded ledge (that works better for hands than feet) and finish with a mini crux up to the Psychopath ledge. Belay either at solid cracks and tree prior to the ledge proper, or continue across the gravelly ledge to the tree on the far side. These can be climbed as one pitch with a 70m rope, or some very easy simulclimbing for 20+ feet (for the second) until the lead can gain the Psychopath ledge and set a belay. Iconoclast: Many people will climb the Pyschopath crack as a variation from here. P3- 35m - 5.8+ - Around the Corner: Traverse out left (one bolt) and around the corner on some easy but exposed face climbing until you reach a crack; continue up the crack until ledges and cracks above the Pyschopath crack. P4- 50m - 5.10a - The Roof Pitch: Follow the cracks/corner up to a excellent hand crack corner roof (a short fun move over); continue up alongside the block of doom; a solid belay is possible at the top of the block of doom (in cracks to the left of the block). Be wary of the block doom as it is HUGE and seems to be detached and ready to release. The rockfall appears to be from 2008 P5- 45m - 5.10c - The Dihedral Pitch: Pull a second roof directly from the belay and follow up and over into a corner ledge that leads to the dihedral. An interesting (short) traverse down puts you under a dirty looking dihedral (it climbs clean), work up through secure but pumpy moves of the dihedral (good pro) (alternatively the right side face of the dihedral goes at 5.11a); continue up easier terrain to a two bolt belay. P6- 50m - 5.10c - Transition to the Shield: Follow the corner up to the tree (or work a crimp/ledge ladder out left that leads back into the corner tree); head right climbing the face up around the corner (one bolt and sparse/small pro); don't forget to look over/around the corner for the chicken head saviors; finish up the face of the Shield through easy chicken head terrain (two bolts spaced wildly apart and maybe a slung chicken head) to a two bolt belay at a tree. P7- 25m - 5.7 - The Mini Dihedral: Follow a short but beautiful little left-facing dihedral with a 2" crack in the back of it that leads directly to the left most end of Library Ledge; two bolt belay. Most parties will follow the last two pitches (68 meters) of Outerspace from hear. P8- 55m - 5.10b A0 - Continue up the 5.10b slab climbing (sparse? bolts) from the left side of Library Ledge to a bolt ladder. (I have not climbed this pitch so beta is second hand)
Approach Snow Creek Wall via the Snow Lakes Trail. Stay on the trail for ~1.5 miles, until you just enter the trees (parallel to the wall). A trail down through the woods leads to a log crossing on Snow Creek, and up to the wall at the base of P1. A windstorm from the winter of 2010/2011 obliterated the trail proper for a few hundred feet on either side of the creek, follow the path of least resistance (look for rock cairns and cut branches through/on the maze of logs) The walkoff from the top is to the left or you can rappel the route with two ropes.
Medium Rack to 3"; 1 set of nuts doubles of cams #.5 to #2
The Psychopath variation is really fun, not particularly hard, but the crux is techy and tricky. I would recommend continuing past the block of doom about 25' to the base of the dihedral on P4 if you've got a 70m. The belay will be more comfortable with better pro and the belayer will be able to see their climber. I would also link P6 & P7 together, take a #2 & #3 C4 to protect the mini dihedral. We didn't find the two widely spaced bolts on the face before the belay at the tree, but there were a couple of nut and cam placements to supplement the bolts, and the climbing was super easy after turning the corner onto the sheild.

I agree that enforcing the return time will lessen the waits on both the fastpass line and the standby line at the end of the day, or at other high peak times.
One thing that hasnt been mentioned is the flip side to this. Since the amount of fastpasses per day per attraction remains the same -if people do come back at the window instead of later, the stand-by and the fastpass lines during the day must get a little longer.
The extra waiting time wont be as bad as late in the day since these extra in the time window people are spread over a longer time frame

Working hard for that next WDW trip! December 2013
We were in WDW 9-25 thru 10/2 and they were only enforcing start times on the fastpasses. We did use them later in the day and nothing was said.
I want to say right off the bat, that I have not read every post in this thread, but I agree with them wanting to enforce the return time. I believe it will be a more efficient way to keep the lines moving faster. However, I disagree with some posts that want a grace period. As the saying goes, if you give an inch, they will take a mile. If Disney allows 1 hr or whatever after the printed time, if the family returns 5 minutes after that 1 hour grace period, they will cause a stink about that. I wouldn't be opposed to a 2 hour formal return time, instead of the one hour time.

When I was there this past May, we were in the studio room of the Rocking Roller Coaster ride and the CM came in and just threw a ton of fastpasses all over the floor. She responded with "Oops, I dropped something. Oh well, I guess you guys benefit from my clumsiness". I picked up a couple and they were Fastpasses from earlier that day. There was easily 100 or so scatter all over the place. No one knew what to do until someon said that you could use them anytime in the day. Then people started picking all the tickets around them.

Accounting for issues of disability which is different everyone has the same opportunity to run around 'willy nilly' for fast passes. I think it's kind of a choice really. Planning for best exploitation of fast pass is the same as any other park touring strategy. The better you plan, the more you can exploit it. Remember fast passes you get for super headliners around early lunch often have quite a late return time. We often do this, go back for a swim then come back to the same park later and use fast passes within their correct window. It's all in the planning and how much back tracking you are prepared to do to exploit the (legitimate) use of fast pass to the max. Me and my DH take it in turns to be the fast pass runner.
If no-one out there understands, start your own revolution and cut out the middle man (Billy Bragg)
If your within the window then of course its totally cool. I just mean if you grabbed one at 9:30 AM and the window was 10:30-11:30, but you didnt use it until the peak time of the day at say 3 in the afternoon, thats budding into the 'line' IMO and goes against the spirit of the system and against the spirit of Disney World in general.
I think return times should have been enforced from the start, I've seen people get their fast passes and imediately enter the attraction well before they're even supposed to initially return, Disney does need to crack down on the issue, I myself always return the minute I am allowed I never wait till the last 10 minutes or so if I did that I'd forget about it and I already have a collection of unused fast passes at home, back to the topic, it would cut wait times in half I'm in California and our space mountain fast pass line as of late has been almost as long as the stand by wait line and I bet its full of abusers
he's on the breakaway!! he shoots, he scores!!!
Got back from the World a week and a bit ago, and all our FPs were being checked carefully for times before we were allowed on any rides. I don't know whether we would have been able to use them later than the stated times, we didn't try. Apart from one time when Big Thunder Mountain broke down and we were told to come back later; when we did, the CM looked carefully at our FPs and then back at us, until we explained that they were from the time it had broken down (a couple of hours earlier); then they let us through okay.
Silvercat
I am leaving in a few hours and wanted make sure I got this correct.Show up between 330 and 430 as my FP says and I am safe! If I go past 430 which I never have I will be turned away?
Kathy
If they are enforcing the return time, which they apparently tested and may or may not have abandoned. It's obviously safest to return during the return time but the fact that a crackdown/test made the news does indicate it's not the normal procedure.
If convenient, you could chat up a fastpass CM and casually ask how strictly the fastpass return time is being enforced on the day you are there. Since we don't know when they may choose to enforce return times that would likely be the safest course of action, aside from simply returning during the appropriate window.
During MouseAdventure in the Studios on November 12th, it was recommended that we "get fastpasses for Star Tours" and I don't think anyone was turned away for coming late (when we'd figured out what we needed to look for). I know we were HOURS later than our return time.
Cathy
I'm at WDW right now and today my wife and I used Buzz Lightyear FPs about 2 hours after the return window had ended. The CM didn't comment or anything.
Arnold
A few days ago when I was still there, they only checked the date and start time of the FP window. This has been the same experience I have had each year. I don't think they enforce the end time on the FP because sometimes rides can go down, etc., so I'd bet it's a policy that they only need to check the date and window start time for the FP's.

DCL - 9/09 Eastern (Magic), 11/10 Western (Magic), 11/11 Bahamas (Dream), 8/12 Nowhere (Magic), 12/12 Eastern (Fantasy), 5/13 Caribbean (Wonder)
We just returned. We used several fast passes after their window was over.... mostly because we had the luck of getting fast passes every single time smack dab in the middle of an ADR. These were for ones like Toy Story that we *had* to get first thing or not get one at all. No one ever questioned us when we returned to use them.
I do have to say the parks were MUCH more crowded than the "predictions" seemed to suggest so fast passes were really necessary.

Change four years now. Our new apartment is our first place that has just about all we ever wanted in a home minus the option to have a pet. It is also the first time we have felt that we can start a home together.
Our first place together was the apartment I lived in during my college years which was perfect for me and my room-mate, but when he moved out and Emily moved in, it was an awkward transition and we never really felt like that was our home. We then moved out to the country where the air was clear and free of the city noise. It was a nice place with cheap rent, but it was also just a move of convenience.
We had just both graduated and Emily was blessed with a teaching job at Kings Valley Charter School, a small country school with about a hundred students. Our new place was only ten minutes away from her work. As I struggled to find a full time job, subbing as much as possible, I ended up staying home a lot. It was nice to be able to have the time to myself and to be able to think about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, but a person can only do that for so long. And neither of us we able to really feel at home because of the conditions of our new place…smelly water, no storage, no closets, no dishwasher (I love dishwashers), no mailing address of our own, and being twenty minutes from the nearest grocery store wasn’t exactly convenient. We did, however, enjoy being close to some good friends of ours who also work at the charter school.
Well, I finally landed a job as a high school Humanities teacher at…you guessed it…the same school Emily works at. KVCS added 9th grade this year with plans to add a grade each consecutive year. This year has been more than I could ever hope for. It is a joy to come to work everyday and be a part of my students’ lives. This job is probably the most demanding job I can think of, but I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else or doing anything but this.
So, we can finally afford a nice, new place in the city. A place we can finally create a living space that we can enjoy to its fullest and be the hosts that we’ve always wanted to be. We love having friends over and we can’t wait to enjoy that company.
Moving forward, change, hope, growth…all these things are good. But the truth is they mean nothing if you don’t share it with somebody. We may face challenges in this life, but we are never alone. When you work with somebody you can accomplish anything, go wherever you want to go and do whatever you want to do. It just takes a little work, some patience and a positive attitude.

As people age and want to stay in their homes it is important to have a health care plan that will work to enable them to stay safe and as healthy as possible. Home health care enables the person to have the comforts of their home combined with the healthcare ordered by their doctor. Skilled nursing makes the plan work. Certainly, certified nursing assistants are important, and enable the home health care process to work, but the requirements of skilled nursing are essential. Medications must be administered correctly, health assessments need to be done, and medical procedures often need to be administered at home. With skilled nursing staff, dressings are changed, wounds are looked after and attention can be provided for specialized problems and concerns.
There are many reasons to use MR Homecare skilled nursing services. The natural progression of aging often brings on declining health, but other reasons can prevail as well. Often an accident can require a long period of recuperation. Skilled nursing care can enable the healing process to be take place at home. Home health care professional can change dressings, administer therapy, take vitals and do health assessments. This much needed information is passed on to doctors who can keep up with the patient’s health through the skilled nursing care services.
Often a disease can be debilitating but not immediately a threat to life. Years of dealing with a disease can cause a lot of stress on the patient and a family. Having the opportunity to be in a familiar setting is a something that can take a lot of pressure off a family as the patient deals with the disease. Simple things such as a personal bedroom to rest in, private bathroom and the opportunity to move about in familiar surroundings are all made possible with skilled nursing assistance. A person can enjoy independence and recuperate at the same time.
The services MR Homecare provides enable a doctor to carefully monitor patient’s condition and care program. Having viatl signs and assessments transmitted by nurses can enable a quick diagnosis to be made without the inconvenience of going to a doctor’s office. This is a strong convenience to patients and family.
When skilled nursing assistance is offered as an option, most people will quickly take advantage of the opportunity. Being able to be as comfortable as possible during an illness or accident can give a great psychological boost and better health.

Another division win puts Fox in elite company
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) long list of Denver's achievements to be met with almost no fanfare inside the locker room.
''You do this to win championships,'' Fox said.
He's talking about Super Bowls, not divisions, and his team, with a 9-3 record, a seven-game winning streak and Peyton Manning playing some of the best football of his career, is shaping up to be as legitimate a contender as anyone.
The Broncos play at Oakland on Thursday. Currently, they are the fourth seed in the AFC, with a game against Baltimore set for Dec. 16. Denver has a significantly easier schedule than two of the teams ahead of it, Baltimore and New England, so the No. 2 seed and the first-round bye that goes with it are both within reach.
Don't bother asking Fox or any of his players too much about that sort of big-picture stuff, however.
''The most important thing right now is to keep on stacking days, keep on stacking weeks, keep taking it one day at a time,'' linebacker Von Miller said. ''I feel like hear what you say. I only hear what you do.
Setting that tone is Fox, the coach, who has the backing and guidance of quarterback-turned-executive John Elway, then had Manning fall into his lap. Some say that makes his job easier. Some say it makes it harder because of the pressure to win - and win now - that goes with being surrounded by those people, those names.
Fox's hiring was viewed skeptically in large portions of Denver. Yes, he was a veteran coach with a winning record (He's now 96-86) and one Super Bowl appearance, but he was coming off a 2-14 record in his final season at Carolina.
Hidden beneath that terrible record was the fact that his players played hard for him all year and that Fox, a lame duck coach with a depleted roster, kept smiling and stayed positive through the entire thing.
When Elway was looking for a coach in Denver, the Broncos were coming off a 4-12 season that included the midseason firing of Josh McDaniels and the awkward presence of McDaniels' first-round draft pick, Tim Tebow, who didn't get into the starting lineup until after the coach was gone.
''When I looked at this building when I first got here after the 2010 season, everyone was demoralized,'' Elway said in a recent interview. ''The one thing that stuck with me with John was the positive attitude. Outgoing. Friendly. Positive. To me, that was the No. 1 characteristic. It was the simple fact of the way he was. I felt he could get this organization rehabilitated, get everyone excited about playing football again.''
And, Elway said, there was Fox's ''knack for football,'' honed over 34 years in the business, first as a graduate assistant in college, then through five stops in the NFL, starting as secondary coach in Pittsburgh in 1989, before he got the head job in Carolina in 2002.
Never did that knack work better than during the 2011 season, his first with the Broncos.
Unfazed by the prospect of building a system around a player, rather than making the player adjust to the system, Fox and offensive coordinator Mike McCoy set aside their egos and, many might say, set back offense by about 50 years by bringing the read option back to the NFL to give.

Get a sneak preview at the new Australis tabs (Windows only)
18 June, 2012 § 87 Comments
Wanna play with a sneak peek of the new Australis tabs for Firefox? I’ve put together a build of it that you can download and run with.
This isn’t checked in yet, but it should be coming along soon. I only implemented it for Windows, so my apologies go out to those on OS X or Linux.
Let me know what you think in the comments
I really like the use of extreme focus on the current tab relative to background tabs, I often can’t quickly spot which tab I am currently on in Firefox.
I’m not very fond of the curvy curves though, I like the boxyness of the current tabs, it makes it feel very digitial rather than artificially trying to impersonate real surfaces.
[...] Wein, sviluppatore di Mozilla ha rilasciato (ma solo per Windows) una build di Firefox 16 equipaggiata con Australis che dovrebbe garantire maggior freschezza visiva al browser della volpe. [...]
I briefly studied bezier curves for a programming course and something looks ‘unnatural’ at the inflection points. Blend where curves join horizontal base looks abbreviated. Text closeness to top makes square tab icons and close icon nearly touch edge. Tabs seem tall. Inactive tab top fade looks good. When active tab is first or last, Inactive tab vertical separators may be causing an illusion where active tab curves appears asymetric left to right. Overall, looks promising.
Do you have an idea when this will be implemented in the official 16a1?
Unfortunately I don’t have a good idea of when. You should ask @frankyan as he might have a better idea than I do.
What about UX build ?
when could we have an other update ?
I’m runnig UX but not implemented yet…
Hopefully soon, it is just based on when I have time. I really want it on the UX branch also

After shopping my favorite trendy slut stores in Soho, I was dying to get back.
Well today's my last day in the BK and it's bittersweet. I've made a lot of connections and met some pretty cool people. I'm already planning a trip back, lol!

A Surgeons Joke
Five surgeons are talking.Five surgeons are talking.
The first says: " I like to see accountants on my operating table, because when you open them up, everything inside is
numbered. "
The second responds: " Yeah, but you should try electricians. Everything inside of them is color coded. "
The third says: " No, I really think librarians are the best, everything inside of them is in alphabetical order. "
The fourth chimes in: " You know, I like construction workers.... those guys always understand when you have a few parts left over. "
But, the fifth shut them all up when he observed: " You're all wrong. Politicians are the easiest to operate on. There's no guts, no heart, no balls, no brains, and no spine, -- and the head and the ass are interchangeable."
5 Comments:
This would obviously include you, since you ran for governor!
You are confused. I ran for governor because it was already true. One does not become a politician by running for office. (Though one can become a FAILED politician by losing, to be sure!) The description given has ALWAYS been accurate for me.
Of the many things I've learned from this blog, the perfection of self-deprecating sarcasm must be among the most vital.
I am thoroughly convinced in this said post. I am currently searching for ways in which I could enhance my knowledge in this said topic you have posted here

Post subject:
Hi Repip,
Thanks again for the information, and taking the time to hand-copy it. (Yes, it would be hard to guess which of the many icons was for the text editor when the icons and their text captions were corrupt.
)
I am glad to hear that the icons have been restored.
The information you supplied shows that the file /etc/DISTRO_SPECS contains this line:
Code:
DISTRO_ARCHDIR=''
I think that is the problem. It should be:
Code:
DISTRO_ARCHDIR='i386-linux-gnu'
If you would like the boring details of what this "386-linux-gnu" stuff is about, read this quotation. If not, feel free to skip over it. (Since you are a Windows user, and new to linux, I'll first mention that the libraries I am talking about are usually Linux "shared object" (.so) files, which are similar to Windows "dynamic linked library" (.dll) files.)
In another thread, I wrote:
Debian and distros descended from Debian, such as Ubuntu, support "multiarch", which allows a library to have, for instance, both an Intel 32-bit build and an AMD (or Intel) 64-bit build installed on the same PC. (That is one example -- many other architectures are supported.) To do this, Debian and friends will sometimes put libraries built for the 32-bit Intel architecture ("i386") in /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ or /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ instead of the usual /lib/ or /usr/lib/, respectively.
Other distros may handle this differently.
Currently, Puppy continues to use the standard /lib/ and /usr/lib/ directories. For compatibility with Ubuntu packages, Precise Puppy has symlinks from /lib/i386-linux-gnu and /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu to /lib/ and /usr/lib/, respectively.
The problem you have run into is that sometimes when installing a .deb package from a Debian or Ubuntu repository, those symlinks get overwritten, so some needed libraries are not where they are expected to be.
The Puppy Package Manager (PPM) in Precise 5.4.2 has code that moves the newly installed library files to their correct Puppy location and restores the symlinks. But that code depends upon DISTRO_ARCHDIR being set with the proper value, which -- for reasons I don't know -- it is not.
(Some of the commands I gave in my previous post were copied from that code, so when you executed them you were doing manually what would have been done automatically if DISTRO_ARCHDIR had been set properly.)
(I hope I'm not boring you with needless details. I'm being even more long-winded than usual here since you said that your were "really keen to learn a little about Puppy", but perhaps you were thinking of things other than all this nuts & bolts stuff.
)
Repip wrote:
It really is a simple quick exercise to completely reload Puppy anyway so I am willing to try anything at this point.
I am glad that you are so willing and able to experiment.
If you are happy to have your icons back again, and ready to move on to other things, feel free to do so. But if you would like to try something else related to this problem, consider trying this:
1. Assuming that you are now able to find a text editor, use it to open /etc/DISTRO_SPECS.
2. Look for the line that begins with "DISTRO_ARCHDIR" -- it will be the same as the line in the first Code box earlier in this post.
3. Change it by adding
i386-linux-gnu
between the single quotation marks, so that it looks like the second Code box in this post.
4. Save the file.
5. Now try installing VLC Player again, and see if it installs without messing up your icons again.
If it works, it may save you from seeing your icons go crazy again when you install some future Ubuntu package. If it doesn't work, well . . . you get the fun of installing Puppy again!
Good luck.

Yes, it was. Your reports made it clear that the code that was supposed to fix the problem wasn't executing, and your report of
DISTRO_ARCHDIR=' '
showed us why.
Barry has implemented a fix for the problem, which will be included in his next Service Pack for Precise.
See my bug report at
and Barry's blog entry:
DISTRO_ARCHDIR variable not set

Here we are again, with me trying to introduce something to you that you may not have ever heard of. It's another weird one as well I'm afraid! When I first listened to this record more than a year ago, I literally couldn't, for reasons that will become apparent later. Now however, on return, I find my musical ears matured, and decided to try and review it. Sleigh Bells are a noise pop duo hailing from Brooklyn, with Derek E. Miller, former guitarist for metalcore band Poison the Well, joining with Alexis Krauss, who previously worked with teen pop band Rubyblue. That collaboration is a strange one, but they manage to pull it off with a messy flourish. They don't make the two different styles merge together, but rather create a new identity with influences from both. That makes for very original music though, let me tell you. The soft and the harsh side by side creates a shattered, crazy world, where things seep and blend into each other. Sprout flavoured lollipops. Flowery death metal bands. Imagine the chaos, and squash that into a record.
This isn't for everyone, and in their very specific and at times abrasive sound, they're restricting themselves from people. Whether this is a good thing or not, I don't know. I myself can't listen to this for a very long time without a headache, which turns the appeal right down, but I appreciate the attempt to create something completely unseen, by me at least. Some songs aren't bad, but others, queue 'Tell 'Em', are relentless, and the mixture of high vocals, lower throbbing bass and chugging guitar, all lathered in reverb, isn't that enjoyable. The rhythm and beats present on every track however, are very addictive and pulse-quickening, which seems to be Sleigh Bells default setting. So, half marks from me.
'Kids' electronic whirrs set off another flurry of vocals overlaying vocals, but the sampled schoolgirl voices are a nice touch of variety to the album. It's an asylum of fun and disregard for rules, but the mixture doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The only track I think I could listen to more than twice is 'Rill Rill', with it's acoustic twang and instrumentation more suited to Krauss' higher vocal range. The lyrics flow and although repetitive, this works when paired with the very repetitive backing. 'Straight A's' however? Ewww. The muffled bass buffets your ears, drowning out the vocals in the noisiest track I've heard in a long while. The singing on 'A/B Machines' are backed by nice electronic guitars, but then it all descends into headache-inducing chaos. Again.
I think I'd better get my opinion across better than I actually have. I appreciate this album, a lot. I appreciate the messiness, loosely tied with the strings of rhythm and repetition. I appreciate the effort to create something different to nearly everything else out there, and I appreciate the instrumentation and careful production. Having said all that, I can listen to it, which is more than I could a year ago, but I simply don't enjoy it. The noise is too much. I would have preferred for the band to keep the very loud, fast, pounding noise to one or two tracks, with perhaps a slightly toned down approach for the rest. Even though this would have probably lost them their edge over other, less original artists, it would have certainly been better than the almost constant musical bombardment I had to endure here, for just over half an hour. It doesn't sound long, and relatively, it isn't. It does however, grate on your nerves a little when you can't hear yourself think. Like I said before, if you think you'll enjoy this, go ahead, but 'Treats' definitely isn't for everybody. Criticise my lacking musical palette, but it's my opinion at the end of the day!

Karunanidhi says, Jayalalithaa Is Fooling People
DMK chief M Karunanidhi today hit out at archrival and Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa for blaming his party’s rule for the bad health of the state PSUs, indicating the new government has “nothing” to claim for itself on the projects front, including power generation.
Recalling the budget speech made by Finance Minister O Pannseerselvam in August after the AIADMK stormed to power, Karunanidhi said the former had mentioned Tamil Nadu was in the forefront in E-Governance, SMEs and manufacturing sector besides betting on power generation projects.
“It was mentioned that new power generation projects would yield 3,280 mw of power in 2011-12. This refers to the projects taken up during the DMK regime and not in the (then) three-month old AIADMK rule,” he said in a statement here.
The AIADMK government had, on Nov 17, announced a steep hike on the prices of milk and bus fares. Jayalalithaa had also indicated the power tariff would also go up in the wake of mounting losses suffered by the state-run power supplier.
Jayalalithaa had yesterday defended the price hikes, saying the “the painful decision” had been taken to save the PSUs—Aavin and state transport corporations, which were left in “bad health” by the previous DMK government.
She also dismissed as a “bag of lies” Karunanidhi’s earlier statement that despite officials’ request, he had not allowed rise in prices of milk and bus fares. “He is only pretending to speak for the people. They are aware of his crocodile tears,” she added.
Karunanidhi wondered if it was “just” on the part of Jayalalithaa to issue statements blaming the DMK government.
“They had also promised to slowly do away with power cuts after improving the situation. But the situation today is that power cut has been increased from two to five hours (in rural areas),” he said.
“No new power generation projects have been started. And she blames me for shedding crocodile tears. But people won’t be fooled by all this,” Karunanidhi said.

The major attention at Christmas is the thought of giving and getting.
Why is not more thought and planning given to selecting gifts which honor that “Birthday Boy,” Jesus? This person gave a supreme gift unmatched by any earthly gifts no matter the amount.
Consider the business known as Sears Department store and their gift in support of our military personnel for years. As long as the war has lasted, Sears hasn’t withdrawn from their commitment to their employees who serve in the military. Sears holds their jobs open and available, paying the difference in salaries and maintaining all benefits, including medical insurance and bonus programs.
Bill Thorn, Sears Customer Care official, verified this employee commitment, saying, “Sears regards service to our country as one of the greatest sacrifices our military men and women can make.” Could we each buy at least one thing at Sears this Christmas and throughout the year as well? Be sure to find a manager to tell them why we are there so the company gets the feedback it deserves.
As you open your pocketbooks for assisting with donations for Christmas or the next natural disaster, ask how much of the donation ever makes it to the needy ones.
Remember that the American Red Cross president-CEO got a salary for 2011 of $951,957 and expenses. The United Way president receives $675,000 base salary and numerous expense benefits. UNICEF CEO receives $1.9 million annually, plus all expenses and a Rolls Royce; less than 5 cents per donated dollar goes to the cause. The Salvation Army Commissioner’s annual salary is $13,000 plus housing for managing this $2 billion organization so that 96 percent of donated dollars goes to their causes.
Remember that the national commanders of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, Vietnam Veterans Association and the Military Order of Purple Hearts — all receive zero salary so that your donations all go to their respective causes to help veterans and their families and youth.
May our donations this year say a resounding “Happy Birthday, Jesus.”

Suppliers of high-power transistors continue to improve on processing and packaging as new devices show improvements in power density, linearity, and efficiency.
Transistor developers continue to push for higher power levels from a single die or package, but not to the exclusion of other performance parameters. Especially for commercial communications applications, device designers now emphasize improved linearity and efficiency so that amplifier designers can create smaller and lighter units for mobile radios and compact base stations. What follows is a sampling of recent developments in RF and microwave power transistors.
Several device announcements were made at the recent IEEE Microwave Theory & Techniques Symposium (MTT-S, June 10-12, Philadelphia, PA), including the launch of several high-voltage high-frequency (HF) MOSFET devices by Advanced Power Technology RF (). Both are nominally intended for HF amplifiers and RF plasma generators at frequencies from 1.5 to 30 MHz. The ARF465A/B, for example, dissipates as much as 250 W power and generates as much as 125 W output power when operating with a +300-VDC supply. The larger model ARF1505 dissipates as much as 1500 W power and generates output levels to 750 W CW from a +300-VDC supply. The rugged design features a power density of 700 W/in.2
At the show, the company also announced two new lateral-diffused MOS (LDMOS) transistors for pulsed avionics and radar applications, the 110-W peak-power model 1011LD110 and the 200-W peak-power model 1011LD200. The +32-VDC transistors offer gain levels of 13 and 12 dB, respectively, over the 1030-to-1090-MHz Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) avionics band.
Advanced Semiconductor () features a wide range of CW and pulsed RF power transistors, including a wide range for DME/TACAN avionics applications from 1025 to 1150 MHz. Several devices with internal input and output matching networks offer output-power levels of 250 W and more, including the 400-W model AVD400 and the 500-W model AVD500. These +50-VDC parts both feature minimum efficiency of 40 percent with respective gains of 6.5 and 5.6 dB.
Philips Semiconductors () is a long-time supplier of high-power transistors, and features several RF bipolar models for TACAN and JTIDS avionics applications (roughly 960 to 1215 MHz), including the models MX0912B251Y and the MX0912B351Y. The former features 275 W of pulsed output power while the latter produces 375 W of pulsed output power. Both devices yield 7.5-dB gain at 45-percent efficiency.
Another veteran device supplier, M/A-COM (Tyco Electronics), offers both power bipolar and MOSFET devices for a wide range of applications, including the model PH1090-700B bipolar transistor for pulsed avionics applications. The gold-metalized, ceramic-packaged device delivers 700 W of pulsed (32-µs pulses at a 2-percent duty cycle) output power from 1030 to 1090 MHz. The +65-VDC device features 7.5-dB power gain with 50-percent collector efficiency.
Additional high-power silicon transistor suppliers include Polyfet RF Devices () and Point Nine Technologies (). Polyfet's model SR401 is a +28-VDC push-pull transistor capable of 300 W output power at 175 MHz. The transistor features 13 dB gain and 55-percent efficiency.
Point Nine's model C203, one of the company's line of TetraFET devices, is usable to 1 GHz. The silicon DMOS device employs gold metalization to gain 100 W output power from a +28-VDC supply. The rugged transistor achieves 10 dB gain with 40-percent drain efficiency. Another of the company's TetraFETs, the model D1027, provides 200 W output power at frequencies from DC to 300 MHz. The +28-VDC transistor generates 17 dB gain with 50-percent efficiency.
"Plastic" was the key word at the Motorola () booth during the show, as the company unveiled several plastic-packaged MOSFETs, including the MRF5S9101MR1 which is designed for applications to 1 GHz. The device yields 105 W 1-dB-compression CW output power at 960 MHz with 16.5 dB gain and 56-percent efficiency. Capable of operating at +26 or +28 VDC, the device is well suited for GSM base-station applications, with error-vector-magnitude (EVM) performance of 3 percent.
STMicroelectronics () is developing a new family of +100-VDC high-power VHF/UHF MOSFETs. The new process utilizes enhanced raised-gate technology for feedback capacitance reduction and optimized deep body doping to improve load mismatch tolerance. Proprietary techniques result in increased breakdown voltages and reduced parasitic capacitance, with a 6-dB increase in power gain compared to standard +50-VDC devices. The transistors employ thermally enhanced nonpedestal packaging and will be available in 150-W (model SD3931-10) and 300-W (model SD3933) single-ended configurations as well as a dual 300-W (model SD3932) configuration. The devices are currently being evaluated in a variety of applications, including plasma generators and magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) systems.
At somewhat higher frequencies, Mitsubishi Semiconductors () announced the availability of a pair of internally matched GaAs FET devices for Ku-band very-small-aperture-terminal (VSAT) satellite-communications applications. The model MGFK41A4045 delivers 12 W output power in the 14.0-to-4.5-GHz VSAT band while the model MGFK44A4045 produces 24 W output power from 14.0 to 14.5 GHz.
Also serving satellite-communications applications, the TIM5964-90SL GaAs FET from Toshiba America Electronic Components () promises 90 W (+49.5 dBm) output power from 5.9 to 6.4 GHz. The internally matched C-band transistor helps amplifier designers reduce the number of parts in their designs by replacing several lower-power devices. The transistor features 7 dB typical gain with 30-percent typical power-added efficiency (PAE) and a third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD) of typically −40 dBc.
The use of internal impedance matching allows Excelics Semiconductor () to provide as much as 8 W output power at VSAT frequencies. For example, the company's models EIA1415A-8P and EIA1415B-8P are internally matched GaAs FETs with 6 and 8 dB gain, respectively, from 14.0 to 15.35 GHz; both devices yield 8 W output power over that range. The devices are rated for PAE of 20 percent and third-order intercept point of +46 dBm.
Another supplier with an extensive lineup of internally matched devices, Fujitsu Compound Semiconductor (wwwfcsi.fujitsu.com), offers numerous C-band devices include the model FLM3742-25F. Designed for +10-VDC supplies, the transistor achieves +44.5-dBm output power with 10.5 dB typical gain and 41-percent efficiency from 3.7 to 4.2 GHz.
California Eastern Laboratories () offers the NE650103M power GaAs FET for L- and S-band applications through 2.7 GHz. Ideal for PCS and wireless-local-loop (WLL) applications, the device operates from a +10-VDC supply with 10 W (+40 dBm) output power and 42-percent typical efficiency. The power gain is typically 11 dB at 2.7 GHz.
Several power-transistor processes that have yet to gain wide acceptance among amplifier designers include those based on silicon-carbide (SiC) and gallium-nitride (GaN) substrates. For the former, Cree () has offered several versions of a 10-W device for several years. Now available as model CRF-24010, the device is usable to 2.7 GHz with at least 10 W output power and 15 dB gain.
Because of the high-power potential of materials such as SiC and GaN, large defense contractors such as BAE Systems () and Northrop Grumman Corp. () have made major investments in device development. More details will be available at the upcoming Third Annual Military Electronics Show (, Baltimore, MD, September 16-17, 2003).

In which all we do is eat or talk about eating - I'm not hungry for nothing...
A few of us around him pointed out that actually, he'd been to Tulsa, Orlando, San Antonio, Narramata and one other place which I don't remember now. He looked sourly at us, and with tears brimming, snapped at us, "They don't count! It's not even international, and besides they were work or family trips and everyone knows they're not real trips. It's not fair, I've not been travelling in YEARS!"
As it happened, I was heading out to Chicago for a few days for a meeting, so he sneaked into my baggage and I saw him climbing out of my bag just as I was heading to the hotel lobby to look for dinner.
"Ah there you are", he beamed graciously as if he'd been kept waiting by me, "it's just about time for a little snack isn't it? And that was the start of a week's worth of eating rich, fatty and fried foods. Prosciutto with a fig glaze and caramelized onion on crisp flat bread was what I had.
You see, DWE and ML had been contemptuous of the choice of hotel - JW Marriott - and had sent us a little video to warn us about the chambermaids. We had scoffed at him, only to be woken up by a huge banging on our door in the early morning and shrieks of "Maid service!" We turned them away, and they were obviously not happy with the rejection.
In the evening after a long day at the conference, I was chivvied into two coats, my scarf and hat by
1) raiding the room fridge and 2) opening the half bottle of wine in the room. However, he thought better of it when he saw the prices for option 1, and realised that the hotel had used full BC liquor pricing for the half-bottle. In fact, for option 1, the items in the fridge were placed on sensitive pads which had a sixty second delay if items were removed, after which time the exorbitant charges were placed on the room tab.
I told
Oh yes. Fried chicken. One thigh, one drumstick and a breast the size of Dolly Parton's coated in cornflakes then deep fried. Macaroni and cheese (an entree in its own right) for a side. Nary a vegetable in sight. Fries too. And of course for
Then back to the hotel where there was a game - Kentucky and Kansas - the finale to March Madness, and of course more wine was had to celebrate the win by Kentucky (or was it Kansas?). I had tea instead. That night, the wine must have gone to
Anyway, back to Ted Baker Chicago - I wanted a pair of slacks to go with the perfect jacket for me -

Philosophy deals with the kinds of questions that engage all reflective people, but which seemingly cannot be dealt with by any of the empirical sciences: Is everything material? Is human behavior determined or is free choice possible? Are there objective standards for deciding what is right and wrong, or is morality merely a subjective matter, a matter of individuals’ feelings? Is there a moral obligation to obey the law? Can we justify our claims to know anything? Can we objectively distinguish rational from irrational beliefs? How does language relate to the world?
The study of philosophy encourages rigorous and disciplined habits of mind. Because the major in philosophy emphasizes and enhances analytical skills, it is useful for the large number of careers that require these skills or as general humanistic training at the undergraduate level. Two concentrations within the major accommodate differences in student needs and interests and reflect the two central concerns of philosophy. (1) The Core Philosophy concentration is designed for students who seek thorough training in philosophy, either as a way of acquiring reasoning and analytical skills and mastering a discipline at the undergraduate level or as preparation for graduate study. (2) The Ethics and Public Policy concentration focuses on moral and legal problems confronting the community and on the responsibilities of various professions. It is intended for a wide variety of students, including those who plan careers in law, the public sector, or medicine.
Students with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy who are interested in pursuing a California Teaching Credential should contact the credential advisor in the Graduate School of Education as soon as possible.
Undeclared students should consult with the department undergraduate advisor. Two faculty advisors and one staff advisor in the department have authority on matters such as substitutions and exceptions. The Information Sheet for Undergraduate Philosophy Majors is available in the department office; a list of courses to be offered each quarter, with specific descriptions and required texts, is available in the office and on the website before registration at:.
Prizes and Awards
Each included in the commencement program.
Senior Honors Program
Students who meet either of the following requirements may apply to join the Philosophy Department honors program:
Students are urged to apply as early as possible so that a meaningful honors curriculum can be developed at an early stage of their work in the major. Students in the honors program are expected to meet quarterly with the undergraduate advisor to discuss their progress and to plan their subsequent coursework in philosophy; in order to remain in the honors program, students are normally expected to maintain a 3.5 GPA in philosophy.
In order to graduate with distinction in philosophy, the following requirements must be met:

Ok, So what is it?
When you go to Google today, you will see something other than “Google” at the top of the page. What is it? I’ll give you three guesses:
1. Cristie Alley’s Diet plan.
2. The asphalt surface of 8th Ave. in Bozeman Montana.
3. A caricature of Donald Trumps Hair.
Actually it’s a celebration of Rudolf Hertz’s 155th Birthday today! Mr. Hertz was the German physicist who, according to Wikipedia, “clarified and expanded the electromagnetic theory.” Say what? He also invented the comb over….Ok not really. You can read more by clicking on the Google Hertz (Hz) WAVE.

How “rare” is the slave boys’ photo
A story has been circulating over the last few days about a photo of two “slave” boys, one supposedly named John, found during an estate sale in North Carolina.
The buyer was the collector Keya Morgan, whom I had not heard of before, but apparently is pretty well-known among collectors (especially for sale of the Marilyn Monroe sex tapes two years ago). According to the Associated Press story, he paid $30,000 for an album of photos of John and others (experts attributed the photo to the studio of renowned Civil War photographer Mathew Brady) and $20,000 for a bill of sale for John (from 1854).
Art historians think it’s a rare photograph of Civil War-era slave children from the 1860s. The photos and document were found at a moving sale in Charlotte in April, according to the story.
The photo presents the children and their lives in all its misery – etched in their faces and in the dusty tattered clothes they are wearing.
Practically everyone reprinted the AP story, except for blogger Kate Marcus at Before It’s News who found the same photo sold as a stereo-view card for $163 on eBay. The blogger questioned the rarity of the photo. (Stereo view card above was taken from the eBay auction site. Click on it for a fuller view.)
I also found a copy of the stereo-view card in the New York Public Library Digital Gallery, attributed to J.N. (Jerome Nelson) Wilson, who was a Savannah, Ga., photographer.
Intrigued, I decided to do some digging on my own and emailed the eBay seller. I was curious about how he/she had come across the card. He wrote back: He is a part-time Ebay seller from Connecticut with 25 years experience as an antiques and collectibles collector and estate-liquidator. He asked that I not identify him.
I’ll let him tell the story (with some minor editing):
“Since my forced retirement, I’ve had to sell off the things I’ve collected over the years (a lot of which I haven’t seen for years). One of the lots I decided to sell recently was a bag of stereo view cards and a desk top viewer I had acquired many years ago at a Wethersfield, Conn., estate sale. I sorted the cards by subject and listed them on eBay.
One of the lots of cards was a set by J.N. Wilson of Savannah, Ga., (all of the cards in the lot had ‘Photographed and Published by: J.N. Wilson’ with a Savannah address) typeset on the back. There were six views of ‘Bonaventure’ (a former plantation near Savannah). These had typeset descriptions of the plantation and the depicted view. There were two cards with handwritten descriptions titled ‘Pine Trees’ and ‘Entrance to the Park.’ (At right is a photo of the back of the New York Library stereo view card.)
Then there were the four cards titled ‘Plantation Life.’ Three had this typeset on the back of the card with a handwritten picture title. They were titled:
1. ‘Cotton Field’ (a view of a Black family standing in a cotton field with baskets of picked cotton).
2. ‘Cotton Field’ (a view of two young boys standing in a cotton field with a basket of picked cotton between them).
3. ‘Rory’s Cabin’ (a view of a family standing and sitting in front of their cabin).
4. This had a typeset title on a strip of white paper glued to the back of the card: ‘Plantation Life: Happy Little Nigs’ (this was a view of two young boys sitting on a board on a wood barrel in what looks like a sugar cane field).
This last card is identical to the ‘Brady’ card found in North Carolina with the exception that the stereo card is a wider view showing more background and the ends of the board they’re sitting on (the image would have been cropped to fit the CDV).
Here is what I know about stereo cards. They are taken with a ‘stereo camera.’ That is a camera with two lenses set about three inches apart. It takes a … picture with both lenses creating a double image. The images are of slightly different angles which when viewed through a stereo viewer creates a ’3-D’ image. The camera sees the same way our eyes see – two images when combined create perspective or depth. If you take a stereo photo of a single photo, you end up with a flat image on the photo (no 3-D effect). The only way to end up with a true stereo view is to take a stereo photo from life.
All of the J.N. Wilson cards were true stereo images (I viewed them all several times through my viewer). This means that the stereo card of those two young boys could only have been made from a live sitting.
I am convinced that all of the cards were photographed by Wilson in Georgia. I have found out that his work is known to collectors and that he operated a lucrative photography business in Savannah starting in the 1870′s.
Sugar cane was never grown in North Carolina (From Sherry: In my Google search, I found that some sugar cane was grown in coastal North Carolina but it apparently was not grown in large quantities on plantations). It was a major crop along the Georgia seaboard with several large plantations on the mainland and the outlying islands.
When I saw the North Carolina card I immediately thought about what I knew about Mathew Brady. I know that Brady did not do stereo views. I know that Brady had a reputation of commandeering other photographers’ work he liked and republishing it under his name. I know his business was faltering in the 1870′s and he published any good image he found as his own.
I was shocked to see that several ‘experts’ had authenticated the card as a Brady produced war image. Every good photography historian is intimately familiar with Brady’s catalog of work and his personal history. They should also be familiar with Wilson’s (good Southern photographers were quiet rare and the exceptions have been thoroughly studied).
How can a ‘rare, uncirculated, unpublished’ photograph of 1860′s slave children by Brady (or his associate - Timothy H. O’Sullivan) be the subject of a stereo view card by Wilson? The Brady attribution just doesn’t add up. (Photo at left from Morgan’s LincolnImages.com was circulated on the web as the one found in North Carolina.)
There needs to be a comparison made of the North Carolina card with the stereo card. I believe that the results will show that the Brady card is a reprint of half of the Wilson card (each side of the stereo card will be slightly different). This will prove that the North Carolina card is not of slave children from the 1860′s but a photograph of two poor boys from Savannah taken in the 1870′s. Still of great interest but not of the significance given it.’
I also did some more Google digging of my own on Wilson and Brady.
Wilson was born in New York in 1827 and arrived in Savannah in 1865. He was a well-known photographer in Savannah for more than 30 years, and marketed himself tremendously in the local newspaper. He produced stereo views of Bonaventure Cemetery and other sites in the city, steamers in Florida, black chimney sweeps in Savannah, Fort Pulaski in Georgia, the Green House in Macon, Ga., rice fields, orange groves, camp scenes, fishing parties and more. His works are in the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the New York Public Library Digital Gallery.
Brady is renowned for his photographs of the Civil War and portraits of Abraham Lincoln and practically all of the other presidents. He also photographed J.H. Rainey, the first African American member of the House of Representatives. His portraits are in many collections, including the National Portrait Gallery, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Musee d’Orsay in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art.
As his eyesight failed, Brady sent out teams of photographers to capture the war, according to several websites. He also purchased photos from other photographers and stamped them “Photograph by Brady,” without giving many of them credit – to the rancor of those photographers. A photo of the Lakota Chief Red Cloud was taken by Brady photographer Alexander Gardner in 1872 at the studio.
Despite what the experts said, I also found photos from the Civil War era of slave children, including this one by O’Sullivan and this one from Virginia.

Fantastic article, Sherry! I’m so happy that more people are being made aware of this incredible story.
- Kate Marcus
That’s very interesting. Thanks Sherry.
Great article, I am J N Wilson’s great granddaughter and have been collecting stereoviews of his for a few years now, and was the bidder that got outbid with one second left on the ebay collection with this card in it.
Then a few days later saw the article in the paper about the sale of the cdv. and knew that it was J N’s stereoview. In past searches of J N, I had seen this card in the New York Public Library collection. Thanks for the info……
Thanks for writing, Tina, and for providing additional information. This has been a very interesting story, and I was very happy to find out more about your great-grandfather through my Google search.
Excellent & fasinating research Sherry. As a former B&W lab tech in Washington, DC I was given a box full of late 1870′s – early 1900′s glass negatives to clean, preserve & contact print. Your article brings back the thrill of handling history. Thanks for your historical due diligence.
Thanks, Bruce. Those stereo-view cards (and the wooden viewers) & negatives come up at auction often and I always bid on them. Unfortunately, there are other bidders who want them just as much as I do, and they always outbid me. I figure I’ll get lucky at some point and win one of those bids.

wow. i have to say, i am impressed. from ramshackle seaside event to slick sunny extravaganza, The Loerie Awards finally grew into all its potential this time round. i think one’s experience of the awards depends on a number of factors, including where you’re staying, who you’re with, etc. This year we stayed slap bang in the middle of Margate in the flats about the Rondevoux Mall, which made access to shops, the beach and ceremony exceptionally easy, and thus we had a great weekend. the weather in Margate was sheer perfection – not muggy, very sunny and the water was warm and swimmable, so i managed to fit in a mini seaside holiday in the off-time. the rest of the time was spent catching up with people i haven’t seen in ages, which is a large part of what makes going so much fun. here are some of my pics, i will add a few more later. oh, and here’s the link to the saturday winners and the sunday winners.
before we left, we made a whole bunch of enlarged Jason faces. Jason works with us in client service, and in his spare time he is a paramedic and a bit of a dork. we like to make fun of the fact that he never doesn't pull a blue steel face in photos. we also like to make fun of his 'Safety First' policy.
We even got Jason to stop freaking out long enough to embrace his faces in a totem pole formation.
We made the Mugg & Bean waiters quite nervous.
Digital won a whole bunch of awards on Saturday night, which made people say things like "We really need to get into digital,". Hmm. Rather late than never, I guess.
I was really impressed by the various screens on the stage. A vast improvement from just 2 screens with a barely legible powerpoint presentation on it. This actually looked good, and you could see the work, which is what we were there for, after all.
More stage prettiness.
Arguably the biggest awards (Television Grand Prix) went to King James for the Allan Gray ad, "Beautiful". I think they deserved it.
This is an action shot I managed to capture during our Friday night braai in Margate. At some point someone threw breadrolls, which resulted in a fully fledged food fight. Here we have a precious shot of the tomatoes landing on Michael's head.
Me and Jean, who is now a designer at Grid.
Christian, Brandt and me. Thunda.com was everywhere, capturing the memories you'd rather not have.
Rei and Mark on the beach, where we found respite from the loud and bad house music at BackLine.
Looking a little sunburnt, I found Jen lurking at the back of Backline.

Gordons Bay – My Hometown
September 28, 2010 | Filed Under Family | 2 Comments
With the recent Challenge at DSA for the Established Designer Contest I had to create a kit that showcases my home town. Well although I do live in Napa, CA and it is very beautiful here my heart still yearns for home – Gordons Bay. Also most of my family also lives there so there is more than enough reasons for me to miss it so much!
So I decided to share some pictures of the Town and Surroundings. These were the last photos I took before we left in 2008…so very Nostalgic to me.
Chrismari is ready for the beach…sunglasses in hand!
View towards the Naval Base and Old Harbor. Simons Town is far in the distance.
View Towards the Old Town and Shopping Center…lots of Restaurants and Shell Shops. Great place to go for a stroll.
Harbor Island in the Distance.
Footprints…aaah I so miss these moments!
Park Bench overlooking the sea.
More of the old town…
Kitty and the Penguins…look how tiny she was here! Only 3 years old…man oh man, where has the time gone?
View from the Main Beach…if you look closely you will see ‘Moeder Maria’ i.e. Mother Maria. It is the back of Table Mountain aptly named after Jan Van Riebeeck our founding father’s wife.
Beautiful NG Church..lots of Weddings are held here in these scenic surroundings.
Last one of the old town and the Majestic Hottentots Holland Mountains in the background.
Need I say more? I hope you enjoyed these pictures. It did my heart good to share it. Thank you for stopping by!

Christian is a sleeper…anywhere and everywhere is a comfy spot to just catch a few minutes of shut eye.
Just yesterday he had 3 different spots, first on the floor – not very comfortable so he crawled onto the lazyboy. Now he was in prime position with his face all smooshed up and those baby lips begging for a kiss from Mommy.
I love his little bum bum sticking out like that! Aaawhhh!
And lastly onto his favorite position which looks so much more comfy to me too!
I love this so much…he is so like his Mommy, I just wish I could curl up next to him and nap! But how will I ever take photos?
Chrismari not wanting to be outdone ‘posed’ for me, pretending to be asleep.
lol! Not for long this little busybody of mine was up and running around before I could even put the camera away. She loves to play with her Strawberry Shortcake dolls and is telling me that this year she wants to dress up as Strawberry Shortcake (again!) for Halloween. Hmmm…already wondering about what we will do this year. I saw Target had some great costumes for only $20 – need to do a Target trip soon.
Cellphones and Keys are the BEST TOYS EVER! I think they win the award for BEST TOY found around the house each year. But really dont you just think this little man is so cute looking like a big boy with his phone?
I have been having so much fun editing these photos…although they are not the greatest (most of them are blurry) I used the Pioneer Woman’s Actions (Thanks Nicole for the suggestion!) for these photos and I just love the darling effects! Thanks for looking!
Eek! And I totally forgot to add look what is growing in my garden…
Yay I am so excited after months nagging DH I want Heirloom Tomatoes (They are soooo Divine!) we found a plant and just as it was sprouting some really cute tomatoes Chrismari picked it for her fruit salad. I just hope she stays away from this one!
The Christmas Countdown…

Oh yes it has officially started…Christmas time is almost upon us!
I want to do some Photo CD’s to send to my family back home, just a recap of our year and brainstormed this template. You can print it out and use the lines version to create a card out of scrapbooking paper or you can do it on your computer. You can get the template HERE
So I used Jolly by Golly by Cosmo Cricket to make these cards. Isn’t that snow man the cutest? I just traced the original snow man onto some cardstock and pop dotted him on the card. I had the perfect brads to do the eyes but they were bronze so I used a permanent marker to color them in. I am very happy with the results!
Oh and I just loved the cute remark at the bottom of the paper strips and used it for my cards! Its is so adorable!
I am currently without a camera since a certain sweetie pie ‘accidentally’ broke it! lol! But I have a Christmas House and a Christmas Planner to share…so hopefully next week I will have some pretty pictures for you!
Lastly I will leave you with the ‘before’ shots…of our planned (but due to circumstances i.e. a broken camera
lol…I know I know!) Christmas Shoot. I am crossing my fingers we will have some really good Christmas Photo’s as soon as the mail man has been here! Ha ha! I cannot wait…a very early Christmas present for me!

Toe maak ons wors…
June 15, 2009 | Filed Under Christiaan, Family, Recipes | 1 Comment
We made our very first batch of ‘Boerewors’ today. It is a pure beef sausage regarded as an everyday staple back home in South Africa. Trust me if you have carnivore in the house (like I do…it is something that will be missed!).
So onto the recipe and how easy it actually is to prepare:
Ouma Hessie se Boerewors
- 3 kg Beef (We used Chuck and Brisket)
- 500g Pork Fat
- 50 ml Whole Coriander
- 150 ml Brown Vinegar (Substitute with Red wine Vinegar)
- 150 ml Worcestershire
- 25 ml Salt
- 5 ml Fresh Crushed Black Pepper
- 9 g Sausage Casings
Dry Roast the Coriander in a frying pan (do not spray or add oil) until it turns a light brown. Crush the spices with a mortar and pestle.
Cut the meat into pieces to fit into your meat grinder. Coarsely grind it together.
In a flat large container mix all the ingredients together making sure the meat is very well mixed with the spices, vinegar and worcestershire sauce.
Clean the Sausage Casings by running water through them.
Fit your sausage making tube to your grinder and feed the meat mixture into a sausage casing.
Look at DH…he sure does enjoy these!
It is preferable to let it stand overnight but if you cannot wait to test it out put it on the grill and enjoy!
perfect on the grill or even as a weeknight dinner with some good old mashed potatoes or even some ‘Pap en Sheba’.
Hope you try this one out!

Well hello again! I just wanted to share my awesome find this weekend. We went out for some breakfast and came back with this…
Finally after more than a year I have furniture in every room in the house…that was probably the hardest thing for me not having all the stuff I have gotten used too, I know I cannot complain we are so blessed. And I think waiting actually paid off. We got this set for $ 500 which is a lot but it is an 8 seater with the extensions, a special cover to protect the table and 2 bookcases. Not really my color but I must say even though it still looks bare I think after I jump in and add some pretty curtains and a nice table runner and some more photos along the fireplace it will look quite snazzy!
Also I have been so busy the past few weeks with some hybrid goodies…but this is such a sweet and fast project that is a sure fire winner! I know that once you have made one you will be hooked! lol! Literally!

we get older, it becomes more and more important to take good care of our health. Seniors can stay healthy, energetic, and active for many years by establishing and maintaining healthy lifestyle habits.
Eating the right food in the right amounts is fundamental to your health. It is also a joy to eat a variety of healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean meats. You do not have to eat foods you dislike, and you do not even need to skip snacks when you crave them. The key is making healthy choices and balancing occasional splurges with more moderate eating. It is important to be thoughtful about how you eat, to know what foods are good for you, and to plan the types of foods you will buy and eat on a regular basis.
The wise senior enjoys regular moderate activity. Regular exercise can give you more energy, help you sleep better, improve your mood, boost memory and concentration, and reduce your risk of developing chronic health conditions. There are many ways to exercise. The key is to find activities that you enjoy. Starting slow is okay, particularly if you have not exercised in a long time. In a short time, you may find that exercising is one of your greatest pleasures. Exercise is particularly important for seniors, because without it, our muscles atrophy and we lose mobility.
Maintaining a healthy weight and refraining from smoking are also foundations of a healthy lifestyle.
If you eat well, exercise every day, maintain a healthy weight, and do not smoke, you will feel good, have fewer health problems, live longer, and enjoy a better quality of life.
Eating well
Often, our appetites change as we get older. You may find yourself skipping meals or not paying as much attention to what you eat. But in our senior years, it is particularly important to eat well. If we fail to nourish ourselves properly, we will lose energy much more quickly and our health may suffer. For example, if we do not eat enough of the right minerals such as calcium, our bones will lose strength and we may develop osteoporosis. As seniors, we should carefully plan a healthy diet that we can enjoy and stick to.
Staying physically active
Regular exercise is something everyone should do throughout their lifetime. Exercise will help you stay healthy and maintain the best possible quality of life. Exercise is particularly important for seniors, because without it, our muscles atrophy and we lose mobility. No one is "too old" to exercise. You should not strain or push yourself too hard, but especially if you have been sedentary for a long time, it is important to start moving. Even a little bit of exercise can greatly improve your health.
Maintaining a healthy weight
As you get older, you may notice changes in your appetite and weight. Maintaining a healthy weight is important for healthy aging. To stay healthy and manage your weight, make regular exercise and healthy eating a part of your routine. Being underweight, overweight, or obese can negatively affect your overall health.
Aim for regular physical activity each week. It is never too late to start being active. Walking and tai chi are great forms of exercise for seniors. Start slowly, pace yourself, and build up over time.
Aim for eating at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day to manage your weight and to decrease your risk of diabetes, cancer, coronary heart disease, and many other conditions.
Quitting tobacco
Longtime smokers can benefit from quitting at any age. Quitting tobacco is one of the best things you can do for your health. Your body will become healthier within days after quitting.
Kaiser Permanente offers a range of quitting tobacco classes and programs free to members. Call or visit your local Health Education Department or browse this website for more.

Texas Woman Gives Birth To Two Sets Of Identical Twins
Call it twins times two. A Texas woman gives birth to two sets of identical twin boys in a Houston hospital. Tressa Montalvo says the pregnancy was a lot better than what she expected.
The 36-year-old mom delivered the four brothers via c-section at Women's Hospital of Texas on Valentine's Day. She says she didn't use fertility drugs and the hospital says such an event is a one in 70 million chance. Montalvo gave birth to Ace and Blaine first, with Cash and Dylan coming into the world a minute later. She and her husband Manuel also admit they still want a girl.
The boys names start with A, B, C and D. If they have a girl, maybe her name will start with an E ?!?

Day #2 of 25
Imagine the time and place – Biblical times; a man and woman are promised in marriage. Back then, there was handfasting – a couple was handfasted for 1 year but did not consummate the marriage until that year was up. This allowed a couple to get to know each other and to prepare themselves for living together.
Imagine yourself as Joseph. You are male, you have pride, you are preparing your home for your wife, for when she leaves her father’s house and comes into yours. Your wife is a virgin, as is expected in those times. Possibly, even you are a virgin. You expect that she will become yours, that you will be the only one to hold her, to care for her, to father her children. You are an honorable man and you expect your wife to be honorable in return. Then you learn the truth – she is pregnant. You have honored her and not lain with her before the appointed time, but she is pregnant. The child is not yours. What a blow you receive!
I am amazed that despite all this, Joseph still cared enough for her that even though he could have her now – not after she dishonored herself and him – but nevertheless, he chose to make sure she was not disgraced by this. He would put her aside, yes, but he would do so quietly. Then God sent his angel with a message for Joseph.
I wouldn’t be overly shocked if Joseph had thought this message to be ridiculous! A baby, born of a so-called virgin, by the Holy Spirit???!!! Nevertheless, thank God, Joseph received that message from the Lord and believed it! Instead of putting her aside he took her into his home and further honored her by not laying with her until after Jesus was born. He gave the child his name and his heritage. He named the child and raised him as his son.
It’s interesting, this example. Many families today are “blended” – a blend of the wife’s and husband’s children from previous relationships. This example, right here, is a big hint to those father’s raising children not of their blood. If Joseph could take in Mary’s child and raise him as his own, then what stops men from doing the same with the children they encounter in their lives today? All right, yes, this was the Messiah we’re talking about – pretty special kid – and Joseph did receive a message from the Lord’s angel – and how many of us get that nowadays – but a child is a child, Messiah or not. Each child has the capacity to change the world. Maybe they won’t die for the world’s sins, but they can cure cancer, find a way to feed billions, save the life of their father. What will be different in your life if you, as a step-father (or step-mother) choose not to love that child as your own? What will be different in your life if you do?
Thank you Lord Jesus,
for the fulfillment of your promises and our salvation in the form of Yourself, walking on this earth, in fleshly form. Though I cannot, at this moment, think of a request You have made of me recently that I find ridiculous, should I remember one, help me to leap in with both feet. Even if the request isn’t ridiculous (to my mind), help me to follow all of your requests.
Thank You,
Amen.

Peter and I haven’t been to Nobu IN YEARS, but we used to love going to Matsuhisa (also in the Nobu family) on dates when we first met. As a matter of fact, it was in Matsuhisa’s dining room where my sweet husband proposed to me back in 1994.
While reading a recent issue of Bon Appetit magazine, I was pleasantly surprised to read that Nobu (in Los Angeles) was on a list of America’s Top 10 Sushi Spots.
Bon Ap’s Andrew Knowlton wrote:
“Twenty-two years after he launched a raw-fish revolution with his restaurant Matsuhisa, pioneering chef Nobu returns to America’s capital of sushi and opens another branch of his empire. Expect all the trademarks—Hollywood A-listers, cutting-edge design, and signature dishes, including yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, black cod with miso, and rock shrimp tempura with butter ponzu.”
We had a wonderful evening rediscovering why we fell in love with Nobu’s food (way back when), and also reminisced about those precious date nights too!
Nobu sign (in front), Shishito Peppers and Edam
21 Responses to Nobu
There’s something inherently sexy about raw fish on a plate. I don’t know what it is, but it gets me every time.
Please tell me Peter punched a TMZ photographer.
The paps were going to punch me because I took photos of their faces. It was funny because I was already in the car and one said “TMZ does NOT take this lightly”. It’s a GREAT photo too… he’s just giving me the dirtiest look, but I don’t need the headache (by posting it)!
Peter “black bar’d” them for me! Just like TMZ!!
Wait a minute… the TMZ guys don’t like having people harass them by taking pictures of them??
Hilarious right? I’m a fan of the show, but these guys were sort of SCARY.
Peter “black bar’d” them for me! Just like TMZ!! LOL
A night out in L.A. just isn’t complete without a paparazzi sighting! Your dinner looks fabulous. I’ve been to Nobu in Vegas and NYC, but have yet to go to our local branch. Someday soon hopefully!
The Miso Glazed Black Cod looks so delicious.
This Matsuhisa’s dining room must be real special for you guys if Peter proposed to you there. How Beautiful and romantic!
xo
Where else would we get engaged but at a RESTAURANT? LOL! X
Nobu looks excellent! I would love to eat there when I go to LA next time.
Nobu’s is awesome, they get everything right, every time. Awesome about having the proposal there!
Question: what do the shishito peppers taste like?
I loved the grilled shishito peppers. Not as spicy as I thought they would be, and a little bit sweet!
I just went for the first time. I hate to admit how truly delicious I thought it was-but there is actually something utterly scrumptious to the hype. I have been dreaming of the whitefish tiradito and the ginger crusted scallops I had
I love that I can live vicariously through you. At the moment we are living in the middle of nowhere, we are making the best of it, but exciting it is not. You are a great story teller and have fun no matter where you are, I love that!
When I am in town I will definitely be asking you for recommendations!
Kristen, When you’re in town we have to go eat TOGETHER!
And thank you for your kind words. I really appreciate it!
Great post. The food looks incredible as it only can at Nobu – like another reader I have been to the Vegas Nobu but not L.A. Love that it was your proposal resto! Makes total sense. Those peppers look ones we ate in Barcelona – I may have to ask you more about them. And your tangle with the paps! Luv it!!
I want to make those Shishito peppers at home. I bet I can find them at 99 Ranch!
It all looks great but the Rock Shrimp Tempura with the spicy aioli looks fantastic!
So was it worthy of the Top 10 list?
Well…. I haven’t been here YET!
Well what are you waiting for?!?

Mizuno Wave Universe Review Update @MizunoRunning
Seven weeks since I wrote the last review on my Mizuno Wave Universe (WU) last. Now over 210 miles on WU4 and 190 miles on WU3, they are still going strong! Since many people are looking for a shoe review on WU and they seem to be concerned about its durability, I thought of writing a quick update. I mostly run on pavement (concrete or asphalt), so below should be representative of its durability as many people wear racing flat on pavement (right?), rather than strictly on track or soft trail. I’ve been running in WU4 on dry days and in WU3 in rainy days.
At 210 miles, my WU4s are showing some tear and wear at the outside of the mid-foot: The black rubber-ish material you see in the picture on the left. I don’t know how many more miles are left in the material until mid-sole starts showing. The same deterioration is found on my other shoe; however, the same material on the front and inside still looks as good as new – almost.
The outsole is still securely and tightly glued to the upper, and shows no sign of coming apart. This is the case all around the shoe. The same goes for WU3 I put through some wet weather, as well as washing machine and manual washing. One thing I noticed was I got a wet foot when I accidentally step on a mushy grass. As a result, I got a big blister exactly where the outsole is wearing out. I don’t know if the water came through the thinning outsole or the opening in the middle of outsole (I don’t know what it is called).
The orange thermal plastic that runs from heel to midfoot shows a little bit of damage as well, but nowhere near as bad as the outside of the midfoot. I guess I am not a serious heel-striker. This thermal plastic material is pretty springy, so it is supposed to help when I am pushing off and moving forward.
Overall, the shoes are still in a great shape. Except for picking up dirt stain, there is no functional damages in the upper. My feet are pretty wide, but they adjusted to the width of my feet and hug my feet every time I lace up. I am not showing WU3 but their upper does not have any damages, except it shows the dirt and stains much more due to its color.
I will write another update in additional 100 miles or so.

Does anyone want to meet at the Conference to talk about alternative education issues?
Kind of late to suggest this, but...
I will be at the conference in Mount Pleasant on October 4th, 5th and 6th. Is anyone interested in meeting there as a group (or individually) to discuss alternative education issues? If so, please email me and we can arrange to meet.
Ken Willison, Alternative Education Liaison to MASSP;
President of Michigan Alternative Education Organization (MAEO)
Middle School Science Fair
I have a teacher in my building who wants to organize a 7th grade science fair for the first time. Does your middle school have a science fair? If so, I was hoping to have my teacher connect with your science teachers who sponsor/organize your science fair.
Please email me if you can help!
Thanks,

Do you have an exam exemption policy at your school?
We have had a policy in place for several years that rewards good attendance (with a few other stipulations). They can exempt one exam of their choice if they qualify. I'm wondering if this is allowed under the new graduation requirements?
Recommendations for professional development/teacher training for Connected Math.
I am looking for well qualified training for my 6th grade and 7th grade teachers for the Connected Math series. Any information would be greatly appreciated.
Who among us has alternative education responsibilities or interests?
Please help MASSP's new alternative education liaison, Ken Willison, gain a clearer understanding of who among us has alternative education responsibilities or interests. If you have any duties in your district related to alternative education ... or if you just have a strong interest in alternative education issues ... please let Ken know who you are. If you prefer not to post to the internet, please feel free to send an email to him at ken.willison@staff.spartaschools.org
Also, if you haven't done so already … why not join the new Alternative Education group? While not much has been posted there yet, we hope to get the ball rolling soon and would love to have all interested parties participate.
Thanks.
Student Age Limitations?
At what age can we stop educating a regular education student that lives in the district? What does the law state?
Any H. S. have experience with Title I Targeted Assistance planning?
Moving to Title I Targeted Assistance program in order to receive more funding to develop intervention classes/programs to help struggling students in mathematics and ELA. Looking for high schools who have successfully navigated the Title I application and have implemented an intervention structure to help reach at-risk students.
Cell Phones as Instructional Tools
I am currently working with a company to develop and pilot a new program for teachers that would allow them to utilize student cell phones to aid in instruction. Our program would primarily use the phone's text messaging feature. Some functions of the program would include student surveys, quizzes and tests, real-time brainstorming, and picture and video galleries. It would be web-based so schools would simply pay a subscription fee and get a log-in. We are thinking about purchasing some pay-as-you-go cell phones for students to use who do not have text messaging service on their phones.
What do you see as the pros and cons of a program like this? I'm curious to get your feedback.
9th Grade Center?
Does anyone currently operate and have success with a "school within a school" model specifically for the 9th grade population? If so, I would like to possibly arrange a visit to your school.
Thank you,

Are you a Class A High School that requires students to have Student ID Cards?
Midland's school improvement team is looking for information from other Class A schools regarding school identification cards (or name tags) for students. We would like to know how many schools use them, in what capacity they are used, and consequences for not having them.
Senior class trip
Do you still offer senior class trips and what are the guidelines for the trip.
PLAN & EXPLORE Testing
Good morning,
I am looking for data that supports implementing the EXPLORE test in 8th/9th grade and the PLAN test in 10th grade. If possible, I am also looking at the cost of the two programs as it relates to their actual impact on ACT test scores.
Thank you,

HYBRID SCHEDULE (80/90 min. & 45/55 min. Classes)
I am looking for schools who may currently run a hybrid schedule. We currently run a block/semester schedule but are looking to alternatives.
Particularly, I am looking for schools who may run 80-90 minute classes for either a semester or a year long. At the same time, I am looking for classes within the same schedule that run for 45-55 minutes for either a semester or for the entire year.
If you currently run a hybrid schedule combining block classes and 45-55 minute classes, I would appreciate the time to speak/meet with you to discuss the intricacies of how you schedule students and what type of program you use to do it.
We are exploring new avenues in terms of serving our student population. Any information would be a tremendous help.
Has anyone purchased a cell phone jammer for your school so that students can not use their cell phones in school?
One of our teachers heard about this device on Channel 1. We want to know if anyone is currently using this device and if so, how is it working?
plagiarism
I know it is becoming in issue with cutting and pasting off of the internet, so my staff and I are looking for some good language to put into our student's handbook regarding plagiarism. If you have something out there that has been working for you, and you are willing to share, it would be most appreciated.

How Important Is It To Follow Your Passion When Creating A Business?
Do what you love . . .
. . . And as Marsha Sinetar says, “the money will follow.”
Her book is a classic on finding what floats your boat and making a living from that. What if you don’t know what you love? That’s a problem. But not an insurmountable one.
In a story called “The Kiss of Death Marketing” in an issue of an affiliate marketing magazine, the number 1 “kiss of death” is, “Assuming that if you do what you love, the money will follow.” It goes on to say, “Steer clear of gurus who tell you to follow your passions.”
Good thing I’m not a guru, because if there’s no passion driving us toward our goals, what’s the point?
Fredric Lehrman, a prosperity guru, addresses this question in a unique and playful way with what he calls Prosperity Scrabble. To explain it, I’ll give you my own experience.
In 1997, when I was at a career crossroads, I wanted to identify my “right livelihood.” What was in me that would feed my soul? After listening to Prosperity Consciousness, I found a tool to figure it out.
Lehrman recommends doing this as a game with other people. We used this as an assignment in our guy group to report on our experience.
Here are the steps:
- Cut up pieces of paper into approximately one-inch squares
- Write down something you really enjoy doing on each one. This could include mundane things like watching TV. But be thorough and don’t censor your thoughts
- Turn them over so you can’t read them, mix them up and pull out two
- Take item 1 and item 2, seemingly unrelated, and try to envision a business from combining them
If you find a combination that clicks, he says, ask yourself if you’re willing to do it until you make $100. When I was doing this process, two items came to the top:
- Motorcycle riding
- Travel journalism – writing and photography
Pondering those items, and a life-long desire to travel the U.S. by motorcycle, I came up with my all-time favorite business plan. I shopped it all over Atlanta for a year and came very close to getting a major corporation to fund the entire year of travel. Now, years later, because of technology improvements and because of what I’ve learned about doing business online, I don’t need a corporate sponsor.
It’s still a major goal of creating a successful business on the Internet is to take this trip and make the project a reality.
We haven’t yet taken the trip, but we’re getting closer. Prosperity scrabble helped me realize what was important and how to feed my soul.
The rest of this module is about choosing niches in your passion areas (or otherwise) that are worth doing. Pay close attention to these technques.

Why Your Mindset Is What It Is…And What You Can Do About It!
In 1998, I went on my first and only blind date.
I had been resisting it for 3 months, but the mutual friend who set up the date was persistent, to say the least.
Blind dates! How . . . Pitiful! Is this what my life had come to? I was so judgmental about the whole concept, but the truth was that my resistance was because this woman sounded like someone I could easily be interested in.
The last thing I wanted was a serious relationship. I had been married (didn’t work out so well) and swore I’d never do it again!
I walked into a little outdoor café for the 1-hour pre-arranged cup of coffee with the obligatory hard-stop. Of course, I had created another appointment to make sure I had an excuse to leave. And there sat a beautiful, intelligent and very direct 40-year old woman.
The conversation was quick.
“Are you Charlsa?” She nodded, “You’re David?” I nodded and took a seat across from her.
After the briefest awkward pause, she looked at me and blurted out, “So, what’s your story?”
I cracked up. I loved her directness. And ended up loving her.
As my wife would say, “What’s your story?”
That really is the purpose of this entire course. We want to tell our stories, convince people to buy our products and create a community around both. Whether you’re a writer, a business person, an athletic trainer, a hobbyist, a realtor, or someone who wants to escape the life you’ve built so far, you’ve got to have a story. And that story is your experience. It’s your wisdom.
It’s an asset!
Introductions are in order.
Hi, I’m David Perdew.
But you know that already. I have a long and checkered history. If you want the resume version, I’ll post it later. But the bullets are:
- Born: New Castle, IN., 1952, in a loving but flawed working class family (aren’t they all?)
- Lived there till I was 18 when I joined the Air Force
- Married when I was 19
- Three children (all over 30 — Good Lord, how did I get so old!)
- Graduated from Indiana University in Journalism in 1978
- Divorced 1984
- Worked in the newspaper business as a photo editor, magazine editor and copy editor until 1989. Left the Atlanta Journal & Constitution in 1989 as Director of Photography
- Started my stock photography agency in 1989
- Married again in 1990
- Sold stock agency in 1995
- Divorced again in 1996
- Changed careers to information technology in 1996 as a programmer
- Became a project manager / consultant in 1997
- Sold my car and bought a 1997 Harley Davidson in 1997 as my only mode of transportation for two years
- Married again in 1998
- Spent 20 years as a successful independent corporate consultant
Ok, there’s my life boiled down to 16 facts — but that’s only part of my story.
Here’s my story
A big part of my story is about money. It’s the measure of success in this country. I was sucked into that vortex for years. The larger my checkbook balance, the better I felt. If it was close to (or God forbid – below) zero, I went into a depression. Not because I had money problems, but because my self-worth was tied directly to the number of zeros following the number 1. It was insane.
And it finally took me the only place it could – all the way to the bottom. The bullet that says “Divorced again in 1996” is directly tied to that bottom. My beliefs about money were driving my life.
My mindset was my biggest struggle. That’s why I think it SO important to focus on our mindset from the start. We’ll attack those beliefs – mine and yours – in a later section today.
Here’s the blessing in that crash: There’s an unexpected freedom at the bottom.
It becomes a reference point never to be forgotten for the rest of your life. It becomes a touchstone for gratitude. When times are rough, I tell myself, “Whew, I’m so grateful I’m not there any longer.” And I know that I never have to go back. But I also know that no matter how difficult things get, I can survive.
That’s a great discovery! Much of the fear that drove my life lessened, if not disappeared. Fear of loss, fear of not being enough, fear of disappointing others – all became my reality, no longer imagined. I experienced loss, not being enough and truly disappointed many others. And there’s such freedom in knowing that from the bottom you can only go up!
The greater gift is knowing that you get to choose your bottom. You don’t have to be penniless and homeless like I had become. You can say that from today forward, I’ll go no lower. I accept responsibility for my life.
The key to an incredible mindset – and business – is personal responsibility!
My life is a pure gift that has continually improved since 1995. Astounding things have happened. Great miracles and wonderful opportunities. Sounds like I’ve got it licked now? Not by a long shot, but I do have a perspective on my life that is huge and that I’m very comfortable with.
I haven’t had a real paycheck since 1989.
A paycheck is a trap. It makes you think the world will protect and save you. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Joe Vitale says in The Attractor Factor (go ahead and buy the book – I’ll reference it a gazillion times):
“The hardest concept for most people to grasp is that they are the sole reason they are experiencing whatever they have in their lives. They are totally responsible.”
Whew! He didn’t say partially responsible. He didn’t say one of the reasons. Don’t look around. He’s talking to you. He said you are responsible for whatever you have in your life.
Yes but . . .
Stop right there. This is a key concept. That’s what every bottom-dweller learns, or they stay on the bottom.
I am responsible for changing my life.
No one else is.
And I can only change one life – mine. Not my wife’s, my son’s, my parents’ or my boss’s. Changing my life is my business. It’s my job and it’s my only job.
MyNAMS training is built around this concept. Memorize it! Cut it out and put it on your refrigerator.
This web business stuff is not easy. It’s simple. But not easy.
Don’t let anyone kid you. Without persistence, nothing will happen. This is a business and must be treated like a new business. That’s what the entire MyNAMS Step-by-Step training is all about: Helping you move from beginner to advanced online business person.
We’ll be thorough, sometimes too thorough. The structure of this course is such that you can attack any topic at anytime, but we really encourage you to go through it methodically from start to finish.
Now, tell me who you are
Go to the forums and introduce yourself if you haven’t already. If you’ve given us the facts, we want more.
- What do you do?
- Who do you love?
- What’s important to you?
- Where do you live? (Not looking for a street address, just a part of the world
)
- What do you want from this course?
I loved reading your story. I relate to it so much. Firstly, thank you for taking my call a few weeks ago. The fact that I could call you directly and you answered… wow, I can’t tell you how cool that was. As we discussed, I wanted to join MyNAMS.com, but needed some direction. I was also hoping to get the lifetime membership I missed out on… doesn’t hurt to ask, right? Well, I joined MN and signed up to a bunch of free things and started getting emails… tons of emails. I was completely overwhelmed! I can’t tell how excited I am about the Dashboard. It’s exactly what I need… an easy-to-navigate step-by-step course. Thank you soooo much!
I too am a journalist, now working as a consultant. Specifically, I was a magazine editor who had a very successful career. But I found myself longing to do more, be an entrepreneur, which lead me to an awful experience that became my bottom. Once I extricated myself for the situation, and took back my life, I entered a year-long journey of self discovery that lead me to launch my blog. I’m clear that everything that happens in life is a lesson, whether it be a good or hurtful experience. As difficult as it was to go through the fire, today I live an more grounded and grateful life. My income is 25% of what it used to be but I’m 100% happier. I’m having fun not taking life too seriously and appreciate every moment of every day. All of which has lead me to launching. My blog has enriched my relationship with my mother… and my waistline. I’m excited about taking it to the next level. Thank you for being part of my journey. Angela Lawrence
Angela – thanks for telling us your background. These are amazing times we live in
I’ve been out of journalism – officially – since 1989, but I really believe all those skills are absolutely crucial to doing what we do online today. I think you’ve got a big advantage having that in your history. And I loved talking to you about your partnership with your mother on your site. Great concept…Look forward to seeing you in Atlanta at the workshop (if you can make it…)
Just finished reading your story. Amazingly, much like mine.
Made me cry.
I guess I’ve found the right place
Love it.
Glad you found us Bonnie… Didn’t know it was such a touching story, but I just tell it like I see it
I’m a blessed man.
I relate to alot of your story and look forward to one day meeting face to face and maybe breaking a little bread with you. Not this February workshop but the next. I’m making it one of my goal’s.
I won’t post my personal travails here because they are very personal and hurtful to some extent. A lot of stuff that I am still working through with the help of my shrink. I am almost 70 years old and it was not until recently that I found the courage to get the help I needed. I was raised in a culture where men stand on their own, even if they haven’t the feet to do so, if you get my drift.
Just like with NAMS, I had not had the sense to get help with my marketing. Instead I kept banging my head against the wall all by myself, following WSO’s and other products I could afford. What a waste of time and effort! I could be so far ahead of where I am and not be in the situations I find myself in now.
Oh well, can’t change history, I’ll just have to deal with my issues the best I can and keep moving forward, no matter what. At least now I’m feeling a little more confident of my future outcome.
I first joined NAMS on Nov 1 but due to some unexpected medical issues I had not had the chance to get into any of the material here. Now that I’m here I can’t believe the volume of material on this site. I am really looking forward to begin making some progress now that I am a member here. Thanks for having the HEART to create such a place.
Thanks, Alex
Alex – you’re very welcome and I hope you dig in as much as you can.
About our travails in life: I always say it takes what it takes to get us where we are. And sometimes that’s a lot of stumbles along the way. Like you’ve discovered, the best way to avoid most of that is to ask for help! And that’s a really hard thing for those of us in our “mature” state…
Welcome again.
David
Hi David,
Thank you for taking the time to create this page and for telling your story. I can relate in many ways. But here’s just a few …
I’m currently studying copywriting with Karon Thackston. Originally I was a nuclear med tech for 35 years. I love nature and the outdoors, used to bike and run for charities. And since I was in three radiology modalities, photography has always been part of my life with extra courses in college.
I’ve had several painful life experiences, but in the last few years I’ve been able to take the charge off the emotional side effects … and switch off the bad thoughts in the process. Earlier in my life, that type of help wasn’t available. What was available didn’t help. Like you, my belief is that we are definitely in charge of what happens in our own lives. It was just the “how to change it” that had me stuck. I love Dr. Joe, and also Centerpointe. Knowing something mentally and then actually believing it and acting on it are two different things … and trusting the Guidance we receive every day.
What’s important to me is to leave my affairs in order and that means making money now. I wanted what I call a “retirement career” using my writing skills productively, so I went back to college and took journalism. After another decade of life stuff including a family tragedy, I’m starting again.
I keep reminding God that I’m not Methuselah, and he keeps giving me opportunities and blessings with incentives to just keep on keepin’ on … hence, I was directed to NAMS via Karon.
I live in the midwest with a shelter dog and a 32-year old parrot adapting to ever-changing weather conditions–which is why I do my focus work late at night … for now. What I need from this course is exactly what you offer: structure and direction. But you offer so much more. I’ m flabbergasted (is that a real word?). Anyway, I’m grateful for all of it.
Blessings,
Patricia
P.S. I look forward to meeting you and the terrific NAMS team (have read some blogs) in near future.
Thanks Patricia. I’m with you on the retirement career
But I don’t feel very retired these days… Of course, I’ve got a couple more years before I want to fully retire – whatever that means – anyway…
WOW! What an eye opener.
Glad you liked it Dino
We try to keep your eyes open all the time…
Wow we are the same age, guess there is hope for me to make it in the internet world. Just finished reading and am looking forward to devouring all of the NAMS training.
Bill
Hi! I am just beginning my journey up from the bottom and am so excited to be here and learning from somone like you. Reading your story was so very inspitiational. I, too have found all the bumps in the road and knew that there had to be a better way.
I have a wonderful friend that gifted me with my membership to MyNAMS and I am now finding that it is the gift that keeps on giving.
My journey is now looking like quite an adventure. Thank you!
Not as excited as we are to have you here. New people who have a goal and drive to execute it are the lifeblood of our program. And frankly, the most fun. Watching people succeed is awesome. Make sure you go to the forum and introduce yourself. You’ll find lots of folks there who will help.
I spent a good part of a year studying programs and building a website. So many pieces to the puzzle and so many products that don’t deliver or are to hard to understand. I stepped away from the whole thing for the good part of another year after blogging my heart out and marketing and getting few results… Here I am again. Ready to get it done because I want this!!
Great post – I’m excited to meet everyone.
David, I am touched by this post and your sharing so much of yourself. I’m embarrassed to say that I’m only just digging into these Dashboard modules (on the plane en route to NAMS). So much of my entrepreneurial experience in the last three years has been backwards. I got excited about social media long before I had anything to promote or sell. I’ve learned so much from so many people, but it’s time for me to put it all together. Let the new leg of my journey begin.
Personally, in the spirit of sharing, I have been so, so fortunate in my life and marriage – John and I celebrated out 40th in October and he’s still the person I’d rather be with than anyone in the world. We have two amazing grown children who are not only happily married and employed, but doing things that make a difference in the world.
I trained to be an anatomist but took another route as wife, mother, and community activist. No regrets there. But now that the kids are out of the nest, and my retired husband is good at staying busy on his own, I have an entrepreneurial itch I haven’t scratched yet. At this stage in my life, I’m not looking to be rich and famous, but I should would like to earn enough to pay for a fabulous vacation every year.
Should I have posted all this in the forum? If so, let me know and I’ll copy and paste.
I work in construction. A decent living, stay busy, bring home a paycheck weekly. Not exactly head over heels inspired by that, nor as physically capable as I once was, so I have been exploring options.
Affiliate marketing seemed to hit all of my personal criteria buttons for a viable “retirement career” , but until now I have been stumble-bumbling along, as a green newbie. Thanks to Kaya Singer for introducing me to NAMS and you, David.
Now, I have to say, your excellent website seems a bit overwhelming , so I can see myself struggling a bit to stay focused, but it certainly has me chomping at the bit to actually see RESULTS from my efforts.
I’m ready to dive in!
Excellent Jeff – you’re only scratching the surface of this site. But I’m so glad that you’re digging in here with this series. You’ll see a bunch of tools, training and community opportunities to help you when you need it. Thanks for being here.
I’ve been a member since October, but I’m just now really getting started. My youngest was born with medical disabilities but it was December of 2011 before we learned that my oldest has a few medical challenges herself. I spent the months of November and December of 2012 (1 year later) getting her prepared for surgery (Christmas eve, of course!) and getting myself prepared for the $16,000 medication expense (not including the anesthesiologist, surgeon, hospital, etc). I lost my job at the beginning of December, but it took me until February to make the decision (no regrets) to pursue my passion (working for myself, traveling with my daughters), and until now to get back to MyNAMS. I’m sorry I missed the February session (no babysitter), but can’t (currently) afford the August one – unless I get my butt in gear and get to making things happen.
I’m disappointed that I’m starting 5 months after I joined, but it is what it is – and the BEST thing I can do is move forward, and not look back.
Here goes…

Beethoven – Für Elise:
Nice performance, I love it!!!
<|endofexample|>
Tucked into a beautiful isolated north-south valley, on the western slope of the Coast range of southern Oregon, with a clear, clean river named Middle Creek running through, is our farm. 27 acres of lush pasture and 100 year old conifer forest, barns, and a home surrounded by productive and established orchard and gardens, the land sits a mile or so below a narrows in the canyon, where tall rock walls like sentinels stand above the road and river that head up east into what old timber is left in this part of these blue-green mountains that face the sea. To the west the hills rise and fall a couple of times before the mainstem Coquille river winds it’s way lazily to the surf some 25 miles distant. A winding, scenic 20 minute drive takes you to the old town and county seat of Coquille, and another 20 minutes lands you in the second largest port on the Oregon coast, the city of Coos Bay.
Weather here is mostly wet for the months of December-March, with temperatures ranging from the 30′s to 50′s, occasionally dipping into the 20′s…occasionally snowing…then, through April and May the rains begin to taper and the sunny spells increase to remind us of the amazing summer to come. As seems to be the case is most shorter summer climates, life seems to take on a certain urgency of beauty and celebration of itself. With the mercury hovering in the 80′s to 90′s commonly during the long lazy afternoons, the swimming hole is a welcome respite. Fall can stretch out into sweet, ripe days and lingering warm, scented evenings..with crisp, starry nights when the Milky Way is like a bright brushstroke of glitter across a deep blue-black sky. When the winter rains return they are a welcome relief to the dry land and ensure the continuing cycle of fertility and fecundity.
Since I moved my young family here in 1983, this place has been farmed organically. Raising Llamas, goats, ducks and chickens, as well as the occasional turkeys, has been an on-going part of farm life and death here. By amending and composting the clay-rich earth, along with ample spring and river water and long summer days, we have sustainably raised bumper crop after bumper crop of delicious vegetables and fruits over these many seasons. Greens and herbs are grown in the greenhouse nearly year round, and the garden starts are also seeded and raised there starting with the tomatoes and peppers in February. The lath house is where the starts are “hardened off” before their risky transplant to the cool spring soil..and exposure to the lurking late frosts. As the soil warms, an eager horde of various starts join direct seedings to fill the nearly half acre veggie garden with a continuously changing show of color and form that finishes with bounty and memories..filling the pantry, food storage room, freezers and happy bellies. Apples, pears, plums, peaches, cherries, and figs join in a steady flow of fruits to fill dehydraters, cider press, wine crocks and canning jars. Berries both wild and gardened, and grapes join in as harvest moons wax large.
This land has a very long history of bounty and human involvement, in fact, thousands of years. Every time I come across a primitive tool, or implement, while working this soil, I am reminded of the earlier stewards here. They harvested, used fire to manage, and met here to scrape hides, harvest Salmon, swap stories and genes. They took good care of their world here as it took good care of them. As was the case in most all of this western land, the coming of the whites marked the ending of an era..and a gradual, then gaining momentum, destructive change took place. As the most recent steward on this bit of paradise, I have considered it my inheritance to speak for all the inhabitants of this sacred place..and hold in my hearts eye a healing..a return to the ancient rhythms that created the real wealth that was here..for all.
When I first drove down what was then the driveway, through the woods and out onto the lower pasture here, I turned to my wife and said ”This is it!” ..and it has been, since that mid-summer day. By 1990 we had undertaken a major remodel of the shack that was on the site…concluding with the addition of the dance/recording studio building. The timber-framed barn and equipment shed went up in that same period, and much garden expansion, fencing, treeplanting and landscaping was happening along with the construction. Though I divorced in 1996, with the help of the next strong women in my life, by ’05 the cobblestone walks and patios and rock-walled perennial flower gardens and orchard had been established around the house, and a bed and breakfast recording studio was open for business. Many musicians have enjoyed the creative, serene and natural atmosphere of the place..many family, friends and neighbors have enjoyed the place for it’s beauty and relaxation..and for great parties and events.

Anyone who tells children that God – literally – created the world in seven days 6,000 years ago is guilty of perverting education.
This article originally appeared on the Independent / by Susan Elkin
The truth – and education should be above all else a search for truth – is that the world, and the flora and fauna in it, including homo sapiens, evolved over millions of years.
But of course, whatever the founders of the Exemplar Academy in Newark soon to open as a state-authorised school might think, the divisions between the two points of view are not quite as cut and dried as that.
There is, for example, more than one sort of truth. There is factual, scientific truth and there are deeper, metaphysical truths.
For example, I don’t for a moment believe that Adam and Eve were ever a physically living people and neither, for the record, do any of the committed Christians I know. But there is a great deal of ‘truth’ in their human fallibility and curiosity. In a sense the Adam and Eve story is a novel, and like all the best novels it is full of insights and truths.
Intelligent, responsible adults working with children teach them the science and then, if they wish, explain that the creation stories – and every religion has one – originated as man’s way of explaining truths he ( or she) didn’t fully understand. It actually makes quite an interesting education project to explore and compare those stories and see what a lot they have in common.
And as for God. Well, he was man’s name for the almost unimaginable force which drove (drives) the process of evolution and change – a personification. So, if you want a religious approach, the science and the creation myth complement each other. You don’t have to argue the literal and pretty absurd case for an old man in the sky striding about making decisions for and about human beings.
Good educators – parents, teachers and others – ensure that children learn to think and reason for themselves. They don’t thrust propaganda and bigotry at them or withhold facts and information.
A friend of mine taught for a while in a tiny school run by Plymouth Brethren. She had to teach Shakespeare’s play Henry V so that the students could take GCSE English Literature. She was not allowed to mention sex in any context and the word ‘god’ had been blanked out of the text every time it appeared which wrought havoc with both sense and verse.
One student, a girl aged 15 (yes,15), was very puzzled about why the women were in danger at Harfleur. ‘I can see that the soldiers would want to kill the men’ she said. ‘But what on earth did they want with the women and girls?’ It seems little short of scandalous to me that anyone in 21st century Britain is raising children in such dangerous ignorance. Bigotry has a great deal to answer for.
I am not a religious believer or church goer. But I am a great admirer of much of what is in The Bible and other religious texts. They contain fine poetry, a great deal of human truth in many of the stories and an encapsulation of the cultures they sprang from and influenced – all of which I want children and young people to be led to think about. We can all learn a lot from them.
But we must never indoctrinate or permit our institutions to use indoctrination techniques. The Department for Education, as my colleague Richard Garner reported in the Independent last week is trying to make a slippery and unconvincing distinction between a school which has a ‘faith ethos’ and a ‘faith school’ .
Call it what you like but the school in question is founded by blinkered creationists who don’t see education as a free unending journey. Does anyone really believe that it will restrict itself to pedalling its distorted truths (lies?) in RE lessons?
Real Education is about open-ended questioning and challenging the mind. It also involves encouraging the learners eventually to move way beyond their teachers so that each generation explores new ground. Blinkered, limited, propagandist, religious thinking attempts to hold back or stop that process.
Brainwashing is a form of child abuse. It should have no place in any place of learning. /sources: article; image (Mattias Jordan Carson);.

. “Truth springs from argument amongst friends.” by David Hume.
Here here! Great article; it’s crazy that in 2012 our children are still having draconian morality tales presented to them as fact, in the name of ‘education’.
Let faith schools teach by all means, but don’t force everyone to have to swallow the same dogma.

It's downright hazardous how quickly this summer seems to be slipping past. Work has been keeping me fairly busy and I can never seem to satisfy my appetite for exploring Washington's trails. I'm making steady daily progress on my 1000 mile challenge but feel like I'm playing a serious game of catch up with the others. If I can keep my weekly average between 25 and 30 miles during the warmer months here in Washington, I should be able to complete the trip on time. Unless I take a wrong turn and go over a cliff like the unfortunate fellow on the sign.
I've got a couple of great trails I wanted to share this week using an online mapping tool that I'm just learning about. It seems to have a few technical kinks and isn't always super intuitive, but it's one of the better ways I've found to share trip details (at least until I break down and design my own online mapping tool that is). As always, I've also got downloadable PDF maps that you can simply print and go.
Rattlesnake Mtn Trail - 9.02 Miles
This was a great trail I hiked two weeks ago, conveniently located off I-90 at exit 32. You'll gain a significant amount of elevation in the first 1.6 miles along this high traffic section of the trail. Most hikers get winded on their climb to Rattlesnake Ledge and go no further but the 2.4 miles of trail along the northwestern ridgeline provides a surprising degree of solitude. On clear days you'll have unmatched views of Mt. Si, North Bend, and Chester Morse Lake to the southeast.
Noble Knob Trail – 7.1 Miles
I had been eyeing this ridgeline trail that borders the Norse Peak Wilderness ever since the snows let up in mid-April. I’m sure the rangers at the Enumclaw Station were wearied by my almost daily calls to find out if the road had been opened to get to the Corral Pass trailhead. With my wife, new hiking partner (Adrian), and five kids under the age of eight in tow, I was finally able to venture up to check it out this last weekend. Two of the kids actually made it the full distance out to Noble Knob and back (7.1 Miles). What can I say, “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” (Proverbs 22:6)
A Word of Caution: The trickiest part of getting to Corral Pass and the trailhead is NFD 7174. There are several sections that are extremely steep, narrow, and rocky. You'll want to be in a vehicle with sufficient horsepower and road clearance in order to make it up. Be very careful when passing other vehicles moving in the opposite direction. We actually saw a small Honda Civic that was being plucked from a dangerous embankment by a heavy duty tow truck while we were up there. The owners had the look of terror on their faces as we carefully moved past them.
Looks like some great hikes...the color of the water in the first one is amazing.
Very nice and creative blog i really love this blog Thanks for post this

I must have my own space! I must have my own time! On Sunday morning with several Masses to celebrate and sermons to preach, the last thing I need is to be rushed, without having the leisure to loosen my limbs and tune into God -after the heavy drowsiness of a good night's sleep.
And so it happened that on one Sunday morning both my usually reliable 'body clock' and my alarm clock failed to awaken me. Neither did the Holy Spirit or any of my Guardian Angels. Far be it from me to suggest that they were sleeping at their posts.
The time came when two worthy parishioners were pounding on my door and calling my name. Much was their relief to find that I was still half alive in a distant drowsy fashion. They told me I was already late and that there was no need to stampede myself into action.
In the twilight world of semi-consciousness I groped my way to the car. As I made my drowsy way down the aisle of the church I heard a small boy whisper, "Mummy, Father's still asleep!" True! True! True! With my head aching at the effort of trying to become devotional, and, harder still, to sound coherent, I would not be surprised if many in the congregation thought I was talking in my sleep as well as sleep walking.
One of today's worn out cliches is people talking about their having got their act together, at long last and after so much effort...not without moments of elation and heart-break. To reach the peak and remain at the top is an enviable achievement.
But then I pause. What if God saw it fitting for my personal formation that I should never feel totally secure, never utterly self-confident? What if throughout my life it were needful for me to be continually aware of my creaturely fragility? Then, surely if ever anything that I attempted were to"come off" just as I intended, instinctively I would say, "Thank you God, for bringing me through."
For me it simply is not true that practice makes perfect. Having been Fr. Reliable for so many years is no guarantee that I will wake up at a given time on any given Sunday. I've heard it said of some priests that they have preached so many sermons they could do it in their sleep.
Come to think of it, I remember a time when I was surging through my sermon when it seemed as though there were a power-cut in my brain. For a while my brain went blank. When I returned to the real world I wondered where I was and what I was doing. What could I do but ask an altar server what was going on? Politely he told me he thought I was preaching. Obviously I had failed to make much of an impact on him.
What to do but to tell the congregation God had shut me down for a moment, and this I took to be an indication that He wanted me to shut up. Since no one protested I suggested we recite the Creed together. This certainly restored my wavering self-confidence.
My personal experience tells me that at the very time when I'm doing something important for God, He allows me to have a "power failure" and a "black out" in my preaching. He even allows my inner being to be in a state of flux. He's teaching me never to think in terms of my performance or my personal achievement. Mine is to be the instability of a jelly and the insecurity of walking on shifting sands.
I and the People of God are to be made to realize and accept what God has to offer: Preachers and Ministers who are no better and no worse than, "earthenware pots holding a priceless treasure, so that the immensity of the power is God's and not our own,"
2 Cor. 4. 7).
It's somewhat unnerving not to know what God is liable to let happen to me once I set about doing something for Him! For the elite this may mean martyrdom. For the likes of me it may come down to a fuzzy head or loose bowels! Such is my spirituality of encountering and serving the Divine, mywaygodsway. This I must learn to live with, and, I fancy, so must you!

United States Court of Federal Claims.
LUMMI TRIBE OF THE LUMMI RESERVATION, Lummi Nation Housing Authority, Fort Peck Housing Authority, Fort Berthold Housing Authority, and Hopi Tribal Housing Authority, Plaintiffs,
v.
The UNITED STATES, Defendant.
No. 08–848C.
Aug. 21, 2012.
SUPPLEMENTARY OPINION
*1 This case arises under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self–Determination Act of 1996 (“NAHASDA” or “the statute”), as amended, 25 U.S.C. §§ 4101–4212 (2006). Plaintiffs sue here to recover grant funds originally paid to them under that statute, but later recaptured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD” or “the agency”) when HUD determined that the allocation formula on which the grants had been based had been misapplied. Defendant has moved to dismiss count two of plaintiffs' second amended complaint—a count alleging that HUD's recapture of grant funds without conducting a compliance hearing constituted an illegal exaction—on the ground that the recapture was lawfully accomplished despite the absence of such a hearing.FN1 The court heard oral argument on June 19, 2012. Because we conclude that HUD failed to follow the applicable procedures in recapturing plaintiffs' grant funds, defendant's motion to dismiss is denied.
FN1. In an earlier round of litigation in this case, defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffs' entire complaint, arguing, inter alia, that: (i) NAHASDA is not a money-mandating statute and therefore does not confer jurisdiction on this court; (ii) the Anti–Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1)(A), precludes this court from awarding the relief sought; and (iii) plaintiffs' claims are barred by the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. § 2501. In an opinion issued on August 4, 2011, we rejected defendant's first two arguments, ruling that NAHASDA is indeed a money-mandating statute whose implementing regulations may be challenged by plaintiffs in this court, and that the Anti–Deficiency Act does not prevent the court from awarding the requested relief (a conclusion that was later confirmed by the Federal Circuit in Samish Indian Nation v. United States, 657 F.3d 1330, 1339 (Fed.Cir.2011)). Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation v. United States, 99 Fed. Cl. 584, 597, 605 (2011). We accepted defendant's third argument, however, and accordingly dismissed plaintiffs' claims for grant funds relating to fiscal years 1998 through 2002 as having accrued more than six years before plaintiffs' November 26, 2008, filing of suit in this court and thus as barred by the statute of limitations. Id. at 607. We additionally dismissed that aspect of plaintiffs' complaint—count two—challenging HUD's recapture of grant funds without conducting a compliance hearing, on the ground that any failure to do so was not prejudicial. Id. at 599.
Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the court's decision. Following a hearing on the matter, the court issued an order on September 29, 2011, vacating that portion of our August 4, 2011, decision dismissing plaintiffs' second claim for relief (the claim challenging HUD's recapture of grant funds in the absence of a compliance hearing). Pursuant to the court's order, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on October 28, 2011, containing a revised second claim for relief in which they again challenge HUD's recapture of grant funds without conducting a compliance hearing. That revised second claim for relief is the subject of defendant's current motion to dismiss.
FACTS FN2
FN2. We limit our discussion to those facts relevant to plaintiffs' revised second claim for relief; a more comprehensive recitation of the facts can be found in our earlier decision. Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation v. United States, 99 Fed. Cl. 584, 587–90 (2011).
The statute at issue in this case, NAHASDA, directs the Secretary of HUD to provide annual grants to Indian tribes or tribal housing authorities in support of their need for affordable housing. The distribution of these funds is accomplished through a formula, set forth at 24 C.F.R. §§ 1000.301–1000.340, that determines the amount each grant recipient is to receive based in part on the recipient's Formula Current Assisted Stock (“FCAS”)—the inventory of rental units and lease-to-own units owned by the recipient as of September 30, 1997, the effective date of NAHASDA.
Plaintiffs have received NAHASDA grants annually since 1998. In 2001, however, HUD's Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) performed a nationwide audit of the NAHASDA program. The resulting report concluded that HUD had improperly administered the grant program by failing to exclude from the grant calculation housing units that no longer qualified as FCAS under the relevant regulations. In particular, the report criticized HUD for failing to enforce 24 C.F.R. § 1000.318, a regulation specifying that housing units are to be excluded from FCAS “when the Indian tribe ... no longer has the legal right to own, operate, or maintain the unit” so long as such units are conveyed “as soon as practicable after a unit becomes eligible for conveyance.” The OIG recommended that HUD audit all housing units included in the allocation formula, remove ineligible units, recover funding from grant recipients that had received overpayments based on ineligible FCAS, and reallocate the recovery to other NAHASDA grant recipients that had been underfunded.
*2 HUD accordingly notified a number of Indian tribes and tribal housing authorities (including all of the plaintiffs in this action) that the agency intended to recover overpaid grant funds from them. Toward this end, HUD provided plaintiffs with the applicable regulations, the guidelines explaining those regulations, and a list of the specific housing units that HUD regarded as ineligible for grant purposes. HUD additionally invited plaintiffs to review HUD's data and to supply any information that would establish the continuing eligibility of the challenged units as qualifying housing stock. HUD did not, however, conduct formal hearings on this issue.
HUD ultimately determined that since November 26, 2002,FN3 the Lummi Tribe had received $863,236 in overpayments, the Fort Berthold Housing Authority had received $249,689 in overpayments, and the Hopi Tribal Housing Authority had received $964,699 in overpayments as a result of the inclusion of ineligible FCAS in the allocation formula.FN4 Of these amounts, HUD has recaptured the entire overpayment from the Hopi Tribal Housing Authority and all but $14,029 from the Lummi Tribe and $125,399 from the Fort Berthold Housing Authority, through the offset of overpayments against underpayments and through the reduction of subsequent years' grants. Recovery of the outstanding overpayments has been identified as on hold pending the outcome of this litigation.
FN3. Pursuant to our earlier ruling on the statute of limitations, claims arising from overpayments recaptured more than six years before the November 26, 2008, filing of plaintiffs' complaint in this court are out of time.
FN4. In addition to the overpayments received by plaintiffs, HUD determined that the misapplication of the grant allocation formula had also resulted in certain underpayments to plaintiffs, specifically an underpayment of $102,312 to the Lummi Tribe, $91,921 to the Fort Berthold Housing Authority, and $381,868 to the Hopi Tribal Housing Authority. These amounts were later offset against outstanding overpayments.
DISCUSSION
I.
In count two of their second amended complaint, plaintiffs assert that HUD's recapture of overpaid grant funds through the reduction of subsequent years' grants was accomplished without legal authority and therefore amounts to an illegal exaction. Aerolineas Argentinas v. United States, 77 F.3d 1564, 1572–73 (Fed.Cir.1996) (recognizing that an illegal exaction claim may be heard in this court where a plaintiff alleges that it “ ‘paid money over to the Government, directly or in effect, and seeks return of all or part of that sum’ that ‘was improperly paid, exacted, or taken from the claimant in contravention of the Constitution, a statute, or a regulation’ ”) (quoting Eastport S.S. Corp. v. United States, 372 F.2d 1002, 1007 (Ct.Cl.1967)). Plaintiffs maintain that the exaction at issue was the direct result of a misapplication of law—specifically HUD's failure to abide by the terms of NAHASDA in recapturing plaintiffs' grant funds—and that the remedy for such violation is a return of the money unlawfully exacted. Pennoni v. United States, 79 Fed. Cl. 552, 561 (2007). Defendant has moved to dismiss count two on the ground that HUD acted properly in recapturing those funds. At the heart of defendant's motion, then, is a single question: Is HUD permitted to recover grant funds through an administrative offset, without following the procedures set forth in NAHASDA, once those grant funds have been disbursed and expended on affordable housing activities?
In plaintiffs' view, the answer is no. Plaintiffs argue that Title IV of NAHASDA, 25 U.S.C. §§ 4161–4168, provides a comprehensive and exclusive scheme for the administration of grant funds and that Congress, by setting forth the remedies available to HUD under this title, expressed its intention to bar all other remedies. Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 290 (2001) (observing that “[t]he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others”); Transamerica Mortg. Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 19 (1979) (recognizing that “[i]t is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.”); American Bus Ass'n v. Slater, 231 F.3d 1, 4 (D.C.Cir.2000) (concluding that a statute's enumerated remedies reveal Congress's unambiguous intent that such remedies be exclusive). In particular, plaintiffs maintain that NAHASDA authorizes HUD to recapture an overpayment of grant funds in one of only two ways: either by reducing payments to a grant recipient as indicated in Section 401 of NAHASDA (codified at 25 U.S.C. § 4161), or by adjusting the amount of a grant as indicated in Section 405 of NAHASDA (codified at 25 U.S.C. § 4165). Plaintiffs maintain, however, that under either section, HUD is required to satisfy the notice and hearing provisions of 24 C.F.R. § § 1000.532 and 1000.540, and may recover grant funds only if the agency determines that a grant recipient has failed to comply substantially with some provision of NAHASDA and has not already expended the grant funds on affordable housing activities in accordance with the statute. Absent the satisfaction of these conditions—which the parties agree did not occur here—plaintiffs contend that HUD's recovery of grant funds is devoid of legal authority and therefore amounts to an illegal exaction.
*3 Plaintiffs' argument begins with Section 401 of NAHASDA, a provision that, by the terms of its title, sets forth HUD's “Remedies for noncompliance.” Section 401(a) provides in relevant part as follows:
Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section [involving substantial noncompliance resulting from the technical incapacity of a grant recipient],;....
25 U.S.C. § 4161(a). Although the statute does not define when noncompliance is substantial, HUD has done so in NAHASDA's implementing regulations as follows:
HUD will review the circumstances of each noncompliance with NAHASDA and the regulations on a case-by-case basis to determine if the noncompliance is substantial. This review is a two step process. First, there must be a noncompliance with NAHASDA or these regulations. Second, the noncompliance must be substantial. A noncompliance is substantial if:
(a) The noncompliance has a material effect on the recipient meeting its major goals and objectives as described in its Indian Housing Plan;
(b) The noncompliance represents a material pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance with a particular provision of NAHASDA or the regulations, even if a single instance of noncompliance would not be substantial;
(c) The noncompliance involves the obligation or expenditure of a material amount of the NAHASDA funds budgeted by the recipient for a material activity; or
(d) The noncompliance places the housing program at substantial risk of fraud, waste or abuse.
In plaintiffs' view, HUD may not take action under Section 401 until it finds, on the basis of a hearing, that a grant recipient has failed to comply substantially with some provision of NAHASDA or its regulations, in this case with 24 C.F.R. § 1000.318 (the regulation outlining the appropriate treatment of FCAS). In addition, plaintiffs read Section 401 as limiting the recovery of grant funds to “the amount of such payments that were not expended in accordance with this chapter.” That limitation, plaintiffs argue, prohibits HUD from recapturing grant funds that have been expended on eligible, affordable housing activities, defined in Section 202 of NAHASDA as activities “to develop, operate, maintain, or support affordable housing for rental or homeownership, or to provide housing services with respect to affordable housing.” 25 U.S.C. § 4132. Plaintiffs thus maintain that HUD's recapture of their grant funds was not authorized under Section 401 because HUD: (1) failed to provide them with an opportunity for a hearing; (2) made no finding that they had “failed to comply substantially” with 24 C.F.R. § 1000.318 (or any other provision of NAHASDA); and (3) recaptured, through the offset of subsequent years' grants, payments that had already been spent “in accordance with” NAHASDA.
*4 Nor, plaintiffs argue, did HUD satisfy the terms of Section 405, the only other NAHASDA provision addressing the adjustment of grant funds. Section 405, titled “Review and audit by Secretary,” authorizes HUD to conduct reviews and audits to determine whether a grant recipient is carrying out eligible activities in a timely manner and in compliance with its housing plan. 25 U.S.C. § 4165. Section 405 sets out the remedies HUD may pursue following such an audit as follows:.
25 U.S.C. § 4165(d).
Plaintiffs point out, however, that HUD's authority to adjust grants under Section 405 is “[s]ubject to section 4161(a),” a phrase plaintiffs interpret as imposing the same requirements found in Section 401—specifically the notice, hearing, and substantial noncompliance requirements—as a precondition to action under Section 405. Just as with Section 401, in other words, plaintiffs read Section 405 as authorizing HUD to adjust grant amounts only after the agency has provided a grant recipient with notice and the opportunity for a hearing and has found the recipient to be in substantial noncompliance with NAHASDA.
The adjustment of grants under Section 405 is further limited, plaintiffs argue, by 24 C.F.R. § 1000.532, a regulation promulgated as part of the first negotiated rulemaking following the enactment of NAHASDA. 63 Fed.Reg. 12334, 12371 (Mar. 12, 1998). That regulation, in plaintiffs' view, requires HUD to provide the opportunity for a hearing whenever the agency adjusts a grant amount after an audit under Section 405 and explicitly prohibits the recapture of NAHASDA funds that have been expended on affordable housing activities. Section 1000.532, titled “What are the adjustments HUD makes to a recipient's future year's grant amount under section 405 of NAHASDA?,” reads in relevant part as follows:
.
FN5. 24 C.F.R. § 1000.540, a regulation cited by plaintiffs in support of their claim, in turn directs HUD to employ the hearing procedures set forth in 24 C.F.R. Part 26 when conducting a hearing under NAHASDA. See, e.g., 24 C.F.R. § 26.2 (requiring an Administrative Law Judge to serve as the hearing officer); 24 C.F.R. § 26.46 (anticipating the calling of witnesses). That regulation, however, sets forth the procedures to be followed if a hearing is required, but does not address the question of when a hearing is required in the first instance.
Plaintiffs thus argue that HUD, whether acting under Section 401 or Section 405,FN6 must provide a grant recipient with notice and the opportunity for a hearing, and may adjust grant funds only if the agency has determined that the grant recipient is in substantial noncompliance with NAHASDA and, even then, only if the funds to be recaptured were misspent by the grant recipient, i.e., “not expended in accordance with” NAHASDA.FN7 Sections 401 and 405, in other words, do not allow HUD to recapture NAHASDA funds that are improvidently allocated by HUD, but spent by a grant recipient in accordance with the statute. Actions taken outside of this framework, plaintiffs maintain, go beyond HUD's delegated authority and consequently amount to an illegal exaction.
FN6. Plaintiffs indicated at oral argument that they believe that Section 405 is the applicable section in this case because HUD acted pursuant to an audit conducted at the direction of HUD's Office of Inspector General to determine whether grant recipients had included ineligible housing units in the information they had provided to HUD. The question of whether HUD should have proceeded under Section 401 or Section 405, however, does not alter plaintiffs' analysis, given plaintiffs' position that Section 405 contains the same notice, hearing, and substantial noncompliance requirements as Section 401. Under either section, plaintiffs maintain, HUD failed to meet the criteria for retroactively adjusting plaintiffs' grant funds.
FN7. The record at present contains no evidence as to whether the grant funds in question were “expended in accordance with” NAHASDA; such an issue, plaintiffs maintain, is precisely one that would have been addressed in a hearing conducted under Section 401 or 405.
Defendant, for its part, rejects plaintiffs' characterization of their claim. In defendant's view, the misallocation of grant funds is not an issue of a grant recipient's compliance with NAHASDA that should be addressed under Title IV (Sections 401 and 405), but rather of HUD's own failure to comply with the statute, specifically with the agency's obligation to pay grant recipients in accordance with the formula established by negotiated rulemaking as set forth in Title III, 25 U.S.C. § 4151.FN8 HUD's recovery of grant overpayments, in other words, was an action the agency took to address HUD's own noncompliance with NAHASDA, and accordingly involved none of the enforcement provisions set out in Sections 401 and 405.
FN8. 25 U.S.C. § 4151, titled “Annual allocation,” provides as follows:.
Indeed, defendant maintains that Sections 401 and 405 do not, by their terms, apply in the instant case at all. In defendant's view, Section 401 is directed toward one specific situation: where a grant recipient has engaged in substantial noncompliance with NAHASDA. Defendant argues, however, that the action that gave rise to the overpayments here—the inclusion of ineligible FCAS in the allocation formula in violation of 24 C.F.R. § 1000.318—is not considered a compliance issue, but is treated instead as a data error.FN9 In other words, defendant argues, plaintiffs are not believed to be in substantial noncompliance with NAHASDA and their case therefore does not fall within the notice and hearing requirements of Section 401.FN10
FN9. Defendant's position is consistent with the approach HUD took in recovering the overpaid grant funds. The record indicates that HUD considered the inclusion of ineligible FCAS to be analogous to a data error and therefore used as its guide the challenge and appeal procedures set forth in 24 C.F.R. § 1000.336 (dealing with data errors) in recovering the overpaid grant funds. Notably, 24 C.F.R. § 1000.336 was later amended through a four-year, consensus rulemaking process to include FCAS challenges as an issue to be addressed under that regulation. 72 Fed.Reg. 20018, 20025–26 (Apr. 20, 2007); 24 C.F.R. § 1000.336(a)(4) ( “An Indian tribe, [Tribally Designated Housing Entity], or HUD may challenge data used in the [Indian Housing Block Grant] Formula and HUD formula determinations regarding: ... (4) Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS)....)
FN10. Plaintiffs do not contend that they were in substantial noncompliance with NAHASDA or its regulations; rather, they take the position that grant funds may not be adjusted retroactively under NAHASDA in the absence of substantial noncompliance.
Similarly, defendant interprets Section 405 as applying only to: (1) audits under chapter 75 of title 31 of the United States Code (examining issues such as whether the financial statements of the audited entity have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles); and (2) reviews and audits by HUD to determine whether the grant recipient has carried out eligible activities, has a continuing capacity to carry out eligible activities in a timely manner, and is in compliance with the Indian housing plan submitted pursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 4112. In defendant's view, however, HUD has not performed a review or audit that meets either criterion, making Section 405—and its accompanying regulation, 24 C.F.R. § 1000.532—inapplicable to this dispute.
*6 Nor, defendant argues, are plaintiffs correct that Section 405 contains the same notice, hearing, and substantial noncompliance requirements as Section 401. In defendant's view, Section 405's introductory phrase “[s]ubject to section 4161(a)” does not—as plaintiffs contend—import Section 401's requirements into Section 405, but rather excludes from the scope of Section 405 cases that fall under Section 401, i.e., cases involving substantial noncompliance. Defendant thus maintains that the Secretary of HUD may exercise discretionary authority under Section 405 except in situations where HUD finds substantial noncompliance under Section 401 (thereby requiring notice, the opportunity for a hearing, and mandatory enforcement by HUD).
Given this interpretation of NAHASDA and its accompanying regulations, defendant maintains that the statute simply does not reach the situation now before us: the agency's correction of a grant-funding error to recover overpayments improvidently made by HUD. Defendant instead sees HUD as having exercised what defendant describes as the government's “inherent authority” to recover sums erroneously paid—a common law right, defendant maintains, that exists irrespective of any limitations on recapture contained in NAHASDA or its implementing regulations.
In defendant's view, HUD, like all government agencies, has an inherent authority recognized by the Supreme Court to recover funds that the agency has “wrongfully, erroneously, or illegally paid.” United States v. Wurts, 303 U.S. 414, 415 (1938). Further, defendant maintains that “[n]o statute is necessary to authorize the United States to sue in such a case. The right to sue is independent of statute.” Id. (quoting United States v. Bank of the Metropolis, 40 U.S. 377, 401 (1841)). Such authority is based upon “the principle that parties receiving moneys illegally paid by a public officer are liable ex aequo et bono [i.e., in justice and fairness] to refund them.” Barrett Ref. Corp. v. United States, 242 F.3d 1055, 1064 (Fed.Cir.2001) (quoting Wisconsin Cent. R.R. Co. v. United States, 164 U.S. 190, 212 (1896)). Nor, defendant contends, must HUD file suit to establish the illegality of the payment, but may instead offset the debt administratively from amounts otherwise owed to the debtor. United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239 (1947) (recognizing that “[t]he government has the same right ‘which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due to him.’ ”) (quoting Gratiot v. United States, 40 U.S. 336, 370 (1841)). Defendant thus argues that HUD's administrative offset of grant funds was a lawful exercise of the agency's common law right—one that exists wholly outside the parameters of NAHASDA.
II.
We cannot accept defendant's argument. Although defendant insists that Sections 401 and 405 of NAHASDA do not govern HUD's actions in this case and that HUD at no time implemented a sanction thereunder, we read Section 405 as addressing the situation at hand. Section 405, titled “Review and audit by Secretary,” provides in relevant part as follows:
*7 An entity designated by an Indian tribe as a housing entity shall be treated, for purposes of chapter 75 of Title 31, as a non-Federal entity that is subject to the audit requirements that apply to non-Federal entities under that chapter.
In addition to any audit or review under subsection (a) of this section, to the extent the Secretary determines such action to be appropriate, the Secretary may conduct an audit or review of a recipient in order to—
(A) determine whether the recipient—
(i) has carried out—
(I) eligible activities in a timely manner; and
(II) eligible activities and certification in accordance with this chapter and other applicable law;
(ii) has a continuing capacity to carry out eligible activities in a timely manner; and (iii) is in compliance with the Indian housing plan of the recipient; and
(B) verify the accuracy of information contained in any performance report submitted by the recipient under section 4164 of this title.
As indicated above, defendant reads this section as applying only to a narrow category of reviews and audits conducted by HUD. We, however, read Section 405 as conferring broad authority on the Secretary to review a grant recipient's performance under NAHASDA, including monitoring a grant recipient's compliance with its Indian housing plan and verifying the accuracy of the recipient's performance reports—the two primary program documents submitted by a grant recipient. 25 U.S.C. § 4165(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B). In the instant case, HUD acted pursuant to an audit conducted at the direction of HUD's Office of Inspector General to determine whether ineligible housing had been included in the allocation formula. Such a review, we believe, comes within Section 405's broad mandate to ensure that the grant program is being conducted in accordance with NAHASDA. See, e.g., 25 U.S.C. § 4165(b)(1)(A)(i)(II) (authorizing review “to determine whether the recipient has carried out eligible activities ... in accordance with this chapter”).FN11 In addition, HUD ultimately characterized as ineligible for grant purposes housing units that plaintiffs contend should properly have been included as FCAS, a dispute that should have been the subject of a hearing and not the object of unilateral resolution by HUD.
FN11. Indeed, the distinction defendant draws between actions purportedly taken under Title III to ensure HUD's compliance with NAHASDA and actions taken under Title IV to ensure a grant recipient's compliance with NAHASDA is an artificial one that is not borne out by NAHASDA's implementing regulations. The regulations make clear that the grant recipient, the grant beneficiary, and HUD all share responsibility for monitoring activities under NAHASDA. 24 C.F.R. § 1000.501. In particular, a grant recipient “is responsible for monitoring grant activities, ensuring compliance with applicable Federal requirements and monitoring performance goals under the [Indian Housing Plan]”; “for preparing at least annually ... a performance report covering the assessment of program progress and goal attainment under the [Indian Housing Plan]”; and for conducting “an evaluation of the recipient's performance in accordance with performance objectives and measures.” 24 C.F.R. § 1000.502(a). HUD is charged under this same regulation with reviewing the recipient as set forth in § 1000.520, a regulation that calls for HUD's review of each grant recipient's performance, at least annually, to determine whether the recipient has met the same standards identified in Section 405 ( i.e., has carried out its eligible activities in a timely manner and in accordance with the requirements and the primary objective of NAHASDA and with other applicable laws; has a continuing capacity to carry out those activities in a timely manner; has complied with the Indian Housing Plan; and has submitted accurate performance reports). 24 C.F.R. § 1000.502(c). HUD may, in conducting this review, consider a wide array of information, including reports prepared by the recipient, records maintained by the recipient, and any other reliable relevant information which relates to the performance measures under 24 C.F.R. § 1000.524. We therefore do not construe Title IV remedies as directed exclusively toward grant recipient compliance; rather we see HUD and grant recipients working together under Title IV and its accompanying regulations to ensure the success of the NAHASDA program.
That defendant reads this section too narrowly is evidenced by NAHASDA's implementing regulations. Those regulations, as originally proposed,FN12 directed that a grant recipient indicate the number of units removed from its FCAS inventory in the recipient's Annual Performance Report—a report whose accuracy Section 405 review is designed to ensure. 25 U.S.C. § 4165(b)(1)(B) (authorizing review to “verify the accuracy of information contained in any performance report”). Because of timing considerations, however, the final version of the implementing regulations specified that such information should instead be included in a grant recipient's Formula Response Form. 63 Fed.Reg. 12364–65 (Mar. 12, 1998) (setting forth final rule 24 C.F.R. § 1000.302, which defines a Formula Response Form as “the form recipients use to report changes to their Formula Current Assisted stock, formula area, and other formula related information before each year's formula allocation”). As explained in the committee notes accompanying the final rule:
FN12. 24 C.F.R. § 1000.334, as originally proposed, provided in full as follows:).
*8 The Committee added a definition of “Formula Response Form” to reflect the changes made elsewhere in the rule. The proposed rule would have required data for the formula to be included in the [Indian Housing Plan]. However, because the data is needed before the [Indian Housing Plan] submission date, the Committee decided to require formula data to be submitted on a separate form.
63 Fed.Reg. 12341–42; see also 24 C.F.R. § 1000.315 (2007) (clarifying that the Formula Response Form is the only mechanism a recipient may use to report changes to the number of FCAS).
The fact that FCAS information is included in a separate form due to administrative necessity does not, in our view, take the review of FCAS outside the purview of Section 405. Indeed, a later regulation specified that “[r]eview of FCAS will be accomplished by HUD as a component of A–133 audits, routine monitoring, FCAS target monitoring, or other reviews.” 24 C.F.R. § 1000.319(d) (2007). Given this framework, we think it evident that HUD's audit of plaintiffs' FCAS counts, conducted at the direction of the OIG, falls squarely within the agency's authority under Section 405.FN13
FN13. HUD revised its regulations in 2007 to specify that if a grant recipient receives an overpayment of funds because it fails to report FCAS changes on the Formula Response Form in a timely manner, the recipient must repay the funds within five fiscal years. 24 C.F .R. § 1000.319(b). In addition, Congress amended Section 401 the following year to indicate that a failure to report FCAS correctly does not, in itself, constitute substantial noncompliance. Native American Housing Assistance and Self–Determination Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub.L. No. 110–411, 122 Stat. 4319 (2008) (codified at 25 U.S.C. § 4161(a)(2)) (specifying that “[t]he failure of a recipient to comply with the requirements of section 4152(b)(1) of this title regarding the reporting of low-income dwelling units shall not, in itself, be considered to be substantial noncompliance for purposes of this subchapter.”). Neither of these developments, however, means that FCAS issues that come to light as the result of an audit fall outside of Section 405. And while Section 1000.319's requirement that grant recipients repay overpaid grant funds within five years arguably conflicts with Section 1000.532's prohibition on the recapture of grant amounts already expended on affordable housing activities, the new regulation was not yet in place when plaintiffs' grant funds were recaptured, and thus, the reconciliation of these provisions must await another day.
Because we conclude that Section 405 applies in the instant case, we further conclude that HUD was not free to disregard the requirements of that section in favor of a common law remedy with no apparent rules or limitations.FN14 Resort to federal common law is appropriate only when a statute does not speak to an issue. City of Milwaukee v. Illinois and Michigan, 451 U.S. 304, 319 n.14 (1981) (recognizing that “federal courts create federal common law only as a necessary expedient when problems requiring federal answers are not addressed by federal statutory law”). But where, as here, Congress has spoken to the question, HUD may not circumvent that statutory scheme. American Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut, ––– U.S. ––––, 131 S.Ct. 2527, 2537 (2011) (“[W]hen Congress addresses a question previously governed by a decision rested on federal common law the need for such an unusual exercise of law-making by federal courts disappears.”) (quoting City of Milwaukee, 451 U.S. at 314). In the present case, we believe Section 405—and not federal common law—governs the situation at hand.
FN14. Because we conclude that Section 405 is applicable in the present case, we need not reach the issue of whether a common law right to recover money erroneously paid, through administrative offset, exists in situations not covered by the statute (as, for instance, where the agency makes a unilateral mistake by erroneously inserting an additional digit into a payment amount) or whether, as plaintiffs maintain, NAHASDA displaces any such right “through the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory program supervised by an expert administrative agency.” City of Milwaukee v. Illinois and Michigan, 451 U.S. 304, 317 (1981). We observe, however, that the cases plaintiffs cite for the proposition that courts should read the enumeration of remedies in a statute as precluding other remedies— see, e.g., Alexander, 532 U.S. at 290; Transamerica Mortg., 444 U.S. at 19; American Bus, 231 F.3d at 4—do not involve the displacement of a preexisting common law right. We therefore do not accept the contention that NAHASDA's enumeration of certain remedies necessarily precludes the exercise of an additional, common law remedy in all circumstances. Rather, “[t]he test for whether congressional legislation excludes the declaration of federal common law is simply whether the statute speaks directly to the question at issue.” American Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut, ––– U.S. ––––, 131 S.Ct. 2527, 2537 (2011); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 (1978).
The decision in City of Kansas City v. United States Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev., 861 F.2d 739, 743 (D.C.Cir.1988), is instructive on this point. In discussing the importance of the procedural requirements set forth in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (“CDBG”), 42 U.S.C. § 5304(d) (1982 & Supp. IV 1986)—an act whose enforcement provisions contain essentially the same language as NAHASDA's Sections 401 and 405—the court observed that such protections play “a critical role” in the statutory scheme because they “ensure that a city legally entitled to an annual CDBG grant will not be precipitously deprived of funding pursuant to arbitrary action by HUD.” Id. at 744 (internal quotation omitted). Of particular relevance to the instant case, the court pointed out that “[i]n most cases, Congress has been silent on the question of a grantee's procedural rights when an agency decides to terminate some or all of its federal grant. When, as in this case, Congress has not been silent, a court has a special obligation to ensure that the agency does not end-run the clear procedural protections which Congress provided.” Id. at 745 (internal quotation and citation omitted). The court continued as follows:
*9 The Secretary cannot ignore the notice and hearing provisions of section 111 [the section corresponding to NAHASDA's Section 401] simply because he prefers the more informal procedures of section 104(d) [the section corresponding to NAHASDA's Section 405]. HUD's own report admits that HUD has used section 104 in order to “avoid[ ] the more detailed and rigorous procedural standards of Section 111 .” This application of the statute plainly violates congressional intent. As we have previously noted, “[w]hen a statute dictates that parties receive notice and a hearing ... the provision of those basic procedural rights is not left to be decided by administrative ‘flexibility’ or ‘discretion.’ “ In the district court's words, section 111 would be a “nullity” if the Secretary could avoid it whenever he chose, as he has for fourteen years, by using section 104(d) instead.
We cannot, however, accept plaintiffs' assertion that Section 405's introductory phrase “[s]ubject to section 4161(a)” imports the substantial noncompliance provision of Section 401 into actions taken under Section 405. Rather, we read this language as indicating that compliance issues must be addressed under Section 401 and not under Section 405. In other words, defendant is correct that the phrase “[s]ubject to section 4161(a)” excludes the scope of Section 401 from Section 405. Shell Oil Co. v. Manley Oil Corp ., 124 F.2d 714, 716 (7th Cir.1941) (observing that “[t]he words ‘subject to,’ used in their ordinary sense, mean ‘subordinate to,’ ‘subservient to’ or ‘limited by.’ ”).
Such a conclusion follows from the structure of the statute itself. Section 401, by the terms of its title, deals with “Remedies for noncompliance.” That section provides for nondiscretionary action by the Secretary (“the Secretary shall ...”), procedural safeguards, and the explicit requirement that the agency make a finding of noncompliance before imposing the section's drastic sanctions (including a termination of all grant funding and the removal of a grant recipient from the program). 25 U.S.C. § 4161. Section 405, by contrast, allows for discretionary enforcement authority pursuant to specific reviews. 25 U.S.C. § 4165. What distinguishes the two statutory sections, in other words, is the culpability of the grant recipient, the discretion of the Secretary, and the nature and severity of the sanctions imposed. It would make no sense for both sections to operate only where the grant recipient is in substantial noncompliance. Otherwise, the more lenient standards of Section 405 would swallow up Section 401.FN15
FN15. Congress added the introductory phrase “[s]ubject to section 4161(a)” to the statute in 2000 as part of an amendment to Section 405. Pub.L. No. 106–568, 114 Stat. 2868 (2000); Pub.L. No. 106–569, 114 Stat. 2944 (2000). As originally enacted in 1996, the enforcement provision of Section 405 read, prior to codification, as follows:.
Despite our conclusion that Section 405 does not incorporate a substantial noncompliance requirement by reference to Section 401, we nevertheless observe that Section 405 contains its own hearing requirement, set forth in the regulations. 24 C.F.R. § 1000.532 requires HUD to provide the opportunity for a hearing whenever the agency adjusts a grant amount after an audit under Section 405 and explicitly prohibits the recapture of NAHASDA funds that have already been expended on affordable housing activities. Providing plaintiffs with the opportunity for a hearing in this case before adjusting their grant amounts was therefore something HUD was required—but failed—to do.
*10 Recognizing that HUD must comply with the statutory and regulatory regime in providing hearings before reducing grant amounts is consistent with the legislative history of NAHASDA and its implementing regulations. From the outset, both the NAHASDA program and the promulgation of the rules implementing that program were designed to be collaborative. In Section 106(b)(2) of NAHASDA, for instance, Congress directed HUD to develop NAHASDA's implementing regulations with active tribal participation by using the procedures of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, as amended, 5 U.S.C. §§ 561–570. 62 Fed.Reg. 35718 (July 2, 1997). Pursuant to this direction, the Secretary of HUD established the Native American Housing Assistance and Self–Determination Negotiated Rulemaking Committee—made up of 48 Indian tribes, ten HUD representatives, and three individuals from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service—to negotiate and develop proposed rules implementing NAHASDA. At the recommendation of tribal leaders, the committee agreed to operate based on consensus rulemaking,FN16 and HUD committed to using, to the maximum extent feasible consistent with its legal obligations, all consensus decisions as the basis for the proposed rules. Id. at 35719.
FN16. The protocols adopted by the committee defined “consensus” as “general agreement demonstrated by the absence of expressed disagreement by a Committee member in regards to a particular issue.” 62 Fed.Reg. 35719.
During the first round of rulemaking in 1997, HUD took the position that the agency was permitted to recapture grant funds under Section 405 without providing prior notice and the opportunity for hearing and accordingly drafted a proposed rule that provided for neither. Id. at 35746 (proposed Section 1000.528). Tribal reaction to HUD's proposed rule, however, was unanimously hostile. 63 Fed.Reg. 12334, 12347 (Mar. 12, 1998). As a result, the final rule stated that “HUD will [in cases brought under Section 405] ... provide the recipient with a hearing identical to that afforded recipients under section 401(a) of NAHASDA.” Id.FN17 Two conclusions thus appear evident from the legislative record: first, that Congress intended active involvement by the Indian tribes in the promulgation of NAHASDA's implementing regulations and second, that the tribes perceived hearings as an important part of their procedural rights.
FN17. As explained more fully in the Federal Register, the proposed rule implementing Section 405(c), as drafted by HUD, “did not provide notice and an opportunity for hearing.” Id. The Federal Register continues as follows:.
Requiring HUD to observe this additional level of procedural protection makes sense since the NAHASDA program is designed to protect the Indians. 25 U.S.C. § 4101 sets forth congressional findings regarding NAHASDA. In particular, Congress found that “there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes” (Section 4101(2)); that “the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people” (Section 4101(3)); that “the need for affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations ... is acute” (Section 4101(6)); and that “providing affordable homes in safe and healthy environments is an essential element in the special role of the United States in helping Indian tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status” (Section 4101(5)). See also 24 C.F.R. § 1000.2 (directing that these congressional findings be used as the guiding principles in the implementation of NAHASDA). Reducing a present year's grant to recover past funds misallocated by HUD (but spent correctly by the tribe) contravenes these goals. See, e.g., Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U.S. 773, 783 n.8 (1983) (recognizing that the beneficiaries of grant funds suffer where a reduction in grant funds to remedy past deficiencies leads to a corresponding reduction in program services).
*11 In conclusion, we read Section 405 as governing HUD's actions and thus as precluding HUD from exercising any common law right the agency might otherwise possess under circumstances not directly addressed by the statute. We further read that section as applying only in cases that do not involve a grant recipient's substantial noncompliance with NAHASDA (which would fall instead under Section 401). In addition, we construe Section 405's implementing regulations as requiring the Secretary to provide notice and the opportunity for a hearing before making an adjustment to a recipient's grant amounts and as preventing the Secretary from recapturing grant amounts already expended on affordable housing activities. To conclude otherwise would allow HUD to deny grant recipients the protections Congress has afforded them when faced with a reduction in their grant funding, would further allow the agency to circumvent a process put into place by consensus rulemaking at the direction of Congress, and would lead to the anomalous result that a grant recipient in substantial noncompliance with NAHASDA would receive greater procedural protections before experiencing a recapture of their grant funds than recipients in full compliance (a target for recapture through a fault of HUD's rather than their own). We are unwilling to endorse such an unsatisfactory result.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' second claim for relief is DENIED.

Some people are intimidated by the thought of an entire month’s worth of cooking in one day.
Or they get paid weekly or biweekly and their food budget doesn’t allow an entire month’s work of grocery shopping at one time.
If that is the case, freezer cooking can still work for you.
Here are some ideas that may help in starting out.
1.) You don’t have to cook for an entire month on your first time. You can ease into it. Start with cooking a double batch of whatever you are making for a week and freeze the extra. In one week, you will have a weeks worth of food saved up. If you do it every week for a month, you’d be able to take a month off. Or pick a few days when you can double your meal and store what you can.
2.) You could mini batch cook for a week or two instead of a whole month. Pick a day once a week where you will dedicate a few hours to cooking large batches of meals to stock your freezer.
3.) Maybe you don’t mind cooking dinners each night but breakfasts are very difficult because of a busy morning schedule. Choose a few meals you could have for breakfast and spend a day making a week’s worth or more.
4.) Or jump right in and enjoy the benefits of less waste, more time, and home-cooked meals for a whole month or more.
I chose to suffer for one very long day and reap the benefits of taking a full month off. If I am completely honest, the full day of cooking is beyond exhausting, almost like being in labor, but it’s true that as soon as the freezer is stocked you forget the pain involved and are focused on the blessing. After a month or so goes by you are ready to do it all over again.
There are many ways to go about freezer cooking. If you are fairly happy with the current recipes you are using you can simply tweak them to accommodate freezing.
A few notes on what freezes well.
- Most baked goods freeze very well. I’ve done breakfast muffins, breads, rolls, etc. and large batches of homemade granola. You can also make blueberry waffles or pancakes made with whole grains and freeze them to be popped in the toaster just like store-bought waffles but without all the chemicals and preservatives.
- You can pre-freeze fruit and yogurt for breakfast with your granola or for easy smoothies. I slice bananas, berries, or peaches into chunks and put in muffin tins. Then spoon yogurt,( I prefer Greek for the extra creaminess) over each cup almost to the top. Tap the muffin tin on the counter to let the yogurt settle. Then pop it in the freezer until it’s completely frozen. Remove tray and pop each cup out with a fork and freeze in freezer bags. You can do individual or gallon sized bags. They won’t freeze into one large clump as long as you put them in right away and they don’t have time to defrost. You can pull them out the night before or grab and go, it will defrost rather quickly if they are in muffin sized amounts. If you’re going to use them in a smoothie, they can go directly into the blender.
- We like to BBQ in the summer months so I’ll get a cut of meat, make a marinade, cut up veggies and freeze the uncooked cut and marinade in a Ziploc freezer bag. It can be taken out a day or two in advance, placed in a bowl and defrosted in the fridge. In the time it takes to defrost, the marinade will soak in and it’s ready for the grill. Whip up a salad or steam some veggies and it’s a simple meal.
- Assembled casseroles freeze really well. Do all the precooking ahead of time for any meats involved. Then assemble the casserole up to the point you would normally bake, and freeze instead. When defrosted, it is ready to pop in the oven. You could do lasagna, rice chicken casseroles with spinach or brocoli, stuffed french toast, enchiladas and more. I have not had much success with frozen pasta, as it often gets mushy when defrosted and recooked. Lasagna noodles do well but I suggest making sauces and boiling the water for fresh pasta on the day you will eat it. Orzo is the other exception, but make sure to cook it al dente as it will have more time to cook when you are reheating it.
- We also like to have a few staple meals that can be made into anything. Spaghetti sauces with seasonal veggies or meatballs can be made in huge batches and eaten with many different noodles. Fish packets wrapped in foil to stick in the oven, crockpot, or grill can be eaten with fresh veggies or made into fish tacos. Layered pans with Mexican rice, cheese, taco meat, bell peppers, onions , and pinto or black beans made in bulk in the slow cooker can be defrosted and cooked into tacos, burritos, enchiladas, baked potato toppings, quesadillas, mixed with eggs for a mexican omelet, or eaten alone.
- Soups and stews are my favorite for winter. Although, I love potato soups, they don’t usually freeze well. Potatoes are very hard to freeze as they typically taste overly starchy or too watery when cooked. I make a few big batches in the crock pot starting at the beginning of the day and pour them out into a super large cake pan to help them cool faster so they can be stored in Ziplocs and frozen. Then I start the next batch of soup. I usually make at least three soups with three meals each so I end up with 9 days of soup in a month.
Ok, so next comes the planning part where you make your master lists. Tune in for the next post where I’ll share some of my super top-secret recipes, my favorite links and menu planning tools, and ideas for how to shop, plan, and cook your way to free evenings for a month.
Great tips! I have done a little freezer cooking on my own, mostly just doubling whatever I’m making that day. I like your idea of the layered mexican rice. I may have to try that next.
I have used the no-boil noodles in my freezer lasagna and that seems to work good. Looking forward to the next post, as always!

A contemporary echo: Mei Dhwani
- Satish Suri, Bangalore
September 13, 2011
Contemporary Dance seems to have come of age, which was clearly evident in the resounding echo of appreciation from the packed hall in Bangalore on 4th August, when Attakalari Centre for Movement Arts presented their new production Mei Dhwani, the title being derived by linking the Tamil and Sanskrit words (mei meaning body and Dhwani meaning echo).
Mei Dhwani subtly alludes to “Echoes of the body.” Metamorphically, the three elements fire, water and earth are symbolized through props. The synergy of the male and female energy, fire acts as a metaphor for male energy and its inherent destructive power and water the ever flowing life stream representing the female energy. The metallic pots used in the production suggest the unfathomable feminine infinity contrasted against the phallic cylindrical oil lamps.
This inspired production portrays individuals who are captives of circumstance and history. The narrative begins with Jayachandran Palazhy seated on a pot signifying the unity of body and spirit, as the dancers move into the stage using the language of movement of both Bharatanatyam and Kalaraipayyatu to conjure the sensorial narrative that traverses universal predicaments. The pots used by the female dancers held in hand and rolled over the body through the skillful use of movements of the hands and legs create an individual narrative that oscillates between suspended realms of body and soul. The male dancers enter with metallic cylinders, symbolizing male energy. The awakening through the background tune “Hosh me aaa” as the lighted oil lamps are placed on the cylinders. The artists all dressed in white, capturing fragility and turmoil. The landscape soon changes to the artists’ costumes which sport a purple colour signifying preparation of the body. The tempo increases as the battle of fury wages within, resonating the collective memory of emotions ending finally with all the artists lying down on the floor and the spotlight focuses once again on Jayachandran sitting on the pot in the opposite corner of the stage from where he had started at the beginning of the show, traversing the imagined landscape and returning to the central theme of unity of mind body and spirit.
The dancers, three female and four male, energetic and vibrant, along with Jayachandran played their roles to perfection. Excellent production values enriched the performance. The creative choreography of Jayachandran, the artistic and creative director of the company, the subtle and evocative lighting by Thomas Dotzler creating the ritualized arena, the vibrant soundscape provided by the Israeli composer and sound artist duo of Patrick Sebag and Yotam Agam, and the costumes designed by Himanshu and Sonali of Hidden Harmony with additional costume design by Asha and Samantha of Elan Design Studio complimented the aesthetic values of the production.
Contemporary Dance generally suffers from repetitive movements which hang heavy on the audience attention and this narrative did no better. It would have been more impactful if the duration in any way could have been reduced..

- Name: One Thousand Years of Death (千年殺し, Sennen Goroshi)
- Type: E-rank, Offensive, Short range (0-5m)[1]
- Users: Kakashi Hatake, Naruto Uzumaki
- Debut (Anime): Naruto Episode 4
- Debut (Manga): Chapter 5
A very simple technique with an over-dramatic name, One Thousand Years of Death is little more than inserting one's index and middle fingers (similar to the Tiger hand seal) into the opponent's rectum, causing constipation, pain and/or embarrassment. It has no effect on unconscious targets. Characters that see the jutsu react oddly (Temari blushes, Pakkun questions if it's really a jutsu, exploding tag, it can be a lethal technique. The aforementioned variant has only been used by Naruto.
Trivia
- This jutsu's full name is "Hidden Leaf Village Secret Finger Technique: Thousand Years of Death" (木ノ葉隠れ秘伝・体術の奥義・千年殺し, Konohagakure Hiden: Taijutsu no Ōugi: modeled after the Kancho, a Japanese prank of common usage among children. When Kakashi first performed it, it might have been a simple kancho with a jutsu-like name, which Naruto would believe to be a real jutsu, eventually leading to its usage in real combat.

Hashirama SenjuTalk362
this wiki
Hash.[10] Hashirama died shortly after the founding of Konoha in one of the many wars that were raging during this revolutionary era, but not before passing on the title of Hokage to Tobirama.[11].[12][13] His strength was so greatly respected by the shinobi world that both Tobi (while under the guise of being Madara Uchiha) and Madara himself claimed Hashirama was the one person whom they most admired and detested.[12][14].[17].[18].[19] The fact that he could use medical ninjutsu demonstrates that Hashirama likely had excellent chakra control.[13]. Even those who obtained this power through unorthodox means, such as Yamato, stated that his use of Wood Release was much weaker in terms of raw power.[20] He could create clones of himself, massive forests, or create gigantic flowering trees which were able to put targets to sleep. In an instant, he could shape the entire battlefield for his own uses.
Along with his kekkei genkai, Orochimaru also coveted Hashirama's unique ability to control tailed beasts.[21] Of all his considerable talents, it was this ability in particular that made Hashirama unparalleled in the shinobi world, so much so that he is regarded as one of the few people capable of completely controlling a tailed beast.[22] At one time, he had many of the beasts in his possession.[9] This ability was greatly amplified by his crystal necklace, which Yamato suggested that he required to control even Naruto's partial lapses into tailed forms.[23][24]
Part I.[25]
Legacy
Because of the heritage of the Senju — who are said to be direct descendants of the Sage of the Six Paths — and the kekkei genkai that Hashirama possessed, his DNA became highly coveted. During the battle at the Valley of the End where Madara Uchiha was thought to have died, the latter took the opportunity to collect his DNA, integrate it into his body, and allow him access to the Wood Release kekkei genkai.[26]
Some time after Hashirama's death, Orochimaru experimented with Hashirama's DNA. Desiring Hashirama's unique abilities, Orochimaru exhumed the First's body and infused sixty child test subjects with DNA harvested from his remains, hoping that one would prove able to use Wood Release. Only Yamato survived the process.[27]
Danzō Shimura's right arm had also been infused with Hashirama's DNA through a similar experiment with Orochimaru, in the hopes of controlling the powers of the Nine-Tails, as well as to increase his physical energy to maintain the ten Sharingan embedded on his right arm as well as use the technique Kotoamatsukami within a relatively short span of time compared to the decade it would've taken on its own.[28] Those cells also allowed him to use Izanagi for extended periods.
With some of the cells taken from Hashirama, Madara created White Zetsu, though his Wood Release is stated to be not as powerful as Hashirama's. Madara also implanted Hashirama's cells into Obito's body which allowed him to use the perfected Izanagi. He also had the cells 'planted' at his headquarters from which grew a massive flowering tree which has a mindless clone of Hashirama coming out of its base. It also supports the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, and, having gradually been fed amounts of the tailed beast chakra, among its roots, seems to have helped produce a legion of 100,000 White Zetsu clones for Tobi's army against the Allied Shinobi Forces' numbers of about 80,000.[29]
Part of the legacy that Hashirama has also left behind is known as the Will of Fire, a belief held by all the members of Konohagakure. Tobi frequently mentions or remembers Hashirama, his musing over his sworn enemy tends to range from both utter contempt to a begrudging respect and admiration. Tobi does admit that Hashirama was the only person whom he respected of the Senju clan and claims that Naruto Uzumaki has inherited Hashirama's Will of Fire while Sasuke Uchiha has inherited the hatred of his clan.[30].[31] However, in flashbacks, no such scar is visible.[32][33]!"[10]

start saying anything i have a few points to prove my veiws so please don't be hasty read through before commenting,its not that much.
first of all naruto never anticipated that the five kages would lose to edo madara,am i right so he used a considerable amount of both his and the kyubi's chakra trying to defeat tobi,beliving that the five kages will succeed just as itachi succeeded but he was wrong wasn't he,madara is just too strong plus he has infinate amount of chakra since he's an edo zombie and he can fight for like forever.and now he is done with them and has come to aid obito whom they havn't even defeated yet
gai and kakashi too are all exausted since immediately after finishing the 7 edo sword men of the mist they went ahead to join naruto whitout any rest and they have used considerable amount of chakra too in the current fight with obito and now madara is there so they dont stand a chance.
my last point is that the jubi is getting revived once it is fully revived even though it not complete it will still have a devastating power that would be very difficult to estinguish(defeat).
but all is not lost since we dont know what the creep and the brat are up to yet,and also all the other allied shinobi forces are heading to aid them but personally i dont think no. will makeany diffrence with the edo madara,but who knows something unexpected might happen after all it naruto that we are talking about.

this wiki.
Overview
The Mangekyō Sharingan has the ability to control the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox,, though how Kakashi.
Mangekyō Sharingan Variations
Echo Uchiha.
Kasai Uchiha
Kasai.
Alex Uchiha
Alex.
Shobi UchihaShobi was finally able to awaken his Mangekyō Sharingan when he killed Tetsui Uchiha.
Kenchi Ravenclaw
Being distant relatives of uchiha's ravenclaw's also posses mangekeyou which can be activated only if they kill some one very close to them and possess the same blood they do after killing they absorb the person and hence activate mangekeyou sharingan.Kenchi's mangekeyou sharing has the shape of six spiraling tomoe's his mangekeyou grants him the ability to use Tsukuyomi and kamui instead of amaterasu.However he has a limit to use of Mangekyō Sharingan he can use tsukuyomi four times and kamui three times a day.It looks the same as echo uchiha's Mangekyō but it's normal red in color.like itachi kenchi has specialized in Tsukuyomi also it is shown he has some technique's which are related to amatersu but it is not revealed wheather he can use amaterasu or not.
Ryun Uchiha
Ryun awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan after witnessing his brother's sacrifice at the hands of Danzō Shimura, as a peace offering to Kumogakure. Ryun's Mangekyō takes on the appearance of a three-pronged windmill.
Curiously, the first technique that awakened in Ryun's Mangekyō Sharingan was Susanoo, which he displayed moments after he obtained the eyes; in a fit of rage over the loss of his brother. While Itachi Uchiha was a master of Sharingan genjutsu, namely Tsukuyomi, Sasuke was a master of Amaterasu, Tobi and Kakashi were masters of their Mangekyō's space-time properties and Madarawas a master of Susanoo, Ryun has proved himself to be a master of Susanoo (like is ancestor) to a degree far beyond any other Sharingan user. Other than its ability to partially manifest to fit the situation, Ryun's Susanoo can be kept activated longer, because it drains his chakra less substantially due to his mastery of it. Ryun's incomplete version forms the spirit with skeletal muscles for attacking. He is also able to combine the technique with Amaterasu to further increase his defensive power by making it impossible to touch Susanoo without being ignited. Ryun's incomplete version has a more Pharaoh-like appearance, it has a very round head, with a box-like design around it's eyes and nose area, it also has a short spike-like protrusion coming from the bottom of it's chin, similar to a Pharaoh's mask. It wields a chakra spear in its right hand capable of easily shattering stone pillars. His incomplete version once looked similar in form to a fox, complete with ten tail-like protrusions. After being enraged by Ibitsu's story of Danzō, who had killed his brother as an apparent peace offering to another nation, Ryun's Susanoo changed into the more common, humanoid form, and later, after the formation of Tsukiakari, he is able to produce a fully manifested Susanoo, complete with flesh and armor. Susanoo may feed on it's user's emotions to become stronger. Ryun and Sasuke's versions of Susanoo was overall shown to change it's weapons accordingly.
Later on, in his battle with Kurisu Taizen, after both an onlooking Seireitou, and Kurisu had taunted him with his brother's death, his Susanoo made a change. The sword like arrow transformed into a spirit weapon, the Tonbogiri (蜻蛉切, Dragonfly cutting spear), which is an elongated spear, made of chakra, that instantly cuts in two anything that the blade touches. During the same fight, he also awakens his defensive spirit weapon, the Wanyūdō (輪入道, Wheel Monk). It is a circular shield, similar in some aspects to the Yata's Mirror, however a skull forms in it's center. The shield itself is strong enough to endure large scale physical damage, but the skull has the ability to suck in and absorb ninjutsu that comes near the shield, making it a truly powerful defense. In it's most recent appearance, it has been shown capable of gaining it's final layer of armor, making it appear like a yamabushi, and gaining the Yasakani no Magatama (八尺瓊曲玉, Benevolence Beads of Imperial Ascension) is a golden necklace worn around the Susano'o neck, and completes Susano'o power. This necklace is also seen in Seireitou's version. The powers of the necklace are yet unknown.
The second ability he displayed was Amaterasu. Whenever entering a battle in which his Mangekyō has to be used, Ryun will often use Amaterasu as a "starting technique". While he can use Sasuke's advanced blaze nature, he cannot use it with as much skill, only being able to produce a "Shield of Black Flames". He has shown skill enough with Amaterasu to quench the so-called "extinguishable black flames". Amaterasu and Susanoo both seem to strain his eyes more than his other Mangekyō techniques.
The third technique he is capable of using is the Sharingan genjutsu, Tsukuyomi. Ryun's version seems to be nowhere near Itachi's level, though it surpasses Sasuke's level, in that he can use it without a foe noticing and can somewhat warp a person's perception of time itself. Of all his Mangekyō techniques, he uses Tsukuyomi the least. He only seems to use it when he is certain that genjutsu will work on a foe, and usually uses his other genjutsu to test this out.
Taiga Uchiha
Taiga, on his first mission as a jonin team leader, lost his two genin teammates on said mission. The sadness of their final words caused his Mangekyō Sharingan to awaken. It's appearance is largely unknown, as anyone who gazed upon it met an untimely end and was unable to speak of it.
With his right eye, he discovered he could cast Amaterasu, which causes black flames to ignite whatever his eye gazes upon. With his left eye, he discovered he could cast Kyanseru, a power unique to his eyes, that seals away an opponent's chakra network for a set time. With both eyes, he discovered he could cast Susanoo, which is a physical manifestation of his chakra that allows him to create a armor around himself.
Engetsu Uchiha
Engetsu's Mangekyō Sharingan was awoken upon his being forcefully banished from Konoha, the immense feeling of loss and grief causing his Sharingan to evolve as he was hurled headlong into anguish. Something was sparked deep within the young man causing his Amaterasu to surge forth, setting the surrounding forest alight with black flames until Engetsu collapsed from exhaustion.
Amaterasu was the first of the three techniques to awaken within Engetsu's left eye, followed by Tsukuyomi within his right, Susanoo requiring the use of both eyes to activate, and his own unique technique Gekkō no Yurameku being used from either eye.
Tenjai Uchiha
Tenjai's Mangekyō Sharingan consists of a black triangle over a red background and a red hole in the center. The vertexes of the triangle touches the black rim of the iris design.
Tora Uchiha
Tora's Mangekyō Sharingan, that developed only a few days after Ryun's own Mangekyō Sharingan, took the appearance of a pinwheel, in a similar form to Itachi Uchiha's with three black dots on the edge of each side of the pinwheel, and three red dots outside the pinwheel itself. Tora's Mangekyō Sharingan is one of two, the other's being Sasuke Uchiha's, with a black background and a red design, rather than the typical black design and red background.
Hajimoto Uchiha
Hajimoto's mangekyo sharingan developed after his sensei was killed right in front of him by a band of rogue ninja in the land of waves on a routine mission. It has three tomoe floating on the sides and a slightly sideways triangle with a swirl design at each end of the triangle, it has the normal red background with a black design for the tomoe and triangle.
The first techniques to awaken in his mangekyo was Tsukuyomi and seigyoki because of his affinity to genjutsu, he first used it when his sensei was killed on the three ninja responsible for his death to break their minds so they could never harm anyone else in their lives. the seigyoki is the special ability that his sharingan had but enhanced to where he can control up to four people within 10 meters of him but it drains half of his chakra and if overused death.
The second technique was amatarasu which is one of his least used techniques because of his mastery of genjutsu and the fact that he swore to only use it in case of emergencys or if he had no other options at his disposal.
The last and final technique he acquired with the mangekyo sharingan was susanoo, he only learned this technique on accident and hasen't fully mastered it yet but he can summon the rib cage and and one arm to protect himself in case of a surprise attack or extra protection from high level ninjutsu. unlike most susanoo which are usually red or purple Hajimoto's susanoo is a dark blue color as of yet it's weapons and full appearance are unknown to hajimoto.
Tatsu Uchiha
Tatsu Uchiha was the Third Uchiha to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan with out killing his Best-friend. How he developed this is still unclear. With his Mangekyō Sharingan, Tatsu can use a space–time ninjutsu called Mizuchi which allows him to generate massive vibrations, or shock waves, which can travel though virtually any medium, including the ground, the seafloor, or even in the air. if He. It is a dreadful technique that, with skilled use and enough chakra, can easily devastate an Entire Village with ease.
Tatsu became one of the few to awaken Susanoo, as a result of awakening Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi in both eyes. He also gained the ability to create and control darkness and its unique property of gravity, a feat which no other Uchiha can Do without the aid of the Dark Release.
Keiku Uchiha
Keiku awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan after recieving the eyes of his deceases brother, Renji Uchiha. Soon after recieving his eyes, Keiku trained day and night to prefect is Mangekyo, and weekks later awakened Susanoo, as a result of awakening Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi in both eyes. His is also able to cast Amaterasu with his left and right eye and control them with their opposites and even with the same eye. He also awakened several other techniques, which have yet to be revealed.
Sayotsu Uzumaki
Sayotsu tried to train as hard as he could to gain mangekyo but he was not able to do so,Sayotsu awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan during the fourth world war when his entire team was killed and his own sensei died infront of his eyes protecting him.he Mangekyō Sharingan is awakened through the trauma experienced from the death of the person closest to the Sharingan user. Sayotsu's mangekeyoSayotsu's Mangekyou Sharingan Sayotsu's Mangekyō takes an unique for it has three sides which resembles shuriken while three other line running parallel and turning at the end resembling hockey sticks. Sayotsu's Mangekyō allows him to use three unique techniques called Kangiten,Mayhem Havoc and storm flame.
Sayot can use kamui,Kamui grants Sayotsu the use of three distinct abilities: teleportation and the third one creates a space-time barrier in the form of a swirling void that sucks any target he focuses his eye on to another dimension and also bring them back; even transporting them to a new location.,though he preferred not to use it but he is skilled with it.Originally, Sayotsu lacked proper control to accurately hit his target. His skill and aim later improved greatly, able to successfully warp small, fast-moving, or multiple targets in rapid succession as seen against Yasuki.His finesse allows him to safely warp chakra-based techniques, like the Rasengan, or even shadow clones without disrupting them, at such speed that Raido himself was fooled into believing Sayotsu failed and dispelled the technique instead. While originally demonstrating only long-range use, Sayotsu is also able to use Kamui at a short-range. With this new proficiency, Sayotsu is also able to teleport himself at will.
Also during the match with Yasuki he demonstrated the usage of Amaterasu though he hardly uses it,he is pretty good with the jutsu.
Aichi Goron
Aichi Goron activated her Mangekyō Sharingan after supposedly killing her lover Gen Nakaido in mortal combat. Having lost the last person she considered worth living for became the catalyst for awakening her new dōjutsu. Aichi's Mangekyō Sharingan takes on the form of a thick ring cut into three symmetrical pieces with three circles on the outer edge of each section. Thanks of this ascension in skill, Aichi became able to copy techniques without her special genjutsu The Uchiha DNA in her body also became used to her own DNA and melded together more successfully, allowing her to control her dōjutsu completely.
Though it is currently unknown if she can use Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, or Susanoo yet, Aichi has displayed various new abilities. In her left eye she has used the genjutsu known as Shinjiro, in which the target is taken into a red and gray mental world and is bombared with a powerful wall of energy that damages them in real life from the inside. In her right eye is the ninjutsu Inryōkukami, in which she can increase the gravitational pull around her instantly. Its intensity starts at 'Ichi', where the target is merely unable to take a step, to 'Go', where a black hole is created and eats away at the surrounding area rapidly.

Cumberland University is exploring the possibility of leaving the Mid-South Conference in all sports except football to rejoin the TranSouth Conference.
Cumberland, located in Lebanon, and Lambuth University in Jackson left the TranSouth in 1995 to join the Mid-South Conference in all sports because the conference offered football, which the TranSouth did not and still does not. Both conferences are members of the NAIA.
At the time, in order to be accepted into the Mid-South, the two schools had to join the league in all sports. However, since that time, the Mid-South has admitted non-football playing Lindsey-Wilson and admitted Belhaven as a football-only member.
Cumberland athletics director Paul Peck admitted the Bulldogs

Flying under the radar for most of the basketball season, the Hunters Lane Warriors are poised to place a significant feather in their cap.
Having clinched the District 12-AAA boys regular season championship two weeks ago, the Warriors can cap a perfect district season with a win over McGavock on Friday (Senior Night) at home. They won at McGavock 60-42 four weeks ago.
Hunters Lane is ranked No. 6 in this week’s Associated Press Class AAA poll and is 23-2 overall (11-0 in district play) after an off night Tuesday. The Warriors average 60 points a game and many of their victories are by a comfortable margin.
They have won 13 straight since a loss to No. 5 Clarksville Northeast on Dec. 20. Their only other loss was by one point, 61-60, to Hillsboro back on Nov. 21.
“From a standpoint of the won-lost record, it’s right up there [with some of our best teams],” 11th-year coach Anthony Sewell said. “But it’s hard to compare teams. This is certainly a very good one.”
A win over McGavock will give the Warriors additional momentum heading into the district tournament, which opens next week at Antioch High.
Hunters Lane is looking for a breakthrough to the state tournament.
The last time it advanced to that point was 2006. Last year, the Warriors lost in the region semifinals to host Brentwood High and they fell one step short in 2010 with a heartbreaking defeat to Beech in sectionals.
Veteran leadership is a hallmark of this year’s team.
Senior point guard Billy Hughes leads the attack with 17.1 points and 3.3 assists per game. Howard Cliff, the other starting guard, also is a senior. The rest of the starting lineup consists of seniors Stephen Daniel and Antonio Head and DeVardo Odum, a junior.
Forward Isaac Harris recently returned to action after he sustained a broken wrist early on and added depth as he has continued to round into shape.
“We have a lot of guys who are good leaders,” Sewell said. “What I like is they play with a great amount of intensity, hustle, play hard, get a lot of loose balls.”
As for the regular season finale, Sewell said, “McGavock is a team which always plays us tough. They play hard, and I’m expecting a tough game.”
The top two finishers in the district get byes into the tournament semifinals. That qualifies Hunters Lane for region regardless and means it has to play just two district tournament contests.
• State Swimming: The Tennessee Interscholastic Swim Coaches Association (TISCA) state meet is Friday and Saturday at Caulkins Pool at Centennial Sportsplex.
Baylor was the runaway winner in both the boys and girls divisions in last year’s state meet at Knoxville. Montgomery Bell Academy (boys) and Harpeth Hall (girls) were runners-up.
MBA senior Maclin Davis is the defending champion in both the 100 butterfly and 100 backstroke. The Southern Cal-bound Big Red swimmer set a state record with a 47.14 in the butterfly and is taking aim at the national private school record of 47.08.
• Slight change: Last week, the TSSAA made slight adjustments to the state basketball tournament championships at MTSU for girls (March 7-10) and boys (March 14-17).
The Class AA tournament will be played the first day in both girls (March 7) and boys (March 14), followed by the Class AAA quarterfinal games, then the Class A quarterfinal games.
Previously, Class A has opened the tourney, followed by AA and AAA.
• District meeting: A pairings meeting for coaches in District 11-AAA will be held Saturday at 10 a.m. at Franklin High, site of the tournament which opens next week.
• Hall of Fame Tennis: The Tennessee Tennis Association has announced that Fran Chandler of Jackson and Pat Guerry of Chattanooga, former prep stars at Jackson Central-Merry and Chattanooga Baylor, respectively, have been inducted into the TTA Hall of Fame. Both competed in numerous Nashville tournaments.

Escoffery began exhibiting as a fine artist around the mid-1940s alongside other important artists of her generation such as Ralph Campbell, Albert Huie and Carl Abrahams, maintaining an active presence on the Jamaican art scene until shortly before her death. Her early work consisted of landscapes and genre paintings, many of which were inspired by themes of community life in Brown’s Town, for example as depicted in the Old Woman (1955). From the 1960s onwards, she also produced paintings that have been described as ‘surrealist’. This is interesting, since the early nineteenth century movement of Surrealism was primarily a literary one in which writers sought creative and artistic freedom in their works via explorations of the sub-conscious mind. In fact it was her involvement in literature and art history that fueled her conceptual development as an artist. In describing her relationship with writing and painting, she stated:
… in order to do that, I’d better borrow T.S. Elliot’s ideas about the composition of a poem…One starts with certain strong ‘floating feelings’ which are then expressed by sifting the images to which they spontaneously attach themselves…although craft and media are different, I myself…start from the same basic feeling and the images, the visual ones, are the same too.
The scene depicted in the triptych Gateway (1965) qualifies as genre, in terms of the activities of the characters depicted. However, the otherworldly glow of the yellow sky adds an element of surrealism or rather magic realism to the entire scene. Many of her later works were abstracted, such as the epic, five-panel paintings like Mirage (1987), with its rippling layered patterns and floating abstract shapes, imply a conscious attempt at constructing visual context as an almost dream-like scenario in which fragments of thoughts can be ordered and identified. The concept of the ‘dream’ is further illustrated and narrated through iconography historically attached to Judaic social and religious history, which was part of Escoffery’s heritage.
Gloria Escoffery has received many accolades for her contribution to the development of fine arts in Jamaica. She was made Officer of the Order of Distinction in 1977 for services in the field of Art by the Jamaican Government and later in 1985, she received the Silver Musgrave from the Institute of Jamaica. She was also inducted into the Caribbean Hall of Fame in 2001. Escoffery passed away at her home in Brown’s Town in 2002.

Next Event is June 15, 2013!
NTYDTTRD was founded in Jan 2012 to promote firearms safety and education, as well as family bonding through participation in an exciting and fun sport. Our inaugural event was held Jun 9, 2012, with 37 ranges in 15 states participating. It took thousands of volunteers, sponsors and supporters but it was worth it to see the smiles on the faces of the kids and the parents.
We started with a focus on Daughters and an opportunity for Dad’s to take their girls to the range and quickly evolved into Sons and Moms, too! The name hasn.
NTYDTTRD, Inc is the founding organization behind the event and we are a non-profit entity. We truly appreciate every donation, no matter how big or small, and we make every effort to stretch our limited funds as far as possible. If you can help, please consider clicking the Donate Here button on the side of this screen, or contacting us directly about mailing a check or an in-kind donation. We are not yet certified by the IRS as a 501c3, as we have not met the donation threshold but we will be filing for status as soon as possible. Please understand that it can take 9-12 months for the IRS to adjudicate the filing, and we will notify all donors of any status change when it occurs. In the interim, we are starting to plan for next year and really need your support to get us going.
We learned a lot from our first event and can’t wait to implement some of the changes going forward. One thing that will not change is the focus on SAFETY as the number 1 goal, and FUN a close second. We will continue to ask host ranges to agree to provide extra instructors and Safety Officers for their events.
We would also like to welcome Laura Carson to the Board of Directors. She brings a wealth of knowledge and skills in education and child development and will be instrumental in helping to plan and structure events in the future.

The blog turned 3 years old (it’s just a toddler!) on January 15th, and I’d say it’s not too late to celebrate. Three years ago, I was a petrified first year doctoral student, sitting in the back of my first year doctoral seminar, feeling alone, out of place, young, and in many ways voiceless. I had left the warm safety of my Stanford community, a community where I was surrounded by Native students, a community where I was known and accepted, where I felt that I had support for Native issues and there was always someone wiser, or more experienced I could call upon when a question or issue arose. I arrived in a cold–literally and figuratively–and isolated space where I suddenly was (and still am) the only Native student in my program. I suddenly had no one else to turn to when a questionable comment was made in class or when I encountered classmates at my elite institution who had never met a Native person in their lives. Those experiences, coupled with the fact that I was several years younger than my classmates and the only student in my cohort without a masters degree, left me silent and scared. I often wondered if I had made the right choice in going to graduate school, and this resulted in that my first year, I said–truly–three comments in class. Ever.
It was in this space that the blog was born. I had always felt passionate about representations of Native peoples, but approached it from more of an art and museum context. I interned at museums all throughout undergrad, and did my senior paper on contemporary Indian art that challenged stereotypes and questioned how outside western forces were shaping what constituted “authentic Indian art.” I think this interest came, and still stems, from the fact that I never saw myself, my friends, or my family reflected in images of “Nativeness.” Most of the images of Native people I saw represented people in some mythical past, or as a one-sided stereotype, not the vibrant, diverse community I knew. After a trip to Urban Outfitters right across the square from my school, I felt like something clicked. I felt invisible as a Native person, because the only images my classmates and colleagues ever saw of Native people were the false stereotypes in fashion, advertising, and hollywood. To them, even subconsciously, Indians were flat commodities to be bought and sold, whether as a fake dreamcatcher, beef jerky, or a mascot, not real, living, contemporary people. So I decided to write about it.
Writing the blog gave me a voice. In my semi-anonymous space on the internet, I was free to question, be angry, and fight back–things I struggled to do in “real life.” I watched my notoriety and influence grow online, while in my day-to-day I was still the silent girl in the back of the classroom. Even today, many, if not most, of my classmates don’t know what I do outside our campus. My alter-ego of “Adrienne K.” is (or tries to be) a fierce warrior, though sometimes I feel the real-life Adrienne doesn’t always match up.
Thinking back to those first early posts, where I still didn’t have the proper language to push back on the stereotypes, where I was still learning to use my voice and perspective, it’s incredible to see how far we’ve come. I say we, because I would be nowhere without the community that has developed around Native Approps. The daily emails, the tweets, the facebook posts, and the comments, it is the community that keeps me going and writing. I’ve learned so much from my readers, because I acknowledge that I am still no expert in this field. Through a happy confluence of factors, somehow I’ve emerged as a voice and an activist, but this blog has been a process of learning for me as much as it has been for you. I stand on the shoulders of those who have been in this fight for decades, and I am forever indebted and grateful to the work of the strong women and men who have laid the groundwork for me to be here today. I, by no stretch of the imagination, am the first Native person to write and care about how we are represented, I just have picked up and joined in what has been going on for generations.
For those reasons, the “fame” part of the blog has never been something I’ve been comfortable with. I didn’t start writing with some dreams of grandeur, and I still am super awkward when folks I meet in real life mention they read the blog. Actually, I’m just pretty awkward generally. All I am is a big nerd who found an outlet for that nerdiness, I swear. I reiterate again and again that I don’t claim to speak for all of Indian Country, that I just speak for my experience, which is one of several million perspectives that could be represented here. I think that’s one of the hardest things I’ve been learning to navigate–the tension between wanting to be heard, but not wanting to be seen as the only voice on Indian issues.
In the past three years we’ve covered a lot of ground. We’ve discussed young costumed non-Native powwow-goers, broke the story for the Navajo Nation Urban Outfitters lawsuit, talked about Halloween costumes, mascots, and random appropriations in-between. I caused a big stir by discussing my opinions of “Love in the Time of Blood Quantum,” one that’s left a lasting legacy of the now (in)famous term “unicorn” amongst my friends and acquaintances (though it may be time for an update on that post…). There was the (ongoing) Tonto fiasco, Victoria’s Secret, and Paul Frank. But the post that continues to be the biggest hit is my anti-hipster headdress manifesto, re-posted, linked, and reblogged all over the internet.
I would have never dreamed that I’d be on monthly conference calls with Paul Frank assisting in a Native artist collaboration, that I would have been a guest on a Al Jazeera or Native America Calling, interviewed Adam Beach, been interviewed by E! online, CNN, or any of the other “mainstream” outlets I’ve been privileged to chat with. I’ve been invited to speak at universities and conferences all over the country, where I’ve met incredible new friends and colleagues. I’ve gained technology skills, taught myself (basic) coding, learned the ins and outs of wordpress, learned how to manage social media platforms, how to build and cultivate a caring community, and curate content. I think it has taught me more about writing and refining my ideas than grad school ever could alone.
I’m listing this all off to remind myself how amazing it’s been, because admittedly it’s also been hard. I can’t separate the journey of the blog from my journey of grad school, and both have been fraught with tears over identity attacks, feelings of inadequacy, lack of confidence in myself and my ideas, and far too many moments where I thought it would be so much easier to stop everything and try and return to and salvage my previous life back in California.
As for what the future of Native Appropriations will hold, I have some grand plans and big ideas, but I also have to graduate. Since the blog is not exactly a cash cow, I also am balancing taking courses, multiple jobs as a teaching assistant, being an editor at an academic journal, doing my dissertation research, applying for funding for this and next year, and writing my qualifying paper and dissertation proposal. Any of which could be a full time job. But I somehow continue to find time, and will continue to find time, because I care deeply about this work and find so much strength and joy in the real change we are making for Native peoples.
What I hope for the future is that we can continue to learn together, that I can offer my ideas and perspectives as a starting point, but that the conversation will grow outward and not stay within the confines of the blog. I hope that my dedication to this world can bleed into my academic life, where the 1900+ words I’ve written here are more than I’ve written for my qualifying paper in months. Writing on the blog, strangely enough, is freeing. Despite the fact that thousands of people read my intimate thoughts online, and are not shy about sharing their hate for me and my opinions, it doesn’t scare me. What scares me is my dissertation committee, the classmates to whom I felt inferior, and the ivy-covered world I live in. Internet trolls? Bring it. The Committee on Degrees? Excuse me, I’m going back to bed.
For the daily fear that I live in of not being good enough in my academic life, I sometimes forget to celebrate the joy and accomplishments this world has brought. Native Appropriations has given me confidence and a voice when I felt marginalized and silenced in my everyday life. It has connected me on a deeper level to my own identity, and forced me to defend who I am and what I care about, making me stronger and braver. I’ve become an activist and a writer, when I only sought out to share images of what we are not.
I feel that we are on the edge of something big as Indigenous Peoples. If the Idle No More movement is any indication, we are ready to rise up and be seen and heard, not content to be silenced any longer. I know that I’m ready, and feel confident that I am ready to be a part of, or help to create, whatever comes next. Pushing back on Native representations is just the beginning. Our rights, lands, women, and cultures have been violated for far too long, and I know the time is now for things to change.
So thank you for joining me on this journey–for reading, commenting, emailing, and discussing. For spreading these issues to your family, friends, and colleagues, and making cultural appropriation an issue worthy of discussion and change. For making it to the end of this behemoth of a post. Here’s to the next three years and beyond.

The Great Cholesterol Myth
Last year, cardiologist Stephen Sinatra and I came together to write a book, The Great Cholesterol Myth: Why Lowering Cholesterol Won’t Prevent Heart Disease and the Statin-Free Plan That Will. We believe that a weird mixture, and sugar. These are things we can actually do something about with food, supplements, and lifestyle changes, none of which have the costs or break with conventional thinking for a minute, consider the following study, just one of the many we discuss in the book.
The Lyon Diet-Heart Study
In the 1990s, French researchers decided to run an experiment known as the Lyon Diet-Heart Study to test the effect of different diets on heart disease.
They took two groups of men who had every imaginable risk factors, vegetables, and monounsaturated fat like olive oil. even more inflammation which creates more oxidative damage in a vicious cycle that eventually results in plaque and an increased risk for heart disease. If there was no inflammation, there would be no plaque.
The other two major promoters of heart disease are stress and sugar. Stress releases hormones which harm the artery walls and increase blood pressure. (Stress may be the explanation for why 40 percent of atherosclerotic patients literally tiny hormone factories, spitting out inflammatory cytokines and increasing overall inflammation and arterial damage.
The following is my seven-point program for reducing the risk of heart disease. Note that lowering cholesterol isn’t on it. (Note also that managing stress is.) Pay attention to these seven action items, and you just may find that you don’t need to worry quite so much about cholesterol after all.
Jonny’s 7-point program to reduce the risk of heart disease
1. Eat an anti-inflammatory diet.
2. Reduce grains, starches, sugar, and omega-6s.
3. Manage your stress.
4. Exercise.
5. Drink only in moderation.
6. Don’t smoke.
7. Supplement with antioxidants, vitamin C, coenzyme Q10, omega-3s.
Speaking of supplements …
Ask your typical mainstream doctor about nutritional supplements and the first thing you’re likely to hear is this: “There’s no good research showing they work.” I have heard this refrain time and time again when I discuss nutritional medicine with my more conservative colleagues.
It’s not true.
You or your doctor can go online to the National Institute of Medicine’s library, pubmed.com, and put into the search box virtually any vitamin or herb you can think of. Depending on what you choose, hundreds to thousands of citations will pop up. So the problem isn’t an absence of research.
The problem is twofold. One, the conventional training of medical doctors in this country is highly biased toward pharmaceuticals. And two, like that can help keep people healthy.
Many supplements are particularly important for heart health. Here’s a short guide to the most important ones. If you’re not taking these, perhaps you should be.
Omega -3s: the wellness molecule
Omega-3s are among the most anti-inflammatory substances on the planet and should be part of everyone’s heart-healthy supplement program.
Coenzyme Q10: fuel for the heart
Coenzyme Q10 is needed to make cellular energy, and: the energy maker
D-Ribose is a five-carbon sugar and is one of the components of ATP, the energy molecule the body uses to power all activities. Without D-ribose, there is no ATP. Without ATP, there is no energy.
L-Carnitine: the energy transport system: the great relaxer
Magnesium lowers blood pressure, helps control blood sugar, and relaxes the lining of the blood vessels. Magnesium also inhibits platelet aggregation, which is helpful in preventing the development of clots. Almost all dietary surveys show that Americans aren’t getting nearly enough magnesium.
Pantethine: your secret weapon
Pantethine is a metabolically active (and somewhat more expensive) form of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). Pantethine reduces the oxidation of LDL. No fewer than twenty-eight clinical trials in humans have shown that pantethine produces significant positive changes in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol.
Vitamin C: powerful antioxidant
Vitamin C is one of the most powerful antioxidants in the world, and because heart disease is initiated by damage caused by free radicals (oxidative damage), any help you can get in the antioxidant department is a good thing indeed.
And it’s not just theoretical: a large 2011 study in the American Heart Journal found that the lower the level of vitamin C in the blood, the higher the risk for heart failure.
Curcumin: the new superstar of supplements
This extract from the Indian spice turmeric has multiple benefits, not the least of which is that it’s highly anti-inflammatory., and it’s available in supplements like Terry Naturally.. Not a bad résumé!
It’s both a strong antioxidant and a strong anti-inflammatory, inhibiting a number of inflammatory enzymes that can contribute to heart disease. The recommended dose is at least 250 mg a day of trans-resveratrol, the active component of resveratrol. Read labels carefully: many won’t tell you how much resveratrol is of the trans- variety. One brand I particularly like is Reserverage, which comes in two strengths and provides either 250 mg or 500 mg of the trans- form in every capsule.
Cocoa flavanols: nitric oxide booster
Plant chemicals in cocoa known as flavanols help the body synthesize a compound called nitric oxide, which is critical for healthy blood flow and healthy blood pressure. Nitric oxide also improves platelet function, making your blood less sticky. It also makes the lining of the arteries less attractive for white blood cells to attach to and stick around. You can get these heart-healthy flavanols in dark chocolate containing at least 60 percent cocoa. One manufacturer, CocoaWell, provides cocoa flavanols in several excellent formulas, including one that incorporates 100 mg of coenzyme Q10.
The bottom line
Lowering cholesterol and lowering the risk of heart disease are very far from the same thing.
The latter is important.
The former is almost irrelevant.

Tie-down event lifts Bates to all-around title
By Quentin Jodie
Navajo Times
WINDOW ROCK, September 13, 2012
(Special to the Times – Donovan Quintero)
SECOND FROM TOP: Fort Defiance, Ariz, breakaway roper Serena Dahozy slams the brakes after getting her calf roped on Sunday at the 66th annual Navajo Nation Fair Rodeo in Window Rock. Dahozy posted a 3.2 second run.
THIRD FROM TOP: Saddle bronc rider Cody Roy Hendren of Albuquerque failed to mark out his draw during the short round of the 66th annual Navajo Nation Fair Rodeo in Window Rock.
M ichael Bates is a top-notch steer wrestler.
That was pretty much a given before this year's Navajo Nation Fair as the 23 year-old Mexican Springs N.M. cowboy earned national qualifications for both the high school and collegiate ranks.
His tie-down roping skills, on the other hand, have been a work in progress.
But he knew that if he could get three good draws in that event, he would have a chance.
Turns out, his performance was nothing short of brilliant as he won the average race in both of his events. And to that end, he was named the men's all-around champion on Sunday afternoon during the 66th annual Navajo Nation Fair.
"I had a pretty good day," said Bates, who pocketed a grand total of $8,846.52. "Everything just clicked for me.
By virtue of finishing on top, Bates will be competing in the 8th annual International Indian Finals Rodeo this weekend in the steer wrestling and tie-down event. The first performance will start on Friday night inside Tingley Coliseum as all the average winners will take park of this grand event.
Prior to this year, Bates said he never gotten close to winning the all-around title here at the NNF, but after he tied up his calf in the short round with an 11.5 second run it became apparent that he had cinched up that title.
"This is my best finish ever," he said. Before this year "I made it as far as the second round in the calf roping, but I just wanted to make a couple good runs today and have the all-around fall where it should."
In his signature event, he tied with Ganado steer wrestler Garrison Begay for second place in the short round with a 4.9 run.
With that he won the average with a 14.3 effort on three heads and netted $3760.22.
"In the first round I drew a very good steer," Bates said. "The second steer was fast and I knew he was going to run and in the short round, I felt like I had a chance."
Behind three solid runs, Tyron Tsosie nabbed second place honor with an 18.1 aggregate. The Crownpoint bull dogger won the short round in 4.5 seconds and after it was all said and done he took home $2,300.36.
Begay, meanwhile, finished third in the average with an 18.7 and cleared $1,452.64. He finished ahead of Mike Holyan (22.8), Myron Lee (23.8) and Kyle Dennison (24.1).
In the final four showdown, Begay won an additional $2,000 as he turned his steer in 4.2 seconds.
"I already knew that I drew a good steer," the Greasewood Springs cowboy said. "I figured I would throw him with a three, but I was a four on him and I'll take that."
Bates finished a close second with a 4.8 while Tsosie turned in a 5.3 run and Holyan posted a no time.
Just like the steer wrestling, Bates won the tie-down event in similar fashion.
After coming back as the second-high call back, he turned in a sizzling run of 11.5 seconds in the championship round and placed fourth.
"I just had to go out there and make sure I got him wrapped," Bates said of his short round draw.
Bates finished his three-run average in 33.4 seconds, which paid him a grand $3,086.30.
Ft. Defiance cowboy Roderick Tso won the short round with a 8.6 and placed fifth in the average with a 37.2 run on three heads.
Kenny Glasses finished second in the average and lost the title by two-tenths of a second with a 33.6 aggregate. But the Rough Rock, Ariz., cowboy claimed the final four with a 9.9 effort and netted $4,334.29 with two grand coming in the showdown.
"I was just trying to be consistent," Glasses said. "The last calf I drew in the short round, it gave me problems so I tried to make the most of it on my final calf."
Despite losing the title by the slimmest margin, Glasses said he was real pleased with his finish.
"It seems like I've been struggling the last two rodeos," he said. "They were pretty big rodeos, but this is not too bad at all. I'll go at again next year."
Third place honors in the average went to Mike Holyan (36.1) as he finished ahead of uncle Ed Holyan (36.9) while Leroy Etsitty rounded out the top six with a 38.0 effort.
In the team roping, Aaron Tsinigine and Victor Begay capped a perfect week by winning both the average title and the final four showdown. As a token, both competitors are scheduled to make an appearance at this year's IIFR finals.
The pair stretched their short round draw in 4.3 seconds for top honors and finished the average race in 15.2 seconds, which was 1.1 seconds better than the effort turned in by Chris Begay and O.J. Williams.
"My header did a really good job," Begay said. "He's a good header and you know after our first draw we started to heat things up. After that I was just having fun."
At press time, the results for the second round were not available, but for three rounds of roping the Tsinigine and Begay pair won a whopping $6,202.13, which included two grand in the final four series.
In that round they recorded a 4.2 run while Chuck Sells and OJ Williams posted a 5.2 run. The team of Tedson Yazzie/Clarence Yazzie and the Chris Begay/OJ Williams pair both posted no times.
With an 18.7 run on three head, the Yazzie pair finished third in the average race ahead of the Sells and Williams pair who posted a 19.5 run. In fifth place Jason Yazzie and Wacey Brady nabbed fifth place honors.

2008/09 Memphis Grizzlies Payroll: $44 million
2008/09 Estimated Salary Cap: $58 million
Roughly $14 million under cap
[img_assist|nid=1161|title=Rudy Gay|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=300|height=451]
The Good:
The Bad:
The Future:
Free Throw:
The Grizzlies didn’t improve their win total of 22 from last season, but let’s give them a break; they were in the toughest division in the NBA and their best player was traded for peanuts. Despite the doom and gloom, there are still some bright spots on this Memphis team.
Take Rudy Gay, for example. Gay defined the term “breakout season” by filling up a box score like few players in the league can; 20.2 points, 6.2 rebounds, 1.4 steals, 1.0 block, 46% shooting and a respectable 35% from downtown. Suddenly, the Shane Battier trade looks a lot better. Memphis has found one of their cornerstones and he is still under his rookie contract for two more seasons. If he can prove this year wasn’t a fluke, Gay will be an All-Star very soon.
Although he was surrounded by trade rumors this year, the Grizzlies managed to hang on to Mike Miller and he continued to shoot the lights out. With stellar percentages like 50% from the field and 43% from long range, Miller has solidified himself as one of the best shooters in the game. As a plus, he also averaged a career-high 6.7 rebounds. At $9 million for next season and $9.75 million the year after, Miller earns his contract very well. Even a franchise as inept as Memphis recognizes a good shooter when they see one.
Speaking of inept, how about that Pau Gasol trade! When a deal is so lopsided that other teams in the league publically protest it, you know it must not be good. Sure, they got Kwame Brown’s $9 million expiring contract, but where is the player for your future? The Wolves got Al Jefferson and the Nets got Devin Harris, so where is the player for the Grizzlies’? Javaris Crittenton isn’t even the third best point guard on the team and may not be part of their future plans. The draft pick Memphis got might as well be in the second round and the pick in 2010 probably won’t be much better. There simply wasn’t enough there to warrant trading a player of Pau Gasol’s caliber (unless his brother, Marc Gasol, turns out to be Pau’s clone).
Can we get some lottery love for Memphis one of these years? In 2003, they missed out on LeBron and had to give up their pick. Last year, they had the best chance to land Oden or Durant, but wound up picking fourth. This year, they had a pretty good shot at Beasley or Rose, but they drop a spot to pick five. I think this round of bad luck is due to rotten Karma left over from the Gasol trade.
The bad news doesn’t end there. Darko Milicic is the second highest paid player on the team and his mediocre averages of 7.2 points and 6.1 rebounds don’t quite live up to the monetary expectations. Milicic is owed $14.5 million over the next two years. How does a seven-foot post player only shoot 43.8% from the field? Maybe he can take a page out of Rudy Gay’s book and finally have that breakout season we’ve all been waiting for.
Jason Collins and Brian Cardinal add up to one big wad of wasted cap space. Not that the Grizzlies really need it at this point, but it would be nice not having to pay $12.5 million to those two so they can wait at the end of the bench for their garbage minutes. The team will also owe Cardinal $6.75 million after next season. Yikes.
One positive about the Gasol trade was that it definitely opened up a lot of salary cap space for the Grizzlies. The question is, will they use it? All that cap space doesn’t mean diddly if it’s not used to sign better players. That doesn’t mean you go out and overpay for someone like Antawn Jamison. The money must be used wisely. Look no further than Brian Cardinal for a lesson in poor spending.
There is hope here. Gay and Miller are an excellent 2-3 scoring combo. With Mike Conley, Kyle Lowry, and Juan Carlos Navarro, the Grizzlies are loaded with young point guards. One of them should rise to the top and be the clear starter. The biggest need for Memphis lies in the post. The crop of free-agent big men will probably be light this summer, so the team will look to the draft for help. Unfortunately for Grizzlies fans the team appears to be targeting Kevin Love with the 5th overall selection. And while Love should be an instant contributor, his upside is questionable, and taking him at five is an enormous reach.
During the first eight years of the franchise, they never won more than 28 games. Over the next three seasons, they won between 45 and 50 games. Then, in the past two seasons, they won just 22 each time. There is no steady rise or slow decline for the Grizzles, it’s boom or bust.
Grade: B
Main State of the Cap Page
The Bad:
The Future:
Free Throw:
With that amount under the cap, I wonder what they might be attempting to do? Perhaps making a run to bring one of the great players who will become free agents in the next off-season. Hopefully, they can make something happen and make a run at getting into the postseason sometime in the future. Ha ha. I gotta say, that's a large sum of money....what are they gonna do with it?
The Grizzlies suck look for another 22 win season lol...

Just a handful of youngsters have made it into the next stage (Top 16) of Eurolegue competition. We will continue to take a look at those who did with their respective teams, in our weekly report.

Los Angeles Lakers are a legendary, heavily bannered team, and with that honor comes the special distinction of having fans from all around the world; this entails no matter where the Lakers go for games — if it be Denver, Portland, Chicago — there are going to be Lakers fans in the crowd.
Lakers fans often times come across as entitled beings, and have a rough start doesn’t suit well with them; and one fan was extremly annoyed after the Utah Jazz-Los Angeles Lakers game Wednesday night via.
This guy isn’t the example of every Laker fan, in fact, most won’t resort to spraying you with pepper spray, that’s not to say they aren’t annoying.
I have said this before, if you are a fan of the visiting team, you HAVE to expect trash talk. It happens at EVERY game I have ever attended, but there’s a difference from throwing verbal barbs and doing something this idiotic.

Florida's political scene is like a poop fight at the monkey house. No wonder a simple thing like counting votes is a huge ordeal for them.
When it is all said and done, the good news is that President Obama took Florida! Well done!
It's almost as if they tried to deter voting. Reduce early voting days by nearly half for a presidential election???
If at first you don't succeed try, try again. In Florida's case, they won't stop until they get it right, that is, to completely drown out democracy and make the election go the way that they want it to go......in their state at least.
Florida is a good state because even if their state government tries to cheat the voters out of their right to vote, the repubs still lose. They cheated Bush into office and look what that did for our country, you would think, after awhile, even they would learn!!
The red counties are where all the r e t a r d s with tatoos and missing teeth live.
.
It will take a constitutional ammendment to get partisan hands off of the voting process. All eligible voters should be registered automatically, and the list constantly updated. Voting should be mandatory with a $100 fee for not voting. This fee will pay for the whole process easily at current voting rates, with the remainder going solely to reduce the national debt.
The only snafu is the sore loser complex!
A voting taxation? Not voting is in itself a type of vote. Making it mandatory would be foolish. We shouldn't be forcing people to vote if their political views do not align with one of the candidates.
Did any of you notice that Florida got in a part of the voting law that allows the people to look and compare signatures and if they don't look the same they can be thrown out. Now after 40 years my signature looks nothing like it did when I first voted. Of course, I want to point out that back then it was called a literacy test and was still allowed in the South only until the Supreme Court ruling, outlawing it! Now we have gotten it in the North. Totally Un-Constitutional. I refuse to sign and use an X. It is legal !
Florida is the home base of Rush Limbaugh, self-hating homosexual Matt Drudge, and a summer home for the kooky Ann Coulter. Hmmm, why is this a surprise? Load up all the senior citizens in the nursing homes and lets go vote-- Florida state Motto.
What happened to the Republican mantra "Less Government" It looks like the republicans got over involved in the voting process and Fu<&ed it up.
Yup, the people who are yelling smaller are making it bigger.
Don't forget Mike Huckebee now lives in a $3 million dollar mansion he had built in Destin ,FL. I lived in Pensacola 2009 - 2011, never in my life have I met so many racists & homophobes as I did in the FL panhandle (lower Alabama is what they call the panhandle), they are still pissed about the Civil War !
Sounds to me like the republicans were trying to make it difficult for the democrats to vote. Cutting early voting time, limited of voting places, Wording out the ballet so it takes longer to vote.
Republicans have shown themselves to be the slime of the country in so many ways. Oh, yea, blocking anything they can to make the president look bad for the last couple of years no matter what the cost to the economy, but that was their agenda.
So nice to see they got spanked.
Raise your swords up high.
"a poop fight at the monkey house", but those are the best and most fun fights there are :P.
What else do you expect from the penis of America. We even have a dick for a governor that stole billions from a program designed to help people in need. I am impressed that Florida will go to Obama, not to mention the nation. It was close, hopefully is will be a good thing.
Republicans control Florida so what else can we expect. They do not want to let any one other than republicans to win. I drove around my city and found long lines in the minority sections and ease of voting and short lines in Repub areas in cold weather. I watched one line for over an hour in a minority area and not one person got out of line in frustration. Congradulations to all of those who stood for the right wings crap got out and voteed and showed them we cannot let you buy elections. You are the true American.
I have to wonder about this part of the story:
Why not do like we do in the USVI, and I think some mainland states do the same...close the damned schools on election day and use them as the polling locations. After all, the taxpayers are paying for those public facilities.
UnitesStates1776, you're a third class moron.
I had to vote a provisional ballot here because when I went to vote my name was not on the list. I registered about two years ago the same day, same place, same time as my wife. My wife is registered as a Republican; I'm not. She had no problem voting. Since Florida still hasn't counted the ballots, I doubt they've even looked at mine. I feel cheated.
By the way Florida Republicans, the joke's on you: My wife voted straight Democratic.
Another red state turning blue.
God bless America.
The Supervisor of Elections for Miami-Dade is NOT a Republican. Actually, the counties where things have been most messed up in the past have been primarily ran by democrats.
S FL counties were given an extra day, where other counties in FL were not.
The polls in Miami-Dade officially finally closed at 1:30AM (according to S FL news). The local news showed pictures of a polling station at 8:00PM after closing and then showed another at 11:00PM. The news video supposedly made at 11 showed more people in line waiting than at 8:00. Someone was also supposedly collecting paper ballots outside and telling people they would submit the ballots for the persons but not checking names against the list. All stories being talked about in S FL but not getting much national attention.
I'm just thankful that the Nation wasn't dependent on FL as that might had brought the spotlight on the irregularities and deciding the winner may have been even worse than the whole Bush v. Gore mess.
Florida, where all the rich F^CK's retire, gee, imagine that!
Thanks Mike for pointing out some facts. Miami-Dade is a huge Democrat controlled area.
It's hard to believe that a state that's governed by a super-smart, free- market loving, ace businessman can't seem to run something as simple as an election. Of course, in fairness, Florida has only had 12 years to come to grips with the debacle of 2000.
If I didn't know better, I might think that Rick Scott was the kind of guy who would defraud the government and engage in voter suppression.
I'm a Democrat but what is funny is my best friends are Republicans GO FIGURE, oh by the way they did not vote, they were mad that their party was trying to kill Obama-care, I think that may have been why Romney lost ... Oh well ....
Next time have two separate voting sheets, one for the president vote and one for constitutional changes, then they can take their jolly time counting the second one.
They can't figure out the rules of the road so why should we expect them to actually be able to fill out a ballot. Bet they know the lottery system though.
UnitedStates1776 said: "The red counties are where all the r e t a r d s with tatoos and missing teeth live."
The blue ones are where all of the illegal and dead Democrats live.
Florida once again shows how inadequate and inept they are at anything .Nice place to visit but almost as whacked as California. I say lets just skip Florida. Wait we have already done that.
So...by Saturday, for sure?
Jeb, I thought we knew ya!
as a floridian for 11 yrs., i can't even argue with any negative comment here. this entire state is so screwed up on so many levels, it's not even worth putting up with for the weather; florida is a perfect example of "it's a nice place to visit but i wouldn't want to live there".
"Amen" brother Celt Amen!
Also the insects and the alligators
Interesting that GOP strategists think Jeb Bush should run next time around. Now, what could possibly go wrong in Florida in 2016? Get it the fvck together 'cause we don't elect presidents from third world countries either!
1. Give Florida back to Spain. Problems solved.
2. Make Puerto Rico a state. The flag stays the same. No changes needed.
Let Spain deal with them. Payback for taking the "Black Swan" sunken treasure money.
Born and raised in Florida and I even have to go WTF?????
Common Sense from above: "It almost looks like they were trying to deter voting" .... I know your intentons were good but that is one of the most naive comments I've seen here ..... OF COURSE Republicans were trying to "deter" voting by minorities and middle class common folk, this was total manipulation by making it harder to vote.
The Florida Election apparatus needs to be investigated and brought up on charges of tampering with the federal election process, and those officials found guilty banned from ever over seeing any election again. The Federal Justice System should look into filing a Federal Suit to take the right of Florida to operate Federal Elections in the future.
politics as usual for republicans, did u really think they would go away quietly?
What made me rethink was in hearing the majority of the elderly voted republican. The republicans made it clear their social security and medicare would be safe from cuts if they were over 55, so they decided to toss the rest of us under the bus.
Florida and Arizona have become cess pools of Republican corruption and incompetence. Why any clear thinking American can continue to support the Republican Party baffles me............
The GOP is not only a crimnal organization it's also a contagious disease that must be eradicated.
What an embarrassment. I remember when the United States was a "shining city on the hill", a beacon for democracies around the world to follow. Now, thanks to our collective incompetence, as typified in the dysfunctional banana republic of Florida when it comes to running elections, we are not only a laughing stock; but we fuel the mockery of what we now laughingly claim as our own values in which our Jihadist enemies revel.
well, it took so long to bus in all the illegals to vote, then they couldn't read the ballot, then they couldn't count the ballots...but hey, YOU wanted them!!
Since Obama is ahead in the count in Florida, I wonder if the Supreme Court would have stepped in and handed the election to Obama like they did for Bush if Florida were needed to win the presidency? I'd bet not.
@ FedupwithFed
Either you're a very sore loser or talking out of your anal canal. Florida requires a photo ID and/or a signature voter registration card issued by the board of elections to vote. The problem with voting this time was the number of issues on the ballot that required 12 pages and the small number of voting booths that could not handle the number of voters. On top of that Rick Scott would not extend the voting days and even tried to reduce the number of hours the polls were open. Thankfully none of that worked because people of both parties insisted they be allowed to vote.
What gets me is that Florida has a population of 19 million. California has a population of almost 38 million. Polls closed here in California at 8pm and within 15 mins we knew who won. I know we ain't no poster child for perfect state but damn, Florida, how do you f*ck things up that badly?
I might also add that the presidency had already been decided before the last person voted election night so the poll workers packed up and went home to count the votes later.
@Chris
Unless my memory fails me, Obama was declared the winner of California the minute the polls were closed before any votes were counted.
Amazing that some many people are totally ignorant about the fact that the ONLY counties in Florida that are having problems with voting are DEMOCRATIC counties. That is true for every presidential election since BUSH/GORE. Those are the facts.
Larry, I LIVE in Florida and I was a poll watcher....I SAW what was happening!
so who is talking out of their ass???
@ FedupwithFed - If you are a poll watch as you claim, (since nobody would ever lie on a blog to bolster non-existent credentials) you are personally responsible for allowing these alleged illegal immigrants to vote.
It's far more likely that you're a simpering redneck bigot that nobody takes seriously and who cannot fathom the fact that these assorted brown peoples are better educated, better people and better Americans than you are yourself.
anti trust
It's interesting that there are accessibility issues. Seems Florida has had some stricter codes on accessibility than many states for quite some time.
Fed up
You think you have problems? In the Polling places republican poll watchers were kicked out of in Pennsylvania and Ohio end up with 99% and 100% of votes for Obama.
You probably really loved the UN observer's comment of "Why don't you have a requirement for voter photo ID's.
We are officially a banana republic.
We have to get RICK SCOTT OUT OF OFFICE!
So basically it amounts to Florida and Gov. Rick Scott did everything in their power to suppress Democratic votes (e.g., reducing early voting days, reducing polling locations, voter ID to prevent non-existant voter fraud, etc.) and all it did was galvanize Democratic voters to show up in droves, wait in long lines, cast absentee ballots, and give the state of Florida and it's 29 electoral votes to President Obama while simultaneously making Florida the laughing stock of the democratic world...
Congrats Gov. Scott, a resounding victory if I do say so myself...
...
This is total bull@!$%# I might add. Illegals cannot vote, lie more Fed...
Fedupwithfed. if you where correct, which you are not, that would mean that immigrants who can't speak English are still smarter then republicans. think about your statements lol
That's the wonderful thing about electronic voting. Not like it mattered but California was overwhelmingly Dem. Romney had zero chance of collecting Cali's electoral, which is why he spent almost no time campaigning here.
As for the Presidency being decided before the last votes were in. Of course it was. The Electoral count was already over 270 for Obama with several blue states yet to submit. At that point it was a forgone conclusion.
Once Florida gets it's head out of it's ass, it's 29 EV's will most likely go to Obama as well. Giving him 332 in the end. There was no way in hell Romney would have won. That was obvious to pretty much everyone even without those last few state results.
Though the 2nd best thing that night was watching Rove make an idiot out of himself.
It is not that the counties having trouble are democratic counties it is that they have the largest number of voters and the largest visability. Some voters here in Florida were screaming voter surpression for months. Starting with ID's which requried original birth, wedding, and SS card documents, plus $25. That's $50 for a couple to vote. Poll tax? Gov. Rick Scott, a former G. W. Bush business partner, would not allow additional voting days or hours, even after one poll had to be closed for a bomb squad to explode to packages. Scott, who was CEO of HCA hospital company which had the largest Medicare fraud payment in history, was not even charged. Of course, Scott's former business partner was the sitting President Bush. The Republican legislature put these regulations this year to take the heat off of 2016, when Jeb Bush will be considered for President.
This was not not just two counties. The RNC hired a consulting firm which got its hand in the ballot box, and fired them in Florida, (they had used this firm in all the swing states). The only hope for Florida to have an honest election in 2016 is to get a democratic swing in the legislature in the next election. They have taken the mentality that winning is not everything it is the ONLY thing. It seems to be just a fun game for the Republicans in Florida.
Ok, So, I was reading some of the comments on how our ancesters came here illegally and the rightful one's to be here are the Native Americans. Well, if we sit and think about it. Even the Native American's are here illegally, because if the history books stand correct we all came from apes in Africa. They came to North America from a land bridge. So, I quess we should all start packing our bags and head back to Africa. This is about legally becoming an American. Our ancesters that came here in a boat had to wait in line for days just to get a number identifying who they are and get degrating physicals in front of hundreds even thousands of others. They didnt just get off the boat and make a mad dash for the hills then feel entitled to get money from our country just because they are illegally here. No one said they couldnt come back, they can when they follow the rules and become an American legally.
George PaulJohn,
Are you serious? Asking Fedupwithfed to think is a little extreme. Wouldn't you say?
I've lived in Florida for 42 years. I don't want to hear how Dade county's election problems are caused by Democrats. All of Florida's notorious election problems are caused by Republican dirty tricks. Dade County especially, because they are the Democratic stronghold in Florida.
Early voting in my county of Manatee was a very bad joke. One poll opened in the entire County with 3 or 4 hour lines every single day. If ever there was a cause for discouraging citizen participation, I can think of nothing more effective. All of this because of Republican efforts of sabotage in Tallahassee.
Florida election 2000 seemed to be an anomaly. This repeat 12 years later proves it is deliberate. Washington must pass a law allowing the feds to take over elections in any state proven unable to provide this fundamental exercise in Democracy.
Frankly the poles should open at 6:00 AM on the first Monday of November, closing at 11:00 PM, and maintain those hours every day through the following Sunday. Seven days of voting and expanded hours. Voting hours and days should be the same in EVERY state, also. It is too important to have so narrow a window, just a few hours on one day.
There are many variables preventing people from getting there on one specific day; illness, unexpected travel for work, family death, etc. If people had a week we would have far greater participation in our system.
No matter your political views, the one thing I believe we should agree upon is that we need to be allowed to cast our vote and be part of the democratic process.
Voting in a Presidential election in the United States? Easy as wrapping ones legs around ones head, then walking a few miles on ones ass. The people of Zimbabwe have to be laughing their asses off. Wanna vote? Anyone? No! Not you! You don't look like you'd vote like I wish you to! You're a phony! No? Prove to me you're not! Gwaddamn republicans!
In Ohio, Husted tried the same things. It was part of the Republican agenda to get votes thrown out. Fortunately, a federal judge has called Husted and his cronies to the mat, and is demanding an explanation. A federal judge had previously denied Husted obstructionist agenda, and then Husted tried another end run the Friday night (at 7 p.m.) before the elections the following Tuesday. This behavior was so blatant that it staggers my imagination. Truly, these acts of desperation reveal the true face of the Republican party.
lol... a must watch for those observing florida voting process!
1. Rick Scott did everything he could to suppress the vote. It still amazes me that some of the idiots in my community actually voted for someone who took the 5th 75 times in the biggest Medicare Medicaid fraud case up until that time, his company settled on a $1,700,000,000 dollar fine and he was forced to resign. I asked someone I know how he could vote for him knowing about the fraud case, his answer was "they're all crooks", yeah so wouldn't you want to vote for the crook smart enough to not get caught.
2.These 11 constitutional amendments were very awkwardly worded so you really had to take your time with them, Should do your research before you go the polls. Ultimately almost all were an attempt at a power grab by the tea party, and a few were against the us constitution, that would have never been legal, and 1 would have allowed public funds for religious use with no accountability.
3. All the hold up is in Miami Dade county AKA the Banana Republic. All the other counties were done and counted on time.
Guess you people do not realize who populates FL & AZ??
Retirees from the Northeast & Mid-West.
In FL , they are the largest contingent of the voting community.
FL born voters constitute roughly 8% of the electorate.
So, If you live in the NE or Mid-West , and think FL's screwed up??
Look in the mirror , and look at the cause.
One has to wonder if officials have deliberately muddled the process. If Florida had been the deciding vote in this past election, how easy would it have been to manipulate the outcome?
As the article implies very strongly, the Republicans in Florida, who had control
of the governor's office, the legislature, and the chief of elections office,
did almost everything they could do, and blatantly so, to discourage Democrats
from voting. I agree.
In Pennsylvania, the legislature passed legislation shortly before the elections
requiring photo IDs along with substantial and unnecessary restrictions. One of
the Republican leaders publicly bragged about how that legislation would enable
the Republicans to win in Pennsylvania. A Republican judge finally stopped
enforcement for this election, but refused to stop those same officials from
continuing to publicly advertise the photo ID program, which allegedly continued
to confuse and intimidate many voters.
Those same Republican leaders hypocritically claimed the rationale for the photo ID was to prevent voter fraud. There is an expression, "It takes one to know
one."
When I voted (in PA), a sheet asking for the photo ID was on the table. I ignored it, but I wondered how many people could have been intimidated or confused by it, especially if they were a Democrat and the person behind the table was a Republican, especially if they were at home deciding whether to make the effort to go vote or not. That is not Democracy. It made me ashamed to be a Republican.
It is time for our legislators and law enforcement officials to do their jobs by
putting a stop to these flagrant abuses of Democracy.
I'll be changing soon to be an Independent.

I did that in 1969, life and at that time in OH, we were called GDI's...this will probably get me in trouble with the Code, but the full expression then was "those god damned independents." There were many general elections where I voted ONLY on ballot issues, and of course that is all that I could vote for in primaries...if there were any ballot issues. Here in the US Virgin Islands, we have an option on our ballots...NO VOTE (similar to Nevada's NONE OF THE ABOVE.) That has been my vote since 2000, when I realized that we had that option on our voting machines. And I encourage others to cast the same vote if there is no one that they feel comfortable really voting for.
Here in Nevada We had to show our ID and sign so the signature could be verified, and this was at a Mexican Learning center.
We also had to show ID and sign in Florida. Voting at the polls as a regular, registered voter was easy. But we must vote Rick Scott out of office at our first opportunity! Even his supporters now wonder WTF they were thinking.
What a disorganized, crooked madhouse!
If this operation were a normal business, those responsible for the whole mess would have been fired days ago.
Take action and do something NOW about this criminality, Floridians! (And don't just sit back and wait for your next opportunity to "vote" for different people in charge, since this obviously isn't a very workable or reliable solution for you there!)
Don't fool yourself that a vote for a third party, or none of the above is a real vote. No one cares about protest votes. Ralph Nader, Pat Buchanan or Johnson just took votes from one or other of the two who could win. Sometimes, like McCain's mother said, "You just have to hold your nose and vote". Sometimes, there are issues that make you disagree strongly with a person that is in the general direction that you want. The other person may want, however, to go the other way. There are total overall differences. Stand up and make a choice, not a snarky NO choice.
I live in rural (always red) Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was a state that passed, then temporarily stopped, voter ID laws. My mother was born on a Native American reservation and has no registered birth certificate. She is 80 years old and a registered Democrat who has voted in every election since she came of age including the last mid-term elections.
About a year ago she decided it was time to give up driving so, not thinking of the consequences, cut up her license. When the ID law came into effect I sent for a duplicate license for her; this was five weeks prior to the election, because she could not get a 'voter ID card' without her birth certificate. (her original license did not expire for another year and a half). The duplicate did not arrive and, even though the ID law was put on hold, I wanted her to have the ID. I called and called and every time I was told that it was "in the process".
The day of the election it still had not arrived. I drove her to the poll and, when we went in, there was a sign on the door stating that positive ID was required to vote. We ignored it and went to the desk. My mom's name and all of her information was in the ledger but there was a typed notation on her signature line that read: "Inactive" and instructed the poll worker to get positive ID.
After three of the other people in the polling place positively identified my mom (the town is only 4,500 people and we all know each other) the worker finally allowed her to vote. Mom's duplicate license came ... on Wednesday ... the day AFTER the election.
Voter suppression is real. Voting is one of the few rights left to us that allows us to have a say in the workings of our government. No matter the party affiliation, the one thing we should ALL agree upon is that our government does not have the right to stop us from casting our vote nor should they be allowed to make it difficult for the citizens.
I live in Florida and Governor Scott is a joke he caused this mess and refuses to admit it. I can't wait to vote his dumb ass out!
"and a state Republicans did win in 2010 – giving control of the legislature, the governor’s office and the choice of chief elections official to the Republicans"
Allowing one party or another to choose who the state election officials will be is pure lunacy. Not Party should control any aspect of a states election process without some sort of oversight from the other parties involved, and I don't just mean dems and repubs, all parties should have a hand in the election process.
Ali Baba Scott and his 40 thieves run Florida. They wanted to put the fix on for Karl Rove. Well,it didn't work. The President won without Florida (Floridah) The big money got the rug pulled out from under them. Lies,Lies,and Lies cost them the election. The worse was Lying to "Ohio voters" Motor city can tell a flim flam man 5 miles away. The smiling salesman, you know when his mouth moves he's lying.
Notice how once again,the majority of the Red counties are in rural areas of Florida. Along the metropolitan Gold Coast, solid Blue. The only major city that went Red was Jacksonville, but that's almost in Georgia. It would seem that the Romney misinformation campaign worked in the rural areas. Smarter city dwellers weren't fooled.
If you pull up a map of where people on food stamps live, it's all the Republican counties. Yeah, they hate people depending on the government, except for themselves.
That's actually a national trend. Even in blood red Texas the urban areas of Dallas and Houston are predominantly blue.
I live in Minnesota, where the red and blue are reversed. most of rural minnesota is Republican, except the poorest northern counties, who are all on government assistance. It's the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro that drives the consistently democratic presidential electoral votes.
Oh my God, what a bunch of BS you idiots are posting. The crazy thing is, your fellow liberals on here are too stupid to even realize it. The heavily populated areas in Florida went for Obama because they are full of blacks, Hispanics, and retired Jews from New York. @DaveHarris, you are particularly stupid if you think the red counties are the ones that rely on government assistance more than the ghettos in the very blue Dade county.
I'm so happy you are enjoying this. When those people knock on your door you can serve them "Watermellon".
I might point out that the blue areas on the Florida map is where the colleges and universities are located. Young students went for Obama as well as women. Hum, does that mean that the highly educated are liberal and tend to vote Democrat or does it mean that whiny old white men won't vote for a black man? Just saying.
After all it was the Republicans that wanted to raise the interest on student loans and deny women of their rights.
it's so hard for me to believe that after almost fifty years since the civil rights movement, people are still making these racist comments, still afraid of the dark and still making comments about water melon. The racist hates that Obama is president because it reminds them that the majority of America is no longer racist. But so many lag behind. if it where up to me, id give republicans half the country and build a wall across america. let all the repubs move south, and all the dems move north. then peace at last.
Well, the haters are really saying, "I'm not much, but at least I'm not_______________. You can fill in the blank with black, gay, fat, hispanic, short, a llibertard, et al. They still are "not much". but they get comfort a putting down others. That's is all these poor people will ever have in their lives since they will never accomplish or have anything. They need our pity.
Similar in TX, Checkered Demon.
Austin, San Antonio, El Paso, most of Houston and Dallas (and most counties bordering Mexico) are blue here. Yet famers and ranches have seen more aide and benefits under the current administration, including benefits for having wind turbines on their land. Guess those with the oil rigs (also all over rural Tx) won out this time instead though.
It's a good thing the country wasn't depending on Florida to decide this. After our Medicare-defrauding governor tried to make it as hard for people to vote as possible, and wasted lots of their time, they still voted for Obama. Big surprise. He'll be surprised in 2014 when he loses his re-election.
"Governor" Rick Scott -- and I use the term "governor" very loosely here -- shouldn't even bother running for re-election. He and the Republicans around here are more of a realistic threat to democracy than even the Soviets were in their heyday.
Rick Scott got a get out of jail free card. He should be in jail for Medicaid fraud. A tight rope walk with lawyers and judges got him off,but he is still as croaked as a tree branch. Tried to stack the State Supreme Court judges by having them removed for nothing . Smart voters stopped it. He's more dangerous than Allen West,the US congress mental moron. Last we heard,he was asking for a recount. I was hoping the Army would put him under the jail. "He can't handle the truth" Please take away his Colt 1911 ,45cal.
.
Rick Scott is avoiding prosecution by archaic rules of privilege afforded the Governorship. Here in Florida he cannot even be recalled.
2014, when he is voted out, it's not too late to put him in prison where he belongs.
The only revenge is to vote in Democrat's. That will toast him up.
I still don't understand why Florida voted for a proven Republican crook while accusing Democrats of being crooked. Rick Scott's company had to pay money back for Medicare fraud yet the people of Florida voted for him unless that election was stolen too.
Two words: Katherine Harris.
Rick Scott was basically a Tea Party candidate back when the TP was feeling high and mighty. How his supporters could overlook his company's Medicare fraud is an absolute mystery to me. I can hardly wait until 2014 to vote him out and get a decent governor in office. I would take Jeb Bush back--Scott is that bad!
McManus, you are completely wrong. FYI, the day of the election it was teacher's planning day, therefore there were no classes on Miami Dade county schools.
What do you think, that the people of Florida and the rest of the nation are idiots who will believe the pathetic lies the officials are offering? All stupid excuses. They had plenty of time, after all we had an election in August to change Mayor in MDC... also, they could have simply check with the registered voters in advance what was their language preference (for those who don't know, in MDC is mandatory to post signs in English/Spanish/Creole), and adjust the software that printed the ballot to print only on the language of preference, thus reducing the time to read the draconian ballot they gave the citizens of MDC.
I wish the officials had the decency of taking responsibility for their errors instead of blaming on someone else. Lack of planning, or done on purpose to hinder the voter's ability to cast their ballot? I voted early, and on the Department of Elections headquarters there were only 2 computers and one printer.
Do you expect Poll worker and the dept of elections in MDC have any
thought process! Logic wasn't on the test.
Yes. This was done by one party like in Ohio where officials were fired for allowing better practices and not trying to starve the vote! Politics should not be involved in the voting process period. No other major democratic country allows parties to choose election officials!!!!! We need to do the same including redistricting!
Banana Republic, Republicans running the ship.
Chavez is laughing himself sick. He offered Karl Rove his wizbag of tricks but it didn't work here. He forgot to say"Give them gas at 30 cents a gal like I do"
Karl only snickered.
So simpleton your for gerrymandering that;s the only way you Republicans can win elections. Just like you did with winning the House that's the ONLY way you guys can win!
Our election procedures need a full blown overhaul. The system was fine in 1800's but now with all the resources we have and all the voters the overhaul is no only necessary it is critical ---
It should be like a national lottery. They get results within minutes.
how about, all Americans get a lottery ticket, they pick the numbers, and who ever wins becomes the president. same with other offices. then no more party politics. lol
And campaign funding: How about that anyone can donate to "campaign funding", but it all goes into one big pot, then gets taxed so that 50% of it goes to help pay off the national debt, then the remainder gets split down the middle and handed to each candidate and that's what they've got to operate on, period. If someone then wants to donate ads, cars, etc. directly, they too would have to pay 50% of the value in tax towards the deficit.
Just a thought.
Said Secretary of State Ken "How-Can-We-Marginalize-You" Detzner: ... ."
Here's an idea, Ken: Stop whining about the job you announced to Floridians you wanted and would be competent at [which, arguably, you are incompetent at], and do something we generally call WORK.
The story needs to get its facts straight. Florida changed early voting from 14 calendar days prior to the election to 10 calendar days prior. This meant a reduction from 10 voting days to 8 voting days--not from 14 to 8 as stated by the story. This was the third election this year that this has occurred--the Jan Presidential Primary, the Aug Primary, and then the Nov General election. Why this has mystified and challenged any voter, I can't say. But it has been well publicized all year.
I heard that next election they are going to have more days to vote, more polling places, and much better voting machines, the only problem is only republicans will be on the ballot, what's up with that!!!
The Presidential Primary was only a Republican election - not a Democratic or Independent election - thus only 35% were impacted
Oscar you also forgot that they made the ballot 11 pages long. all of which has to be sent by fax when yo vote it took an average of 30 minutes to cast a single vote. Now why would make the ballot 11 pages long instead of using a condensed version like every state with a Democrat for a Govener in the country
It is exactly what the republicans did, slow the process down, make it difficult, less days to vots, less places to vote, all to keep people (democrats) from voting. Well that sure did bite them in the a$$ because now Florida didn't even count in the election and Romney lost Florida when eventually it does finish its counting process. A relative told me of no parking where they voted and police issuing tickets to voters parking on the street outside polling place. This was in Miami Dade county.
This was true about parking. Many dropped people off and called by cell to pick them up. 5 hrs later,still waiting. The people read the whole ballot. They had sample ballots they could have done at home. Well it's Floridah,right!
How can it be more difficult for dems than for rep? Seems everyone votes in the same place.
I bet the people in Palm Springs don't vote in the same place as the people in Miami. Get a clue!
I would think that any Republican that had to wait in line for 9 hours would have decided to vote Democrat by the time they got their ballot....
That's funny. But in my heavily Republican small town, there was no wait at all. No lines! I could have been out of there in five minutes if I hadn't had to do a provisional ballot (comment #1.18).
That would seem to be the whole point. In Republican counties, access was much easier than in Democratic ones. Thanks for illustrating this so well.
THANK GOD Florida didn't decide the vote in this election.
Al Gore wasn't so lucky. If he were President all this debt could have been diverted. We would not have lost all those GI's and Karl Rove would have gone to jail.
Amen Brother JB Amen!
And the Bushwacher would have been in some long deserted ranch in T-E-X-A-S!
I would think that any Republican that had waited in line for nine hours would have changed his/her vote to Democrat by the time they got the ballot...
We need national, non partisan supervision of elections with a mandate to ensure equal access and smooth running-that means early voting, easy registration, same day registration, etc. We need laws that prevent last minute voter purges, and ID laws. No state should be allowed to impose any new regulations until they can prove they have provided the necessary ID to all registered voters.
I would be happy to see a non partisan group like The League of Women Voters funded and tasked to oversee our elections.
Some would see this done by govt, but you can't keep the politics out of it-the GOP would absolutely try to take advantage of any opportunity to keep voters out of the voting booth.
Our voting situation is a national scandal-about the worst we have. This has been going on for years-we have been embarassed in election after election, and still, nothing is done.
Congress does have the power to place regulations on Congressional voting. If that's not enough, then we need a Constitutional Ammendment to protect our voting rights.
We are not free if we cannot vote. No one should have to stand in line all day to exercise this right. No eligible voter should be refused the right to vote because they don't have the right ID.
One solution is to issue a national ID, but we have never been a papers please country.
No party should be allowed to game the system to deprive voters of their rights.
What we really need is honest politicians (maybe an oxymoron). Here in Washington State, a Republican presided honorably and fairly over the election process for many years. Of course, the national Republican Party repudiated him because he refused to be corrupted by the party.
Romney won the Confederacy, what's up with that!!!
Google LBJ and the voting rights act. He predicted that his signing of the act would lose the South for the Democratic Party for at least our lifetime.
So far, he has been proven 100% right.
Voting can be a simple process if that is the desired outcome. In Florida they could extend early voting and absentee voting which would give them plenty of time to reconcile signatures. Of course the operative word is desire a simple process!!
The Republican Legislature tried to supress the vote by reducing early voting by half and adding idiotic ballot initiatives; clearly voters got upset by the attempt and went to the polls in greater numbers. Stop Tampering with Voters Rights
Why Florida still uses paper ballots and voting machines that have to be alignned properly with the vote cards is far beyond me.
My county has 11or 12 thousand people in it and we can afford electronic voting machines with a paper backup. If there are screwups I'm not aware of any. In fact, I don't think anywhere in my state has the idiocy to use paper ballots. Even absentee voting, unless done by mail, is on an electronic voting maching.
Get with it Florida.
As for Jacksonville going red, it's probably my idiot brother that cost the Democrats as his was probably the last vote counted.
Screw electronic voting machines. I know you said "with a paper back-up", but that just emphasizes the point that electronic voting machines can be hacked. You don't think Florida would do that?
I've said it before.
We need to implement secure electronic voting via the internet.
While it may seem remarkable to you and me, not everyone has access to the Internet. Yet.
@ Steve,
There is no such thing as secure Internet. Electronic voting with paper print out is the best thing, that way there will always be a hard copy of all votes.
We use paper ballots, a pencil and an optical scanner here in California. The dumber the system the better.
As a recently retired IT security specialist, I would really like to see how you would be able to "securely" vote over the internet. If you can, then you'd be worth millions to many companies. My guess is you're just naive.
"Secure" and "via the internet" don't belong in the same sentence, please.
It would have to be a combination of sources. US Mail. Biometrics (@MDV?). With modern technology, it can be achieved.
How many of you do online banking and are comfortable enough given that level of security? It's only your life savings, after all. Should be part of a national ID system. If you expect people who "look like illegals" to instantly provide proof of citizenship, is there a better way? It's inevitable that it will happen.
3thirty3 IT security I left to the pros as a valuable resource in my means to an end as an embedded control engineer. Like I said above, the inet would have to be just a component.
We need to enfranchise ALL Americans. EVERYBODY needs to vote.
These people act as though this state, Florida, is the only state in the entire country to have the problems of locations, absentee ballots, early voting etc, etc... After the ridiculous travesty of 2000, a true joke in voting history, you would think they could have gone on a field trip to one of the other 49 states that actually got it right!! I can't believe that the state organization (?!) or the federal system would allow this to continue! The rest of the country looks on with disdain and incredulity - its 2012, you haven't had a chance to get it right yet???
This is what happens in a Banana Republic governed by a known crook voted in office by a gullible electorate who, were it not for Miami, Palm, Broward and Orange counties, could easily pass for a bunch of ignorant geechees. When they had a chance at better options these dumba$$es chose Scott and nincompoops like Alan West. Don't expect improvement in future election cycles. Stupidity tends toward a longer half-life in tropical climates!
To be fair to the people of Florida, Governor Rick Scott (the man whom you are referencing as "a known crook") does have an approval rating that is forever hoving in the low 40's or upper 30's. So it's not like Floridians are completely clueless.
But he got voted in anyway!
My fellow Floridians also elected that do-nothing idiot token-"hispanic" Marco Rubio.
f--- this state

Jason Kipnis went 3-for-4 with a three-run homer, a walk and three runs scored in the Indians' 10-4 drubbing of the Phillies on Wednesday.
Kipnis has six homers since April 29 after going without one in his first 15 games. He's hitting .288 with 15 runs scored and 17 RBI in his last 16 games.
Corey Kluber surrendered three runs in six innings Wednesday in a victory over the Phillies.
So, it turns out that Kluber is pretty good when he doesn't walk anyone or allow homers. He's put up zeroes in both categories in both of his wins this year, but he's walked six and allowed three homers in his two losses. Of course, this is true of every pitcher. Kluber just has less margin for error than most.
Michael Bourn is not in Wednesday's lineup against the Phillies.
The hot-hitting Michael Brantley is also getting the day off. Drew Stubbs is starting in center field while Ryan Raburn plays left.
Scott Kazmir was knocked around for four runs on six hits and two walks over five innings in Tuesday's loss to the Phillies.
Kevin Frandsen took Kazmir deep in the first inning, and Domonic Brown provided the knockout blow with a longball to lead off the sixth. The lefty hit a pair of batters and threw 96 pitches in the five-plus innings. The outing takes a little helium out of the Kazmir balloon, but he was still sitting comfortably around 93-94 mph and remains intriguing in fantasy leagues. He'll try to bounce back next week against the Mariners.
Indians manager Terry Francona said Mark Reynolds "will get the majority of the time at third" base following the demotion of Lonnie Chisenhall.
Reynolds is making his third straight start at the position Tuesday since Chisenhall's demotion. He offers below average defense at the hot corner, but with the way he's swinging the bat, the Indians don't really care. Having Reynolds at third should ultimately mostly help Ryan Raburn and Jason Giambi get more playing time. Mike Aviles will also see some starts at the hot corner
Brett Myers (elbow) threw around 45 pitches Tuesday in a bullpen session at Citizens Bank Park.
Myers could be cleared to make a rehab start this weekend if he wakes up Wednesday with no abnormal discomfort. The right-hander has been on the disabled list since April 21 with a mild tear of the UCL in his elbow. The Indians could ask him to make multiple rehab starts..

Denny Hamlin led the first Happy Hour practice for the Sprint Unlimited at Daytona International Speedway.
His lap of 196.053 mph in the No. 11 Toyota was the quickest of the 12 cars out on the track for this session. No. 22 Joey Logano, No. 16 Greg Biffle, No. 29 Kevin Harvick and No. 43 Aric Almirola were the rest of the top 5 on the speed chart. Jimmie Johnson (No. 48) was the slowest. Hamlin also had the best 10 lap average speed (194.500 mph) of the five cars that ran at least 10 consecutive laps in this final Sprint Unlimited practice.

Rural jobless numbers climb back to 10 percent
After an April in which North Carolina's rural jobless numbers finally clicked below 10 percent, May's unemployment rate crept back into the double digits.
According to the N.C. Employment Security Commission, 219,721 people in the 85 rural counties were unemployed in May. Roughly the same number were unemployed in urban counties, but the percentage of unemployed rural people was higher: 10 percent vs. 8.9 percent.
In April, rural unemployment was measured at 9.8 percent, the first time it had been below 10 percent since December 2008. Statewide unemployment in May increased slightly to 9.4 percent.
The federal government sees no immediate economic light at the end of this years-long tunnel. In a recent report from the Federal Reserve, regulators reported tepid retail sales, mixed manufacturing numbers and a modest growth in lending throughout our region, which includes the Carolinas and Virginia.
In one of the report's lone bright spots, several Outer Banks hotel owners reported strong late spring sales and improved summer reservations in comparison with last year.
Even as the overall trends are beginning to improve — North Carolina's rural employment grew by 28,440 in the first five months of 2012 — there are still 47 rural counties still have unemployment rates of more than 10 percent and 12 with unemployment over 12 percent.
“It has been a long road to recovery in rural North Carolina,” said Anne Bacon, the Rural Center's senior director for workforce development. “Certain counties and certain groups – including young people, minorities, veterans and laid-off workers with outdated skills – have experienced especially high unemployment levels."

The congregation was organized in 1879, eight years after the
first homestead
claim was filed in Howard County. The first church at this location, a frame structure
dedicated in 1881, was destroyed by fire in February 1905. Construction of this
building, the oldest church in town still at its original site, began in September 1905 and
was completed in July 1907 at a cost of $15,000, including the furniture and organ. The
bell now in use survived the 1905 fire.

If you could ask the Fourth Congressional District candidates one question, what would it be?
Democrat Joe Kennedy III and Republican Sean Bielat will join Patch this week for two separate live text chats with readers.
Bielat will be taking questions in a live chat on Needham Patch on Thursday, Oct. 11 at noon, and Kennedy will be chatting with voters via Patch on Friday, Oct. 12 at 1 p.m.
Now is your chance to ask these potential Congressmen what they think about health care reform, job creation, military spending and more.
The live chats will run for 45 minutes to an hour. To submit a question, come back to Needham Patch on Oct. 11 at noon and Oct. 12 at 1 p.m., click on the live chat, enter your name, and you will be able to ask your questions immediately.
If you can't make the live chats, leave your questions in the comments section below this article, and we'll do our best to add them to the questions queue. We will publish the live chat transcript immediately and a recap first thing Friday morning.
Questions submitted will be subject to moderator approval. No vulgar or libelous comments will be allowed. Because we expect a high volume of questions for the chat session, we will keep the questions issue-related and not repetitive.

Last week, we had some fairly large disruptions to the financial systems of America and the global economy. With the major events of Europe surrounding the debt crisis of Greece, the ramifications were felt around the world (welcome to the global integrated economy). The result was on Thursday a major drop in the stock markets including a one-thousand point drop in a matter of minutes on the Dow. While the markets recovered slightly, this is hardly a sign of stability.
The event is an important one even as the media and financial “experts” downplay its significance. The reality is that the markets are a house of cards. In fact, the entire global economy is a house of cards. We have seen hard evidence of this in recent years with the financial crash in 2008 and events like a 1,000 point Dow move just last week. While these events are papered over with freshly printed currency and government bailouts, the structural issues remain underneath the surface.
As such, I’m losing faith in the “systems” that we rely on. Specifically, I’m losing faith in the financial systems and even the stock market. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs announces that they did not have a single day of trading losses in the last 63 days. Yes, 63 out of 63 profitable trading days last quarter. Can you say, “rigged’?
If and when the system comes crashing down as many of us predict, an entire generation of Americans will be crushed. Over the last 30+ years, Americans have become way too connected to the financial markets. Wall St. and their partners in Washington D.C. have convinced a generation of Americans that the only way to have any sort of retirement or financial security is to be invested fully at all times in the U.S. stock market. While Americans see their savings and funds go up and down with volatility, there is always a consistent winner: Wall St and their constant fees that are generated regardless of performance.
The dependence on the stock market is one of many dependencies that have been cemented over the recent decades. Dependence on government, welfare, corporate America, pensions, stocks, etc. have together replaced self-reliance and self directed financial security.
If the system collapses under its own weight, the result will be ugly. Not only will people’s savings be wiped out, but they will demand answers or demand someone’s head. I’d hate to be a wealthy Wall St. exec at this point in time.
It’s important to take action now. Don’t be fully invested in the stock market. Have some of your wealth in real assets: precious metals, consumer products, other things that have real value. I’m not saying you should abandon all paper assets, but understand the volatility (just look at last Thursday’s Dow chart).
In the meantime, if you want to stay invested in stocks to some extent, I’d say you can afford to be patient before you buy more stocks. Wait for the next crash. Then, deploy your funds into well-run, well-established companies that pay a nice dividend. Think stocks like Philip Morris Int’l (PM), Wal-Mart (WMT), McDonalds (MCD). Then continue to collect dividends, pool your cash, and wait for the next crash. Rinse. Repeat.
Good luck and don’t trust the markets to act like pure markets. They are manipulated and corrupt. Be extremely careful with any trading or investing you do, and make sure you do your own research before acting upon anything mentioned here.

VERY wise, indeed. Your guardian angel must be whispering in your ear. No, really, I’m serious. Do you realize how many people out there are still blindly listening to their fiancial manager that tell you things like “you can’t time the market”. Yeah, thats the same guy I told, only July 7th to get all of my money out into guaranteed accounts. He talked me out of it saying that risk is better because I’d make more money. Well, now, I’m about $40,000 down and he’s on my sh*t list! Of course, he lost his fanny too, so, now, when I told him about the second crash thats coming (seems I was about 6 months early), he’s already pulled his stuff. I guess hindsight is 20/20, huh? Of course I’m pretty well diversified but my real investment is the food, fuel and firearms plus a little silver.
When the blades start slinging the rest will be singing the blues.

I have on order a Leisure Line 220K boiler for my home. I've been doing lots of reading on this site for how other people hook up their boilers. I am certainly not a plumbing expert by any means, but I have some thougts and observations.
I understand there are various multi-boiler designs. For the most part, people are going with Series, Parallel, and Primary Secondary loop designs (people are mistakenly calling this parallel) when integrating dual boilers in their homes. Series makes sense for keeping both boilers warm, but it may have some inefficiencies as far as a second boiler being warm all the time. It also provides a single point of failure. Parallel seems to be the most efficient, in my opinion, however you could potentially introduce leaks or corrosion as you have a cold boiler. Primary Secondary is a neat, high tech design, however I think it is overkill and inefficient for a home design. Especially if you have multiple 80 Watt circulators running when you only need one in a residential heating system. I'm also thinking in terms of being able to run your system on UPS or generator when you have no power. If you have a call for heat on 4 zones, 5 circulators running, that's 400 watts of power. It also has a cold boiler. These are my observations, and I welcome anyone to counter my thoughts.
I currently have 8 zones in my house. One zone is for a Boiler Mate, one zone (although it is deactive) is for the basement, three zones for the first floor, two zones for the second, and one zone in the attic. The house is 3300 SQ Feet. There is already a recent Burham oil burner in the house and I want to add a Lesuire Line 220K as a second boiler.
My plan is to go with a Hybrid Series design that I came up with. It is a series design which will use the LL 220K to warm the Oil Boiler, however it will utilize 4 3-way valves to allow me to isolate each boiler. It will have a single circulator that sits on the return side. Expansion tank and air purge will sit on the supply side. Please see the below drafts I came up with on my current and dual boiler design.
Current Design
Proposed Design
Obviously these designs are missing some valves and I missed the expansion tank.. I would consider a parallel system, but is it a real concern about a cold boiler leaking (mine doesn't today when it is cold) and is there any damage that could occur to the boiler in terms of corrosion from it sitting for years full of water but cold? Does anyone have any thoughts or comments?

Help:Enhanced recent changes
The preferences can be set to use the Enhanced Recent Changes feature (not for all browsers) instead of the classical Recent Changes. It groups recent changes per day, where "day" is defined according to local time. For each day, it groups the changes by article, and displays the titles of the changed articles in order from new to old latest change of the day concerned, or in the case of hiding minor edits, latest major change.
Multiple edits on the same day to a single article are grouped together on the Recent Changes screen. Only a summary line is shown, info about the individual edits is loaded into the browser right away but only shown by clicking on the blue arrow on the left. This option uses JavaScript, and won't work in every browser (see Browser issues with MediaWiki).
This feature applies also to Related changes and the enhanced watchlist. The latter is simply a selection of the enhanced recent changes, namely a restriction to watched pages, without the bolding.
Composition of lines
(For the pages Wikipedia:Upload log, the corresponding pages on Wiktionary and Wikibooks, and perhaps a few more pages some links are not present).
Pages for which there is only one edit
The line shows:
Nm ! time pagename (diff; hist) . . (size_change) . . username (Talk | contribs | block) edit_summary
- possibly "N" for new page
- possibly "m" for minor edit
- possibly "!" for edit patrol
- time (the date is not shown here, it is in a header)
- page name linked to the current version
- the link diff to this edit
- the link hist to the page history
- change in the size of the wikitext in bytes
- user, linked to his or her user page
- Talk, linking to the user talk page
- contribs, linking to the user contributions page
- if the page is loaded by a sysop: block
- edit summary
Pages for which there are multiple edits
The top line, which is the only one shown before clicking on the arrow, shows:
> time pagename (number_of_changes changes)..(size_change)..(Page history) [username (number_of_editsx)];..]
- time
- page name linked to the current version
- number of edits during the day concerned (if it is the oldest day covered by this Enhanced Recent Changes page: restricted by the total number of edits covered by this page)
- the link changes to the cumulation of these changes
- change in the size of the wikitext in bytes
- Link Page history
- the users, linked to their user pages, with for each the number of edits
The lines per edit show:
Nm ! time (cur; last) . . (size_change) . . username (Talk | contribs | block) edit_summary
- possibly "N" for new page
- possibly "m" for minor edit
- possibly "!" for edit patrol
- time, linked to the page version created at this time
- the link cur to this edit
- the link last to this edit
- change in the size of the wikitext in bytes
- user, linked to his or her user page
- Talk, linking to the user talk page
- contribs, linking to the user contributions page
- if the page is loaded by a sysop: block
- edit summary
In the case that a page is moved, the data refer to the edits of the page that at the time had the specified name. In the case of edits before the move and edits of the redirect resulting from the move, the figure for the total change in size is not the actual total of the size changes listed, because it also includes the size change due to changing into a redirect because of the move.
Examples:
File:Arr r.png:
File:Arr d.p)
RTL languages
Comparison of enhanced recent changes on an RTL site and on an LTR site (line with an arrow):
- RTL site, LTR interface
- [(x2) changes)..(+36)..(Page history) [username 2) pagename 12:53 <
- RTL site, RTL interface
- [(x2) username] (changes)..(36+)..(2 :Page history) pagename 12:53 <
- LTR site and interface
- > 12:53 pagename (2 changes)..(+36)..(Page history) [username (2x)]
Thus, on the RTL site, in "2 changes", the "2" gets separated from "changes". Also, on an RTL site with LTR interface, in "username (2x)", the "(2x)" gets separated from "username", and the bracket structure seems broken.

At least 30% of people in the Americas suffer from hypertension, or high blood pressure, for which excessive dietary salt is the main risk factor. For 1 of 3 people who have hypertension, cutting sodium intake can reduce their blood pressure to normal levels. Reducing dietary salt could also prevent an estimated 25% of heart attacks and strokes worldwide.

healthy or not?
(via headoncollisionnnn-deactivated2)
Little disappointed this morning when I weighed myself and only lost .2 of a pound since Wednesday. Not what I wanted to see after struggling through yesterday and reminding myself that this all is possible and not to give up. I’ve decided to completely devote myself to doing two a day work outs at least 3 times a week for at least the rest of the month. I’ll worry about October once I get there.
Need to lose 18 pounds in 15 days to stay on track for what my goal was this month. Crunch time. I can do this.

Breakfast - two egg whites with onions, 60 calories
Lunch - “Snack Pack” (contained honey pretzels, grapes, cheese, and apple slices), 200(ish) calories
Snack - NONE! :D
Dinner - 1 Pizza Slice, 300 calories

You may or may not know and perhaps care even less, but I've recently tied the knot! It was brillant actually and wholeheartedly recommend it to all of you!!!
So of course it was my stag do a few weeks back and rather than going go-karting or some other nonsense we decided to pay a visit to the chaps at brewdog where Brewdog's Emperor Penguin had invited us to try our hand at brewing. How good was it? FUCKING BRILLIANT! The guys up there are fantastic and incredibly hospitable. It was, despite my somewhat accelerated state of stag do 'refreshment' a really great insight in to what goes on at this now world famous brewery and what makes it utterly special.
It was pretty damn interesting for me to feel the atmosphere of the brewery and to meet the brewers and workers - there's a great collegiate kinda feeling with young brewers from around the world as well as local lads doing what must be one of the hardest and most fun jobs you can do! Brewdog have a great background in collaboration with the likes of Three Floyds and Mikkeler - the gypsy brewer, it's the way it should be and I congratulate James and Martin for fortering this kind of atmostphere.
Frazerburgh is one hell of a place, right on the very edge of Scotland, stuck right out in to the North Sea. It's a place of extremes. Extremes that I discovered whilst camping in the most unsheltered campsite in the UNIVERSE and I didn't feel so fucking clever at 4am in the morning, clutching a bottle of Sink the Bismark while my tent whipped around me in the salty lashing rain, 'you should have pegged it in properly' I hear you say... No that campsite is the devils own work, don't go there in Winter, you'll die.
It makes sense that what's made there is equally extreme and Brewdog have made such an impact on the UK scene, they've ruffled plenty of feathers and in the process have created some beers of true brilliance. Several of which I sampled, regularly, throughout the weekend... In particular we drank a shed load of 5am saint right from the tank.
I was pretty lucky to try a brand new IPA made Bramling cross hops which was bang on. Bramling is a British hop with a distinctly American aroma but a brilliant British fruity taste. The beer is cracking and has a juicy traditional IPA roundness, coupled with a great level of bitterness and a salty bite - this in particular is intriguing and something I've only really noticed in a couple of beers before now. I love it. Is it something to do with brewing with the North Sea literally at your back door? Is it something to do with my tastebuds being fucked after the weekend?
We're just about to put on our creation at North Bar. It's named Alice Porter in honour of my wife (her maiden name) and of course it's a porter! It's 6.2% and smooth as hell, we used alot of the aforementioned Bramling cross as well as a great hop called sorachi. The idea was essentially to brew something pretty stout but use the fruit of the Bramling and the lemony-ness of the sorachi to add that porter tang! It's worked and has produced a highly quaffable beverage along the lines. If you can't get down to North over the next month or so then you may find it at Further North or the Marble Arch in Manchester. A small amount has also been released in London and Aberdeen under the name 'Santa doesn't exist'.
So there you go - ace eh. I must credit the brewers with the creation of the beer - we picked hops and malt and did a load of donkey work, those guys are amazing and I'm looking forward to seeing them at North so I can return the favour... So to speak...
Nice one! The Alice Porter was on at the White Horse last week and it was fantastic - good work!
Niiiiiice....am going to have for lunch tomorrow!
Hey Matt, great post - very amusing.
Congratulations on tying the knot.

June 3, 2012: I was adopted by a great family! Yay me!
June 3, 2012: I was adopted by a great family! Yay me!
Hello everyone, my name is Astrid but my friends call me Aster. I'm a totally adorable 18 month old pup who is looking for a great family to spend my life with!
Come on, throw the toy for me!
There's horses and chickens at my foster home too and I like to quietly sit and watch them and I never bark at them. There was this one time a chicken accidentally wandered into my play yard and I thought it was a toy and I was playing with it. Apparently I'm not supposed to carry chickens around though (who knew?) and as soon as my foster dad told me to drop it, I did. Don't worry, the chicken is ok because I was gentle when I was playing with her. I'm such a good girl!
I like playing with short dogs! Check me out playing with my foster brother before my surgery......
I like playing with tall dogs too! Look at me, what a good girl I am!
I like playing with tall dogs too! Look at me, what a good girl I am!
My vet also said I have very mild (grade 1) dysplasia in my left hip, but that I didn't need to worry about that, so I'm not worrying! It sure doesn't slow me down at all! My right knee was sore and swollen when I arrived in foster care, but it is all healed up and doing great too. Hooray!
Check me out running on the trails at my foster home! I'm such a good girl, I come when I'm called and I am very well behaved! Yay me!
I'm looking for a family who lives in a bungalow, or ranch style home with just a few stairs. Flooring should be non-slip so I don't wipe out and hurt my knee! My foster mom says whoever adopts me needs to be active and like to get out and do fun things. She also says you'll need some time to work on some training and socialization with me. That sounds like fun! I'm probably a little too, ummm, enthusiastic, for a home with toddlers since I can be a bit of a goof sometimes.
Yep, I'm a goof!
I'm being fostered in the Bancroft, ON area and my adoptive family will have to pick me up in person. An adoption donation of $500 applies.

US campus searches for answers to gun violence
By Adam Geller | AP - BOSTON
11th February 2013 12:27 PM
On a Friday afternoon in December, Lee Pelton was driving home with his 13-year-old daughter in the passenger seat when radio reports of the Connecticut and already is home to some of the nation's strictest gun laws.
"I've had some detractors," Pelton said, describing a note he received from a gun owner "taking me to task for using my First Amendment rights to undermine his Second Amendment rights." The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech. The Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear firearms.
But when students returned to the Emerson campus in mid-January following the holiday recess, Pelton's call to discuss arms found supporters.
Gregory Payne assigned students in his classes to talk about gun policy and create public service announcements that would address the issue. Spencer Kimball led Emerson's polling club in taking a scientific survey of U.S. voters' attitudes about gun legislation. Benny Ambush. student, student, student,, talked about how her own family has struggled with mental illness, explaining the challenges of committing someone to an institution for care.
"I think that took a lot of courage," Morlath said. "You could tell she was coming from an emotional place."

William Lloyd Garrison headed the Abolitionist movement to free slaves
Created on Thursday, 07 February 2013 11:13 Last Updated on Thursday, 07 February 2013 11:13 Published on Thursday, 07 February 2013 11:13 Written by Courier Newsroom Hits: 1023
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON
William Lloyd Garrison was born Dec. 10, 1805 and died May 24, 1879. He was the most prominent American abolitionist in the country until Frederick Douglass. He was a journalist, and social reformer. em rejected all who were committed to it.
Garrison began writing for and became co-editor with Benjamin Lundy of the Quaker Genius of Universal Emancipation newspaper in Baltimore, Md. Garrison’s experience as a printer and newspaper editor allowed him to revamp the layout of the paper and freed Lundy to spend more time travelling on Dec. Jan. 1, 1831, to Jan. 1,31, Garrison founded the New-England Anti-Slavery Society. The next year, he co-founded the American Anti-Slavery Society. That same year, 1833, Garrison also visited the United Kingdom and assisted in the anti-slavery movement there. Garrison had a strong influence on the ideas of Susan Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone and other feminists who joined the society. He intended that the Anti-Slavery Society should not align itself with any political party and that women should be allowed full participation in society activities.).
In 1853, Garrison credited Reverend John Rankin of Ohio as a primary influence on his career, calling him his “anti-slavery father” and saying that Rankin's “...book on slavery was the cause of my entering the anti-slavery conflict.”.” On July 4, 1854 he went so far as to publicly burn a copy of the Constitution condemning it as “a Covenant with Death, an Agreement with Hell,” referring to the compromise that had written slavery into the Constitution. [2] His earlier alliance with the famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass disintegrated over their incompatible views regarding the Constitution: Douglass insisted that the document could be interpreted as anti-slavery, whereas Garrison was convinced that slavery had tainted its essence.
Garrison was an important contributor to the suffrage movement.
His outspoken anti-slavery views repeatedly put him in danger. Besides his imprisonment in Baltimore, the government of the State of Georgia offered a reward of $5,000 for his arrest, and he was the object of vituperation and frequent death threats.
After the abolition of slavery in the United States, Garrison continued working on other reform movements, especially temperance and women's suffrage.)

- The total has gone UNDER in 4 of Chi White Sox’s last 6 games
- The total has gone UNDER in 4 of Chi White Sox’s last 6 games on the road
- Chi White Sox are 1-4 SU in their last 5 games on the road

- The total has gone UNDER in 6 of Detroit’s last 9 games when playing Chi White Sox
- Detroit is 11-4 SU in their last 15 games when playing Chi White Sox
- Detroit is 7-1 SU in their last 8 games when playing at home against Chi White Sox
Don’t look now, but after last night’s win the Detroit Tigers are only half a game behind the Chicago White Sox in the AL Central. The White Sox have led almost the entire way in the division, but the Tigers have finally turned it on. Detroit was seen as a major underachiever through the first half of the year. If the Tigers are going to take the lead in the division on Saturday, they’ll have to do it against the White Sox Ace. First place is on the line in Detroit Saturday afternoon!
Chris Sale has been one of baseball’s best pitchers this year. Sale was turned into a starting pitcher during the offseason after being a successful reliever the past couple years. The results have been better than anyone could have expected. Sale is 11-2 with a 2.11 ERA so far this year. There is no doubt that his dominating pitching is one of the main reasons the White Sox have been such a positive surprise so far this season.
Adam Dunn hit a miserable .159 and had only 11 home runs last season. Dunn has 28 homers and 65 RBI’s to lead the team this year. Alex Rios is another guy who has bounced back in a big way from a down year in 2011. A.J. Pierzynski is putting together a great offensive season, and Paul Konerko continues to be the team’s best all-around hitter. The White Sox are averaging 4.68 runs per game this year.
Many people had written off Detroit after a poor first half of the season, but the Tigers have come roaring back of late. Detroit has won 8 of their last 10 games to close to within half a game of the division lead. Miguel Cabrera has been good all season, but he has been smashing the ball of late. Cabrera is hitting .328 with 21 homers and 77 RBI’s. Those 77 RBI’s are second in the majors behind only Josh Hamilton. Prince Fielder isn’t far behind with 68 RBI’s. Fielder was a huge offseason acquisition, and Tigers fans have to be happy with his play this year. Austin Jackson is a major spark for this offense from the leadoff spot. The Tigers have the fourth best batting average in baseball at .269.
The Tigers have struggled to find good starting pitching this year other than Justin Verlander. One of the main reasons the team is on a winning streak right now is that they have gotten some clutch performances from third and fourth starters in the rotation. Rick Porcello has been inconsistent all season, but he’ll need to be good to give them a chance here.
MLB Free Pick: Under 8.5
Sale has been shutting teams down all season, and Porcello has decent numbers against the White Sox in his career. Look for this one to turn into a tight

Earlier, unofficial reports had spoken of five casualties.
President Hu Jintao expressed deep condolences over the loss of lives, Xinhua said. He has ordered an investigation into the crash.
The accident happened in the province of Anhui, some 200km (125 miles) south-west of Shanghai.
An unnamed official at the Anhui provincial government office told the Associated Press news agency that the accident had happened at about 1600 (0800 GMT) on Saturday near the village of Yaocun, in Guangde county.
Villagers rushed to the scene after hearing an explosion, a local man told AP by telephone.
The plane's body hit bamboo forest and its tail fell in fields, the man said.
The witness, named only as Tang, said he had seen two bodies before the area was cordoned off.
Details of the type of plane and its flight path have not been given.

The UK National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre's (NISCC) report into Trojan horses in e-mails says they are getting increasingly sophisticated.
Organised gangs are using distribution e-mail lists to cleverly engineer mails that look legitimate and relevant.
The Home Office said many of the attacks seemed to originate from Asia.
Structured and organised.
"We have not seen anything like this in terms of the scale of industrial attacks before," a Home Office spokesperson told the BBC News website.
NISCC is in constant contact with the CNI about net threats, but the aim of this report and the protection advice issued on its website, is to ensure others that fall outside the usual CNI channels of communication get the message.
This would include any organisations that work with commercially sensitive information.
"The reason why we have chosen to go public this way is because we have gone through the usual routes - we have flagged up the threats to the CNI stakeholders.
"But because of the scale and organised nature of these attacks, we have felt the need to scale up the footprint of this alert," he said.
The spokesperson added that NISCC had "no evidence" that any sensitive information had actually been stolen via any attacks, and that the origin of attacks was difficult to pin down.
Based on internet protocol address (IP) evidence, though, they tended "overwhelming" to originate from the Far East.
The number of organisations targeted was also not known, but the fresh advice was aimed at increasing awareness, said the spokesperson.
Alert and aware
Trojan horses are small, malicious programs usually hidden in e-mail attachments. They can also be picked up on certain websites.
They can perform a number of functions once they are launched unwittingly, such as secretly install keylogging programs which can then be used to gather sensitive passwords and other information.
Net security firm."
Increasingly, people are fooled into opening the e-mails because many have a subject line which makes them look like normal correspondence.
The e-mails also often appear to come from people known to the recipient. This kind of "social engineering" is a newer aspect to net threats which cybercriminals are using.
The continued use of e-mail distribution lists to discuss certain topics within businesses and government departments meant specific information and e-mail addresses could be gleaned from the net quite easily, said Richard Veale, director of the specialist information risk management firm, Ebis.
This way, cybercriminals could tailor e-mails to look like a relevant discussion topic to the recipient.
"Some very sophisticated individuals are leveraging the inadequacy in government and corporate security around information flows," he told the BBC News website.
This meant there was a "phenomenal amount" of "uncontrolled information", he said.
"Organisations and government departments are not in control of the information process as much as they thought. It is like leaving a window ajar."
He said quantification of the scale of the threat appeared to be almost impossible and that many businesses may even be unaware they have been hit by a Trojan.
Up to you
Recent reports from anti-virus firms suggest that hackers are getting more sophisticated and can make viruses and other harmful software mutate so quickly that anti-virus software has difficulty keeping up.
The UK's NISCC and National Hi-Tech Crime Unit are working with the authorities in a number of Asian countries to identify and shut down the internet addresses the attacks are coming from.
"There is a limit to what government resources can do and it is up to companies and organisations to take responsibility themselves," said the Home Office spokesperson.
"It is clearly important for companies to always be aware that there are vulnerabilities and threats out there."

Mashable just reported on a major upgrade from Facebook. The social network would be rolling out an upgrade to its mobile interface bringing unification by rolling out a single interface across all mobile websites. Currently, Facebook offers two types of mobile websites, one being the touch.facebook.com, which is designed to cater high-end smartphones with touchscreens, and m.facebook.com, which is best suited for feature phone.
According to the social network, the company is facing hurdles in maintaining multiple platforms which results to a major problem when it comes to developing new features.
Facebook would be unifying its mobile presence on m.facebook.com, starting today. An official announcement by Facebook’s Lee Byron, read:
There will no longer be a difference between m.facebook.com and touch.facebook.com. We’ll automatically serve you the best version of the site for your device.
With the growing number of users glued to Facebook mobile, the company had to sort out things in order to maintain the rhythm of rolling out new features. The change would provide a consistent user interface across various mobile devices.

Flaw in encryption armor discovered
An underlying defect in the OpenSSH encryption protocol has been revealed by academics from Royal Holloway, University of London.
Correction at 5:50 a.m. PDT May 20: The spelling of Kenny Paterson's last name has been corrected.
An underlying flaw in the widely used encryption protocol Open Secure Shell (OpenSSH) has been made public by researchers from the Royal Holloway, University of London.
The flaw, which lies in version 4.7 of OpenSSH on Debian/GNU Linux, allows 32 bits of encrypted text to be rendered in plaintext, according to a research team from the Royal Holloway Information Security Group (ISG).
An attacker has a one in 262,144 chance of success. ISG lead professor Kenny Paterson told CNET News sister site ZDNet UK last Monday that the flaw is more significant than in OpenSSH.
"This is a design flaw in OpenSSH," said Paterson. "The other vulnerabilities have been more about coding errors.".
This vulnerability was first made public in November 2008 by the UK Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), though full details of the flaw were not then given. According to the CPNI advisory, the OpenSSH flaw could be mitigated by IT professionals using AES (advanced encryption standard) in counter mode (CTR) to encrypt, instead of cipher-block chaining mode (CBC).
Paterson said his group had worked with OpenSSH developers to mitigate the flaw, and that OpenSSH version 5.2 contained countermeasures.
"They've fixed (OpenSSH); they've put countermeasures in place to stop our attack," said Paterson. "But the standard has not changed."
Patersonerson added that it always takes time for system administrators to apply patches to servers and clients, no matter whether the software is open source or proprietary.
Tom Espiner of ZDNet UK reported from London.

Canon's top-end consumer HD camcorder improves stability
For another $200, Canon adds another 32GB and possibly improved image stabilization to its top-end Vixia AVCHD camcorder.

If you've a yen to pay $1,399.99 for an HD camcorder, Canon now gives you an option. It extends its HF S10/S100 line upward to the HF S11, which adds another 32GB memory, bringing the total to 64GB for the top-of-the-consumer-line. Plus it follows Sony's example, adding an enhanced version of its SuperRange optical image stabilizer, dubbed Dynamic SuperRange OIS, which compensates better while walking and at wide angles. Canon has also boosted its Video Snapshot mode; it's now Advanced, which seems to mean you can pull 4-second clips in playback mode, as well as in capture mode..

There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which manifests itself as a haemorrhagic fever, is highly infectious and kills quickly. An outbreak in Uganda in 2000 killed 224 people.
The disease was first reported in 1976 in Congo and is named after the river where it was recognised, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists do not know the natural reservoir of the virus, but they suspect the first victim in an outbreak becomes infected through contact with an infected animal.

Higgins to for go half of leader's allowance
on 22/10/2012 00:00:00
Mr Higgins told the Irish Examiner that the decision to waive the legal entitlement to half the allowance had to be viewed alongside the massive funding still being drawn down by the main political parties.
"They are still getting massive amounts from the exchequer," he said.
The allowance was first introduced in 1938. It was only given to party leaders initially and was also based on the number of sitting TDs each party had. The payment was extended to individual Independents in 2001.
Mr Higgins said he had written to the Department of Finance saying that he would waive a claim to €71,520 of the allowance per annum. This would apply from, and include, December.
The decision would lead to pay cuts for his staff and fewer resources for the party, he added.
The full amount payable to the party on an annual basis from the election of two Socialist Party TDs is €143,040, he said.
The advice received from the department is that the full amount could still be claimed by Mr Higgins, even though Ms Daly has left the party.
It says that "the entitlement is calculated on the basis of the number of members elected as members of the 31 Dail, i.e. two members. The annual amount of the allowance payable is therefor €143,040.
"Any change to the status of the elected membership of the party does not alter the existing legal entitlement to the allowance, although some or all of the allowance can be waived."
Ms Daly said last month she had resigned from the party because she wanted to concentrate on building up the United Left Alliance in the Dáil. But Mr Higgins later said the Socialist Party was campaigning on justice in taxation and it was impossible for Ms Daly, as a member of it, to continue to offer support to TD Mick Wallace, who under declared €1.4m in Vat to the Revenue.
Mr Higgins said that he had also chosen to waive the legal entitlement to a party whip's allowance of €6,000 per annum again next year.
"The Socialist Party did not claim a whip's allowance for small parties of €6,000 per year in 2011, nor in 2012, nor will it in the next year," he said. "We do not believe that this is a justifiable expense."
But Mr Higgins called into question the large sums being drawn down by the main parties.
He pointed to the combined party leader's allowance and other funding for parties which were claimed last year and which went to Fine Gael (€4.5m), Labour (€2.6m), Fianna Fáil (€3.3m), and Sinn Féin (€1.5m).

Winter Track Notepad: Cavaliers must fine-tune abundance of raw talent
The Caroline winter track and field team doesn’t have a district to compete in, and the Cavaliers have participated in just two meets this season.
But veteran coach Sansberry Harvey likes what he sees so far.
Caroline’s boys have been particularly pleasing to Harvey. Still, he doesn’t want to get too far ahead of himself.
“Right now we’re still raw,” Harvey said. “So we won’t find out about these guys until next Saturday when we go to the Grand Dragon Relays at the Arthur Ashe Center [in Richmond].”
Junior Aason Pankey has qualified for the Group AA state meet in the 55 meters. The boys 800 relay team of Chris Jackson, Pankey, Daquan Pollard and Mark Rollins also qualified for the state meet at the recent Lafayette Icebreaker.
On the girls side, senior standout Jessica Toliver has achieved state qualifying marks in the long jump and 55 hurdles.
Harvey is also expecting a boost from freshman middle distance runner Cassandra Cooper. Cooper is expected to play softball during the spring outdoor season, but she may help out the Cavaliers track team then, too.
“We try not to push the freshmen too hard,” Harvey said. “She’ll make her own decision where to go. But she’s a real competitive kid.”
Caroline’s boys have their core back from the team that won the Battlefield District outdoor title last May. Pollard, Pankey and Bevontae Morris are capable of helping out in a host of different running and field events.
Morris, who also plays basketball for the Cavaliers, is dealing with an ankle injury.
Harvey also anticipates an impact from transfer Deon Ware, who was a hurdler for Spotsylvania last season. Jackson has showed promise in the field events as a freshman, and two distance runners have also stepped up for the Cavaliers.
Junior Aaron Carter was an all-Region I cross country performer this past season, but he has already been defeated by teammate Michael Williams in the 1,600. The duo provides balance for the Cavaliers, along with junior Freddie Romero–Baker, who earned all-state honors in the pole vault last spring.

Ministry justifies hikes in trainee nurses, midwives' fees
The Ghana Nurse and Midwife Trainees Association and some students of the Mampong Nurse Training College are protesting the increment in school fees by the Ministry.
Some students of the Mampong Nurse Training College, who spoke to Joynews, insisted the new fees be reviewed.
“At first, we were paying GHS400 but now we are paying GHS1500. It’s too much...,” one student lamented.
Another added: “Last (semester) we paid GHS409 for our fees...but this semester we are paying almost GHS1600 and the most annoying thing is about the (hike in the) hostel fee.”
Despite the concerns raised by the students , the Public Relations Officer of the sector ministry, Anthony Goodman has maintained the increments are not as outrageous as being portrayed.
He explained that the increment has resulted due to high cost of living and asked the students to forward their grievances to the ministry.: Ministry justifies hikes in trainee nurses, midwives' fees_2<<

TUESDAY, November 1, 2011 (Health.com) — Feeling isolated and disconnected from the people around you may keep you from getting a good night’s sleep, even if you’re not aware of it, a small new study suggests.
People who feel lonely tend to experience more nighttime restlessness and disruptions than their better-adjusted peers, the study found, which may partly explain why loneliness has been associated with health problems such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression, says lead researcher Lianne Kurina, PhD, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Chicago.
“In lab experiments, when people are intentionally woken up repeatedly, it seems to have effects on [their] metabolism,” she says. “Their insulin sensitivity goes down, almost suggesting that poor sleep could put them at higher risk of type 2 diabetes, for example.”
In the new study, published today in the journal Sleep, the link between loneliness and sleep disruptions persisted even after the researchers took into account marital status and family size. This finding underscores an important distinction between loneliness and social isolation, Kurina says: The amount of loneliness people feel ultimately depends on how they perceive their social situation, not the situation per se.
“There can be people with lots of social connections that feel terribly alone, and conversely there are people with relatively small social networks who do just fine,” Kurina says. “Different people have different needs in terms of relationships—and it’s the space between what you want and what you have that can turn into loneliness.”
The 95 participants in the study all had strong social connections, as they were part of a close-knit, rural community in South Dakota. Yet even small differences in their degrees of loneliness had an impact on their sleep.
Kurina and her colleagues asked the participants how often they felt a lack of companionship, left out, or isolated from others, and they used these responses to rate the men and women on a standard loneliness scale. Then, for one week, the participants wore a wrist device to bed each night that records body movement and sleep disruption (known as an actigraph).
Each one-point increase in the loneliness scale was associated with about an 8% increase in sleep disruptions and restlessness, the researchers found, even when they controlled for age, sex, body mass index, the breathing disorder known as sleep apnea, and negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, and stress.
Loneliness did not appear to influence sleep quality or daytime sleepiness, however, which suggests that the sleep disruptions were minor. More research will be needed to determine if these low-level disruptions can have effects on health similar to those seen in experiments when volunteers are woken up, but it seems plausible that comparable health consequences could occur, Kurina says.
It makes sense that someone who feels alone and vulnerable may wake more easily throughout the night, since early humans may have evolved this tendency to protect against potential threats, the study notes. Even now, Kurina says, short-term feelings of loneliness can be healthy because they can encourage humans to make social connections. Problems can arise, however, if loneliness becomes chronic.
“People who have been very lonely for a while start to expect rejection, to the point where it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Kurina says. For this reason, she adds, it isn’t always helpful to tell someone who feels isolated and insecure to just make friends, get a pet, or go on more dates.
So what’s a lonely heart to do? Begin to rebuild social connections in an emotionally safe way, Kurina suggests. “Engage in situations where you’re not necessarily expecting people to give to you, but where you’re the one giving—like volunteering, or common-interest meetings like book groups,” she says. “Slowly you’ll begin to see the world—and see your relationships—in a more positive way.”

How to Replace Obamacare
A COMMON LIBERAL REFRAIN is that conservatives have no real health care agenda of their own— other than, of course, opposing Obamacare. For instance, in the midst of debate over the president’s signature health “reform” bill, one progressive Florida congressman famously told the House that the GOP’s plan was for sick Americans to “die quickly.”
Baloney. Conservatives could probably stand to put more emphasis on the latter part of “repeal and replace,” but the fact is that many free-market health care reforms enjoy broad consensus on the right.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of Obamacare in late June—after this magazine hits the press. But while the court’s decision could be explosive politically, it will not change the need for conservatives to articulate a strong alternative to state-centered health care. The answer is patient power.
EXPLODING HEALTH CARE COSTS in America stem ultimately from what is known as the thirdparty payment problem—that is to say, the great majority of health costs are not paid by the patients themselves. There is almost always some third party, whether it be an insurance company, an HMO, or the government, footing the bills. Indeed, in 2008, 84 percent of health expenses were paid for by private health insurance or government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP.
Consequently, the consumer has no incentive to control costs. To put it in formal economic terms, the consumer has an incentive to spend until the marginal benefit of additional spending is zero. For instance, if a $1,000 procedure costs you nothing, it’s worth doing—at least in economic terms—for just $1 Of benefit. In an efficient market, consumers spend until the marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost. That $1,000 procedure should only really be worth it for $1,001 of benefit.
In more colloquial terms, the problem is that consumers have an incentive to spend on health care until it hurts, and they have no incentive to shop around. Even worse, doctors and specialists not only have no incentive to control costs, but they actually have a direct financial interest in spending more. Health care providers have no incentive to compete on price, so they compete primarily on quality and secondarily on convenience.
That explains why the American health care system produces far and away the highest quality care in the world: The rewards go to he who creates the best new innovations and most effective new treatments. It also explains why new technology— which drives down costs in every other field—actually increases costs in medicine.
The only solution is to unite the decision over what health care services to purchase with the economic responsibility to pay for them, so costs can be weighed against benefits. And there are only two ways to do that: either the third-party payer (the government or insurance company) is given the power to decide what treatments the patient is allowed to consume, or the patient is given market incentives to consider the full costs of his health care.
Obamacare (and most foreign systems like Britain’s National Health Service) effectively impose the first alternative. With 159 new bureaucracies, boards, agencies, commissions, and programs to govern American health care, plus the individual and employer mandates that require specific health insurance policies, Obamacare could be rightly Labeled “government-centered health care.” The government takes primary responsibility for paying health expenses. The government takes primary responsibility for deciding what health care services its citizens are allowed to consume. The government, then, decides whether each individual’s health care is worth the price. This is why the concept of the government “death panel” expresses a fundamental truth about Obamacare.
WHAT AMERICA NEEDS NOW is the opposite, a patient-centered alternative that maximizes consumer power, choice, and control over health care and its financing. The intellectual godfather of this approach is John Goodman, president of the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA) in Dallas and author of the 1991 book Patient Power published by the Cato Institute.
Central to this concept are Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), which were first proposed in 1981. HSAs include an insurance policy with a high annual deductible, in the range of $2,000 to $6,000 (the higher the better). Such high deductibles reduce the cost of the insurance so much that the savings would mostly cover the deductible in the first year. The HSA funds earn interest tax-free and roll over year after year. After one healthy year with few or no medical expenses, the patient has enough money in the account to cover all expenses below the deductible.
This transforms the incentives of third-party payment. For all but the most catastrophic health expenses, the patient is essentially using his own money. Whatever he doesn’t spend he can keep for later health expenses or for retirement. The patient, then, will try to avoid unnecessary care and will look for the best prices for routine visits or services.
In turn, since patients are then concerned about controlling costs, doctors, hospitals, and other health providers compete not just to maximize quality, but also to lower prices, as in all normal markets. (This competition will become more intense and effective the more widespread HSAs become.) These incentives would flow all the way through to the developers of new technologies, who would compete to develop technologies that both improve quality and reduce costs.
Federal legislation providing for HSAs was adopted by the Republican congressional majorities in the 1990s and has improved over the years. These HSAs have been proven to cut the growth in health spending by as much as 50 percent. Participation in HSAs and similar high-deductible plans has soared in recent years and may now exceed HMO enrollment.
PATIENT POWER REFORMS replacing Obamacare would expand HSAs throughout the health care system. Workers should be allowed the freedom to choose them in place of employer-provided coverage, the poor to choose them for their Medicaid coverage, and seniors to choose them for Medicare.
These reforms should be complemented by the Consumer Choice Tax Credit, which would effectively level the playing field and give everyone the same tax relief enjoyed by employer-provided health plans. Anyone could use the refundable credit to help pay for insurance coverage. Paul Ryan proposed $2,300 for individuals and $5,700 for families.
Workers would then be free to choose the health insurance coverage they prefer, using the credit to help pay for it, rather than being stuck with the insurance chosen for them by their employers. Their policies would be their own property, and therefore would be completely portable, so the worker would not lose health coverage if he changes jobs or becomes unemployed. The credit could be financed on a revenueneutral basis by replacing the Obamacare tax credits for the purchase of health insurance.
Allowing consumers to buy health insurance across state lines would maximize consumer choice and competition, which would further reduce costs. Unnecessary regulations should be repealed. That includes the thousands of state special-interest benefit mandates, guaranteed issue and community rating, and rules that prevent new health providers from entering markets, such as requirements for a “certificate of need.” Tort reform, of course, would also reduce health costs.
PATIENT POWER CAN BE EXTENDED to provide a complete safety net, ensuring that no one will suffer lack of essential health care, for just a small fraction of the cost of Obamacare. Moreover, this can and should be accomplished with no individual mandate or employer mandate. Obamacare, by contrast, for all of its trillions in future taxes and spending, and both its individual and employer mandates, still leaves millions of Americans uninsured.
Conservatives should begin by giving Medicaid block grants back to the states, as we discussed in the June issue. Each state could then tailor its plan. Some might use the money to provide vouchers that the poor could use to purchase private health insurance, liberating them from the Medicaid ghetto.
A second step necessary to ensure a complete safety net is to allow each state to use part of its Medicaid block grant to set up a high-risk pool. Those among the uninsured who become too sick to purchase health insurance in the market, perhaps because they have contracted cancer or heart disease, for example, could receive guaranteed coverage through the high-risk pool. They would be charged a premium for this coverage based on their ability to pay. Federal and state funding would cover remaining costs. Such high-risk pools already exist in more than 30 states, and for the most part they work well at relatively low cost, because few people actually become truly uninsurable.
The law already provides that insurers cannot cut off existing policy holders or impose discriminatory rate increases because people become sick while covered. That would be like a fire insurer cutting off coverage for an already burning house. If this law needs to be modernized, it should be.
With these reforms, those who have insurance can keep it; those who can’t afford it are given the necessary help to buy it; and those who still remain uninsured and then become too sick to buy it have a backup safety net in the high-risk pools. Everyone can be assured that they will get essential health care when they need it—no individual or employer mandate necessary.
Those who have insurance can keep it; those who can’t afford it are given the necessary help to buy it; and those who still remain uninsured and then become too sick to buy it have a backup safety net in the high-risk pools.

No Signs of Water Pollution from Arkansas Fracking, Feds Report
An exhaustive study by the United States Geological Survey has uncovered no groundwater contamination from natural-gas drilling in the energy-rich Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas.
No Significant Effects Found.
“For more than 100 years, the USGS has been a source of freely available, unbiased information on our natural resources such as oil, gas, and water, helping government and local leaders make wise decision for the public good,” said USGS Director Marcia McNutt in a press statement. “This new study is important in finding no significant effects on groundwater quality from shale gas development within the area of sampling.”
Chloride was of particular interest to USGS scientists. It moves easily through groundwater without reacting with other ions or compounds, making it, in the words of USGA, “a good indicator of whether chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing are reaching groundwater. In this case, the chloride concentrations from this study were not higher than samples taken from nearby areas from 1951 to 1983.”
Methane, the primary component of natural gas, can be found naturally in shallow shale formations in the Fayetteville Shale. These areas also serve as sources of water for domestic supply. USGS researchers placed a high priority on determining whether fracking might be releasing more methane into area waters.
“What methane was found in the water, taken from domestic wells, was either naturally occurring, or could not be attributed to natural gas production,” USGS reported.
Fayetteville Shale Resources
Though less well known than the Marcellus Shale formation in the U.S. Northeast, the Fayetteville Shale was used for natural gas production several years ahead of the Marcellus play. The gas in the approximately 50-mile-wide formation has been extracted through hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling, as in similar sites throughout the United States.
Another Blow to Activists
The USGS’s findings cast further doubt on claims by anti-fracking activists that the practice poses a risk to groundwater.
“When environmental activists talk about hydraulic fracturing, they frequently call it ‘dangerous’ or ‘controversial.’ But time after time, in study after study, hydraulic fracturing is shown to have a clean bill of environmental health, as the USGS’s recent findings in Arkansas confirm,” said Daniel Simmons, director of state policy at the Institute for Energy Research.
“The fact remains that there are no confirmed cases of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing” anywhere in the United States, Simmons noted.
EPA Extends Comment Period
In a related development, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced in January that it is extending public comment on its investigation of chemicals found in water near Pavillion, Wyoming. Without fully explaining its reasons, EPA extended the comment period, originally scheduled to expire in mid-January, until Sept. 30.
In late 2011, EPA issued a draft report claiming its researchers had found chemicals consistent with hydraulic fracturing in groundwater near Pavillion, but not in drinking water. EPA did not present any evidence the chemicals, which are also consistent with activities other than fracking, were a byproduct of fracking in the region. State environmental officials said EPA itself had contaminated the groundwater when it drilled two monitoring wells.

Mustard seed futures up on increased buying
New Delhi, Dec 17 (PTI) Mustard seed prices spurted by Rs.63 to Rs.3,731 per quintal in future trading today on speculators buying against restricted supply in spot markets.
Mustard seed prices shot up in futures trading on brisk buying driven by a firming spot markets trend amid concerns over poor sowing due to decline in rainfall supported the uptrend.
Rising soybean prices and local demand from pickle making industries also remained a positive factor for the mustard seed futures prices, they said.
At the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, mustard seed prices for June contract hardened by Rs.63, or 1.72 per cent to Rs.3,731 per quintal in open interest of 50 lots.
Current December contract gained by Rs.36, or 0.89 per cent to Rs.4,075 per quintal, having an open interest of 4,370 lots.
Most active near January contract advanced by Rs.32, or 0.78 per cent to Rs.4,121 per quintal, persisting an open interest of 67,720 lots.<<

Dhoni was under pressure after failing to score a run in the first innings and not managing a test century for 18 months, especially with his wicketkeeping rival Dinesh Karthik scoring 60 as an opener.
But he defied his attacking urges and rode some early scares to craft an unbeaten 76 in 159 balls yesterday, keeping his side level with their hosts in the three-test series. They survived at 282 for nine chasing 380 when bad light stopped play.
''It was very important the way he batted,'' India captain Rahul Dravid told reporters. ''It was very critical. He didn't get a lot of runs in the first innings so to play that innings under pressure was a great effort.'' Dhoni's strike rate in test cricket is 71 runs per 100 balls.
When he scored 148 against Pakistan, his last test hundred, he faced just 153 balls. This innings was made at a rate of just 47 per 100.
''That was what the situation demanded from me today,'' Dhoni said. ''It was quite hard for me but the thing that came to my mind was that it would be a tough day.
''I knew at some point in time it would be a difficult scenario and we would have to save the game. Thankfully I played a good innings and saved the match for us.'' England tried every tactic to take the remaining wicket before the weather intervened, including keeping play going by operating with spinners Monty Panesar and Michael Vaughan.
''He's got a bit of experience and he knew what type of innings was needed,'' Vaughan said about Dhoni. ''Once he got in he was a hard batsman to get out.''

Beijing, Aug.5 (ANI): Chinese analysts are claiming that authorities in Beijing have already decided the fate of the wife of disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai, even before her trial in connection with the murder of a British businessman, has begun.
Gu Kailai, 53, wife of the formerly popular politician Bo Xilai, is accused with an aide, Zhang Xiaojun, of killing 41-year-old Neil Heywood with poison in November last year.
It is reported that they fell out over a money matter, and the former lawyer also believed the businessman, a long-time associate of the family, was a threat to her son.
The case is to be heard in a Hefei court, The Daily Mail reports.
The trial, which the Chinese Government has not commented on, is now meant to work in 'reverse', with the trial reflecting the already decided decision.
Professor Willy Lam, a China expert from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that he believed it would be practically 'impossible' for Gu's defence team to overturn the decision.
British businessman Neil Heywood was initially thought to have died form alcohol abuse, but then officials began investigating and suspected poison could be involved

Samsung will tell delegates at the Createc gathering in Tokyo all about its WiMax 2 trial system, based on IEEE 802.16m with a potential speed of 330Mbps.
Samsung, in partnership with UQ Communications, claims that it will show full-HD 3D videos and 16 Full-HD videos on 4 TVs at the same time using its WiMax 2 trial systems and device. To do this, Samsung will use its commercial Mobile WiMax base station, which is currently deployed and operated by major Mobile WiMax operators around the world.
WiMax 2 is based on the IEEE 802.16m standard, which is said to enable efficient, faster, and more converged data communications. It also allows current Mobile WiMax operators to migrate to WiMax 2 by upgrading channel cards or system software.
WiMax 2 standards are expected to be finalised by November 2010. Samsung plans to introduce the first commercial WiMax 2 by the end of 2011.
Samsung is also developing LTE network phones and laptops.

UK mobile operators unite to prevent 4G interfering with TV
Digital Mobile Spectrum Limited will help to mitigate interference in neighbouring spectruum bands
By Sophie Curtis | Techworld | Published: 11:55, 19 October 2012
The UK's major mobile operators have formed an alliance to limit the impact of 4G services on digital television reception.
EE, O2, Vodafone and Three have created a company called Digital Mobile Spectrum Limited, which will be responsible for ensuring that consumers continue to receive clear Freeview TV signals following the roll out of 4G mobile services in the 800MHz spectrum band from the Spring of next year.
Ofcom explained in June that, due to the proximity of the 800MHz spectrum to the frequencies used for digital terrestrial television broadcasting, signals from mobile base stations could interfere with set top boxes and digital televisions.

Abbott ready to up the ante on boat policy
AAP
The federal coalition is poised to "rectify" the government's harsh bridging visa arrangements for asylum-seeker boat arrivals after a Labor Left faction chief warned the policy could create a social underclass.
Senator Doug Cameron fears the policy - which allows more asylum seekers into the community on "rolling" bridging visas that provide limited accommodation and financial support but no right to work - could see people starve.
Senator Cameron said Prime Minister Julia Gillard could expect a robust debate on the issue when caucus meets next week for the final parliamentary sitting for the year.
"If you have a situation where people are thrown into the community having to rely on charity then you are creating an underclass in this society," he told reporters in Canberra on Thursday.
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott later questioned why asylum seekers should have to live unproductive lives before attaining permanent residence and said the coalition would release a counterplan.
"These people will get Australian citizenship with the worst possible preparation - five years on welfare - for life in Australia," Mr Abbott said in a speech at a function in Perth.
"Now I'll be making further announcements about what the coalition will be doing to rectify this situation in coming days."
Under the policy arrangements announced by Immigration Minister Chris Bowen on Wednesday, the no-advantage test has been extended to asylum-seeker boat arrivals whose claims are processed onshore.
All will be denied permanent protection visas for up to five years even if they are found to be genuine refugees and regardless of whether their claims are processed in Australia, Nauru or Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.
The Australian Council of Social Services said it's a "new low" in the treatment of some of the world's most vulnerable people.
But Mr Bowen on Thursday again rejected accusations the plan was cruel, saying tough decisions were needed to stop people making dangerous boat journeys to Australia from Indonesia or Sri Lanka.
He also rejected criticism the government was losing the fight against people smugglers.
"We have always said that this was a complex problem which would take time to fix," he told ABC radio.
More than 7500 people have arrived in Australian waters by boat in the three months since Labor decided to reopen offshore processing centres on Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, declaring such refugees would have no advantage over those waiting for resettlement in offshore camps and that they would be denied family reunion visas.
The opposition's current policy comprises offshore processing, reinstating temporary protection visas that allow refugees to work and turning back the boats where it's safe to do so.
Senator Cameron is concerned the government will end up moving further to the right on the issue, which will be a key battleground at the next federal election due in late 2013.
"We've got to start dealing with this in a humanitarian way," he said.
"We should be giving them basic rights to actually earn a living."
The Australian Greens want a community release program and claims processed onshore.

John Travolta and Kelly Preston: Ocala, Fla.
Outside the small Florida city of Ocala is the home of John Travolta and actress/wife Kelly Preston. Here, Travolta has created the home of his (and many others’) dreams. Mimicking an airport terminal in looks and also function, it has a commercial-sized landing strip where the actor and avid aviator can land his Boeing 707, literally pulling it into the backyard. Travolta also has a much more modest Gulfstream II private jet, which he can more easily maneuver around the region. If you ever find yourself in the jumpseat, get Johnny to land in Gainesville and take you to Bonefish Grill for their great seafood and dine-at-the-bar specials. Or, maybe he can fly you to Disney World. Or New York City. Or Geneva. Jet off to anywhere your heart desires since the airport is also his house.

Rediffusion rescued by former DJ Madam Chang
Singapore's only subscription-based radio broadcaster Rediffusion has been given a new lease of life.
Former radio DJ Madam Chang Mei Hsiang has bought over Rediffusion in an effort to bring back the iconic radio service - which shut down in April 30, as losses piled up.
She will call it the "Voice of Singapore" Rediffusion.
And she hopes it will start its broadcast in 2013.
Now a Chinese-language school principal, Madam Chang said she has fond memories of Rediffusion, which she joined in 1985 after arriving in Singapore from Taiwan and was one of the most popular DJs, who enjoyed the support of many listeners.
Madam Chang has also bought all of Rediffusion's archives and equipment.
She said that while she was happy to preserve the radio service, she hopes future programmes will not let down listeners.
"Rediffusion does not belong to me, i think it belongs to Singapore. In the next step, I really hope Rediffusion is voice of Singapore. Because that's the history property for all Singaporeans. In future, Rediffusion not focused on young people, or old generation. We will have a lot of different kind of programmes."
Rediffusion is Singapore's only subscription-based radio broadcaster.
In its heyday, it attracted more than 100,000 subscribers who tuned in for everything from American rock 'n' roll music to Chinese dialect programmes by master storytellers such as Lee Dai Sor, Ng Chia Kheng and Ong To

Apple (AAPL) has been trying to take more direct control of its device components recently so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the company may be looking to build its own in-house system on a chip (SoC) from the ground up as well. TechCrunch has spotted a new job listing on Apple’s website for an “SoC Modelling Architect / Lead” who will be “at the center of a chip design effort interfacing with all disciplines, with a critical impact on getting functional products to millions of customers quickly.” TechCrunch speculates that the new SoC mentioned in the job posting will be either “A7 or a later successor to the current A6, possibly a completely fresh start in Apple’s mobile chip-design.”

Johnny Depp's attempt to play every iconic figure from the entertainment world of America, circa 20th century, may be slowing down and not thanks to Depp getting older. Following the nostalgia quotient of "Dark Shadows" and the upcoming "The Lone Ranger" was the planned remake of "The Thin Man" in which Depp was to take on the role of coolly sophisticated amateur crime solver Nick Charles.
The budget for Depp's next dip into the wayback pool reportedly hovers around the 100 million dollar mark. Considering that Nick and his wife Nora infamously lead high near-1% lifestyles marked by fancy cars, champagne, tuxedos and such, that budget could quite easily sneak higher just by virtue of making the ambiance more authentic. "Dark Shadows" got crushed at the box office and it was not just a case of a vampire being the victim of collateral damage from all that fighting in New York City taking place between caped men and legions from another realm.
"Dark Shadows" failed to connect at the box office with either those who grew up on the soap opera or younger viewers who are enamored of everything vampiric. In fact, the failure of Johnny Depp, who was able to turn interminably boring pictures about pirates into some of the biggest box office hits of all time, to make "Dark Shadows" into a monster hit may really be the big story of the summer.
How is it possible for a movie with such a big star that is about the hottest subject in American pop culture right now-vampires-to fail so spectacularly? If Depp couldn't bring moviegoers into the theater to watch vampires, it must say something. But about what? Vampire popularity or Depp's popularity.
Most assuredly the makers of "The Thin Man" have to be hoping that the future course of events pinpoints the lackluster reception of "Dark Shadows" as the beginning of the end for sub-part vampire projects to achieve massive popularity. After all, "The Thin Man" has a substantially thinner built-in audience and if Depp is on the way down, the big mystery at the end may be why it was ever ultimately decided to go ahead with remaking the movie in the first place.

CNN failed to correct bogus numbers claiming that the growth rate of spending under President Obama is the lowest since Eisenhower. Instead, host Erin Burnett reported the news as something positive for the White House.
While most anyone with common sense would label Obama a big spender, the MarketWatch report – re-circulated by the White House – absurdly claims Obama's "spending binge never happened." And CNN did not discount that argument although they twice reported on it.
Host Anderson Cooper, who runs critical "Keeping Them Honest" reports daily, missed the story entirely. Cooper said just the other night that the slogan "Keeping Them Honest" is "not just a catchphrase" but "our calling," but a take-down of the numbers was nowhere to be found on his Thursday night show.
Burnett, to her credit, provided some context in reporting that "spending under Obama as a percent of GDP is higher than most of the past 60 years" but still admitted that "one thing to take away from this is the President's story on this is much better than a lot of the American people give him credit for. I just don't understand why he wouldn't make more of a stink about it."
The report credits President Bush with the 2009 jump in federal spending, after which the growth rate slowed to a crawl under Obama. "Although there was a big stimulus bill under Obama, federal spending is rising at the slowest pace since Dwight Eisenhower," the report says, noting that spending is rising at a 1.4 percent annual pace under Obama.
Although fact-checking outfit PolitiFact was asleep at the wheel, even the Washington Post gave the MarketWatch report three Pinocchios. "The data in the article are flawed," argues the Post's Glenn Kessler, "and the analysis lacks context — context that could easily could be found in the budget documents released by the White House."
And this Investor's Business Daily piece offers another smack-down of the numbers. The editorial argues that since TARP was a loan but was included in the budget outlays, and since much of the bailout money for Fannie and Freddie was spent in 2009, spending under Bush was "exaggerated" when the TARP money was loaned out and Obama's spending hikes were blurred when the loans were paid back and the bailouts subsided.
"[W]hen you fix Nutting's mistakes, it turns out that Obama jacked up spending 12 percent in 2010, IBD argues.

Of all the emotions on earth, the one most humans seem to most freely express is anger. This is a very dangerous emotion. Mostly, because it leads to the bulk of violence around the planet.
SEE ALSO: 25 People Who Paved The Way For Dr. King
When I say violence I don’t mean just military conflicts. I mean brothers hitting sisters. I mean sisters hitting sisters (and bothers). I mean parents punching and slapping children. I mean kids pulling out guns on the playground. Its all a branch expression of anger. One second of unfocused anger has landed millions of people untold years in prison and even more in execution chambers. Don’t let the next person you know be you!
For most, anger is usually something that’s wrong inside them. It comes some say, from a false sense of entitlement. They believe that they have a “right” over this friendship, this boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, child, etc. that justifies the reason they slap, choke, or slam someone.You never have that right. Unless you are truly defending yourself (or your family) and there is no other way out, there is pretty much no reason to be violent toward another human being. May times we try to play things up to make them seem more dangerous than they are so we can justify it. We put fake moral frames around it to make it seem like we are a hero. But we’re not. Its just another cowardly act, clothed in another lie.
My son and I were talking about a book on Taoist leadership he’s reading. He quoted a line from the book “They leave the root but try to set up the branches.” If you try to set up hollow branches of fake smiles and laughs around an angry root, its bound to show up eventually.
Find the roots of your anger and face them down. If that means verbally confronting a bully- then do it. But don’t allow yourself to become a bully in the process. If you find a bully staring you back in the mirror, take a moment to really think about why you do what you do. Find its root and yank it up.
The only good anger that I have found, is anger over things that affect common justice. If you see someone being bullied, it should anger you and you should do something to stop it. Tell an adult or tell the person doing the bullying that its wrong.
If you see an animal being abused, an elderly person being neglected it should make you mad. You should do something about it. Take action! But action does not have to mean being violent. Anger is normal. But how you express it, is totally up to you. Learn to uproot your anger so you can let it empower you, not destroy you.

Ninety-nine golfers are scheduled to descend on Champions Retreat Golf Club this week for the inaugural Club Car Junior. The American Junior Golf Association tour stop has PGA Tour golfer and Augusta native Charles Howell's name on it.
//
When the event was first announced, its promoters promised a big-time tour feel. It will probably deliver.
Some of the nation's top junior golfers from 15 states are registered.
There will be some stiff competition from the locals. Evans residents Cody Shafer and Jacob Tilton have been invited. Former Augusta Prep golfer Lee Knox will play, as will Augusta juniors Shepherd Archie, Nick Edry, Dykes Harbin, Chase Parker and Clark Palmer.
More local golfers could join the field today via a qualifier that begins at 8 a.m. at Forest Hills Golf Club.
A Junior-Am fund-raiser tournament will be held Monday morning, followed by a practice round. The 54-hole tournament begins Tuesday morning and will finish Thursday.
The tournament is another reason to laud the area's golf scene. Events like the Columbia County Junior, which provided free food and no entry fee, and a recent initiative to allow juniors to play for free at local courses, are building a solid base of players in the area. Four of the top 10 players on the Georgia State Golf Association points leaderboard are from the Augusta area.
Jeff Knox finishes 10th at Dogwood
Augusta Prep golf coach Jeff Knox finished 10th at The Dogwood Invitational, a prestigious amateur tournament in Atlanta on June 24-28. Knox finished 13-under-par, eight shots behind winner Rory Hie.
Knox and Hie were tied to start the final round, but Hie closed with 62 to tie the Dogwood single-round record.
There's no shame in finishing behind Hie. The University of Southern California golfer is ranked the No. 13 amateur in the world by Golfweek magazine. He was named a Ping All-American this season as a sophomore. He has his own Web site:.
Knox is ranked by Golfweek, as the No. 86 amateur in the U.S. and leads the GSGA men's points standings. He was playing in the group ahead of Hie and said he didn't hear until he finished that Hie was 10-under with a hole to play.
Knox played with Hie when they were paired together during the 2006 Southern Amateur.
Knox's son, Lee, an Augusta Prep graduate, shot even-par for three rounds at The Dogwood Invitational but didn't make the cut, which was set at 3-under-par. Lakeside graduate Brian Carter also missed the cut after finishing at +4.
Last week, Lee played in the Rice Planters Amateur in Mt. Pleasant, S.C.
Jeff will compete in the Georgia Amateur Championship held Tuesday through Friday at Idle Hour Club in Macon.

Apparently the idea that Columbia County is politically important is all wet.
//
The Georgia Water Coalition held a forum this past Thursday at Savannah Rapids Pavilion in conjunction with Paddle Georgia. The forum drew about 200 people from 50 counties around the state.
What it didn't attract is a substantial number of gubernatorial candidates. You would think they'd jump at the chance to address an active crowd in politically astute Columbia County, where the focus was on one of the state's more important issues.
Instead, only three of the seven Democratic candidates paid a visit: David Poythress, DuBose Porter and Carl Camon. Good for them. And not a single one of the seven Republicans decided to show up.
Perhaps the best explanation for the absent candidates' reluctance to address this crowd, on this topic, is that the last time water was on the agenda, a couple of them tried to drown their election chances.
After making it clear at an Atlanta Chamber of Commerce forum that transfers of water from the Savannah River to the ever-thirsty capital wouldn't be prevented by their administrations, Republicans Nathan Deal and Eric Johnson and their staffs then spent the rest of the week mopping up after themselves.
Oddly, their rebuttal-tinged responses weren't even denials. In Atlanta, Deal said interbasin transfers are inevitable, so we should "try to minimize them." Responding afterward to criticism, he said he "will not transfer one ounce of water" from the Savannah to another region. Him personally? Of course not. But will he stop such transfers? Well, he "wouldn't support" them.
Johnson called transfers "part of the solution." In later comments intended to deny that he favors transfers, Johnson simply repeated that they should be available and limited. Good for him for consistency, but why issue a rebuttal - and criticize the media, to boot - if he's just going to repeat himself?
In any event, all three candidates who decided to show up made it clear they oppose interbasin transfers. They haven't felt the need to issue rebuttals or "clarifications" since the event, either.
The rest of them? You'll just have to chase them down to find out what they think, since they didn't find the forum important enough to visit.

With all the sound and fury of an election year rattling around us, it’s fitting that a flaming debate rages over our region. And while gridirons from Cortland to East Rutherford comprise the stage, the story cuts along religious, philosophical, and anthropological lines.
It’s probably safe to say that the Jets have only employed one player born in Makati City, Philippines, that hotbed of football gods. Ironic, indeed, that the man seen as the emblem of Americana wasn’t even born in the United States.
Such is the mystery surrounding Tim Tebow, who has been remanded to that rare vocational desert of “football player” – often a euphemism for someone who doesn’t have a position. Is he a QB or RB or TE?
The Steelers had someone like that. Kordell Stewart wasn’t quite good enough to play quarterback exclusively, so “Slash” was born. And thus Stewart became a notable – and pretty successful – hybrid offensive threat. The Steelers employed a kind of shell game where he would line up at several positions but wouldn’t necessarily end up there, scampering behind the line before the snap. He didn’t win my beloved black & gold a Lombardi Trophy, but we came close.
Does anyone see Tebow coming close? Yes. And that conclusion is based on some strange variables. Earlier this week, a caller blasted Joe and Even for daring to doubt Tebow’s qualifications as a starting quarterback, citing his glory Gator days.
There are too many Heisman winners on the NFL scrap heap – legends like Eric Crouch, Andre Ware, Gino Torretta, Troy Smith, Chris Weinke, and Danny Wuerffel – to call that Saturday award a precursor to Sunday greatness. Tebow doesn’t even complete 50 percent of his passes, yet it is blatant sacrilege to mention that to Tebow’s growing congregation.
And when you look at Tebowmania last year, Denver’s resurgence was based on an odd confluence of circumstances, from botched kicks to bizarre fumbles. Tebow’s devotees will say that’s all part of the package, the divinity and karmic goodness of the man with God on speed dial. He is so omnipotent that he can will the other team to loss as much as guide his own to victory.
Part of being a rabid fan of any club means toeing the line between excuses and reasons. The Packers didn’t beat my beloved black & gold in the Super Bowl; Rashard Mendenhall fumbled it away. Dallas didn’t beat us back in ’95; Neil O’Donnell threw it away. And thus the same logic applies to the AFC playoffs last year. Denver didn’t whip us; my Pro Bowl QB (Big Ben) and All-Pro center (Pouncey) could hardly walk all week.
Yet there was Tebow, heaving knuckleballs until overtime, where he found his unattended tight end sprinting across the middle, and laying a pillow into the receiver’s bosom before he sprinted to paydirt. It was hard to explain, and I won’t try.
And thus there’s Tim Tebow the man, even more powerful than his football persona. We often hear of players on a mission, but with Tebow the term is literal. He is just as likely to tour the world to feed sick kids, or parachute into a prison to preach the Gospel. He’s painfully polite, and yet he’s the perfect avatar of the human condition: a man bred to peace yet finds his peace in the war zone of a football field, where violence rules and prison metaphors abound.
And perhaps that’s why so many people find him so polarizing: he makes us hold a metaphysical mirror up to ourselves. He wears his faith on his face, forcing us to examine not just ourselves but the power of the modern athlete. Is it fair for Tebow, or anyone, to use his status to promote an agenda? No one questions his right to say what he pleases, and his crusade is wholly nonviolent. And considering the many reasons big athletes bogart the bold ink, Tebow’s headlines are infinitely more innocuous.
Of course, he isn’t an innocent bystander in all of this. Tebow understands his power and uses it deftly to steer the attention toward his quiver of causes. Not even the Paparazzi –perfectly sculpted and smoothed for our MTV, ADD-ravaged culture of instant pleasure – can find dirt under Tebow’s fingernails.
And on the rare occasion that gossip and gridiron collide, it’s normally the province of players of some renown, like Tom Brady, who happened to dump a movie star for a supermodel, inviting the glare on himself.
But Tim Tebow is an anomaly in almost every way we can imagine. He doesn’t come close to fitting the pop icon template: a reckless, feckless miscreant who drinks, drugs, swears his way onto the police blotter. He’s a virgin, for goodness sake. But type his name into Google and you find the qualifiers “Virgin” and “Hoboken” and “Girlfriend” and “Northport” and “Twitter” and “Gay” before you finally arrive at “Stats.”
There are fanatics on both sides of the issue. There is a strong, secular block of our population – particularly in New York City – who shiver at the mere mention of religion, particularly Christianity. They hate Tebow the man, and always will.
Then you have Tebow’s Twitter flock – an interesting stew of people. Most are benign, yet some are so rabid that I had to block them from my social networks after the tenth time they told me about Tebow’s latest, luminous endeavor, followed by yet another invitation to bible study. Yes, there are loons everywhere, even under the guise of goodness. To them, If you dare question his skills at quarterback, backed with facts, you’re a hater – even if you express a healthy admiration for the man, his ethos and ethics, his blue-collar approach to his job and bruising style and disregard for his Hollywood handsomeness while he crashes into yet another linebacker. So, yes, you can’t win either way.
As admirable as Tebow is personally, there is ample data to suggest he’s not a starting NFL quarterback. But if he is able to summon the surrounding mayhem on the opposing sidelines, as he did last year, perhaps he doesn’t need to.
The Jets were the last team he needed to join. And yet they were the best team. You have Rex Ryan, who curses like a liquored up ensign, next to the quintessential choirboy. These are the contradictions that make Tebow and the Jets so flawed and so fascinating. No matter where they finish in the standings, they won’t be boring.
Tim Tebow is the rare player larger than football, larger than sports. Some of it is accidental; the rest is occidental, even for a guy born in the Philippines.

Mets hope to shut down D-backs' speed game
The Mets open a series with the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday at Citi Field, and they'll have to watch out for what Arizona can do on the basepaths. The D-backs lead the National League with 23 stolen bases this season.
D-backs outfielder Gerardo Parra leads the charge with eight swiped bags, tied for fourth in the NL.
Mets catcher Josh Thole had a nice night behind the plate on Tuesday, throwing out two of four Houston runners attempting to steal bases, but he couldn't catch Jordan Schafer on Wednesday afternoon, allowing him to steal second base in the first inning. Thole has thrown out just six of 23 runners attempting to steal on the season.
The Mets haven't been a prolific base-stealing team themselves, with David Wright leading the team with three stolen bases. And, Arizona catcher Miguel Montero has allowed just five of 11 runners to steal on him this season.
Trying to keep the D-backs from running all over the place in the series opener on Friday will be Mets starter Dillon Gee. The Mets right-hander is 2-2 so far this season, with a 4.85 ERA. He's struck out at least five batters in each of his four starts this season.
Kicking off the series for Arizona will be rookie Wade Miley, who has appeared in five games this season but started just two. In those two starts, though, Miley has been almost untouchable. He's allowed no earned runs on just three hits and three walks in 12 1/3 innings. He's struck out 13 batters in the two starts.
Miley was named the NL's Rookie of the Month for April on Wednesday.
D-backs: Breslow stranding runners
With the D-backs up, 4-3, in the eighth inning Wednesday night against the Nationals, Craig Breslow entered the game with runners on first and second with no outs.
He then proceeded to get Adam LaRoche to fly out to right field, then struck out Jesus Flores and Danny Espinosa to end the frame.
 has a 2.19 ERA in 11 games and just two of eight runners he's inherited have scored this year.
Mets: Santana progressing nicely
Mets manager Terry Collins said he was very pleased with how Johan Santana -- who is scheduled to start for the Mets on Saturday -- has returned from his shoulder injury.
"Obviously, because he's Johan Santana, there were expectations," Collins said. "But due to the seriousness of the injury that he had, and the operation, everybody was hoping we were going to get quality innings out of him. And he's gone above and beyond it all. I said in Spring Training that if anybody can come back from this, he'd be the guy. And he has."
With their loss in Houston on Wednesday, the Mets were swept for the first time this season. They had been involved in sweeps twice prior to the series with the Astros, sweeping the Braves to open the season, and sweeping the Marlins later in April.
Worth noting
Wright has hit .266 against the D-backs over the course of his career, but he has hit more home runs against Arizona (12) than any other team not from the National League East.

Nationals Press Release
Nationals reinstate RHP Henry Rodriguez, place RHP Chien-Ming Wang on 15-day disabled list
The Washington Nationals today placed right-handed pitcher Chien-Ming Wang on the 15-Day Disabled List, retroactive to July 1, with a right hip strain and returned from rehab and reinstated right-handed pitcher Henry Rodriguez from the DL. Nationals Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations and General Manager Mike Rizzo made the announcement.
Rodriguez was 1-3 with nine saves and a 5.14 ERA in 24 appearances this season with Washington before being placed on the 15-Day Disabled List on June 7 (retroactive to June 6) with a right index finger injury.
In seven rehab appearances with Triple-A Syracuse (four games) and Double-A Harrisburg (three), Rodriguez worked 7.0 no-hit scoreless innings, walking five and striking out seven. He last pitched on Sunday, fanning one in 1.0 perfect inning in Harrisburg’s 3-1 home win over Erie.
In 115 career appearances spanning portions of four big league seasons, Rodriguez has posted a 4.03 ERA (53 ER/118.1 IP) and struck out 9.9 batters per 9.0 innings pitched.
Wang, 32, is 2-3 with a 7.61 ERA in seven games/four starts for Washington this season. Wang missed the season’s first 42 games while recovering from a left hamstring injury suffered in Spring Training.

Leonard's legacy is source of pride in Kansas City
Hurler strived to always go nine innings
Dennis Leonard had been signing autographs for two solid hours at All-Star Fanfest when he suddenly looked up and surveyed the flurry of activity going on all around him.
For a man who spent his entire 12-year Major League career with the Royals and makes his home in Kansas City, it was a rewarding scene that brought a big smile to Leonard's face.
"It's great to have Major League Baseball's big stage here in Kansas City," Leonard said. "As a former Royal and a Kansas Citian, it's exciting. Hopefully, we're going to have a lot more excitement revolving around baseball and the Royals franchise in the months and years ahead."
Leonard knows better than most how a contending Major League ballclub can light up the Kansas City community. As a sturdy right-hander who became known for finishing what he had started, Leonard was an integral part of the rise of the Royals in the mid-to-late 1970s. He's the only three-time 20-game winner in club history and finished his career with a 144-106 record and a 3.70 ERA. Modern-day starters could only marvel at the Leonard statistics which show that he had 103 complete games in 302 starts.
A Leonard day was often a holiday for the Royals' bullpen.
"I prepared myself to go nine innings," Leonard said. "As a starting pitcher, that was my job description. That was my goal every time I pitched."
Leonard came to prominence in 1975 when he finished 15-7 and established himself as a mainstay in the rotation. He had a solid team behind him, and the Royals took off as a perennial postseason club beginning in 1976. That season they got over the hump in the American League West by fending off the Oakland A's.
"There wasn't any 'me' or 'I' with those Royals teams," Leonard said. "Everybody was in it together. Being in the right place at the right time is everybody's dream. For me, playing for the Royals at that time was it."
The Royals reached the playoffs three straight years against the Yankees from 1976 to 1978, only to be turned back. In 1977, when Kansas City won 102 games, Leonard had what was statistically his greatest season. He finished 20-12 with a 3.04 earned run average and completed 21 of his 37 starts. He finished fourth in the American League Cy Young Award balloting.
"Certainly, it was disappointing to lose to the Yankees three straight years in the playoffs," Leonard said. "But our franchise was among the best in baseball, and it sure was gratifying when he finally beat the Yankees in 1980 and got to our first World Series."
Leonard won a World Series game against the Phillies, but Philadelphia claimed the big prize. By the time the Royals got back to the World Series in 1985, Leonard's career had been derailed because of knee injuries.
"I was actually on the bench the first two home games against the Cardinals," Leonard recalled. "But rather than accompany the ballclub to St. Louis, I needed to go to Florida for a little more rehabilitation to get ready for the 1986 season. Our guys put it all together and I couldn't have been more proud of the way they battled back to become world champions."
After four operations and countless hours of rehab, Leonard enjoyed a day of extreme personal satisfaction early in the 1986 season. Left-hander Danny Jackson got hurt, and Leonard stepped in as the Saturday starter against Toronto in a nationally televised game. Leonard wound up throwing a three-hit shutout as the Royals prevailed 1-0.
"From a personal standpoint, that game stands out," Leonard said. "I knew what I had put into it after basically missing three years. I had to convince myself mentally that when I put weight on that left knee, it wasn't going to blow up."
Leonard retired after the '86 season and was inducted into the Royals Hall of Fame in 1989. His legacy revolves around reliability and durability in an era when top-of-the-rotation starters took great pride in working deep into games regardless of pitch count.
"I could go nine innings with 125 or 130 pitches," Leonard said. "Nowadays, starting pitchers are rarely even given an opportunity to complete a game. They get to a certain pitch count in the sixth or seventh and that's it. It didn't work that way in my era.
"When the manager or pitching coach came out and asked how you felt, you just said 'I'm fine.' Pitch count was never part of the equation. I always felt it was my game to win or lose. That was always my mindset."

Shared insurance payments a healthy sign for Westchester employees
Photo credit: Rory Glaeseman | The Westchester County Jail in Valhalla. (Feb. 8, 2012)
By agreeing to pay a percentage of their health care costs, Westchester County correction officers are showing that they understand an important reality: Taxpayers shouldn’t bear the entire burden for public workers while they also pay for their own skyrocketing plans.
Especially not when the county is paying $140 million on health care for all of its workers and struggling to cover core services like bus routes, control spiraling costs of pensions and keep tax increases below the state’s property tax cap.
With 690 members, the Westchester Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association is the county’s second-largest union. So it sends a clear message to the other five unions in contract talks — notably the Civil Service Employees Association, the largest — that health care contributions are a critical piece of negotiations.

County Executive Rob Astorino has pushed for health insurance contributions from union workers since he took office. Nonunion workers, including Astorino, commissioners and some legislators, have been contributing to their own plans since 2010.
The 12.5 percent contribution is no small concession for correction officers — who work in the county jail — when you consider that it could cost them anywhere from roughly $1,000 a year for single coverage and $2,600 for family. But the deal also guarantees raises through 2015 — 3 percent retroactive for each of the past two years and 2.5 percent each year going forward.
And it includes a $100 increase in longevity pay, which translates to about $3,000 to $3,700 extra every year, depending on seniority.
It’s a fair deal and lawmakers should ratify it.
Another aspect of the agreement also escalates health care contributions to 15 percent by 2015 and requires new employees, whose starting salaries would be less, to pay 20 percent. The officers work at the Westchester County jail in Valhalla.
In announcing the deal earlier this week, Astorino and union president Alonzo West described a tough give-and-take between both sides and said that in the end the agreement was fair to union members and taxpayers.
The tentative agreement will go before the Board of Legislators for approval.
This contract comes six weeks after the county executive reached a similar agreement in which Teamsters Local 456, which represents about 120 county managers, will get raises and contribute to health care costs.
Astorino, who has repeatedly uttered his jobs-for-savings mantra, still has his work cut out for him with other negotiations. So do the unions.
But workers paying a percentage of their premiums is a healthy prescription for taxpayers.

Corbin debuts vs. veteran Buehrle in Miami finale
For Mark Buehrle, a 33-year-old veteran who has pretty much done it all and seen it all in 13 Major League seasons, Monday's game is another opportunity to get his Marlins career on the right track in his fifth start of the season.
Corbin arrived in Miami on Sunday fresh off a lights-out four-start performance at Double-A Mobile, but because he was not yet on the D-backs' 25-man roster, he had to watch the game from the stands with general manager Kevin Towers.
On Monday, he will be smack in the middle of the action.
"It's showtime," D-backs manager Kirk Gibson said Sunday. "It's a very exciting time whenever you're making your Major League debut. It's what you dream about, it's what you work hard for. It's what you earn, you earn the opportunity."
Corbin got the opportunity thanks to a strong Spring Training and a 2-0 record and 1.67 ERA through his first four starts at Mobile.
Buehrle comes off a hard-luck loss in New York against the Mets, where he gave up two runs on five hits in seven innings in a 5-1 Marlins defeat. Buehrle is 1-3 with a 2.63 ERA this season after signing with the Marlins in the offseason.
After winning 161 games and pitching two no-hitters, including a perfect game, in 12 seasons with the White Sox, Buehrle has pitched well with little to show for it this season.
The veteran has gone at least six innings in all four of his starts, and his lone win was on April 18, when he gave up one run in eight innings against the Cubs at Marlins Park.
D-backs: Hill extends on-base streak
Aaron Hill had two hits Sunday and now has reached base safely in 17 straight games and 19 of 21 overall.
A D-backs victory Monday would give them their first series win since they took two of three from the Padres April 10-12. They won their first two series of the year, then dropped four straight.
Marlins: Multiple walk-offs for Ramirez
Hanley Ramirez's game-winning hit in Saturday's 3-2 Marlins victory was his second walk-off hit of the season. He also had one April 15 against Houston. Going into Sunday's games, Ramirez was the only player in the Major League with two walk-off hits this season. It marked his third career game-ending hit, with the other on Aug. 7, 2010.
Worth noting
The D-backs are the lone team in the National League West that Buehrle has never faced.

The Aboriginal Memorial
Introduction | History | Artists & Clans | Arnhem land | Stories
Arnhem land
waterholes | beaches | forests | jungle | mangroves | plains | flora and fauna
'We Yolngu belong to different barpurru [clan groups] and each barpurru paints things differently; it depends if you come from the gulunbuy [mangroves] or diltjipuy [forests] or rangipuy [beach]. It's important to know the difference and we need to teach the young people to paint in this way because they don't know. I teach them by painting a picture so they learn to see the difference.' Artist George Malibirr.
Stretching from the East Alligator River in the Northern Territory to the Gulf of Carpentaria, Arnhem Land covers an area of some 150,000 square kilometres. It was declared a reserve for Aboriginal people in 1931. Today Arnhem Land is owned by Aboriginal people under Commonwealth laws.
In Arnhem Land, the right to paint is usually inherited patrilineally. although many artists paint their mother's story too. The designs on the hollow logs in the Memorial are the same themes that these artists paint on bark and on people's bodies in ceremony.
Several remote communities — some of which began as missions, others as government settlements — are spread through the region. Ramingining township has a population of approximately 1,000, including the small populations in surrounding outstations. Whilst Arnhem Land people (who in the central and eastern areas refer to themselves collectively as Yolngu, meaning human beings) have adopted some elements of European culture, they also continue their traditional practices, including ceremonial activity.
The waterhole — Gulun beaches and oceans — Rangi/Monuk
Historically, beaches and oceans have featured in many people's cultures as sites of creation, beginnings and hedonistic pleasure. The forebears of Aboriginal people crossed the ocean to Australian shores in simple water craft at least 60,000 years ago. Indigenous religious beliefs around the continent tell of creator ancestors that came from across the sea to bring life and order and to populate the land. In the north, for example, the Djan'kawu trio of creator ancestors came from the sun (east) to bring life to the land of the Arnhem Land clans. On their ocean voyages they discovered, named and brought to life the various eco-systems they encountered. The movement and life cycle of sea creatures, turtles, whales and various fish and shell fish species were recorded by them in litanies of song and dance cycles.
Just as present-day Australians live in greater numbers near the coast, so Aboriginal populations have historically been larger along the continental shoreline where a wealth of food and other resources allowed for a more comfortable lifestyle.
The forests — Diltji
Central Arnhem Land, surrounding the Glyde River valley, is a place of seemingly endless savanna and eucalyptus forests. Much of the Yolngu creation beliefs are 'born' in these forests. Both the Dhuwa and Yirritja Honey Spirits moved through and animated the wooded landscape searching for honey. They saw and named the various species of animal, bird, plant and insect life in their journeys.
The people of the forest create works of art out of this environment. Most bark paintings and sculpture of Yolngu artists from this area are vertical in orientation, and dictated as much by the medium of bark as artistic design. The vertical trunks, and art works, are emblematic of the human frame.
The spiritual nature of the forests is deeply rooted in Yolngu society. The English word forest, meaning an area of land covered by trees, comes from the Latin foris meaning the place outside the door, the wild dangerous land outside the fence. The Djambarrpuyngu word diltji also means a tree-covered landscape but, more importantly, means backbone, the backbone of the kangaroo, the frame which supports life.
The jungle — Retja
Jungles are uncultivated, densely grown, tangled mazes of tropical and sub-tropical forest, now often referred to as rainforests. To Europeans, they represented the unordered and primitive places and people of distant colonial lands. Generally the jungle was imagined to be either a hellish enigma or a romantic paradise. The English word jungle really comes from the Hindi word jangal, or from the Sanskrit jangala.
Around Ramingining are little pockets of jungle, sometimes nourished by springs, which are thought of as spiritual places for Yolngu people; Garrkman, a Frog Spirit, belongs to one place, Karr, a Spider Spirit, to another and spirits associated with Barnumbirr the Morning Star to another. Secreted in escarpment ravines along the sides of the Arafura Swamp are a further series of palm fringed sites. They are sacred places, and rich sources of bark for making string, fruits, small game mammals and birds such as the jungle fowl.
The mangroves — Larrtha
Although most common along the tropical coastline, mangroves grow in many areas around the Australian continent. The mangrove zone is that coastal belt where the land meets the sea in a tract of trees and mud flats down to the low waterline. In the Glyde River region, an important life creating area for many natural species, the Djan'kawu creator ancestors hunted in and animated these environments and gave birth to the first Manyarrngu and Liyagawumirr people. The Manyarrngu people's name actually means the people from the manyarr (mangrove) trees. The Liyagawumirr people come from the head of the river, the mangrove tidal mud flats.
Interestingly, the European word mangrove really comes, through various transitions, from the Haitian Arawak Indian 'mangle'(describing the tree roots) which was adopted by the Spanish who went there in the 1600s.
The plains — Ninydjiya
Early European settlers often wrote poems about the grand vista across the vast Australian plains, attempting to describe the new, strange, unfathomable landscape they encountered in coming to the southern continent. Yolngu song cycles describe how the original creator ancestors moved across the open plains, seeing, naming, and creating particular sites of personal reference for their descendants — constructing a matrix of experiences, intimate observations and artistic images. The Yolngu word ninydjiya, meaning a clear open space, is also applied in a personal way to describe the bald heads of aging men.
These tropical flood plains are lush with vegetation in the monsoon season, the grass often growing over two metres high. Their flooding allows Yolngu to spear fish on the open plains. The dry seasons are a complete contrast: grasses are fired for hunting drives and the land becomes bare with a sparse spread of leftover blackened stubble, which eventually returns to green.

The radiant interiors of the 1950s and 1960s did not suddenly appear without some background of concentrated attention. Apart from early sketchbook drawings and small bedrooms painted decades earlier, Cossington Smith experimented with the subject again in the 1940s. Her solo exhibition at Macquarie Galleries in 1947 included no less than ten interiors. The significance of these smaller interiors resides in the opportunities they opened up for the artist to experiment, and in their sense of return – like a persistent undercurrent in a musical score, finally rising up as a presence to be reckoned with.

Apparently the only place in town where homeboy could buy a new blazer was closed because every employee had the flu. And that’s how he ended up with that ridiculous thing which is about three sizes too big. Sucks for him.
Oh, and if you must wear a mandarin collar, leave the tie at home. I mean, would a double amputee wear socks? Exactly.

Paris Street Style During Fashion Week.
I’m going with two hours. Two hours in that it took this schmuck on wheels two hours to get dressed that particular morning. Everything about this kit is so meticulously and perfectly disheveled, it’s like the anti-sprezzatura. Are you kidding me with the sleeves peeking from the cardigan peeking from the jacket? Do the laws of physics cease to exist on his forearms? And what about those socks? No one in the world should be allowed to pull such a stunt unless protecting oneself from ticks while hiking or playing organized baseball, DAS IT!!
While we’re on the subject
I remember reading a bunch of blurbs and articles about Jamie Hince’s powder blue YSL suit being the epitome of “rocker cool” and while I don’t disagree, I think Mark Ronson’s combination of a red shawl-collared jacket and leopard print tie somehow feels less forced and definitely looks more “cool”
Mark got mud in his tires. And, sometimes, he gets his style inspiration from Vinny Gambini.

What is it about the local Lib Dems that means they seem to want to falsely claim credit. I know it must be hard in opposition but this sort of falsehoods don’t fool anyone.
This is the sort of thing that children do and makes the Lib Dems look foolish and untrustworthy. Deceit in any politician is very bad so when a party seems to think this is a good electioneering stance no wonder the public lose faith.
Only last month the Lib Dems claimed to have delivered the new Cambridge station. This was an outrageous claim that even some of the Lib Dems felt uncomforable about. And then they do it again.
The recent scam is for the Lib Dems to claim “Lib Dems win £90m for roads and pavements”. This is complete fabrication. Worse the leaflet then goes on to claim that Labour don’t back the plan.
So what is the reality? The County Council, led by my Conservative Cabinet, took the decision to invest additional sums in our roads. Why? Well, as a back bencher I spent time on the management team looking after the highways contract. I was concerned that the roads might deteriorate under the rate of funding and I know that we all value our road network. I asked for some modeling to be undertaken which confirmed additional capital spending was required. So when I became leader I was able to convince colleagues that this would be a sensible insertion into our budget for this year.
So the Lib Dems had NO influence, NO decision making and were not consulted.
I have a difference of opinion with Labour on many things but it is increasingly difficult to trust the Lib Dems on anything.

This is brilliant! Just like the Lib Dems in my area. They claimed a ‘victory’ for something locally that the Labour party won!
Great article. I hope to keep reading your blog.

friday feature: andrea fazzari
One avenue of photography I've always been envious of is travel photography. To be able to eat and shoot your way through country after country would be unreal.
Andréa Fazzari has that job. Manhattan-born Fazzari has been traveling the world shooting for clients such as Travel & Leisure, Vanity Fair, Gourmet, GQ and more. She has stayed at the most luxurious hotels, eaten in forgotten countries and photographed the most interesting characters.
Now she is sharing her travel tips and experiences with you on her brand-new (re-design launched today) blog, Fazzari Traveler.
Oh yah... not only is she brilliant with a camera, but she also speaks French and Italian.
Here is our interview, for you:
01. Where have you been the past month or two?
I have been in India (Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur), Italy (Sardegna, Venice and Florence) and Spain (Seville).
02. What equipment did you start with? What equipment do you use now?
I started with a Hasselblad and the Pentax 67, which I still use today. I'm a minimalist with my equipment and I adore my camera and lenses!
03. How has your experience in the fashion industry influenced your photographs?
I started as an advertising assistant for Giorgio Armani out of college. That was my first job! Then I did public relations for Dolce & Gabbana here in NYC. I was interested in fashion, art, photography and design, so I knew I wanted to work in fashion once I graduated from college, but didn't think I would/could be a photographer. Being someone who is constantly observing and aware of aesthetics and details, I realize that fashion was just a good stop on the way to becoming a photographer and working for myself. I don't think the industry in and of itself influenced my pictures; it was my life experience that helped shape my interests and led me more specifically to photography.
04. Traveling all the time must get exhausting -how do you do it?
The only time it can be a little bit tiring or taxing is dealing with certain airports and going through security. Jet lag doesn't affect me too much; coming back from Asia is the most difficult, but I just give in to the fatigue and sleep a lot when I return. I have a certain rhythmn and formula for when I travel; I am very used to functioning in in this way and moving around a lot. I actually thrive on it and find it exhilerating...especially when I go to a country I've never been to before. There's nothing like the feeling of new discovery!
05. Meeting and photographing lots of strangers could be very intimidating for most people -has it ever been for you? What do you say to strangers who you'd like to photograph?
No, it is not intimidating for me. I find it exciting. 9.5 out of ten people say yes! When I do approach someone to ask if I can shoot them, I tell them my name, where I am from, what kind of story I am shooting and for whom, that I would like to shoot them and why.......people do detect my sincere interest, and make it happen! I've had some wonderful experiences with some interesting people. People usually get quite excited by being asked.
06. Aside from traveling, where else do you find inspiration?
In films...lots of films. I keep an ongoing list of favorite films from around the world.
Places inspire and / or spectacular views; certain people inspire me a lot for how they look, behave, or how they live. I like observing how people carry themselves and understanding what makes them tick.
07. Where is your favorite place to visit? Sleep? Eat? Relax?
I have too many favorite places, and can never single out one!!
I recently relaxed in Laos...it's very slow there. Bali was very relaxing too...the sounds of the animals and the rain were enchanting. I'm not sure that I relax in a particular or typical way in NYC. I love Asian food mostly - Vietnamese, Japanese, Cambodian, Laotian....but also enjoy eating in Argentina and Brazil....I'm open to many cuisines!
08. Do you have moments -when traveling or shooting- that make you think "I have the best job in the world?"
Yes, I think this way quite often. My work is quite emotional for me.
09. What do you do to keep your clients to continue to hire you time after time? What do you think you offer?
I think I offer elegant and sensual images which show my engagment with the world and reflect the fascination I have with different people and cultures...I like to transmit my excitement for the beauty in the world. I'm also very enthusiastic about my work, and that's always a good thing!
10. What is your most helpful travel tip?
Get Skype on your laptop and iPhone...it's the best and cheapest way to speak everyone...no matter where I am in the world.
Did you like this interview? Please leave a comment for Andréa.
Check back next week for our next Friday Feature with Aran Goyoaga.

Wonderful and intriguing! Thank you for sharing.
I really enjoyed reading this interview. I guess since I love to travel.
What wonderful pictures. Thanks for this inside look at such an interesting lifestyle/work.
I loved this feature!
I also loved how her equipment list was not huge. And that her first job was with Giorgio Armani!
I love every one of those images. They are stunning, and Andrea is fascinating. Thanks for sharing!
Thanks for sharing Andrea, your photographs are so stunning.
how wonderful. (the last picture is breathtaking.)
I loved this interview! I am currently living overseas, traveling every few weeks/months, and speak french and italian as well. I love being creative and have interned in fashion the past two years. I am now looking for a way to put all these interests together and I was so glad to see that she did!!!
wow! she is an AMAZING photographer. her work is very poignant and her career is definitely enviable.
I am living vicariously through these images...dreamy!
I looked at the photos before reading and learning she's a travel photographer, and before I knew that I thought, "Wow, these are so exotic!" Lovely interview, as always.
my favorite interview yet! her description of her photographic style shines through in her work and echo my own reasons for falling in love with travel photography.
I love this interview most perhaps because her life is what I thrive for. Fantastic pictures, she is very inspirational.

Nothing is more depressing than a Gooner who can’t swim drown in yesterday’s blue sea that flooded King’s Road and Fulham Road. Still, it could be worse. You could be a Spurs fan.
That aside, snaps of yesterday’s Chelsea FC parade celebrating their FA Cup and Champions League victories are now up on Kingroad.co.uk’s Facebook page.
Congrats to Blues!

Underscoring its commitment to the growing population of cancer survivors, OCS launched a newly designed Web site in late 1999. The site can be reached at NCI's Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences' homepage: by clicking on the "Survivorship Research" button.
Researchers, clinicians, and survivors and their families are able to communicate directly with NCI staff through the Web site. Consumers will also learn how to become involved in the research direction and oversight process. In addition, the user-friendly site has a resource list of programs for survivors that will expand over the next year, and includes links to related articles, data, and press releases.
OCS sponsored workshops in 1998 and 1999, bringing together experts on the medical and psychosocial aspects of cancer survivorship to help educate researchers, clinicians, and consumers about the impact of cancer on patients and families after treatment ends, and to stimulate new research.
In addition, OCS is collaborating with other NCI researchers in a working group on diet, weight, and physical activity to review the state of the science in these key areas and develop recommendations to address research needs and priorities.
Rowland, who had been on the faculty of Georgetown University, became director of OCS in September 1999. Founding director of the office, Anna Meadows, M.D., who served part-time since the establishment of the office in June 1996, has returned to academia at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Rowland received her Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from Columbia University Teachers College and served a post doctoral fellowship in the Psychiatry Service, Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1984-86. She later joined Memorial's attending staff and helped establish, and became the first director of, their post-treatment research program, a ground-breaking center for providing non-medical services to cancer survivors and their families. Most recently, she served as an associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Georgetown University School of Medicine, where she established the Psychooncology Program. She has conducted extensive research on the psychological, social, and sexual effects of breast cancer on survivors, and was co-editor of the first textbook of psychooncology, with Jimmie Holland, M.D., entitled Handbook of Psychooncology.

Nitroed, what does it mean? The short answer, Nitroed refers to ”Redneck Engineering” at its best.
How did we come up with this? I am one of those “Redneck Engineers”, who is always coming up with some screwball way of fixing something, or making something work. My boss told me one day that my ideas reminded him of the character “Nitro” from the movie “Down Periscope”. Nitro was the electrician on a submarine, that had a few issues with electricity, but he was always able to get the radio working when the Captain needed it. Usually by licking his fingers and grabbing wires, using his body to complete the circuit. Well, from that point on, my new nickname was Nitro, and every time I “Redneck Engineered” something, we said that I “Nitroed it.”
This site is going to be a collection of the best Nitro jobs that I have done.
Happy Nitroing

Many years ago a critic at the New York Times astutely proclaimed, “There are really only two movies in the history of American cinema – Gone With The Wind, and everything else!” And while this reviewer could argue that there have been many fine films produced in the interim to challenge Gone With The Wind’s status quo as the greatest motion picture ever made, I would probably have to concur that none of its rivals has managed to topple the perennial love audiences continue to have for David O. Selznick’s glorious epic.
There’s just something hypnotic and compelling about this film, from its opening titles sweeping across in vivid Technicolor to Scarlett’s final affirmation to win Rhett Butler back someday, Gone With The Wind is the reason I fell in love with movies in the first place. And in my one hundred plus viewings of the movie I have yet to grow weary of its spellbinding magic, its quaintly fictional depiction of ‘cavaliers and cotton fields, of knights and their ladies fair’ or of Rhett’s caustic “Frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn.”
It all seems to fit so neatly together, so perfectly realized with not a scene or a nuance to spare, that in hindsight it’s quite easy to forget Gone With The Wind came out of an atmosphere of blind chaos and great good luck. For its time it was a movie unlike any other, and since that time it had transcended mere celluloid to become a much beloved snapshot of two ancient flowers; the old south, and the more sadly missed studio system that once belonged exclusively to Hollywood. As such viewing Gone With The Wind today is like sharing reminiscences with an old friend; historically flawed and overly sentimental – perhaps – but ultimately nourishing to the soul.
Had author Margaret Mitchell known how influential and lasting her one contribution to American literature would become she might not have written it at all. Mitchell was a recluse who enjoyed her modest career as a writer on the Atlanta Journal. But a fall from a horse made her an invalid for some time, during which she became bored and wrote the first draft of a novel she never intended to publish. It was just something to keep her busy, keep the mind keen for words. And truth be told, even after the book became the number one seller in the land nobody in Hollywood much cared to transpose it to film.
Perhaps it was the period – civil war pictures were ‘box office poison’ then…or so it was widely believed. And the material itself was little more than a flawed romance between two people. Worse, the very un-happy ending in the book was completely at odds with Hollywood’s idea of the ‘happy ending’ audiences craved. No - it was just too, too risky. Gone With The Wind was too long to be successfully brought to the screen in under two hours. It had too many frank depictions of slavery that could so easily be misconstrued by the black press as Uncle Tomism reborn. To do justice to the novel meant a rewrite of the narrative conventions that Hollywood had perfected on celluloid. It was a disaster waiting to happen should any filmmaker be so bold to try.
But David O. Selznick was just such a mogul; brash and fastidious. Yet, even he wanted no part of Gone With The Wind…at first. Thankfully, Selznick had an acquisitions secretary – Kay Brown – who, like the rest of the country, had fallen under the novel’s spell. Clinching the deal for $50,000 (the most ever paid to an author in that time), Selznick set about unravelling the immersive headache that would become his Gone With The Wind.
To hedge his bets, Selznick only hired the best: screen dramatist Sidney Howard to adapt the novel; William Cameron Menzies for production design, Max Steiner to underscore the drama with his inimitable genius. He even bargained with his father-in-law, Louis B. Mayer for the loan out of MGM’s top male star – Clark Gable – after it was unanimously agreed that the public would accept no other as their Rhett Butler. But there was one hurdle yet to overcome – finding an actress to ‘be’ Scarlett O’Hara. Hundreds of actresses tried in an endless barrage of screen test. None impressed Selznick.
Ah, but then came the dark horse to save the day – Vivien Leigh – a transplant from Great Britain, moved into a fashionable bungalow with her lover, Laurence Olivier who was, in fact, signed on with Selznick’s brother, Myron as his Hollywood agent. Her timing could not have been more perfect.
Sidney Howard’s screenplay kept the flavour of Margaret Mitchell’s novel without remaining literally faithful to it and that proved all the more successful as principle photography began. Selznick kept tight reigns on the production, though not its budget, spending lavishly to ensure that Gone With The Wind became a cinematic masterpiece to top all the rest that had gone before it. His unerring perfectionism is on display in virtually every scene.
But there was hell to pay along the road to Tara. Several weeks into the shoot, Selznick fired long-time friend and collaborator George Cukor, replacing him with director Victor Fleming, who would suffer a nervous breakdown midway through the lengthy shooting schedule. With mere weeks left in the schedule, Selznick was threatened with bankruptcy, and in order to meet the Atlanta world premiere he and his editor Hal Kern spent 23 hr. sessions in the editing room, chronically hopped up on Benzedrine to get the job done.
Plot wise: Spoiled southern belle Scarlett O’Hara (Vivien Leigh) is enamoured with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) – the son of a wealthier neighbouring plantation owner. Scarlett’s father, Gerald is unimpressed by his daughter’s choice in men. Moreover, he has been assured that Ashley will marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland) by the end of summer, thus thwarting Scarlett’s infatuation once and for all.
At a party given at the Wilkes’ estate, Twelve Oaks, Scarlett meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a playful scallywag who isn’t received by any descent family in Charleston – not even his own. After the ladies have retired to their boudoir, the men engage in a discussion about the possibility of a civil war. Rhett encourages prudence and restraint; sentiments flying in the face of more garrulous gallantry, but firmly echoed by Ashley. War is declared and Ashley goes off to fight after marrying Melanie. To spite them both, Scarlett marries Melanie’s brother, Charles (Rand Brooks) who dies of fever shortly after the first battle.
Despite frequent admonishments from her housemaid, Mammie (Hattie McDaniel), Scarlett continues to defy the conventions of a widow. To comfort her daughter’s distress – and because she knows absolutely nothing about her passion for Ashley, Ellen O’Hara (Barbara O’Neill) sends Scarlett and a servant, Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) for an extended visit to the home of Melanie’s Aunt Pittypat (Laura Hope Crews) in Atlanta where Melanie is also staying, awaiting Ashley’s return.
At the Atlanta bazar Scarlet once again meets Rhett. His wily interests to possess her have not cooled. After shocking the confederacy by asking a war widow to dance, Scarlett and Rhett develop a fair-weather friendship, mostly predicated on Rhett lavishing her with gifts. Scarlett, however, is still madly pining for Ashley and this creates monumental friction between her and Rhett. Eventually, Rhett becomes a frequent guest of Belle Watling (Ona Munson); an Atlanta madam who has come to admire the man as something more than just a paying customer.
On leave, Ashley breaks his silence and tells Scarlett that he loves her fiery passion, but that duty alone will never allow him to be unfaithful to Melanie. To ease her sexual frustrations – and quite simply pass the time while Ashley is away at war – Scarlett joins Melanie as a relief nurse at the hospital. But after a particularly gruesome amputation, performed without the benefit of chloroform, Scarlett declares that she has had enough of death and dying and vows to go back home to Tara.
Melanie has Ashley’s baby and Rhett suggests to Scarlett that she will never find true happiness if she chooses to wait in hope that Ashley will return to abandon them both for her. As the Yankee armies advance on Atlanta, the rebels torch the city forcing Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie, Prissy and the baby to flee by carriage through the burning streets. At the crossroads, Rhett informs Scarlett that he has decided to join the army, forcing Scarlett to make the journey back to Tara without him. She arrives to discover her mother dead from fever, the once vibrant fields and house ravaged by army deserters and her father hopelessly mad, lost in his memories of that gentile time before the war.
Vowing to live through this ordeal, Scarlett and her sisters, Sue Ellen (Evelyn Keyes) and Careen (Ann Rutherford) barely manage to keep body and soul together. Scarlett learns that Rhett has been imprisoned for blockade running and rushes off to the jail in the hopes of procuring badly needed funds necessary to save Tara. Instead, she decides to marry Sue Ellen’s beaux, Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nyes) after learning he has managed to establish himself as a moderately successful hardware salesman. Lying to Frank that Sue Ellen has lost interest in him, Scarlett’s treason against her sister saves the farm. But her marriage is hardly a happy one.
After Scarlett is attacked while driving through a shanty town, Frank and Ashley resolve to uphold the gallantry of the old south by inflicting their own ‘southern’ justice on the rabble. In the conflict Frank is killed and Ashley severely wounded. Only Rhett manages to save the day and shortly thereafter Scarlett reluctantly agrees to marry him. The two have a relatively peaceful honeymoon. Rhett lavishes every absurdity on his new wife, even building her an ostentatious new mansion in the heart of Atlanta. Still, Scarlett is not satisfied. She bears Rhett’s a daughter, Bonnie Blue (Cammie King), then quietly informs him that she will never sleep with him again.
More angry than distraught, Rhett turns to Belle Watling’s. But she sends him back to his wife with some heartfelt advice; that his life must be focused on raising his daughter. As the years pass Scarlett and Rhett grow apart, brought back together only after Bonnie develops homesickness while visiting London with her father. Mammie is ecstatic to see them come home, and truth be told, Scarlett is also grateful for their return. But the years have dampened Rhett’s appreciation for his wife.
After Bonnie is killed in a horse riding accident, a distraught Rhett learns that Melanie is going to have another baby against her doctor’s advice. Throughout the story, Rhett has greatly admired Melanie, and, with her kindness recovers from his grief. But after Melanie dies from pregnancy complications Rhett witnesses Scarlett comforting Ashley and naturally assumes she will at long last ask him for a divorce.
Determined to beat Scarlett to the punch, Rhett goes home and packs. Although Scarlett has had a miraculous transference of her affections from Ashley to Rhett, his dreams of their life together are now truly dead. On the steps of their Atlanta mansion Scarlett vows to think of some way to reclaim her husband’s affections.
In lesser hands Gone With The Wind could so easily have degenerated into trite melodrama. But director Victor Fleming was not just any director. Nor, is GWTW just any story. The film is at once a magnificent tapestry interwoven by a committee of dedicated craftsmen in front of and behind the camera, and by a committee of one in the embodiment of producer David O. Selznick, whose tyrannical control over these vast resources brought cohesion from the chaos and artistry that transcends the artifice.
Without question, Gone With The Wind would not have endured without the ideal actress to play its heroine. Vivien Leigh’s Scarlett has become a cultural touchstone for the ages, the quintessence of that fiery, flawed and tragically human creature dismantling her own happiness while desperately in search of it. Matched to perfection by Gable’s Rhett Butler, an unrepentant paragon of manly grace, it is the sparring between these two central characters that jet propels GWTW through its lengthy three hour plus run time.
But Selznick was not simply satisfied to give his public a central narrative with iconic stars, and as such, the character actors that populate Gone With The Wind’s backdrop are as integral to the film’s success as its principle leads. Who can forget Olivia De Havilland’s true spirit and ever faithful wife, or Leslie Howard’s complacently conflicted returning solider? These are portraits of quiet restraint and beauty etched in our collective memory for all time.
And then, of course, there is Hattie McDaniel’s Oscar worthy – and winning – turn as the defiantly human, compassionately clever house servant who is anything but subservient to her masters. In all, Gone With The Wind excels because Sidney Howard’s screenplay offers each a moment to define their character for the ages, and this, they do without drawing attention to the fact.
With so much to admire and appreciate it really is no wonder Gone With The Wind endures as the world’s most beloved – and most profitable movie of all time (with inflation factored in). I suspect it’s the narrative audiences love best of all. Beyond the sheer size and elegance of the thing, Gone With the Wind is monumental storytelling at its finest. It complements the novel without being its direct descendent.
Indeed, there was quite enough of Margaret Mitchell’s literary south in the film to satisfy the author and literary purists then and now. But Selznick understood that Gone With The Wind was – beyond everything else that had, and has been written about it since, - a good show. He never cheated the audience of these expectations, but tweaked them to suit his own artistic sentiments and the convention of the times.
Perhaps this is the real reason why Gone With The Wind has lasted all these years: because it remains faithful to the human condition. Like life itself, the film is a renewable, revisited by each generation who continue to find something new and revitalizing in its artistry. It speaks to us. It always has. My sincerest hope is that it always will. For a world without Gone With The Wind is quite simply one I wouldn’t want to live in.
Warner Home Video has remastered the film for its 70th Anniversary. The results are spectacular to say the least. This 1080p transfer sparkles, its vintage – fully restored – Technicolor dye transfer shimmering with a refinement of colours and textures. We can, as example – recognize for the first time that the dress Scarlett makes from her mother’s old drapes is not simply green, but velvet as well. Fine details pop as never before. My one complaint – and it is an extremely minor one – is that some of the transfer seems a tad too dark.
Take the iconic moment when Scarlett approaches the weary dawn after returning home to Tara to declare she will ‘never go hungry again’. Her face is obliterated by the darkness. We can’t really see her acting at all. I am not entirely certain this is, as it was intended by the original film makers, but I can most certainly attest to the fact that this scene did not look this way on Warner’s previously issued DVD where Scarlett’s face, particularly her eyes, were very visible.
Otherwise, there’s no comparing the two transfers. The Blu-ray is preferred. The audio has been remixed to 5.1 DTS with extraordinary fidelity emerging in the Max Steiner score. We hear chords and refrains once thought lost through inferior recording technologies and lax preservation efforts. But no, it’s all there and marvellously restored for future generations.
Extras are top heavy indeed. We get the superior ‘The Making of A Legend’ 2 hour documentary hosted by Christopher Plummer and an audio commentary that covers much of the same ground. There are also brief featurettes from 2004 like Melanie Remembers – in which Olivia De Havilland (the only surviving cast member) affectionately waxes about her participation on the film. We also get two ancient TV bios on Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Warner adds two additional documentaries not included on the original DVD collector’s set.
First up is 1939: Hollywood’s Greatest Year – hosted by Kenneth Branagh but scant on providing movie clips from film’s produced at other studios. There’s also Moviola: The Scarlett O’Hara Wars – a rather laughable dramatization with Tony Curtis as David Selznick in search of his perfect Scarlett O’Hara. Finally, Warner has included the 6 hour comprehensive documentary MGM: When The Lion Roars.
Warner also pads out this set with a CD sampler and some lovingly reproduced vintage junkets in full colour. These are scant on information and heavy on artwork, booklets good for a brief thumbing through but not much else. I would have preferred to read some literary essays by film scholars or perhaps had some thought-provoking reflections by admirers like Leonard Maltin or Roger Ebert. Oh well – can’t have everything.
Personally, I would like to go on record with a complaint that I consider most valid. None of the aforementioned extras are in a condition worthy of their content. The ‘MGM’ and ‘Making of’ docs look horrible, presented in 480i. This short shrift is most unacceptable. I think the approach Warner ought to have gone for is, if these extras are worthy of inclusion for a 70th anniversary (and believe me, they are) then they are equally worthy of an upgraded 1080p presentation.
Warner gets very high marks for the way they’ve remastered the film. I’ve heard internet grumblings that the presentation ought to have been spread across two Blu-ray discs split at the intermission to improve the overall bitrate. But truthfully, I can’t see where this compression has compromised the quality of the 1080p transfer. It’s dreamy and – at least to my eyes – flawless.
Bottom line: highly recommended.

"Vivien Leigh’s Scarlett has become a cultural touchstone for the ages, the quintessence of that fiery, flawed and tragically human creature dismantling her own happiness while desperately in search of it. "

City People sources disclosed that Nollywood star actress, Stephanie Okereke and her man, Linus Idahosa would have tied the knots but for some family issues.According to reports, Idahosa's parents are vehemently against the wedding plan of their son to the star actress insisting that they would not allow such.No one could say whether or not, the reason for the resistance has to do with her career as an actress or what gossip are telling them is a story for another day. Meanwhile, report also indicate that the Faith, the young sister of Stephanie's fiancee is not helping matters at all because of her role in the whole issue. She is allegedly fueling the rhythm of discord amongst factions.Further investigation by Gistmaster indicate that Linus have resolved that It is either Stephanie or nobody else.

Development in Cromer Heights / Red Hill / Oxford Falls
Hi everyone,
I know I am very new here, but I wanted to spread the word about something which may effect you guys along with the residents of Cromer Heights and Red Hill.
Some of you may have biked from the Cromer Connector up through to red hill, however what you may not know is part of that land is crown and part of it is owned by Cromer Golf course. Anyway Cromer golf course has decided to flog the land for development which will pritty much put an end to some of the great mountain biking in the area plus throw a ton of car's into the mix.
The bigger fear is they will build two access roads between Wakehurt parkway and Cromer Heights which would kill of some many of our trails.
An anonymous resident has put together a flyer, which I have scanned and OCR'd (I cant attach the PDF here) for you guys to read.
It would be great to get the communitys help to write a few letters and spread the word on this further destruction of natural habitat.
---------------------
CROMER HEIGHTS RESIDENTS
IMPORTANT
You may be aware of Cromer Golf Club's decision to develop a significantly large parcel of land on the North/North western edge of Cromer Heights.
If you are not concerned by this then read no further, if you are, then the time to act is NOW.
BUT DO NOT THINK: “THIS WON'T AFFECT ME ! "
Your council is on record as opposing this development, but the Golf Club is bypassing council & going direct to the Minister for Planning Kristina Keneally for approval! You should be outraged at this affront but it is typical of how "concerned" the golf club is about Cromer residents.
The proposed development is currently 45 housing blocks.
The average Sydney car does 3.78 trips per day (SM Herald 30-5-05) If only two of these trips are to/from home & with (minimal) two cars per house (+ visitors & service vehicles) these 45 blocks can put an extra 400+ cars per day onto Toronto Ave. This extra traffic may well be the last straw to initiate the long mooted western access to Cromer Heights (ie Cromer to Wakehurst Parkway & it's associated mass bush destruction). We will then loose the unique cul-de-sac nature of our suburb. Look at your street directory - Maybrook Ave is already shown as continuing westward to Wakehurst Parkway! Toronto Ave will then become the new Willandra Rd (only worse) - then watch your property values tumble!
(*** golf club members refer to footnotes).
Toronto residents: In peak hours how hard is it to exit your drive now? Blighs / Woodward & Cromer Rd residents: Your streets are the targeted main accesses to this development - you will have these vehicles passing by your homes!
Do you remember the bushfires of 1994? Toronto Ave was a log jam with evacuees & sightseers, it was stated then by the authorities that for safety reasons Cromer Heights needs a further access road. The population has increased greatly since then (eg: Fairway Views Estate, Pinduro Place, Maybrook Manor expansion etc). The proposed release is 13 hectares and to seek approval the golf course is presently (coyly?) saying only 45 blocks of 600 sq metres each - as is often the case(after initial approval is granted) the final development application could well expand on this. (ie When the Land & Environment Court can be appealed) - what is to stop the final development application being larger? (given it's track record the Land & Environment Court would no doubt give it's approval). 13 hectares equates to 216 blocks of 600 sq metres! (1600+ extra cars on Toronto Ave I!!!!) - be warned.
This extra traffic flies in the face of Councils "Living Warringah - In Focus" draft plan with supposedly fewer cars on our roads. Also, this land is the last tract of virgin bush catchment feeding directly into Narrabeen Lake (& includes a creek in an ecologically vulnerable location - i.e. between the proposed two housing groups). The flora (including one species of protected tree already identified) & the wildlife (which have already retreated to this area from the Fairway Views development) should not be lost forever. Why? : just so a few wealthy golfers (the majority of which neither reside in, nor care about, Cromer) can enjoy "better" golf facilities.
The Golf Club presentations to residents stated how concerned/caring they are of Cromer residents, but at the Golf Club General meeting (16 Feb 05) for members to debate and decide whether to proceed on this proposal there were caring calls of "let's just vote so we can get to the bar!" (this is fact - very caring!).
It is known that gum trees are very susceptible once their underground water flow is altered. Unlike Fairway Views Estate which slopes to Cromer Rd, this development is on the slopes directly above thousands of such trees - a huge proportion of which could be lost (not to mention those that will be bulldozed).
Numerous studies by bird watching groups have identified 153+ species within 1kM of the entry point to this proposed development - what happens to these & their nesting sites etc?
Numerous of these are endangered or supposedly protected (eg Powerful Owl, Glossy Black. Cockatoo, Kookaburra, Tawny Frogmouth, King Parrot, Peregrine Falcon etc) The first two are in fact classified "vulnerable" under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.
At a Warringah council meeting March 2005 the administrator Mr Dick Persson said: "the population of the Northern beaches is expected to fall and therefore further residential zoning is not appropriate" (surely this must especially apply if virgin bush is to be lost forever & the lake compromised - just to cater for a reducing population).. Council recently spent over $3M of Section 92 funds just to convert ONE housing block on Collaroy beachfront into a park - just shows how priceless open space really is in Warringah! Why not buy this land from the golf club and preserve it for parkland? - this would probably only cost about $2M and seems much better value!
The hypocrisy is staggering, the golf club sees this land as "surplus" - and at only 45 blocks intend reaping huge profits: probably $13M+ from this development, whilst a portion of their golf course sit on taxpayer owned land! (ie land that belongs to you, the taxpayer) They utilise YOUR land under a, "permissive occupancy" agreement with the government. How can land be "surplus" whilst they are utilising public land? This land being utilised by the Golf Club is approx 1.2 km (almost 11 acres) of prime waterfrontage (lake & creek) for which they pay a pittance in rent (the last known figure being less than $110 per week!)
If you refer the National Parks websites (browse Narrabeen Lake/Catchment etc) you will see that Dept of Lands & Dept of Fisheries both acknowledge the importance of Crown Land catchment areas (even as far away as Belrose) feeding into Narrabeen Lake - let's see how serious the authorities are with this land virtually at the lakes edge. Council recently held a summit to discuss problems with the lake re the overdevelopment of catchment areas (one outcome being they agreed to dredge, which no doubt will be a cost to you the ratepayer), you should not bear this cost whilst the golf club reaps millions by adding to the problem (and your cost). Government should not even contemplate approving this development!
The golf club will attempt to argue that a team of expert consultants have reported on proposed impacts to lake/environment/infrastructure/roads etc. Do not be swayed as these experts are paid for by the golf club, they will not bite the hand that employs them. Any adverse findings can easily be 'glossed over' or even omitted. They have already spoken about nature compatible
developments, covenants that building' heights will not exceed tree line etc - do not be swayed, developers do not create covenants which limit their own profits. These blocks will have bushland setting + lake and/or ocean views & will sell in region of $800,000+ each - no one will pay those sums if they can only build a two/three bedroom bungalow! Besides, covenants are not worth the.
paper they are printed on : eg 1) Fairway Views Estate (Cromer's last development) had a covenant whereby if a block had more than 60% non permeable coverage then a stormwater detention tank must be provided - one of the latter built homes thereon has a house covering more
than 90% of the block and NO detention tank (a simple appeal to Land & Environment Court passed both!) With that precedent now set can you imagine 45+ blocks with more than 90% site coverage? eg 2) Manly Daily 11-6-05 The Land & Environment court overruled Pittwater
Councils approval conditions for a house to be 60% concealed by trees and of a 'natural blending' colour - When it comes to the crunch do not believe these pro environment statements will actually be carried out!
Furthermore this development will be on the skyline (as viewed from northern side of lake) - isn't there is supposed to be a covenant preventing skyline construction? (so much for covenants!)The existing Fairway Views Estate development (generally on land sloping away from the lake)was actually refused by Council 29 Aug 1995 for reasons "centred on water quality impacts on Narrabeen Lake" (fact!) - unfortunately this reason has become prophetic with the lake now suffering & Council acknowledging same by a summit to discuss these problems & best remedies.
Back then the developer was the Crown (Landcom), and council's refusal was able to be overridden by the State Minister for Urban Affairs & Planning (Craig Knowles) on 5 Feb 1996. What with the lakes problems since that development (maybe because of ???), then logic would
suggest government must also reject this application for land generally sloping toward the lake. If not then compelling explanations must be given.
The Golf clubs solution to water quality of the lake? : from their community info session (25 June 05) they propose detention tanks on the lower side of this development as their means of protecting the lake. We were told when these tanks become full of sediment/rubbish etc the
development residents are responsible & they will ensure these are emptied & contents removed to suitable waste collection!!!! (and pigs may fly!)
Please take 10/15 minutes, write to Kristina Keneally (address below) and/or Local Member Brad Hazzard (who happens to be Shadow Minister for Planning) to secure the magic area in which we reside for yourselves & future generations.
Please do not merely send a copy of this document show you care enough & take time to write personally (by all means use any or all of above arguments and preferably any of your own).
Do not merely use the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) argument - this holds no sway, argue on grounds of environment / traffic / lake catchment / visual pollution / waste of ratepayer funds to dredge etc.
But please do not delay, I believe the application has already gone in (hard to know as it is being
snuck through)
Thankyou
A Concerned Resident
**** footnote for Golf Club Members who reside in Cromer: any perceived benefit you may
receive from this proposal will be peanuts compared to the reduction in your property value!'
If the development proceeds - take special note of how the money is actually utilised. Maybe more
"improvements" to your course? (I note the club trialled yellow tee competitions - because since
the last "improvements" the course is now too difficult for 99% of the members).
Or maybe once the club is flushed with funds the government may insist on "market rate" rent for
the public land being utilised? - the public will insist on this & then see how quickly your "profits"
are eroded!

I was persuaded to read Thomas Glavinic's Night Work by Steve Mitchelmore's thoughtful review of the novel. I do believe that Steve's defense of its strategy of non-revelation is more convincing than the complaints made by some reviewers that the novel fails because it does not adequately account for the circumstances motivating the story, but ultimately I wasn't quite as taken with Night Work as was Steve or some other of its reviewers. I'm not sorry I expended the time to read the book, although it has turned out to be one of those books that, for me at least, has been more stimulating to think about in retrospect than it was while reading it.
To some degree I expected to not like the book much at all, however much I generally trust Steve Mitchelmore's judgment. If it's not exactly a "post-apocalytic" novel, it sounds when first described to be close enough to that sub-genre, and I can't say I've ever been one of its fans. (And I don't mean just its SF version in particular; the post-apocalyptic novels written by Denis Johnson and Paul Auster and Cormac McCarty haven't done much for me, either.) These novels always seem to be striving so hard to "say something"--about technological development, about human nature, about what the future might bring if we don't watch out!--that I am unable to take much pleasure in them as works of fiction on a purely aesthetic level. It's not that the "vision" of human life after the ultimate catastrophe is itself unpleasantly dark; it's that the formal resources of fiction have been so thoroughly subsumed to rhetorical ends that I feel I'm being lectured.
Night Work mostly avoids this problem, although questions about what has happened and why must inevitably persist about a narrative that posits a world emptied of all human and animal life save for the story's protagonist, Jonas. But not only does the novel resolutely refuse to disclose the source of the protagonist's dilemma, it becomes clear rather early on that the source of this dilemma is really beside the point. This is a novel set in an apparently calamitous future that is not going to resolve itself into a meditation on that calamity or a satire of human folly but is instead going to explore through the actions and state of mind of its solitary main character what it would be like to be the last vestige of conscious life in existence.
The narrative does playfully leave the suggestion that the "night work" performed by Jonas's sleeping self might be the cause of his predicament, perhaps a kind of half-awake dissociative state. Jonas begins videotaping himself asleep, and he does witness what must be episodes of sleepwalking (which also start to become evident in other ways as well, as when Jonas apparently locks himself into the trunk of his car while asleep). The moment when Jonas watches his sleepwalking self peer into the camera at his awakened self (or vice versa?) is almost vertiginous in its self-referentiality. But even if sleepwalking provides some sort of "explanation" of Jonas's experiences--and it would be a pretty lame one, if we were to take it literally--it doesn't finally matter to our own experience of Jonas's story. Whether it is "really" happening or not fades in importance, as does whether it occurs in the aftermath of a plague, or an alien invasion, or through any other "logical" explanation, to the comprehensive accounting of Jonas's response to the new realities of his situation, literally dreamed up or not.
One inevitably thinks of the night work named in the title as being the work of fiction as well. What Jonas confronts is something he desperately hopes is fiction--a forced encounter with "reality" on a transformed, elemental level--but that increasingly forces itself on him as reality, however uncanny it has become. If it is possible to emerge from the structured dream of fiction with an expanded sense of reality, Jonas is unable to emerge from his dream at all, and he learns that the reality it has become is ultimately unbearable. But this is where my appreciation of Night Work begins to break down. I'm not really sure how much Glavinic himself appreciates the literary/aesthetic implications of his novel, and this reservation is reinforced by both the novel's narrative method and its prose style.
Night Work is presented to us through a more or less conventional third-person narration. It begins on the morning Jonas enters into his anomalous state and ends with his apparent death. Although we are restricted to Jonas's own actions and perceptions, we are not immersed fully into his "deep" consciousness as in much "psychological realism," and while this is to some degree a deliverance from this now stale approach, it creates another problem in a narrative so reduced to activity and event. The narration is mostly concerned to relate what Jonas does:
In the station concourse he trotted from ticket office to ticket office, shop to shop, smashing the windows with his wrench. He didn't disconnect the security alarms this time. Having broken the window of the bureau de change, he waited to see if its alarm would go off, or if he would have to continue his orgy of destruction. Perhaps some-still surviving guardian of the law would think a heist was in progress and intervene.
To the ear-splitting accompaniment of the security alarms he rode the escalator up to the platforms. Taking his time, he began by exploring platforms 1 to 11 in the east section, where he'd seldom been before. Then he boarded the second escalator.
He also smashed the windows of the shops in the south section. They weren't equipped with burglar alarms, which surprised him. He raided one for a bag of crisps and a can of lemonade, plus a packet of paper handkerchiefs for his runny nose. From the newsagent's he grabbed a stack of newspapers two days old.
The level of detail provided here (and throughout the novel) is so generic I almost feel I am reading a screenplay, or at least a novel heavily influenced by cinema. This wouldn't necessarily be an inherent flaw--Robert Coover's A Night at the Movies and The Adventures of Lucky Pierre are both ingenious appropriations of film for literary effect--but the straighforwardly episodic structure of Night Work is not particularly enlivened by its prose, which, as in the passage quoted, remains rather pedestrian. If Night Work becomes particularly laborious in its middle sections, its uninspired language seems to me the immediate cause.
Or at least so it seems, as I am judging Glavinic's style as rendered in its English translation. Perhaps the banality of "trotted from office to office" and the cliches of "orgy of destruction" and "guardian of the law" are fair equivalents of Glavinic's German phrases, or perhaps they are as close as the translator could get to Glavinic's more felicitous words. Since my German is near non-existent, I really have no way of telling, so while I am inclined to think that the bland prose style is authentic enough Glavinic, I was sufficiently engaged with his story and his intrepid commitment to its ultimate indeterminacy that I'd like to think this translation is not appropriately faithful to the German text.

. . . wrote Andy Rooney in this long-ago essay. This makes as much sense to the Nonprofiteer as anything else Andy Rooney ever said, which is to say, not much. What does it mean to “deserve” charity, beyond needing it? As George Bernard Shaw’s Alfred Doolittle memorably explained in Pygmalion,.
Philosopher Matt Zwolinski made the same point in somewhat more formal terms.
T]he mere fact that there is a valid moral distinction to be made does not entail that we want our public policies to make it. It is, after all, difficult to discern between the deserving and the undeserving – maybe especially for governments, but for private charities too.
And Jewish folklore provides yet another version. The story is told of a rabbi who gave a beggar $100 and then faced the reproaches of his wife, who’d seen the beggar’s wife wearing fur. “He told me he needed it, and I had it, so I gave it to him,” replied the rabbi. “What he does with it after is none of my concern.” The point is that generosity is the process of separating yourself from your money, not the process of evaluating someone else’s virtues.
Does the Nonprofiteer tend to give her money to causes she judges worthwhile (and therefore deserving) and to agencies she believes are efficient (and therefore deserving)? Of course. But does she worry about whether the UN Population Fund is providing assistance only to women who became pregnant by an angel, or whether the ACLU vindicates the rights only of upright church-goers? Of course not. People who need help, deserve help. End of conversation.

After equipping themselves with beam-firing phasers and adjustable vests, laser taggers receive a short mission briefing before invading a multi-level arena. Black-lit barriers and robotic crossing guards pepper the radiant battlegrounds as adversaries crouch under fog plumes and dart through colorful lighting en route to victory. Competitors can also choose to explore the celestial obstacles of the mini golf course, where dynamic hues bring three-dimensional spacemen and aliens to vivid life. Putters guide dimpled spheres across the course’s darkened felts before reaching the final hole, where perfect shots cue a spirited rocket launch and celebratory Caddyshack reenactments.

As I prepare to leave this part of the world, it would perhaps be useful to record one of my favourite longbarrows. Stoney Littleton is a small jewel set in the Somerset landscape, if you were to read the field notes on The Modern Antiquarian you would find the same sort of joy at finding something so unexpected. The last time I visited was with the person I shall be with from now on and I'll expect we shall come back and visit it again some day.
One of the good things about visiting the same place, is that you get to see the flora over a period of time, ox eyed daisies, thyme, orchids, ladies bedstraw, ragwort, etc adorn this barrow at different times of the year. The little Bybrook stream that meanders at the bottom of the hill, is clear and shallow and I have seen the beautiful metallic blues of demoiselles flying above its surface with the small white flower of frogsbite in the water below, tresses of green swirling plants gently moving in the current. Other times I have seen the pink hooded flower of balsam gracing the sides of the stream.
As you come down this tiny lane and park in the small carpark opposite the cottage, stand awhile on the little wooden bridge and take in 'old England', walk up the steep hill, past the sheep if they are there, over the stile into the small plot of land that surrounds the barrow, and do please note the stoniness of the field you have walked through, it is quite extraordinary.
Coming to the barrow, this is a time for contemplation and peace, prehistory gave birth to this place, and as you sit by the entrance look up to the ridge above, the barrow is seen as a 'goddess' symbolling the entrance to mother earth,and it is from the ridge that the approach would have been made, entering into the womb of the earth. Julian Cope in his book The Modern Antiquarian, has articles on this.

Patriots to Hold Memorial Service for Equipment Manager Don Brocher on Jan. 5
A memorial service for Patriots equipment manager Don Brocher will be held in the East Putnam Club at Gillette Stadium on Saturday, Jan. 5. Doors open at 10:30 a.m.
For 41 years, Don Brocher traveled to Foxborough ready for work and to help others. It was that selfless attitude and the love for his job with the New England Patriots that left a lasting impression on many within the organization, including Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. “He was never one to complain, never one to talk about how he was doing, he was just there to help the rest of us,” Belichick said during Wednesday’s press conference. “We’ll miss him.” Brocher lost his battle to Leukemia early Tuesday morning, passing away peacefully at Massachusetts General Hospital with his loving wife Laurie, family and friends by his side. He was 60 years old. In a business that sees massive turnover year-after-year, Brocher managed to stay …

The 6-foot-2, 180-pound Brown missed part of his season with a collarbone injury, but he is more than making up for it with an explosive return.
In his last two games, Brown has 245 receiving yards and six touchdowns, and he also has a punt return for a score.
In his senior video, Brown shows speed to go with his long strides that eat up yardage quickly. He runs good routes and shows very good hands while being elusive after the catch and not afraid of contact.

SL Green Realty Corp. acquired 635 Sixth Avenue and 641 Sixth Avenue, two adjoining New York City buildings totaling 267,000 sq. ft., from Atlas Capital Group LLC for $173 million in an off-market transaction. The price works out to $648 per sq. ft.
The buildings were built in 1902 as a contiguous department store spanning a full block on Manhattan’s Sixth Avenue. 635 Sixth Avenue contains 104,000 sq. ft. of space and recently became vacant after Apex Technical School moved out. 641 Sixth Avenue contains 163,000 sq. ft. and is 100 percent occupied, by tenants including Google and Infor. The buildings also contain 47,000 sq. ft. of combined retail space. Atlas originally bought 641 Sixth Avenue in 2007, and recently acquired 635 Sixth Avenue for full block assemblage.
“First the acquisition of 304 Park Avenue South and now the addition of these two properties are classic SL Green-type investments—sourcing off-market transactions, fully understanding their complexities, underwriting their potential and then executing,” said SL Green President Andrew Mathias in a statement. “This is a great example of how we utilize our extensive relationships and know-how to capitalize on opportunities.”
Rob Martin, of Jones Lang LaSalle, served as an advisor on this transaction.

We Walked To Paris
On Valentine’s Day, North Shore-LIJ announced a challenge for all employees. Form teams and walk the 7.2 million steps it would take to reach Paris from New York, and those that cross the “finish line” will be entered into a drawing where the winning prize is a trip for all of the team members to Paris, France.
The challenge was accepted! An unprecedented 15,000 employees participated in the Walk to Paris – forming teams, walking at least 8,000 steps every day, and having a great time doing it. Read Newsday’s coverage of our employees on the Walk to Paris.
The challenge ended in late June, and the eagerly anticipated closing ceremonies and Winner’s Drawing took place on June 18th at the Crest Hollow Country Club. Over 1,000 Team Captains and wellness champions enjoyed a French-themed breakfast and were on hand to see who would win the prize. The events were telecast live, for all the employees who couldn’t make it to the party.
Congratulations to Teams Walka Walka Walka, Microbiologie Marche A’ Paris, Champs-Elysees and Twinkle Toes.
North Shore-LIJ President and CEO Michael Dowling surprised everyone by not drawing just one winning team, but four grand prize winners!! Forty North Shore-LIJ employees have just won all-expenses paid trip to the City of Light.
Chock full of surprises, Mr. Dowling also drew the names of ten more teams to win the second-prize of an assortment of wellness-related choices, including personal chefs, day trips to a spa and gym memberships.
Much of the feedback from those who participated was the impact the walking made on the overall health of employees and their families.
Mr. Dowling noted in his speech:
• Eileen Marcel, a nurse at Syosset Hospital from team “Pain Pacers,” has been a diabetic for about 15 years. Since she started walking in this challenge, she significantly lowered her blood sugar levels, and as a result, has been able to decrease her diabetes medication.
• Monica McGuire, an employee at Forest Hills Hospital from team “HIMnotics,” lost 10 pounds as a result of the Walk to Paris. Her success has motivated her family to join a gym and start eating healthier.
• Andrea Noad in Patient Financial Services lost two dress sizes. She discovered that her new summer dresses which she bought at the end of the season last year were too loose to wear after she participated in the Walk to Paris. She and teammate Cynthia Harvey-Williams attributed their success to walking up the hill from 400 Lakeville Road to the North Shore Towers twice a day.
Walk to Paris is part of a commitment that North Shore-LIJ has made to employee wellness.
“The whole idea emanated from a large package of services that have to promote wellness, like anti-smoking campaigns, getting to know your numbers…gym memberships, Weight Watchers, etc.”
And judging by the overwhelming participation in Walk to Paris — wellness is catching on. “You could see from what was going on in the audience that it was highly motivating, people were excited about it, and people now are just doing this anyway because they are in the habit of walking and exercising and they are continuing to do it.” Mr. Dowling said. “And it’s all about wellness.”
Mr. Dowling noted that wellness is part of the health reform movement. “This is part of the whole effort that the supreme court dealt with,” Mr. Dowling said. “How do you get people to get healthier and do it on an ongoing consistent basis. As a health care organization we have the obligation to do it more than anybody else because that’s the business we are in.”

The monthly theme for May brings us to the last two limbs of Patanjali’s Ashtanga Yoga, Dhyana and Samadhi.
From the previous limb or Dharana, we learned the importance of single pointed concentration. It is the foundation for the next limb, Dhyana, or meditation. It is at this point that there is uninterrupted flow of concentration. It is a fine distinction but at this point the mind has quieted and in the stillness it produces few or no thoughts at all. One is aware without focus. One has actually merged with the object of concentration. It has often been compared to rain drops falling. The rain drops themselves represent, dharana, or intermittent moments of focused attention. When they fall to Earth and create a river, there is a merging of the individual raindrops into one stream, like dhyana, or meditation.
The final limb is Samadhi, or enlightenment or super consciousness. Here we lose all attachment and are one with the meditation. Samadhi is the state in which we no longer experience reality through our own filters. Instead we experience reality directly. It is the state in which you are aware on a cellular level of the underlying oneness of the universe. Judith Lasater says “ Samadhi is a state of being intensely present without a point of view.” It is believed that we can achieve this in our everyday lives but is seems we need the journey of yoga to discover what was present inside us all along.

I love my cheeseburgers, but...
My name is Meaghan. I really like my name, in fact I think it is quite lovely. Meaghan originally came from Meg, which is short for Margaret. Margaret is a Welsh name, although most people think it is Irish, including my parents. Meaghan is most popular among Irish Americans who, like my parents, were looking to take something from their heritage across the Atlantic. Meaghan can be spelled in a multitude of ways, Megan, Meagan, Meegan, etc. My spelling was chosen by an Irish priest that my mother was friends with, who told her it was the true Irish way to spell my name. Little did he know that pencil makers, magnet makers, keychain makers, pin makers, sticker makers, and basically anyone else who hawks merchandise to small children all spell it Megan. I could never find any of the cheap trinkets other kids had because they were always spelled wrong. To this day people spell my name wrong, but I am fine with it. It comes with the territory of having a great and beautiful name.
To make matters more confusing, Meaghan is actually my middle name. My first name is the same name that my mother has. This name, as luck would have it, is actually an anglicized version of an Irish name. Who knew? All my life I have gone by my middle name and my first name was reserved for those fine points in my childhood when I knew the shit was going to hit the fan. Now, as if the spelling of my middle name was not obscure enough, I have always been the one who has to explain to teachers or employers that my real name is not the name I go by. This whole process can be very complicated, yes Professor I am here, but that piece of paper you have in front of you that tells you my name, that's not really my name. Please call me Meaghan. No, it's spelled M-E-A-G-H-A-N.
So, that brings us to my last name. Without telling you my family name I will share that it is not a name for thin skinned people. Even as an adult my name elicits snickers and second looks. I have heard every joke in the world related to my name, and trust me there are many. There were countless times in the school yard where some kid who though they were funny and original and tried to mock my last name. Usually I would make fun of them so bad that they would run away crying, but it starts to get a little old after a while. After wearing my last name for 29 years, I wouldn't trade it for the world. It has made me the bitter angry woman that I am, so leave me the fuck alone.
My point here is people, when it comes to my name I have dealt with it all. There is nothing that I haven't experienced when it comes to the words that identify me. That is, until I took my new job. On our company email server our names are automatically entered on all outgoing messages. Fine, no big deal. There is also spell check which scans all emails. Cool with me, I am a retched speler. The problem is, since Meaghan is not in the dictionary, every time I send a message it highlights my name and gives a suggestion. The problem here being the suggestion. Is it Megan? Or Meagan? Or God forbid Meg? No, I would welcome those. The suggestion is Meatman. Yes, you read that right Meatman. Meatman! Is that even a real word? Meatman. Why on God's earth would Meatman ever be an option. Meatman. Every single time I send an email I watch the computer highlight my name and ask me if I want to replace it with Meatman. Meatman.
Part of me wants to start accepting it as a suggestion just so people will quiver in fear when they read my emails. Who can mess with a girl named Meatman? Vegetarians will hate me, children will fear me, and people will just generally be confused when I write to them. I am Meatman hear me roar.
Lastly, for those of you who know me, go ahead and say Meatman out loud combined with my last name. Yeah. I know. I can hear you laughing from here.
8 comments:
I am crying!!!!!!! Good luck with that!!!!!
you are cracking me up and i don't even know the second half of the joke.
Meatman is definitely a girl not to be messed with!!!
when i spellcheck my full name, it always suggests "Carolina Storage." nice, right?
Meatman sounds like some kind of superhero for beef, protecting the world from mad cow disease. Combine that with your last name and it sounds like a porn superhero.
hehehe...now I really wish I knew the second half of the joke.
My mother's maiden name was particularly brutal and I thank her for the unsuccessful-except-for-the-last-name-aspect marriage to my father.
I have a friend of Irish decent whose last name sounds very much like an item a woman might use to pleasure herself. She's grown a skin as thick as a meatman's too.
#1...Stop crying. I am not really made of meat, you can still be my sister.
Carolyn..."Carolina Storage" huh? If we got married my name would be Meatman Storage.
NTS...I haven't stopped saying Meatman in the deep drawn out superhero voice since you wrote that. I have always wanted to be a porn superhero...my parents will be so proud.
Allison...despite the brutalness of my last name I am thinking of keeping it. I couldn't be a porn superhero if I lost it.
Cheryl...Wow, your friend almost lives a Seinfeld episode. The only person I have meet whose last name is more bizarro than mine,was a boy with the last name Porn. That had to be rough.
I totally feel your pain with people misspelling your name. Though, I can't admit to ever having a suggestion as good as "Meatman."
I'm Lis with an "s." In fact, that's sometimes how people introduce me. "This is my friend Lis, with an 's.'" It's a family name, from my great-grandmother, and I've been told it's a more European way to spell Elisabeth (just like how they spell realise with an "s"). But I've had to fight people on it forever. And there's nothing more irritating than when people pronounce it without the "z" sound, but rather with the soft "s" sound. Lissssssssssssssssss.
I've had to deal with it for 23 years, but I agree experiences like this help shape us. And finally I have a comeback when people give me crap. I ask, "how do you say "is"? No put an L in front of it."
I feel like I opened a can of worms here, but if a good blog came out of it then I think I'm okay with that. Two comments:
1) I've received much mail from companies with my last name as Bear and spellcheck tries to make it into Bean frequently. Again, not as cool as Meatman, but I feel you.
2) I can't recall if I know your last name, but my neighbor's last name is Fatter. Just consider the possibilities there.

Microsoft To Replace Windows Live Messenger With Skype
Microsoft has announced that it plans to retire Windows Live Messenger in favour of Skype, according to a blog post on the latter’s website. The software giant had acquired the popular VoIP service last year and a merger of the two IM clients was therefore imminent. It was reported earlier that around 80% of all IMs sent over Skype are being handled by Messenger backend. It is likely that the VoIP feature of Skype, which is something that Microsoft’s IM client missed, enabled the former to retain its existence, rather than being swallowed by the latter. The plan is to slowly phase out Live Messenger over the next few months with a complete phase-out happening by March 2013, with the notable exclusion of mainland China. Users of the IM client can move to Skype during this period using the same login credentials.
Launched on the 22nd of July, 1999, Windows Live Messenger enjoyed pole position for a number of years when only a few competitors such as Yahoo! Messenger were around. Voice and video calling between computers was one of its main attractions in addition to text chat. However, the entry of Google‘s client and browser-based IM service managed to sweep away a sizeable number of users soon after it was launched a little over seven years ago. Probably to counter this new kid on the block, Microsoft and Yahoo! launched interoperability between their two IM clients to allow users from one service to chat using the other’s client. Facebook Chat interoperability has also been supported since September, 2010. Nevertheless, it seems that the IM client finally decided that now is a good time to take a bow. Windows Live Messenger was reported to have over 330 million active users in 2009, although the number is now dropped to somewhere around 100 million.
How many of you use Windows Live Messenger as your primary IM client? Do you think this is a good move by Microsoft? in the balance. Yesterday, Judge Lucy Koh agreed to “consider the questions” posed about Apple vs Samsung jury foreman Velvin Hogan’s alleged misconduct as part of a wider-reaching December 6th hearing.
The South Korean company claims Hogan failed to disclose that Seagate, Hogan’s former employer and a key Samsung business partner, slapped him with a lawsuit following a personal bankruptcy back in 1993. Samsung says the lack of disclosure prevented its lawyers from probing Hogan about potential biases and conflicting interests.
Hogan says that jury candidates were only asked for hard details about litigation that occurred in the past decade, not twenty years gone. He finds Samsung’s supposed ignorance of his past hard to swallow and publicly posed the question as to whether or not the Korean company allowed him on the jury as some sort of contingency plan: a possible way to gain a mistrial if things went badly in court.
CNET notes that Hogan in fact mentioned being embroiled in past litigation as part of the jury screening process, even if he didn’t mention Seagate specifically. The lawyers consulted by that website said that Koh is highly unlikely to overturn the $1 billion verdict because of Hogan’s actions.
Apple’s lawyers will be forced to turn over the information they had about Hogan as part of Koh’s inquiry.)
Windows 8, I want to love you, but your annoying quirks keep bringing me down.
After spending more than a year conquering the operating system’s overhauled (and nonintuitive) interface in its various prerelease iterations, I’ve now entered a second stage of frustration: I find myself cursing at Windows 8′s major changes less and less, but shaking my fist and swearing like a sailor at its little irritations more and more.
Beyond its polished, tile-based surface, Microsoft’s new operating system plays host to a legion of smaller annoyances—a cornucopia of quirks that will leave you seething long after you get the hang of all the new gesture controls and schizophrenic system options. Some of the problems are whoppers. Others are mere nitpicks that result from a lifetime of traditional Windows use. But many of these problems can be fixed, with one major exception. Read on!

Intel launches 8-core Itanium 9500, teases Xeon E7-linked Kittson
Intel’s Itanium processor launches are few and far between given that only so many need its specialized grunt, but that just makes any refresh so much larger — and its new Itanium 9500 certainly exemplifies that kind of jump. The chip centers around much more up-to-date, 32-nanometer Poulson architecture that doubles the cores to eight, hikes the interconnect speeds and supports as much as 2TB of RAM for very (very, very) large tasks. With the help of an error-resistant buffer, Intel sees the 9500 being as much as 2.4 times faster as the Tukwila-era design it’s replacing. The new Itanium also ramps the clock speeds to a relatively brisk 1.73GHz to 2.53GHz, although there will be definite costs for server builders wanting to move up: the shipping roster starts at $1,350 per chip in bulk and climbs to an eye-watering $4,650 for the fastest example.
Anyone worried that Poulson might be the end of the road for Intel’s EPIC-based platform will also be glad to get a brief reminder that Itanium will soldier on. The next iteration, nicknamed Kittson, will be framed around a modular design that shares traces of silicon and the processor socket with the more familiar Xeon E7. Intel casts it as a pragmatic step that narrows its server-oriented processors down to a common motherboard and should be cheaper to make. It’s likely that we’ll have to be very patient for more details on Kittson knowing the long intervals between Itanium revamps, but fence-sitting IT pros may just be glad that they won’t have to consider jumping ship for awhile yet.

Night Time Body Management – weight & sleep
$29.95
Sculpt, Tone and Reshape Your Body
Arise Refreshed and Energized
Contents: 30 servings
Product Description
Night Time Body Manager
supports a process, anabolic metabolism, that burns fat to repair and replace cells during sleep to support weight loss.Trigger Fat Burning While Sleeping Firm, Tone and Sculpt Your Body
Sleep allows the body – especially its organs – to rest, rebuild and replace millions of body cells that die everyday.
Your body burns fat, while you are sleeping to produce the energy it requires to perform a myriad of tasks including replacing the 300 million cells that have worn out and all of the tissue that has been damaged and stressed during the previous day. The process is called anabolic metabolism.
Science has come to understand that there are “switches” that turn on and off bodily functions such as cell rebuilding, cell replacement and the other nighttime metabolic activity. These switches are thought to be amino acids.
Skipping meals, eating fast, processed and preserved foods often contribute to amino acid deficiencies and imbalances. The signals that control sleep time metabolism may become weakened or even fail to initiate all of the sleep time metabolic activities.
Plus, as people age, their ability to break down amino acids is reduced; what once was an efficient process, becomes inefficient; the “switches” do not turn on and off.
Supplementing with blended amino acids, minerals, vitamins and herbs can help turn “switches” on and off.
NUPRO Night Time Body Management is a proprietary nutraceutical formula to support sleep time metabolism to help support your weight loss objectives. The carefully crafted, proprietary formula contains amino acids, vitamins, minerals and herbs to help promote and support nighttime metabolism that burns fat to repair and replace tissue, to help with rest and to avoid the Yo-Yo effect after weight loss.
Can you burn fat while sleeping?
YOU BETCHA!
and arise refresh, after a good night’s sleep, ready to greet the new day.
Burning fat to produce new cells, and lean tissue, while you’re sleeping, also increases daytime fat burning because the new tissue needs more energy, that is available in the body’s stores of fat, to support the new tissue.
People still need to monitor the type, quality and quantity of the foods they eat and increase the amount of moderate exercise during waking hours. Once they have reached their goal, they need to continue their new life style of healthier eating by managing fat intake and sustaining their increased exercise. It is common sense and it leads to a healthier, thinner person.
Suggested Serving: 3 caplets 20 minutes before going to sleep. 30 servings/bottle
It is important to drink 8 – 8 oz glasses of clean water, each day, to help break down fat and eliminate waste and toxins. For faster results, manage diet, exercise moderate and regularly.Add to Cart

An IDE for perl? May 23, 2008Posted by claudio in Uncategorized.
Tags: Perl
trackback
szabgab writes (aggregated on planet.perl.org) about the absence of a decent IDE for perl. To be correct, he rather acknowledges the existence of some IDEs like Eclipse + Epic or Komodo but he prefers to work with the old trusted vi + command line.
That’s fine, but like he writes in his post, some people expect an IDE as they are used to using one while developing in other languages, specially in the Windows world. In my case, I know my way pretty well in Unix (I use it professionally and at my desktop) and vi and still, I prefer to use an IDE. Why?
Well, I’ll answer this question by giving an answer to the “survey” that szabgab proposes. I use Eclipse + Epic for perl. The following text is copy-pasted from szabgab’s post with my answer beneath each line.
Beginners (especially in classes) need these:
- Good Syntax highlighting
→ check.
- Automatic syntax checking
→ check.
- Bracket highlighting and bracket matching
→ check.
- Code suggestion and auto-completion for perl keywords
→ check.
- Showing the available parameters of keywords
→ check.
- Context sensitive help on perl built-ins (including variables and constructs) and on modules
→ check.
- Pod viewer
→ check.
- Integrated Debugger (expression evaluation, breakpoints, watches etc.)
→ check.
- Mouse over tool tips for variable contents
→ not that I know off.
- Debugging: Edit and Continue support
→ check.
- Jump directly to locations (editor-wise) Perl has warned or died at
→ check.
When writing applications (the first few years) people also need these:

In short, I have found a professional and complete toolset for my perl needs. It has most of the features needed for a serious IDE and even more (like RegEx engine, export to html, etc). Now that I use netbeans for java, the epic perl plugin is the only reason I keep eclipse installed.
A perl IDE dreamed in the past is a reality.
i agree with the absence of a descent IDE for Perl. I prefer Emacs even though its not a IDE

Romney’s Former Rivals Will Host Sideshow Acts at Republican Convention
The organizers of the Republican National Convention have been trying to figure out how to incorporate various personalities in the party without turning the event into a circus, and apparently their solution is to shunt Mitt Romney's colorful primary challengers into tangential roles during the convention. Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann will speak at a tea party rally held at a megachurch twenty minutes outside of Tampa, Florida (it's called the Unity Rally, so don't take this as a sign that there are major divisions in the party). The New York Times reports that Newt Gingrich will teach a series of workshops nicknamed Newt University, and Gingrich is said to be "focused on preparing his lesson plans." Don't be surprised if all of his lessons are about the majesty of America's zoos.

From AOL Auto Section:
A New Jersey woman spent the night in jail after a ticket she received way back in 2002 came back to haunt her.
When she was 17, Krystle Garcia was cited by New York police for not having her insurance card. She never paid the fine, but was able to renew her license and commute to New York for the subsequent decade. Everything seemed fine until she was stopped at a checkpoint and had her license randomly scanned. The scan showed that Garcia had an outstanding summons, so she was arrested on the spot.
Even though Garcia had long forgotten about the ticket, the state of New York did not.
"It was horrifying," Garcia told NBC 4 in New York. "I sat in a holding cell for 14 hours with people who had gun charges, who were fighting each other."
"I've received tickets in New York and I've paid them. Couldn't they have just impounded my car instead of taking me, and putting me with other people who commit actual crimes?"
Garcia ended up settling in court and paying a $155 fine, but not until after she suffered through a long and frightening ordeal.
Moral of the story: Pay your fines, folks. The government has a long memory.
Now how would this have gone down in Milwaukee County?
1. If she was stopped in one of the suburbs, ie. Shorewood, WFB, Fox Point, etc., they would have let her make a phone call, someone would have come and paid fine, and she would have been released.
2. If she was stopped in the City of Milwaukee, they would not let her make a phone call. They would have kept her in a city jail for a few hours and then transferred her to the County Jail.
At the County Jail she would be subject to a cavity search (per the US Supreme Court).
When allowed to finally use a pay phone, on which she could only make a collect call, she might get out if she has a friend with a landline, you cannot make collect calls to cell phones. It would not be unusual for her to spend a couple nights in the County Jail before getting released.
When I grew up, we were taught in grade school that this kind of thing only happened in countries like the USSR or China or other dictatorships, and that US citizens were treated with a little respect and common sense.
It cost a lot more money to treat her like a dog in manpower and jailing, then if they just suspended her license and she would have remembered the ticket and paid the fine.
What do you think? Do you agree?

I once got a speeding ticket in Kentucky. I asked the Trooper, What would happen if I never pay the fine? He said "never come back to Kentucky", I paid the fine when I got home.
I know, a while back, Wisconsin required payment prior to being turned loose, for out of state violators.

The episode in New York was ridiculous. Frankly I'm amazed that the NYPD actually stopped someone. The things I have seen in the City that Never Sleeps...and the police ignore it. Once two officers were standing on a street corner during a four way traffic jam. A taxi had gone through a red light and had become trapped in a sea of cars trying to travel in the other direction. Horns blaring, people yelling profanities out their windows. The officers stopped chatting, looked at the mess (which showed no signs of clearing up soon), looked at each other, shook their heads and went on talking. So I have to believe Ms. Garcia's stop was an extraordinary circumstance. (A NY acquaintance kept a broom in his car for years for Manhattan driving. Cabby, delivery truck or other vehicle would get too close, and SMACK! I love New York.)
But it is a shame that citizens are harassed with minor traffic issues when crack houses and major crimes are rampant in some tragic parts of the city. The obvious answer is revenue. People who can afford to drive a car can afford to pay citations.

America has become a scary place that is looking like countries that we used to use as examples of where people did not have basic rights and dignity.
Two reasons I see for these changes are first of all Apathy by Folks who think that it will always happen to someone else, and that as long as they are respectable and upright citizens, they will be protected and treated with dignity
The recent TV coverage of the guy on Water street who was on the ground and being punched by a cop should have resulted in total outrage by the citizenry. The cop doing the punching was a sadistic coward, but because the "cops" say it is proper procedure -- and the average citizen thinks it can't happen to them, the controversy went away.
Many Supreme Court cases over the past few years have been eating away at basic rights and dignities --- but people feel it won't happen to them, so they just don't care.
The Supreme Court decided that an American Citizen can be put into MILITARY custody, sent to Gitmo, be denied legal representation, and has no right to a trial of his peers. In the name of National Security --- Makes the McCarthy Red Scare seem tame.
The Supreme Court has decided that Anyone who is locked up in jail for ANY reason --- unpaid parking ticket --- is subject to a Cavity Search !
Contrary to popular belief and TV shows --- you are NOT entitled to a phone call upon arrest !!
These are just a few examples --- there are many more.

David Tatarowicz
12:50 pm on Sunday, June 24, 2012
@Greg Does that mean you don't mind cops breaking the law --- or cops making up rules of conduct that are ridiculous --- that coward cop beating that guys head while he is subdued is somehow proper procedure --- yeah I know, sometimes a cop might get wound up, and I certainly don't believe they should be micro-managed, but when something like beating in a guy's head is "justified" there is a limit to which citizens should say -- BS ..... just saying it is proper procedure does not make it right.
Guys like that cop are often the kind that use their power on helpless victims ..... instead of condoning his conduct, the People,the Chief and the Other Cops should tell him to Man Up.
Greg

Your post, just above, makes it sound like this is something new. It's not. That was what I was saying and I have no clue how you could read into that, that I condone such actions.

David Tatarowicz
5:46 pm on Monday, June 25, 2012
@Greg I understand it is not new and I enjoyed the article -- I did read much of it before ---
I think what is new is that the police and prosecutors and legislators have become so overhanded in meting out punishment, that when confronted with one of their own, they realize how much it will F up his or her life and career, and all of a sudden they back off.
The days of a cop pulling over someone with a minor want or warrant and warning them to get it taken care of are over --- an overdue library fine and all of a sudden in Milwaukee you are in jail !!! In the burbs, they will let you call and try to get it paid ---
What is ironic is that I run a service company, and my clients would NOT allow me to hire someone with some of the records those cops have --- because their insurance companies won't allow it !!!
Remember that kid that the Shorewood HS tried to have arrested and tried for $2.70 worth of chicken nuggets, that he may or may not have had legally --- if he had been convicted of that --- believe it or not, my clients would say I could not hire him ....... No Mercy for Citizens --- but Cops and Supreme Court Justices can get away with a lot !!!

Get used to it. This is what you get when you stop challenging or promote the militarist police state. The bullet ballot is what is coming next if things are to change. One size fits all. I LMAO when I read the postings of the AA's, the JRH's and all the rest of the widdle "conservatives" that tell us that Walker and his ilk are our "saviours and heros". Reap what you sow. When you let the cops and their unions get a free pass from the voter, expect more of this crap. But you feel safe don't you? Hey, if you didn't do nothing wrong, you don’t mind being stopped, frisked (TSA style) or letting them in your house without a warrant?

i think we need to temper a over-active police force with the fact that they deal with problems that are wholly new or at least the size and scale of which are. do you listen to the scanners in Racine? do you realize what these guys put up with. There may be a couple bad eggs, but every org has that - your fear and loathing of authority has got to have some deeper roots. were you embarrassed by a cop? popped for possession? were you over 18 and your girlfriend wasn't? I'm not fan of unabated authority run amuck by any means, but MOST police officers will show you respect if you show it first.
if you broke the law, you broke the law. a lenient judge or officer is all that lets you avoid the actual statutory penalties, never forget that...
AND WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS, no matter how much the current or past admins want to ignore that

Lets see, the point is the cops should just ignore an outstanding warrant? She thought she had gotten away with it. She didn't.
I come and go as I please and have absolutely no fear of the police because I have a clean record. Know what the best part of having a clean record? You can take the cops to task without consequence, which I have done many times.
Try to find something that will get some traction. This isn't it.

Obesity,Diets#Eating Disorders#Bullying#Fat Acceptance#Please Share weight watchers, TOPS, curves, Atkins, South beach, you name it , I've tried it. 4 years ago I started in investigate Bariatric Surgery, and specifically LAP band. with a BMI of 49 I was approved as a patient in Washington and in Ontario, but didn't like the idea of the cost or of spending time away from all my support systems. When I heard the procedure was being offered in my home town, that included a pre-op and a 2 year post op program, I was elated . I started dieting and exercise under the Dr's supervision and in the 12 weeks pre-op was able to lose 15 lbs. Thats a good weight loss, why have surgery you might say. The problem was the hunger and temptaion that came along with it. I had my surgery on April 21 2010, and have plateaued twice (which was solved by filling the band a little) but as of Today, the 1st anniversary of the start of my weight loss journey, I have lost 70 lbs. I am not the same person I was, I am more confident than ever, I don't get hungry, as a small meal will fill me up, and am very happy that I have had the procedure done, even though we had to take out a loan to do it. Our medical coverage still considers it elective. To say that overweight people won't try diet and exercise, In My Opinion , is wrong. Do you think they just woke up one morning to find out that they were obese? I don't think so. Lap band surgery is not available to every one . You must fall within the criteria in order to have it done. You must have tried many weight loss programs and failed, You must have a BMI over 35, and be at least 35 years of age. I am sure these rules can be bent, and here-in lies the problem. People having the surgery instead of trying a standard weight loss program. There are many people who just don't care about the cost of the surgery any more than they care about the cost of plastic surgery. There is a place in society for the LAP band surgery, and it solves so many weight related problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease and diabetes that are all associated with obesity. The benefits out weigh the cost and bring down the overall cost of healthcare to the obese. I don't believe that bariatric surgery should be taboo, but rather a solution to a fast growing problem in North America today.
I have added this wonderful writing piece to recognize the complex issues surrounding obesity.

President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the newly elected president of Iran, arrived in New York last Tuesday for the 60th-anniversary celebrations of the United Nations and wasted no time in giving the world a clear indication of where his government stood on a number of issues. But it was on Saturday, his last night in town, that he and his delegation really let loose.
That night, at a gala event at the midtown Hilton, the Iranian president and Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator, Dr. Ali Larijani, spoke to an all-Iranian crowd. Away from the glare of the media for the first time, Dr. Larijani insisted in a menacing and supremely confident tone that not only would Iran never make concessions on the nuclear-fuel cycle, but that threats of an American invasion or use of force against Iran were at best ill-advised—especially considering Iran’s influence in Iraq.
It had been a whirlwind week for the Iranian government. Having been granted a last-minute visa by a reluctant U.S. government, Mr. Ahmadinejad swung into town on an aging Iran Air 747, along with a large entourage that also included his minister of foreign affairs. Mr. Ahmadinejad had a busy week of “getting to know” his various foreign counterparts—with the exception, of course, of his American counterpart. On Wednesday, the Iranian president gave an eagerly anticipated speech to the U.N., notable more for criticism of the United States (whose delegation, led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, walked out as soon as he opened his mouth) than any indication of Iranian nuclear intentions. He promised at a press breakfast I attended the next day that his final speech would offer new proposals for restarting the stalemated negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program.
The even more eagerly anticipated Saturday speech at the U.N. (again, the U.S. delegation walked out) did indeed offer proposals to end the deadlock, but they weren’t particularly new, and his defiant tone left American allies shaking their heads in discouragement.
That evening, however, the Iranians were in a triumphant mood and had planned an evening at the midtown Hilton, where 500 or 600 U.S.-based pro–Islamic Republic Iranians would be on hand to honor the president. (The media wasn’t invited, as it was intended for Iranians only, and no part of the evening was in English.) Yet another summer street fair had closed Sixth Avenue down for the day, and I had to walk a few blocks through the detritus of the festivities to get to the hotel, following a group of Iranian women marching uptown in their chadors and hijabs and heels, trying to keep up with husbands who walked a few paces ahead.
On the mezzanine level of the hotel and away from the bemused looks of the tourists in the lobby, security was tight: U.S. Secret Service agents with tell-tale curly wires in their ears, beefy security guards from Tehran with tell-tale stubble and ill-fitting suits, and NYPD shock troops lining the wall, machine guns at the ready. I stood in line to pass through a metal detector and then wandered over to one of the Islamic-friendly “bars”—a table with sodas and water and glasses of ice. The bartender gestured at the bottles and said, “Go ahead.” Perhaps he knew that his meager offerings were unlikely to result in a tip, so he wasn’t about to actually fill anyone’s glass.
I walked into the half-empty ballroom and sat at one of the big round tables, nursing my soda and wishing I’d brought a hip flask. A few seconds later, an Iranian official tapped my shoulder and took me by the hand, instructing me to follow him. We walked down a hallway lined with Secret Service agents and entered a smaller ballroom, where a select group of about 60 Iranians were taking turns asking the president questions. The questions and comments were mostly about Iranian exile concerns, everything from “It’s hard for us to explain the chants of ‘Death to America’” to “You have to encourage investment in Iran,” and Mr. Ahmadinejad dutifully took notes but didn’t respond directly.
Back in the now-crowded grand ballroom, a man took to the stage and launched into an extended, melodious recantation of verse from the Koran. It was quite beautiful, and it turned out to be the sole musical number of the evening. When it ended, the president, fresh from his prayers, walked to the podium to a loud chorus of salavaat (the blessing for the prophet Muhammad). After the obligatory “In the name of Allah,” etc., he delivered a bombastic speech extolling the Iranian nation. His view of the Iranian people—unparalleled on the planet in their greatness—drew great cheers from the audience, but he refrained from discussing the nuclear issue and instead invited Dr. Larijani to the microphone to explain Iran’s nuclear stance in detail.
Dr. Larijani, an elegant man in a well-tailored suit, began by saying that Iran would “never, ever” give up its right to peaceful nuclear energy. He compared Iran’s sovereignty over its nuclear-fuel cycle to Iran’s immensely popular nationalization of the oil industry in the last century—a clever analogy that drew thunderous applause from the crowd. Dr. Larijani also recounted that he had told Jack Straw, the British foreign minister, that Iranians still view Britain with deep suspicion because of the oil concession of a century ago, and had warned him that Britain “should not repeat the same mistake when it came to nuclear power.” He waited for the applause to die down before he moved on to address the possibility of being referred to the Security Council. Dr. Larijani said that even if a veto of a resolution by a friendly state (read: China or Russia) was possible, Iran would still rely on nothing in its nuclear negotiations: “nothing but the will of the Iranian people.” He beamed as the audience again applauded enthusiastically.
It occurred to me that Dr. Larijani knew that whatever he was saying this evening would land, translated by the C.I.A., on the desk of Condoleezza Rice the next morning, courtesy of a spy or two in the audience or a listening device in the room. The message was in crystal-clear Farsi: Iran was moving ahead with its nuclear plans, like it or not, go tell your masters.
At the end of his speech, his eyes scanned the room (was he looking for the spy?) before he made two direct references to the U.S.: first, that America would not and could not act militarily against Iran, as it is too busy with the messy “soup” it’s created in Iraq; and second, that the U.S. should know that the reason the Shiites of Iraq are tolerating, if not cooperating, with the occupiers is “because of Iran”—and only because of Iran. That was as close to “Bring it on” as it gets, and Dr. Larijani’s Cheshire-cat grin while basking in the applause was a telling sign of the confidence the Iranians felt at the end of their New York stay.
After his speech, people rushed to the buffet tables laden with kebabs and rice outside; inside the ballroom, President Ahmadinejad was making a valiant effort to visit every table before heading for the airport, but the crowd gathered around him prevented him from moving far. Despite repeated requests by the U.N. ambassador for people to take their seats, the Iranians somehow didn’t believe his promise that the president would actually say hello to each and every person present, and they ignored the ambassador’s pleas. Not long after, Mr. Ahmadinejad left New York for the long flight home, and the Iranians left for their own homes maybe a few blocks away—some perhaps a little envious that, unlike their president, they would wake up the next morning still in the land of the Great Satan.

Bill Moyers Essay: Take Action on Filibuster Reform
When a political party’s in the majority, it wants to change the filibuster… until it falls from power and winds up the minority. Then it suddenly becomes the filibuster’s biggest supporter. In this web-only exclusive, Bill Moyers says such hypocrisy “has cost the Congress its standing in public respect and cost our democracy the capacity to address the problems that threaten to overwhelm us.”
But hope of resurrecting the Senate’s noble purpose by reforming the filibuster is being championed by a diverse group of organizations and activists, including The Democratic Initiative and Fix the Senate Now. They want to take the filibuster, which can now be easily and quietly activated, and restore its original, public use (Think Mr. Smith or Mr. Sanders). Time is not on their side, however. Unless the Senate reforms the filibuster at the beginning of the new 113th Congress — that’s as soon as next Tuesday, January 22 — the minority wrecking crew remains in charge for the next two years.
See four suggestions below to make your opinion loud and clear. Learn even more by watching Bill’s conversation with union leader Larry Cohen this weekend.
As Bill says, “End the silence. Speak up now. But do it quickly — the clock’s ticking.”
A Filibuster Reform To-Do List:
1. Contact your senator to tell him or her that you support filibuster reform and the end of the silent filibuster. Calling 1-888-717-0911 will connect you automatically based on where you call from. You can also find Senate contact information here. Or call Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (202-224-3542) or Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( 202-224-2541) directly, and tell them where you stand.
2. Share graphics on your Facebook timeline letting your friends know that you support filibuster reform. Download graphics made by Fix the Senate Now at their website.
3. Follow #FixtheSenate tweets and send your own tweet with your position on the issue. Also, tweet any interactions or contact efforts you had with senators.
4. Link to or embed Fix the Senate Now’s YouTube video.

Forum Post: Disclosure Petition. Sign here to get cash out of elections.
Posted 6 months ago on Oct. 26, 2012, 9:44 p.m. EST by Builder
(3696)
This content is user submitted and not an official statement
Big Money is buying the 2012 elections in secret. To escape accountability for their political spending, Wall Street corporations and super-rich donors like the Koch Brothers are pumping upwards of $900 million dollars into shadowy tax-exempt nonprofit groups that can spend unlimited money influencing elections without having to reveal a single donor.*
Let’s face it - our bought Congress no longer represents the will of the people. 88% of American voters think that “all campaign contributions and expenditures should be publicly disclosed.” And they are right. In the words of Bill Moyers, “three things don’t go together: money, secrecy, democracy."
Dark Money has got to go. If Congress will not act to save American democracy - we will. It’s time to take the demand for disclosure directly to the worst of the 1%, and insist they immediately release all records of any anonymous political expenditures. The Koch Brothers of the world think we don’t know or care what they’re up to: add your name to the petition and show them they’re wrong.
We delivered this petition to Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase on September 28th. Both have failed to respond, and 8 were arrested in Los Angeles when they peacefully refused to leave until BofA complied. But we will keep coming back, and our civil disobedience actions will only continue to grow until our simple demand is made impossible to ignore.
We need at least 1,000 people to sign on to this call before our next wave of actions mid-October so the deep patriots who will risk arrest to ensure our voice is heard will know a growing movement has got their back!
signed - BUT
telling the bully to stop is not likely to work
the only way to beat billions of dollars is with thousands of votes [ think 2000 & 537 Florida votes ]
stop it at the legal level
it requires us to do more than sign a petition -
BUT WHEN DONE - IT WILL SUCCEED
Signed
Thankyou Nevada1.
This is not your concern. Worry about your own nation.
Does root your boot have any negative connotations for you?
Thanks for the bump.
Does interfering where you have no business ring a bell? Go away foreign garbage....
Wow, do you kiss your goat with that mouth?
If Builder is trying to help us from another country it makes his effort that much wiser.
It's called Earth.
More bumpage? Thanks.
You have several dysfuncional fixings in your brain, my friend.
Screws loose, in other words.
Please don't call me your friend. I'm a confirmed opponent of the left. And since you don't answer other than with flippant bullshit I see I'm right.
Never heard of the ANZUS treaty?
American politics affects Australia greatly, particularly foreign policy, if that's what you could call it.
Aren't you tired of hearing about all your young men and women coming home in body bags? Or disfigured for life? Or suffering permanent mental scarring from what your oligarchs are pushing them into?
There hasn't been a war or invasion that was any more than a front for corporate greed since Pearl Harbour.
You reap what you sow, Grim.

Victory! Strict Shark Finning Ban Moves Forward in Europe
Today we moved closer to a complete ban on shark finning in the European Union!
The Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament voted in Brussels today to support a strict ban on shark finning, both in European Union waters and on EU ships worldwide. The European Union contains several major shark fishing nations, responsible for 14% of all reported shark catches worldwide.
This new policy would close loopholes in EU’s existing shark finning policy, which allowed some vessels to remove fins at sea. It will have to be approved by the rest of the Parliament before it can go into effect.
Shark finning is a cruel and wasteful practice where fishers cut off a shark’s fins, often while it is still alive, and then toss the rest of the shark overboard to die. Sharks everywhere are facing strong fishing pressures, with many species now classified as threatened or endangered. When only fins are collected, more sharks can be caught, and the species may not be identifiable on-shore, putting threatened and endangered sharks at more risk.
The Shark Conservation Act of 2010 made shark finning illegal in US waters, requiring fishers to bring the entire shark to shore. In the EU, shark finning has technically been prohibited since 2003, but the policy voted on today will remove an exemption that allowed some vessels to continue removing fins on-board and made enforcement of the ban difficult.
Put together, EU countries form the largest shark fishing entity in the world, and we are thrilled that the Parliament is taking this important step to protect sharks in their waters, after several years of campaigning by Oceana's team in Europe. “The vote of the Fisheries Committee sends a strong message to the wider Parliament: the EU, which catches the largest share of sharks worldwide, must set a global example when it comes to policy on shark finning,” says Xavier Pastor, Executive Direction of Oceana Europe..

Elvin Roytman and Bein' It Productions will present the Off-Broadway run of Gina Kim and Ryan Tofil's MISS KIM, a daring and brutally honest new play about a young Korean- American woman at war with her abusers, her family and herself, January 17 to 29th at the 45th Street Theatre. Matthew Corozine directs the production that will officially open on January 20..
"Sexual abuse is a subject most people simply don't want to talk about," explains Director Matthew Corozine, "especially in the Korean culture, which is ironic, because Korea has one of the highest populations of sex offenders. But stories like Gina's need to be told to let survivors see that the past is really the past and that they're still whole, complete and worthy of living a fulfilling life."
The cast of MISS KIM includes Broadway's Kathy Dietch (Wicked, Footloose, Hair at Encores!), Tessa Faye, Justin Gentry, Gina Kim, Matthew McCurdy and Ryan Tofil.
Gina Kim recently produced 2 short films and currently in process of creating her first musical. She has performed back-up vocals for K-POP stars in Korea, various pageant competitions, singing competitions, Regional Theatre (Flower Drum Song as Mei Li), Local Theatre (Chorus Line as Connie), and the 2011 NYC Koreatown Vagina Monologues in addition to working in Finance, which she has for 13 years. She has degrees from New York University and Hunter College with a BA in Psychology and Economics.
Ryan Tofil (Playwright) teaches acting at the Mathew Corozine Studio (MCS) in Times Square and has also taught and directed preteens at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA). He also teaches Special Education in the NYC public school system. Ryan has a Bachelor of Fine Arts in musical theatre from the New School University, with an additional focus on creative writing. He co-wrote and performed in the critically acclaimed MISS KIM, THE PLAY, which was originally produced through MCS and FringeNYC in 2010. He is currently writing and work-shopping a new play shining a homosexual light on the biblical laws of Leviticus titled, LEVITICUS IN LOVE.
Matthew Corozine (Director) has been training actors "to get outta their head" since 2000. He created the Matthew Corozine Studio Theatre (MCS) in NYC, an acting studio rooted in The Meisner Technique and is proud to "house" working actors, budding talent, a teaching staff of 4 (MCS musical theatre class coming soon) and a support staff of 3 and growing! In NYC, Matthew Corozine and his acting studio have produced and directed over 15 productions. In 2009, Matthew Corozine directed the FRINGEnyc critically acclaimed hit, THE BOYS UPSTAIRS, (Soho Playhouse) that was extended as part of the FRINGEnyc Encore Series. For the 2010 FRINGEnyc Matthew directed MISS KIM written by MCS' Ryan Tofil (Acting Teacher) and Gina Kim (inspired by the personal monologue exercises at MCS). Matthew also has guest coached on Reality TV. MCS students have appeared in film/tv in LA and NYC on Broadway in WICKED; LEGALLY BLONDE, GYPSY, THE ADDAMS FAMILY; ROCK OF AGES; BOOK OF MORMON; ANYTHING GOES; WONDERLAND, RENT among others. MCS hopes to expand and build a bigger theatre and offices in 2012.
Set and lighting design are by David S. Goldstein, costume design is by Michelle Eden Humphrey and the Stage Manager is Laura Hirschberg.
Performances of MISS KIM are Thursday's - Sundays. Thursday and Friday at 8PM, Saturday at 7PM. Matinee performances are on Saturdays and Sundays at 2PM.

Dallas Office Sublease
Dallas Office Sublease
Our favorite types of leases to work with are Dallas office subleases. There are so many positive reasons that a sublease should be considered by an office tenant but as with all decisions there are potential negative results if everything isn’t considered by the sub-lessee.
When a tenant is considering an option to lease space from a particular building it is important that the tenant determine of there are any sublease spaces available in the building prior to contacting the building’s leasing agent. If a tenant has already contacted the building and at a later time discovers a sublease space that is ideal and thirty five percent cheaper than a direct deal they may have eliminated themselves from being approved my the landlord for the Dallas office sublease. Why would this happen? Because, in most leases the landlord restricts the sub-lessor from leasing to anybody that the landlord or their agents are talking to about space in the building or to any other existing tenants within the building.
A tenant can avoid this pitfall by working closely with a professional that has years of experience in negotiating Dallas office sublease space. It is important that before a building is contacted that all known sublease options are reviewed and a determination is made to their viability as a future location for the tenant.
Reasons For A Dallas Office Sublease
Why do you want a Dallas office sublease? Here are many of the reasons given by our clients, shorter term lease, significant rental rate reductions, furniture could be included in the deal, telecommunications and network systems could be included in the Dallas office sublease and the space is usually ready for immediate occupancy.
All of these are great reasons however the Dallas office sublease client need to never forget two important issues that could have serious negative consequences for their business. First is that a sublease is only as good as the credit of the sub-lesser. If the tenant that the sub-tenant is leasing from goes into default then the sub-tenant has no lease or space and most likely will be given a short notice to move out of the building. Secondly once the negotiation of the sublease is complete the building’s landlord must approve the sublease
Landlord’s Consent Dallas Office Sublease
Most landlords will not even review a sublease until the negotiation between the sub-lessor and the sub-lessee is complete and the sublease is executed. The landlord will then issue a landlord’s consent to sublease and this could be presented within a few days or it could take a few weeks. Once the landlord’s consent is issued the sub-lesser and sub-lessee sign it and the Dallas office sublease is approved after the landlord executes their consent document.
All things being considered we love subleases for our clients. Yes there are a few hurtles that need to be jumped over but the money that can be saved is well worth the risk for the right client. In our opinion the only firm that shouldn’t consider a Dallas office sublease is one that has a very short term timeline and needs a Dallas office lease in less than thirty days.

Dallas Office Brokers
Dallas Office Brokers
When looking for Dallas Office brokers to represent your interests you need to be aware of the different types of services that brokers can offer to their clients. Brokerage services fall into three main categories, buyers’ agent, seller’s agent or intermediary. It is important that the consumer of brokerages services understands the difference.
Upon first contact with a licensed Texas broker or agent they should provide you with an Agency disclosure form, which is required to be delivered upon first contact with a consumer of the Dallas office brokers prospect. The Texas Real Estate Commission require this form to be presented so that it helps to inform the individual talking with the broker that they need to know what side the broker represents.
Dallas Office Brokers Representation
Many times I speak with a tenant that has been speaking with various Dallas office brokers and they refer to the broker as their broker when in fact the broker is representing the interests of the landlord. “Their Dallas office brokers” responsibility is to the building not to the tenant. They must treat the tenant with respect and be truthful but their ultimate responsibility is to the landlord.
So how does a tenant know if the Dallas office brokers they are working with are looking out for their best outcome? This may sound crazy but the broker they are working with will usually have a signed Tenant Representation Agreement with the tenant indicating that they are obligated to the tenant and what their responsibilities are to the tenant. Without a written contract with broker the tenant really doesn’t have a broker representing them and their broker would be like all the other Dallas office brokers looking out for the interests of the landlord.
Unfortunately some tenants don’t want to sign a contract with a tenant representation broker. We think this is because they don’t understand that if they did they would automatically bring onto their team a dedicated professional that understands that Dallas office market and has complete fiduciary responsibility to them.
Dallas Office Brokers Contract
Sometimes the tenant doesn’t want to sign a contract because of bad experiences they may have had in the past. We believe that it is imperative that when a tenant is looking for Dallas office brokers to represent them that they look for professionals that only specialize in Dallas office tenant representation. By doing so they remove all potential conflicts of interest and they know that their broker is totally focused on only representing tenant’s interests and not any landlord’s. Additionally this type of broker has been immersed in thousands of hours of experience dealing with tenant’s issues and completely understands the concerns and issues a tenant may face in a lease negotiation.
When looking for a broker look for one that has had many years of personal experience assisting Dallas office tenants find good leases for their firms. Some Dallas office brokers are with old firms but they have six months of experience. We think it is better to have a broker with twenty years experience that can draw upon their own experiences to help a tenant navigate the lease negotiation and space selection process.

Ex-New York Knick Renaldo Balkman has epic meltdown during game in Philippines (video)
Mar 8, 2013, 9:00 AM EDT
Renaldo Balkman had a six-year career in the NBA with the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets, but more notable perhaps was his 2005-06 season at the University of South Carolina. That year he led the Gamecocks to two wins over eventual national champion Florida, and was the NIT Tournament MVP. He was also part of the multi-player trade with the Nuggets that brought Carmelo Anthony to New York.
Released by the Knicks last season, Balkman now plays professionally in the Philippines, although perhaps not for long. In a game between his Petron Blaze Boosters and the Alaska Aces on Friday night, Balkman went sort of nuts while protesting a call to officials..
Petron lost 83-73 to end a five-game win streak. Gotta love the announcers below, who treat the incident like they’re calling a WWE match. “Oh! Hes strangling Ar

Recently Viewed: The Campaign (2012)
A flight attendant navigates the dim cabin. Several passengers—and key members of the flight crew—are suffering from a mysterious illness, and so she desperately (but quietly, to avoid causing a panic) seeks medical aid. She leans across one row and nudges a dozing passenger awake. “Excuse me, sir,” she whispers, “but are you a doctor?”
Cut to the reverse shot, revealing a stone-faced Leslie Nielsen wearing a gigantic stethoscope. “Why, yes, I am,” he replies, completely deadpan.
This, in my opinion, is the funniest moment in the Zucker Brothers’ Airplane. Despite an element of exaggeration, the performers play the scene totally straight, which only underlines the absurdity of the generic disaster movie premise.
The Campaign, a vehicle for the comedic stylings of Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis, works best when it captures this tone—using a pinch of seriousness and semi-plausible situations to lampoon the ridiculousness of modern politics. From the shameless pandering (Ferrell’s character names various demographics, including local farmers and Filipino Tilt-A-Whirl operators, the “backbone of America”) to the dirty debate tactics (Galifianakis at one point dances around a question by accusing Ferrell of dancing around the same question), it certainly captures the flavor of election-time antics—which makes the satirical humor that much sharper.
Sure, the film occasionally strays into Farrelly Bros. territory (dumb gross-out humor)… but gosh darn it if I don’t find the idea of a little boy who wants to fart fairy dust gut-bustingly hilarious.

I tend to freak-out a little when I remember that my belly still has a few months to grow even bigger than it already is. But hey, this thing ain't over until the fat lady screams, right?
There are times when I feel like a second-class citizen in my own body; at the same time, I enjoy feeling so physically in-tune. Every day is a conversation with my body, and I find all the changes, sensations, kicks, cravings, and even the new aches and pains pretty fascinating. It's not always a cakewalk, but I love sharing my body with Baby. Even more, I love assuring Jacob that Baby "told me" she wanted a spoonful of Nutella. Call it the mysterious maternal bond—I know what she likes.
I can honestly say that (so far) I've enjoyed being pregnant. I'm sure there are women out there who will want to smack me just for saying that, but I mean it. Yes, there have been days that were emotionally and physically overwhelming, but the good days have both outnumbered and out-shined them.
Before pregnancy, I expected (and dreaded) that there would be more miseries than joys, and have been pleasantly surprised to find the opposite. Lots of joys mingled with a few endurable miseries.
Of course, I hear the hardest days are still ahead of me... I better not speak too soon.
4 comments:
I love that you always have such a positive attitude about everything! It always encourages me to be better! Love you!
I agree with you: " Lots of joys mingled with a few endurable miseries."
That is how pregnancy and motherhood are. (endurable misery of motherhood = reading Olivia and the missing toy 15+ times a day. I hate that book so much.)
Here is my opinion: If you are a happy person, you will be a happy pregnant person and a happy mother.
i always love your friend's comments! such good thoughts. glad you are feeling well. third trimester is my favorite. i don't think you will have any problems- though it is possible that sleeping will become uncomfortable those last few weeks or days. you look like a maternal goddess :) keep up the good work. i think baby robinson told me to buy the two LARGE containers of nutella at costco last week...she looks after her mom and aunt apparently. or so i'd like to think...
Love the picture. And love your always upbeat attitude. Lot of snow in Prove! Be careful of the ice. You would not want to slip in your condition - or any condition for that matter!

I just sent the answers to most of these but I too have a question:
Who was the first driver to drive a Lola in the race?
If you have the answer George (not me) owes you 20 thousand dollars.

Drivers Still Hate To Lose
The IZOD IndyCar Series seemingly has been immune to a malady that has afflicted many other sports on several levels – indifference. There have been several instances in the NFL this season that have caused fans to question a player’s dedication to their profession. The most noteworthy example played out before a national audience on Monday night a few weeks ago, when Cardinal’s quarterback Derek Anderson was caught on camera laughing it up on the sidelines, while his team was getting bludgeoned by the 49ers.
Closer to home; while no one disputes the talents of Titan’s running back Chris Johnson, his sideline demeanor made it impossible to tell if the Titan’s were in the midst of a six game losing streak or winning streak. Although the Titans exorcised some of their demons yesterday by beating the Texans, Johnson was caught on camera late in the Titans-Texans game three weeks ago clowning around with teammates in the late stages of a 20-0 shutout. The Titans are so bad this year that no one but the two local markets saw the game, but it got mentioned a few times here the following week.
This isn’t limited to professional football. College players have been too willing lately to mug for cameras and lose their game face regardless of which end of the scoreboard they are on. The same goes for college and pro basketball. Don’t get me wrong – I think players should have fun and not be so stoic all the time, but I think that they should act like losing bothers them as much as it bothers their fans.
Although there is plenty of time for clowning around in the IZOD IndyCar Series, the drivers seem to know when to cut the act and get down to business. Scan the faces of the drivers during the singing of the National Anthem prior to the Indianapolis 500. Not many of them look like they are contemplating their next celebration dance.
Which brings me to another rant regarding the NFL…what is it with these pre-game speeches from the most vocal player on the team (Ray Lewis, Drew Brees, etc) that is followed by what sounds like a pack of barking dogs? Talk about contrived – they all seem to wait before the cameras for NFL Films is there before starting their chant. Every team has started to do it within just the past few years. It’s ridiculous sounding. If that ritual motivates anyone, I question their drive. I cannot imagine Scott Dixon leading his crew through a series of chants and responses like that. Anyway, I digress…
This may be one reason why I’m so attracted to racing. All of the participants still take it very seriously. Granted, the consequences of a mistake are much higher in motor sports than in stick and ball sports. If someone gets too careless and misses a blocking assignment, the quarterback might get sacked. The worst outcome is that the team may lose a game or worse yet, the quarterback might sustain an injury.
In the IZOD IndyCar Series – a mistake can cost someone his or her life. Each week, about 1,400 players will participate in an NFL game. Yes, many will be injured – some injuries will be career threatening and life-altering. Very few will sustain life-threatening injuries. The only player fatality in the NFL that I am aware of was in 1971, when Chuck Hughes of the Detroit Lions collapsed on his way back to the huddle and died of a heart attack during a game against the Chicago Bears.
Unfortunately, death will always be a part of racing. Whether or not Randy Bernard and most fans (myself included) get their wish to start pushing for new track records, if you hit the wall in the wrong spot going over 200 mph – the consequences can be deadly. I don’t know if a lot of people realize how lucky Vitor Meira was to come away from his 2009 crash at Indy with “only” a broken back. Had that crash occurred a few years ago before the SAFER barriers were installed (thanks to NASCAR, no doubt), he probably would not have survived.
Although racers will never publicly acknowledge that death ever enters their thought process, the possibility is always there and it probably affects their demeanor prior to a race.
But what about after a race? Fans complain when a driver criticizes her…eh, um…their crew for not doing something right, but in some ways – you can’t blame them. If a crew member forgets to put the right bolt back on correctly, it’s the driver that suffers far worse consequences than the crew member. But it’s not just their own safety that a driver frets about after a race. Drivers still hate to lose.
A couple of weeks ago, I was chastised for saying that Rafa Matos appeared to accept losing. I didn’t say he DID accept it, I said he gave that appearance that he accepted losing. I don’t pretend to know what goes on his head. I’ve never met Rafa Matos. I can only go by the brief glimpses I’m given through television. But from what I saw, Matos never gave the impression that he was terribly bothered by another bad day at the track. There is a fine line between being a good sport and being OK with losing. Of course, it might explain why an announcement is coming later today that will more than likely announce that his seat at de Ferran Dragon is being given to Tony Kanaan.
Some accuse Kanaan of being a brooding pouter. He can be, when he loses or is given an uncompetitive car. Based on the car that Matos was driving the past two seasons, he may be pouting a lot more. But I’ll promise you that Kanaan’s presence will get better performance from that entire team than the nonchalant attitude of Matos.
Some of the older NFL players do seem to care when their team loses. There is no question who won the game when Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is at the podium. It’s the younger generation of players who know that regardless of how they played on Sunday, they’ll still be getting a check on Tuesday. I’m personally glad that Will Power was almost despondent after slapping the wall at Homestead and costing himself the championship. He should have been. Had he gotten out of the car wearing a smile and joking around, I would have questioned his desire and commitment. As a fan, it bothers me that I care more about the outcome of a Titans game than some of the players
Although the IZOD IndyCar Series is on a definite upswing right now, there is no denying that there have been some very serious and legitimate concerns by fans in the past. Some of the previous administration made some very bone-headed moves and the league suffered accordingly. But not once did I ever hear any fans say that they thought the drivers were indifferent about their performance. Winning and losing still matters to them.

I think auto racing is still inherently dangerous in a way that football, basketball, etc., isn’t. Now, there are some hardcore competitors in thaose sports. You don’t find Peyton Manning laughing at a blowout; Kevin Garnett has a white-hot focus on winning.
But honestly, endeavors like the NFL have paled for me in recent years. I don’t like the overhyped, overproduced “entertainment” game it’s become, played by athletes who at times seem apathetic. As I said, there’s great competitors in the NFL, but you notice the Chris Johnson and Derek Anderson cases, you know? Thank goodness I have IndyCar.
December 20, 2010 at 6:56 am
I think–in pro sports–that the competition is still pretty intense when and if the game means something. When the game is meaningless, as many of them are, the intensity falters a bit. Also the money is so huge that they sometimes have to consider the cost/benefit factor. Like–do I really want to go up for that pass on a crossing route in December when my team is out of the playoffs anyway. Racers–Indy and Nascar–seem pretty focused most of the time for the reasons you stated. But there are start and parkers in Nascar and there are non-competitive teams in Indycar who just put down laps.
December 20, 2010 at 7:34 am
Chris Johnson can’t help that his coach has lost the team and his head can stray because of it. As for the pregame pep talk from the captains and coaches, that has always been a part of the game. The cameras know its coming and get to the players to show it because it makes for great TV. We did it in high school and that was a long time ago. As for IndyCar drivers, I wouldn’t pull for one who didn’t want to win. I still follow Tony Stewart in NASCAR because of that trait and it is something I liked about AJ Foyt. I can only follow those that want to win like that.
December 20, 2010 at 7:49 am
I don’t think you barked like animals to the militaristic cadence of one of your leaders when you played high school football. As for Jeff Fisher…he has NOT lost the team.
December 20, 2010 at 2:09 pm
I’ve been around pro athletes of all sports (especially baseball) a lot, and they are all insanely competitive individuals. You have to be in order to get to that level. I had an uncle who was a pro baseball player and played college basketball, and he HATED to lose. I remember him once even talking trash and then getting upset when he lost a game of lawn darts at a family reunion.
Some just don’t show it the way we would like them to, and others reach the point where they are only concerned about themselves (I do think Johnson is a guy who doesn’t care about winning or losing, so long as he gets his carries).
In some sports where the season is so long you have to keep and even keel or it will eat you alive. So those guys go out to win ever game, but at the same time they don’t live or die with it. A baseball player would have to be committed if they did. “That’s baseball” is a phrase I hear a lot from guys because one, they know even in an MVP year they are going to make 400 outs in a year and two, when you win 100 games you still lose two months worth of them, and most of those losses are out of your control.
I think IndyCar drivers have to have a more laser-like focus than other athletes given their margin of error, but to say they care about winning and losing more than other athletes is a broad stroke. That said, what I do like about IndyCar is that EVERY RACE COUNTS. You don’t have the luxury of having a bad day, in many of the ways you mentioned, especially when it comes to the championship. So of course many of these guys are going to take winning and losing very personally, as they well should.
December 20, 2010 at 4:44 pm
Yes there is nothing contrived in racing.
The NASCAR victory lane celebrations. Victory donuts and burnouts. Danica putting on her “show” after someone has wronged her. Paul Tracy playing a WWE character. Kyle Busch doing the same. The Waltrip’s. Digger The Gopher.
Most of these race drivers are from very, very privaledged families and have more money then they could ever spend anyway. And in NASCAR you can make millions of dollars by just running 26th every week and selling a bunch of souvineer crap.
December 21, 2010 at 3:01 pm
Wow, it had been a long time since the last time I strongly disagreed with one of your articles, George.
A few minutes after Castroneves lost the 2010 Edmonton race, he was smiling at the camera. He wasn’t happy at all, yet he wanted people to look at him and feel ok. After all, sport is just another form of entertainment. Drivers and all sportsmen feel bad when they lose, but that shouldn’t forbid them to feel good that they had a nice race / match of the sprot they love to do.

The Oregon League of Conservation Voters endorses Ben Unger for House District 29
Hillsboro, OR—The Oregon League of Conservation Voters has endorsed Ben Unger for State Representative in House District 29.
“Ben Unger is going to be one of Oregon’s next environmental champions, and I’m proud that he’s earned our early endorsement,” said OLCV Executive Director Doug Moore.
“Ben’s commitment to conservation, his dedication to protecting Oregon’s farms and our land, and his emphasis on building a strong local economy based on the area’s agricultural heritage demonstrates that he is the best choice to represent the people of House District 29.”
House District 29 covers Forest Grove, Cornelius, and parts of Hillsboro and Washington County. Both Unger and fellow Democrat Katie Riley are seeking the nomination in the May primary. Katie Riley ran in 2010 and lost to current Representative, Katie Eyre (R).
"I feel lucky to live in one of the few places in the country where communities have come together to protect farmland, open spaces, clean air and clean water. Oregon is a great place to live because it's a beautiful place to live,” Unger said. On receiving OLCV’s endorsement Unger added, “As a legislator, I will fight to protect Oregon - to keep it beautiful and safe. I am proud to have OLCV's endorsement - to me it means that the state's best environmental activists believe I can make a difference in Salem. That's an honor."
Any candidate seeking an OLCV endorsement must first fill out a questionnaire covering a variety of relevant environmental issues. Following review of the questionnaire, OLCV conducts face-to-face interviews with each candidate. When making candidate endorsements, OLCV considers each candidate’s environmental record,, and hold all of our elected officials accountable.

Lot’s Wife Turns to Salt
All she had to do was look straight ahead.
Behind was her home, her possessions, friends and lovers; but ahead was life.
She had her family hand-in-hand fleeing the corrupted city and its destruction. The blessings of the privileged had turned to gluttony, pride and laziness; while the most poor and needy and hurting became the exploited, oppressed and raped.
Just ten righteous individuals might have been enough to stop the destruction, but ten could not be found.
If only Abraham had continued his priestly haggling, he might have understood that it wasn’t fifty righteous or forty or thirty or twenty or even ten for whom God would spare the masses.
It was one.
The righteousness of a single man could be imputed to a world of sinners.
Perhaps it was the cities’ lingering odors that caught her attention. Perhaps it was a forgotten treasure or just a feeling of wistfulness, but all it took was one moment. She looked away from the promise of life ahead for one last glimpse of her past and instantly became a monument to it.

It’s nearly a year ago since I posted about our Dave being after my gin and tonic; but as nothing much has happened in the meantime, I thought that my favourite tipple was safe from the ‘nanny state’: but I was wrong for our
prick Prime Minister now seems to be intent on increasing the price of booze, on the flawed assumption that higher prices will reduce binge drinking.
It would seem that, increasingly, the state has decided that it knows what is best for the ordinary citizens of this country, and that our own opinions are not remotely relevant. Our politicians are, now more than ever, decreeing what is bad for us, and robbing people of the ability to think for themselves. Of course the politicians involved in all these new policies aimed at ‘saving us from ourselves’ never inform us that they are really aimed at raising revenue.
The ‘we know better than you’ mob have come up with another couple of ideas recently … Increase car parking charges to force people to walk and cycle more .. and .. ban fast food outlets, such as fish and chip shops (remember providing smaller salt shakers with finer holes ?), from being opened near to schools: and, as you would expect, some ‘nanny’ bright spark has suggested that those ‘chippies’ already located near schools should sell .. Yes! .. You’ve guessed it .. ”healthy options”!
I bet that the kids in the queue outside Niko’s ’Typhoidopulos Pizza and Fish Bar’ are really looking forward to that, but I can’t see the old doner kebab slicer offering …
… a ‘Fruit and Veggie Combo’ anytime soon !

I was a little too young for Born To Run, in fact I was probably too young for Darkness on the Edge of Town, but as a 16 year old I found it by chance. My friends didn't care. Local radio wasn't buying into the hype at the moment. Not much stirring for a high school kid in 1978 on the Bruce front. Then I got my hands on a copy and things changed. Forever. Before this I was all about Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith (still like 'em too) but hearing this album changed the way I heard music.
I was the classic case of the "teenager". Mad at my father for whatever reason. Not getting along with my step mother. Mad at my mother for divorcing my dad (like he had nothing to do with it). I got over all of this soon enough, but at that particular time in my life I dropped the needle on Badlands and things changed. Here were feelings and thoughts expressed that I had and would continue to have. It's not always a rosy world out there and we need to get through. That and some killer rock & roll. I know these songs are over-played over the years, but they are for a reason. This album is just amazing.
Adam Raised a Cain voiced my feelings about my relationship with my father at the time. It screamed it out of the speakers and while I came to understand him over the years, much like Bruce does on Independence Day (an amazing track off of the River), this one spoke right to me at 16.
Something in the Night and Candy's Room have some screaming guitar and I love 'em both but the highlight comes at the end of side 1...Racing in the Street. What most folks hear as a song about a guy a girl and a car is all about the same redemption that we all seek. The question is will we ever find it. A simply stunning song.
Side 2 is loaded with concert staples: The Promised Land, Prove It All Night and Darkness on the Edge of Town. The first two all full of promise and hope. The latter searching for that chance that we all hope is out there. The battle rages on in each of our lives the question is will life's little victories be enough to get us through.
Even the out-takes, some of which will make The River, and some which don't see the light of day until the Tracks collection are so far above what was out then, or now, that the music continues to amaze me. I love a lot of what he did and I like most of the rest quite a bit, but for me this was the pinnacle of his career. And I keep going back again and again. Searching for that redemption...
Great post, I was too young for born to run, but I loved the Darkness. I had it from the local public Library and had it on tape with Manfred Mann's Watch. Funny how time has slipped away. But I still love both albums.

The first presidential debate held last night focused on the economy, taxes and healthcare. Mitt Romney criticized President Barack Obama by saying the economy has been recovering slowly and has a high unemployment rate, calling into question his record and policies.
Obama said with the economy that he inherited four years ago, his policies are bringing America back from its crisis. While a lot of things were brought up during the debate, including social security, there are some aspects that weren’t mentioned. Obama didn’t discuss Romney’s work at Bain Capital. He also didn’t bring up the governor’s hesitation in releasing more than two years of his tax returns.
Romney discussed his plans of repealing the president’s healthcare plan and talked about his years as governor in Massachusetts when his healthcare plan was implemented. While there weren’t any dramatic moments in the debate, Romney was more aggressive overall.

ymouth Street,February 4, 1793.
Your polite note is so full of kindnesses, that I know not which most to thank you for. That of your promise to fix a day to favour me with your company, and to prevail on Mr Wilson to come also, I prefer. Your brother, the colonel, was enjoying practical gratifications, whilst we were indulging in speculative ones. He was even with us. I am obliged by his card, and am desirous of having the honour of his acquaintance. Alas! I am obliged to go for a few days to Ireland, and to set off on Tuesday next, my brother having particularly desired me to see him in Dublin. Your pamphlet on the Judiciary Establishment is gone to be bound, and it will receive my greatest attention, for, in Asia, courts are much wanted, and good laws. I was reading it, when Colonel Bentham was amusing himself with the Essay on Woman. His Panopticon would, me-thinks, be a good building for a jealous man. The genuine native of Siberia I should behold with eagerness as a rare animal, but mere curiosities, in general, have very little attraction. Cui bono is my question. Your brother is pleased with novelties. Immediately upon my return, I shall claim your promise, and hope that your brother will accompany you.—I remain,” &c.
A Frenchman, named Duquesneau, a shoemaker by trade, had married a servant of Bentham’s. On the 3d February, 1793, a king’s order was issued, banishing the said Duquesneau, and directing him to leave the nation within three days. Bentham took him into his house. The man was supposed, but without any the slightest grounds, to be connected with the republican party in France. Bentham was at this time engaged in his Panopticon negotiations, and was assuredly not likely to obtain favour by interfering on behalf of this poor foreigner. I find in Bentham’s handwriting the following endorsement on the king’s warrant:—
“King’s Order of Banishment to Duquesneau, under the Alien Act,—acting functionary Huskisson, afterwards cabinet minister. The order being groundless, J. B., Q. S. P. [Jeremy Bentham, Queen Square Place] attended at the Alien Office to prove it so to be. Huskisson was haughty and unreasonable, but yielded, though with a bad grace.”
The royal thunder, directed against Monsieur Duquesneau, the shoemaker, was thus spent in vain. This letter of Bentham to Henry Dundas explains the case:—

8th. August 1823
It was set down in my minds calendar to write to you this very day, and forestall your letter. I remained at Dorking till wednesday morning, and deferred writing till I should get to town, and be more able to speak with precision about my Gatcomb movements.
I must first tell you, that I have been at work, and, I think, to good purpose, at Dorking. Last year I did something considerable towards the exposition of all the phenomena classed under the title of Thought.1 I have pursued the subject, during the last few weeks; and all the phenomena called intellectual, (still leaving the moral) have undergone investigation. You know my opinion was, that they might all be expounded upon the principles of Hartley, and might be satisfactorily shewn to be nothing but sensations, and the ideas, the copies of these sensations, combined in groups by association. I think I have now made this satisfactory exposition; that I have not left one point doubtful, or likely to be disputed but by those who lie under the dominion of previous associations, and are not capable of the degree of attention which is necessary to break their fetters. After explaining, in an elementary manner, the phenomena of sensation, and the representations of sensations, the ideas, and also the laws of association, and the artifice of naming, I proceed to apply these elements, and examine how far they go in accounting for all the complicated phenomena, included under the titles, Imagination, Memory, Belief, Judgement, Ratiocination, Abstraction, and so on. No body has seen the papers but John, whose mind however is perfectly ripe to judge of them: and to him the expositions appear to be easy of comprehension, and perfectly satisfactory. I doubt not that they will appear equally so to you. I confess that the evidence has turned out to be shorter, more simple, and conclusive, by far, than I had dared to anticipate. I should like to have your opinion of it; and if I can get it copied, so that you would be able to read it, I will send it to you. The whole is within a very narrow compass; and it will need to be a good deal dilated, and made familiar by illustrations, in writing it afresh for the public. In its present shape, the analysis is given in the naked state in which it presented itself to me, as I advanced step by step.—I mean to go on, next, to the exposition of the Will, and the different phenomena commonly classed under it, the desires, passions, &. c., called the “active Powers of the mind”, by the Scotch and other philosophers. This will be easy; and when this is done, the whole of what we call mind will be explained. I shall then look upon myself as having rendered no small service to the cause of light. I got so full of my subject, that I could not tear myself away from Dorking. There was, however, another reason. For as it is necessary that McCulloch1 and I should so arrange our matters, that one of us shall always be here; and as business came on which rendered it impossible for him to go away at the time which had been originally settled between him and me, that so I might have the half of my holidays now, and the other half to go to Gatcomb with, the latter half of September; I lost nothing by staying at Dorking: for now the time of my getting to Gatcomb will be necessarily postponed for some weeks beyond the time when I hoped I could be with you, and as my stay will also be shortened I shall make my run down to you by my single self. I shall have an ostensible week for you, which I shall make all but two; for I can come off by the night coach on a wednesday evening; and I can be with you all the evening of the next tuesday week. I regret that I shall not see your country in all its beauty; but I come to enjoy yourselves, my own dear friends; and I shall be happy in spite of all the rest. My wife prays me to say every thing to Mrs. Ricardo expressive of her sense of her kindness, in her wishes to see her and girls. With respect to her, however, she hardly proposes to wean her little one1 so soon; and would not be easy at leaving her in the hands of those she has at Dorking. We must look forward to a future time. I beg my own kind regards, and all my gratitude to Mrs. Ricardo. A propos of gratitude, tell her that the turtle came in admirable order, and was a high treat to some friends we had with us from London, who celebrated her health in a bumper. Tell the young ladies not to forget me, nor to let absence deprive me of one jot of their affections: for I cannot consent to lose an atom. Mine, they may be assured, will stand the trial of time.
I am happy to hear that you have been employed upon your proposed Tract: and have no doubt of your proving the merits of your plan.2 Poor Malthus, and his Measure of Value! I am more and more satisfied that your account of the matter, which both Mc.Culloch and myself have adopted, is the true exposition; and that it wants nothing but to be somewhat better expressed than any of us has yet done it, to satisfy every body, except Malthus and Torrens. Mc.Culloch gave me hopes that he would write an article Value in the Suppl. on purpose.3 He also told me that you were to reconsider the subject with your pen in your hand. Why should you despair of putting what you conceive clearly down upon paper clearly? Why despair of doing any thing? Where is that able pen you talk of? I shall try mine upon the subject one of these days. Some one of us three must do it—or it will not be done. Let us all try, and we can adopt the best.
I have been reading the correspondence of Voltaire and D’Alembert, the two last Volumes, in the large collection of Voltaires works. I think it would interest you much. It contains some of the most interesting points of the history of literature at that time in France; one of the most interesting of all the portions of that history—also much information on the state of the human mind, and the instruments by which it was worked upon both for good and for evil—in short I recommend it strongly to your perusal. You will be much entertained, and somewhat edified, by running over a good deal of the works of Voltaire. For elegance and wit, they are almost always delightful; and frequently admirable in tendency.—
Whatever you do, let the consideration of the grand cause be always uppermost. The real principles of good government have you alone, among public men, who thoroughly understand them. You alone therefore can be their real champion.
J. Mill
I must say a word about the poor fishes. I think the error was in not making the pond for the gold and silver darlings, higher up than all the rest. For the spawn of these cormorant fish is so very small that it will make its way through almost any thing through which water will go. The stronger fish, which will be sure to devour the spawn of the weaker, will prevent the favourites from multiplying, I should fear; though they may not consume the grown ones.

Olympic Village provides comfortable sleeping arrangements for athletes under 5-foot-8
Situated in a room that appears to be esthetically plagiarized from a Target billboard, the London Olympic Athletes Village offers two beds measuring 68 inches long for competitors to sleep in.
Yes, within a single collegiate-style dormitory, two top-tier athletes will rest up for an event that will generate billions of dollars in advertising revenue in a bed that many prisons would deem underwhelming. Although to be fair, napping in a twin bed next to your college roommate is usually the time in one’s life when we are able to wake up at 6:00 a.m. and train for elite competition, so perhaps they can channel some of the famous “freshman energy” philosophy majors are known for.
The night stands, however, are actually pretty cool.

HD EndoEYE™ – Recipient of the 2006 SLS Innovations of the Year Award
Orangeburg, N.Y., September 20, 2006 - Olympus, a global leader in designing and delivering advanced and innovative healthcare solutions, was presented with the prestigious SLS Innovations of the Year Award for its revolutionary HD EndoEYE™ video laparoscope at the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons' 15th International Congress and Endo Expo.
The Olympus HD EndoEYE was selected for this award based on its advanced imaging capabilities and the impact that high-definition (HD) imaging can have in the surgical community. The picture quality delivered by HD produces a sharp, smooth, breathtaking image with an amazing level of contrast, detail, and color reproduction when compared to standard definition formats, because of HD’s higher pixel count and density. Consequently the higher resolution is the major advantage of HD for clinical applications because it holds the potential for doctors to improve the precision of diagnosing and treating different conditions.
HD EndoEYE is the only high-definition (HD) video laparoscope that, when combined with the EVIS EXERA II™ HD imaging system, introduces superior HD imaging to the O.R. This unique all-in-one concept is powered by an HD distally mounted video chip, which delivers an impressively high-resolution image that is remarkably life-like. HD EndoEYE is truly revolutionizing traditional laparoscopy by introducing the technological advancements of HD to endoscopic surgery – NOW!

These images are from the first implementation of my backend, where I had accidentally called normalize() on a vector which was almost normalized. The result is pixel-imperfection when compared to the standard ARB2 backend, and the cost of pointless normalization in the fragment shader.
You can also see the importance of running a comparison or image-diff program when implementing a new backend. Can you see the differences between the first two images immediately, with the naked eye? I couldn't.
Finally, here is the backend running the hellhole level. The black regions are areas that would be rendered by the (currently unimplemented in GLSL) heatHaze shader. Not bad for an i965 GPU.
Just for the laughs, here is what happens when Doom 3 decides to try LSD; or fails to pass initialized texture coordinates from the vertex program to the fragment program in the ARB2 backend.
Is it bad that I want to play in something that looks like the image diff? That looks awesome; reminds me of NPR Quake.
I don't know whether it's bad. It might cause a migraine after a few hours. ;-)
However it would not be difficult to implement such a rendering mode. Basically a few lines of GLSL and some very minor (1-2 FPS or less) performance degradation.
Support for OpenGL ES2.0 is also under development, along with a few other development branches. Nothing release worthy yet, though.
I wonder if I can run doom3 on an arm Linux pc? It would be great to run on a pc that uses less than 5 watts unlike any x86 CPU available right now.
Yes, it's trivial to compile for the ARM architecture. However performance will suffer especially on low-power hardware and depending on the GPU available; SGX, for example, seems to have a particularly difficult time with multi-pass renderers.
x86 also has the advantage of having SIMD code already available, although you could implement a NEON backend relatively easily, if you're familiar with ARM NEON assembly programming.
In any case, you're going to be GPU bound rather than CPU bound, and a SIMD backend isn't going to solve that problem.

PHOTOS: Best moments ever on The Hills
Cavallari, 25, welcomed her first child, son Camden, with her fiance, Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, 29, on August 8.
One person not sending her congratulations: Conrad. Though the two briefly reconciled, Conrad, 26, tells Us, "I don't talk to Kristin anymore."

Another former costar not speaking to Conrad? Audrina Patridge."I don't really talk to Lauren or see her at all," Patridge, 27, revealed to Celebuzz last week. "I think there was a little bit of a falling out. We kind of went our separate ways. The show brought us together and without that show, we all kind of go back to our own thing."

But Patridge did say that she'd reunited with former cast members on the small screen somebody. "Give it another year or two years, because then everyone will be established," she said. "I feel like between two years ago and now, everyone is transitioning and figuring it out."

Arturo "Thunder" Gatti
CANASTOTA – There’s no telling what the weather will be like in Canastota next June when the International Boxing Hall of Fame opens its doors to 11 new inductees. One sure thing is that there will be a little “Thunder” in the air.
Two-division champion Arturo “Thunder” Gatti and five-time world champion Virgil “Quicksilver” Hill lead the IBHOF Class of 2013, both being inducted in their first year of eligibility. They are joined by two-time light flyweight champion Myung-Woo Yuh in the modern category. “Let’s get it on,” referee Mills Lane, ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr. and manager Arturo “Cuyo” Hernandez will be inducted as non-participants, while cartoonist Ted Carroll and journalist Colin Hart join the IBHOF as observers. Joe Coburn rounds out the Class of 2013 in the pioneer category.
“We’re extremely excited about the Class of 2013 and very much looking forward to honoring the 24th class of inductees,” said IBHOF executive director Edward Brophy.
The Class of 2013 was announced at the hall Monday.
In addition to the induction of 11 new members, there will also be tributes to Canastota’s own welterweight champion Carmen Basilio, who passed away early last month. The theme of the June 7 event at the Rusty Rail will be “A Night of Welterweight Warriors,” highlighting Basilio and fellow champion from Canastota Billy Backus.
“Carmen Basilio was my sports hero,” said Town of Lenox supervisor Rocky DiVeronica. “We sure will miss him.”
The spirit of Gatti will also be strongly felt throughout the weekend. He was one of boxing’s greatest action fighters, participating in four “Fights of the Year,” throughout his career. “Thunder” won the International Boxing Federation 130-pound belt in 1995, defeating Tracy Harris Patterson. He defended the title three times, including a fifth-round technical knockout of Gabriel Ruelas in 1997’s “Fight of the Year.” He relinquished the belt later in the year to campaign at lightweight. Gatti’s 10-round loss to Ivan Robinson earned “Fight of the Year” in 1998.
Gatti briefly moved to the welterweight division where he beat Oscar De La Hoya with a fifth-round technical knockout before moving to the 140-pound division. There he participated in an epic trilogy with “Irish” Micky Ward, with Gatti taking two of the three bouts. The first and third bouts won “Fight of the Year” in 2002 and 2003 respectively. In 2004 he captured the vacant World Boxing Council junior welterweight crown, which he successfully defended twice. Following a loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr. he boxed three more times, retiring in 2007 with a 40-9 record, with 31 knockouts. Gatti died two years later in Brazil.
“He gave it all in the ring,” said Ward of Gatti. “He gave the fans what they wanted. I’m really happy for Arturo.”
Ward will participate in the Official Enshrinement Ceremony in place of his friend. Continued...
Hill was known for his exceptional hand speed and an excellent jab, and will join his trainers Eddie Futch and Freddie Roach in Canastota. Hill won a middleweight silver medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and turned pro later that year. In 1987 he became Class of 2012 inductee Roach’s first world champion by defeating WBA light heavyweight champion Leslie Stewart with a fourth-round TKO. He defended his title 10 times over four years before losing a 12-round decision to Thomas Hearns. Hill regained the vacant belt from Frank Tate in 1992 and again defended it 10 times. He lost a unification bout to WBO champion Dariusz Michalczewski in 1997, but won a 2000 bout with Fabrice Tiozzo in the first round to earn the WBA cruiserweight crown. He quickly lost the belt to Jean Marc Mormeck, but regained it with a win over Valery Brudov in 2006. After dropping two bouts in 2007 “Quicksilver” hung up the gloves for good, retiring with a 50-7 record and 23 knockouts.
“It’s the biggest honor that’s ever been bestowed upon me,” said Hill. “It’s more than winning the five world titles and the Olympic silver medal. It’s the biggest thing – outside of my children and my wife – that’s ever happened to me. I know this would have meant so much to my father. He passed away a year ago and this was a big thing for him. I’m so happy. You have no idea.”
Yuh becomes the second South Korean enshrined in Canastota, following in 2010 inductee Jung-Koo Chang’s footsteps. He utilized a whirlwind style full of combinations that overwhelmed opponents and earned him the nickname “Sonagi,” which translates to rainfall. The 5-foot-4 Yuh turned pro at 18 and was unbeaten in 36 bouts over nine years. He won the vacant Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation light flyweight championship in 1984 and the WBA light flyweight crown in 1985. He defended his crown a record 17 times over six years, eventually losing to Hiroki Ioka in 1991. It would be the only loss of his career. Yuh won the rematch the following year, defended his crown once and retired in 1993 with a record of 38-1 with 14 knockouts.
“I feel honored and I’m proud as a boxer,” said Yuh.
Lane is only the eighth referee to be inducted, the third in the past four years. The third man in the ring earned a reputation as a no-nonsense referee early in his career. He coined his catchphrase “let’s get it on” late in the 1970s, and it rapidly became a fan favorite. He refereed several controversial bouts, including the rematch between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield, where Tyson famously bit Holyfield’s ear. He retired in 1998 and starred in the syndicated TV show “Judge Mills Lane” through 2001. Lane suffered a stroke in 2002 and continues to recover at his home in Reno.
“Mills was thrilled and appreciative to learn that he was elected into the IBHOF’s Class of 2013,” said his wife Kaye. “He loves boxing. Even more, he loves the boxing community that has been such an important part of his life for over 50 years.”
Meanwhile Lennon is in even rarer air, joining 1997 inductee Joe Humphreys and 2012 inductee Michael Buffer as the third ring announcer in the hall. Following in his father’s footsteps, Lennon has traveled the world as one of boxing’s premier announcers. He announced Buster Douglas’ 1990 upset of Mike Tyson and has been the ring announcer for “SHOWTIME Championship Boxing” since 1991. Lennon’s known for his flawless pronunciation of difficult names, as well as his pre-fight battle call “It’s showtime!”
Hernandez is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers in Mexican boxing history. He guided fellow Hall of Famers Carlos Zarate, Ricardo “Finito” Lopez and Ruben “El Puas” Olivares. Overall, he worked with 12 world champions and 37 Mexican national champions before his death in 1990.
Carroll and Hart compiled over a century of boxing experience between the two of them. Carroll’s artwork could be found in “The Ring” magazine for over 50 years. The famed cartoonist also wrote for the magazine, and his work also appeared in several New York newspapers. Hart began covering boxing in 1964 for London’s Daily Herald, moving to The Sun in 1969. His first assignment in America was the “Fight of the Century,” featuring Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali. He saw a number of other memorable bouts before his retirement in 2000 after 31 years. Hart continues to contribute to The Sun, serving as the paper’s boxing columnist. He won the Nat Fleischer Award for “Excellence in Boxing Journalism” in 2011, the first British writer to do so.
The 24th annual Hall of Fame Weekend is scheduled for June 6-9 in Canastota. Events include the annual golf tournament, Banquet of Champions, ringside lectures, celebrity workouts, a 5K Fun Run, parade and autograph card show. The Official Enshrinement Ceremony will be held on June 9 on the Hall of Fame Museum Grounds. Continued...
Hall of Fame Weekend doesn’t just provide boxing fans a chance to mingle with each other, as well as their heroes. It’s also an economic boon to the area, bringing $2.3 million dollars into Madison, Oneida and Onondaga Counties, according to the executive director of Madison County tourism Jim Walters.

VERONA - Preston Denby's lament after his Vernon-Verona-Sherrill's girls basketball team lost to Whitesboro 60-37 was predictable.
And accurate.
"It would have been a helluva game if we scored in the first quarter," the veteran Red Devils coach said. "We couldn't make shots."
VVS (5-12) did during the next two quarters as it played the Section III power evenly, but it was too little and too late.
"They're a good team, but we missed too many shots," Denby said.
Jennifer Deuel led the visitors with 21 points and had a hand in many of the plays that led to Whitesboro being ahead 15-0 after eight minutes. Maria Lapertosa and Jessica Scott also scored in double figures for the winners while Codie Bayeur was VVS' lone girl to do that and had 14.
Whitesboro 15 15 11 19 - 60
VVS 0 16 11 10 - 37
Whitesboro: Jennifer Deuel 21, Maria Lapertosa 11, Jessica Scott 10, Kaylee Gassner 6, Lindsay Roberts 4, Alyssa Trad 4, Alexis Delahunt 2, Lauren Lapertosa 2.
VVS (5-12): Codie Bayeur 14, Paige Zupan 4, Clara Richardson 6, Therese Pitman 9, Kaitlyn Reader 2, Laura Strobel 2.

This story broke my heart. I hope Etta will visit us at and we will ship any order she places for free. We are proud to be "fake" and we are proud that our daughters are learning the value of money and resisting the evils of commercialism and superiority complexes.
The American Girl stylist should be ashamed of herself, as should every mother in line who made snide comments to your daughter. I hope that Etta understands that there is NOTHING wrong with her or her dolls, and that the problem lies solely in the need for people with small minds and screwed-up priorities to make themselves feel superior at the expense of a six-year-old.
Honestly this is just horrible. If it had been my daughter, and other mothers would have made ugly comments they would have either gotten spit in the face or punched.
I cannot believe that. I would have totally been having a few words with those other "mothers".
I am just plain disgusted. Being a "daddy" of a 4 year old - I could not have held my tongue - especially to the other haughty women in line. Good job for holding it together.
The word I am looking for is "appalled." I cannot believe that this happened; every aspect of this story blows my mind - the rudeness, the haughty responses, the latent sarcasm. And all directed at a child!
I hope your daughter feels better (I'd assume she does, since she sounds quite bright), and I hope that the American Girl people might eventually come to their senses and issue a genuine and heartfelt apology, as they should.
Oh, how horrible for Etta, and for you! This hurts both my grown-up self and the little girl inside who had fake Cabbage Patch dolls with home-made paper and ribbon outfits. I'm so sorry your daughter learned such an ugly and unnecessary lesson. If those snotty mothers were any kind of mothers at all, they would have backed Etta up instead of trashing her in front of their children.
i am the daddy of a 2 year old (almost 3) and i am about to cry reading this. my daughter does not have an american girl doll and now she never will. hopefully word gets out (already has, i picked this up on the consumerist)
nowhere on the website for the salon is it stated that the doll has to be an AG doll, only that it is your 'child's favorite' doll. i wonder if their refusal to style etta's baby constitutes fraud? the website is deceptive at best.
I read this and almost cried. How anyone could treat a little girl this way is beyond me. Karma has a wonderful way of making things right.
I hope that store gets what is coming to them.
I am insulted that American Girl did this, That's even less class than Macy's has!!!
My heart broke reading this. My favorite doll growing up was a no-name, but it never mattered to me -- kids shouldn't be concerned with the pedigree of their favorite toy. How can someone who works with children and dolls for a living be so thoughtless and cruel?
how awful. beautiful child, beautiful doll vs. ugly behavior. thank you for holding it together for you and etta.
is there a gracie legal defense fund? it sounds like a defamation of character case.
Oh man... Just read this on Consumerist.com. I'm at work right now and I'm trying not to cry.
This is reprehensible, detestable, and about 800 other horrible things. I can't even imagine the pain your little Etta must have felt and is probably still feeling. I used to work as a camp counsellor, and helping kids to build their self-esteem is one of the greatest things an adult can do. An "adult" who aids in breaking them down deserves to be shot.
Let's hope this spreads (I'll be putting it on my blog) and this "stylist" gets what's coming to her.
The whole time I was growing up, I really, really wanted an American Girl doll, but I never was able to save up enough for one.
After reading this, I'm glad they never got my money. Pfft! And if I ever have any daughters, they won't be getting their money, either! Ridiculous.
Unbelievable! Even though Etta's "fake" doll is not as expensive as those from American Girl, $29.99 is in NO way cheap for a 6 yr old!
I can't believe the treatment Etta received, by both the stylist and the Moms in line. If I'd been one of those Moms, I'd have been taking my daughter home after seeing the stylist treat a child that way!! Give Etta a hug for me!
How awful. Lucky for you, you've made it onto Consumerist now, and I think you're going to get the apology you so rightfully deserve, along with a freakin' TRUNK full of American Girl dolls.
I know it's got to be difficult to explain to a six year old that the problem isn't her, or her hard won doll. My heart goes out to Etta.
Having two girls, a four year old and a three year old, I was having to look at the possibility of having these American Girl Dolls very soon. The lesson I'd rather have them learning is the one you taught her, the value of earning something. I can guarantee you that this line of dolls will never have a place in my home or their grandparents home.
Wow...that's just so sad. As a girl, I had two American Girl dolls, Molly and Samantha, before they got bought out by Mattel. I was even part of an American Girl fashion show.
This is just so wrong. Who are these people that need to make themselves feel superior to a SIX YEAR OLD? Pathetic. Makes you wonder who the real children were in that situation. So sad that the playground antics were coming from the mothers themselves.
This American Girl concept is really silly. The only thing American about it is convincing peple to spend twice as much as they need to on an idential product because it has a cool logo. Don't be one of the drones that buy into this nonsense.
Etta's already smarter than these people who ganged up (against a six-year-old) to hurt her feelings. And it sounds like she has an awesome mom to help her get through this. I'm just sorry she had to learn the hard way that some people get everything they want without working for it. Tell her she's got a great heart.
Well! That real $20 could have bought a real hair-do for Etta's dolly from a REAL hairdresser....
When I read this story, I started to cry. Last year, my daughter attended an American Girl Birthday Party where she brought along her Target doll. Our daughter actually had a "real" American Girl doll at the time of the party. However, we had originally bought her the Target doll when I was in school and couldn't afford a "real" doll. She chose to take the Target doll to the party, instead of the American Girl doll, because it was her 1st and favorite doll. Two other, older girls chided her at the party for not having a "real" doll with her. She cried in the car on the way home. As someone who became interested in the dolls because of the books, and the great, inspirational stories, I am very disappointed by the culture the dolls have created among girls. It appears as if the company who sells these dolls and the parents who have purchased them, have forgotten the value the brand was built upon. As a consumer who spent over $400 in the American Girl Place Store in Chicago last week, it will be very difficult for me to ever spend any money in the store again. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to your daughter and hope that you will receive an apology from American Girl directly.
OMFG that's hilarious! I can understand the hairdresser acting like a retard, but the women in line... do people really act like that after the get out of middle school???
Bummer for your daughter, but she probably learned a valuable lesson about what sort of people she should avoid.
Dear Etta,
Those mean ladies were completely WRONG.
Your doll is BETTER than American Girl dolls. Your doll was meant for a great big girl like you to love. Alll American Girl dolls were meant to was to make a big, rich company even richer.
The mean ladies are like some of the kids in your class calling other kids nasty names. I think that grown-ups should know better, don't you? I bet that you do.
Find something nice for yourself on the Emily Rose website. That is a company that knows that dolls are for loving and playing, not about whose stuff is better.
I bet that Mommy can help you find someone to fix your doll's hair...and it will be NICER than some mean old lady at an American Girl store can do.
Love,
Sara's Mom
p.s. Sara doesn't have those dumb dolls either.
Congratulations to Etta - she has a mother who cares. I feel bad for the other little girls in line whose mother's are teaching them to be petty, insensitive and consumer-driven. If I had been there with my daughter, we would have turned on our heels and left (but not before letting them know how we felt). I can even understand if they couldn't be as elaborate in the hairstyle - there may be legitimate differences. But, they could have done something. I usually run the American Girl Fashion Show for my charitable organization - we may need to reconsider.
Just posting to let you know the Consumerist.com story got posted on reddit.com (and I am sure Digg soon), so you should get plenty of attention and hopefully a response from that store.
Reading this made me want to throw up. That poor little girl.
Call 310-252-2000, ask for Ellen Brothers - the Executive Vice president of American Girl Brands (owned by Mattel). Tell them what kind of mean people they have working for them and that this is probably not the kind of image they should want to present.
Well, I just logged onto the American Girl website and told them to remove the "American" from their name, as it implies a belief that all men are created equal. It just took a few seconds of my time, so I hope you all do the same. Let this company know how much business they just lost!
That poor little girl! If I wasn't already appalled at the prices this place charges for the privelege of owning one of their dolls, this definitely convinced me no daughter of mine will ever go near one of their boutiques. I can't believe none of the stylist's coworkers did anything when Etta was crying. :( For shame!
This is a hard time to be raising children and I commend you. I don't think I'll ever be able to do it. I hope Etta looks back on this someday and sees that as terrible as the experience was, she was lucky to have the mom she has, and not one of those rich harpies from the line.
Up on Digg now, too:
Until I see some significant display of remorse and retribution from Mattel, I will be informing AG resellers in my area that the brand is not push-worthy, and leaving them with a good explanation as to why.
Etta, you are a sweet girl with a good mom, and because of this, you will not end up like the harpies in the store, attempting to make up for failed lives and empty marriages by being elitist, looking for affection from plastic people and teaching their daughters just what the future holds for them as well.
This makes me sick. I don't have any daughters, but I have two son's. If they had been treated like that, I would have knocked a few heads in.
I will be happy to send my two sons over there to knock around some of the snobby moms. Hey, their big kids.
Give me a break. I think the company did the right thing. If you buy a fake doll, what do you think the company is going to do. Good for them. Either spend the money next time on the real deal or if you bought from Target why not just do the dolls hair at home and be true to the dolls own roots
Ugh.
Some people think I'm elitist for shopping at Target and would roll eyes at spending $29.99 on a doll.
But that's not the point. The point is that the hair stylist was unforgivably rude as were those other moms in line. If AG has some good reason for not styling other doll's hair, it would have been nice to have had it explained in a nicer way.
I generally like AG products. However, I never have liked rude people. It's too bad that this hair stylist was the face of AG; it's just hard to separate the two for me now.
When AG comes calling to suck up, as they most certainly will now that this story has been Dugg and Reddit'd, I hope Etta will turn up her nose and refuse the bribes they are sure to offer, because she's a REAL American girl, with a REAL doll, and AG is just not good enough for her.
I gave the store a call and asked them about this situation. They response I got was heartening. I was immediately put on hold and put in touch with the store manager- not a customer service rep or operator. She stated that they had another call about it and had forwarded it to corporate. She, also, told me that they were looking for the story (I refered her to the consumerist) and invited Etta's mother to call them so they could make this right.
The reason they don't style other manufacturer's doll's hair is for fear of damaging it. This make sense. However, yelling at a 6 yo does not.
I think Etta's mother should call. They might just make it right... who knows, maybe Etta will get the lesson that sticking up for yourself is a good thing as opposed to learnig to be a victim.
Some parts of your story are so uplifting, and I hope you will reinforce to Etta these good things - despite the hideously behaved women in line and the clearly power starved-stylist who did this to your little girl. Here are some great things that stand out:
(1) Your little girl earned her own money, and she is only six years old! How clever and industrious she is!
(2) Etta BOUGHT HER OWN doll! How proud she should be!
That actually makes her doll far more "real" than the other girl's dolls.
(3) Etta has an extra-special relationship with her doll, because she CHOSE her as the doll she would love and protect! Other mothers and other girls don't understand her special bond with Gracie, and they never will.
(4) Gracie STILL needs Etta's love.
Gracie even needs Etta's protection from people who are ignorant. That is what good doll mother's do.
You love Etta even though those people were mean to her. Etta can love her doll, and help her doll understand that sometimes...other people are stupid.
It is OKAY to still love Gracie!
(5) Etta TAUGHT HERSELF TO READ! Hooray for Etta! That means she is a very clever girl.
It is SO much better to be CLEVER than to be RICH!!!!!
(6) Poor stupid, ignorant people in line who don't know any better! Even though Etta is only six, perhaps she is clever enough to understand that those women in line, and the stylist, are not very smart.
(7) Etta seems to be a wonderful and charming little girl. There is a lot to be proud of in how you've raised Etta.
Can I make a suggestion?
You can help her retain her self-esteem and reinforce the solid values you've been teaching her.
Over the next few years, introduce her to the following books (when age appropriate):
I) The Velveteen Rabbit
Age: Now
A stuffed rabbit was not loved because it was too old and worn out. But then, when it was loved anyway, IT BECAME REAL.
This is PERFECT for your daughter, right now.
II) The Little Princess
Age: 7 or 8
A little girl is good, pleasant and honest even as she is treated badly by those around her after her father goes away. She's also smart. She doesn't do anything she feels would be wrong to herself or others, and stays true to her own values.
It's a great story about retaining your integrity, even when those around you have lost there's. (I think there is also a doll in this story.)
III) The Wolves of Willoughby Chase
age: 7 or 8
This is a book about two little girls who use their wits to outsmart all the evil rich people around them and save their own lives. It's scary, but great!
IV) Little House on the Prairie
Age: 8-9
Remember Nelly Olson??? And how Laura was the good one, while Nellie and her mom were conniving, money grubbing freaks. Perfect for teaching Etta she can be her best self, and no one has the right to make her feel bad about it.
V) Nancy Drew Books - either the new or the old series
Age: 9 - 10
Nancy rocks! She solves mysteries and kicks butt. She's a good person. She shows girls that being clever and smart allows you to think beyond those around you and that thinking for yourself is a worthy endeavor and the least you owe yourself.
It sounds like you're a really great mom. It makes me feel horrible to imagine how you felt when you found out what happened. Keep up the good work. Etta may encounter self esteem challenges, but she's lucky to have you there fighting for her.
Oh my goodness...that's heartbreaking. How can people be so horrible!
I'm not surprised, really. just disappointed. That stylist should be ashamed of herself. And those other mothers? WOW. They really must have low self esteem to make themselves feel good by putting down a child.. PS Shame on the poster who called the hairdresser a "retard" Talk about being childish & ignorant!!
I grew up admiring other girls' American Girl dolls. However, my mother was very smart (Master's degree in child development) and very caring, so she never wasted money on dolls. She bought me beautiful dolls, but not American Girl dolls.
Now, I am a mother of a nine-month-old girl. Thank you for sharing this story with us, the parents of the world. Companies that don't know how to treat human beings should not get our money.
Disgusting. I hope AG sends over some free product and Etta accepts it to donate to children not nearly as lucky as she is. I'd bet the local women's shelter could put some AG stuff to good use.
I'm so sorry this happened. This is such a horrible story. I'm just really so.. I can't believe this happened. I'm so sorry and I wish there was something I could do.
This story made me very sad.
I'm kinda curious how you have a word for word account of the other mothers' comments. Was your 6 year old taking notes?
I don't really see anything wrong with a company choosing to service its own products and not others. If you bought a fake Coach purse, do you think a Coach store would embroider your initials on it for you?
I feel bad for your daughter that she had an experience like this, but I don't really agree with your reaction.
This is absolutely disgusting, and a horrible example of how low our society's mentality has come. Thank you for sharing this with the online community, as it will make people aware of this and will let them know not to go here.
I hope your PageRank shoots through the roof and whenever people Google for "American Girl Place," they find your post first.
People these days have no manners and no class. Rationalize all you like about fake Coach bags and whatnot, but this just impoliteness for no good reason whatsoever. And to a 6 year old girl? Come again?
I just went through my daughter's book collection and threw them away. I told my daughter at Christmas I wouldn't buy her an American Girl doll. They were ridiculously priced. Neither of my girls will have those books anymore. They can read Little House on the Prairie books if they want, but there is no way I would support that company after reading this garbage. Sorry, but I am afraid I may have popped one of those mother's in their cosmetically altered noses if it had been my daughter. Guess I am not as sophisticated as those NY ladies.
They don't style other doll's hair for fear of damaging it? Bullshit. It's DOLL HAIR. And honestly, how hard woould it have been to take the$20 and put a bow in Gracie's hair or something to make a six year old happy? Especially when she started crying. I have a two year old girl and that breaks my heart. We're also trying to raise her to be non-materialistic and this is the kind of stuff I fear. So much crap out there now trying to get our kids to buy, buy, buy.
Etta sounds better than 9 million American Girl dolls. Poor baby. Those other moms should be shot, too.
Rationalize? Pointing out the obvious fact that not only *can* companies choose to only service their own products but that most do is rationalizing?
Why does nobody here want to call Etta's mom on the fact that she had to know she was sending her daughter into a potentially bad situation. At the very least, she couldn't bother to call and verify that they would service any doll in their proprietary doll store? I certainly would have done that for my daughter.
The feeling I get from this letter is that its unlikely a 6 year old - while she "cried and cried and cried" - was taking a whole lot of notice of what was being said to her. I have to wonder if Etta's mom isn't taking some poetic license.
It's also a little tough to believe that in an entire group of mothers - women who have and love children - not one would have shown even an ounce of sympathy for a distraught 6 year old girl. Let alone have several actually pounce on a bawling child.
My take - Etta's mom feels bad for not being able to protect her daughter from a dissapointment and she's trumping up the story to create hostility where there was none.
I feel bad for the kid - really I do. Maybe I'm just one of those worrier moms, but I would have called to make certain they would do it for non-American Girl dolls. After all, she's going to the American Girl store where they sell American Girl dolls (for large sums of money). Maybe Mom should have anticipated that something could have gone wrong and double-checked. I would have.
This is so sad and breaks my heart. The other mothers there should be ashamed of themselves. Some values they are teaching their kids. My hats off to you for teaching Etta whats really important. These other mothers and the people at the salon make me sick.
I promised my stepdaughter she could get an American Girl doll and one outfit for her birthday this year. She has been into these dolls for a few years now and is very excited about her birthday present. I'm not going to break my promise, but after that, we're done. I'm sorry that Etta and her mother had this bad experience. And regardless of whether or not AG Place is justified in their policies, whatever...in this case, it's a crappy company policy, and I don't need to give any more money to a store with a crappy company policy.
That's terrible....I would have told that sylist exactly where to go....
funny in this age of social networking how a poor brand experience can snowball. hope they make amends to you and your daughter.
When I was nine, I saved all my money for a year to by an AG doll. We lived on the west coast, far from any hairstyling experience, but I recived a doll hair care kit from a loving aunt. After I washed my AG doll's hair with it, I was silly enough to try to do the same thing with my barbies. The hair clumped up and the only solution was to have a bunch of butch barbies. The AG employee probably should have been more sensitive, but imagine how horrible it would have been to have Etta's favorite doll ruined.
This story is a good example of how two wrongs don't make a right.
Etta's Mom: Please, you seem bright, but surely you had the sense to expect that the AG event was for AG dolls. Maybe they were doing it to market to non-AG customers, I don't know, but a reasonable person would have called to make sure. Lastly, your story lacks some detail which, to me, makes me wonder how honest it is versus an emotional reaction to a bad experience.
Hair Stylist: For the love of g*d, you know you are working with children for the day. Couldn't you have been a bit more respectful? OK, I'll buy off on the idea you don't want to service the doll because it isn't an AG product or some fear that you might damage it. I tend to be blunt and insenstive, but even I would have gone with:
My! I've never seen a doll like this. Her hair is so different from what I am used to working with. I don't want to ruin your friend's hair, so how about I just put in this bow to make it a little prettier.
And then NOT take the $20.
AG: You stage an event for children yet [apparently] hire people that are not capable of dealing properly with them. Shame on you! You should have a list of action items coming from this experience, including but not limited to:
1. Make sure events have appropriate staff.
2. Make sure events CLEARLY state what is and is not allowed
3. Damage control. Find this girl, make it right. By right means an apology and letting the family know what you are going to do to make sure this doesn't happen to anybody else.
4. PUBLICALLY respond with the same. Admit your errors, show your remorse, correct the problem, let everyone know how you corrected the problem.
I would imagine that her friends mom related what the other mothers said to her.
While i can appreciate the AG might not want to style the hair of other "none-AG" dolls, there is still no excuse for how rude the people were to the little girl or for everyone elses comments.
It's terrible that those people were so heartless towards your daughter. I'll never understand how people can be cruel to children, especially at a place that's designed for them. American Girl has been ridiculously overpriced forever, and only snooty obnoxious girls ever had them when I was a kid. Your Etta is better off without any of those pretentious dolls anyway!
(Read this on The Consumerist)
How awful for your daughter (and you!) to experience! I hope their response is timely and apologetic.
The other mothers in line that "tsk tsk'd" should be ashamed of themselves.
Unfortunately, this is a lesson that kids get to learn over and over again growing up.
I have two wondergirls, ages 6 and 8. They both have American Girl dolls and accessories, which are very nice, but very expensive. Their mother (my ex) and her family have this have to have the best of everything attitude. What is wrong with Barbie or something similar? The conduct of the stylist was reprehensible to say the least. My oldest daughter would have let her have it and I wouldn't have said a word. I'm questioning why anyone would have brought a third party product in there anyway unless they advertise it that way.
3 of my daughters have AG dolls. In fact they have multiple ones. Their grandmothers love them and buy them mostly. My daughters love their dolls and honestly, all of the Bitty babies are very worn and well-loved.
This story broke my heart and I hope Etta has recovered from it and is feeling proud of her doll. She has every right.
I would encourage you to help your child though stand up for herself by standing up for her. Talk to AG if they approach you - allow them to try to make amends. Why? Because it teaches her that she deserves/derserved better and it teaches her that her mother isn't closed minded.
Even though I wouldn't want anything AG in my home after this, I still think AG should send this little girl a doll and TONS of expensive accessories as a way to say they're sorry. Then her REAL doll (the Target one) would have a friend to play with.
Was any effort made by Mom to contact the store? My experience, as an uncle of an AG fan, is that they have impeccable Customer Service...but to get it sometimes you have to speak to a manager. It should have been adressed with management by her friend on the spot. Sounds like Mom is reacting to hearsay - I find it hard to believe all the direct quotes from the Mom when there was no mention of the hairstylists name (bet they didn't get that important detail!)-and Mom wasn't even there!
Why bash AG because they are expensive? It's a wholesome product I'm willing to pay for because of the great educational/historical content AND their great customer service.
AG would have better been served by the Mom or her friend working immediately and directly with AG in New York to rectify this together rather than whining about it hereand prolonging the poor experience of her daughter. Besides, if the associate was rude or curt, they could have addressed her performance in the store by now. Be a more responsible parent, Mom, and partner directly for solutions - especially when your little girl's feelings are at stake! I'm sure AG would take your complaint seriously (especially if you can recall the rude associates name)
Heartbreaking story.
But, thank you for sharing it on the internet. This will make a big impact on the company. It was mentioned on Digg.com , and has gotten alot of attention. Thank you
I do think they are nice dolls, if horribly overpriced. I would never spend that much on ANY toy.
I am heartbroken for your daughter and I hope the stylist was fired and that you are pursuing this story with the company and the media.
The only tiny excuse I can find for them is that if their dolls really are high quality and they are using heat or something to do the hair they might damage other brands. But that in no way excuses the way she was treated. If that's the case it should be very clearly noted in the store, on the party contracts, in the invitations.
That just sucks.
Oh how awful. I remember spending hours as a little girl sifting through the American Girl catalogue daydreaming about owning a Felicity doll, but my family could never afford to get me one. I think that I turned out to be a pretty balanced woman! I remember the other girls being very elitist about their AG dolls... I will link to your blog on mine.
Hey Anonymous,
Perhaps the mother doesn't know your name, I mean, the stylist's name.
Instead of standing behind AG like a blind automaton and blaming the mother or the child (you suck) perhaps you should send a little empathy their way.
This kind of thing happens all the time, everywhere. It's bound to when you wrap up so much importance on the price of something.
This kind of thing should be brought to light, it's unacceptable for people to behave this way. It's far from whining you pompous ass.
Besides, I doubt AG and their customer service could heal the scar on this poor kid's self-esteem.
Coming here, saying what you said...you're throwing gas on the fire. Good job dumbass.
Wholesome product? They sure hire really rude people to promote this 'Wholesome' product. Anyone ever have manners in this snotty business of doll hair stylists?
I suggest you all boycott this place. They will pretty much do everything to get your attention due to the bad press that this will bring up.
20$ buys a lot of better things than a doll haircut in Target. I bet someone here can do a better job than those stylists.
As someone who has 9 American Girl dolls and who has had nothing but EXCELLENT customer service, I wonder if the stylist simply refused to style the doll's hair because she was afraid of damaging it.
That said, she should have said it in a nicer way. And just brushed it and put a bow on it for free.
I went to American Girl Place Chicago last year and was treated very well. They made a vegetarian platter just for me and even comped a meal when they were out of an item. I had an extremely pleasant experience to say the least.
Please do not penalize American Girl for what the other moms said- or for what one unprofessional stylist did.
Hi Horrible mom. I just read this story, and would be glad to send your daughter a soccer ball. Doll are overrated--especially the overpriced American girls. As the father of an 11 year old girl, I'm proud that my girl would rather play sports than dolls. Contact me and I'll have a ball shipped from amazon.
I laughed when i read this.
HAHAHHAHAHA
Just canceled a decent sized order from AG. I MAY reorder if that "hairstylist" gets canned and AG more than makes up for it with the little girl.
BTW, can you really be uppity if you style doll's hair for a living??
I have no children or dolls for that matter but this is reprehensible. But then again, its not even the "rich culture," that perpetuates these ideas. In the adult world, this is no different than women who expect (or nearly demand) "real" diamonds or a diamond at all for their engagement rings. Sure, many will say the size doesn't matter, and to some it may not, but nearly all women want a "real" diamond. Because a "fake" one (though chemically identical) is somehow less valuable. Those little girls, the ones that buy the cheap dolls or the expensive name brand ones, all get brainwashed later by Debeers. I'm sure all the women deploring this treatment of a child are hypocrtis when is comes to themselves. "Fake" diamonds are like having a cash bar at a wedding, no matter what the reason, people are going to call you cheap behind your back. Cheers ladies!
I just updated the external links on the American Girl page on wikipedia. See here:
Mark me down as someone that will think twice before I take my daughter there again. We live in Highland Park, IL not too from Chicago. I have spent about $500 in their store downtown for different items and events for my 4 year old daughter. The entire episode makes my skin crawl and I really don't think I can ever go back there again. This is not the lesson I would want my daughter to take away and had I been in line I would have left with you!
I hope someone from the company sees the damage this has done. It's pathetic.
I sent a email to corporate over my disgust of their treatment. I hope they make amends or that this story diminishes business for unexcusable actions.
Heidi - As someone who owns 9 absurdly overpriced dolls that were made in China (along with the "fake dolls"), I'm not sure you are qualified to criticise.
Speaking as the dad of a newborn girl, I will never, ever spend a dime at American Girl.
This is just reprehensible.
They don't deserve your business!
If the stores policy is not to work on non-branded dolls, then so be it. But to harangue and insult a little girl is sub-human. She should be fired and blacklisted.
Perhaps someone should remind that woman that her job is STYLING DOLL HAIR and that is about the most useless thing a person can do on this planet.
mailto:service@americangirl.com
the stores service email we should all email this link to tell thier employees are pieces of shit
my mother and dad were REAL hairstylists and though are both deceased, my mother would have fixed that little dolls hair like it was going to a hairshow. and if she did indeed damage it, she would have bought her another, WHY you ask would she have replaced it? because unlike AG, she knew children were worth EVERYTHING and our worlds most precious gift.
more than a mere commodity to extract funds from, or to build your business on by offering "snotty" dolls for RICH people.
I'm the father of a little girl and I'm blown away by what Etta experienced. That's just appalling.
I will never buy one of these dolls for my daughter, and I will make sure that I let the company know this.
Wow...just wow....
This story is too perfectly sad to not get picked up by all the news media next week. But now I am afraid for my own daughter's.
@ anonymous
You were probably one of the selfish idiots standing in line spouting ignorant comments!
2007 Real Girl of the Year Award
American Girl is looking for everyday girls who are just as caring and compassionate as our Girl of the Year, Nicki. If your daughter’s brightest moments are achieved when helping others in ways both big and small, we want to hear about it!
Your daughter is heads and shoulders above whoever they pick.
I think you should enter just to get your story seen by someone in the company
I've seen AG products and have thought about purchasing them for my children and will not. I do not want to partake in this kind of culture where a doll is a status symbol by the very virtue of its name.
Dear Etta,
Your mommy seems really clever and smart, so I'm sure you are too. That's why, when you grow up, you will have a much more important and glamorous job than "doll hair stylist," and you will be able to buy as many American Girl dolls as you want.
But you probably won't want any - because, do you want to know a secret? American Girl dolls are not that great! Do you know why they have hair stylists for them? It's because their hair gets tangled all the time! And also, you can't cuddle with them!
Emma, my favorite doll, is not an American Girl doll, even though I had some of those when I was a little girl. Emma is MUCH more special, just like your Gracie. And Emma is here in my bedroom - but my old American Girl dolls are in a box in the basement.
Etta, you're going to be a great young lady one day, and when that happens, I hope you still have Gracie in your bedroom - she's a keeper!
:)
I hate American Doll. I have heard that their dolls leak toxic chemicals from the plastic and some little girls are getting sick but they pay off the parents - this is bound to come out now.
If AG thinks Etta's doll is "not real" they are delusional.
I will never let my daughters shop there. Ever!
PLEASE enter your story at the American Girl 2007 Real Girl of the Year award...
To everybody talking about how this is a crappy company policy:
Wouldn't you all also be angry if the stylist had styled the doll's hair, and it had, say, fallen out as a result? AG doesn't know how these dolls are made, so they can't be certain that they won't damage the dolls by styling them. It's not a crappy company policy.
To the stylist:
I understand that you may have been having a bad day, but you are being paid partly to be nice to children. Plus, handling this incident the way you did was just plain mean. No cookies for you.
To the author of the original post:
You don't mention going to the management. Personally, I think you should have- what if the stylist was mistaken, for instance? Even if she wasn't, they should have been able to explain the reason for their policy and possibly comfort your daughter in the process.
we have 2 of these "real" dolls sitting in the closet - they were gasp - hand me downs from my little sister to my daughters. Guess what? they cant play with them because they are ridiculously expensive and if they destroy them my sister will cry.. now i feel like giving them to my dogs to bury in the back yard.
I wish i was there to beat down every single one of those vicious customers that felt the need to make it a more horrible and embarrassing experience. Shame on every one of those rotten women
I very much feel for Etta, and hope she realizes that worth comes not from the money one has or the objects one is able to buy, but from one's ability to love, to be kind, and to respect the beauty in life. Material possessions come and go, but quality of heart will never desert you.
To all those who left comments such as -"You wouldn't expect Coach to embroider a fake purse", etc..You are missing the point. Adults choose "fake" name brands as a status symbol, to appear more affluent than they are. (The way people buy name brands like LV, Coach, etc.. simply because they want people to know they have money)--From the description of how the mothers in the AG store behaved they fall in that category.
Etta did not choose her doll in order to adhere to any falsely set standard of affluence. She chose her doll because it was special to her. She earned her money, chose her doll, and that doll was greatly loved.
What the stylist did was intolerable. Anyone can braid a doll's hair and put in a few ribbons without damaging the doll. Anyone who can't should be prevented from having any job that requires the use of their hands. Furthermore, it is not the stylist's place or that of the other mothers to chide or deride that child.
One rude blogger asked if the daughter was "taking notes", and implied the mother was lying. Any child who is treated in such a way will for a long time remember word for word what people say at the time. Children have remarkable memories for what adults say in normal situations. (We've all encountered situations where a little one accurately repeats a statement made by a parent at an inopportune or embarassing time)
For those mothers of children with American Girl dolls- Your daughter could probably care less about Mattel or the AG company. Your daughter's concern is HER doll. Once it was taken out of the store, it ceased to be American Girl ---, it became Cindy, Mandy, etc...
Above all, it is important to do what is right.
My mother's favorite doll was a large baby doll that my grandfather won in a crane game. That doll was loved by me as well as all my cousins, and is now being loved by by nieces and nephews although she is much worn.
I always say I am going to write a letter when I see a story like this, but never do. This one got me so fired up, I just sent an e-mail to Amercian Girl. That "stylist", and I use that term loosely, should be ashamed of herself. Please tell Etta that there are people out here reading her story that care and we are making our voices heard. I would say they should give her a free doll, but who wants that American Girl trash anyway! I can say for sure that my daughter will never get an American Girl doll from her Dad.
PS(I'm the one who said "Wouldn't you all also be angry if the stylist had styled the doll's hair, and it had, say, fallen out as a result?", etc)-).
By the way, for what it's worth, unless Etta's mother told her what the women in line were saying, I highly doubt she even heard. Children who are 'crying and crying and crying' tend to be oblivious to things like that, I've found. Not that this makes what they said any more acceptable (Assuming it wasn't exaggerated), but I'm just throwing that out.
i can understand how this would be upsetting. however, manufacturers tend to promote their own 'boutique' (brands and people pay extra money for them) because there's an exclusivity and sense of worth (or self-importance). often times there are even actual qualitative differences.
if you brought your ford to a ferrari mechanic you'd get the same reaction. if you brought your mutt to a shitzu dog show you'd be received the same way.
maybe the website was misleading...but did anyone else bring a cheap knock-off doll to the american girl."
Well said. Let's remember that they are, afterall, just dolls to the kids. There are children out there who think themselves of less worth because they can't afford even the "fake" $29.99 doll. It's not about the doll. It's about the grown-up behaving badly. And I've had grown-ups behave badly and give me rotten customer service in Wal-Mart, Target, and the Dollar Store. There is enough snotty, snooty, and crappy behavior to go around in every socio-economic level. Been to a Wal-Mart lately and watch how many parents hit their kids? The wealthy folk don't have the corner on that market by a loooonnnngg shot. If I were going to not patronize a store just because I had one bad customer service at some point or because some of their clientel behaved badly, I'd have nowhere to shop but my corner grocery store.

Wow...
As a 27 year old man planning for fatherhood in the near future I suddenly realize that I'm way out of touch.
I still can't quite wrap my head around the concept of a "fake doll". I have to put in quotes because it feels so absurd.
Be glad this lesson happened so early for your daughter. I'd imagine most non-comforming or worse yet, poor people don't realize how many people judge and qualify other human beings by their brand value until Junior High School.
That is just terrible. How could anyone do that to a kid? I cannot believe what snobs that women and those mothers were.
Tell Etta that what makes a doll real is how much it's loved, not how much it costs. And she can proudly say she earned the doll herself, rather than just have it handed to her.
)."
Yes. Please please people. Throwing away your children's toys and books to prove a point is just as cruel if not worse than what that stylist did. Don't give that one woman's one bad deed so much power. Good lord.
This broke my heart!!! I cannot believe grown women (And MOTHERS) acted like that! My husband told me about this blog entry and I just had to read it for myself. (he was just as upset as I was!)
I have a 4 year old daughter and she hasn't discovered American Girl dolls yet, But she will NOT have one now! I'll be buying from "emily rose customer care" for her generosity!
I create custom Boutique clothing for girlie girls, and I would be so glad to send Etta a free twirly skirt. My DD Loves them! Just visit my website and click "contact us" to the left and let me know her favorite color combos and the size she needs!

To Jennifer, Heidi, and others showing us the other side of the story, thank you. From what I've seen, the American Girl is only supposed to style American Girl dolls because the hair is different. The "Barbie" anecdote seemed to confirm this.
To everyone finding it easy to hate and who are atacking American Girl, owners of American Girl Dolls, customers of the salon (not the "rude" ones; just the normal ones), people with money and/or people who live in NY's Upper East Side: OK, I see your point a bit. THe hair stylist was pretty insensitive to the girl (assuming Etta's Mom got everything right) and the mopthers were misbehaving (again, assuming everything was reported accurately, etc. However, be careful you don't turn into elitists, too. Not that you are, but one doesn't need money to be a snob or elitist. One is also an elitist of they automatically assume they're better than those with money. Just keep that in mind.
Thank you for the time you sacrificed in order to read this comment. It is much appreciated..
Oh my god. This is insane. Those other moms should be slapped, or something equally painful that doesn't teach violence.
I had no idea those stupid dolls had a background of "inspirational" stories attached to them.
Screw it, they should all be slapped. This is disgusting.
I hope Etta learns from this that in life some people are mean, and that what mean people say is not always correct, and certainly not worth listening to.
American Doll sucks and if I ever have a daughter, or a son who likes dolls, they will never get one red cent of my money.
Just disgusting.

How can this possibly be bad?
I think I know...
Little girls don't understand or give a damn about branding without mommy's influence.
These AG dolls aren't marketed to the girls, they're marketed to the mommies. Mommies who project themselves onto their daughters.
A media backlash would be bad because it would hurt mommy to see her Pre-K give up AG doll on principle through that amazing innocent clarity of child.
As a result, mommy with her talent for projection will then project her own shame (at being in at least one way, less mature than her child) into anger...Anger at the people who share her daughter's clarity.
Sad.
."
The world is a lot bigger than this blog, lighten up.
Just think how much time and energy YOU wasted by reading and replying to this silly, possibly fake story about a doll when you could have been fighting against real injustice, pedophiles and muderers.
Better get going.
Snobbery in the dollhouse? Wow! Consumerism has taken us to a new low. Affulence and decadence is such a wonderful combination. Reading the comments such as the one from Anonymous (March 23, 2007 9:42 PM) makes me want to puke.
"These AG dolls aren't marketed to the girls, they're marketed to the mommies."
Who are we kidding? Of course products are marketed to children. I haven't heard of half the kids crap out there until my kids saw it on commercial televsion at one of their friends' houses or heard about it from other kids at school.
If American Girl wasn't so big a deal to this mom and little girl, then why such a big deal over buying the fake to begin with? You can buy even less expensive dolls. Heck, you can MAKE your own dolls with a bit of fabric, needle and thread and the kids can love them just as much. There are plenty of gently-loved used dolls out there every Saturday during yard-sale season. And where I come from Target is just as much a brand name as American Girl or Mattel or Barbie or Waldorf.
It's just a doll, no matter the cost or name brand. And just a doll who needed a $20 hairstyle. Puh. Lease. Any lessons about "real" and "fake" and value and ethically spending money were blown for me right there. $20!!!!!!?

For all we know this is exactly what she did say. The mother wasn't even there!! She didn't hear what was said. It's sad I went back & read a couple of the blogs earlier posts, she talks about being bored by her kids & ignoring them . And in this supposed incidence she wasn't with the child. I tend to want to hear the other side of this. I doubt we heard the WHOLE truth!
Something I find rather ironic about the whole thing is that American Girl was the title of the magazine for Girl Scouts of America more than 40 years ago.
How is this kind of behavior going to teach our daughters any kind of worthy lesson? It doesn't teach value. It doesn't teach kindness. It most certainly doesn't even teach good manners, which seem to be in very short supply these days.
This is a perfect example of how so many companies have no clue when it comes to customer service. Etta was a customer, and was treated most shabbily, as if she didn't belong in the establishment. She was ridiculed, humiliated, and worst of all, sent away without the service she came for.
A smart stylist not only would have performed the style, but would have taken note that Gracie was not an actual, factual "American Girl" doll, and through creative (read: sneaky) conversation with Etta, would determine that cost was the issue. A quick call to her manager would procure a coupon for 20% off on any AM doll of her choice. (A guess -- I used to work at a retail store, and could give 10% off on anything on my own initiative, calling the item "damaged". More required a manager.)
This story is enough of a tear jerker that any manager would be an idiot if he didn't see the opportunity, not just to get the $20 for a style, but another price for a new doll. Etta was a golden opportunity -- the retail equivalent of the kitten with a hurt paw -- and these idiots kicked her instead of cuddling her! All it would have taken was a little incentive, a coupon, a little good treatment, and Etta and her Mom would not only have been happy with Gracie's hairstyle, but perhaps happy AM customers for life.
But no...they couldn't just be unhelpful. They had to be unhelpful snobs. Now Etta's Mom wouldn't touch an AM product while wearing a space-suit.
I feel for Etta -- she was treated horribly. I think the company deserves anything that comes to it for being so galactically stupid as to allow such a lapse of customer service to occur. The customer isn't always right...but the customer is always the one paying the bills. And THAT means you look for ways to make the situation right -- every time -- or someone else will.
Second and Third everyone's comments about this is horrible.
I got the American Girl (AG makes me think Alberto Gonzalez) dolls right around when they first came out. My grandmother "bought" (she was elderly so I'm pretty sure my mom organized the "purchase") Kirsten for me.
I loved the books (my mom's family is 100% swedish so her books connected on many levels), used the St. Lucia costume-kids version to dress up for St. Lucia day, named my first cat (and eventually the second cat) after Kirsten's Missy.
I got Samantha and Molly as well (Molly esp. because my mom was growing up around Molly's time period). I loved these dolls so much and learned so much from them and the other products surrounding them.
I still think that the dolls are useful and fun. Living in Chicago, I went to the American Girl store. It was quite impressive but I also realized that only the original dolls (or all the historical dolls) had any value to them. The top two floors full of "modern day" clothing and the salons... silly and frivolous.
If and when I have a child, I'll most likely buy her Kirsten. The other newer stuff... nah. I like what one person said in a comment... as soon as the doll leaves the store it's not an American Girl doll anymore. It's the child's.
And yeah... I find myself defending the dolls a lil' bit more than I'd like. Wish the company hadn't become retarded and conivingly enterprising.
This makes me sick to my stomach. I cannot believe how rude these people were to Etta. I'll tell you one thing, when my daughter is old enough she won't be getting an American Girl doll.
I just placed a substantial order with American Girl and am considering calling back and placing another!! You people are nuts!!
Confronted with a similar situation, I would find it nearly impossible not to point out to this "stylist," who refused to do my child's doll's hair, that she was, in fact, doing dolls' hair!! It's unfathomable to me that anyone would make an issue out of where the doll came from! But particularly a doll hair stylist!
Growing up, my daughter was not one of the kids with money. To say we had very little would be putting it mildly. She did get an AG doll, though. She wanted one SO badly, so her father and I saved for months. She got that doll for Christmas, and she was SO happy. She loved and adored that doll for years.
I believe this story. The reason I do is because American Girl put on a tea party at the local country club. My daughter wanted to go, begged to go, and nearly exploded with happiness when I said yes. We went, and honestly, the women there made me ill. I was there to have fun with my daughter. We dressed up and she insisted on wearing an Easter bonnet... and she and I had fun. But the obnoxiousness of the women in that room stuck with me for quite awhile. The AG Crowd are elitists.
My daughter is 17 now, and even though she may have a good Coach collection, and doesn't feel 'less than' when it comes to money any longer - she still took time to donate her AG Doll and clothing to a child she happened to know of who wouldn’t be able to get one of her own.
Poor little Etta. I echo the 'broken heart' sentiments. It’s simply unthinkable for someone to treat a child that way..

Well said. About the first sensble post I've read regarding this. I'm so appalled @ the "Adults" calling names, etc. You're no better than the stylist, If this actually occured.
Nordstrom's will tailor clothes, even if you don't purchase your clothes there. You have to pay for it, but they will accept clothes from other merchandisers. I don't understand why this establishment would refuse business b/c the doll was a different brand. . . I always thought American Dolls were scary looking anyway. (I also don't think it is appropriate to use the term "retard".)
I'm not familiar with Nordstom's tailoring regulations...but our local department store "leases out " the tailoring...not actually owned by the store...so perhaps that would have something to do with it. Our society has become so sue happy...I understand companies erring on the side of caution. Especially we a young girls beloved doll. I agree though that I'm not 100% comfortable that this took place as described.
After my initial shock, disgust and heartbreak, I thought of this: The other girls in line all had pretty much the same doll. Sure they had different hair, eyes, clothes etc. but the were the same. The only really special, individual doll in the WHOLE place was Gracie. I'd rather be one of a kind than one of the crowd and I hope Gracie agrees ;)
I hope your little girl is feeling better. It's hard to explain that level of meanness to anyone, much less a child.
This 6 year old will never forget this, and I sincerely hope that she goes on to great success in her future life at the expense of these neuveaux riches bigots. An absolute disgrace..
My heart aches for your poor little girl. I have emailed AG and told them I am appalled that their representative would be so cruel to a child, and that they can expect no business from me or many of the parents who were linked to your blog from our parenting board.
I would like to suggest a storybook that might bring some small comfort to Etta: "The Best Loved Doll" by Rebecca Caudill.
Dear Etta,
You are so big and smart. You learned to read by yourself?! I have 4 little girls that always wanted an American girl doll, but just like you they would have to give up all their presents for Christmas and birthday to get just one for the four of them to share. They decided that one doll for all four to share wasn't really worth it, just like you thought it was too much.
My daughter Danilla bought a baby from her own money she earned by raising chickens. My other daughter Precious bought a Barbie from the money she got for her birthday. Santa brought Lucy a little bitty baby and Aukxsona a baby that drinks a bottle. They don't have "real" dolls either. You see, they are smart like you...they know those "real" dolls aren't worth so much money they couldn't each have a doll. They also know that those dolls are just the same as all the dolls they got or bought on their own. The only difference is the name. So don't worry Etta, lots of little girls have dolls that aren't "real" according to the hair stylist. Just because the one lady said it wasn't real, doesn't make her right.
If you ask any of my little girls if their dolls were "real" they would say YES! They love their dolls because they are special to them. The hair stylist was too old to see how special your baby was to you. Only another little girl with a special doll like yours could understand. So Etta, remember your doll IS real. More real because you saved the money to pick her all by yourself. Also, remember that lots of little girls have real dolls just like you all over America...and these are what REAL American dolls are...dolls for REAL American children that are special just like you. Bless you Dody are.
I'm not getting this. Why do people need to put down the other little girl's beloved dolls to make "Gracie" and Etta feel better? These are also innocent children with their very special dolls. Why this "my doll is better than yours because it's more fake or more real or expensive or not as hoity-toity or made with organic whole-grain flax or whatever"?
This is so typical of our society: Build ourselves up by putting others down. Not playing nice, people. And not a way to teach anyone self-worth. "I'm bettter because you're worse."
I have never been so enraged over a children's doll before. This is absolutely disgusting...
I can't even imagine an adult doing such a thing to an innocent child like that. It's one thing if that the stores policy strictly enforces rules against (I refuse to say "Fake") dolls other than American Girl, but it's another thing for her to literally throw it back in your daughters face and ruin something she cherished. I am truly disgusted, and simply cannot believe people like that can live with themselves.
I can only say that I have great respect for you to leave those !@#$* mothers standing.
Dear Etta
I do not know you but I am very proud of you! Using your own money for a special doll. YOur doll is " real " because you love her. This should not have happened to you or any other little girl. You hold your head high and go on loving your doll.
To Etta's mom
You must be very proud of your daughter, how happy the both of you must have been at Target when she paid for her special doll all by herself. I do not know how to help her broken heart but I think you will find a way.
How sad are world is these days. Give your daughters an extra hug for all of us who do not know her but are proud of her.
I'm very sorry to read about your Etta's experience at the American Girl Place, and I wish there were some sort of goodies I could send her like the ones some of the retailers have been offering. I will be e-mailing the company, though, as a one-time customer appalled at their lack of appropriate customer service.
I do, however, encourage Etta to stay strong and tap into her creativity when playing dolls. Since my family couldn't afford all the expensive outfits and accessories for my Molly doll (which I was VERY lucky to have at all) my mother instead taught me to sew, and together we made her dresses and pajamas. I also used to make Molly food and accessories out of clay. I'm in college now, but I still enjoy making doll outfits and designing my own dolls. Right now I'm making a lot of Greek mythology characters out of Barbies, but later this year one of my friends and I have plans to make Beth and Amy from Little Women out of some of Gracie's cousins.
I feel the American Girl company, especially since it got bought out by Mattel, has placed less and less of an emphasis on history and creativity over time. In Meet Samantha, the first American Girl book I ever read, Samantha gives up her nice, new doll to her friend Nellie, a disadvantaged girl who works as a maid for Samantha's neighbors. If Mattel is going to market these dolls based on the values present in the books, they should perhaps read the books first.
Etta, you and Gracie are beautiful and you know that is the truth. Those ladies who told you that Gracie wasn't good enough only like to have money. They don't know how you feel, because you love Gracie. Now, you saved up for Gracie and were you proud of yourself when you had enough money to buy her at the store? Do you remember how you felt when you walked out of the store with her in the bag, all yours?
That's what makes you and Gracie beautiful. Nobody else should care where you bought her or about anything else. All that matters is how much love you have in your heart for Gracie, and the things that you two do together.
Please don't let some mean old ladies who don't know how to be friends take away your love for Gracie. You worked hard to get her and you know what? YOU know what she likes best, not someone at a store who can't see how pretty Gracie can be! You and mom are the ones who know the best way to fix Gracie's hair because you will use LOVE, and that's what makes you look more beautiful than anything Etta!
Have you read the Velveteen Rabbit? You made Gracie real too, sweetie, and only you know how real she is.
I hope a bunch of irate Moms (preferably accompanied by Target and other "not real" dolls) go to AG Place tomorrow and let them know they cannot treat people this way. AG owes Etta big time and I hope they will make this right with her, but even if they do offer Etta a doll and a bunch of clothing (as well they should!) I hope Gracie will continue to be Etta's favorite.
AG if you are reading this, I think you need to extend a special invitation to Etta and her doll Gracie to spend a day at AG place and see the show and have the lunch and whole works - on your dime! You need to make this right!
I said the dolls were not real American dolls because fewer than a quarter of the population could afford such dolls and thus do not represent American children as a whole like Target or Wal Mart dolls do which fully 85 percent of the population could afford. It is statistics maam... nothing against the children...just statistics.
Well once again the power of the media rules. This will cost them some business. I think a formal apology is the least they can do.
To the folks who keep saying things like "don't throw away your kids' AG toys" and "stop ganging up on AG," you need to get a grip.
Customers vote with their pocketbooks.
There is a lesson to be learned here - and AG needs to learn it.
In the current age of economic outsourcing and off-shore production, the quality of most products is pretty comparable. It's the BRAND that makes the difference. It's the BRAND that makes the prices vary.
I can choose to buy any of a hundred brands of great tasting coffee - but I will choose the brand that is also fair trade harvested.
If I'm going to buy a doll made in china - btw, the AG doll and the Target doll are both made in china - I'll choose the brand of made-in-china-doll that doesn't treat its customers like crap, thankyouverymuch.
If you care sooooo much about all those kids out there that you don't even know having the chance to love their AG dolls - you should be out there buying AG dolls for every kid in the country! Why aren't you trying to get the right to own an AG doll added to the constitution?
Seriously people, it's ludicrous that you would actually bother to implore people on a message board to go easy on AG.
I guess you'll just have to buy more AG stuff to make up for the business they are going to lose from this point forward.
There are plenty of places I can spend my money, and my kids will be a LOT happier with dolls that come from a company with a track record of upstanding behavior and GOOD SOLID CUSTOMER SERVICE.
And you know what? I'm going to tell my kids WHY we don't buy AG dolls. Hope my kids don't happen to mention that to your kids...oh - wait, that's what you're worried about, isn't it.
Ah, well it's all clear now, I see.
Stop telling me to support a company that obviously doesn't bother to train its employees to handle a situation that I'm sure has come up before.
And if you've got a "hunch" the story on this blog isn't 100% accurate - so what? It's a BLOG, not the New York Times.
The gist is they treated a little kid like crap, and they are a TOY company.
That's enough for me to know that I should take my business somewhere else.
Sorry if that makes you feel threatened for some reason.
The Target dolls that I see - the Our Generation dolls listed right now - are all white dolls. Hardly representative of most American children. At least American Girl has diversity going for it beyond just white, whiter and whitest.
And I'm sorry, but if you think that 85% of American children can afford $29.99 for one doll, you need to get out more. Because not the kids I hang around with and not many of the kids in our school district. And this family owns three of them? $90 on dolls is exorbitant no matter how you slice it when there are kids in our schools who don't have books or pencils.
39% of children in the US live in low income families.
18% live in poor families.
33% of African American children under the age of 18 live in poverty.
For many kids I work with, spending $29.99 on one doll would be all they get for Christmas and their birthday and Easter combined. So again, not all of America can afford the fake dolls. Not 85% by a long shot.
Just wait until the children in the Brazilian favelas hear what we're paying for Target dolls and hear us complaining about our children's tender self esteem being crushed during a consumer experience. Poor, poor us.
Oh please.
An employee at Target once spit on my friend's kid's head.
Don't shop at Target anymore.
A Wal Mart employee once called another firend a bitch in front of her kids
Don't shop at Wal Mart anymore.
The fair trade coffee we buy is shippped thousands of miles at an environmental cost of thousands of gallons of oil all so we can feel good about helping out some farmer in Central America.
If you think there isn't a company out there who isn't raping its customers, plundering the earth's resources, and treating employees like crap at one time or another, I have a bridge to sell you.
AG's customer service track record has been pretty darn good as far as I've read about previously. I'd say it's just as likely a case of 6yo dramatics and mom's insecurities as anything else.
Hi folks, I don't think this story is so touching because it has to do with money or consumerism or corporations. It's about jerks being mean to a little kid. F them.
To the people who keep saying that they doubt what the other mothers said..
Etta may not remember what they said if she was upset, however - Etta's mom states quite clearly that Etta was with her friends mom.
I'm quite sure that her friends Mom heard and remembered all the nasty comments and passed them on to Ettas mom.
Another point to make. Any retailer will tell their staff that they represent the company they work for at all times. In the eyes of the public and customers of AG, that one idiot stylist may as well be the whole Company.
By doing what she did, that stylist has damaged her employers reputation by failing to do her job and represent what that company is about - Pleasing children with Toys that they love.
So what if the doll was a fake, she should have smiled, told Etta what a lovely doll it was and then braided its hair and put a ribbon in it.
I think our whole country needs to get both sides of a story before they start on their war path. The worst things that have happened to me in my personal life have happened because people went around running their mouths instead of talking to ME, the person it involved. Given a chance, most times, we humans can learn a lot from putting our hostilities on hold while we TRY to set an example for our children and COMMUNICATE. I am sure there would have been a way to work this out if someone wasn't waiting to be offended. How can we expect our kids to work out disagreements or express their hurt and try to make amends or offer insight if they don't see it modeled. Some terrible things in history (much worse than commercialism or just ONE child's feelings) have been assaulted because people don't give each other a chance. In the least, don't hold the company responsible for an employee's actions until the company backs up her nasty behavior. Our world would be much better for our children, dolls or no dolls, if all of us tried a little harder to give each other a chance. My opinion on the price of AG dolls isn't even relevant here, like it or not, if this is a true, unadulterated story, it is about the lack of understanding and compassion on a stylist's part, backed up by ALL the other moms in line, AND the readiness of all many to take offense. All the bloggers who threaten and insult others are not much better than the original offenders. My first response was pure sadness for Etta, my second was disgust at the willingness of the public to incriminate and detest others with zero representation from the other side. I am not defending the gross error on the part of the stylist, but everyone should step back and ask for accountability and explanation. Would you want your business slandered because you had an employe who mistreated a customer? Given the same situation, I would have told my daughter sometimes there are rules that we have to follow, even if they don't make sense. I would have hugged her and told her we would have our own hairstyling party. I wouldn't further encourage the stylist, walked away with my head held high. I then would have gone directly to the manager or CS dept and explained what just took place. I would be willing to bet that even if that is their policy, they would have required an apology right then from the stylist and done something else to make Etta feel welcome there. If not, THEN I would have created a stir for AG, not before. THis is a great example of how rumors begin wars.
I've just emailed American Girl suggesting that if they do not correct the situation properly with Etta, that I will pay for a press release to be distributed by PR Newswire (goes to all the major news media and wire services) about the situation.
Assuming that the front line customer service person reading the email actually bounces it up to someone who matters, that, along with the other emails and calls already sent, will probably do the job.
This is appalling. Not only does the "stylist" need to be fired or dramatically retrained, the store manager needs some serious help, because even having an employee that would perform that poorly in an environment where children are being served reflects badly on the manager as well as the employees.
I didn't say 85 % of kids could afford a 29.99 dollar doll, I said 85% of kids could afford a doll from Target or Walmart. Also, race was not even brought up. So if you quote me, please do so properly and don't throw straw man arguments. The original blog was about snobbery, money, and the price of it all..
Blah blah blah, BURN THE DOLLS/DON'T BURN THE DOLLS!11
How about we forget about the stupid dolls (ALL of them) and turn our children towards something with a little bit less gender-bias? A nice, big stuffed animal can encourage a love of animals/nature instead of creating this negative, elitist attitude that is begotten from the very act of the purchase: "My doll is superior because it HAS A BRAND NAME and it cost $100 and IT BELONGS HERE {at the AG Place}!" at six becomes "I'm worthy only if I have money to afford {for example, those hideously overpriced Coach bags that some of you lovelies have brought up in the above}! Anything less is unacceptable!" at sixteen. Stuffed animals, particularly cool ones, foster a truly human-hierarchy-free level of love and compassion.
People gave me dolls when I was young, but I hated them. I just didn't like dolls. I didn't like the idea of some inanimate--but humanoid--object with lifelike looking eyes staring at me. It gave me the creeps.
But a nice, fat, fluffy stuffed animal/stuffed plushie? Especially in my house, where my parents were allergic to real animals, they were more than welcome to fill up my room. I adored them, and find myself desperately wishing that back when I was young they'd have the things that kids have available to them today (animals, aliens, cute monsters...today's kid has such a wealth of things to choose from).
Anyway. If I were that kid and I received a doll (or two) from the company who did that to me, I would name the doll after the wenchbag who made me cry and then cut off all of her hair. Then take her back to the AG salon and ask the same hairstylist if she can fix herself.
Nice blog, I'm reading this from the other side of the world from you, but still feel the hurt.
I can believe some mothers acting like the ones in line did, too. Can you imagine what they're teaching their kids at home, makes me shudder.
I got curious and read the website of AG. We don't have it here of course - and I feel extremey grateful for that after reading this and looking at the pompous industry it has created.
How awful for you and your daughter. I hope all the comments left on your blog reaffirm your faith in humanity. I just wish I had the wisdom to suggest something that would help your little girl forget the whole ugly mess ever happened.
dude i dont even like kids and i think thats really really REALLY f'ed up.
even me... kid hating ME would never destroy a kid like that. thats just... f'ed up! that person should be fired immediatly to say the least...

Many little black girls choose to buy white dolls over black dolls because our society has reinforced the message to little black girls over the past 200 years that white is beautiful and good and powerful and black is not.
Google "white doll black doll" for a quick education.
"The original blog was about snobbery, money, and the price of it all."
Exactly. This is exactly what people buy into when they purchase any product which reflects our society's skewed sensibilities and rampant consumerism, even a Dollar Store knock-off Barbie with her panoply of accessories and Glamour good looks.
Shame on any doll for spending $20 on a hair-do. How is that not also about snobbery, money and the price of it all? How can anyone say "Here's $20 to do my doll's hair" and then complain about snobbery?
Does anyone not see the irony there?
I feel very, very bad for this little girl. She went into this unwittingly and got an unfortunate education.
But that's what happens when pretty and "bling" is what everyone aspires to in this country. Until people overwhelmingly use their purchasing power to buy "chubby, gap-toothed, frizzy-haired Matilda who comes with co-op hemp-woven accessories and a commuter rail pass" then even Dollar Store Barbie is part of the problem.
Yikes, stay away from this brand, and not just because of this story.
I went to their website, and what a crock - dolls don't teach "values" or "educate" parents do.
Gessh, and I thought it was bad when I was a kid, but just the fact that a place exists for over-priviliged children to have a doll's hair "styled" in the first place (for more than most normal people pay for a HUMAN haircut) is scary and sad.
Take the money you'd spend on these crazy, useless products and do something good with it besides reenforcing the consumer culture that leads to "Stupid Spoiled Whore" syndrome.
I bet Paris Hilton was a huge American Girl customer - do you want your kids to turn out like THAT?
Hello annon: ALL coffee is shipped thousands of miles at environmental cost. (Is your coffee grown in Georgia or something.) So if the choice is fair trade or rape and pillage - I'll choose the fair trade brand.
Maybe I'll choose not to purchase coffee at all. Maybe I'll not buy dolls or "fake" products that trade on AG's name or product development..
EEK! Etta's mom, you rock! And I love your writing! AG is sooooooooo in trouble with me.
I feel bad for the way the little girl was treated if this story is true. I also feel the mother should be ashamed of herself if this story is true. One of the core parts of being a parent is protecting and raising your child properly. This mother knew she was going to a name brad event with a non name brand doll. Simple logic would probably tell you that it wasn't going to to work out. The mother should have called and asked the question before she even talked to the daughter about going to the event.
This story doesn't really have that ring of truth to me. I don't believe it actually happened. Not in the way the original poster is posting it anyways. If you notice the mother never has any direct comments with the stylist and the other mothers in line. Does that make any sense? That she would just stand by why her daughter presents the doll and gets yelled at by a AG stylist? I believe the original poster is just somebody that had a bad attitude and didn't get what they want so they changed the story to suit there own needs. Or maybe this never actually happened. The original poster left so many holes in the story it just looks like someone throwing a pity party to see how much damage a bogus story could cause a company.
I have a radio show in Lincoln, Nebraska about computers and technoloigy and your story would be a PERFECT example of how the Internet can be used to warn others about bad service experiences. We would LOVE to have you on one of our shows. Call me at 402-212-5393 and we will put you on live. Our show airs Saturdays from 10-11 AM (CST). You can listen live on. I will put you on today if you can call in the next hour. This is a horrible experience that no little girl should ever have to go through again.
That is perhaps the most insensitive thing i have heard. Those people obviously know nothing about children & have no business working with them. I hope that the store really takes a look at themselves & their business practises. I work with children & it is part of my job to lift them up, give them confidence & respect! That just really sucks, I would never buy one of those dolls for a little girl they are overpriced & stupid. I feel really sorry for your daughter. I guess she learned a valuable lesson on how people can be very insensitive & cruel.
From what I read the mother wasn't there. Her daughter was with a friend and her friend's mom. I'm wondering how the friend's mom stood up for Etta. Because if the answer is "a little" or "not at all" then maybe its time for new friends too.
"Rationalize? Pointing out the obvious fact that not only *can* companies choose to only service their own products but that most do is rationalizing?"
Um maybe the company should have specified on their ads/website that only AG dolls would be 'serviced' at this event.
Since they didn't, it's no surprise that this kid went to the event thinking that her "fake" doll would get a new hairstyle.
Either way, we're talking about little kids, here. That stylist totally made an ass out of herself by demeaning a friggin 6 year old.
Ridiculous
wow, 167 comments! good to know people are reading. like another commenter here, i was also the girl with the "fake" cabbage patch dolls and all the snobbish results that incurred when i took my completely handmade "fake" cabbage patch doll (i named her "Penelope") to a slumber party. it wasn't until years later when the cost had dropped so far down they were offering them at grocery stores that i got my own "preemie" - i was nearly a teenager at that point.
Etta will one day realize from this experience, thankfully, that she doesn't need a pair of $200 jeans to look good. She'll have a lot more money to travel and spend on materials to make things and do really great things in life while all those other girls are mincing around in overpriced shoes and handbags. hang in there, little etta. and in the meantime, go get some scissors and give your doll a punk-rock haircut.
"If you notice the mother never has any direct comments with the stylist and the other mothers in line. Does that make any sense?"
Um, yeah... it makes perfect sense because the mother wasn't there.
Perhaps you need to improve your reading comprehension skills before you try commenting on a blog post again.
Your point is pretty much cancelled out since you didn't read the original post correctly.
D-minus for effort. Move along please.
When I was younger I was insanely jealous of my stupid friends with those stupid dolls where even a stupid pillowcase for a stupid bed costs a stupid amount of money.
American Girl Dolls are wonderful-- they're wonderfully expensive.
It's sad that even children are aware of brand images. And if you're not, you'll get yelled at for bringing a less-expensive doll into a ridiculous tourist and consumerist trap.
I hope Etta's happy now that she's a minor celebrity!
My family, including my daughter who turns 10 on Monday, is traveling to NYC in a few weeks. The AG Place was on our itinerary. Not anymore. And after my daughter reads why, I won't be surprised if she cuts off all of her AG doll's hair.
{{{{{{{{Etta}}}}}}}}
As a mom of a 6 y/o daughter, I am appalled to see how your little girl was treated. :*( I have been boycotting AG for awhile for religious reasons, this gives me even more reasons to not spend my hard-earned money on their overpriced products. When I was a child my favorite doll was from K-Mart--I see nothing wrong with Etta loving her Target doll and wanting to have fun with her. Shameshameshame on that store and those other mean mothers for treating Etta the way they did. >:-( I'll add a link to this on my blog too.
It could also be that it didn't happen this way at all. That the stylist was professional and kind in giving the information, but that the child threw a tantrum and the friend's mom had to doctor the story to save face.
Innocent until proven guilty and not by 6yo hearsay.
This is such a fake story. I can't believe the majority is falling for this bogus story. The original poster most likely doesn't even have children.
All of you that are bashing American Girl should be ashamed of yourselfs not the American Girl Doll company. Try to get some facts before reacting instead of buying into this silly stuff.

"That's all ?????" You've got to be kidding.
Talk about a pity party. If you can't find a way make it up to this little girl, perhaps you can get your manager in on the act.
Boo-hoo that you are working as a doll hair stylist and chose to make yourself feel momentarily better by crushing the feelings of a six year old girl dressed in thrift store fashions with a doll she bought with her own money.
If you are who you say you are -- you should have been ESPECIALLY nice to the little girl with the not quite brand name doll.
And this pathetic "apologies all around" is not really going to do the trick.
Perhaps you need to get in touch with the child, explain that you were having a really bad day, tell her of course her doll is "real" and actually quite beautiful, and that you'd love to do her doll's hair.
Or at the very least get your manager to send the girl a gift certificate and ask for a chance to make it right. If you aren't up to fixing the doll's hair, take the day off and let someone else do it.
Really sorry that your life as a doll hairstylist sucks - but come on. You spend the day indoors, in NY, in a cushy neighborhood and a posh store. It's not like you're in the Peace Corps.
My sister died in a car accident at the age of 26 while working in Mozambique teaching african teens about reproductive health care and how to avoid contracting aids.
She was no stranger to high end shopping.
But she was able to put her designer clothes and bags aside for the almost four years that she worked in Africa to help make people's lives better.
I don't know anything about your background, but if you are working as a doll's hairstylist, I'm sure you can muster the energy to stop feeling sorry for your SELF, and apologize professionally and in person to this child.
(How can you ask for compassion from others about having to be a doll's hairstylist after the way you treated that girl? Geez!)
"The original poster most likely doesn't even have children."
Yeah, you're right. This is all a long a well-thought out campaign. This woman spent a couple of years writing fake blog posts about being a mom, so that - BOOM - one day she could unleash her post about AG.
It was all a sneaky plan, and you, clever poster, figured it out.
Thanks for suggesting we "try to get some facts." I read the AG website, the AG wiki entry, and some of the other posts by this blogger before commenting. Did you? No?
Guess I have more "facts" than you.
I read some other posts by this blogger. Seems like she has a perpetual chip on her shoulder over her lifestyle choices.
And I didn't get that it was the actual stylist writing. I got that this was a bad situation all around. A lot of people are very suspicious when there's a lynch mob out for anyone's blood, and justly so.
America, people. Innocent until proven guilty. Let's not all act like the current administration here.
I for one have emailed American Girl the following: Shame on your company. Turning away a little girl because her doll wasn't "real" How dare your employee refuse to style the doll's hair. This is quite a black mark on your reputation. "Real" parents are all disgusted with this event having taken place. You just lost a large amount of women buyers, as well as gotten yourself into the largest word of mouth spreaders on earth. MOTHERS!
I for one am a member of mother of multiples (all having twins or more)
This is absolutly appauling.
So be happy with the uptight snooty parents that will remain loyal and buy in to your commercialism."
FORTUNATELY NOT ALL OF US BELIEVE THIS ILL-CONCEIVED STORY. YOU MUST READ "THE ONION" FOR POINTERS.
Wow. Drama queen much?
Way to put your child (and another mom) in a difficult position and then blame for the company for not arranging itself to suit your demands. Why do I have a hard time believing this is the whole story?
Be sure to write again when they won't seat you in first class with a coach ticket or when Rolex won't service your Timex.
Great lesson you've taught your daughter.
I am certain you have done a huge favor to all of us who will now NEVER buy into that type of commercialism and be patrons of American Girl products. I certainly will not. How absolutely awful of that stylist to shame your child in front of others. Don't children learn soon enough that there are differences in socioeconomic status quickly enough?
I view what happened to your child equilvelent to robbing her of her childhood.
SHAME ON YOU AMERICAN GIRL !
I am so sorry this happened to Etta. Please tell her that I too had 3 no-name dolls which were my favourites. I loved them becuse they were special to me. One because it was given to me by my grandparents. The others just because I loved them. Simple but more important than anything else. Children look at life in a different way until the adult world makes them cynical amd materialistic. The children in line that day may well be caught up in their parents idealistic ways of consumerism but Etta clearly is not. AG dolls come with a back story and personality. Where is the make-believe in that? Im sure Gracie has a very unique personality. AG shoudl be ashamed of themselves for the way they handled the situation. I would like to see a public apology from them too. I found this page through a link on Ebay's community pages. Its worldwide so hopefully AG will take notice.
"AG dolls come with a back story and personality."
No, not all of them do. Only the historical dolls. And the Just Like Me dolls not anymore than the Target dolls who come with the story and personality given to them through their costumes and accessories.
The Target dolls' identity comes directly from being AG knock-offs. And anyone who buys an AG knock-off or fake AG clothing is still buying into the commercialism and consumerism of AG. Or else why bring an AG look-a-like to the store? Why not bring a Barbie styling head?
I read your story on Myspace...thats just horrible, to treat a little girl like that? That stylist (WTH? I must be REALLY sheltered living in the midwest, who knew dolls needed a stylist?) should be ashamed of herself. I guess you can take solice in the fact that Karma has a way of coming around and bitting people like her in the butt.
I have a 2y/o son and a baby on the way, gender undetermined just yet, but you can bet if I have a little girl not one penny of my hard earned money will go to that type of company!
To the folks who keep saying things like "don't throw away your kids' AG toys" and "stop ganging up on AG," you need to get a grip.
Customers vote with their pocketbooks.
There is a lesson to be learned here - and AG needs to learn it.
Amen. This is disgusting. Even if the story is only half-true, it's still a pretty revolting half, thank you very much. I've emailed AG and posted about this on my (very popular) site, too.
Here's a great quote from the Digg site:
"...no, it's not the responsibility of the parent to understand the services they will or will not provide upon risk of humiliation."
I can't believe all you people are falling for this! Kudos to the author for having faith in the gullibility of the public.
Wow. Well, Digg and Consumerist are making sure that this gets LOTS of press.
I just fired off my letter to AG expressing my disgust, and I hope others do as well., let alone a "story" that is at BEST a distorted second hand. I can't believe how quickly everyone is buying this "story". I for one am skeptical of what is in my newspaper let alone what I read on the web. I think it will be hilarious when the TRUTH is revealed. All everyone sees this for what it is.
OK as someone familiar with both types of dolls, I will say that it WAS the hair that made the difference. If the stylist messed up the AG doll hair, it can easily be rewigged. If Gracie's hair was damaged, it's rooted hair and therefore cannot be easily fixed. Also, the hair is MUCH different between the brands.
I DO agree about the fact that this was no way to treat a child and the "stylist" should have just said "sorry I can't do any elaborate style" and just gave the doll a simple style that wouldn't damage the hair. The girl does deserve an apology.
There's NOTHING wrong with a doll not being "AG"...it's Etta's doll, she bought it, and it doesn'tneed a fancy label to be special.
I do NOT agree with boycotting AG as a whole because of this. I've bought/collected for nearly 20 years and will continue to do so. Maybe boycott the hair salon at the stores. If you choose not to buy AG because of this, it is, after all, your perogative, just like it is mine to keep buying the dolls. I won't think less of anyone who chooses not to shop AG.
DISGUSTING!!!!
I used to live in Chicago just across the street from the American Girl store. It was creepy to watch the little girls go in and out, carrying their little plastic look-alikes. Most of them even had outfits to match their dolls. It always gave me an icky feeling when I'd see them.
Wow... just wow.... just when humanity has a chance to shine and restore a little faith I may have lost, someone like this has to go screw it up. Those moms need the botox slapped out of them!
The stylist had a chance to make a little girl feel so special, and she just blew it. Even if the store had a policy against doing such a thing, she could have handled things differently.
I'm proud of you and your daughter for the way she saved up her own money for her doll. I'm proud of how you explained to her the consequences of getting the expensive doll. I only wish I could hug Etta!
Hi Etta and Etta’s MOM…... (Yes she deserves the capital letters).
I usually don’t post things but this is a special case.
Who is in charge of hiring these STUPID ………..persons, sorry, not persons, LOOSERS.
That’s what she is, and probably everybody else in that place, otherwise at least one of them should have done or say something.
About the other moms, I don’t think they even deserved to be mentioned in here. (Good thing I wasn't the one that took her there.)
It’s sad that Etta got this lesson so early in her life but she will understand because she’s VERY SMART and will figure out what happened in that place.
It’s sad to read other “people” making doubtful comments about what happened, if it really was this way or that way, WHO F------ CARES. (Sorry I’m not happy right now).
The truth is, she got rejected because it wasn’t a FANCY AG doll, and is good to know that now the whole world knows about the awful place.
Etta: What's important is that you love and care for your doll.
Etta’s MOM: give my LOVE to her and to the rest of the family.
Keep being the MOM you are.
Give Etta a big kiss in my name.
GUS
Please send the link to this page to as many persons as possible, same way we usually do with other stupid (oops, read funny) emails.
Excuse me for my grammar, verbs, etc. Spanish would’ve been easier.
Please help Miss Etta visit our store website at
While we don't have our doll clothes (and many other items) on-line, we do have lovely handsmocked dresses just the right size for Gracie. (In fact, if you will send us Etta's size we will do our best to send her the same smocked dress so she and Gracie can match.)
Please contact the store with your address and sizes and a gift box will be on the way to your doorstep!
This is begining to seem more & more like a contrived incidence to allow some "good samaritins" to promote their own websites. I am still not convinced that this happened as described.
as a mother insist that she get a black doll instead of insisting stores stock dolls of a certain skin type just because you think they should. Vote with your dollars, not complaints. Explain to your daughter about how it is wrong to consider a doll inferior because of it's skin color etc..
I already knew about that study. You proved my point. Black dolls don't sell. Even African American families don't by darker hued babies, so why should the store stock them? Their only legal requirement is to sell the things that sell. Buy a darker skinned baby and they will restock it. If they sell out, they will buy even more babies. You are in control of your daughters perceptions of the world. Do you straighten your hair, dye it, where the latest styles? Do you try to make yourself look anything other than your heritage? I have black curly hair, darker skin than most, but am considered white... until I take my hair out of a pony tail..my point is. I don't see myself as just white. (Don't ask me WHAT I am) I buy dolls that look like my children. My one daughter has blond hair. My others have brown hair and olive skin. Guess who gets what.
I live int he south. The fact that my hair is ...frizzy. Makes people stop and look twice. The fact that my skin is white with frizzy black hair confuses people. In truth my hair is so curly that I have tiny waves on each strand. I don't straighten it, or relax it, even though they told me I should. I don't consider myself white, black, latino, asian, or purple with pink spots.
I am me. I don't know what race I am...and really I don't care. Only in America do we have this black/white view. But thanks for proving my point about the dolls not selling.
Put your foot down...make your child accept a doll that represents her race if it bothers you so much that darker hued babies are harder to find. Otherwise you have no right to complain...you are helping perpetuate the problem.
Goes to show that money cannot buy class, and certainly does not equal good character. Whether one is sucking up to money, as the stylist at AG or actually HAS money, as the classless, flat-charactered "mommies" in line.
Let me be the 200th person to express my outrage at this most devastating story. All I can think when I hear about this kind of callous, shallow, hateful bullshit is that karma is real. I wonder what the return would be for stomping on the dreams of a six-year old?

From the kitchen of One Perfect Bite...Our Christmas celebration begins the day after Thanksgiving with the making of at least one dessert or treat to be served during the Christmas holidays. That first dessert is usually a cake that requires aging, but we've also been known to make cookies that fall into a category we call "keepers". A "keeper" in our parlance is a treat that will not stale before the official holiday begins. Moravian Spice Cookies fall into that category. When I was a child we called these glass cookies, not because of their appearance, but because they were so thin they'd shatter if you dropped them on the floor. They were brought to the United States by members of the Moravian church who settled in colonial American communities established by church elders in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The highly spiced cookies are flavored with molasses and are arguably the world's thinnest cookie. When properly rolled, a one inch stack will contain 16 cookies. I still haven't mastered that challenge, though I continue to try. Over the years, I've made some changes to the original recipe to accommodate the tastes of family and friends. Not everyone appreciates the bold taste of full-flavored molasses and dark brown sugar, so, while the dark versions are more authentic, I prefer to use light molasses and brown sugar. The cookies are simple to make and they are wonderful keepers. Be forewarned that the dough must be refrigerated before it can be rolled, so you'll have to plan your time accordingly. Here's the recipe.
Moravian Spice Cookies...from the kitchen of One Perfect Bite
Ingredients:
1-1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
Pinch of cayenne pepper
3 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons light or dark brown sugar, packed
1/3 cup molasses, light or dark
Directions:
1) Whisk flour, salt, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl. Set aside.
2) Using an electric mixer, cream butter in a small bowl. Add sugar and molasses and mix until combined.
3) Slowly add flour mixture and beat just until smooth.
4) Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 5 hours. Dough will keep several days if refrigerated.
5) Move a rack to upper third of oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with foil. Set aside.
6) Divide dough into 4 parts. Work with 1/4 of dough at a time, keeping the rest refrigerated. Roll dough on a well-floured surface until it is paper thin - 1/16th of an inch thick. Work quickly because dough will become sticky and unworkable if out too long. Cut with a 2-3/4-inch round cookie cutter. Transfer cookies to prepared cookie sheet.
7) Bake until cookies darken slightly, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with remaining portions of dough. Scraps can be reserved and rerolled following refrigeration. Store cooled cookies in an airtight container. Yield: 48 cookies.

I've never gotten the nerve to make these cookies -- don't think I can give them that thing!
Another fantastic recipe that I can't wait to try. Excellent!
Thank you Mary!
:)
ButterYum
I have tried these cookies before--so good with tea but have not tried making them. I love how thin ad crisp they are.
I've never had this before. Love how thin it is and the spiciness.
Mary, that is a gorgeous photo! And the recipe sounds wonderful as well. Thanks!.
Mary, When we lived in Greensboro we used to go Old Salem where the Moravians had there village. They still make the Moravian cookies in the old wood fired ovens and the smell of molasses and spices is heady on a cool winter day.
Mary, this is a marvelous cookie filled with incredible spices and flavor. I usually have to make several batches due to breakage & eating them while they are still warm. Many thanks for reminding me about this old favorite.
A spice cookie wins my heart every time. These are just lovely!
This is my mother's favorite cookie and I haven't made it yet. Now I know what I'll be doing today. Thanks for this recipe, Mary.
I have had these cookies before in NC, and they are FABULOUS. The remind me of the benne cookies in Charleston in terms of their texture and thinness. Your recipe sounds perfect, Mary. Thank you for sharing this. Now, I am craving this for breakfast! LOL!
Happy Pink Saturday!
XO,
Sheila :-)
I've never made these cookies but you've given me courage to give them a try.
Hope you have a happy holiday and a wonderful Pink Saturday.
Sam
Another great recipe... anxious to try to this one..hugs ~lynne~
I have never made these AWESOME!!! cookies before. I love the combination of spices. THANKS!!! for the GREAT!!! recipe.
Geri
Love molasses cookies..these sound really good!
One of these days you will have to take a photo of your recipe file..it must be bulging!!
my mom used to make these :)
A woman in our church used to make these at Christmastime. They're wonderful!
Oh, I bet these are lovely! My mother used to make a dark spice cookie, and then she lost the recipe. I've been trying out recipes ever since to find one that came close.
Yum!
Happy Pink Saturday!
What a lovely tradition! When she's in town, my sister and I make tamales to give to our friends at Christmas time ;-)
My Pink Saturday is at Happily Retired Gal
Hugs and blessings,
Perfect! Thanks for sharing.
Enjoy the holiday season.
wow... I am loving this... I don't think this sounds very Christmassy to me, BUT,,, I think this combination would compliment a rib BBQ dinner as dessert wonderfully. The molasses is a key ingredient in my beans, and the pepper ... well, the pepper is key in my rib rub...
People are always too full to really enjoy a dessert, but a wafer thin little treat passed around would be gobbled up
this is a keeper
I've heard of these and they sound delicious. I love trying all different kinds of cookies....yours look so pretty!
Mary they look wonderful..I just saw your newest adorable cookie:) Congratulations!
allspice, ginger...I am making this now :)
This makes me want to run and grab a cup of tea, they look so good, Happy Pink Saturday Mary and thanks again for a perfect recipe, Char
Oh they look so pretty. Kind of cookie you share with a girlfriend over hot coffee and tell secrets.
Mary,
Just coming by to say hi on Pink Saturday!!
Christmas Blessings
barbara jean
these sound lovely never would have thought cookies could keep so well have a fab christmas loads of love Val
These are gorgeously thin and crispy. I love these spices - I want them. These are perfect holiday cookies.
Happy Pink Saturday and Happy Holidays to you and your family, Mary.
I love these cookies. We have been to Old Salem in Winston Salem, North Carolina, and the some yummy scents come from the bakery.
I can't believe you actually have this recipe. I am going to have to try this for my husband.
Sorry I'm so late visiting you - I'm in for another eye op in January, so I'm having to keep computer stuff to minimum time and small doses, unfortunately.
Lovely, mouthwatering post as always!
I've got a family sherry trifle recipe on mine, if you'd like to add it to your collection.
Belated Happy Pink Saturday! And Happy Christmas (I won't be participating in the upcoming, Boxing Day one).
Thanks for making this recipe publicly available!
I hadn't heard of Moravian cookies until I stumbled across a small 3.5oz can of them by the Salem Baking Co., on sale at TJMaxx. The small container intrigued me, because the nutritional label said 12 cookies per serving, and that there were about 3.5 servings inside. How could over 40 cookies fit into this small container? Well indeed, they are about 1/16" thick!
I can't see making them that thin, but even at 1/8" that's still a reasonably thin cookie. The Salem Baking Company cookies are incredibly good, and I imagine these will either come close or match that. :-)
G, I hope you'll like these. They are a favorite of mine.
I made these last weekend and we love them. You quickly get the hang of rolling them. A couple of tips: 1) don't be afraid to use flour so they don't stick, but brush the extra flour off with a pastry brush before you bake them, 2) a bench scraper works awesomely to get the cookies off the counter after you've rolled them out. I was able to roll them until they were almost see-through and then scrape them up with the bench scraper and put them on the cookie sheet. They aren't so fragile to handle; they are more fragile to roll as they stick to the rolling pin and the dough tears if you roll too fast. Try them - you will love them too!
I love cookies .. Need to post something too. I have a few recipes you may like too :
PS:I foolow you :)

The tragedy at the Boston Marathon really, really bothered me. Which, obviously, it should have. It was so awful, so senseless, so horrific. It made me mad, sad, full of grief for those affected, horrified, stupefied as to why anyone would do this to another person, and so many more emotions I can’t even describe. It brings tears to my eyes to think about it.
It wasn’t just that it makes me so dang mad that someone would hurt innocent people who were just enjoying the day and celebrating with those who ran in this iconic event, which it did. It wasn’t just that it was so horrific and senseless, which it was. It wasn’t just that our daughter’s good friend lives in Boston and was running in the marathon on Monday and that we were concerned for her safety, which we were. (We couldn’t get ahold of her for a while and were really worried about her. She’s fine, having run the race in 3h 14m 07s, but we didn’t know where she was in relation to the blast zone and if she was safe.) This tragedy bothered me on so many levels that it took me a few days to sort it out.
As I thought about it, I realized that it really touched a nerve of very personal vulnerability, one that goes back to Jason’s death. It made me feel so vulnerable. We tend to think that tragedy happens to “other people.” Until WE are those “other people” whose children die. Until WE are the family touched by tragedy. Until WE are that country where bombs go off in crowded places and kills and harms innocent bystanders.
I recently read a poem written by By Madelaine Perri Kasden:
OTHER PEOPLE
Every so often,
you hear about other people
losing their child.
Sometimes there is a horrible accident
you find out about on television.
Sometimes it is a senseless murder or suicide
you read about in the newspaper.
Sometimes you learn about a deadly illness over
the telephone because, this time,
he child belongs to someone you know
When such a tragedy happens,
to other people,
your heart goes out to them.
You feel deeply saddened and perhaps,
you shed a few tears.
You then continue your charmed life,
going about business as usual.
You don’t forget, but,
you don’t necessarily remember either.
After all, the death of a child
is something that occurs in the lives
of other people.
Unless, God forbid,
the television story or newspaper article or
telephone call
is about your child.
Unless, one terrible day,
heaven and earth and hell become one.
Unless your life loses all meaning and
nothing makes sense anymore.
Suddenly,
by a random twist of fate, or the hand of God,
you have become other people.
By Madelaine Perri Kasden
Before Jason died, I was one of those people who felt like the death of a child was something that happened to “other people.” Tragedy happened to “other people.” I was like a teenager marching through life, feeling invincible. I prayed for my family. I was sure beyond a doubt that God heard my prayers and would protect my family. Terrible tragedies happened to people in other places; great tragedy would never touch me or happen to me.
But it did. My child died. And it made me feel so incredibly vulnerable. I was not protected from tragedy. I was not immune. We were ordinary people, doing ordinary things, living our ordinary daily lives.
I became “that person” whose child died. Jason was taken from us by the actions of someone else, a drunk driver. I felt like someone ripped my entire chest open, leaving my most inner self bare, raw, and exposed to unbelievable grief and pain. I became “that person” who no longer was thought of as “Becky.” I became the “mother of Jason, the young man who died in the car accident.” People would whisper to each other about me, point me out to each other. People would avoid me, look right through me as if they didn’t see me. I became a grieving mess, a lonely pariah who struggled to get through the day. I was touched by tragedy, changed by the death of my child. I had to learn to “find a new normal,” find a way to weave Jason’s loss into my life, find a way to learn to walk again without Jason in this life. My life became divided into “before” and “after” by that stark moment of vulnerability when Jason died.
Those people in Boston were ordinary people experiencing a wonderful slice of Americana at the iconic Boston Marathon. In a split second of vulnerability, the security that tragedy happens to “someone else” was taken from them; it was robbed from them by a terrorist’s actions. They are now people whose lives are affected by this tragedy forever, and they will never be the same. Their lives will be divided in so many ways into “before” and “after” by that stark moment of vulnerability when that bomb went off, when some lost dear family members, when some lost limbs and will have to learn to walk again in a new manner, when some witnessed a horrific scene of human suffering that will forever be burned into their memories. It all happened to ordinary people in one split moment of vulnerability.
And when something like the bomb blasts in Boston or some other tragedy happens, it touches a nerve deep inside me and I feel incredibly vulnerable all over again. It makes me feel anxious and restless, almost the the point of being panic-y. Because, as a parent whose child has died, I know all too well that it can be just one split moment in time from MY child is alive and well…to the moment when tragedy has happened and MY child is gone. There’s no going back, no way to change what’s happened. Jason died when he was broadsided by a drunk driver who was going more than twice the speed limit. Three people died in Boston at the hands of a terrorist. Beautiful, innocent children died in Newtown. People died in an explosion in Texas.
As much as we’d like to think we are immune from tragedy, we really aren’t. I wish we could be, but we’re not. As long as we live in an imperfect world, we are not immune from the possibility of becoming that “other person” that has been touched by tragedy. And that’s why I felt so vulnerable – all over again – when I heard of the Boston tragedy.
I don’t know why tragedies hit some people and not others; or, as the title to Harold S. Kushner’s book says, why “Bad Things Happen to Good People.” I don’t know why things happen the way they do. I pray for the protection of my family and those I know, knowing as I do now that we don’t live in a perfect world and that none of us are truly immune and that we are vulnerable to tragedy. I pray for those I know who are going through grief as they have never known before. I pray that good will come from what I have experienced and walked through, that what I have to say here will create a greater understanding for those who deeply grieve. I know that I will see Jason again. I am doing the best I can to rebuild my life and reconstruct my faith. I long to know the security as I once did, with all my heart, that I serve a God who is not untouched by our pain, suffering, and tragedy. I pray and pray for my family, along with saying, “Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.”
Perhaps we can use this as a reminder of how fleeting life can be and encourage ourselves to really take time to extend comfort, love, and kindness to those within our sphere of influence – our family, our friends, our co-workers, our neighbors, our acquaintances. Listen to those little “nudges” that seem to come from inside of you, telling you to take time to do something special for someone. We never know when those moments may be gone forever.
My thoughts and prayers are with those people affected by this terrible tragedy in Boston and to those affected by the blast in Texas. I wish I could put my arms around you and show you how much I care. Sending hugs, hugs, and more hugs…

Why just one miraculous world?
Q:What is your vision of heaven? What images - from Scripture, tradition, culture or your personal experience - best describe heaven for you?
Can we imagine heaven? Mark Twain quipped that people assume heaven will be green fields and harp music - an eternity of activities no one would enjoy for five minutes while still alive. When we try to picture perfection, our imaginations stall: music, seeing loved ones, eternity staring at the stars. Sooner or later, heaven gets, well, monotonous.
Surely if there is a heaven, it is nothing like what we imagine. We would not have imagined this world, after all, before we entered it. Who would have guessed mountains and eyes and tuna fish and tables and fossils and crock-pots and libraries and clouds?. Believers may take comfort in the thought that whichever way it goes, only they have the possibility of experiencing themselves proved right.
I am a believer. I have faith that the intangible is the greatest reality. I cannot know what heaven would be like, but in the end, the question is not about heaven, but about God. If there exists a God who created us and keeps faith with us, then we have a bit of eternity planted inside us. God willing, one day I'll see you there.

Plate-like ZrB2 grains were synthesized at 1550°C by in situ solid/liquid reaction using Zr and B powders mixed with transition metal (Mo,Nb,Ti, or W) and Si powder. The preferred growth direction of plate grains was along a- or b-axis depending on the initial content of transition metal and silicon in the mixtures. The synthesis mechanism of plate-like grain was possibly related to the catalysis of in situ formed silicides.

BE on a par with Tibet as out-of-bounds areas where foreign reporters need special permission to work, and come after journalists were attacked and harassed while working in the areas over the weekend.
Bob Dietz, the Asia coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the treatment of journalists in Beijing on Sunday was “the worst aggression against the foreign press we’ve seen since the Olympics in 2008.”
“Such a heavy-handed response discredits the ruling Chinese Communist Party and highlights their fear of popular opposition,” Dietz said in a statement.

The Canadian Soccer Association in cooperation with FIFA delegates recently held Futsal workshops in the areas of Coaching and Refereeing in Laval and Ottawa with the aim of the advancement of the sport of Futsal in Canada.
The FIFA Futsal Coach Instructor course ran from 18 October to 22 October in Laval, QC. The course material was designed to prepare the participants to provide training to additional Canadian Futsal coaches. FIFA Instructor Constantine Konstin led 30 participants representing six Canadian provinces as well as two guest trainers from Burkina Faso and Cote D’Ivoire through the five day session.
“The course provided a great introduction for the game of Futsal into the Canadian Soccer Association structure,” said Ms. Beliveau. “The combination of expert instructors in the game of soccer and others in the game of Futsal created a great mix and a good model for sharing expertise.”
The OSA Futsal Committee is pleased to present one day Futsal workshops/clinics for any member clubs that will be starting up new Futsal leagues or programs. We would like to provide valuable information on the important FIFA Futsal laws of the game, tactical components and comprehension from a Canadian Futsal national team player, all to assist coaches and technical development directors who will be involved in starting these new leagues up.
The workshop will last approximately 6-8 hours.
Please kindly contact the Futsal Department with information regarding the workshop date so that Futsal committee members can coordinate to visit your district to provide this vitally valuable overview of Futsal before your leagues or training sessions begin.

This past Friday night, December 2, at Dover Downs in Dover, Delaware, undefeated and world-ranked heavyweight sensation, Amir ‘Hardcore’ Mansour remained perfect by scoring a sixth round stoppage over former light heavyweight world title challenger Epifanio Mendoza and captured the WBF intercontinental championship that highlighted an exciting eight bout card.
Mansour and Mendoza thrilled the sellout crowd at Dover Downs with Mansour throwing some wicked shots to the head and body of Mendoza. Mendoza showed surprisingly good defense and decent counter punching ability. Tensions grew during the fight as both landed shots after the bell that nearly incited a brawl.
In the sixth, Mansour landed a huge flurry of punches that forced the corner of Mendoza to throw in the towel.
Mansour, ranked number seven by the WBO, raised his mark to 16-0-0, 12ko and he indicated the he is ready to take on anybody in the top ten. Mendoza fought well but fell to 32-13-1.
In the co-feature, light heavyweight Anthony Caputo Smith had a few tense moments but scored an incredible final round stoppage over Douglas Okola in a six round bout.
Smith was dropped and then cut badly over his right eye and it was looking like his perfect mark would be falling by the wayside. In the final round, Okola walked into a huge left hook that put him down and out and in an instant Smith scored the knockout. Smith is now 12-0-0, 10ko.
Veteran Dorin Spivey scored his 40th professional victory with a solid six round unanimous decision over rugged and tough-as-nails Angel Rios in a lightweight bout. Spivey boxed well by putting some solid combinations together. Rios never had any quit in him and kept coming forward and even buckled Spivey during the fight.
Spivey will now look to jump into the rankings when he takes on Victor Vasquez on February 4. Ironically, Vasquez was ringside calling the action with Marc Abrams during this bout.
Mike Tiberi made it 18-1 with a solid six round unanimous decision over Puerto Rico’s Emill Gonzalez in a Super Middleweight bout.

They’re all scams. Many will want money up front. None will pay you. Some will steal your identity or infect your system with viruses. You’ll be on every sucker list known to man.
You’ll probably get a bunch of responses claiming to the the one real non-spam answer to your dreams. A few to expect:cashcrate, neobux, actually anything with *bux* in the name.
Make sure to do a yahoo/google search on anything posted followed by keywords like scam, spam, fraud.
Some people don’t like the idea of making money online because they think it’s all a scam. But I do this really good site called fusion cash. It’s free and easy to sign up, you just have to be at least 13 years old. I’m not saying you’ll get rich but it’s a good way to get a little extra spending money. Anybody (from anywhere) can do it. If you want more info you can check out
Then there’s this other good site called associated content which pays you for your essays/articles that you may have done for school, in your spare time, etc. They also pay you for how many people read you pieces of content.

This cause arose when a Ziffrin trucktractor, which had installed on its right front wheel a tire manufactured by Armstrong, went off the highway allegedly due to a tire blowout, while being driven by Collins, and turned over, killing Collins.
The only issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in including, over the objections of appellants, certain matters in its instruction number 16.
The pertinent parts of instruction 16 read:
'* * * and/or if you find the proximate cause of the happening was due to abnormal use of the tire or the use thereof beyond the reasonable safe period of its life expectancy; * * * and/or if you find that the tire failed and collapsed when it struck the pole or earthen embankment; * * * and/or if you find the tractor had defective equipment which proximately caused the happening; and/or if you find the tractor had abnormally defective equipment or abnormal lack of maintenance which proximately caused the tire to become defective or aggravated any existing defect or defects in such tire so as to proximately cause the happening; and/or if you find that the tire's life expectancy had expired for front wheel usage because it had reached the point of the treads having been reduced to from somewhere between one-half (1/2) to eighty five per cent (85%) of their original structure with the visually known worn cupping defect and which was known to the operator because of steering wheel vibration and that such proximately caused the alleged tire failure and/or caused the mechanical failure to the tractor which proximately caused the happening; then you would be warranted in finding the plaintiffs have failed to prove an essential element and/or elements of their complaints.'
It is urged that this instruction was not predicated on evidence adduced at trial, that it was therefore prejudicial, allowing the jury to find that the tire failure, alleged to have been the cause of the accident, occurred for reasons not shown in evidence and not urged by the parties.
In Indiana, prejudicial error may result from an instruction on an issue formed by the pleadings and concerning which there is no evidence. Hayes Freight Lines v. Oestricher, 117 Ind.App. 143, 147, 66 N.E.2d 612,68 N.E.2d 792 (1946). Instructions are regarded as a total charge to the jury, and if an instruction, which standing alone might be erroneous, is cured by other instructions in the charge, then no reversible error exists. Ewing v. Timmons, 135 Ind.App. 274, 277, 193 N.E.2d 497 (1963). Furthermore, instructions are proper if they are within the issues and the evidence is conflicting, cf. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Gordon, 109 Ind.App. 58, 61-62, 32 N.E.2d 727 (1941), or if the instructions are 'pertinent to any question of fact which the jury may properly consider under the evidence, or any ligitimate inferences which may be drawn from the evidence.' Schlarb v. Henderson, 211 Ind. 1, 7-8, 4 N.E.2d 205 (1936).
The Indiana Appellate Court has also said:
'If there were any facts or circumstances in the case, although quite meager, to which the instructions might, upon any view, be pertinent, provided they were correct in the statement of the law, it would not be error for the court to give them, although they were so given to the jury over the objection of the complaining party.' Pennsylvania Ice & Coal Co. v. Elischer, 106 Ind.App. 613, 621, 21 N.E.2d 436, 439 (1939).
In considering whether an instruction applies to the evidence, a trial court must consider the evidence in its entirety, together with all reasonable inferences which might be drawn from it. Elischer, supra.
Appellants argue, however, that notwithstanding the fact that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants, there is some evidence in the record relating to the matters covered in instruction 16, there is no evidence that these matters could possibly have been the proximate cause of the alleged blowout.
Where the determination of proximate cause depends upon a state of facts from which different men might reasonably draw different inferences or conclusions, the question of proximate cause is a question of fact for the jury. Siebeking et al. v. Ford, Admx., etc., 128 Ind.App. 475, 485, 148 N.E.2d 194 (1958). If there is any reasonable doubt as to proximate cause, it is also for the jury. Phares v. Carr, 122 Ind.App. 597, 603, 106 N.E.2d 242 (1952).
Since proximate cause is a question for the jury, and since the jury is broadly entitled to draw inferences from facts presented, we are not persuaded that, to avoid a presumption of prejudice, there must be evidence that the matters upon which the trial court instructed the jury could have or did proximately cause the blowout. The only question is whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to consider those matters as bearing on the question of proximate cause.
While the contested instruction was rather long and may be subject to minor criticisms, we do not find it prejudicial. We conclude from an examination of the entire record, and from a reading of the instructions taken as a whole, that appellants received a fair trial and that the jury was not improperly instructed.
Appellants raise further objections to other parts of instruction 16. We have reviewed such other portions objected to. In reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants, we find that such other portions of such instruction are not prejudicially erroneous for the reasons hereinabove stated.
In the first trial of this action on the negligence count only, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants, and this we affirmed. Dagley, supra. In the instant appeal, another jury, hearing substantially the same evidence, found for the defendants on the breach of implied warranty count. The evidence amply supports such a verdict in this case.
In reviewing the instructions as a whole, we conclude that in other instructions given, and not challenged on appeal, the issues to be determined by the jury, the burden of proof, the theory of plaintiff's complaint, the law relating to proximate cause and the resolution of conflicting testimony, resulted in the jury being fairly and adequately instructed.
The judgment appealed from is affirmed.
Affirmed.

Before LUMBARD, MULLIGAN and VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judges.
VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judge:
This is an appeal from a judgment in favor of the executors of one corporate creditor against another corporate creditor whose right to receive payment was made subordinate to that of plaintiffs' testate. Two questions are presented:
1. Did the subordinated creditor have the right to discharge an unmatured subordinated indebtedness without the consent of the senior creditor?
2. Was there payment of a matured, subordinated debenture when the subordinated creditor took the note of the debtor's parent corporation instead of cash?
Litigation between the paties has now been in progress for fifteen years, and three opinions of the District Court have been reported. Buchman v. American Foam Rubber Corp., 250 F.Supp. 60 (S.D.N.Y.1965); First National Bank v. American Foam Rubber Corp., 306 F.Supp. 593 (S.D.N.Y.1969); First National Bank v. American Foam Rubber Corp., 309 F.Supp. 547 (S.D.N.Y.1969).1 Repetition will not improve upon the recitals of fact contained in these opinions, and we will therefore review only so much background as is necessary to frame the issues on this appeal.
Prior to 1957, appellees' testate, Samuel Buchman, was president and a substantial stockholder of American Foam Rubber Corp. (AFR), a New York corporation. On May 17, 1957, Buchman resigned and sold his interest in AFR and its affiliate, Burlington Holding Corporation, to appellants. As part of the agreement of sale, certain debentures of the two corporations, maturing in 1960 and 1965, which were held by appellants, were subordinated to debentures held by Buchman. The pertinent portion of the subordination agreement reads as follows:
To induce Samuel Buchman to sell his capital stock hereunder, Marie Louise deMontmollin and Alexander F. Pathy hereby agree with respect to the debentures of each of said corporations that the rights of any holder (including her or him) of the debentures thereof now held by her or him and referred to above, be subordinated to the rights of any holder or holders of the debentures thereof now held by Samuel Buchman (including him) as to the payment of interest and principal. No claim for interest under the debentures so subordinated shall be made unless all interest payable on the debentures now held by Samuel Buchman shall have been paid in full, and no claim for principal under any of the debentures so subordinated shall be made unless the entire principal of all the debentures now held by Samuel Buchman shall have been paid in full.
If for any reason, either corporation shall pay interest or principal on said debentures to any of the Buyers, or to any person deriving title to the debentures of said corporation from any of the Buyers, and said payment shall be made without first satisfying the priority to which the holder or holders of Samuel Buchman's debentures are entitled by reason of the foregoing provisions, the amount or amounts of the payment so made to the buyer (or to the person deriving title from her or him) shall be promptly paid by such Buyer to said holder or holders of Samuel Buchman's debentures.
A similar agreement of subordination was made with respect to some corporate promissory notes which were held by the parties.
In 1958, AFR decided to issue new stock for the purpose of improving its capital structure; and, over a period of time, appellant deMontmollin surrendered subordinated AFR debentures and notes with a face value of $322,000 for preferred stock with an equivalent face value.
On April 1, 1960, the Burlington debentures became due. Buchman was paid in cash for his, and Mrs. deMontmollin received a credit on Burlington's books for $15,000, the amount of her debentures. She immediately loaned this money to AFR, receiving a promissory note in return.2 This was accomplished by a bookkeeping transfer of assets from Burlington to AFR; no money passed through appellants' hands.
On February 21, 1961, AFR was adjudicated a bankrupt. In its opinion, 306 F.Supp. 593, 601, the District Court stated that, if Mrs. deMontmollin had not surrendered the $322,000 in debentures and notes, appellees, because of their right to priority in payment under the subordination agreement, would have been entitled to recover the bankruptcy dividends payable on these obligations. It therefore held appellant deMontmollin liable for the amount of the dividend which would have been paid. The District Court also held that the transaction involving the $15,000 Burlington debentures constituted payment of those debentures within the meaning of the subordination agreement and that appellant deMontmollin was liable for this amount. Id. at 607.
We reverse the holding of the District Court insofar as it predicates liability upon the exchange of the AFR debentures and notes for stock and affirm its holding insofar as it predicates liability upon the payment of the Burlington debentures.
The Exchange Transaction
Before examining the District Judge's theory of liability, we first note our approval of his rejection of an alternate theory which had been proposed by plaintiffs. Judge Cooper held that the exchange of debentures and notes for preferred stock did not constitute payment of these obligations, as that term was used in the subordination agreement, since no assets of the corporation passed into the creditors' hands. 306 F.Supp. at 599. Neither, he said, was the issuance of stock the first step in a plan to secure payment, since AFR was precluded by other contractual provisions from paying dividends or redeeming stock. Id. at 600. We find no error in these holdings.
Judge Cooper's theory of liability was that appellant had breached an implied provision in the subordination agreement that the subordinated debt would not be discharged.3 He stated that the subordinated debt was 'a type of security for the senior debt, available to the senior creditor upon a distribution of the assets of the debtor' and might therefore be regarded as a 'cushion' or 'support' for the senior debt. 306 F.Supp. at 599. Although he then specifically refused to determine the true nature of the interest, 'if any', created in favor of the senior creditor, he held that, in the absence of provisions to the contrary, it was a breach of the subordination agreement for the junior creditor to discharge the subordinated debt. Id. at 606. We disagree.
The subordination agreement provided in substance that neither interest nor principal should be paid on the subordinated debt unless the interest and principal on the senior debt were paid in full and that, if such payments were made, they would be promptly paid over to the senior creditor. Clearly, the senior creditor had both equitable and contractual rights in the proceeds of such payments. Similar rights would attach to dividends declared in the estate of the bankrupt creditor. In re Credit Industrial Corporation, 366 F.2d 402 (2d Cir. 1966); Calligar, Subordination Agreements, 70 Yale L.J. 376, 383 (1961).
Various theories have been advanced to support the enforcement of subordination agreements in bankruptcy: equitable lien, equitable assignment, constructive trust and enforcement of contractual rights. In re Itemlab Inc., 197 F.Supp. 194, 197 (E.D.N.Y.1961); Calligar, supra, 70 Yale L.J. at 384; Leiby, Enforcement and the U.C.C., 23 Bus. Lawyer 57 (1967). This Circuit has favored the recognition of priorities based upon the 'lawful contractual arrangement between the parties.' In re Aktiebolaget Kreuger & Toll, 96 F.2d 768, 770 (2d Cir. 1938). As we stated in In re Credit Industrial Corporation, supra, 366 F.2d at 407, if the terms of the contract are unambiguous, there is no need to resort to 'strained theories of third-party beneficiary, estoppel or general principles of equity' to determine the rights of the parties.
Since most of the decisions in this area have dealt with the priority of payments in bankruptcy, there has been little need for the courts to explore the rights of the parties beyond those which attach to the bankruptcy dividends. The rules which have been laid down in these cases are not, therefore, determinative of the senior creditor's pre-bankruptcy rights, if any, in the payment which has not yet accrued or the dividend which has not been declared, i.e., in the debt itself.4 To justify the judgment in favor of plaintiffs below, they must have had rights, rights of such nature that they precluded defendant's good faith discharge of the subordinated debt.
No recital of such rights can be found in the contractual arrangement between the parties. The terms of the subordination agreement are unambiguous and include no prohibition against discharge of the subordinated indebtedness. Moreover, based upon our decision in Cherno v. Dutch American Mercantile Corporation, 353 F.2d 147 (2d Cir. 1965), we see no equitable basis for holding that a prohibition should be implied.
The facts in Cherno are not dissimilar from those we are now considering. There, the subordinated creditor discharged a chattel mortgage which he held as security, in order that the debtor could mortgage the property to a third party. In denying the senior creditor's claim that it was a preferred lien creditor as an equitable assignee or equitable lienholder, we held that the usual subordination agreement simply gives priority or precedence of lien right and debt payment to the senior creditor and does not constitute an assignment of the subordinated debt. Id. at 151. We also rejected the senior creditor's claim of a security interest in the debt. In so doing, we anticipated the provisions of § 1--209 of the N.Y. Uniform Commercial Code, enacted the following year.5 Finally, we held that the senior creditor was not the beneficiary of a constructive trust, because the subordinated creditor was not being unjustly enriched by holding property in which the senior creditor had an interest.
In denying the existence of an equitable lien in, or equitable assignment of, the subordinated debt, we were following rules of law well established in both the New York and Federal courts. Generally, these courts have held that an agreement to pay out of a particular fund does not create an equitable lien upon the fund or operate as an equitable assignment thereof. East Side Packing Co. v. Fahy Market, 24 F.2d 644, 645 (2d Cir. 1928); Union Trust Co. v. Townshend, 101 F.2d 903 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 307 U.S. 646, 59 S.Ct. 1044, 83 L.Ed. 1526 (1939); B. Kuppenheimer & Co. v. Mornin, 78 F.2d 261, 264 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 296 U.S. 615, 56 S.Ct. 135, 80 L.Ed. 436 (1935); Cabell v. Markham, 69 F.Supp. 640, 642 (S.D.N.Y.1946), aff'd sub nom. Cabell v. Clark, 162 F.2d 153 (2d Cir. 1947); People ex rel. Balbrook Realty Corp. v. Mills, 295 N.Y. 190, 195, 66 N.E.2d 50 (1946). To accomplish an assignment, the would-be assignor must relinquish control over the fund. The test is whether there is 'an appropriation of the fund so that the debtor would be justified in paying the debt or the assigned part to the person claiming to be the assignee.' Hinkle Iron Co. v. Kohn, 229 N.Y. 179, 183, 128 N.E. 113, 114 (1920); In re Conoley, 50 F.Supp. 542 (S.D.N.Y.1942).
Whatever may have been the situation with regard to payments due and owing to Mrs. deMontmollin, we think it clear from the foregoing authorities that Mr. Buchman, as senior creditor, had no equitable rights as assignee or lienholder in the debt itself. Thomas v. New York and Greenwood Lake Rwy. Co., 139 N.Y. 163, 178, 34 N.E. 877 (1893). AFR, the debtor, had no right to pay any part of the unmatured debt to Mr. Buchman, the senior creditor.
It is interesting to note that this was the specific holding of the court in In re Dodge-Freedman Poultry Co., 148 F.Supp. 647 (D.N.H.1956), aff'd sub nom. Dodge-Freedman Poultry Co. v. Delaware Mills Inc., 244 F.2d 314 (1st Cir. 1957) (per curiam), relied upon by the court below. That case involved the waiver by a subordinated creditor of a bankruptcy dividend and the preservation of such dividend for the senior creditor through the doctrine of constructive trust. The court said, 148 F.Supp. at 651:
In the case at bar, there was no manifestation of intention, either written or oral, or by conduct, on the part of Freedman (the subordinated creditor) to relinquish control, or to make any appropriation to Delaware Mills, Inc. (the senior creditor). Therefore, no equitable assignment was created, nor is there an equitable lien.
Judge Cooper quite correctly recognized, on the basis of our decision in Cherno, that plaintiffs could claim no rights as beneficiaries of a constructive trust, since Mrs. deMontmollin never had any property in her possession in which plaintiffs had any equitable interest. 306 F.Supp. at 603 n. 38. Having thus rejected appellees' last possible equitable claim, it is not surprising that Judge Cooper would 'intimate no view on the 'true nature' of the interest created, if any.'6 Id. at 606.
Judge Cooper's reliance upon a statement in Cherno that the subordinated creditor breached the subordination agreement when it discharged a chattel mortgage given to it as collateral, is, we think, misplaced. That statement was dictum. Moreover, the proof in Cherno showed that the collateral was discharged subsequent to default by the insolvent debtor on both the subordinated debt and the senior indebtedness, while an action to recover on the latter was pending. We described it as part of a 'scheme' to get additional cash from an innocent lender. 353 F.2d at 149.
The discharge of the subordinated indebtedness in the instant case occurred before its maturity and three years prior to the debtor's bankruptcy. There is no claim of any 'scheme' or bad faith and no contention that the discharge was made in contemplation of bankruptcy. Nonetheless, Judge Cooper determined in 1969 that the discharge constituted a breach of the subordination agreement and then waited five years until the termination of the bankruptcy proceedings in 1974 to compute the amount of plaintiffs' damages. Only in this way could he ascertain the amount of the 'double dividend' which he said plaintiffs lost.7
It requires little imagination to conceive of the discharge of a subordinated debt many years prior to bankruptcy, or, indeed, without any subsequent bankruptcy ever taking place. If the decision appealed from is correct, such discharge would nonetheless be a breach of the subordination agreement, because of the remote chance that bankruptcy might someday occur and the senior creditor might thereafter be deprived of a double dividend.8 We think that if the senior creditor would prohibit a discharge because of such remote contingencies, he should so provide in the subordination agreement.
We hold, therefore, that appellees' testate had no equitable or contractual rights in the unmatured obligations which prevented appellant from discharging them in good faith.
The Loan Transaction
Appellant's argument that the loan transaction was simply a series of bookkeeping entries between parent and subsidiary corporation was properly rejected by the District Court. Where a creditor takes the bill, note or check of a third party instead of insisting upon performance to the letter of his contract with the debtor, a reasonable inference may sometimes be drawn that the primary obligation has been paid and discharged. charged. Hamilton v. R. S. Dickson & Co., 85 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1936); 70 C.J.S. Payment § 29 (1951). Judge Cooper was entitled to find that when, upon the maturity of the Burlington debentures, Mrs. deMontmollin released that company from its indebtedness and took an AFR note in substitution therefor, this was payment of the debentures within the meaning of the subordination agreement. Moreover, although no money passed through appellant's hands, the effects of the transaction, as Judge Cooper held, were the same as if it had.
Plaintiffs were entitled to recover the amount of this payment by virtue of the specific provisions of the subordination agreement. This being so, we need not consider appellant's equitable defense of lack of clean hands, based on Mr. Buchman's allegedly improper conduct in other matters involving AFR.
We affirm that portion of the judgment appealed from which is based on the payment of the $15,000 in Burlington debentures and reverse that portion based upon the discharge of the $322,000 in AFR debentures and notes, with costs of the appeal to appellant, and remand to the District Court for judgment in accordance with this decision.
Appellants claim that Judge Cooper abused his discretion by basing his decision on an implied provision not to discharge the indebtedness because that theory was not pleaded by any of the parties and contradicted previous rulings by the court that allegedly limited the issues to be tried. While these allegations would provide sufficient grounds for reversal if Judge Cooper had, as implied by appellants, raised and resolved issues sua sponte that prejudiced appellants, see United Transportation Union v. State Bar of Michigan, 401 U.S. 576, 91 S.Ct. 1076, 28 L.Ed.2d 339 (1971); Reynolds v. Stockton, 140 U.S. 254, 266, 11 S.Ct. 773, 35 L.Ed. 464 (1891), in this instance Judge Cooper was entitled to consider the claim of the loss of a 'double dividend' in bankruptcy
On May 9, 1967, Judge Cooper issued an opinion denying defendants' motion for summary judgment on the subordination claim. Judge Cooper defined the 'plain meaning' of the subordination agreement as prohibiting defendants 'from realizing any cash or its equivalent from the corporation until Buchman's debentures had been satisfied in full.' Judge Cooper indicated that the Exchange Transactions would not violate the subordination agreement thus defined unless it constituted 'a first step in a plan to obtain cash--or cash realizable property--from the corporation.' It was to decide this latter question that Judge Cooper proceeded to trial.
After a three-day trial to the court in December 1968, Judge Cooper rendered his decision on July 23, 1969. With respect to the Exchange Transaction, he held that the discharge of the debentures and receipt of the preferred stock did not constitute 'payment' within the meaning of the subordination agreement. 306 F.Supp. at 599--600. Judge Cooper also determined that the exchange was not a first step in a plan to obtain cash that could constitute a breach of the agreement under the May 9, 1967, interpretation. Nevertheless, the judge concluded that the Exchange Transaction breached the agreement because it deprived Buchman of his 'double dividend' in bankruptcy. Since Judge Cooper had indicated in his opinion of May 9, 1967, that the subsequent trial would be limited to the question of whether the Exchange Transaction constituted the first step in a plan to obtain cash, appellants forcefully argue that appellees were restricted by the law of the case to a recovery on the issue of premature payment. Thus, appellants argue, once the district court found no such payment, the inquiry should have ended and judgment should have been entered on their behalf.
Our reading of the record reveals that the 'double dividend' theory was not based on an issue or on facts that the parties did not have the opportunity to litigate at trial and that Judge Cooper's consideration of the issue did not unduly prejudice appellants. At an early point during the first day of the trial, appellees offered evidence bearing on AFR's status in bankruptcy in order to prove the amount of the dividend that Buchman would have received in bankruptcy had appellants' debentures not been exchanged for stock. Appellees also noted that they had advocated this theory of recovery throughout the pretrial proceedings, and this point was not denied by appellants. Thus, it appears that appellants were fully apprised of the 'double dividend' issue both prior to and during the trial and could have introduced evidence to the effect that the parties never intended the subordination agreement to cover the parties' rights in bankruptcy, had that indeed been the understanding. No such evidence was offered.
The fact that the relief requested in the pleadings did not include the lost dividend would not preclude Judge Cooper from granting relief on that theory. The pleadings recited all the facts relevant to the Exchange Transaction and appellants cannot have been surprised by the evidence proffered at trial. Once the issue was raised at trial, Judge Cooper was entitled to grant relief on a theory not pleaded by any party but relying on pleaded and proven facts. See United States ex rel. Bergen Point Iron Works v. Maryland Casualty Co., 384 F.2d 303, 304 (2d Cir. 1967); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(c); 10 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2664, at 104--05 (1973).
Nor can we say that Judge Cooper's May 9, 1967, decision irrevocably bound him not to consider the parties' rights in bankruptcy at the subsequent trial. In this Circuit, the law of the case is a discretionary doctrine that need not be applied when no prejudice results from its omission. See Dictograph Products Co. v. Sonotone Corp., 230 F.2d 131, 135 (2d Cir.), appeal dismissed, 352 U.S. 883, 77 S.Ct. 104, 1 L.Ed.2d 82 (1956). Since appellants were on notice both prior to and during the trial that appellees would request judgment on the basis of the dividend lost as a result of the Exchange Transaction, the appellants did not suffer prejudice or surprise such as to render it improper for the district court to reach that question.
'Cases in this area are not helpful in solving the question of whether the subordination, if it is a lien or assignment, is a lien or assignment of the note itself or of certain rights arising by virtue of the note.' Zinman, Under the Spreading UCC-Subordinations and Article 9, 7 B.C.Ind. & Com.L.Rev. 1, 25 n. 81 (1965)
N.Y. Uniform Commercial Code § 1--209 (McKinney Supp.1975) provides:
An obligation may be issued as subordinated to payment of another obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate his right to payment of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated. Such a subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor. This section shall be construed as declaring the law as it existed prior to the enactment of this section and not as modifying it.
A determination of the 'true nature' of plaintiffs' equitable rights cannot be avoided by adopting the concept of implied contract. '(I)mplied contract is a term used to define those situations and conditions which make it equitable and just in applying the equity powers of the court to establish and declare a lien where otherwise there might be no relief.' James v. Alderton Dock Yards, Ltd., 256 N.Y. 298, 303, 176 N.E. 401, 403 (1931)
Since we are reversing that portion of the judgment in which these damages are awarded, we need not consider appellant's argument that the procedure followed by the District Court was improper

TALLY, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR,
v.
CATHERINE McMASTERS, BY HER NEXT FRIEND, MANUEL YBARBA.
December Term, 1857
THIS case was brought up, by writ of error, from the District Court of the United States for the district of Texas.
The case is stated in the opinion of the court.
It was argued by Mr. Hale for the plaintiffs in error, and by Mr. Hughes for the defendant.
The principal question in the case was, whether Catherine McMasters was a citizen of Mexico or of Texas. The arguments of the counsel upon this point were as follows:
Mr. Hale's first point was this:
The District Court should not have sustained the demurrer to the plea to the jurisdiction pleaded by John R. Tally. It appeared by the allegations of that plea that the plaintiff was, at the time of the institution of the suit, a citizen of the State of Texas. The Constitution of the Republic of Texas declared that 'all persons (Africans, the descendants of Africans, and Indians, excepted) who were residing in Texas on the day of the declaration of independence, shall be considered citizens of the Republic, and entitled to the privileges of such.' (Const. Rep. Gen. Prov., sec. 10; Hart. Dig., p. 38.) And the incorporation of the Republic of Texas into the Union, 'on an equal footing with the original States in every respect,' necessarily onverted the citizens of the Republic of Texas into citizens of the State of Texas and of the United States. (Joint Resolution for annexing Texas to the United States, March 1, 1845, 5 Stat. at L., 797; act of Dec. 29, 1845, 6 Stat. at L., 1.) It follows, that any person who, within the meaning of the Constitution of the Republic, resided in Texas at the time of the declaration of independence, and continued thus to be a citizen of the Republic until the period of annexation to the United States, became thereby a citizen of the State of Texas, and was not competent to bring a suit, in the District Court of the United States, against other citizens of the same State. The only point which presents any difficulty is in relation to the meaning of the phrase, 'who were residing in Texas,' used in the Constitution of the Republic. There can be little doubt, however, that the framers of the Constitution intended this phrase to be equivalent to the corresponding one, 'who had their domicil in Texas,' and did not design to deprive of their citizenship those who were physically absent from the country. Many of the most respectable and deserving residents of Texas were not, personally, within the limits of the Republic at the date of the declaration of independence. They had been forced to leave the country, temporarily, by the advance of the Mexican army; they had accompanied their suffering families to the refuge offered by the United States, on the eastern bank of the Sabine; they had been sent on missions by the General Council, to arouse the sympathies of the Western States; they had returned to their former homes, to bring their wives and children, left there during hostilities, to the country now redeemed by their arms. The history and legal annals of Texas are filled with examples. (Yoakum's History of Texas, vol. II, pp. 34, 36, 118, 125, 175, 181; Ordinances of Gen. Council, pp. 52, 55, 56, 58; Republic v. Young, Dallam, 464; The State v. Skidmore, 5 Tex., 469; Russell v. Randolph, 11 Tex., 464-'6.) It could not be intended by the Constitution of the new State, then in need of citizens, and anxious to attract them, to disfranchise such persons by a rigorous and literal application of the term 'resident.' And this conclusion is confirmed by the established meaning of this term. (Lambe v. Smith, 15 Mees. and W., 434; Hylton v. Brown, 1 Wash. C. C. R., 314; Blanchard v. Stearns, 5 Met., 303; Crawford v. Wilson, 4 Barb., 522.) It is true that in some instances, especially in cases arising under attachment laws, it has been said that residence and domicil were not always equivalent terms, and that a citizen domiciliated in one State, might have a temporary residence in another. But these decisions were based entirely upon the consideration of the object and intention of the particular statutes which were then to be interpreted, and do not deny that in other statutes, having a more enlarged purpose, the two terms would be regarded as identical. Strictly speaking, the more fact of inhabitancy does not constitute a domicil; the intention of remaining must also exist; but it follows, from this very rule, that a domicil implies and presupposes a residence, and that one who had his domicil in the Republic of Texas, necessarily resided there—legally, if not physically. The position here assumed is strengthened by the fact, that at the time of the declaration of independence of Texas, the western portion of the new Republic was filled with the military forces and political adherents of the invader. It would be the height of absurdity to suppose that the framers of the Constitution designed to convert the troops and the supporters of Santa Anna, then actually within Texas, and with a literal residence in the country, into citizens of the revolutionary Government.
If, then, the Constitution of the Republic of Texas conferred citizenship upon those who had their domicil in the country at the time of the declaration of independence, it will follow that Catherine McMasters was a citizen of the Republic. It appeared by the allegations of the plea that the domicil of her birth or origin was in Texas, at the town of Goliad, and that domicil certainly continues until another is acquired. (Somerville v. Somerville, 5 Vesey, 787; Monro v. Monro, 7 Cl. and Fin., 876; Mascard de Prob. concl. 85, No. 1.) To acquire another domicil, an intention to abandon the domicil of origin must exist. (Monro v. Monro, 7 Cl. and Fin., 891.) And an absence of fifteen or twenty years is not in itself, without proof of such intention, sufficient to forfeit the original domicil. (Merlin, Repert. Domicile, § 2; Dalloz, Dict. Gen. Domicile, § 1, Nos. 9-13.) In the case of Sanint Germain, absent in India for forty-five years, it was decided that such absence, without proof of his intention to abandon his residence in France, did not divest him of his domicil. (Dalloz, Jur. Gen., vol. 6, pp. 383-'4.) The intention or animus, thus essential to the acquisition of a new domicil, must be a legal and disposing will, and the voluntary act of a mind capable in law of acting. It can only be evinced by a person sui juris. (Somerville v. Somerville, 5 Ves., 787; Guier v. O'Daniel & Young, note to 1 Binn., 349, 352.) And, a fortiori, an infant or child cannot be capable of such as intention. Nam infans, et qui infanti proximus est, non multum a furioso distat. (Inst. III, 19, 10.) A minor, without parents or legal tutor, can therefore never lose or abandon proprio marte the domicil of origin. (Story Confl. Laws, § 46, 506, note; 1 Burge Comm. Col. Law, 38, 39; Pothier, Cout. d'Orleans, Ch. 1, sec. 1, Nos. 12-18; ed. de Brugnet, vol. 1, p. 5; Desduitz de St. Pierre v. Revel, Sirey, 35, p. 2, 556.) And this principle has been repeatedly recognised in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Louisiana—a court the most conversant with such questions. (Robbins v. Weeks, 5 Mart. N. S., 379; Succession of M. J. Robert, 2 Rob. La. R., 435-'6.) It is true that the surviving father or mother, that is to say, the natural tutor, may change, at will, the domicil of the minor, and transfer it to a different country; (Potinger v. Wightman, 3 Mer., 67, 79;) but this power does not extend to a mere friend, or to a person assuming, without the direct authority of law, the custody of the minor's person. (Robbins v. Weeks, 5 Mart. N. S., 379.) These rules are well explained by J. Voet, in his Commentaries on the Pandects, (Lib. V, tit. I, No. 100,) where he says, 'Ut enim haud difficiliter admittendum sit minorennem non magis posse domicilium mutare quam contrahendo se obligare; tamen quemadmodum contrahere auctore tutore permissum ei est, itaque et domicilium cum patre matreve, tanquam tutelae ejus aut saltem educationi praeposita, tutoribus caeteris non contradicentibus, mutare nihil vetat.' It is because the authority of the tutor supplies the defect of legal capacity or volition in the minor, that the latter acquires the domicil to which he accompanies the guardian; but as the authority of the delegated or appointed tutor ceases when he removes beyond the limits of the country, (Johnstone v. Beattie, 10 Cl. and Fin., 42, 87, 113, 148,) only the natural guardian—the parent of the minor, whose power remains unimpaired—can change the domicil of his ward to a new country. (School Directors v. James, 2 Watts and S., 568, 572.) These principles are substantially recognised in the case of Hardy v. De Leon. (5 Tex., 234-'8.) Sylvester De Leon resided in Texas at the date of the declaration of independence; in 1838, he was removed by the military authorities of the country to Louisiana, where his son, Francisco Santiago De Leon, was born; the wife of Sylvester died; the family then removed to Tamaulipas, and children were left in the care of their grandmother, while Sylvester returned to Texas; after a short visit, he again went to Tamaulipas, with the intention of returning to Texas with his children, but was killed on the road. Francisco, his youngest son, however, came to Texas, and lived at Goliad; and in a suit commenced in his name, it was pleaded by the defendants that he was an alien enemy. The Supreme Court of Texas held that the plaintiff's father, Sylvester De Leon, had never lost his citizenship in Texas; and if he had, or if his citizenship did not attach to his infant son, born in Louisiana, still the domicil of origin, acquired by the birth of Francisco in Louisiana, could not be forfeited by his removal, during minority, and without his own volition, to Mexico.
The case made by the present plea in abatement is stronger than that of Hardy v. De Leon. Catherine McMasters was a child, less than five years of age, at the time of her removal from the domicil of her parents and of her own birth, in Texas, to a foreign country. Her parents were both dead; she had had no recognised tutor, nor has she been emancipated by marriage; she was removed by the family of Manuel Sabriego, with which she has continued to reside; and it does not appear that the family, which she thus accompanied, had any legal authority whatever to control her course in life, or decide on her domicil. It was incumbent on the plaintiff to have repelled the legal presumption arising from these facts, by a replication to the plea, and the demurrer should have been overruled.
These views are confirmed by a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Texas, made at Tyler, in 1857, in the case of Wheeler v. Hollis. (See manuscript opinion.) In the course of this decision, after referring to the doubt as to the general authority of a guardian to change the domicil of his ward, the court states its conclusion to be, that a mother is not deprived, by her second marriage, of the natural right of controlling the person of her child, and determining its future home; but that this power does not extend to the mere legal guardian, after the death of both parents, nor authorize the mother, even as natural guardian, to change the domicil of the child, to the injury of its interests or the forfeiture of its property. 'When an infant has no parents, the law, it is true, remits him to his domicil of origin or to the last domicil of his parents. But when he has a surviving mother, it is difficult to perceive the justice or propriety there would be in not permitting her to make her domicil that of her children.' 'In other communities, it may not be unusual for children, who have parents, to have others appointed their guardians; and then it may be truly said that the ward is not naturally or necessarily a part of the guardian's family;' 'and so it may be said where the ward has no parent.' And the court cites the opinion of Ch. J. Gibson in School Directors v. James, 2 W. and S., 568, with approbation, and affirms the rule, that 'whatever may be the power of the guardian over the person and property of the ward, he cannot exercise it so as to injure the ward himself. The very end and purpose of his office is protection, and there is no imaginable case in which the law makes it an instrument of injury by implication.' It is evident, from this decision, that Sabriego had no power to remove the infant plaintiff from the domicil of origin for any reason, much less to make such removal when it would work a forfeiture of the minor's lands in Texas.
This part of the case, however, can be put upon higher ground. The principles of the Spanish law, and not the law of nations or of nature, controlled the political rights of persons under both the Republics of Mexico and of Texas. The jurisprudence of Spain in relation to questions of citizenship was stirctly and perhaps too exclusively national in its spirit. It admitted of no divided allegiance; it suffered no expatriation from the native soil. The domicil of the origin fixed the political rights and duties of the subject and citizen forever. 'By law, no one can denaturalize himself.' (Part. II, 18, 29; Part IV, 24-'5.) And Aguila y Roxas, in his excel lent notes to his grandfather's treatise on the conflict of laws in relation to entailments, sums up the whole doctrine in this paragraph: 'Originarius hujus Regni, qui in aliud se transtulit, non amittit originem, quia quemadmodum patrem mutare non possumus, ita nec patriam: pro qua videndi qui hanc sententiam sequuntur, Bart. in L. Assumptio in princ. ff. ad Muncipal; Sozin. in cap. licet ratione ult. num. 52, de for. compet; Sanchez de Matrim lib. 3, disp. 23, num. 4; Barbos. in L.

(See Aguila y Roxas, Additae Quaest, P. III, ch. 1, no. 8; Notes of Greg. Lopez to Part. IV, 24-'5.) The political existence of Catherine McMasters was attached to the soil, and, in the language of Ciarlina above cited, she was mortgaged to it as her country. She might lose her rights of property by absence, or her civil privileges by disuse; but the Republic of Texas could not suffer her to sacrifice the political duties which wedded her to the country of her birth—much less allow a self-appointed guardian to sever this infant, without power or freedom of choice, from her natural mother.
Mr. Hughes:
I. This plea shows that plaintiff below did not reside in Texas at the day of the declaration of independence, but was then residing in Matamoras, or elsewhere in Mexico. And we would say that this settles the question, for a prima facie case, to say the least, is made, showing that she was not a citizen of the Republic.
The declaration of the Constitution of the Republic is, 'All persons (Africans excepted, &c.) who were residing in Texas on the day of the declaration of independence, shall be considered citizens of the Republic, and entitled to all the privileges of such.'—Const. of Rep., Gen. Prov., sec. 10, Hart. Dig., p. 38.
But, to avoid the effect of this provision, it is contended that the word 'residing,' in the connection it is found, should be construed the same as 'domicil;' and to show that there might be a domicil, without a continued actual residence, numerous authorities will no doubt be referred to—all of which, as before stated, will be admitted to be good law; but they do not meet the case. For it is manifest that the Convention which framed the Constitution did not intend to indicate 'domicil' by the language used; and the error, if error there be, in the premises or conclusions of counsel, is in supposing that only by virtue of the provision of the Constitution cited, was it declared who were citizens of Texas and who were not. We suppose the provision inserted was so inserted for the purpose of providing for a class of persons who, upon general principles, might not be citizens of the new Republic. There were and could not have been otherwise than great numbers of persons, within the limits of Texas, who had not become citizens, and all such it was intended to make citizens. This will appear from an examination of the other provisions of the same 10th section and other sections of the Constitution. But, again, had the word 'domicil' been used instead of 'residing,' there would have been something in the argument. Domicil does not necessarily indicate residence, for the authorities show, that though domicil may be accompanied with residence, it is not always so; but there may be domicil without actual residence. Residence does not always indicate domicil.
If it had been the intention to make a declaration which was to determine as to all persons who should be citizens of the Republic, some other term would have been used; but the use of the expression inserted shows that there might be other persons who were citizens, besides those provided for—those, for instance, who had been, and up to the day of the declaration of independence continued to be, citizens of the State of Coahuila and Texas, residing in Texas, but who might be temporarily absent from the State, on business of the country, &c.
Transient persons, however, were not provided for, as they should not have been. The Mexican army in the west spoken of, who came to subjugate Texas, being all transient, could not come within the language 'residing.'
This question will now be viewed in its true character, not as a mere question of domestic domicil, but in that more important, as a question of national character.
The plea shows that Catherine McMasters was, from the time of her birth up to about the age of four years, domiciled in Goliad, the place of her birth, but removed therefrom by those under whose charge she was, to Matamoras, before the declaration of independence. She then was a native Mexican, owing allegiance to the Republic of Mexico. When she was removed, a revolution had commenced, and was subsequently perfected by the declaration of independence. It will not be questioned, it is presumed, that after the close of the revolution, those who had participated in the struggle on either side, by reason of their adherence to Texas or to Mexico, were either Mexicans or Texans, as they adhered to the one side or the other. But how was it with others, who by no act of adherence had made an election? It has been contended for plaintiff in error, that this was settled by the domicil of each individual: if within Texas, then they were Texans; if in Mexico, then they were Mexicans. And in this particular, Catherine McMasters, being a minor, and incapable of will, though removed beyond the limits of Texas before independence was declared, did not forfeit the domicil of her birth, that of her parents, and was a Texan. When reasoning as to domicil, this may all be well enough; but, as before intimated, we are speaking of national character, under particular circumstances; and this, in the circumstances in which Catherine McMasters stood, depended on election. If she had remained in Texas, she would have been regarded as a Texan citizen. But having been removed to Mexico, she thereby adhered to Mexico, though she had no will on the subject; but being a minor, not having power to make an election, she had time until majority to make such election; and when made, she would be a citizen of that State to which she adhered; but in the mean time she could be considered in no other light than a citizen of Mexico. These principles have been recognised in this court, and applied to a case occurring during our revolution.
A native-born American, resident in New York, united himself to the English forces in possession of New York, and adhered throughout the struggle to the British side, and went off with the British forces, and died in the British dominions. His son, born in New York, was taken with him, and continued under his charge. This son afterwards claimed an estate by descent, and it was determined that he was an alien, and could not take by descent; and in delivering the judgment of the court, Mr. Justice Thompson says:  to be so him at that time.'
Again: 'The British doctrine therefore is, that the American ante nati, by remaining in America after the treaty of peace, lost their character of British subjects. And our doctrine is, that by withdrawing from the country and adhering to the British Government, they lost, or perhaps, more properly speaking, never acquired, the character of American citizens.'—Inglis v. The Sailors' Snug Harbor, 3 Peters, 122-'3.
And this is the case which shows the distinction between mere questions of domestic domicil and the more important questions as to national character. In the former, the question of domicil of a minor is settled by that of his father, or the last of the father, when he is dead; while in the latter, the national character depends upon election, whether the party be adult or minor, though the act of the father making his election may operate an election for the son, if his dissent be not made in due time.
But did Catherine McMasters either show a dissent or an election to become a Mexican, instead of a Texan? It will be seen, by an examination of the plea in question, that she was about four years of age when she was removed by Manuel Sabriego to Matamoras, before the declaration of independence, in March, 1836; she was therefore of age eighteen years afterwards, in the year 1853. We have no evidence of a dissent to the act of removal by Sabriego, or of an election to become a citizen of Texas; and upon the principles established in the case referred to in this court, it must be presumed that she ratified the act of her friend, and remained a citizen of Mexico, and was so by relation from the time of removal and the declaration. But the plea is contradictory in regard to the age of Catherine McMasters, for after the statement of her age before the declaration of independence, it is in another part alleged that she was a minor at the time of filing said plea in 1854. This matter of the age is material; and if the contradiction is to have effect at all, one averment destroys the other, and then there is no good plea, for the want of material averments.th-performance mean time, defence any one. (2 Cranch, 280; 4 ib., 209; 1 Dallas, 53; 20 Johns. R., 313; 3 Peters R., 99,. (3 Peters, 242; 2 J. Cas., 29.)
Assuming that the plaintiff is an alien, and not a citizen of Texas, the next question is, whether or not she is under any disability that would prevent her from the assertion of her title to the premises in question; in otherwords, whether her absence and alienage worked a forfeiture of the estate. The general principle is undisputed, that the division of an empire works no forfeiture of a right of property previously acquired. Kelly v. Hamson. (2 J. Cases, 29;as R., 495.
The defenceence, for saying that they were made without authority; and hence, altogether void. If voidable, for irregularity or other cause, the question was not one for a court of law in an action to recover possession, but for a court of equity to reform any error or mistake. (9 Peters, 632; 13 ib., 368-'9; 3 Wh., 212, 221; 7 How., 844.) We think a satisfactory answer might be given to the several objections taken to the survey and location; but we prefer to place it upon the ground above stated.
The judgment of the court below affirmed.

Will SEIDs be required for any non-employees?
Maybe. In order to document that all services and licensure requirements are met for accreditation purposes, the district may have to request SEID assignments for individuals who work under contracts performing services that help the district meet its accreditation requirements.
For example, certain special education services may be contracted from companies that employ the necessary licensed staff in a regional area. Those staff, although they are not district employees, would normally hold have an educator license or be licensed under a state board, so an SEID number would have been assigned to him or her.
OPI is still working on the details of how this situation will be documented for accreditation purposes.

moving on. growing up. and the confidence to say it.
i'll miss the corner cafe. the short trek to it. just one half of a block. the lattes that have become both ritual and story. i'll miss hector poking his head out from the kitchen to say hello in spanish. the granite bar and tiled floor, the ever-changing art adorning the walls. the quiet familiarity of the place.
i'll miss the wine store across the street. the one so large it feels out of place in manhattan. painted in colors that bring to mind the open air, mountains, and a drier climate.
i'll miss the way the light plays off the red-bricked building across the way. the building that each saturday men and boys enter into, through an unmarked door on the first floor. i'll miss the curiosity that parade elicits.
i'll miss the river. especially on those days it's so quiet and still, the air so clear, that i feel i can reach my thumb and forefinger to the opposing bank and drag it towards me. tangible. i'll miss the way the spring air angles against the bluffs, and the trees reborn, swaddled in green.
to be honest though, i've mostly stopped noticing it. the water. the green. the very thing i first fell in love with--i've mostly stopped seeing it. i didn't mean for that to happen. it just did.
surely i'll miss the eccentricities of this very small and very specific corner of manhattan--washington heights, hudson heights. so close to water, right up against no longer used train tracks. i'll feel nostalgic for this suspended moment in time in which i stumbled into womanhood.
but it's not enough. those things i love are simply not enough anymore..

You are SUCH a talented writer, I enjoy your posts each morning :)
xo, Amanda
You're making me miss all that, and I've never even seen it.
So, Brooklyn?
This is one of my favorites so far. Beautifully expressed. There is a lot of joy to be found in growing up.
Sheesh, this one hit home. Quoted some of you today on my own blog. You just described the past two years for me, conclusions it took me so long to get to, to resolve with.
"Stumbled into womanhood"; what a beautiful line! Good luck with the move- can't wait to read about the new place!
"no one tells you that one of the joys of getting older is the confidence in that phrase: not. good. enough."
thank you thank you thank you for this.
Holy Bananas that one made my heart flutter. You so eloquently described the grace I found (not very gracefully, may I add)in letting things go. Spending time where I want and not where everyone else wants me to. And my God does it feel good. And liberating. Love love love this one. Want to share it with so many of my lady friends that aren't blog-readers. I just love it. And one more love for good measure.
Beautiful! Absolutely beautiful. Love your blog!
~Tiffany
i swear, your blog is like the big sister i never had. all the advice. all the wisdom. just what i need.
The most important thing I learned the past year is that I can be grateful for what I have but still ask for more. It has been one of the most unexpected and liberating lessons. I hope it's one I never forget.
Also, I can't wait to find out which neighborhood is your next one!
excited to hear about your move!
good luck :)
yes, yes it does. love the ode to you neighborhood. my little place in nyc makes me feel the same way.
i have a dear friend who is an older man, and he gave me the mantra, "big girl, brave girl". i say it to myself from time to time.
looking forward to reading about your move!
You make so much sense.always. thank you so much for your words of wisdom.
i loved this. i'm in the throes of trying to decide if i should move to a new city or not, and struggling with emotional attachment to my current abode. i like this: "but it's not enough. those things i love are simply not enough anymore." ...and now i will listen to "beauty in walking away" by marie digby (acoustic version!) and do more pondering.
Today is one of those days where I feel going back and reading your posts will make me feel better. I was right. I felt this post in my heart, as I do with many of your posts. Please don't ever stop writing!

Abstract: Simulations with the Hadley Centre general circulation model (HadCM3), including carbon cycle model and forced by a 'business-as-usual' emissions scenario, predict a rapid loss of Amazonian rainforest from the middle of this century onwards. The robustness of this projection to both uncertainty in physical climate drivers and the formulation of the land surface scheme is investigated. We analyse how the modelled vegetation cover in Amazonia responds to (i) uncertainty in the parameters specified in the atmosphere component of HadCM3 and their associated influence on predicted surface climate. We then enhance the land surface description and (ii) implement a multilayer canopy light interception model and compare with the simple 'big-leaf' approach used in the original simulations. Finally, (iii) we investigate the effect of changing the method of simulating vegetation dynamics from an area-based model (TRIFFID) to a more complex size- and age-structured approximation of an individual-based model (ecosystem demography). We find that the loss of Amazonian rainforest is robust across the climate uncertainty explored by perturbed physics simulations covering a wide range of global climate sensitivity. The introduction of the refined light interception models leads to an increase in simulated gross plant carbon uptake for the present day, but, with altered respiration, the net effect is a decrease in net primary productivity. However, this does not significantly affect the carbon loss from vegetation and soil as a consequence of future simulated depletion in soil moisture; the Amazon forest is still lost. The introduction of the more sophisticated dynamic vegetation model reduces but does not half the rate of forest dieback. The potential for human-induced climate change to trigger the loss of Amazon rainforest appears robust within the context of the uncertainties explored in this paper. Some further uncertainties should be explored, particularly with respect to the representation of rooting depth.

We enjoyed a round of the traditional NBIA Xmas party drink, Irish Car Bombs. Yum!
TJ claims to know how to make a "perfect martini," so he became the bartender for awhile. People drinking martinis look fancy, so I decided to take some portraits.
It took about five seconds for the portraits to stop being fancy, thanks to Sean!
Payback!
TJ gave Billie a spanking.
And then they did Sunshine Arms!
Which is like a super amped up version of Jazz Hands, really.
TJ's perfect martini. He is an olive hater, so he insists on only putting one per cocktail.
I followed him around and treated people to additional olives. Because they are DELICIOUS.
Lori's portrait.
Rick. Cheers!
Tracy had the CUTEST little limoncello glasses. They're so fancy you just can't resist sticking your pinky out while you sip. Dainty!
This picture is blurry but I'm posting it anyway, because Elizabeth and I are being so fancy with our pinkies!
Tracy and Tina, our wonderful hostess and host!
Unicorn Pegasus time! Lori's first!
Billie!
TRACY LET ME DO A UNICORN PEGASUS ON HIS FACE!!!!! He is my new favorite person! Aaron Mather let me do one on his forehead once, which was also awesome. But this was the first full-on face unipeg.
Billie captured this great photo of Tracy and I both pointing and me yelling. We must have been passionate about something! Point point point!
It's glorious!
Face unipeg!
Then we got to shoot guns!!!!!! Best party ever!!! Tracy got Tina a super realistic BB gun that's just like one of the guns in the Bond movies.

ORANGE —
Jefferson County’s population showed slight gains while Orange County lost of people, according to U.S. Census figures released Thursday.
Statewide, Texas’ population is growing and the increase is most apparent among Hispanics which now accounts for 38 percent of the total population.
The census figures pertaining to Texas were released Thursday. More specific data for counties and cities down to the block is expected to be made available to the public Friday morning.
Preliminary results indicate Jefferson County’s population grew by about 200 while Orange County lost about 2,000 people because of Hurricanes Rita and Ike, Joe Deshotel, District 22 state representative, said Thursday in a telephone conversation.
Jefferson County’s population in 2000 was 252,051, according to 2000 Census results. Orange County’s population was 85,000.
Overall the state showed strong gains in population.
Non-Hispanic whites dropped to 45.3 percent and blacks make up 11.5 percent of Texas’ population, the Associated Press reported Thursday.
The detailed Census data will be used to redraw Congressional lines, and to figure federal funding which is distributed on a population basis.
Based on new census numbers, Texas is getting four new Congressional seats, more than any state in the nation. Because the growth is largely due to an increase in Hispanic population, Hispanic leaders say more Latino-dominated seats should redrawn as part of the redistricting process.
Deshotel said though he expects more Hispanic Congressman as a result, he is not sure the district lines will be drawn to reflect the growing Hispanic population.
“I expect there will be some lawsuits coming out of this,” Deshotel said. “The Mexican-American Legislature caucus will be of the opinion that the four new Congressional seats should be in Hispanic impact districts because that is where the growth change is, but I doubt that is what the Republicans have in mind. There will be litigation eventually.”
Republican House Speaker Joe Straus said he looked forward to passing “fair and legal maps that represent the make-up of Texas,” the AP reported.
It was anticipated that Jefferson County would lose population, not gain, Jeff Branick, Jefferson County Judge, said Thursday.
“I am glad the pundits forecasting we were going to lose population were proven wrong, but I’m still somewhat skeptical that we have a complete count. I’m still concerned we were undercounted,” Branick said.
If the county had lost people as was anticipated, Branick said there were worries it would have negatively impacted Congressional district lines.
Orange County Judge Carl Thibodeaux said county officials had anticipated a declining population.
“We’ve had two major storms, so I figured we were going to lose some population, but I didn’t know how much,” Thibodeaux said.
Orange County officials are awaiting final numbers and the impact the decline will have on the county.
In addition to the storms, Thibodeaux said hard economic times have contributed to the loss of population.
“People are moving out trying to find work. There are just a lot of issues, but the storms certainly did not help,” Thibodeaux said.
Statewide, Asians and other racial groups went up the most on a percentage basis, increasing by 58 percent. The black population went up by over 20 percent and Hispanics saw their strength rise by more than 42 percent, the AP reported.
In Harris County, new Census data indicates there are now 1.7 million Hispanics, accounting for 41 percent of the population. Non-Hispanic whites make up only a third of the county, while blacks account for 18.4 percent.
Projections show Hispanics will be the majority in Texas within nine years.
According to the latest Census data, Texas’ population of 25.1 million increased by more than 20 percent over the last decade. The number is more than twice the national rate of 9.7 percent.

This paper is a modeling of the rigid community or clan which the organizing core is a «hidden antagonism». The family beliefs cluster the members around a joint project related to appearing and to having it. But a subsystem develops and reintroduces a difference in this monolith. This subsystem is based on elements related to being and feeling, but also to ambiance, spirituality, aesthetics, suffering and pathology. This « hidden opposing » force dissimulated in the family « underground » remains unknown but works with an equal power to sustain the community unity. However, it uses radically different means than the dominating subsystem. Although each subsystem thinks it supports the system unity, it is more the conjunction of the two of them (in a hidden antagonism) that is the organizing principle of the clan. Cet article présente une modélisation du clan dont le principe organisateur est un « antagonisme caché ». Les croyances familiales unissent l'ensemble des membres autour d'un projet commun lié au paraître et à l'avoir. Mais un sous-système se construit, qui réintroduit une différence dans ce monolithe, à partir de valeurs proches de l'être et de l'éprouvé, des valeurs liées à l'ambiance, à la spiritualité, à l'esthétique, à la souf¬france et à la pathologie. Ce sous-système appelé «contestant caché », dissimulé dans le maquis familial, n'est reconnu par personne, et pourtant il agit avec autant de puissance que l'autre sous-système appelé « dominant», pour soutenir l'unité de la communauté, mais par des moyens radicalement opposés à ceux du sous-système «dominant». <br />Le processus organisateur du clan est donc animé par un antagonisme caché entre deux sous-systèmes dont chacun tente d'imposer ses propres moyens de produire l'unité, alors que le clan se nourrit de leur lutte sous-jacente.

Summary: Parentification – infantilization. The individuation process of Anne’s mother. – The research on the double bind context helps us understand the individuation process of mothers who are described as parentified and whose child seems to present borderline or psychotic problems. In a previous paper, we presented a study on double bind between those mothers and their child. This aim of this present paper is to develop the transgenerational aspects of those family patterns. The paper will describe the individuation process of the parentifed mother based on the position she had in her own family, the way she grew up and progressively developed. We will examine her functions towards each of her parents and as well as towards her sibling. We will focus on different elements such as contact style, patterns of interaction in the creation of an «experiencing world» that is so crucial in double bind process. This paper is the last of four. Their all tried to expand the area of double bind by clarifyinging the Bateson’s metaphor about the double bind as the only visible part of an iceberg. Further than a logical conceptual organization for double bind patterns, the aim of this paper is to provide therapists with a methodological tool they could use as a map which is co-created with the family to progressively reveal the good reasons for this pathological situation to be and question its pertinence in the family today.

BACKGROUND: Thymectomy is considered as an effective therapeutic option for patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). This study reports the experience of our centre's investigation into the efficacy and the safety of the procedure and the influence of different pre-operative factors on the surgical outcome. METHODS: A retrospective chart review/interview was made of 19 consecutive patients who underwent extended transsternal thymectomy for MG from 1992 to 2003. The severity of the disease was determined according to the Osserman Classification. Efficacy was measured by determining the change in clinical status, the rate of remission during follow-up, and the reduction in medication requirements after thymectomy. Complete remission (CR) was defined as asymptomatic off medication for 6 months. The CR rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meyer method. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients at surgery was 34 years (range, 9-63) and 78.9% were female. Mean length of follow up was 86 months (range, 24-163). The overall complication rate was 10.6% (1 episode of atrial fibrillation and a left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy that resolved after the first postoperative month). There was no operative mortality. The mean hospital stay was 9.4 days (range, 5-23). The crude CR rate was 32% (n = 6). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of CR was 42% at 6 years. Age, gender, duration of symptoms, thymic histology, Osserman stage and the presence of thymoma were not identified as prognostic variables. The average daily dose of Medrol and Mestinon decreased significantly between the pre-operative period and the last follow-up (Medrol, p = 0.0081; Mestinon, p = 0.0013). CONCLUSIONS: Transsternal thymectomy for MG is safe and effective. It benefits patients with MG at all stages. Patients with thymoma are not associated with poorer remission rates. Complete responses are durable, as the CR rate remains stable over time. -i.e., 6 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 Escherichia coli, 1 Citrobacter freundii, and 1 Enterobacter cloacae strain-was beta beta-lactamases produced by the 12 tranconjugants turned out to be SHV-12 by DNA sequencing.

[more ▼]ix superfamilies exhibit different effector-binding domains (EBDs) fused to a DNA-binding domain with a common feature. In a previous study of the GntR superfamily, we demonstrated that classifying members into subfamilies according to the EBD heterogeneity highlighted unsuspected and accurate TF-binding site signatures. In this work, we present how such in silico analysis can provide prediction tools to discover new cis/trans relationships. The TF-binding site consensus of the HutC/GntR subfamily was used to (i) predict target sites within the Streptomyces coelicolor genome, (ii) discover a new HutC/GntR regulon and (iii) discover its specific TF. By scanning the S.coelicolor genome we identified a presumed new HutC regulon that comprises genes of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) specific for the uptake of N-acetylglucosamine (PTSNag). A weight matrix was derived from the compilation of the predicted cis-acting elements upstream of each gene of the presumed regulon. Under the assumption that TFs are often subject to autoregulation, we used this matrix to scan the upstream region of the 24 HutC-like members of S.coelicolor. orf SCO5231 (dasR) was selected as the best candidate according to the high score of a 16 bp sequence identified in its upstream region. Our prediction that DasR regulates the PTSNag regulon was confirmed by in vivo and in vitro experiments. In conclusion, our in silico approach permitted to highlight the specific TF of a regulon out of the 673 orfs annotated as 'regulatory proteins' within the genome of S.coelicolor. [less ▲]

The transcription factor NF-kappa B plays a key role in a wide variety of cellular processes such as innate and adaptive immunity, cellular proliferation, apoptosis and development. In unstimulated cells, NF-kappa B is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its tight association with inhibitory proteins called I kappa BS, comprising notably I kappa B alpha. A key step in NF-kappa B activation is the phosphorylation Of I kappa B alpha by the so-called I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex, which targets the inhibitory protein for proteasomal degradation and allows the freed NF-kappa B to enter the nucleus where it can transactivate its target genes. The IKK complex is composed of two catalytic subunits called IKK alpha and IKK beta, and a regulatory subunit called NEMO/IKK gamma. Despite their key role in mediating I kappa B alpha phosphorylation in the cytoplasm, recent works have provided evidence that IKK subunits also translocate into the nucleus to regulate NF-kappa B-dependent and -independent gene expression, paving the way of a novel and exciting field of research. In this review, we will describe the current knowledge in that research area. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. [less ▲]

Benefits of Hyaluronic Acid
Benefits of Hyaluronic Acid
Introduction
Hyaluronic Acid (Hyaluronic Acid or Sodium Hyaluronate) has many benefits and is one of the most interesting ingredients in skin care. Naturally found in the body, hyaluronic acid secures moisture and creates fullness—youthful skin naturally abounds with hyaluronic acid. In skin care, you can find hyaluronic acid creams, serums, injectables (aka: Restylane), and HA supplements.
Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan (polysaccharides that are an important component of connective tissue). HA is distributed widely throughout connective, neural, and epithelial tissue. It is of the chief components of the extra-cellular matrix (the tissue that provides structural support to cells). In short, HA supports many important areas of the body, including beauty and skin.

83% of users said they saw improvement in skin texture, skin moisture, and reduction in wrinkles.
Benefits of Hyaluronic Acid as an Oral Supplement
Hyaluronic acid, as it remains supple and resistant to wrinkles and fine lines.
Effectiveness of oral Hyaluronic Acid supplementation has been somewhat controversial. There have been studies2,3 showing hyaluronic acid to be extremely effective with oral supplementation. Theories abound on if the Hyaluronic Acid is actually directly affecting the outcome, or if it is an indirect effect due to higher blood levels (proven due to the supplementation), serving as the raw material for the body to draw upon to increase extra-cellular hyaluronic levels.
The Bottom Line
Hyaluronic Acid supplementation was directly correlated to measured increases in skin moisture. Microscopic skin surface analysis shows increased skin smoothness, and amelioration of wrinkles. Elavonne's Amino Collagen C with Hyaluronic Acid provides 50mg of pure hyaluronic acid plus 5,000 mg of fish peptide collagen—an advanced anti-aging supplement for improved hair, skin, and nails.
Based on our knowledge of the function of hyaluronic acid and mechanisms (and the growing research), it looks like hyaluronic acid will remain one of the most exciting and interesting nutrients for natural skin care for the foreseeable future..

The impact of computer-mediated interaction on distance learning.
British Journal of Educational Technology, 39(1),
pp. 52–70.
Distance-learning courses were classified with regard to their use of computer-mediated interaction and the degree to which such interaction was integrated into the curriculum and the assessment regime. This produced four groups of courses varying according to their use of interaction and integration. The impact of interaction and integration was investigated in terms of their effects on students' performance, their perceptions of academic quality and their approaches to studying. In all three respects, variations within the groups of courses proved to be more important than variations between the groups. Interpretation of these results suggests that the adoption of interactive environments within computer-mediated learning may not be enough in itself to lead to positive learning outcomes. We found no evidence for this assumption in terms of students' completion rates, pass rates, grades, perceptions of the quality of their courses or approaches to studying. Large variations in the measured indicators were found between courses, and these appeared to be largely independent of the effects of interaction and integration. Courses may differ markedly with regard to how they make use of computer-mediated interaction and how this is integrated into the curriculum and the assessment regime. A case study approach is suggested as being more likely to identify the impact of specific designs based on computer-mediated interaction and to bring together the diverse student responses arising from the use of such interaction in their studies.

In the late 1960s, a group of Russian Orthodox faithful joined the Russian Orthodox Church of Hawaii and formed the St. Mark of Ephesus Russian Orthodox Mission Parish. there are plans to build the first Russian Orthodox church in Honolulu.
Fr. Anatole also oversees the Russian Orthodox mission communities on Kauai and the Big Island of Hawaii.
The Russian Orthodox Church in Hawaii is under the spiritual care of Archbishop +KYRILL of San Francisco, the current successor of Archbishop +TIKHON of San Francisco of blessed memory. Archbishop +TIKHON was Archbishop of San Francisco when Fr. Innokenty Dronov oversaw the Russian Orthodox Church in Hawaii in the 1940s.

In my last post I discussed two models of communication used within software communities, mailing lists and web forums. However, over the past few years, a new model has arisen: Stack Exchange.
The name is a play on Stack Overflow, the first site to use the software which powers Stack Exchanges. The system was developed by Stack Exchange Inc. (SEI) who maintain and host the software, as well as running several Stack Exchanges themselves. While similar in aspects to web-based forums, a Stack Exchange is markedly different, bringing in elements from other Internet media. Discussion threads are replaced with simple question-and-answers on a well-defined topic. Users can up or down-vote questions and answers, and the user who asked the question can “accept” one answer to indicate which successfully answered their question. There’s no sign up required to view existing questions, and all Stack Exchange sites use OpenID, so you can probably log in with an existing account.
Stack Exchanges are designed to be run by the community, and be largely self-moderating. Users who ask good questions and provide good answers are rewarded with reputation points. As a user accumulates points, they gain accessed to more privileged functionality.
To help keep sites on-topic, each Stack Exchange also has a “meta” sub-site, for questions about the site itself.
This unique combination of factors helps ensure that well worded and presented questions are highly visible, while vague or off-topic posts are less so. Similarly, the best answer to a question is quickly accessible, as it will appear first.
Take to the Floor
There have been some great examples of Open Source projects making use of Stack Exchanges. Android’s main support channel for developers is via questions tagged with “Android” on StackOverflow.com. Stack Overflow is an existing Stack Exchange website specifically for programming questions. Tags allow questions to be categorised, and a user can favourite or ignore certain tags, as well as subscribing to an RSS feed for each tag. By tapping in to this existing system, Android gains a great platform for developer support, as well as exposing its development questions to the wider community, creating the potential to draw others in.
Roll Your Own
Working within existing sites isn’t the only option. The Ubuntu community have set up their own site, AskUbuntu.com, to provide a place for questions and answers about the Ubuntu operating system. The site has been a big success, become the one of if not the largest site (it depends how you measure it) the in the Stack Exchange network that isn’t run by SEI.
Marco Ceppi is a community-elected moderator at Ask Ubuntu. Ubuntu had several community support channels when Ask Ubuntu started, but the Stack Exchange model offered something different.
From day one I knew that precise Q&A like that of Stack Overflow is needed in the Ubuntu Community. I’d hardly used Launchpad Answers [an existing site for Ubuntu Q&A] because of low search engine rankings, Ubuntu Forums were and are still great, but I remember some very late nights reading huge threads just trying out solutions every other page to find that they’re obsolete and a new solution was just a few pages away. Forums are great for people who use and track the forums constantly. Ask Ubuntu is more for those people who have a problem, go to a search engine, then click a link and expect a fix. On Ask Ubuntu questions are constantly being filtered by the community and answers are voted on, making sure the most relevant and accurate answers is the next thing you read after the question. Ask Ubuntu really benefits the 90% of the people who visit the site and just want an answer.
Ask Ubuntu was first proposed by Evan Dandrea through the Stack Exchange Area 51 website, a system to take a community through the process of defining and committing to a new Q&A site, then running beta phases before it goes live. Marco says there was some resistance at first, but has since been fully accepted by the community.
At first there was a lot of resistance by other Ubuntu support groups, where they feared Ask Ubuntu might just swing in and knock them out of commission, or something like that. It wasn’t really clear why there was this animosity towards Ask Ubuntu.
Where we are today and where we were when we launched are two completely different sites. Now we’re accepted as a source of support by the community, you can even see bits and bobs of Ask Ubuntu “Ask a question” buttons on the Ubuntu project sites. We try to work with teams within Ubuntu to show them how they can monitor their software tag in AU and respond to enquiries. A few Ubuntu projects recommend Ask Ubuntu for community support. As far as success within Stack Exchange, we’re constantly butting up against the top three sites (Stack Overflow, Super User, Server Fault) in questions/day, traffic, and other site statistics.
Ask Ubuntu is also the only support channel mentioned in the Ubuntu installer as the place for new users to get help, which Marco says is a pretty good indicator of the site’s standing within the Ubuntu project.
What’s the Catch?
There are of course drawbacks to consider. Stack Exchange isn’t software you can licence and install yourself, it’s a hosted solution. If SEI were to go away, so would your site. If they were to be acquired by another company with different views on how to monetise the system, the nature of Stack Exchanges might change. However, SEI made a smart decision to require all contributions to be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licence and provide a tool for extracting this data, so if the worst was to happen, you’d be fully within your rights to reproduce the content elsewhere.
The OSS Watch team have experience working with communication tools in a number of Open Source communities. If you’re working in a UK college or university and need advice on the right tools to help build a community around your project, get in touch. Thanks to Marco Ceppi for taking the time to chat with me.

Turkey Shoots Itself in the Foot Over Nevruz
March 18, 2012 § 3 Comments
Nevruz, which is the Turkish name for the Persian New Year (traditionally celebrated the first day of spring) has caused all sorts of headaches for successive Turkish governments. It is a day that is celebrated by Kurds, leading to increased Kurdish nationalism and sometimes to PKK violence, both of which the Turkish government wants to avoid. In fact, Nevruz has been so controversial in the past that its celebration was actually banned in the mid-90s following demonstrations and police shooting and killing civilians in 1992. This year, controversy swirled again after the pro-Kurdish BDP announced that it would be celebrating Nevruz this year on March 18 rather than March 21 since Sunday festivities would get more people into the streets, and Turkish provincial governors responded by ordering celebrations to take place on March 21 as usual.
The reasoning behind forbidding Nevruz celebrations today was to minimize excessive shows of Kurdish nationalism, but as was entirely predictable, the move backfired terribly. The BDP refused to back down, police in Diyarbakır and Istanbul ended up using tear gas and water cannons on crowds that gathered to celebrate/protest, and BDP member in Istanbul was killed during the clashes (rumored to be a Kurdish politician).
Two quick thoughts on this, one specific to today’s events and one more general. First, having state officials attempt to dictate when a non-state holiday is to be celebrated is nothing more than foolish and guaranteed to lead to trouble. Ankara is understandably wary of PKK violence on Nevruz and of louder calls for Kurdish autonomy, but attempting to designate an official day on which festivities can be held is always going to be a losing proposition. There was no doubt that Kurds were going to fill the streets, and that police equipped with crowd control devices trying to stop them would lead to injuries and possibly fatalities. What was the potential upside to doing things this way? Now pro-Kurdish politicians get to loudly proclaim that Turkey’s actions make it a “fascist state” and Kurdish nationalism gets a larger boost than it otherwise would, obviating the very purpose of trying to eliminate a Sunday Nevruz observance.
Second, this type of stuff is going to keep on happening until Turkey finds a genuine solution to its Kurdish problem. Kurdish nationalism is not going to disappear, and the 15-20% of Turkey’s population that is ethnically Kurdish is not going to all of a sudden embrace the Kemalist narrative of “we are all Turks.” Erdoğan’s brief Kurdish opening was a start, but he quickly reversed himself and now again has gone back to trying to sweep the issue of Kurdish nationalism and identity under the rug. Until the government has an open and honest conversation about what to do with its Kurdish population in the long term, Nevruz is going to continue to be a day of violence rather than an innocuous festival heralding the end of winter.
I Wonder What Rick Perry Would Say
March 16, 2012 § Leave a Comment
The helicopter crash in Afghanistan that killed 12 Turkish soldiers is a sobering but important reminder that Turkey is not run by “Islamic terrorists” but is a member of NATO and an ally of the United States supporting the mission in Afghanistan. The fact that anyone with such a high level of ignorance about basic foreign affairs was deemed fit at one point to run for president is just staggering. Plenty of people take issue with aspects of Turkish foreign policy, but it is somehow overlooked by far too many casual observers that Turkey has been in NATO since 1952, hosts the 39th Air Base Wing of the U.S. Air Force at Incirlik, and is a linchpin of American strategy in the Middle East.
A Turkish Buffer Zone
March 15, 2012 § Leave a Comment
This report is interesting, as it opens up a possibility that would have been entirely unlikely months ago. If Turkey actually goes through with establishing a buffer zone inside Syria, it will be welcomed by those who are advocating intervention as it will move Turkey away from rhetorical support of the Syrian opposition and refugee assistance to active military action against the Assad government. I would be a bit surprised if it happens though, as it will make it easier for PKK fighters to slip through the cracks since there will be a larger border area to cover, and recent Turkish airstrikes and cross-border raids into northern Iraq indicate that Turkey’s willingness to risk a larger PKK presence inside its borders is slim.

We are excited to announce that the new 2012 Savor the Season Crops have been selected!
The new crops to be featured in 2012 will be:
Spinach
Arugula
Snow Peas
Rhubarb
Basil
Bell Peppers
Garlic
Spaghetti Squash
Turnips
Pumpkins
These crops were selected by asking market farmers and managers, through a survey, which crops they felt should be prioritized. After analyzing the results of the survey, members of the Savor the Season Advisory Committee (a group made up of eight specialty crop professionals) made the final crop selections.
As previously reported here, the Kansas Rural Center was awarded a Specialty Crop Block Grant from the Kansas Department of Agriculture in October that will help expand and develop the 2012 Savor the Season program. Collaborators for the project include Our Local Food, K-State Research and Extension, Kansas Vegetable Growers Association, Kansas Master Food Volunteers, and KSRE’s Rapid Response Center to name a few.
The goals of the 2012 Savor the Season Program are to 1.) Improve the diversity of specialty crops grown, and 2.) Increase sales of these crops in Kansas. To achieve these goals, the Savor the Season program will offer farmers educational programming and resources on the production and marketing of specific fruits and vegetables. Participating markets and farmers will receive attractive marketing tools such as colorful recipe cards that support consumer outreach. The program will also communicate with consumers the ease and benefits of eating from this diverse list of healthy, locally-grown specialty crops through materials (such as the colorful recipe cards) and events.
The Savor the Season Program was developed in 2009 and continued in 2010 with support from a KDA Specialty Crop Block Grant. To date, sixteen specialty crops have been featured including acorn squash, green beans, beets, bok choy, cantaloupe, chard, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, heirloom tomatoes, lettuce, napa cabbages, okra, onions, salad mix, sugar snap peas, and sweet potatoes. For more information, click here for aprogram retrospective.
More information on how your market or farm stand can participate in the 2012 Savor the Season program will be available in January. Check back on this blog or Facebook at facebook.com/SavorTheSeason. For questions, contact Natalie Fullerton or Mercedes Taylor-Puckett.
Happy growing & eating in 2012!

Just south of Stanley Park’s beaches, which are also quite scenic and enjoyable, English Bay Beach runs from the foot of Denman Street south about a kilometer to Sunset Beach, and although it’s a short stroll from the Davie Street gay scene and thus hugely popular with LGBT sun-worshippers, it’s actually a favorite hangout of most Vancouverites. You’ll find lots to do here, from sand volleyball to cavorting on a huge waterslide. At Sunset Beach, you can drop by the Vancouver Aquatic Centre for a swim (the GLBT English Bay Swim Club meets here) or catch the water taxi to Granville Island. Beach Avenue from Denman to Burrard Streets.
Wreck BeachFree
Location: SW Marine Drive, just north of University Boulevard Get Directions
Perched on the tip of Point Grey on the west edge of the University of British Columbia campus, Vancouver’s secluded clothing-optional strand is infamous for its “anything goes” vibe. Several trails lead down through the forest of pines, oaks, and cedars to Wreck Beach, with Trails 6 and 7 being the best for reaching the gay section, which is at the southern end of the beach toward the mouth of the Fraser River. Enterprising vendors selling everything from beer and sushi to various illicit substances are all around, especially near the base of Trail 6.

October means scary movies, pumpkin-flavored everything, decorative scarves, creative costumes, and most importantly, and obviously for this post, National Book Month. It’s the feel good month. The “Hey, it’s almost winter, but we’re not going to think about that right now” month. I’m excited for so many things, including this year’s costume, but alas that is for another post. Instead let’s talk about books. Here’s my list of most anticipated titles for October, in honor of National Book Month.
The Marriage Plot by Jeffrey Eugenides: Eugenides is my sail in a sea of pages. He’s the writer who gets down deep and gets your soul. A wordsmith at the very least, he knows how to perfectly surmise the human condition. So of course, I am going to read his dissertation on marriage. Meet Madeline, a disenfranchised beatnik of the 80s falling in love and lust with two very different suitors who make her question everything she’s ever known. Eugenides calls on the likes of Updike, Cheever and even Austen to explain exactly why it is we fall in love.
10th Grade by Joe Weisberg: High school was in a word, painful. You learn more in those four years about yourself then you ever will anywhere else. It’s what I like to call the suffering years. For those of you who think you had a
glorious, made-for-TV-movie existence, you didn’t. High school is where you feel everything for the first time and even the best moments change you forever, because no matter what, that intensity, that-end-of-the-world angst, fades over time. Revisit those suffering years with 15-year-old Jeremiah Reskin, who explains it the best way any kid can, with heartbreaking honesty.
Damned by Chuck Palahniuk: Welcome to Hell. To your left you will find the Desert of Dandruff and after that be sure to note the Mountain of Toenail Clippings. It’s Palahniuk’s version of Hell, so I can safely assume he probably nailed it on the head. His narrator is 13, dead, and desperate to get the heck out. She makes friends with the most perfect collection of sinners: a cheerleader, a jock, a nerd and a punk rocker. It’s the “Breakfast Club” meets “The Prince of Darkness” with a doozy of an opening line: “Are you there Satan? It’s me, Madison.”
Dearly Departed by Lia Habel: Alright, normally I don’t buy into the whole Young Adult romance series thing. I don’t get all fan-girl over anything; it requires too much energy. However, I might have posted on a forum in all caps about this particular series. A girl falls in love with a zombie! A zombie! It’s also set in the future in some Neo-Victorian period where everyone is prim, proper and corset-ed. Perfect.

That's the Spirit: In Steinbeck's Wake to Espiritu Santo, BC, Mex
It can take some time (in this case, about a year and a half) for conference-related work to filter through to mainstream publications. But here, better late than never, in the largest-circulation inflight mag in the biz, we get OWAC's David Page floating in a kayak in the Sea of Cortez, considering the distance between Isla Espiritu Santo and La Paz.

I infused with the joy and God-saturated nature characteristic of resources from the world of Sovereign Grace. If you’re a woman wondering what Christian homemaking looks like, you could not do better for a blog-based resource than Girltalk.
Chesterton’s excellent commentary on the dignity and importance of homemaking, the vocation Christians believe stems from the apostle Paul’s comment referring to young women “working at home” (Titus 2:5) :
“[Woman is surrounded]….”
“[W]hen as I say, I give it up; I do not know what the words mean…. I can understand how this might exhaust the mind, but I cannot imagine how it could narrow it. How can it be a large career to tell other people’s children .”"
************
Over against cultural derision toward homemaking, a mammoth literary figure affirms the vocation as hugely important. People can speak as they wish, but in my home, the domestic work of motherhood and homemaking will never, ever be spoken of in derogatory terms. How, after all, can I or my family call unholy what the Bible teaches is sacred? My wife does not despise this calling, and neither, I pray, will my daughter.
Of course, when you consider Chesterton’s words and the actual responsibilities of a homemaker, you’ll struggle not to underemphasize the importance of mothering and work around the house but to avoid overemphasizing it! Those who deride this work, in the end, seem to have less information about what it actually entails than do so many of the women I know. As I said recently in a sermon on 1 Timothy 2:11-15, I am called on a daily level to nurture my email account. My wife, on the other hand, is called to nurture a life, a soul, a person with an eternal existence.
Over against what the culture teaches us, does a Christian woman’s work seem weightless and frivolous? You tell me.
One Response to Homemaking Is Not Drudgery (Just ask G. K. Chesterton)
Good comments. I’ll have to take a look at this site and probably pass it on to several ladies.

- Hou (11-5). With Slaton, Owen Daniels, Andre Johnson and the quietly good Kevin Walter, it won’t take miracles from Matt Schaub to score points this year. But the key could be a quality defense. Even though Dunta Robinson (who just ended his holdout) will no doubt suffer the holdout-hamstring-pull soon that will dog him all season, the Houston defense has some high quality players. Mario Williams, DeMeco Ryans, Brian Cushing, (and a healthy Dunta) make for a solid young nucleus. This is Houston’s year in the AFC South.
- Indy (10-6). Funny I hadn’t read anything until yesterday about Bob Sanders being injured again. He’s apparently expected to miss several early games (through week 5 some say). This is significant. As much as Manning and the offense may do to put up points, the D could struggle to contain offenses like Houston.
- Tenn (8-8). I think this team overachieved last year. While I am rooting hard for new defensive coordinator Chuck Cecil (yes, the bridge of his nose is still bleeding), I think the loss of Jim Schwartz could spell some trouble for their D. I was going to put them below .500 but Jeff Fisher just seems to figure out how to win sometimes.
- Jax (5-11). This team is tough to predict. I believe I’ve been way off on them the last 3 years. This team seems to revolve around Maurice Jones-Drew in part, I think, because it does revolve around him. In fact, I’m having a hard time writing about anyone else. Sure, there’s Torry Holt, and Troy “he’s turned the corner, seriously…seriously” Williamson…ok, I’m just bored writing this…they’ll be weak.

Our journey to excellence is a road that can take a variety of twists and turns, but in the end our eyes are always focused on patients first. With this in mind, there still is a primary challenge—health care reform payments.
Why — Most businesses today are continuously seeking ideas about how to serve customers better with the ultimate goal of having such wonderful satisfaction from customers, they probably wouldn’t go anywhere else for that same service. PAHCS is truly no different as far as wanting to hear from our patients; however, we don’t have a choice of how we go about getting the information.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (federal program) has mandated that every patient who is hospitalized across this country will receive the same survey. In the past, there has been the opportunity to customize the survey by adding to the standard mandated questions a couple of additions such as “did you find parking conveniently” that were specific to that facility. Today, the same set of questions is being sent to every patient and reported nationally. Why? The federal government has decided that payment for services will be impacted based on the results of a facility’s surveys. We are being told that within the next year, poor performing hospitals will have dollars reduced from their payment for services provided if scores fall below certain target levels. At this time, we don’t know a dollar amount or if our organization will have some protection as a critical access hospital. Through several years of study, the federal government has determined that patients who are happy and satisfied with service have likely received better care and have better outcomes than those patients who describe their experience poorly. While we all could probably find arguments regarding this methodology, we are required to follow the same procedure as every other hospital across the country who provides services to individuals covered by Medicare and Medicaid. Conducting the surveys does come with a cost since we need to have the actual survey conducted by an outside vendor who then reports our scores to a national data base.
More than ever before we need everyone who receives a survey to complete it; we need to hear what we have done well and where it is we have opportunity to improve. Our internal quality department can look at results continuously as the company receives completed surveys. This allows us to be able to address in a timely manner what it is we need to do to improve.
Tami Stanger and Pam Boettcher team up to analyze our results, make recommendations for areas to improve and assist me in communicating the results to our Board of directors.
These surveys are just one of several changes that are being made at the federal level related to reimbursement. Our commitment stays consistent and strong—doing the right thing, at the right time, at the right place and focused on each and every patient. If you are surveyed—we would appreciate you completing the form. We can’t improve on things we don’t know and we wouldn’t want to change anything you tell us that we are doing well.

You're Invited To A Christmas Celebration
By: Eyewitness News
Updated: November 29, 2012
Stroudsburg, Monroe County - The Stroudsmoor Country Inn is hosting its annual Christmas tree lighting celebration Sunday.
Bakers are putting the final touches on a giant gingerbread village. More than 150,000 lights are ready to sparkle. And the Stroudsmoor staff is setting the scene for a live Nativity.
Employees at the Stroudsmoor Country Inn have spent months preparing for the celebration. Landscape Manager Jason Witcraft said, "We actually begin in the end of October and we just finish the day before the event."
The tradition started nearly 30 years ago. Inn Keeper Linda Forte told Eyewitness News it was originally just a family gathering. She said, "It started with a very small tree for our very young children who are now all off in college."
Twenty-four years ago her family eventually started inviting the community. All are welcome to enjoy a day full of festivities.
The staff has invented some cheery holiday drinks to help you celebrate. There are Gingerbread Martinis for the adults. And kids will enjoy s'mores concoctions or chocolate caramel milk.
Enjoy sipping a sweet treat and sharing family moments this Sunday.
While the event is free, Stroudsmoor asks that you bring a toy for the Toys for Tots program.
There will also be opportunities to donate to the Salvation Army.
For more information visit or call 570-421-6431.

(NSDQ: MSFT) has 50 handset partners. (NSDQ: PALM), Motorola (NYSE: MOT) and Samsung, have sold a 10 million phones all combined.
Full coverage at our Mobile World Congress channel
>>> …The next conclusion to make is that the other 49 OEM partners, including
>>> Palm, Motorola and Samsung, have sold a 10 million phones all combined.
Well…HTC is an ODM for…ALL of those guys? (Certainly Palm). So what "they" sell is what HTC sells…might cause a little double counting to say the 40 million HTC sales AREN'T included in whatever, say, Palm sells.
They are definitely a great partner that needs to be valued.
Actually, raleigh, most of those companies make their own phones. HTC does not do OEM work for Motorola, and Palm has its own manufacturing partners. Samsung also manufacturers their own phones.
You could find this out easily, if you looked.
Why doesn't Microsoft just buy HTC and make Windows-branded phones? Or Zune-branded phones? Or Xbox-branded phones? Isn't it a lot of work to try and make Windows Mobile hardware-agnostic and then it ends up running on HTC 80% of the time anyway?
I think Microsoft's old school idea about hardware and software being entirely separate is way, way out of date. The Web browser and the touch screen create "hardware buttons" on-the-fly out of software. In a sense, modern hardware is done half in hardware and half in software. The hardware company has to have half hardware engineers and half software engineers, all working on making hardware.
The 40 million phones that Microsoft+HTC have created over the last decade (which is less than the iPhones Apple sold in the past 2 years) would have been much better if one hand had known what the other was doing.
@Hamranhansenhansen:
I think Microsoft likes the very high profit margins on software compared to hardware. For example, despite its relatively high mindshare, Xbox isn't a great profit-maker for Microsoft. At the time the precursor to Windows mobile was decided, the financial situation of Apple wasn't a great argument for vertical integration (it wasn't an argument either way, really, but that didn't matter at the time) and the explosive success of Win32 variants seemed like it would have an encore on mobile platforms.
Now, I suspect Microsoft is really hampered by its mobile OS history. Windows mobile is poorly designed in general, but in particular it has been incrementally grown from a platform intended for much weaker architectures than current smartphones, which makes an originally poor design so much worse today. They might be technologically better off starting from the to-be-Windows-7 sources, but I'm sure that's got some baggage too, and it would alienate various partners (though that might be less of an issue as they flock to alternatives).
(I don't think Apple has hit the 40-million-iPhones mark yet. They've done impressively well, but not _that_ well…)
Windows Mobile is not that great. We are on target to sell 55Million phones before we ditch it for Windows Mobile 8 1/2 … it will be great. It may even get an Academy Award for Best Bad Actor in a drama.
'Apple's platform will grow stronger and maintain huge advantages over competitors as long as there continues to be one iPhone OS version for all handsets from all carriers. Apple did something quite extraordinary with the original iPhone that it launched in June 2007: It broke carriers' control over mobile operating system updates. Rather than there being multiple mobile OS versions, further fragmented by carrier distribution, Apple controls and distributes the updates."
Apple is on target to surpass WinMo… it has no chance going forth.
Umm, Ham — may I call you Ham? — I'm definitely sold on the iPhone koolaid, but in the interest of accuracy and fair play, per Apple's own quarterly reports last month, to date, they have sold just 17 million iphones as of 29 January 2009. And while most analysts agree they will further sell another 40-50 million iPhones in calendar 2009, it is doubtful that in under a month they have already sold the additional 23 million required to have overtaken lifetime sales of MS WinMobile.
Still, the point is well taken that in just under two years, Apple has sold nearly 40% of what has taken MS more than a decade — moreover, that MS has repeatedly missed its own sales estimates (let alone targets) for WM, and doesn't stand a chance of equalling iPhone sales for at least this year, thus giving Apple an almost guarantee of outselling WM's lifetime sales by sometime in 2010. This, of course, assumes the global economic meltdown does not continue to abate sales overall; that the trend of people replacing old cellphones with smart phones continues, etc.
Personally, I can't imagine that MS is really profitable with WinMobile, and, were it not MS, I would have expected t to fold by now. But their massive cash cow from Windows (for PC) and Office products allows them to stay in what Apple would see (relatively) as only a hobby market. Pride alone will keep Ballmer in this game; he has badmouthed Apple an iPhone too much and too often to concede any victory this early.
And competition is good for everyone, so, God Bless MS for trying to stay in a game where they are so hopelessly behind, in both sales and technological evolution. WiMob 6.5 is laughable, considering it is yet to be due, and Apple will likely have released a third generation OS and iPhone before 6.5 even ships.
The real star to watch is the return of Palm. WebOS looks EXTREMELY cool, and looks to have several advantages over iPhone — though iPhone arguably has several more in return. Apple will be hard-pressed not to steal/copy/leverage some examples Palm has laid forth, just as Palm has clearly taken from Apple's lead. I just hate that the inevitable course is that the two will both wind up in court trying to defend against the other, burning up company profits and reducing shareholder value and potential R&D monies.
Cheers
Rico
WinMo is not that profitable for MS…..
Microsoft makes about $8.00 per WinMo device. Microsoft would have to sell 300 Million licenses for WinMo to equal the revenue of 6.9 Million iPhones. Even when you consider net profit. Apple is reported to make about $250 – $300 per phone sold once you count carrier subsidies.
Even on the lowend. Microsoft would have to sell 40 licenses just to equal the profit of one iPhone.-
You guys are pretty deluded.
Apple to sell 50 million iPhones this year? So this quarter they will sell 10 million? More than double what they managed over the holiday season last year?
I guess you did not get the memo where Windows Mobile outsold the iphone in Q4 2008. Probably not.
And btw, is RIM also shutting down, because at 50 million sales thats just about the same as RIM sold over about the same period.
BTW – cut and paste. haha

Premenstrual syndrome
Treatment
PMS symptoms are transient. Because they disappear at the start of the menstrual flow, use of medication for treating mild cases may not be required.
Women who suffer regularly from PMS should watch their diet and make lifestyle adjustments during the days just before their period.
The three main rules to follow during the premenstrual period are:
1.
Eat a healthy diet
. Cut down on salt, sugar and caffeine. Eat smaller meals but more often, including more carbohydrates, fiber, fruit and vegetables with meals.
2.
Get physically active
. Even a half hour's walk can make a difference.
3.
Reduce stress
.
To relieve pain from PMS (headache, backache, etc.) pain relievers containing
acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin
, are helpful. In more severe cases, the physician can prescribe specific medications to treat individual symptoms. For example,
diuretics
are used to reduce fluid retention. In some cases
hormone therapy
is indicated.
Often,
vitamin supplements
(B and E) and
integrators
(calcium and magnesium) are useful. Calcium, in particular, relieves the feeling of fullness, mood changes and pain.
Antidepressants
may be required, but only in cases where emotional symptoms are especially intense. They should always be taken under a physician's guidance.

helped him learn the basic reading and elementary subjects.
Thanks to his love for reading and books, after self-teaching most of the subjects he later taught, Cordero opened a school for boys out of
his own home in 1810. He taught boys from free Blacks and poor families in San Germán, Puerto Rico. His sister Celestina followed suit and dedicated herself to teaching girls. Soon after they returned to San Juan and offered free education to poor children regardless of race and social status. In order to sustain himself financially, Cordero became a shoemaker and cigar maker. With his humble earnings he would also buy shoes and clothing to give to poorer folks in his community.
Of Cordero, it is said that after having been chosen by ”La Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País” to receive $100.00 pesos for his exemplary dedication to teaching the less fortunate, that he declined to take the money for himself. Instead, he gave half of the money to his neediest students and the rest to the beggars that had gathered outside his house upon hearing of the award. He would not accept the money on the grounds that teaching was his vocation.
It is for such act of human kindness and selflessness that we showcase Rafael Cordero during Black History month. An unconventional Afro-Latino who took action to improve the status quo rather than wait for change.

wrapping up the 30 day challenge the first of next week. Female, 35, 5,6" - Started challenge at 231 lbs, ideal weight for me is about 155 lbs (which I haven't been in 14 yrs). Having two kids and 13 yrs married to a wonderful chef has taken it's toll. We have indulged in MANY good (=bad) food and wines over the years.
So I started at 231 lbs and think next week I'll be about 215 lbs to round out the 30 days. I feel so much better. My Plantar fasciitis is still bothering me as well as heartburn but other than that all is good. I have not yet started working out daily as my knees and elbows have had issues brought on undoubtedly by my weight. So my thinking was lose as much as I could before I started exercising regularly. Also the weather lately has kept me from walking and enjoying the outdoors. I maintain a household and chase two special needs kids and 4 dogs around so I am not completely sedentary.
I am SO impatient! I feel better and i I feel like I should be skinny! My husband only had 20 lbs to lose and it seems he is almost there after 30 days. I have SOOOO much farther to go. I realize it took me 14 yrs to get to this bad place - its not going to come off overnight,..but I want it to darn it!
So I guess my question is - Should I start exercising more now? or do like the Atkins induction diet for awhile and lower my carbs even more for more weight loss to reduce the impact on my body and stress on my knees (any squat type exercises are very difficult). Or just Chill out and keep on eating healthy and the weight will come off as it should.
In the past on other SAD Diets 15 lbs in a month would have been great, but my mind set has totally changed now. I know this is how we will eat for the rest of our days. I want this flabby body gone for good ASAP.
First yes, congrats on the loss so far - 15 pounds is a big accomplishment!
We are in very similar situations!! I had been losing very slowly on primal/paleo (started at about 210) and meanwhile the weight is just falling off of my husband. I am a big believer in the fact that diet is way more important than exercise when it comes strictly to weight loss (read Gary Taubes if you haven't already - exercise may hamper your goals more than help at this point). For me personally, the scale did not start moving past snail speed until I cut the carbs drastically - pretty much Atkins induction-style. No fruit, 2-3 servings of green veggies daily, allowing some cheese (dairy doesn't seem to bother me), the rest is meat, eggs, and fat. I'm seeing a big difference.
Granted, I have heard other women say they need more carbs in their diet to lose, but sadly I think I'm one of those that can look at a carb and gain 3 pounds. But the results are very motivating so I'm not having a hard time sticking with it.
So I guess my biggest piece of advice is, don't worry about the exercise so much right now, especially if you think it's taking on too much at once (for me, I have a hard time trying to accomplish so many goals - I'm better off really focusing on the diet at first and then adding in exercise later). And, maybe try a VLC approach for a week and see how you do. If you're like me, it may push you faster towards the results you're looking for.
Good luck!
Congratulations on your success. Be patient, you'll get where you want to go. Listen to your body and go at your own pace. It's not a race. Slow and steady is best in the long run.
Our stories are similar. In March, 2010, I began eating better with the Diet Solution plan, then discovered Paleo and have been about 90% perfect since June. I started at 312 and am now 244. I am 61. I did not start exercising until January, when I started doing 90 seconds of squats or 90 seconds of wall pushbacks before I ate, which is a Tim Ferriss trick to push your food into muscles instead of fat. My limiting factor was my left hip, which was quite painful at times. I also have a history of back problems, so I wanted to be very careful with any kind of strength-training exercises.
I recently purchased The Slowburn Fitness Revolution and have started doing the exercises. Using light weights, you do each exercise for 90 seconds in slow motion until you can not do any more. That engages all 3 types of muscle fibers and forces them to grow. 30 minutes, once every 5 days. I also leaned that this method is great for cardio and flexibility. After my first workout, I knew I had pushed my muscles as far as they could go, but I was not sore in the slightest. That's waht I was looking for - something super efficient, but safe. The book is concise and easy to understand and I highly recommend it. Here's an excerpt: Here's a link to Amazon:
I know where you're coming from. I started out at 15 lbs per month average, but then I slowed down a lot. The slow-down was frustrating because I thought the rate would be consistent. I foolishly started planning dates of milestone markers, like -50, -100, etc. It will be ESPECIALLY frustrating when you start to hit plateaus.
The moral of the story is, weight loss is a marathon and not a sprint.
I am 5'2" and started out at 247, 6 years later I finally hit my goal weight of 136.
Personally, I think taking it slow really helped with mentally adjusting to the new nutrition and exercise regimens. I lost the majority of the weight, almost 80lbs, the first two years. The third year, I thought I had it all figured out and I went up 20. When I finally hit my first goal weight of 150, my trainer had me learn to maintain that for a year. Then I finally got off the last 15 with Paleo eating.
Personally, I would tell you to start adding exercise into your day if you can. When I first started I could only do 10/15 minutes on the bike or elliptical. If you could start with just some body weight exercises (squats/lunges/planks/etc) for even just 10 minutes, 3 days a week, I think it would help mentally and build your strength.
Most of us don't get to be obese, or near obese, without some issues with food. I think taking it slowly and adjusting your mind along with your body is key to keeping the weight off for the rest of your life.
It's an awesome and rewarding journey! Enjoy it.
Wow! Congratulations on the weight loss. 15 lbs. is awesome! I don't really have much advice, I've just started this as well. I lost 10 lbs. in the first month, but only have another 20 to go. My husband only lost 8 lbs and he still has over a hundred to go. I know he doesn't want to start exercise just yet, and he's still having a hard time giving up the carbs (he loves his almond biscuits!). I think keeping up your motivation is key, so do what you feel is best for you and stay motivated.
My advice right now would be, it aint' broke so what could you fix? YOu are losing weight fast, but losing weight too fast is not healthy either. Paleo is about maintaining a healthy weight but it's also about health in general. You don't want to do damage to yourself in your big hurry to lose weight. Find some patience! Believe me, I know the feeling about wanting to lose quickly, but long term, in order to truly succeed, you have to be concerned just as much about health as about vanity.
As for exercise, I would suggest you ease slowly into a low impact exercise routine. Swimming and/or water exercises are a great way to do that as the water supports your body but at the same time, provides gentle resistance to each movement.
Also got to fitday.com and make sure you are getting decent levels of all useful vitamins and minerals. I don't necesarily believe blindly in all the RDAs, but some of those nutrients truly are important. Since paleo is not a set diet but instead allows you to choose out of a variety of things to eat, it still is possible to end up picking a list of foods that may lack in a few important nutrients. And some nutrients that are important for joints, like magnesium, are not plentiful is many foods. People are tempted to assume many health problems are the result of age and ordinary wear and tear, but many health conscious eaters have been surprised to find that at least some of these problems suddenly go away once a more healthful and balanced diet is achieved.
You might want to check out this Gary Taubes article from New York Magazine titled, "The Scientist and the Stairmaster: Why Most of Us Believe Exercise Makes Us Thinner - And Why We're Wrong."
Taubes' basic argument is that exercise - especially so-called "cardio" - burns calories, but increases our appetite, causing us to eat as much or more than we burned off. I know that's been my experience.
I recently listened to a Podcast with Taubes, and the interviewer asked whether he thinks resistance training works better. Taubes thinks it could, not due to calories it might burn. Rather, Taubes thinks it might switch the way the body partitions energy into fat or protein (muscle). He said the body might start to think, "every few days we expend energy [lifting weights], so I'm going to put more of this energy into muscle." (My paraphrase). Resistance training has always helped me take weight off.
A lot of overweight people have aches and pains and it's common for these problems to be blamed on the obesity, the extra weight supposedly putting stress on the joints and the feet and what-not. But your weight of just over 200 pounds would be normal for a 6 ft tall guy, and he wouldn't have the aches and pains. Why? Because his body's adapted to the weight. Well, yours adapted to your weight also, unless you gained 100 pounds overnight.
I'm more inclined to blame systemic inflammation for your pain, assuming you did not have that fast of a weight gain. I say this from my own experience, because I have found that simple dietary changes make a world of difference between whether my joints and feet hurt and whether they don't. Lots of carbs and veggie oils = pain, cutting them back significantly = much less pain or none at all.
I know you have done a Paleo 30-day challenge and while you don't give specifics on what your diet is like now, from what I'm reading of what these challenges usually involve, I'll assume you still have some foods in your diet that it's possible to overdo. For instance, how's your intake of nuts and starchy tubers? Anything that's keeping your insulin elevated is going to contribute to inflammation, plus those nuts are heavy on the O-6s.
If you're following a strain of Paleo that's more Cordain-ish and cuts out the saturated fats, that could be part of the problem too.
If it's inflammation and you hit on something in your diet that's causing it, look for your pain symptoms to improve even before your weight loss accelerates, but I suspect that's going to happen as well, if insulin is the problem. It's not fast weight loss that's a problem per se so much as it's losing lean tissue instead of fat reserves.
You could also try testing for autoimmune disorders if that tendency runs in your family. Women who've borne children are more likely to suffer from them. But the tests don't always tell you everything. Still, it's something to consider depending on what else is going on in your life. And FWIW, diet can affect how bad the symptoms get even if you do have lupus or similar.
pleased to report at the 6 month mark (yesterday) I am 50 lbs gone and still losing. Haven't really worked out much, just have been naturally moving more. and have chilled out on fretting about weight and details,..tho I do weigh myself daily. Still have heartburn issues and occasional dizzy spells (mostly when working outside it seems) - but great other than that.
Hubby has lost 35 lbs and looks absolutely awesome!
Mine still seems to be coming off at good pace and I am 1 lb away from being in the 170's again -woooooohoooo! was 168 when I got married 13 yrs ago and that is next mini goal :-)
Thanks so much for all the kind words and understanding!
can't wait til the weather warms so I can start walking the dogs again!
I feel so superior when I walk through the grocery store like I "get it" on a whole new level and feel sorry for people as I walk past their heaping shopping carts laden with terrible stuff.
My next HUGE challenge is to convert the kids. We wanted to start ourselves and make sure we were motivated to make this a permanent life choice and set a good example for the kids. My son is autistic. We tried a GF/CF diet with him when he was 2 yrs old to see if it made a difference in his bad bowel issues. It didnt,..but I so wish we would have started paleo back then,....now they are older with a lot more fight in them lol It will be a battle at first.
thanks again!

PALESTINE —
Making special memories during the holidays can last a lifetime.
One of East Texas’ very few Christmas tree farms — MR and MS Trees in Tucker — offers memory-making opportunities as families can take a hayride around the tree farm to find the perfect tree to cut down and take home, enjoy the country-like atmosphere while roasting marshmallows, visit the gift shop or enjoy sitting in an Indian teepee.
Officially opening for the holiday season today, MR and MS Trees is open from 9 a.m. to dark Wednesdays through Saturday and 1 p.m. to dark on Sundays. Santa Claus will be at the tree farm for pictures and visits with the children on opening day today (this Friday only) and on all Saturdays and Sundays. The tree farm is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays for school tours.
“It’s a great way to make memories and something the whole family can enjoy — taking a ride on the hay wagon, walking around to find the right tree and cutting it down — instead of picking it from a tree lot,” said MR and MS Trees co-owner Michaelene Sparks, who owns the tree farm with her husband, Rick. “We usually have a fire going in the fire pit or in the teepee, if you want to roast marshmallows.
“They can visit with Santa first, have some hot chocolate, wassail or popcorn or get on the hay wagon to go to the field and choose their tree.”
Currently, families can choose their Christmas tree from about 2,000 Virginia Pines in the field. The tree farm also has about 75 pre-cut Frazier firs from North Carolina available. Prices start at $6 a foot for Virginia Pines and $8 a foot for the Frazier firs.
“We have a couple of families that meet here on the day after Thanksgiving and spend the day at the farm and then go their separate ways,” Sparks said. “One family comes from Galveston, the other from Athens and another from Dallas. They’ve been coming for years now.
“We also have a lot of people from around the Palestine area as well as far away as Dallas who ride the Polar Express™ at the Texas State Railroad one day, then come to the farm the next day.”
Uniquely, the tree farm also sells homemade wreaths and swags, as well as a variety of gift items in the gift shop.
“We sell fried Indian bread, ornaments, gift baskets, wassail, iron work, crosses, stocking stands and all kinds of goodies,” Sparks said. “I make my own fresh greenery for the homemade wreaths.”
Santa Claus also has a permanent mailbox at the farm for all the kids to drop off wish lists and letters for the times he is not able to be present. A play area also is available for children.
MR and MS Trees has supplied Christmas trees for several known places over the years. One year, the farm donated the tree for the State Capitol and has also given every soldier family serving a tree.
Locally, the tree farm offered non-profit organizations participating in the Dogwood Garden Club’s Festival of Trees event a free tree.
So far, the tree farm has eight different school groups booked for tours this season with room for more.
“We let them spend a little time in the teepee. They roast marshmallows, then ride the wagon where we explain how we plant the trees, trim them and how long it takes to grow them,” Sparks said. “Then they have lunch or play on the playground — whatever they like to do.”
The tree farm is handicap accessible and Wifi is available.
“We’ve been in business for over 10 years,” Sparks said.
MR and MS Trees is located at 342 ACR 2908 in Tucker, 12 miles from Palestine. From Palestine going down U.S. 79 South, take FM 645 in Tucker at the blinking yellow light just past Walmart Warehouse. Go 2.2 miles, take CR 2907, which will be the second road on left after turning off of U.S. 79. Drive to the end of the road until you see the store and sign on the right.
“Don’t use Google to find the farm — it may send you the wrong direction — make sure you are going toward Tucker,” Sparks warned.
For more information, call MR and MS Trees at 903-538-0160 or online at

Tuesday night, weary from a long day of teaching, I trudged into my bedroom, looking forward to nothing more than changing into my pajamas and curling up with a good book and a glass of wine. Instead, I found a strange man in my bed.
I threw back the covers to get a better look.
Yep, you guessed it. Meet Mr. Mandolin Man!
Like most of my previous boyfriends, he is beginning to show his age. He is one string short of a set and has a screw loose here and there. But I will do what I can to help him be the best he can be.
I adore him already. Thanks to my sons, Casey and Nathan, for bringing him into my life!

LOL! Too funny, Pam!
Thanks, Deb! (taking a bow) :-)
That is so cool! As I always say, damnit, we need another expensive, time-consuming hobby to fall in love with! Enjoy!
The perfect love story!
Hey, you needed a hobby to occupy your time, something to master so you don't get bored with all the spare minutes you have. LOL
Ah, Pam, you had me going there for a few minutes. LOL He's a cutie!!! and thank goodness, he doesn't eat much or leave wet towels on the bathroom floor. (grin)
Julee, I am a sucker when it comes to musical instruments in general. But learning to play the mandolin is on my bucket list. I think it's cool that my kids are supporting me in this. They get little enough time with me as it is! With my background, I usually pick things up pretty quickly. I am going to have my first lesson with Nathan's guitar teacher tonight. Wish me luck!
You are right on all counts, Carol! LOL!
You are right, Sandy; he is the perfect boyfriend. Glad I was able to make you smile!
So cute.
Marilyn
At least he can seranade you...with your help of course, you'll make beautiful music together. I hope you have a long, loving relationship. BTW: What's his name?
Sia
@Marilyn - Thank you! :-)
@Sia - That's a good question. Let me get back to you!
I love your boys. What great men/boyfriends/husbands they will be.
He's cute and looks very supportive. I'm glad you two are happy! - Lindy
I think this Mr. Right is definitely Mr. Wrong.:)
Aw, thanks, Denise. They sure are creative; I never know what they'll come up with next!
Thanks, Lindy. I'll have to introduce you the next time you come to my house! Just don't try to steal him away from me! ;-)
Anonymous, I think you're just jealous...
LOVE IT!!! Your kids are awesome.
You had me, too. Of course, I was on a business trip with no way to see what the heck you meant... But it was a nice surprise to pop over here and read about your new love.
Tami
LOL! Loved the post, Pam! :)
That is so funny!! Love Mandolin Man!!
:-)
Thanks Tami, Lisa and Christine. I had a lot of fun sharing my romantic tale! :-)
I hope you come to know him well.
Hi Pam, I have the same mandolin as you. I'm trying to lean more about it but mine is missing the manufacturer's label inside the body, behind the top f-hole. I'd appreciate to find out what yours says.
Ty, we have Oscar Schmidt model OM-10's. That sticker also contains a serial number. Thank you for stopping by my blog!

Albertina and Walter Sisulu of the African National Congress of South Africa. Albertina, the former leader of the ANC Women's League and member of parliament, joined the ancestors on June 2, 2011., a photo by Pan-African News Wire File Photos on Flickr.
Tribute to Albertina Sisulu
Ginny Stein reported this story on Sunday, June 5, 2011 08:24:00
ELIZABETH JACKSON: Tributes have been flowing in for anti-apartheid activist Albertina Sisulu who died at her Johannesburg home.
Sisulu and her late husband were key figures in the struggle against white minority rule in South Africa.
Our Africa correspondent Ginny Stein reports.
GINNY STEIN: Albertina Sisulu was one of the leading lights of the anti-apartheid movement. Her death at her home in a suburb in which once only white people were allowed to live, was sudden.
One of her sons, Mlungisi says Mama Sisulu, as she was affectionately known by all who knew her, was with two of her grandchildren watching the news on television, when she died.
MLUNGISI SISULU: We, it was really sudden. Because she was in good health, she was actually, it was only this afternoon, and at 92, she was fairly healthy. That's how it has happened, she has passed on.
GINNY STEIN: Albertina Sisulu's first career was as a nurse, a profession which helped support her family during the more than 25 years her husband Walter was jailed alongside Nelson Mandela.
While not from a political background, she quickly established herself as an anti-apartheid activist. In 1956, she was among those who led a march of more than 20,000 women protesting against carrying passbooks which prohibited people of different races moving between areas.
She was the first woman to be held under the regime's 90-day detention order.
The ANC's Valli Moosa.
VALLI MOOSA: She was also - many people have not realised that she was at the time the only woman that led a truly national movement. She was not just leader of the woman's league or the woman's federation, but she presided over the united democratic front and the mass democratic movement which was truly a national movement.
And she did this, I must say, with the gentleness of the nurse that she was. At the time when she became president, she still worked as a nurse in Soweto. But with the firmness and discipline that leadership in those difficult conditions needed and she commanded tremendous respect.
GINNY STEIN: In the 1980s Mrs Sisulu became an envoy for the ANC, visiting leaders overseas to draw attention to the anti-apartheid struggle.
In 1983, she led a delegation of activists, which included Azhar Cachalia, to the United States to meet US president George Bush.
Today, Mr Cachalia was amongst those paying his respects to a woman who he says played a crucial role in South Africa's development as a democratic nation.
AZHAR CACHALIA: She played the role of a unifying person in the 1980s and she was during that period without her husband, many of the members of her family were outside of the country, with one or two exceptions. And so she was wonderfully inspiring and in a sense was not only a leader but somebody you could get counsel from.
GINNY STEIN: You knew her personally, what did she mean to you?
AZHAR CACHALIA: Well you know, she was simultaneously a leader and kind of mother figure. She's a gentle person, you know, in fact, I never remembered her losing her temper. She had much reason to.
GINNY STEIN: In 1984, Albertina Sisulu took her seat in South Africa's first democratically elected parliament.
She was last seen in public in May when she cast her vote in local municipal elections.
Two of her children have followed their parents into politics. Her daughter Lindiwe is defence minister, her son, Max is speaker of the parliament.
A state funeral is expected to be held.

: New president ‘to decriminalise homosexuality’
by Stephen Gray for PinkNews.co.uk
18 May 2012, 4:06pm last month after president Bingu wa Mutharika died of a heart attack.
He had pardoned two men sentenced to Mutharika pardoned two citizens on “humanitarian grounds only” after they were charged on homosexuality offences.
Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga had attempted a marriage ceremony, with confusion over whether the latter identified as a trans woman in some reports.
Pardoning the couple from charges of gross indecency and unnatural acts, Mr Mutharika had said: “These boys committed a crime against our culture, our religion and our laws.
“However, as the head of state I hereby pardon them and therefore ask for their immediate release with no conditions.”.”
1 comment:
I can't beleave this is her first international engagement. The president of Malawi should really reconsider her decision on gay marriage. The west has forced poor nations into accepting their way of life forgetting that we know poligamy is already outlawed in the US. Why wouldn't UK, Germany, France and the mighty US sample poligamy before we Africans sample their gayism.

Debby in Commonwealth Land this October painted quite a pretty picture, claim onlookers. Thank you paparazzi, I appreciate it. Now that I am back at my cubicle in MKCL, having driven through some completely un-Delhi Pune lanes, all I can do is rewind and play. Here are Durga Puja highlights, freshly baked from reflections, in order of arbitrary preference:
1. Couture Culture: There’s nothing like going back to your wardrobe and finding it revamped. Ah you envious souls, that’s exactly what happened to me! There were blues and there were reds and rosy pinks and jade greens… if there is bliss it is this.
2. My Ground Floor Friend: We have a new friend – our tenant: mother of two, animated, enthusiastic little lady… oodles of fun! Though this was the first time I was meeting her, I felt as if have known her for years. She is a Godsend considering Mom has terrible mood swings with Dad and me both staying away.
3. Camera Camaraderie: Blame it on my days in Pune, but a camera and I together can be quite a menace. It’s great fun capturing every little moment in print, especially when you know it will become a memory in the very next. I got photos of every pandal we went to, of Ma cooking me parathas, of my cats cozily asleep, of my Dad in his stylish avatars, the works. I now have a fine flipbook to show to my great grandchildren. “Oh yes sweetheart, your pardadi was always a sweet creature!”
4. Sur Gunje Taal Baaje: That’s what they call our D-Block Puja Samity’s karaoke competition. Apart from rousing from sleep several delightful Bangla songs from my childhood and tapping my feet to some melodious voices, it also served immense comic relief. Not everyone is born with music in his vocal chords. Mr. Green Kurta vowed to prove otherwise. My apologies for being so smug but Mr. Green Kurta and his Atif renditions were barely pushing the limits of Giggle Control, when he arrived with an oh-so-soulful ‘Maula Mere le le meri jaan...’. His scale went left and the orchestra went right even as he sat down on his knees to counter the turbulence. I giggled and giggled some more before I found the phone a good excuse to escape out.
5. Kala Khatta: Flashback…Cut to School…Debby looks with puppy eyes at Aanchal Jain who indifferently devours one ice lolly after another, the Cola taking the highest priority. The steaming hot 2′oclock Delhi summer sun blazes mercilessly on. Mom didn’t give me pocket-money back then and I never asked for any. The only time I wished I had a few bucks on me was when I stood waiting for our drop home bus – my throat parched and my water bottle empty. Needless to say, I have several reasons for relishing a kala khatta whenever I get the chance.
6. Kitty Bonanza: Family planning measures aren’t that far-reaching after all or maybe our house cats are just too fond of kids. Every time I go home there are new kittens to fondle, this time being no exception. There was a white one – too impish for his own good and a brown one – quiet and mature. Few things compare to sitting out on the terrace with a couple of cuddly cats to hug.
7. Saddi Delhi and Dilliwale: I know, I know. The way I go on about Delhi makes it seem like the most charming little town where horses nuzzle your hands for sugar and children walk to school amidst sheep grazing in Swiss like Alps. The press seems to be in compliance lately – Delhi is fast becoming a world-class city and my most cherished little nooks and crannies just got more delightful. An hour-long drive around my hometown recharges my batteries enough to face at least week-long drudgery. (And no God, this isn’t by any means a challenge… you know how my feeble little soul craves peace) to say nothing of the people who make Delhi what it means to me. Though I say it myself, I am among the luckiest people alive to have a family whose world begins and ends with me.
Cut to Present… So as I was saying, I am back after my week-long vacation. I won’t say I am rested as Durga Puja for a Bengali is more crazily strenuous than an ordinary day at work. But yes, I have November to look forward to – which promises Diwali and my Birthday (yippee!) among other events.
So give me a bit to get Pune-cized again. Until then.
@Sanjay:
you lucky soul… you keep visiting so often.
Indeed ya…there’s sumthing exceptionally special about the place you’ve spent your childhood in.
I feel like I vistited delhi during the month of October

2012-13 Threads Basketball Century Greats: The Panini America Insert Set Inspection
During the last five days, we’ve attempted to prepare you for the upcoming release of 2012-13 Threads Basketball by providing glimpses into many of the product’s most-colorful, modern-era insert sets, including Inside Presence, Talented Twosomes and High Flyers. Today, we depart from that pattern to showcase the history-soaked Century Greats insert.
This 25-card tribute to the NBA’s greatest all-time performers features a superbly simple design — incorporating a whitish hardcourt backdrop that allows the larger-then-life legends featured to pop off the card.
As its name suggests, Century Greats brings together basketball’s best and most-collected icons from the last 100 years, including the likes of Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen and more.
You can admire the entire 25-card set in the gallery below. Enjoy, and stay tuned to The Knight’s Lance for additional previews of 2012-13 Threads Basketball in advance of its October 24 release date.
Really like these…they would look even sweeter with a swatch of jersey behind the player like silhouettes in Crown Royale..maybe even signed.
Once again, I am very impressed with the background of the card. Someone sure has great visual ideas for the layout behind the card recently. Makes it seem like the layout of the card is more than an afterthought to the picture. I guess that’s the photo nerd in me speaking!
Love the mid-80s Dr J. He was one of my favorites growing up. Back then (early 80s) the 76ers had a “team hypnotist” who was a science teacher at my middle school. Every marking period, he gave a pair of courtside seats to the kid in his class who had the highest average. I never had him as a teacher, but it was sure cool. Can’t picture something like that happening today.
Thanks for the gallery previews!!!
This looks very promising. Would love yo collect this!
This looks great. Its surely a century greats. Hopefully panini gets mj. Anyway would still love to have this awesome looking inserts. Thanks tracy !
THIS IS AMAZING!!!! WHEN DO THESE COME OUT!!??!! WOW!! REALLY LOOKING FROWARD TO THIS!!!
2012-13 Threads releases Oct. 24.
Actually looking forward to this subset. I wish you did a SP of on card autographs for this set.
Yet another insert set from Threads that I like looking at. So glad that I have a case of Threads on the way, every insert set so far is on my want list, let alone the rookie autos, ooh lala. Well done Panini. Only negative is that I cant wait any longer.
Makes me sad. Products continue to decline. Where are the cards for active players? Bring back a Topps Total type product.
Out of topic… When will the draw for theXRCs for the 2011 rookie held?
October 29.
Tracy, any chance for some previews on the actual cards that will be shipped after the draw has taken place?
Also do you have some more info on how this draft is actually gonna work?
Thanks!
Daniel
Hey, Daniel. As soon as I get some sneak peeks on those cards, I’ll show them off here. Also, as for how the live checklist draft will work, it will be be done live via our blog, Twitter and Facebook pages and also will be recorded and posted on YouTube. If our internal firewall cooperates, it also will be live on BlogTV (fingers crossed).
I hope these inserts have an auto version of this as well! That would be sweet!

MONTREAL (AP) -After following in Tony Esposito's footsteps in Chicago, Ed Belfour was happy to catch up with the legendary goalie in Montreal.
Belfour made 29 saves for his first shutout in nearly three years and Jay Bouwmeester scored late in the second period to lift the Florida Panthers to a 1-0 win over the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday night.
The 41-year-old goalie's 76th career shutout drew him even for eighth on the NHL career list with Esposito, who had two shutouts with Montreal at the outset of his career before going forging a Hall of Fame career with the Chicago Blackhawks.
"It's definitely an honor to be tied with Tony, one of my heroes," said Belfour, who began his career with Chicago in 1988, four years after Esposito retired.
Belfour made a sprawling pad save on Steve Begin midway through the third and survived a late flurry to earn his first shutout in 37 games with Florida this season. It was his first blanking since April 3, 2004, at Ottawa with Toronto - a span of 86 games.
"This guy's unbelievable as far as taking care of his body, as far as stretching and understanding his body and knowing what he has to do," Panthers coach Jacques Martin said. "It's nice to see him get some results."
Bouwmeester scored his ninth goal 16:16 into the second for the Panthers, who won for the third time in four games against Montreal this season.
Cristobal Huet stopped 24 shots for the Canadiens, who lost their fourth in a row. Montreal is 8-15-1 since its season-high, five-game winning streak from Dec. 12-21.
"It's like walking in quicksand. You take one step forward and three steps back," Canadiens coach Guy Carbonneau said. "You have to work twice as hard to get somewhere. It seems like that's what we're doing right now."
Kamil Kreps had a goal disallowed midway through the third for Florida. Referee Kerry Fraser immediately waved off what would have been Kreps' first NHL goal, ruling that Juraj Kolnik interfered with Huet.
Montreal defenseman Sheldon Souray hit the left post during a long two-man advantage for the Canadiens, which was cut short by 20 seconds when captain Saku Koivu was sent off for tripping.
Bouwmeester's goal was the first scored in two games between the teams in Montreal this season, ending a scoreless streak that lasted 101 minutes, 16 seconds. Huet and Florida's Alex Auld both got credit for shutouts in Montreal's 1-0 shootout win on Nov. 28.
"Somehow we play pretty good defense against this team," Panthers captain Olli Jokinen said. "Both goalies played well. The first two periods we probably had better chances than they did and we managed to score that one goal. The third period, they got some chances and we took some penalties but Eddie was outstanding."
Alex Kovalev didn't dress for the Canadiens because of an upper body injury. The Russian right wing was benched for most of the third period in Saturday's 5-3 loss to Ottawa.
The Panthers had a 12-5 shots advantage in the first and finally broke through on Huet late in the second.
Bouwmeester jumped on a lose puck in front of the crease and flipped it over the Canadiens goalie, who was sprawled along the ice.
Montreal had a magnificent opportunity to draw even when Stephen Weiss was given a delay of game penalty for flipping the puck over the glass at 14:12. Alexei Semenov had gone off for hooking six seconds earlier.
Souray, Montreal's leading scorer, had the best chance for a goal on the ensuing 5-on-3 power play but his point shot struck the left post.
Notes: Kreps has one assist in nine games this season. ... Canadiens D Craig Rivet missed his third straight game. He is recovering from pneumonia and is expected to also sit out on Wednesday in New Jersey.

The iconic Golden Gate Bridge turns 75 years old tomorrow (opened May 27, 1937) and continues to inspire locals and tourists alike. With its distinct “international orange” color and twin towers, it’s one of the most photographed subjects in the world, and almost certainly the most photographed bridge. Undoubtedly part of the allure lies in it’s striking setting between the skyline of downtown San Francisco and the rugged promontories of the Marin headlands. The Golden Gate is synonymous with San Francisco and the Bay Area and a testament to the amazing beauty of this region. Here are a few of my contributions to the the millions of photos and other artistic renditions of this “wonder of the world”!

Hello Papercrafter’s Corner Friends! It’s almost Springtime and you know what that means, right?
✿ It’s time for growth and renewal✿
That has been especially true here at PaperCrafter’s Corner. We’ve been quietly focusing on new beginnings behind the scenes!
Big Changes at PCC
Friend, you and the rest of the PaperCrafter’s Corner papercrafting community have been a huge part of my life for the past 3 1/2 years. Can you believe I started PaperCrafter’s Corner in June 2009?
Wow. Since then, the ups, downs, changes, expansions and learning experiences have been life changing.
THANK YOU for being part of me & my life. Thank you for helping me create such a dynamic, positive and important resource for papercrafters!
And now?
It’s time for a new “head PCC cheerleader” to take over! It’s time for a new leader to bring her energy, excitement, scrapbook industry experience & business savvy to PaperCrafter’s Corner.
Introducing Stephanie!
Stephanie Hackney, an industry columnist and passionate paper crafter, is taking over PaperCrafter’s Corner! Stephanie and I have known each other both professionally and personally for several years and I feel very comfortable handing over the care and feeding of my ‘baby” to her as I move on to a new life chapter.
She has tons of ideas to enhance the site for you and to provide you with more of the papercrafting information, inspiration and entertainment you love. In fact, if you’ve been reading our Facebook posts and checking out our pins over the last couple weeks, you’ve seen her in action already.
Stephanie is super excited to get to know all of you and to bring even more cool stuff to the PaperCrafter’s Corner community.
Stephanie’s Thoughts
“Since the very beginning, I have admired Susan’s dedication to building such a valuable resource for papercrafters. It has been so fun to see her take her idea and bring it to life! She has worked tirelessly to ensure that visitors to the PaperCrafter’s Corner site (and associated social media pages) were always presented with valuable content, a positive experience, and a reason to return again and again. I know she has informed and entertained me, a passionate papercrafting addict and long-time industry participant.
I intend to expand the PaperCrafter’s Corner offering by making necessary behind-the-scenes changes and enhancements (check the faster load speed on our site pages!) and adding both new functionality and new information based largely on what the PaperCrafter’s Corner community tells me it wants (yes, this is YOUR chance to make your voice heard – let me know what YOU want to find at PCC!). For you, our paper crafters extraordinaire, there will be more information, more entertainment, more inspiration and, hopefully, even more fun than what you’ve already experienced as a PaperCrafter’s Corner supporter! It is my goal to build on what Susan started and make the PaperCrafters’ Corner offering even better!”
As you can imagine, handing over something I’ve poured my heart and soul into was no easy decision. But it was time. And, I do believe PaperCrafter’s Corner is in good hands! I look forward to seeing PCC grow and prosper further. I can’t wait to see where Stephanie takes you!
So, what will I be doing now?
I have taken on a wonderful new challenge as the Director of Marketing for OfficeZilla.com, an office supplies etailer with great prices & a fun, quirky attitude! Yes, all of the things I learned over the years from running PaperCrafter’s Corner are proving invaluable in my new career at OfficeZilla. For example, just part of my new duties include managing the wacky OfficeZilla blog, the OZ facebook page, and orchestrating promotions with industry product companies. I’d say PCC equipped me pretty well for this and more, wouldn’t you? Just wait till I try to get my new co-workers to pose for pix so I can scrapbook about my career change! LOL
Thank you!
Thank you again for everything you guys have done for me. It has been an amazing experience. This industry has provided so much joy for me and for so many others and it’s all because of the amazing people involved in it, people like you.
I know you will support Stephanie and PaperCrafter’s Corner going forward! She’s shared a few of her plans with me and I think you guys are gonna be thrilled!
Be sure to stay tuned to see the great things she has up her sleeve…
If you haven’t already, be sure to subscribe to the PaperCrafter’s Corner blog updates here, like PCC on Facebook, follow the PCC Pinterest boards, and engage with PCC on Twitter. (Steph is much more active on Twitter than I am, so PCC Twitter peeps stay tuned!)

When I was asked by Trini of NOZZA Studio if I wanted to be a part of The Wedding Clique, I was thrilled. TWC is Your One-stop Everything Wedding Shop that offers wedding planning resources.
One of the unique concepts TWC has is to shoot video footage in a section title Clique TV where tips and ideas are shared for questions couples have about their upcoming event. With that we decided to do video introductions of the members of TWC. Check out my video under my About section!
The Wedding Clique {Clique TV} – Paper Cut Industries
The group consists of several top wedding professionals almost exclusively in Long Beach, California.
The group includes Trini of NOZZA Studio, an event planning studio in downtown Long Beach. Trini is a fantastic planner that I have had the pleasure to work with on several projects. She is actually the only retailer who currently carries Paper Cut Industries wedding collection.
Another amazing talent in the group is Henry of Henry Chen Photography. He has such a great eye for capturing each special moment of any event.
Leading the florals for the group is the ever friendly Deanne of BELLA FiORE. She provides floral arrangements for weddings and large events that are “funky, fresh and fabulous”. How fantastic is that!?
Another fantastic stationery designer in the group is the insanely sweet Gamie of Peach Mailbox. She has created one of the most innovative greeting cards available today. Scented cupcake, hand-stitched cards. Words cannot do her work justice. You must check out her cards which are available at several retailers including at NOZZA’s studio.

From Paragon Wiki
- What’s the deal with Malaise?
-.
- How does the Fortunata Mind Link work, from a story perspective? Can they use it to telephatically communicate with each other?
- Fortunata’s have a wide range of psychic abilities but they tend to be most powerful in the area of precognition. Their Mind Link is more like a psychic slide show than true telepathy, flashing future images into another mind.
- In Arachnos, do the Arbiters (as a position) pre-date Recluse's rise to power? If so, do they consider themselves truly answerable to him (as their duty is to serve Arachnos itself). I mean sure they do as matter of course, but if they felt he was a threat to Arachnos itself...
- Although the position of Arbiter existed before the current regime, the Arbiters were empowered by Lord Recluse to prevent the day to day disputes that are inevitable in an organization like Arachnos from becoming completely counterproductive. Lord Recluse and the Arbiters have a symbiotic relationship. They know that their untouchable status is in large part provided by the threat of Lord Recluse. On the other hand, the Arbiters strengthen Recluse’s position by mitigating internal threats. No one in Arachnos would casually choose to oppose Lord Recluse, and indeed he has never given them reason, but if the Arbiters united against him it would certainly be a conflict that would shake the Rogue Isles to their foundation.
- How successful were the twenty-six* other Rikti invasion fleets compared to the Paragon City Fleet, and could you name a few locations the Rikti invaded besides Paragon City?
- The other Rikti invasion fleets were causing massive damage and loss of life before Dr. Science’s plan (and Omega Team’s sacrifice) caused a full scale retreat. The destruction of the U.N. buildings in New York and Geneva were only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the other fleets activities. Rome, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing, Moscow, Mumbai, Mexico City, Tokyo, Cairo and Sao Paulo were other Rikti targets.
- Do Rikti have "families" in the same sense that humans do?
- Although many Rikti customs are based on their human ancestry, few of them exactly mirror our own due to their radically different path. However the Rikti definitely have concepts of love, friendship, and family even if they aren’t exactly the same as ours.

Continuing with the Lolla / Chicago posts......welcome to Day 2.
Saturday was a great day for live music at the festival. Everyone from Maps & Atlases, Walk The Moon, Cee Lo, Beirut, Eminem as one of the headliners and then my two spotlight bands.....Ellie Goulding and Fitz and the Tantrums! You might remember Ellie from my spotlight on her -> here......the girl is amazing and puts on an energetic show. Fitz is a band I'd be surprised if you haven't been hearing them everywhere recently! They have really been taking off, and their fame is well deserved, their live shows are full of their signature soul/pop catchy tunes and are always worth seeing, so be sure to check their fall tour dates.
This outfit was the perfect combination of light, breezy and fun, plus it was easy to take it from day-to-night as we progressed out to the Fitz after party at Schuba's. And I'm really into this new 'sheer dress with the fitted mini underneath it' look......you might see a lot of it in future posts!

Ms BURKE (Chisholm—Deputy Speaker) (11:47): I rise today to speak about Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012. I do so with some excitement because some of the measures in this bill will go a long way to assisting with the introduction of the clean energy bills package—something quite welcomed in my seat.
While I do not dispute the member for Barker's desire to represent his electorate and to speak forcefully for it, I am sick and tired of my constituency—people who live in the suburbs—being held to ransom and being told that we can no longer spend money in the suburbs. I hate to point it out to everybody, but that is actually where most people live! If you look at proportion of spend, that is where it goes. I can attest that in my years in opposition—all nine of them—the Howard government put no money into my electorate beyond normal program funding. I did not get one spend beyond that—not once. Being in a marginal seat, I always found it quite interesting that they were not trying to attract some votes by funding something. I used to try to get them to fund something in my seat so that they could claim it and we could have it done. But in the nine years of the Howard government where I was in parliament not one additional spend was made—not one sports centre, not one additional road upgrade and no extra money into my hospitals, which are two of the largest in the country. Now, under a Labor government, we have seen spending based on requirements and not just on vote buying.
I also want to point out, in discussing these appropriation bills, the quite outrageous hypocrisy and inconsistency of the amendment moved by the member for Goldstein, Andrew Robb, of putting these expenditures on hold. This is at the same time, in the last couple of days of parliament, as we have had those opposite moaning that we have now finally passed the changes to the private health legislation to cap and means test the private health rebate. On the one hand, the opposition is telling us we cannot afford to spend money, but on the other hand they are trying to prevent the government of the day securing better outcomes in health by taking back a proportion of the money going towards private health funds. That money was in no way, shape or form assisting the health system of this country. I want to spend a bit of time on these inequities in the opposition's argument and some of the inconsistencies around the private health insurance rebate. A lot of people in my electorate take out private health insurance, and I commend them for that. I myself have private health insurance and understand how expensive it is. But putting a rebate into the private health system did nothing to repair the health system. Let us look at this: it was money going to an insurance scheme. It was not going to private hospitals; it was not going to patients; it was not going to doctors. It was going to private health funds, to insurance schemes.
I said at the time the bills were introduced into the House by the Howard government many moons ago that this was inequitable. It was bad policy. Ask any health economist, any health expert. It was bad and flawed policy because, over time, more and more revenue from the health budget was going to prop up private health funds, insurance schemes. Surely if the coalition had wanted more people to take up private health insurance they would have made their schemes better.
I am sure that all of you in this place have had to deal with family members and individuals going to hospital. In the last couple of years my family and I have had to deal with both the private and public systems on many occasions. Tragically, 12 months ago my father died. He spent an enormous amount of time in the public health system. We could not have asked for better care than the care he got. Given the procedure that he needed and the fact that he was then going to spend an awfully long time in ICU, he could only have got that care in the public system. He spent a lot longer in ICU than any of us would have desired and several months ago he unfortunately died. But it was not because of the health care he got in the public system. No private system could have provided that care.
A couple of months later my mother ended up in a private hospital, where she was told: 'We can't do that procedure. We're going to put you in an ambulance and send you to a public hospital and we're going to charge you $500 for the joy of being here for the last couple of hours while we assessed that we cannot look after you.' She got nothing back from her private health fund. The inequities in the system are about how the system works, not about throwing more money at it. We have never gone to the crux of it: actually repairing the system.
My son has had to undergo surgery on numerous occasions because he was born with fused fingers. This was a very odd thing, a very simple little thing, but I wanted my son to have fingers that he could eventually use. All of this surgery was performed by a private practitioner whom we chose but it was done within the public hospital system. Why? Because the surgeon wanted to perform the surgery at the Children's Hospital because that is where all the care and equipment are that were going to be needed if, touch wood, anything ever went wrong. It never did. But that is where the surgery happened. He could have had all that surgery in the public system and we could have chosen to go as public patients but we elected not to because we could afford not to. It would have been the same surgeon and the same team but we chose not to. We were asked on that day whether we wanted to go public or private. It is about the inequities in the system, not just throwing more money at it and propping it up.
Health is a big issue in my electorate. A great proportion of my constituents take out private health cover. A lot of my constituents work in the medical sector. I have in my electorate two of the largest hospitals in the country. Many people from outside the electorate come to these hospitals. Members opposite probably have constituents who have come to Box Hill Hospital and Monash Medical Centre. Monash Medical Centre is a very big hospital that also has a private hospital within it, so it has the two systems working together. I also have Epworth Eastern, a great private hospital that works really well in conjunction with the public hospital across the road. I have some smaller private hospitals that do great work. I have amazing medical researchers at both Monash Medical Centre and Monash University. Health is a big thing in my area. It would probably be the largest employer after Monash University. It is a big issue and it plays an important part. But it is about funding it appropriately. Where should we fund this? I say propping up an insurance system is not the right way to go. Carol Bennett, CEO of the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, wrote in an interesting opinion piece:
Contemporary health policy discussions are generally about vested economic interests competing within an antagonistic political system. While these ‘policy’ discussions impact directly on health consumers, they are rarely referenced to real health outcomes.
Real health is about how we look after ourselves, our family and friends, our workplaces, our communities and our environments. It is about regulation and safety (seat belts, random blood alcohol testing, OHS, etc.), access to quality food and water and hygienic sanitation, access to preventative health. It is about exercise, nutrition and well-being. It is about belonging. It is about us.
Discussions about our health care systems are usually about money and there is a compelling case for adopting this approach. Around 1 in 8 Australians are employed in the health sector, making it the largest employment sector in Australia—
On the record, I flag a vested interest because my husband, as many of you may know, works within the health sector as a MICA paramedic. He also lectures at Monash University within that sector and I know it quite well. My father-in-law is a physician. I know there are a lot of people who work in the healthcare sector; I am quite related to it. I will go on with the article:
It is also a sector that is growing at a much greater rate than most others—healthcare needs are expanding, as are community expectations from our ageing population to have access to the best possible care. Health is a remarkably resilient economic powerhouse in Australia and around the world.
Almost all health policy creates economic winners and losers among the existing players. If a particular drug becomes much cheaper to consumers by being listed on our subsidised Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the drug manufacturer makes more money through increased sales. A higher Medicare rebate for certain procedures allows doctors to charge more and increase their income.
Any Health Minister proposing cost saving changes to the health system is going to have to run a gauntlet of opposition from those who will lose money if the policy change is implemented.
The article goes on to cite the situation under the last parliament when the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, tried to reduce the Medicare rebate for cataract surgeries. The article further states:
Cataract surgery rebates is one example cited by Dr Tony Webber, the former head of the Medicare watchdog, the Professional Services Review, in the current edition of the Medical Journal of Australia. Dr Webber argues that billions of dollars of savings can be achieved if the government is prepared to take on vested interests across the health system. He is right.
... ... ...
Vested economic interests in health care systems will always oppose any change that potentially reduces their income. Oppositions will usually seek to gain political capital by joining any chorus of disenchantment. Unfortunately these two forces currently seem to be the major drivers of our health care system.
That is right. It is about the politics, not the health. What we need to get back to are good health outcomes. Let us actually talk about where money should be going: into good health outcomes. The majority of the consumer watchdogs have welcomed the changes to the private health rebate, and there are great needs within that. Many of the players within the sector have welcomed the change because it will put money back into the system, where it is needed, not propping up the rebate.
Back in February 2009, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association wrote:
The $3.5 billion private health insurance (PHI) rebate needs further scrutiny in the light of advice from the Federal Treasury that it does not deliver value for money, according to the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association (AHHA).
The AHHA is the peak national body representing public hospitals, area health services, community health centres and public aged care providers.
AHHA has previously called for the PHI rebate to be evaluated to assess whether or not it represents the best use of scarce health resources ...
Since the program was introduced by the Howard Government it has never been assessed against its objectives. This is despite the fact that many economists and other health experts have expressed serious concerns that it is an inefficient use of tax-payer funds.
That is who is paying for this: the taxpayers. I am not talking about winners and losers or rich and poor. I think that is a spurious argument. I do not think it is about people subsidising others; it is about the best use of the money. It is about assessing where the health dollar can go. Again from the AHHA, yesterday:
Means testing the rebate will result in a fairer use of public health funding and not impose any additional burden on public hospitals.
AHHA has done extensive modelling on the impact of the proposal and found that only 15% of the insured population or about 1.53 million people will be affected by the changes. For this small group - the wealthiest in the community - their rebate will fall by between 10% and 20%.
We know from past experience that price has relatively little effect on private insurance membership. For example, when the rebate was first introduced in 1999, membership grew by only 2% for every 10% reduction in price. The proposed reforms will simply reverse that for higher income people. At an average 14% increase in price, only 31,000 would now be expected to drop their private insurance. This estimation is almost identical to that reached independently by Treasury.
Only a small proportion of those who drop it will ever appear in a public hospital setting. So it is about where the best bang for your buck can be found within health. In the short time remaining I would also like to put on the record what benefits my electorate has received from the changes the government has introduced. We have actually seen some infrastructure spending within Chisholm. I have been delighted to go to all of my school openings for the BER and the National School Pride program. I am going to go along very soon to Box Hill High School, where they have had a community partnership working together, to open the SATERN science block, which is a federally funded initiative. I had the delight of going to Ashwood College in my electorate, which was promised money by the Baillieu government. Tragically, Ashwood College has now been hit twice by arsonists and it has not been repaired after either of those fires. Whilst the state member for Burwood went to the election promising that the high school would be rebuilt, nothing has happened. Those children are being educated in an environment that is just appalling. The previous state government had committed the funds to build an entire new school on the site. That has now been scrapped. No money has been given. The only new building that has been opened on the site of Ashwood College is a new science wing built under the BER funding arrangement. It is a testament to what you can do in those schools. It will lift that school and it will help the community greatly.
I have had the joy of going to all of my Catholic and private primary schools, who have welcomed, embraced and are incredibly grateful for this funding. It has allowed them to do things they would never have done. Particularly in the Catholic sector there is great appreciation for what has gone on and most of them say, 'We spent the money wisely. We don't know what all the fuss is about.' I have had money go to all of my state, private and independent schools. I have had money go into the two universities and the TAFE within my seat. This will help us into the future in this education space. I commend the bills to the chamber.

Senator BOYCE (Queensland) (11:07): After that contribution from Senator Sterle we cannot claim that the government is not singing from the same song sheet. They are singing the song of the politics of envy nonstop. That was perhaps one of the most malicious and revolting contributions I think I have heard in this chamber. In case Senator Sterle was not aware, most large businesses started out as small businesses. Let us look at the transport industry and Lindsay Fox's business and Sir Peter Abeles' business. They were people who started out and used their own intelligence and their own sheer hard physical labour to create something big and worthwhile and profitable. And guess what? They used those profits to pay wages and to build their companies—to invest in more products, more technology and more research. That is what small businesses do in this country, but they certainly will not be able to under this disgusting government.
I was rather hoping that after the fracas, the latest little effort of Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd, had settled down and we finally worked out who the Prime Minister was it would mean the government would get on with government. But it has not. The same song of mismanagement and envy just goes on and on. Today I have been reviewing the report done by the Senate Economics Committee on the minerals resource rent tax and two other reports that are going to come down today—one on the personally controlled e-health records and one on the MySuper legislation. With each of them, you do not have to read our dissenting reports to realise how poorly managed they are, what a mishmash there is with the lack of negotiation and 'Oops, we got that wrong; we'd better change that.' A litany of mistakes applies to every one of these reports. You can read the government report. The only thing that is missing at the end of every one of the government's reports—with this long litany of a lack of consultation, a lack of understanding, poor timing and poor leadership—is 'and so we need to fix it'. This government limps along trying to put bandaids on whenever they discover 'Oh goodness, we can't even try to pretend that we'll put that through!'
These bills relating to the minerals resource rent tax are a classic example of what this government do not know about business and will never know about business—and one hopes they will be out of government before they destroy any opportunities there are for business. Let us look, for example, at Senator Sterle's laughable comment that 'there aren't small miners'. Just because you have six zeros on the company balance sheet does not mean you are big; it means that you are in an industry that requires very deep and long-term investment to make a profit. And that is what the people in the mining industry in Australia have done over centuries. We are very lucky in Australia. This government is extraordinarily lucky that the mining industry and the profits from the mining industry are currently masking their extraordinary ineptitude. It beggars belief that this government cannot even recognise that what they are doing is destroying their own golden goose. The only thing that will keep them in government is good profits from the mining industry—because they are just useless at anything else.
Let us look, for example, at the profit mark of $75 million. I first made these comments in relation to the BAS. We have this wonderful view that, if someone makes a $1 billion profit, we have to get in there and rip it from them. A $1 billion profit can be a huge profit or it can be quite a small profit. We should not be talking about the profit, we should be talking about the return on investment. If you have invested $1 billion and made $1 million you have not really done very well, it is not a large return on investment. To have set an actual figure of $75 million is the most bizarre, fiscally irresponsible and completely ignorant way to approach this legislation. Why $75 million? As Senator Sterle said, if is $74.9 million you are all right. It will not matter whether you have invested $150 million or $10 billion to make that $75 million, you will still pay the tax. How bizarre, how completely outside any reality, any assessment.
One of the biggest issues, of course, is that mining expenditure is the cost a miner incurs in bringing the taxable resources to the valuation point—and the government still has not quite worked out how they are going to deal with the market issues they have developed there. In my own state of Queensland we are very lucky to have a strong flow of royalties from the mining industry—not just coal but particularly in the coal area with the Surat and Bowen basins. Nine per cent of Queensland government revenue currently comes from state royalties. But this is the boom, this is as good as it gets with getting money out of the mining industry. Everyone assumes that it will steady and then, over the next 50 or 60 years, begin to taper. Queensland is getting its cut, particularly out of the coal industry and many other industries, and they get nine per cent in royalties. So, Senator Sterle, while we are looking at how well Labor governments perform, you might want to ask: is the Queensland government in surplus? No, they are not in surplus. Have they had a downgrade of their credit rating in the last three years?
Senator Williams: Yes, yes!
Senator BOYCE: Yes, they have. So here we have an example yet again of how well Labor governments can perform if they have got good—
Senator Sterle interjecting—
The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT ( Senator Pratt ): Senator Sterle, come to order so that Senator Boyce may continue. Senator Boyce, you have the call.
Senator BOYCE: I am not quite sure what Senator Sterle is talking about. The coal seam gas industry will be a major contributor to Queensland's economy and has been a steady contributor to Queensland's economy for 50 years, Senator Sterle. Certainly there needs to be a balance, and thank goodness from next Saturday there will be an economically responsible government in Queensland under the premiership of Campbell Newman that will actually get the balance right between the development of coal seam gas and the protection of farm and food production areas. That may well be beyond the wit of Senator Sterle and his colleagues, but it is not beyond the wit of the LNP government that will be installed in Queensland next Saturday.
It is hard to think of a worse way to have gone about developing this legislation than the way this government has. We had the old super resource tax under former Prime Minister Rudd. A bizarre 287 pages of new tax law is what we have got out of this. As I said earlier, the introduction of the market valuation scheme to calculate applicable deductions gives the big three companies a significant tax shield that is not available to small- and mid-tier mining companies. There are small- and mid-tier mining companies. Every industry is relative. Certainly, if we are talking about milk bars, there are small milk bars and large milk bars, Senator Sterle, in the same way there are small mining companies and large mining companies. You would think that this government would be pleased that every one of those small mining companies is working assiduously to try to turn into a large mining company. That is what Australia's prosperity and the availability of jobs is based on. It is based on individuals who have worked furiously to go from being sole traders in many cases through to being national and multinational companies and there is nothing wrong with doing that. I must admit I was somewhat appalled by Senator Sterle's suggestion that apparently Ms Rinehart cannot have friends. The fact that both Senator Joyce and Mr Schultz have written to her children is on the public record.
Senator Sterle interjecting—
Senator BOYCE: It would have been better, you are dead right Senator Sterle, if all those family problems had stayed out of the spotlight and I think your contribution to keeping them out of the spotlight was hypocritical to say the very least. But what is the suggestion? Is it that Ms Rinehart cannot have friends? What is the suggestion? Is it that Mr Forrest and Mr Palmer cannot make the same attempts to—
Senator Sterle interjecting—
The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT ( Senator Pratt ): Order, Senator Sterle, Senator Boyce has the call.
Senator BOYCE: Every individual in Australia is entitled to do what they can to affect government policies, especially when they think it is wrong—every individual. I know Mr Craig Thomson and his mates certainly tried very hard. If you look at the Your Rights at Work campaign, I think we are talking here about a little more than some of the donations that Mr Palmer has made to the LNP. To suggest that making a donation is somehow equivalent to bribing people is a disgusting, dishonest comment to make, particularly given that we are talking here about individuals. These donations are well known and any results thereof are well documented so that you have a transparent and accountable system not like the insidious, incestuous relationship between the Labor Party and the unions where there is no accountability and Fair Work Australia apparently has to learn to read before they can work out how to produce a report sometime hopefully before the next election, although the likelihood of that, I would think, is very small.
I want to go back and mention the superannuation legislation and the so-called company tax cut that the government has tried to attach to the mining tax. They are not tax cuts; they are tax cons. In fact, if you look at some of the figures that have been produced recently over the weekend, you would have noticed an analysis that shows that, in the end, both the super changes and the company tax cuts will cost money because employers will end up in a negative situation. I would like to just remind the Senate what the Henry tax review said about the superannuation guarantee rate. It said:.
This is the government's own review, the Henry review of taxation, which said 'Leave it at nine per cent; don't change it.' We could ask Senator Sterle perhaps what Machiavellian movement went on behind the scenes because, when you think about it, who wanted a 12 per cent superannuation rate? Gee, who was that? Was that the union movement that was pushing for that, especially funded by people outside the wages system. 'Let's go find someone rich and get some money out of them' so that we can increase the superannuation guarantee above the rate that that Henry tax review says it needs to be to give people adequate incomes.
The coalition supports a reduction in the company tax rate. We do not support the mishmash, piecemeal approach yet again that this government is taking. 'What does it matter? We've distorted so many markets now' is the Labor government's mantra. 'What does it matter if we distort a few more? Let's go for a tax cut for small business and just ignore everybody else for a bit longer.'
It beggars belief and causes me great distress that this government might be in power for another 12 months. It is really worrying what else they can damage or destroy in that time. As I have said, the mining industry—and Treasurer Swan loves looking at averages—is the only thing that is masking the serious problems in manufacturing, in retail, in services, in building in Australia.
Senator Sterle interjecting—
The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT ( Senator Pratt ): Senator Boyce has the call. Senator Sterle, come to order.
Senator BOYCE: I am not sure which ideal little world Senator Sterle lives in, but most consumers when faced with a $50 Australian-made product and a $30 made-in-China product—Senator Sterle, do you know what happens? In most cases, they buy the made-in-China products, Senator Sterle. I think you need to go back to the bottom of this before you start worrying about where the wages come from. I know from personal experience that vast numbers of manufacturers are now importing some of their product. It was that or go out of business. Would that have been preferable in Senator Sterle's view? Because when he finds the consumers who are prepared to pay between 30 and 80 per cent more for a product so that they can buy an Australian-made product that will be fantastic. Vast numbers of products have to be imported because of the competition in the industry, and perhaps Senator Sterle should even look at the truck manufacturing business: Senator Sterle, how many of those are made here right now and used?
Senator Kim Carr: Quite a lot!
Senator BOYCE: Quite a lot, Yes, we must be over 15 per cent, are we, Senator Carr? It beggars belief that this government would continue in area after area to not give a damn about business and growing business to simply say, 'Wow, $75 million!' Irrespective of what that means as a return on investment, it does not matter. It does not matter if it is a one per cent return on investment or a 100 per cent return on investment, but 'Wow, if it's $75 million, you must be rich. You must be a really rich company, so we'll go and rip some money off you. We'll continue to distort the market even more.' Never mind that mining companies already pay high rates of corporate tax and pay the royalties to the states. Never mind that there is a legal question over whether the federal government can even tax what is state property: the coal and iron ore profits.
The Gillard government mining tax is divisive, complex, unfair, fiscally irresponsible and distorting. It reduces our international competitiveness and was developed through a highly flawed and improper process. It will damage our economy. It will in the long term be the sort of retrograde and extraordinarily inept process that we have come to expect from this government.

Hey folks,
So if you were/are a frequent visitor here – you might have noticed I haven’t posted in a while. The good news is that I’m still alive. The reason I haven’t been posting is because I’ve taken my passion for soccer to the next level and am now getting an MBA/MA degree in Sports Business Management. So I’ve been terribly busy but look forward to having the time again in the future to start posting again regularly.
In the meantime, I’m always sending out updates via de PasionNaranja twitter account: Twitter
So follow me there and hopefuly I can keep bringing you relevant news and commentary regarding the Islanders and soccer in Puerto Rico.

Hi everyone. I hope you are all having a great summer. It sure is zipping right along here. Back at the end of June I won a give away by Chris from NH. We are almost neighbors!! She was very generous in her giveaway. She had shown a table runner that she had made and quilted and hinted about something else saying to think jello! When I found that I had won, I was very excited. I loved the runner. I kept thinking about the jello. I was hoping that it would not be a gelatin salad in the summer!!! Well this is what Chris sent.
Some great NH maple syrup and maple candy. Yum!! A beautiful hand made card, that I did not photo very well. The card was made by Chris's daughter. Two old hankies. An old package of pins (love them). A quilting pattern that I love and a pin cushion in an old jello mold and....
The table runner. I love it. It goes really nice in my kitchen. Chris did a beautiful job of quilting the runner with all different kinds of fruits. I have some nice pictures of the quilting but blogger is not playing nice right now. I will post pictures of the quilting when blogger will allow me to. Thanks again Chris. I love everything. I will chat soon.

Excerpted from Human Events: They will say anything to win.
DNC Speaker and actress Kerry Washington told the crowd last night Republicans want to take away a women’s right to vote.
Unbelievable.
And, of course, the Democratic Party said nothing about her dishonest remarks.
The Politico has the transcript:.
<|endofexample|>
“The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace” (pontificates idiotically The Economist’s “Old battles, new Middle East“). More prosaically, anti-missile systems were tested. Iron Dome intercepted 425+ Gaza missiles.
There cannot be peace in the Middle East, as long as Islam is the dominant system of mood. Islam started as an anti-Jewish machine: Muhammad turned against his hosts, who had inspired him, and massacred an entire tribe in mostly Jewish Yathrib (thereafter to be called Medina, the second most sacred city in Islam).
Faithfully following Roman and Roman Catholic genocidal fascism, Islam put its foot on Jerusalem’s bloodied face, insulting it as the third most sacred city in Islam:
In 1217 CE, Spanish Rabbi Judah al-Harizi found the sight of the Muslim fortifications on the Jewish Temple Mount profoundly disturbing. “What torment to see our holy courts converted into an alien temple!”
Jerusalem had been the capital of various Jewish states for about 2,000 years. 2,000 years prior to the invention of Islam.
Islam has no less than two mosques on top of the most sacred place of Judaism. Those mosques were built (late 8th C), 13 (yes, thirteen) centuries after the destruction of the first Jewish temple by the Babylonians. It’s worse than rising mosques on top of a razed Notre Dame, while calling Paris the fourth most sacred city in Islam.
Muhammad is supposed to have taken flight from there, the Jewish Temple mount, in an apparent imitation of the thoroughly undocumented Christ (many turkeys fly from the same spot). The vampire gorged on blood takes flight from the neck of its victim.
Islam was also an anti-Western war machine, and, as long as it functions as a dominant mode of thinking of Middle Earth, and the West has not been defeated, there will be war. We have plenty of (sacred) statements in the Hadith about attacking the West deliberately. Bukhari is the second most authoritative source in Islam after the Qur’an:
“He heard the Prophet saying, ‘Paradise is granted to the first batch of my followers who will undertake a naval expedition.’ The Prophet then said, ‘The first army amongst my followers who will invade Caesar’s City will be forgiven their sins.’” [Bukhari:V4B52N175]
So much for Islam being a religion of peace. Muslims sieged Constantinople three times: 674-678 CE, 717-718 CE, and 1453 CE.
On August 28, 846 CE an Arab army invaded Rome by surprise, and took over the Vatican. Yes, the Muslims succeeded where Hannibal had failed. One never talks about it, prefering to call attention to Hannibal and the Crusades, always (an obvious bias in context building!). This attack on Rome was no joke: the Frankish army holding north-west Rome and the Vatican was killed to the last man. The Muslims in and around Rome were repelled after hard fighting over several months, by Frankish relief armies.
Arab invasions rolled over Europe for 1,000 years, coming not far from Paris more than once, sieging Vienna, twice, occupying Saint Tropez, much of Provence, Switzerland, Greece, much of Italy, for decades, sometimes centuries… Exerting their obnoxious oppression all along (non Muslims were strongly discriminated against, in many ways, and had to submit, lest they would be summarily executed; marks on clothing akin to the Nazis’ yellow star had to be worn by the non Muslims; Muslim warriors could grab maidens and decide that was a “battlefield marriage” [institutionalized rape] but non Muslims men could not marry a Muslim, something true to this day, etc.).
.’“ [Bukhari:V4B52N267]
“Umar [the Second Caliph].’” [Bukhari:V4B53N386]
It’s all about the luxurious life: be a martyr, and luxury is yours, you greedy murderous ones! It’s not me parodying Islam saying this. It’s the most sacred texts of Islam defining Islam thus. Notice the quotes are long, their contexts clear. But we have to be careful: nowadays, just describing the Prophet, as he is described in the Qur’an and the Hadith, is viewed as a grave insult against the prophet, even if all and any Muslim scholars know these very things are the basics of the Islamist faith. In other words, Islamist “scholars” view Islam as an insult against islam, as long as it is described by non Muslims.
For all the pillow talk about peace in the Middle East, Islam is the pachyderm from hell breathing over the bed in the room above the whispering lovers. The Middle East has not yet been separated from its local, plutocratic friendly, superstition, Islam. Islam, as it is, truly, not as it is hoped to be by pseudo-progressives who have made a business model from mouthing wishful thinking, as a form of soft intellectual fascism.
Let’s all read the Qur’an, line by line. It’s only 80,000 words, everybody, even pseudo-progressives, with their tiny brains, could do it. Maybe too busy self caressing pseudo-progressives are?
What do we see in the Qur’an? A repetitive litany of lethal or abusive orders (from God, no less!) many victimizing people who are accused of misinterpreting God, such as the Jews, Christians, ill defined “unbelievers”, etc.
Apparently unsatisfied with murderously intolerant fanaticism, the Qur’an is clearly not friendly to democracy. Allah wants the faithful to obey whoever detains power: “O Ye Who Believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and OBEY THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE IN POWER.” (Sura 4; verse 59).”
Thus the Qur’an makes fascism part of worship. No wonder all leaders in Islamist countries become dictators (even Erdogan in Turkey is trying his best).
Thus Islam or democracy and peace? That is the question in the Middle East, still stuck in theocracy, 13 centuries and going strong.

WHEN EUROPE WAS UNDER THE SPELL OF WOULD BE CHILD ASSASSIN ABRAHAM, IT WAS NOT PRETTY EITHER:
Superstition going crazy is not confined to the Middle East. Europe has know two phases of murderous insane superstitionism. The first religious madness put an end to Romanitas, an ill fated, all too restrictive society that could survive only by ever augmenting its fascism, while fragmenting into mini tyrannies from local plutocrats.
Diseased Romanitas was replaced by the more advanced Frankish philosophy which included in the power structure of society Jews, Pagans, women, all sorts of Germans, Romans, and even the ex-slaves.
The ugly oppression of the Abrahamic religion went into an eclipse that lasted six centuries. (Nothing symbolized it better than the nationalization of the church by Charles Martel around 730 CE!)
However, the Crusades allowed Abraham to rise its ugly snout again. The cult of a child molester does the plutocratic mood wonders. One Crusade, in France, killed one million. One million French. Or more. For five or six centuries plutocrats, hiding behind Abraham’s throat cutting ways, were at each others’ throats.
The Europe was torn by terrible religious wars over a century centered on 1600 CE. France had no less than eight religious wars at the end of the 16th Century.
Some of these wars caused the death of more than 30% of the population. Before weapons of mass destruction. Finally central governments won the struggle, and took over, re-birthing (re-naissance) the Roman style command and control.
The religious murderous madness was stopped when religion got defanged, and rigorously separated from the state, while the Republic became the ruling religion. Not yet the case in the Middle East… Except for Israel (paradoxically).

CLASH OF A SUPERSTITION WITH CIVILIZATION:
Make no mistake: between Israel and the Arabs, at this point, it is still a religious war. No peace is possible as long as temple based terrorism lurks above.
The Economist, in an orgasm of naivety, urges Obama to do something about Israel and Palestine. But what to do against superstition and fanaticism? It’s a philosopher’s task. The best one can expect from Obama is Machiavellism. And we are getting some.
Obama is right to not squander his time splitting superstitious hair in a finer way than the fanatical participants already do. Obama got involved, sure. Obama very wisely decided that the USA would finance most of the Iron Dome (in exchange for a technology transfer!). It was wise. Iron Dome, and the coming David Sling will do more to calm down fascism, than soothing words of debasing appeasement.
Once democracy, the people, rules, there will be peace. But the people has existed for a million years, and the Republic is its basic religion, its basic atavism. No objective observer can say it is compatible with burning people for all the litany of reasons found in the Qur’an.
Seven centuries ago, in Egypt, interpreting the Qur’an literally was punished with imprisonment. Time to reboot that, if peace is really what one is after.

QUR’AN BAD, BIBLE WORSE: SO?
The Economist published my comment above. The anonymous L6QjhvJGVk in reply to Tyranosopher Nov 23rd, came up with a number of interesting quotes of the Bible. Said he: “Although I am not religious (as an agnostic), the Koran is very mild compared to the Bible.”
Right, L6QjhvJGVk, but the Bible does not have more than a billion fanatical followers, today. Literal Bible reading is mostly a problem confined to places in Russia, the USA and Israel. One can spit all day long on the Bible, and burn it with gusto. All that will happen is that one will not be taken seriously. But in Muslim lands, it’s quite the opposite, one is taken all too seriously. Doing symbolic violence to the Qur’an hate book may get you executed. Once somebody was condemned to death, in a Muslim country, for having said something unbecoming about Jesus (!), a prophet of Islam.
Even in countries such as France, supposedly philosophically enlightened, there is a dangerous confusion between criticizing a religion, and racial hatred (are the somewhat Christianophobic, such as me, hating the Christian race?). This legal confusion has had very practical, very disastrous consequences. It enabled the growth of Muslim Fundamentalism of the lethal type, because criticizing the Qur’an, arguably a hate book if there ever has been one, has been equated to racism. Thus Quranic violence was made into something sacred.
It is a bit of a paradox that it is honorable to kill bin Laden, but not to trash his ideas! In contrast, I believe that the best way to kill inferior ideas is with superior ideas.
L6QjhvJGVk Bible and Jewish quotes are reproduced in the comments (however, within them L6QjhvJGVk exhibits plain anti-Judaism, Nazi style, as he evokes a word Hitler used, “genetic” in derogatory relation to the Jews, showing an emotional anti-Jew slant).
***
Left and Right. in reply to L6QjhvJGVk Nov 23rd, 09:23 observed:
“There is no comparison [between following the Bible and being submitted to the Qur'an]. The Bible is advisory and there are no penalties to deny or question it. Islam requires a total belief in the whole of the Koran as directly written by Allah. To question it or to deny it is apostasy the penalty for which is death. This can tend to remove the chance to discuss things rationally. The poor performance, educationally, socially and economically of Muslims is, I believe hindered by the absolving of personal responsibility with the need to suffix every statement with Inshallah, if God wills it, in my experience he seldom does. My Muslin dentist tells me the world in 6000 years old, as stated in the Koran – well this could explain the dearth of Nobel Scientific awards to Muslims. Oh for the enlightenment!”
I agree 100% with Left and Right. Except that the Roman emperors, even before Theodosius, imposed Catholic terror (loosely based on the New Testament).
The reason for constant Muslim civil wars of the worst type is precisely that to question the other believer’s interpretation of the Qur’an or to deny it is apostasy, as far as the other believer is concerned, the penalty for which is death. Hence the total intolerance of Muslim: just draw a guy with a turban, call it Muhammad, see what happens. You may not have time to put it below foot. Thus the Dome of the Rock’s location is a well understood insult.
***
Attendant Lord in reply to L6QjhvJGVk Nov 23rd:
“You overlook that the portions of these religious books that reflect values from another time are dead as a doornail in Judaism and in Israel, a modern state with modern values, and alive and well under Islamist states, whose leadership believes that it should all be kept alive, just as it was written.”
***
Thank you L6QjhvJGVk, for rolling out barbarity from the Bible, there are never enough rivers of obnoxious data flowing to nourish the humanistic, progressive ocean!
The Abrahamic religion has to be crushed always. A state came up with the following law: “The safety and security of the Commonwealth cannot be achieved apart from reliance upon Almighty God.” Those who disagree are to be sent to jail 12 months. That’s the law since before 2006, when the Supreme Court of that state refused to consider its constitutionality. So it is in Kentucky, USA.
If the Abrahamists, with their psycho god, are not crushed there, they will grow under the sign of the beast, and eat civilization up, as they did in the East. As when Bush brandished Qur’an and Bible to bring the true faith to Iraq (in his self described “crusade“).
Islamism is just a variant, an heresy of Judaism, somewhat desertified, somewhat Christianized, somewhat modernized. So if the Bible is really bad, it’s only natural that the Qur’an would be so too. Since the latter mostly apes the former.
(The holly Qur’an can be innovative, though: Apparently Muhammad conceived of stem cells, demonstrating how wise he was! Qur’an Surah 4, Verse 56: “Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses – We will drive them into a Fire. Every time their skins are roasted through We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment again. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted in Might and Wise.”)
As a self declared follower of the Abrahamic religion, the Prophet venerated the Bible, and his beef with the Jews was that they did not follow the Bible rigorously enough.
That the Bible was grotesquely dangerous, and immoral, interpreted literally has been known since the birth of Christianity.
Wrote Augustine: Title of Book III, Chapter 5 of his famous City of God”. “It Is A Wretched Slavery Which Takes The Figurative Expressions of Scripture in A Literal Sense.”
In spite of this, Augustine was the first theoretician of the dispersal of the Jews out of Israel, thus causing their departure, followed by their subsequent return…
Of course Augustine (around 400 CE) was following emperor Hadrian’s decrees against the Jews, like the dog follows his master. After the second Jewish revolt, in 132 CE, the Romans defeated the Jewish army in 135 CE.
Thereupon, Jerusalem, the capital of he Jews, was turned into a Greco-Roman city called Aelia Capitolina. A temple of Jupiter was built on top of the Jewish Temple, razed by the Romans.
Thus the idea of putting the enormous Dome of the Rock in place of the Temple is a Roman fascist idea that has become sacred to Muslims! In other words, of Rome, Muslims worship the worst. Another troubling fact, is that the Temple Mount is also considered to be Mount Zion. does that mean that, by worshipping the Dome of the Rock (roughly the oldest mosque), Muslims are Zionists? In some sense?
Emperor Hadrian forbid to the Jews to live in Jerusalem. Hadrian changed the country’s name from Judea to Syria Palestina. United Nations, version 135 CE.
However, these atrocious facts over which the otherwise much esteemed Hadrian presided, got to be known, and taken for what they were, in the fullness of time: genocide.
By 1948 CE, the United Nations, a sort of modernized Rome (before the Roman Republic became an outright imperium), decided to undo the horror visited by Hadrian, and more or less enforced ever since.
Actually the UN followed a Roman precedent. Emperor Julian, philosopher and critique of the monstrosity of the rule of Catholicism, had ordered the RECONSTRUCTION of the Jewish Temple in 360 CE (earthquakes, and Christian fanaticism, including the assassination of Julian, prevented the work to proceed!)
So here we are. In the last seven years, the Palestinians have fired nearly 7,000 rockets at Israel, killing 51 Israelis, and losing nearly 3,200 of their own. “Israel is gaining time… cutting the grass“, as Israelis put it. The time Israel did not have in 132-135 CE.
History never dies. Only armies do.
Why don’t Muslims eat pigs? The first order explanation, like for most things Muslim is that, so it was in the Bible, and Muslims follow the Bible, when in doubt. More sophisticated was Maimonides, the Jewish philosopher under the Caliphate, physician to Saladin in the Twelfth Century. He understood the dietary laws chiefly as keeping the body healthy. The meat of the forbidden animals, birds, and fish was indigestible, according to Maimonides. However this does not apply to pork, he observed. But pigs are more dirty than human latrines, so had to be avoided, he obviated.
A beauty of Islam is that it has no centralized authority as far as what it truly says. As the Qur’an is very small, it has been supplemented by all sorts of books and gossip, the Sunnah and Hadith being the most prominent. Muslims tend to kill each other, because they differ about the authors of Hadith who are viewed as reputable. Or by how seriously they take this and that gossip (= “reputable authority“, a frequently used notion in Islam scholarship).
On top of that, local traditions have their own little stories. Once I asked a knowledgeable woman in Africa, a Muslim religious authority, why Muslims did not eat pigs.
She told me a story I have never come across again. She told me that once Muhammad and his army, in a forest, got very thirsty. Then they saw a pig. They followed it until it reached water. Thereafter, a grateful Muhammad ordered his followers to give pigs a chance.
The surrealism of it all left me speechless. So some black Africans hold that Muslims follow the one who followed the pig? It’s unlikely that blindly following the One who followed the pig will give peace a chance, because he gave pigs a chance. The fascist instinct, that is, following The One, in this case a long dead analphabet raider, blindly, is exactly the opposite of peace, pigs or no pigs.
Yesterday’s god, like yesterday’s history, is senile, incoherent, repetitive, and dangerous. Time to break the cycle. Otherwise, there is an Iron Dome to show you.

New Roll Developed
A Park in Scottsdale, AZ, July 2008
One of the things I really like about film are the differences in the ‘look’ of one film to another. While there certainly are Lightroom presets that mimic film types, to my eye the differences go beyond the contrast curve and the response to color and the grain. I’ve collected Lightroom presets galore, but sometimes (like today) an image just pops out of the scanner and hits me upside the head.
This is TMAX 400. It was developed by the local lab. When I shot this last summer, I hadn’t yet mastered by development techniques (not that they are mastered yet) but I was especially nervous about TMAX. This roll came out so lovely that I am going to ask them what time/temp/developer combination they used.
This image isn’t anything award-winning, but the overall tonality just caught my eye. The Lightroom Preset conversions for TMAX just don’t do it justice. I’m going to have to get more of this film and experiment. I wouldn’t use it for the same things as HP5 (street photography), but more for landscapes, I think. I have a roll of TMAX 100 that I developed in FG7 that is waiting to be scanned. We’ll see how that came out.
Chris, this is really very nice. The white clouds in the reflection took my eye right up the scene to the “beach” and tress. Very nice contrast as well.
P.S. Sorry, I forgot. I used Nik Silver Pro for a trial and whilst I think it’s a good program I didn’t think it really captured the look of tri-x, so I tend to agree with what you write about above.

Smores Mini Cupcakes.
I love s’mores - especially on a summer night at a beach bonfire surrounded by old friends. Theres just something about the delectable combination of melted chocolate and marshmallow with a graham cracker.

2. Sift 1 cup sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer. Fitted with the paddle attachement, mix together.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla. Add to flour mixture on low speed and mix just until combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides and continue to mix for another 2 minutes. Add boiling water and whisk by hand to avoid any splashing.
4. In a separate bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and remaining 1/8 sugar. Using a tsp., spoon one tsp. into each cupcake liner and push down lightly with the back of the teaspoon.
5. Bake graham cracker lined cupcakes in oven for about 5 minutes.
6. Remove from oven and add chocolate cupcake batter 3/4 full in each cupcake. Sprinkle cupcakes with remaining graham cracker crumbs. Bake for 15 minutes, until a toothpick tester comes out clean.
For the Marshmallow Frosting:
Ingredients:
2 egg whites, at room temperature
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 tsp. cream of tartar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
Directions:
1. Place egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar in the heatproof mixing bowl of an electric stand mixer. Hold over a saucepan with simmering water and whisk by hand for about 3 minutes until sugar melts and is no longer grainy between the fingertips.
2. With electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachement, whisk starting at low speed and gradually increase to high. Whisk until stiff peaks form. This will take about 7 minutes. Add vanilla extract and mix just until combined. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a star or french tip.
Assembly:
Using a piping bag, ice the marshmallow onto cooled cupcakes. Using a blow torch, torch the top to mimik lightly melted marshmallow. Add a mini marshmallow to garnish and serve!
Don’t be fooled by the seemingly long list of ingredients. This is actually an easy recipe and if you have a large measuring cup, you can mix the wet ingredients all in that measuring cup so this whole recipe is actually like a one bowl cupcake. This is sure to impress.

A few minutes ago, one of my Twitter friends asked a really great question.
My answer actually surprised me. A lot.
Having grown up in extreme poverty, I’ve always almost worn it on my sleeve with a profound sense of pride. Mostly because I was able to do things everyone said I couldn’t. I was/am proud of my accomplishments. I overcame a lot to get to a place of comfort. Not riches, mind you, just comfort.
Because of many other things that happened in my life, I never pursued money. I pursued knowledge. And the price of big paychecks never appealed to me. I’ve never respected people with money. In fact, I have a lot of disdain for them–which has both served me and gotten in my way.
A few years back, after thinking I’d left that old life behind–that I was finally stable and could breathe–I had some major financial setbacks. It was every worst nightmare I’d ever had since crawling out of all of it. I didn’t think I’d survive it. It tore up my entire sense of identity. But, in a strange way, it also rebuilt it and made me a lot better at working and staying true to me. I was really fortunate to get back on my feet, and I found a new confidence I never thought I had. I became unshakably convinced that I could survive anything. And it also made me rethink the things I used to think about work and money.
###
For me, money has always been a necessary evil. I’ve often wished for more so life would be less complicated. I have conflicting views about work and its connection to money. For my parents, and my grandparents, money was a means to an end. It meant we survived or we didn’t. Lacking money meant suffering indignities and working harder than most people could imagine. Work was the way to get money. It didn’t matter what you did–just that you did something that brought in enough to pay the bills. On-time. That’s it.
Work was not your life. It was not something you did into the wee hours. It was not worthy of overtime or mental anguish. It was getting up every day at 6 am, leaving at 7 am, and coming home at 5 pm. You didn’t make friends with your co-workers. You endured it. That’s it. And when you left, that’s when your real life began. Simple.
I was never of that school. For me, money meant I got what I needed. It meant I could learn. It meant I was exposed to people and places and things I’d never see if I didn’t have money. You worked to get money, sure–but working hard was also payment…in an odd way. Work meant approval. It meant exploring ideas and seeing what your talents were. It meant being seen.
I’ve never really liked work, but masochist that I am–I really like working once I’m stuck there. I find myself having a good time, in spite of all of it. It doesn’t really matter what it is. I like challenges. Mostly, I like doing things. No one has to tell me what to do. If I’m there, I’ll work hard. It’s who I am. If I’m loyal to you–if you’ve been kind–I will run myself into the ground to help you. If you’ve disrespected me, I’ll work as hard as a normal person–but trust that it’s not my normal–and you could get a lot more if you just said thank you.
My mother used to say I care too much. About what others think of me. About what I’m doing and what it all means. About the things things aren’t. I don’t like doing just anything. I like to know why. If I can connect to it, I’m happy. If I feel like a robot, I’m not.
I’ve struggled most of my life to find my calling. That right thing that would fill me up. That thing that wouldn’t feel hard. That thing that would pay my bills without stealing my life. I’ve made mistakes in this. I’ve compromised too much, only to believe too much in things that weren’t mine. Only to stumble into things that made sense. And then compromise for the meantime because there is always more work to do before I’m at the top of the stairs.
A girl’s gotta eat. And not die.
I don’t know what the answers are for me. I’d like to think I do, and that I’m doing them.
I am not ashamed of my past poverty–or even afraid of it anymore–though it took me a very long time to be able to say that. And that poverty? Well, it still lives inside me and can cut me sometimes if I’m not careful. Poverty can trick you into thinking you’re something you’re not. And it can make others believe it too.
I’m still amazed by how insidious it is.
It is not noble to be poor. Sometimes, I think I thought that. That I was somehow a better person just for that reason. But, I’ve learned there are some nice rich folk with morals who aren’t so bad. Though I probably will judge them when I first meet them.
There is nothing wrong with money or having enough. There is nothing wrong with admitting being poor is terrifying, and you’d rather have money. Because it opens doors and gives you choices. I will admit that.
I’d never exchange my life for some rich person’s. I gained so much knowledge of human nature and myself. But I wish it would have been easier for my Mama. I wish all of it wasn’t so hard and didn’t linger like moldy cheese. I wish I could help people who are in the situation I used to be in.
I don’t believe in either/or anymore. I don’t believe that work is everything or nothing. I believe, maybe foolishly, that I can work hard and still take a lunch break. And it will be okay. Though a past me probably objects. Vehemently. I don’t believe I have to hate my job to earn a living if it’s not my purpose. I think you can do things just because you need to, and it’ll be okay. But if you set yourself up to hate it, you absolutely will. I believe that–if something really does matter to you–but pays you nothing and doesn’t take care of you–it’s probably not what you’re meant to do. And if it really is something you’re meant to do–you will find a way to use it to meet your needs. Sometimes, it takes time and creativity. And working 14 hour days. But you can change what your life is like. You just have to figure out what the needs are and ask the Universe to meet them.
###
I say all of this at the end of one of the worst weeks of my professional life. I’m working a job to get me somewhere else. And I don’t mind it–or, at least, I haven’t minded it for the better part of a couple years. But life changes, and you find yourself elsewhere–and you have to change, too. All of this stuff lands on you when you’re not standing up inside yourself. And, for many reasons, I haven’t been. But I did yesterday and today. And I changed things inside myself and rethought this in between. And let’s just say more change is coming. And it may actually surprise me. And it may make the rest of it make sense.
I had the urge earlier today to write something in tribute to my Mama. To tell you about her. But haven’t I been doing that every single day since she left me?
I had the urge to write a letter to her. But what more can I say–what can I say that I haven’t said already?
And how, exactly, do you convey how important someone’s existence was to you?
I don’t know. For me, there is not intentional anything here. Every moment of my life, I simply live it: a humble–yet healthy–dose of gratitude for that woman who fought for me every single day of my life–even before she knew I could exist.
I could tell you all these stories about her–stories that would make you love her in some weaker way than I do. Because who could love her more than me?
I could describe all the million things I loved about her. But, some ways, that would diminish her.
My life, truth be told, is just one big conversation with–about–for–her.
I guess that’s all I really need to say.
The weekend is slowly inching away, and I’m already feeling Monday’s unwanted arrival. I’m a little exhausted. Yesterday was my first real “outing” since my surgery–other than medical appointments. We ended up in my old neighborhood–for a breakfast of banh mi and mango boba. Then, to one of the local Asian markets for boba I can make myself, at home (since I’ve been craving them so much lately). I can’t really walk long distances or stand for long periods of time right now, so I ended up eating my food in the parking lot–people-watching–while J went in.
I’ve been missing home for a while now. It’s been worse since my surgery. That feeling of familiarity and comfort is what seems to motivate it. It was nice to sit in the parking lot–watching a little boy doing tai chi…an old man–all bent over–conversing with his daughter in Vietnamese…and the people driving insane hoopties through the parking lot. Such a departure from the life I have been living–where everyone is so generic and mannered. It was nice to feel the breeze on my face–even if I couldn’t browse the huge tea aisle or spend hours trying to identify obscure products.
We then went up to Boulder, for the farmer’s market, and got stuck in traffic. At first, we thought it was the construction on 36–or maybe graduation weekend–but then noticed the traffic got better after we passed a bunch of cows. We joked that everyone was slowing down to look at all the cows. Welp–as it turns out–these were fugitive cows on the lam.
Boulder was crowded. Even with many of the students gone. It was a gorgeous day. I got a tie-dye bandana. Because: Boulder. We stopped at Pekoe for more boba–jasmine milk tea this time–my current fave. And then, we went to Estes–stopping at the pie store for cherry pie–as always–hoping the sky would stop with the rain. It rained a lot yesterday–but mostly off and on, with rainbows.
Despite Trail Ridge’s closure, we had a pretty good time–touring some burn areas and seeing quite a few magpies, elk, and deer. It made me want to go camping and reminded me of the close association between life/death–and how beautiful the tragic can be. Around mid-day, I was pretty much a zombie, so we cut it all short and came home. Which was also interesting because whatever dam I’ve built up these past few weeks seemed to break a bit. I rounded out the night by watching the original Great Gatsby, asleep before it was even over.
At 4 am, my phone starting buzzing–practically nonstop. Forty bizarre texts and two missed calls later, I was pretty annoyed–called the person in question–talked to him to see if he was okay and was convinced he was high or unbelievably drunk. He assured me he was okay. I was pretty pissed about the whole thing. Especially since sunrise happened a few minutes later, and I was definitely not going back to sleep.
Hours later, we started unraveling the puzzle of his last night and can only think he was roofied at a local bar. He had random scrapes on him and looked like he’d been punched in the face. He also couldn’t seem to string thoughts together–hours later–and is missing most of last night from his memory. Scary shit.
Oh, and our power went out, too–which also pissed me off because some construction peeps caused it again. This pretty much happens every weekend, so I wasn’t’ really amused. SO, I’m a bit tired and unnerved. And, then–of course–it’s Mama’s Day. Which isn’t exactly easy.
For Mama’s Day, I wanted to share some photos from yesterday. There’s too many to post all of them, so there will be more in a few days. It’s been a while since I’ve taken photos with my DSLR. (I actually almost forgot how to change lenses!). Here’s hoping your day is going a bit better than mine, and you can actually hug your Mama today. If you can’t, consider this a big ole hug from someone who gets it. <3

Okay, I wish I could figure out how to make all of the above bigger and sparkly, but my brain is completely fried.
Why?
I’ve been on the phone all day today, and I’m still going strong. A week’s worth of work in one day? Heck yes. Outpacing my whole team in one day? Heck yes.
But it’s Friday, and HOLY HELL did I need it to be Friday.
So, that’s all you’re getting from me. A big fat smile. Just squint and then stretch your eyeballs really big and it’ll almost be as big as the smile on my face.
And, yes, I AM silently cackling.
Like a ninja.
Or a hermit crab.
With a cape.
I might drink an actual beer today (yay, peche lambic!) and I’m definitely eating a beautiful grilled cheeseburger with sriracha and bacon aioli. And, perhaps–if I feel fancy–some PIE.
This will be my first beer of this year. I am slightly scared. Tomorrow: Boulder and the farmer’s market. And pictures. Whee. I get to leave the apartment!!
Take that, surgical scars.
I’m back.
It happened in December of 2004.
She died–passed. All those words that mean she is just not here.
Over the years, I’ve had many conversations with people who have survived the loss of their parents. All of us walk around this planet with war wounds, trying desperately to figure out what our lives are about now–who we are now–who we can be now…how we can continue without them.
For me, my Mama was everything. My best friend. My constant ally and cheerleader. A big pain in my ass, too. But someone who witnessed every part of who I was–good, bad, amazing, ugly, perfect. She was there for every moment that meant something, and most of the ones that didn’t too.
Until a few days before my Mama actually got sick, the idea of her being human–vulnerable, truly sick–never ever crossed my mind. I was a naive 26 year old, still wet behind the ears (as she often said), and I had enough knowledge to navigate many different places. But, in the end, I relied on my Mama for so many things. Her leaving left a massive hole, and–nearly nine years later (wow)–I’m still grasping.
I tell people it will never be okay. It won’t get better or easier. I will miss her every day of my life–notice that she’s not here–want to share something with her. Not even one day. Missing her accompanies every shitty moment and every amazing moment. It doesn’t matter. I tell people it gets different.
Every day, every year–Hell, sometimes every hour. I have no idea how I’ll feel about things that were okay a year ago or even yesterday. The grief surges and reclines at its own whim. It doesn’t matter how long ago it was. In fact, often, the more time that passes, the worse it feels.
I am better at coping with it, though. I am (usually) able to feel it coming. On those days when I feel off and don’t know why, I hibernate–if I can. I have tools that make the feelings easier to swallow.
But sometimes, it still gets me when I don’t expect it. When I have no idea it’s coming.
When I went to bed last night, I wasn’t really thinking of Mama. Or anything except decompressing from one helluva shitty day. I was exhausted. I vaguely remembered Mama’s Day was coming this Sunday–but only because I started getting Mama’s Day emails several days ago from retailers (and eff you to the people who write those emails–seriously–so insensitive). It didn’t bother me. I might have bristled about the unwanted email before hitting unsubscribe, but other than that–unlike many other years–it didn’t sit with me.
And yet, I dreamt about her–something bizarre. The bizarre dreams are rare nowadays and having her in my dream–face-to-face for a long time…the star…welp…that’s also rare. Of course, I woke up a second before my alarm. Then, the roomie came in to make sure I heard my alarm. And I growled about sleeping 15 more minutes. Only no one would let me get those 15. I wanted so much to see her again–to go back to sleep for 15 minutes and see her.
I finally gave up, realizing that 15 minutes of some projected fantasy produced in my brain wouldn’t make her any less dead. I was too awake for that.
But it stuck with me today–through yet another aggravating day…and I realized that I dreamt about her because I’m starved for that relationship–for feeling that close to someone. Not much I can do about it, but there it is: another reason to grieve.

BOSTON, USA: The market value for GaAs revenues, driven by smartphones and consumer adoption of data-intensive applications, has grown strongly from the lows it struggled for in early 2009.
The recently published Strategy Analytics GaAs and Compound Semiconductors (GaAs) report, “GaAs Device Vendor Market Share 2009: North America,” reports that this growth brought the total market value for GaAs revenues to little more than $4 billion, a slight increase over 2008 revenue levels.
Skyworks Solutions nudged past RFMD to take the top revenue spot for North American vendors. However, less than one percent market share separates both companies. TriQuint and Avago Technologies both recorded strong revenue growth, substantially gaining on industry leaders.
“Even though revenue from the GaAs market in 2009 was only slightly higher than 2008, the story that emerges is the strong industry recovery during the last three-quarters of the year,” noted Eric Higham, Director of the Strategy Analytics GaAs and Compound Semiconductor Service.
“This growth is driven by consumer demand for new data-intensive applications, smartphones and the infrastructure that supports these capabilities. We expect these drivers to continue fueling growth through 2010.”

Old Things
I like old things. Consequently, I have a lot of old things in my house. Many belonged to my mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. Everything in this post is at least sixty years old—or much older.
One of the oldest things I have is this rocking chair made by my great-great-grandfather, John C. Nace. It's been painted many colors, but I think the original was green. Last year I painted it green again. The cushion on the seat belonged to my grandmother. I remember that cushion from when I was a kid.
The little rocking chair sits in front of the window in my study. Sometimes a cat naps in it.
This glass jar was the Mama's cookie jar when I was a kid. I remember it sat on her dish cabinet. The flowers on it are decals. Now it sits on my kitchen counter.
This little green gizmo is an orange juicer. I remember Mama making my orange juice with it when I was little. That was way before you could buy juice from concentrate. I haven't used the juicer for a couple of decades.
The items below were Grandma's. She once told me that she got the blue carnation vase at a "Christmas tree" at church when she was young. The candleholder is one of a pair. I can remember seeing them at Grandma's house but the candles were never ever lit. I don't know if there's a story behind the smaller vase, but it's also one of a pair. The glass is from a set.
I remember seeing the pink pitcher and glasses displayed in Grandma's dining room. As far as I know, they were never used. They haven't been used since I've owned them, either. I do remember eating off the plates behind them, though.
This teapot, sugar bowl, and creamer used to sit on the library table in Grandma's parlor. It has "Made in Japan" stamped on the bottom. I have no idea how old it is, but it's older than I am. It has never been used.
I think Mama acquired the milk glass rooster and hen when I was a kid. The ceramic stage coach and the Indian couple used to sit on the what-not stand. I think they're older than I am.
The white vase is old. Mama used it many times when I was a kid. The teapot, sugar, and creamer were given to her by a next-door neighbor when I was nine or ten. Mama never used them. They were for decorative display purposes only.
These canning jars belonged to my great grandmother, and they now hold a collection of old buttons. When clothing was cut up for quilts—or was too worn out for further use—the buttons would be cut off and saved for possible re-use. I inherited several boxes of buttons. I figured I'd display them in the jars.
This little glass vase was Grandma's. It sat on the library table in her parlor . . .
. . . as did this little double vase that's carved out of something. Soapstone? It looks similar to this one, but it has no identifying marks on it at all. Both sit near the button jars on top of a bookcase in my living room.
I've never used some of these old things, but I like to look at them and remember where they used to be.

All those things are beautiful! You're so lucky to have them. Love the green glass. I collect that. I think the Japanese set is lustreware. The teapot set with the flower could be majolica--not sure but at any rate, I think it's special. The white vase is art pottery and very collectible today. The last piece might be jade. I know it comes in different colors. Loved seeing your old things. It's nice that you value them!

For the third time in slightly more than a month, an Alaskan has died while taking part in outdoor recreation, only this time it was in the Caribou Hills.
"It can end real fast when people aren't prepared for the worst," said Ryan Browning, an Alaska State Trooper posted in Anchor Point.
The first of the spring mortalities was Royce Herbert Morgan, 18, of Anchorage, who died of hypothermia due to environmental exposure on Feb. 25 when he became separated from his brother while snowboarding in Hatcher Pass. The second was Yancy Flair, 35 of Anchorage, who died when he was buried in an avalanche while snowmachining in Johnson Pass on March 28.
The most recent accidental death involved Bryan W. Farrow, 47, of Homer, who was last seen alive on April 3, when leaving a Greer Road residence at around noon. Riding on a 1989 Yamaha Phazer snowmachine, his intention reportedly was to visit a friend living near Caribou Lake, about 20 miles away.
He never made it.
A neighbor reported Farrow missing to Alaska State Troopers on the evening of April 7. An extensive search of the Caribou Hills trail system was launched. Helo 1, a trooper helicopter, and two fixed-wing aircraft, one from the troopers and another from the Civil Air Patrol, conducted air searches of the area.
Meanwhile, friends and neighbors joined searchers from the Central Emergency Services in Soldotna and Snowmads, a snowmachine club from Homer, to comb the area trails on snowmachines and on foot.
On Friday at approximately 3:40 p.m., Farrow's body was located by Civil Air Patrol search flight members. It was found about 1.5 miles west of Caribou Lake.
"The body has been recovered. We went out in Helo 1 and got him. We wanted to get him out of there and back to his family," Browning said.
Farrow was described as an experienced outdoorsman and snowmachiner, who was dressed for cold weather.
"He had on Carhartts, and a hat and gloves, and he had a Leatherman. He was dressed warm, but not with anything waterproof," Browning said.
Farrow also did not have proper gear to overnight in Caribou Hills.
Due to closing extreme weather, searchers did not locate Farrow's snowmachine, so the circumstances that led to him being on foot are still unclear.
"It's possible he may have wrecked or gotten stuck and was trying to walk out," Browning said.
There was no evidence of foul play, he added, and a search for the snowmachine will continue.
Browning said many outdoor fatalities are avoidable if proper precautions are in place.
"People need to always have a contingency plan, and overnight or emergency equipment in case the weather turns bad or something goes wrong. It's also never a good idea to be alone in the outdoors," he said.

A 42U Dell rack will physically hold at most 6 PowerEdge 4300 servers, drawing a total of 6 * 2.5A = 15A, well within the 26A recommended maximum. However, only 13 PowerEdge 2550 servers can be placed in a 42U Dell rack and still keep the current draw below 26A (26A / 2.0A = 13), although the rack is physically capable of holding 21 PowerEdge 2550 servers.

By: Big 2 News Staff
Updated: March 11, 2013
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was in Afghanistan this weekend.
It's his first trip in his new role as Secretary.
The Vietnam War vet says he traveled to the war-torn nation to thank troops for their service.
He spent time with soldiers in Kabul Sunday ....shaking hands and chatting.
Hagel also says he wants to get a better understanding of the current situation in Afghanistan.
Meantime, a joint press conference with Hagel and Afghan President Hamid Karzai Sunday was canceled.
The cancellation followed comments from Karzai on a deadly Taliban suicide bombing Sunday in Kabul during Hagel's visit.
Karzai says the blast shows the "Taliban are serving the foreigners and are not against the foreigner."
He also says it's a sign the militant group wants "foreigners" to stay.

Judge Denies Republicans' Effort To End Voter Intimidation Consent Decree
December 9, 2009 by Personal Liberty News Desk
Last week, a federal judge in New Jersey rejected an attempt by the Republican National Committee (RNC) to dissolve a 27-year-old court order that is intended to prevent the intimidation of minority voters.
Stemming from a lawsuit brought forth by the Democratic National Committee in 1982, a consent decree was agreed upon which forced the RNC to gain court approval to use certain election tactics, including the creation of voter challenge lists, photographing voters at the polls and posting off-duty police at voting locations in minority neighborhoods, according to The New York Times.
Republicans argued that the consent decree was hampering efforts to combat voter fraud, which had escalated over the previous few years, according to RNC lawyers.
Voting expert Tom Josefiak argued on behalf of the Republicans, stating that the political landscape had changed with African Americans serving as president and attorney general. He also said that the RNC chairman and chief administrative officer are African American, and that the party had no incentive to intimidate minority voters.
In a 79-page ruling, Judge Dickinson Debevoise extended the restrictions for at least another eight years, although he did narrow the scope of the decree.
"It appears that the RNC has been largely unsuccessful in its efforts to attract minority voters," said Debevoise, quoted by the news source. "Until it is able to do so, it will have an incentive to engage in the type of voter suppression that it allegedly committed in the actions that led to the enactment and modification of the consent decree."

Study: Mature Heart Can’t Regenerate Cells
August 8, 2011 by UPI - United Press International, Inc. new muscle to repair damage.
Recent research suggests mammals have the ability to regenerate the heart for a very brief period, about the first week of life, but the ability is quickly lost, a UCLA release said Monday.
The UCLA study suggests it might be possible to turn back the cellular clock to a time when cardiac myocytes had the ability to proliferate and re-grow heart muscle.
Some animals like newts and salamanders can spontaneously regrow damaged organs such as the heart at any point in their life, the researchers say.
During human development, progenitor stem cells create cardiac myocytes that proliferate to form the heart, but once the heart is formed the myocytes transform from immature cells into mature cells that cannot proliferate.
In newts and salamanders cardiac myocytes can go back and forth between immature, or primitive, states to proliferate and repair damage and then revert back into mature cells once the damage is repaired.
“In mammals, we’ve lost that potential,” UCLA study leader Robb MadLellan said. “If we knew how to restore that, or knew the reason why adult myocytes can’t do it, we could try to figure out a way to use nature’s methods to regenerate the heart.”

Oil Spill Made Community More Stressful
October 11, 2011 by UPI - United Press International, Inc. their community exhibited higher self-reported levels of anxiety, worry, nervousness and fear during the oil spill and cleanup.
More than 900 household respondents in Lafourche, Terrebonne and Plaquemines parishes in coastal Louisiana were surveyed from June 16 and July 1, 2010, while the oil was still flowing under the gulf.
The authors suggested that under normal conditions, attachment to community provides avenues for social support and a positive sense of having a place to call home, but under certain conditions, the strong attachments to community increase stress and other negative emotional states.
When the resource base is threatened — for example fisheries being contaminated or closed — high levels of community attachment often anchor people so strongly to their place of residence that they would be unwilling to move to find another place to make a living, the researchers said.
In addition, people who are strongly attached to their communities also tend to know lots of other people in their community so they end up interacting regularly with other people who are also worried, angry and fearful which could create a self-reinforcing cycle of stress and anxiety, Lee and Blanchard said.
The finding was published in the journal American Behavioral Scientist.

Agenda 21 And Executive Orders
August 29, 2012 by Special To Personal Liberty
As of July 26, President Barack Obama has issued 133 executive orders. The definition of the executive order (EO) is: “noun. (often initial capital letters) an order having the force of law issued by the President of the U.S. to the army, navy, or other part of the executive branch of the government.” Some of the 133 EOs relate to, or aim at, the implementation of Agenda 21.
Per Wikipedia:  ‘21’ in Agenda 21 refers to the 21st century. It has been affirmed and modified at subsequent UN conferences.”
President George H.W. Bush signed the agreement in 1992; the total number of signers was 178. In 1995, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 12858 to create the President’s Council on Sustainable Development in order to harmonize U.S. environmental policy with U.N. directives as outlined in Agenda 21.
According to its authors, the objective of sustainable development is to integrate economic, social and environmental policies in order to achieve reduced consumption, social equity and the preservation and restoration of biodiversity. Sustainability advocates insist that every societal decision be based on environmental impact, focusing on three components: global land use, global education, and global population control and reduction. Social equity (social justice) is described as the right and opportunity of all people “to benefit equally from the resources afforded us by society and the environment.”
The objectives are lofty. At the first reading, the titles of the different chapters and subsections are appealing. But there is a Constitutional problem. According to eco-logic,  [41] signing Agenda 21 at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio [de Janeiro].”
JR Nyquist quotes Wikipedia as stating: “Within the executive branch of the U.S. government, President H.W. Bush, President Clinton, and President Obama have all signed executive orders that broadly support the tenets of Agenda 21 but do not make reference to Agenda 21 by name.”
Some of the objectives of the Agenda 21 are against American traditions and even laws. Redistribution of wealth, if it is forced from above, violates the principle of protection of private property. Another tenet is the need to substantially reduce the world population; one overzealous estimate mentions by 85 percent. Those two requirements aim at “enhancing” the sustainability and equitable sharing the global wealth among all nations.
The obvious questions are:
- Who will decide what is an equitable share for a resident in the United States versus one in Bangladesh or Sweden?
- Who is going to decide how many people each country must abort or exterminate to reach their allotment of the world population quota?
- How will progress toward these goals be assured?
The experiences of my childhood and youth spent in Nazi and Communist dictatorships have taught me that Agenda 21 is not achievable, short of a harsh dictatorship. For example, even repeating the Holocaust by killing another 6 million people would reduce the present global population by less than 0.1 percent. Redistribution of wealth is equal to make all equally poor.
The paths leading to Agenda 21 are the economy, the environment and education. The pursuit of each has produced some recent detrimental results, like turning down the Keystone pipeline project, refusing to implement the economic recommendations of the bipartisan “supercommittee” and the continuous dumbing down of the educational requirements.
The objectives of Agenda 21 appear to first promote local (national) dictatorships, culminating in a global dictatorship.
In human history many rulers have tried the latter, from the Chinese emperors and the pharaohs to the various 20th century dictators. Not one was able to establish a lasting legacy. Agenda 21, just like the Communist nirvana, is totally incompatible with human nature.

Name:
Picasso
Age:
Four years old
Gender:
Female
Kind:
Quaker Parrot
Missouri, USA
A
friend of mine owned a Quaker named Buddy and he just talked up a storm. When I met Buddy I knew it was all over I had to have one of these beautiful creatures. I already owned two budgies and one cockatiel. I got Picasso almost five years ago. Her hatchday is April 9th. My parents and I went to a bird fair. And I saw a lady there who was selling these awesome birds. And I asked my dad if I could get one. He allowed it. Then the lady picked up this little green devil, and told me to pick her up. I promptly got bitten. I shook my hand a little hard and the bird fluttered to the floor. I went to pick her up and got bitten again. So my dad picked up the bird and she bit through his calluses. This was the bird I wanted and so we took her home. I named her Picasso after Pablo Picasso and also because she dunked her colored pellets in her water. Since her water looked like paint. It took me a month to tame down the little she devil. But when I did, I was rewarded with a bird beyond my wildest dreams! She's fierce loyal, quite hilarious, and amazingly sweet. She says: Pretty girl, Hi Paulie, Hello, Kiss Kiss. Laughs like a human. Makes numerous cockatiel and budgies because she listens to her roommates too much. She's been working on some new words. We are trying to learn Momma's Girl. Picasso has four other bird brothers and sisters. Peaches and Pedro (the budgies) and Paulie and Hedwig (the cockatiels). One doggie sister, Baby. And one fishie brother my male betta Fishie.

I’ve recently had a couple of my clients with this problem. So I did some digging. I was shocked by the answer. This is a serious problem. The condition is known as coprophagia. The good news is you can fix it with a little dog training and a few small changes to their environment. I wont mention the brands of dog food that were being used to be fair. Some dogs work better with certain brands than others. However I do discourage my clients from using certain poor quality brands.
- ‘food’ again. This is not just a vulgar habit; it is a cry for health. The dog needs a better diet that will enable him to absorb the nutrients his body needs.
- When dogs consume feces from other animals, they may be seeking minerals lacking in their regular dog food.
* Change the dog’s diet. Buy or prepare only nutritious, quality food that is formulated for the dog’s age, breed and any medical issues. Two brands that I highly recommend are Blue Buffalo and Nutro Ultra Holistic. They can be found at your local Petsmart. I’ve had good luck with those brands. Their first ingredient are always a lean meat. To me; it’s the perfect mix of premium proteins, antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, whole grains and healthy oils to help your dog be at his best. By the way your dogs poops will be amazing.
* ‘leave it’ and to physically keep the dog from trying to sniff and eat stools. Always praise your dog for listening. You can also reinforce the verbal praise with tidbits carried in a pouch.

Richard Vonnegut, vice chairman of the council, says U.S. Bike Route 35 would run from the Michigan border through LaPorte County down through Indianapolis to Louisville, Ky. The United States Bicycle Route System proposes to establish a series of officially designated, cross-country bikeways using existing roads for long-distance cyclists to follow while traveling across America. The Miami County commissioners this week signed a resolution expressing their support for the route, which would follow the Nickel Plate Trail through Peru. The resolution signed Monday also petitions the Indiana Department of Transportation to actively cooperate with the Hoosier Rails to Trails Council to designate the bike corridor..

MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (CBS) – A bank robbery suspect that eluded police and drove on the wrong side of the road slammed into two cars in Bucks County Friday, seriously injuring at least one person.
The incident began shortly after 11 a.m. on Friday, when police received a call that an armed suspect had robbed the First Federal of Bucks County bank on Highland Park Way in Levittown. Police say he parked across the street at a shopping center, left on foot, then got into his vehicle.
“At some point, the driver took off at a high rate of speed onto Oxford Valley Road heading north, and he turned onto South Bucks Town Road…we had reports of him fishtailing. At some point on South Bucks Town Road, he crossed into a grassy medium…and probably lost control and went into oncoming traffic,” explains Lt. John Michniewicz, of the Middletown Township Police Department.
Police were immediately on the scene and found the alleged bank robber crawling out of his vehicle. He did have a firearm in his possession, and cash, presumably from the bank, was recovered at the scene. At this time, the bank is calculating how much the suspect stole.
“It was a pretty horrific scene. It appeared to me to be a head on collision between his car and the other vehicles,” Lt. Michniewicz says.
John Kerrigan (Credit:)
Kerrigan’s office is right near the crash scene. His administrative assistant, Nichola Laich, said he just left work.
“It was only five to ten minutes since he had left when we got the message that he had been involved in a serious motor vehicle accident,” said Laich. “Very difficult to hear.”
Kerrigan has been practicing law for forty years. He’s a well known criminal defense attorney. Kerrigan has a wife, two children, and a grandson. Laich did visit him in the hospital since the accident Friday afternoon.
“He was in good spirits and was quiet aware of everything that was going,” said Laich.
She tells Eyewitness News they were still assessing his injuries. Saint Mary’s Hospital reports him in serious condition.
The other driver is also said to be in the hospital.
Police say the bank robber was likewise taken to St. Mary, where he is undergoing surgery. Officers did not release word on his condition and said they are working to confirm his identity and determine whether or not he had prior convictions.
“There’s an officer at the hospital now standing by, waiting to get the updated information on him. At this point, it depends on whether he is medically released or admitted to the hospital. If he’s medically released, he’ll be taken into custody,” Lt. Michniewicz says.
If the suspect remains in the hospital, officers say they will get a warrant for his arrest and will wait until he’s released to make an arrest.

For La Russa, it's all about this season
Manager begins 31st campaign as skipper, 14th with Cards
LAS VEGAS -- With only one year left on his contract, the questions have already begun for Cardinals manager Tony La Russa. And he answered them patiently and with equanimity on Wednesday at baseball's annual Winter Meetings.
Just don't call him a lame duck.
"[Like a] spry chicken is how I feel," La Russa laughed.
Still, he understands the speculation. Entering his 14th season at the helm of the Cardinals and his 31st as a Major League manager, La Russa has a grasp of reality. But he's not ready to hang it up just yet. His contract situation is a minor consideration at most -- as it has long been for him in St. Louis.
"I feel so much the same," he said. "I've said it, but I really mean it. I don't feel any different right now in almost every respect than I did at the first of two years [of this contract] or the first of three years or the second of three. You know what I mean?
"It's all [about] even think about it beyond that."
La Russa and the club have for some time had an understanding that if he wants to return, he's welcome, and when he decides he's had enough, he can leave. A new contract is reached every two or three years, but it has rarely dictated his status from season to season.
He said Wednesday that he's doing well with the new Cardinals front office, a year after Walt Jocketty's removal as general manager. The regime will not be a factor, he said, in when he decides to hang it up.
"We already went through one year," he said. "Mo [general manager John Mozeliak] was part of Walt's immediate staff, so we've worked well all year long. I'm not going to get to the end of the year and think, 'Well, I don't want to be a part of this organization.' I think it's going to be more, 'When is it time to stop managing?' But I don't even think about it because I'm ready for 2009."
So he's begun looking at the team he's going to manage in the coming season, and he likes most of what he sees. Like the front office, he'd love to add a ninth-inning reliever, and he wouldn't mind some starting-pitching depth -- or his long-time object of desire, a big-name cleanup hitter.
But the team as constituted has La Russa getting excited.
"It's better than last year's club because you have a whole year of at-bats for [Rick] Ankiel, [Ryan] Ludwick and [Skip] Schumaker. You also have [Kyle] Lohse that we know is with us. I think [Joel] Pineiro will be improved this year. You got [Todd] Wellemeyer with a year of experience and health. I think Khalil [Greene] is a good fit for our club.
"So on paper we're better, and if we can just make a move or two, it will be significant."
One area that hasn't changed for the Cards is second base, where it appears Adam Kennedy will return for a third season and will go to Spring Training as the favorite for the starting job.
"All I know is that the difference between Adam last year and his first year was significant," La Russa said. "His first year, for whatever reason, you know, he wasn't the same player he's been. And then he might have gotten upset, but, I mean, really, I probably played him more than I should have, showing patience because of what he had done in his career. Last year he was more himself, so then it comes down to, is he going to work as hard and be as ready this spring, which I think he will."
As for Kennedy's trade request late in 2008, La Russa indicated it would not be an issue.
"We talked about it at the end of the season," the manager said. "He just wants to play, and I think it was a mutual respect thing. I thought he handled himself really well the times he didn't play. He ended up on a plus note. I think he's been quoted as saying, or maybe he said it over the radio or something, that he just wants to play, and if he has a chance to play in St. Louis, he has no problem playing here."

Cabrini College junior attacker Casey Grugan says Nick Colleluori continues to be an inspiration to those who played with him at Ridley High.
“I remember how long he fought and how hard he fought,” said Grugan, a United States
Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association third-team Division III All-American last year. “It was unbelievable how hard he worked.
“It’s a shame that something that bad can happen to such a good person. It makes you want to fight that mu ch ha rder.”
On Saturday, Grugan and the Cavaliers will get the chance to honor the memory of a man whose fight against non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma has led to a foundation and lacrosse tournament that has captured the imagination of the entire lacrosse world.
From 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday at the Ridley High Athletic Complex in Folsom, Pa., 13 Division I and III teams will play in the 2nd Annual Nick Colleluori Classic. Over 7,000 people are expected to attend a special Fall Ball tournament that has already helped the HEADstrong Foundation raise over $200,000 for blood cancer research. Admission is $10.
Nick was a standout lacrosse player at Ridley who was diagnosed with lymphoma as a freshman playing at Hofstra three years ago. Nicknamed “Head,” Colleluori himself created the idea of the HEADstrong Foundation as part of his dream to raise awareness and, ultimately, to cure blood cancer.
His fight to live may have ended after 14 months when he died on Nov. 28, 2006, but his cause has grown at a rate perhaps even he would not have predicted.
Nick’s mother, Cheryl Colleluori, the Foundation President, said the goal is to raise $250,000 at this year’s Classic. She noted that the tournament will be manned by 150 volunteers.
“It’s just an honor to play for his name and go back to Ridley High,” said Cabrini senior midfielder Pat Grenier, also a Ridley grad. “He (Nick) was the captain my junior year and he treated every practice like it was a state championship game.”
Grugan, the Pennsylvania Athletic Conference Player of the Year last season, said Colleluori intensity set him above the rest.
“He had so much leadership,” Grugan said. “He was such an inspiring person, everything he did he gave 110 percent.”
Cabrini coach Steve Colfer agreed with his players, saying the Colleluori Classic is much more than just another Fall Ball Tournament.
“It truly is one of the greatest honors that has been bestowed on our program in my 9 years as head coach,” he said. “We take our participation and affiliation with Headstrong very seriously. The guys look forward to everything to do with the tournament. We are trying to cover our campus in lime green t-shirts”
Aside from Grugan and Grenier, there are five other Ridley grads on the Cabrini roster: senior midfielder Chris Cavaliere, sophomore midfielder Dan Terenick and freshmen John McSorly (defense), Steve Gregg (long-stick midfielder) and Brian Hill (attacker). Cabrini, located 15 miles north of Ridley in the Philadelphia suburbs, features 31 of its 48 players from the Philadelphia area.
“Our players from Ridley HS know Nick’s story very well,” said Colfer, whose Cavaliers have won the past eight PAC championships and advanced to the NCAA quarterfinals last year. “And I ask them to share their stories and memories with their current teammates to educate them about Nick’s courageous battle and so that each of us when faced with adversity can draw on Nick’s courage.
“It motivates all of us to do the very best we can each day in lacrosse and life.”.

Mural Once Hidden Is Seen
Albeit for only a few weeks, a mural that was once hidden inside on the second floor of this building became visible to the public as the owner began tearing the building. Suddenly revealed to the public, the mural created a positive buzz around the community and for the passersby. It also received some attention on a local Philly blog, Naked Philly. This gave us an idea to do more murals inside vacant buildings, in hopes of creating a resurgence of activity in underutilized spaces. Perhaps we could even plan to do these murals spontaneously in places where we know buildings are coming down sometime soon... Feel free to share your thoughts!

More samples added
We are pleased to say that we have added more music samples and will be adding many more in the coming days.
You will now find samples of every track on Conspiracy Theories.
Sonic Curiosity June 2007
The band is: Phil Miller (from Matching Mole, Hatfield & the North, and National Health) on guitar and synth guitar, Pete Lemer on keyboards, Fred Baker on bass, Mark Fletcher on drums, Simon Picard on saxophone, Simon Finch on trumpet and flugelhorn, Annie Whitehead on trombone, Didier Malherbe (from Gong) on saxophone, flute, doudouk and ocarina, Doug Boyle on guitar, Dave Stewart (from Egg, Hatfield & the North, and National Health) on tuned percussion, Barbara Gaskin on vocals, and Richard Sinclair (from Caravan) on bass.
With a line-up of seasoned pros like the above, one must expect the music is going to be excruciatingly tight and slippery slick. It is.
The horns waft and sway with amiable emotion. Maintaining a very jazzy disposition, the horn section delivers tasty riffs with delightful expertise. Comfortable melodies are imbued with molten passion. The saxophones wail with cheerful melancholy. The trumpet warbles with earnest fervor.
Enchanting riffs spill from the guitar with glorious agility. Each note is meticulously placed to elevate the entire instrumental gestalt. And when the guitar gets the chance to elbow its way into the spotlight, the glory becomes ecstatic and amazing.
The keyboards provide delicate embellishment to the melodies with often dramatic sweeps. Nimble-fingered chords slide into wondrous melodies that serve to connect the other instruments’ riffs.
The percussion is skillful and knows exactly how to drive from a submerged vantage. Never too strong, never too elusive, the rhythms fit perfectly between the rest of the notes.
The basslines are intricate, fluid, and lend particular nectar to the tunes.
These compositions are dazzling and engaging. Their ability to immediately put the listener at ease is eminent. While steeped in Canterbury roots, this music is very straight-ahead jazz, merging old school traditions with modern delivery. The result is mesmerizing and rewarding, with wide appeal..
Let it Rock – June 2007
Whatever you might make of the Canterbury scene these days, it’s not the same anymore, there’s not much progressiveness in it now, which is not to say it’s worse than it was before – but Phil Miller‘s band were latecomers anyway. With a new album to mark the group’s 25th year in the business, they bring on the top-notch fusion, the title track wrapping round the listener’s ears like a cosy‘s piano sings so poignant. It’s clearly the effortless endeavour.

Thanks Micheal.
One of the things that's dawned on me while using BitTorrent is the importance of feedback to the community. I probably wouldn't use BitTorrent if there was no share ratio, if they just said, “Just do whatever you think is OK.”, which is what most community projects do. I think BitTorrent would not be what it is today if there was no feedback or share ratio. Granted, it's not what it could be, but it is working.
I could contribute $10 bucks or $1000, and what difference would it make? It's a shot in the dark either way because I have no idea what the numbers are. The project could be rolling in cash. I think defining the problem is job one. Once you define it, you empower the community to get involved and do more, which could be contributions or just keeping you in mind and promoting the website. I couldn't be more excited about Bit Torrent, and it's really all about the feedback, seeing my humble part defined in some real way makes me feel like part of the community. I think the more you define the problem, the more you empower people to get involved. Asking the community to get involved but giving them no real way to define the problem could be compared to a form of torture, putting a bag over someone's head and demanding they do something. Does that promote community involvement? Seems like sometimes, that's the point, the community is expected to do nothing so a minority population can justify a spirit of entitlement or exploitation.
Third party verification of the protion that can be verified would probalby also be helfuf.
The idea is not global change, but simply growth, positive change. That's where global change starts.

WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I mean yes flash is a technology still used mainly in pornography websites and websites designed by idiots but it goes away. Mozilla (and google/youtube + porn sites) should start pushing open web formats aggressively (ie not use webm as a fallback and disable it for monetized videos on youtube). Also we should get rid of h264 and shit like that from the web.

Jesus Christ!
One question please........ aside from cost of this statue - why do atheists feel it necessary to mock and make nasty comments concerning Christians. Truly, I have never heard a Christian call you down, make fun of your non-belief or doubts. We might silently pray for you, but wonder why you have to be downright nasty and ugly. Have you ever heard of Respect? Live and let live? I bet all you atheists have family members, friends, co-workers connected to a religion and worship in churches, temples, synagogues....do you express your feelings to them in person? Laugh at their 'stupidity', call them 'ignorant'? No! Why? because you need your family, you need your friends, and as for co-workers - your boss would probably fire you if you acted that way on the job. So it comes down to most of you being hypocrits - you can only vent your feelings annonymously in letters or postings. So put on your big boy or big girl panties - if you can't say it in person, don't put it in writing. Have a great day!
Nice Ellie! Well spoken....
Jesus loves all people weather you love Him or not/ no matter what you have done, He wants to wash you and make you clean, wouldnt that be nice...But, He wont strive with us forever which means... there is "a cut off time" that no one knows...Get with the program people, blow off the dust from your bible and BE like Jesus. Dont look at the stupid mistakes people make as an excuse not to believe, it wont work on Judgement Day :) If you dont have a bible, just ask one of us "Jesus freaks" and they will give you one, free.
I don't have any problem with them erecting a statue of Jesus Christ. If I have any problem at all with anything and I suppose I'm the only one that does, it is this: Why is Jesus Christ wearing a gold crown? Only crown I recall him ever wearing was made of thorns.
@Ellie
Oh please. You haven't lived the shoes of an atheist. We get discriminated against ALL THE TIME! We are the last minority where it is considered okay to discriminate against. Yes, I have family and friends that are theists and I try to express my views to them all the time, but I get the cold shoulder because apparently Christians are afraid to talk about their beliefs to non-Christians. And if my boss fired me because I was not Christian, then you bet your @ss that I would sue.
The fact that atheists have to vent their feelings anonymously only goes to show how intolerant Christians are.
Christianity is a sick and immoral cult. This statue is a huge waste of money and resources that could have gone to feeding a starving child but instead you Christians have to go and flaunt your messiah.
I'm not an athiest, I'm agnostic. But I've been treated like dirt by Christians many many times.
One holiday, I was chastised by the people with whom I work for taking down the Christmas decorations before the Epiphany. Though the supervisors asked me to do it, I was treated like the anti-christ for not giving a damn about Christmas in mid-January. And the horror when they realized I didn't decorate my home for Easter.
I don't have a problem with Christians. I even voted -- several times -- to keep a local cross on a hill, though it's federal land. You have faith, great. I have tried. I don't believe in blind adherance to any ideology and I like to think for myself. So let's just agree to disagree.
Dear Lola3,
I do truly hope you are not gambling with your eternity on the stupidity of "people". The kindest person in the world will let you down dear. Get past the people thing, get your eyes OFF people and put them on The Lord Jesus. You Wont be let down or disappointed is what His words and actions say. And you said blind adherence, there is "nothing" blind about Him or faith. You said you tried, why did you give up? Dont worry about what people say, read you bible first and dont worry about church goers, you dont need to worry about them or impress them. Just DO what your bible tells you to and you cant go wrong. It sounds like you were hurt by someone or just gave in to your desires (sin) but God did not give up on you :) Get back on the horse, thats what life is all about. This time, REALLY study the word and dont push yourself too much. Enjoy it/ get away from those who would discourage you. Find a "good" bible "teacher" not just a preacher and you will be AMAZED at how fun it is and how captivating it is. God knows we are just made of dirt, He can deal with our faults through His perfect Son Jesus. Just dont give up :) ever!! No matter what! Thats what will get Gods attention. We know that from the bible. May He bless you and heal you sister.
No thank you. I have made my choice and I'm happy with my lack of faith in any god. You have fun though.
@ThunderProof:
"Why is Jesus Christ wearing a gold crown? Only crown I recall him ever wearing was made of thorns."
Here in Poland Jesus has been crowned and named "king of Poland".
So its some kind of symbol what people belive in. Jesus isn't sooo tall in Bible too ;)
Read your bible just a bit more my friend, you will know why. Its all good :) Think future.....Hummm The New Jerusalem....Hummmm
Thanks for the info too. I love His new name :)
What a stupid waste of money - a shrine to an imaginary god.
Prove He is imaginary :)
You would have to claim to have all knowledge of everything there is to know about everything to say "Im an atheist". You are saying that in all the things you dont know, God does not exist. The top scientist say that visible matter is only about 10% of "reality" as we know it. Talk about faith and religion, now thats a fairytale religion. No factual basis for that kind of belief. You cant claim ignorance, you have been warned by the watchman on the tower. Jesus is coming back and we will all stand before Him and have to give an account. You cant earn the right to be in Gods family. His son paid the price with His life and all you have to do is accept the redemption He offers, free of charge. We will NEVER be "good enough", just say thank you and serve your KING.
The burden of proof is on you to prove that your definition of god exists, not on the atheist. Atheism is simply the lack of belief in a theistic deity. Atheism is the rational position to take in light of insufficient evidence for a theistic deity.
Prove he exists ?
Can you give us a date when he is likely to show up ?
Ellie 123...
I think you need to read a lot more (try the non fiction area of the library) Atheist are the least liked people in the US: Lack of non belief and younger critical thinkers are the biggest threat to religion.
In the old days we were just slaughtered, last days we were educated to make us respect people that pray to fresh air. These days we tell it like it is a bunch of BS. You would be surprised how much your beleifs in a invisible god tries to dictate society.
You were saying?
As surprised to see how many self-proclaimed 'athiests' look towards their denied deity when the ground starts to shake?
@ kubush84
Still, you have to claim to have all knowledge of everything to say Im an atheist. You have "no proof". I know for a fact, If you read your bible and took the time to "Seriously investigate" its authenticity, you would come to only ONE conclusion. Maybe you are just lazy, there is nothing to be afraid of. There is no burden on "me". I cant give you answers for something you dont understand....
I want to join a nuclear physics class but before I sign up, I want all the answers, PFFT! Come on!
Analysis = You would not understand the answers even if you were given the answers.
DIY + pray to your maker and ask Him to make Himself known to you with an honest heart and you wont be denied. Its His promise to you as stated in "His word". :)
@HIS child-2382068
Nonsense. I am an atheist because I do not accept the theistic claim of a deity. Atheism is the lack of belief, it is not a belief in it of itself. Would you have to have 100% knowledge of everything in order for you to say "Santa clause does not exist"? No, of course not. The burden of proof is on the person making the claim that X exists.
"I know for a fact, If you read your bible and took the time to..."
Apparently you don't realize how ignorant it is to claim knowledge without any evidence whatsoever. I have read and studied the bible, as have many ex-christians atheists and have come to the only logical and rational conclusion that your bible is wrong and that your god does not exist. I am saying this as a positive claim because if the existence of your god being real is defined and contingent upon the bible being 100% correct, then I can show you why it is not.
Get off your high horse and don't talk down to me simply because I don't buy your bronze age superstitious myth. Pretending that you can't answer serious critical questions about your religion because I won't understand them, is just an excuse because you know in your heart that you can't defend the nonsense that you accept.
"pray to your maker and ask Him to make Himself known to you with an honest heart and you wont be denied. Its His promise to you as stated in "His word". :)"
I have and so have many other atheists but nothing happened. So apparently his "word" was wrong. :)
Jesus Christ, that's a big statue.
Hell yes, biggest graven image I ever did see!
What a waste of resources. Who wants to see a 167 foot statue of anyone? Looks like it belongs in Jesus Disneyland. Just more crap cluttering up the landscape.
[sarcasm] Go see the new 24 million Kc clock on the town square of Brno, Czech Republic instead. It doesn't show the time (seriously), but it does dispense a glass ball at 11:00 every day. (What will those former Communists think of next?)
Build the biggest statue of your god, and he'll shower you with rewards!
Just look at how well that worked out for the ancient Greeks...and Romans...and Egyptians, Phoenicians, etc etc
All of which were pagans, and non-believers. not much of a point now, is it.
If you define "pagan" as "any religion that is not Christian" then what is the point of pointing that out? They most definitely were believers of their gods. His point still stands.
PS - So, this community in Poland has NO starving people, NO need for government assisted medical programs, NO alcoholics, NO prostitutes, NO children in need of a state-funded education ... because if they DID, they SURELY wouldn't waste the resources to build a 167 foot tall statue of jebus.... right?
wow, what a waste of money, this show the stupidity of people and they damed religions, shame.
And the point is?
The One and only King! All the scoffing wont make it not so, give up now or later, He loves you no matter what you have done or said....but be caaaareful time is running out :) Sure, He doesnt like idols but He judges the hearts intention......What do you use your money for??? DOH!! Serve your King!
I use money to feed my family.
I do not have any "soul" and your Jesus was a charlatan preacher who died two thousand years ago after making money by "curing" diseases by speaking Hebrew to "spirits". And believe me, each of his patients would have prefered Mayo Clinic to "talking to spirits" if they had the opportunity.
They used their money to get You to "think" about Jesus. Food goes away, your soul Does Not...Ever, in a place where time does not exist.
@Alex-1488986 Your opinion pretty much matches the one I used to hold, though I did tend to blame much of the mythologizing on people who came well after Jesus' lifetime. However, after having not giving it much thought since around my early thirties (I'm currently 54) I ran into an article that caused me to doubt whether Jesus actually existed at all. Anywhosits, long story short, the piece piqued my interest enough to pursue the topic and so I read a good deal more, both pro and con, on the subject. Now, as a result of that reading, I am quite convinced that the person of Jesus is an utter fiction. (Bad news for those Christians who enjoy disparaging Muslims: The "Prophet" Muhammad was, in contrast to Jesus, a person in easily ascertainable history. (Though of course he was, and is, no more "divine' or a "prophet" than my pet goldfish.))
Most children stop believing in fairy tales by age 10 -- these people apparently didn't get the memo.
Well, then why have so many Expert big bangers, atheist and evolutionary "scientists" bent on debunking "The word" become believers? In their thorough investigation using Science, archeology, ancient documents back up 100% what "The Word" says. Believing Nothing came to be from Nothing without a designer ( God ) is believing in a fairy tale. Have you ever hear of the flagella motor? Look it up. Speaking about something you obviously know Nothing about is what my mommy taught me was called ignorant. Willingly ignorant must be a tough realm to live in. Hope you get a clue soon. He is waiting for you to give up fighting Him, He created you to love you.
What utter nonsense! The Big Bang Theory and Evolution are scientific models of reality and are not dependent on atheism or vice-a-versa. The fact that you reject evidence based science just goes to show how dangerous religion really is. It promotes ignorants. Your assumption that most scientists that try to debunk Christianity become Christians is utterly false. You make up facts for your own comfort. Atheism says nothing about origins. It is a lack of belief. But let me tell you that the current scientific thought of the universe is that it was eternal, at least in some form. I guess that means that your god is out of a job. The flagella motor? Is that a reference to intelligent design? The flagella is a perfect example of evolution in action. Try again.
@ kubush 84
Evolution is the biggest religion there is...something from nothing! PFFT! Where did the matter come from to make "anything". Something from nothing and thats not to even mention "design". The probability factor of JUST the eye to "evolve" is IMPOSSIBLE, do the math. GET a clue, things dont "evolve better" , they deteriorate. Dont you know anything about your religion? Dont you know the FIRST law of thermodynamics? God is calling you out of your professed ignorance. You will be pleasantly surprised when you give up and give your life to your maker. He made you to live with Him, He knows you are just made of dirt. Give Him a break and stop rebelling child. You have just made so many childish statements, not to offend you, sorry.
As a scientist - and an atheist - I am curious about the rationalization behind accepting a 'GOD' as an explanation for the existence of the universe. Whence the 'GOD'? Why does the 'existence' of 'God' not require a source? Why is the eternal nature of 'God' without explanation acceptable? The wonders of the universe are many, which is why science is fun. The fact that we do not yet have a complete understanding is not a reason to suggest that it is time to give up and evoke 'god'. To suggest that your - or my - incomplete knowledge means that such knowledge is unattainable is the ultimate hubris.
@ nedhead,
Finally, a "half" decent response here. Well, I see you profess to be a scientist. May I suggest to you to find the Top scientist to study with. The Top leading scientist are Christians now a days, not to insult your intelligence. You are obviously pondering the wonders of the universe, good, most people do. If God gave you all the answers for those kinds of things, you would then be God wouldnt you...? You trusted your mommy and daddy when they said its safe to do this and that, didnt you? Well, why would God (Jesus) ask you to believe in a Lie or give you a red herring, He wouldnt. I would not start with the big questions until you learned the smaller ones first since you love science. We dont just walk into the top classes of science, do we? Start at the bottom, ask the right questions and dont write God out of your equation yet since you obviously cant deny He does not exists, right? Aaaaand No one has what you so called "evoked" anything on you. You are a scientist right, only facts please...no stretching the truth with Evoke, come on, God (and I ) expects a little bit more from a smart scientist person....not like some of these ranters and ravers here above and below. Just out of curiosity, If everything "we" make here on earth has a designer, why would anyone think there is NO design involved in our beautiful expanses in space, earth, all its life and US? No designer Hu? Just accident? You should know as a scientist, thats a mathematical impossibility...even if some funny people do "believe" our solar system and everything in it is billions and billions of years old. Kinda like they say, the grand canyon took millions of years to create. We now know that this happened very quickly, like a couple of days probably. Wouldnt all that sediment be in the gulf of Mexico...DOH!
Anyway, hope that give you something to think about and dont forget, No "one" is evoking anything on you, Jesus is inviting you to be with Him....although He asks for your whole heart and thats it.
While I appreciate the depth of your irrational conviction, in concert with the shallowness of your arguments, I fail to perceive even a hint of an attempt to answer my civil question. Perhaps if you were to try and craft a paragraph or two that did not include bumper sticker slogans, factual errors, and insults, a constructive dialog might ensue.
My Nedhead friend,
I thought I made myself clear, sorry bout that. I will say it like I did to that above person.
Hi, I want to sign up for nuclear physics class but before I sign up, I want all the answers. Thats not very smart hu? I know you know the answer to that.....How can you understand the answer to something you dont understand?
Like I was saying, you presume to be smarter than me which is your first mistake because I dont use fancy words to entertain ears. Dont ever do that if you really want to proceed in science and the pursuit of truth can be blinded by your presuppositions. Ive learned some of the most remarkable things from some very "dumb" folks. No insult intended. Sometimes we get into what I call the "fishbowl" effect. Get out of the fishbowl and go live in the rest of the world and learn of it, you cant learn of it in a classroom or lab only.
Is that too bumper stickerish for you sir? Im usually the one who says I dont like bumper sticker phrases I never meant to be insulting, this is the problem with not being face to face in conversation. Miscommunication is rampant because we dont see facial expressions nor do we hear tone of voice....sorry if I seemed insulting.
God has revealed Himself to the poor, sick and stupid and thumbed his nose and the "know it alls". All knowledge must exalt God who "gave" it to us.
OK, I didn't want to get to this point but here we go.
First off, as I approach retirement age (although I have no plans to retire), I have had a very successful career in science (and business).
The very essence of science is seeking to understand the answers (and new questions) to that which we don't know already.
And finally, you still have not attempted to answer the very clear and simple question which I posed earlier; most likely because you have no answer.
You speak (write) words that resemble sentences, but they have no content, no substance (not to mention no comprehension of grammar or spelling).
I end this thread with you now, because I get no satisfaction from engaging in a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent.
@ nedhead,
Oh my friend, I expected much more from you than giving your resume and insulting me...since you are so smart. The Lord expects a lot more from you also since He gave you this intelligence. He will require an account form you. What did you do with what I gave you...rebel against Me?
Here, I will try to say it again differently and this will be the last from me.
You are an expert in Chinese characters. (your resume)
You go up to the Egyptian hieroglyphics teacher and try to joust with him on his understanding of what he knows. You say, ok, I dont want to join your class, also you must give me all the answers to the questions I have for you in your field of expertise.
This is what you are doing. I expected much more from you as a seasoned scientist and educated person.
Seek Him, pray to Him, call out to Him and you wont be disappointed. This life is so full of disappointments. He wont disappoint you, You have everything to gain and Nothing that matters to lose......
@HIS child-2382068
Don't presume that you can educate people, especially on the subject of science when you proclaim such utter ignorance by asking, "how did something come from nothing?" when it comes to evolution. Any first year biology student can tell you why this is such a silly question but I'll let you try to figure that out on your own. You fail to see that something that looks designed isn't necessarily so.
You seem to be throwing out all the most common Creationist canards like candy to kids. ALL have been easily debunked by logic and evidence. The earth is not thousands of years old. It is around 4.55 billion years old. The Grand Canyon was carved out over millions of years and that is backed by real evidence and not just a collection of 2000 year old writings from some ignorant old superstitious men.
You need to go get yourself a real education outside of your bible and creationist videos on youtube.
It's not the statue, it's the Man.
And if you dont believe in the Man, it's His ideas.
And if you dont believe in His ideas then there are one of two possibilities...
1. you have never read them
or
2. you are too stupid to understand them
there is a third possibility...
3. you are to selfish to accept them.
Jesus is not a fairy tale, or an imaginary figure. What is a fairy tale is the belief that you can continue in your self absorbed lives and find any peace and happiness. At least the Poles have a clue.
Well worded Hal, its kinda like what I said....
Oh? The man that invented an eternal torture chamber should be revered? The guy who taught how to properly beat your slave? Sorry, I don't accept your supposed messiah and his message. Your cult is dangerous and a waste of resources.
@kubush84
Dont even get started on trying to go into MY area (the bible) please. You are embarrassing yourself already. Your questioning God, for one....Two, you just made a statement about slaves and morphed into something that has nothing to do with fact. See what your Darwin god evolved you into...A fairytale artist just writing make believe :) Your god Darwin even admitted it in his later writings that his theory was not possible but it was better that believing in God. Why dont you go look up and find that paper....I did :) Did you know he called the human cell, just plasma like glue that holds us together that has no real function....PFT! Primordial ooze, fairytale :) No facts to back up your hocus-pocus. You know you are wrong thats why you TRY and attack the bible to your own demise. You are the dangerous cult imposing your laws on us and silence us. Stick to facts.
Your heart will be hardened if you keep this up, and you wont be able to know Him. I suggest you stop while you still have the chance. These are not my opinions, these are biblical facts well documented by eye witness accounts....I hope you believe in eye witness accounts, our judicial system does. Who is the cult follower? God will happily forgive you of anything you have done and will heal you of the wrongs done TO you that made you this Hard-hearted. Ask Jesus to make Himself known to you and ask him to forgive you and tell him you want to give up and surrender your whole life to Him :) He loves YOU :)
First off, yes, I have a brain, hence I can question ANYTHING, even your made-up god. Second, I did not morph anything. I took it right out of your bible. You couldn't even defend it and rightfully so because it is indefensible. I can bet that I know more about your religion and your bible than you do.
"Your god Darwin even admitted it in his later writings that his theory was not possible but it was better that believing in God."
Doesn't your god say "Thou shalt not bear false witness"? Because that is exactly what you did here. Darwin NEVER said anything of the sort. Finding made up quotes from Creationist websites is not considered real research. Darwin knew that we had heritable traits but did not know about genetics. Darwin set the foundation of Evolutionary Theory but we have learned a lot since and it is a lot more accurate and refined than it was 150 years ago. It is called the progress of science.
How the hell am I imposing my laws and silencing you?!?!?!?!?
"No facts to back up your hocus-pocus."
LOL. Oh the irony, it hurts! Let's see what you have to believe in be a YEC: a magical father figure in the sky created everything from nothing and then magically transformed dirt into the first man, and then transformed a rib into a woman (because she was created to serve Adam, of course), then a talking snake convinced the woman to eat from a magical tree which then caused all of their descendent's to be cursed (by hocus-pocus) and the only way to be saved from an eternal torture chamber is to believe and love some guy that lived in the middle east 2k years ago that walked on water, magically made water into wine, and raised from the dead. ROTFL!!! And you call incremental changes in species over a vast amount of time to be "hocus-pocus"?!?
Eye-witness accounts are not sufficient even in the courtroom. The credibility of the eye witness must be established. Also, the fact that the eye witness needs to have their story in line with all the other evidence, otherwise the testimony is called into question. The bible's accounts are hear-say to say the least. And if you truly believe in eye-witness testimony then why don't you accept the testimony of the Prophet Mohammed?

The subject of Jesus has never and will NEVER "go away". Why are you all so offended by Jesus? Why is everyone talking about Jesus? Why does the core of every subject now a days come down to Jesus? He has put it in our hearts, thats why...says the bible. Check it out, dont believe me :)
"Why is everyone talking about Jesus?"
Maybe, just maybe it's because the article is about a giant jesus statue?
[sarcasm] Would you like to see another fine example of your European Union taxes [straight from your pocket] hard at work? Follow this link to see a statue of Jan Perner, the founder of Czech railroads, newly installed in Ceska Trebova:
(If Perner looked anything like his statue, he was probably used for the first rails . . . )
I think its totally awesome - Im not bothered either way that its supposed to be Jesus though. I would love to see the one in Rio.
Now if they built two of them either side of a river like they did in the lord of the rings I would definitely go see them, that would be awesome!
What an ugly monstrosity
That sends a clear message
Polish people believe in myths from the dusty old book called the bible
They think it will put them on the map !!

You seem like a nice, logical person who can tell the future like the bible can...I think I will believe in what you believe now ......NOT! :)
"Again ! You CANT be an atheist. No such thing, sorry"
*facepalm* What a stupid thing to say. Yes, atheism and atheists exist!
None of those people in Poland were put on this earth to live up to my expectations anymore than you were. So - With that in mind... Why can't everyone simply learn to accept each others differences without all the damn senseless bickering about a community that chose to erect a statue of Jesus Christ in their own town? It's not exactly like they trying to force their will upon you. If you don't like it... Don't go there to look at it! How much simpler can that be!?
Sorry! You think a statue that is 167ft tall is not forcing their beleif on every person in the village.
What say 12% of the village don't beleive in the jesus and every morning its in their face, did they have a say, or they just kept silence as that was safer.
Religion always wants to force their beleif that is why they start with the children, scare the hell out of them, muddle their thinking.
You live your life your way, I'll live mine..... No one forces anything on me that I do not allow. Period
Good to hear !!
I don't consider it that big of a deal but honestly that money could have been spent much better, like for instance the roads....have you ever been to Poland?
No I haven't
I have travelled in other parts of Europe
Would like to do some more

You keep saying your "opinion" about things you know nothing about dear. If you were in charge of Rio de Janeiro...What!? You are going to presume to tell someone whos job it is to run that place and those people "how" they should do THEIR job!? In a culture and a place you know NOTHING about...please. You gotta be kidding me?! Have you ever lived anywhere outside the states? Monday morning quarterback, go over there and do something about it, go volunteer over there and get involved.
"If you were in charge of Rio...are going to presume to tell someone whos job it is to run that place"
I don't get it. Is that a trick question? If I am in charge, then presumably I run that place. lol.
"ave you ever lived anywhere outside the states?" Apparently you didn't even read the comment that you replied to. I was born in Poland, I immigrated to the U.S. And I have lived abroad in places like Ecuador which also has a big statue of Jesus on a mountain side. If it is private money and on private land then I don't really care too much but I still hold that the money could have been better spent on say...feeding the poor? WWJD? LOL.
You might want to proof read your commentary before posting. they vs their and damed vs damn
It is a sad epithet that Poles who were the subjects of a murderous dictatorial communal failure now enjoy more rights expressing their Religious Freedoms than the nation founded explicitly on that right.
I'm seeing such bitterness in these comments. Praying that my God will put someone in your lives that will show you what love really is. The statue is incredible. Thank you to the people who designed and built it. It's not an idol, it's a way of honoring the one true God. May God continue to bless you.
Thank you Poppy :) well said. I must be getting tired, Im outa here......I hope. God bless your civility and Love.
And your would be definition of what love truly is, is your god? The guy who coerces people to love and worship him for his own vanity otherwise he will torture them for eternity? The guy who allows children to get raped and other such horrific evils? That is NOT love!
John 3:16: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Think about it: Would you allow your son to die to save anyone else? God is a perfect example of love and sacrifice. Sin causes "children to be raped and other such horrific evils". I questioned this myself for a long time, but have come to truly believe that we must understand what life is like in the depths of valleys to realize just how wonderful it will be on the mountaintop. I am not coerced to love and worship God by any means. I am truly in awe of Him, and worship him because I see how worthy He is of my praise. God does not torture people, people torture people. As far as being tortured for eternity, I pray you find the love that God offers each person before you have to experience what hell really is - eternity apart from God.
There are 3 types of believers in this world. There are unbelievers, believers, and make believers.
Speaking to the unbelievers: Once you truly believe, not make believe but actually "believe" you can feel something that is not of this world and it is not just in your mind it will come as a physical feeling and you will know something touched you. This is such a wonderful touch and it is "physical". At least a person that is a none believer is being honest. Our churches are full of make believers, people who are there to be a part of society, a club, for entertainment or who are just lonely. But if any of us that truly seek the truth will find what I type about.

I understand that some of us raised in church get disappointed because we don't see any proof and the Bible looses it authenticity because of what we are taught in society. With me I went along and was a make believer and then I heard something I had never heard and it shocked me and then I thought if this is correct then maybe there really is a God. I then started reading and seeking what I had heard, not letting anything stand in my way. And in spite of myself thinking all of my negative thoughts I came to know what I speak.

The Bible says we are tried at every moment we watch all the corruption and we want to fight back but if we do Satan has another one to take that ones place. Your right about the U.S. It is the most blessed country in the world. But I hope we will do what God ask when he says If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
"It is the most blessed country in the world." Prove it.
Doesn't this seem odd? That when people ask about suffering, Christians say god gave us free will, therefor he wont interfere with our suffering but then they will say that god produced this miracle or that, or that he blessed this or that. So apparently god CAN interfere without infringing on our free will but couldn't care less about our suffering.
Oh and to imply that a supreme cosmic deity cares about our artificial borders is belittling to your notion of god.

Normally, I'm not a 'one-lens' guy, but if I was, this is one I would consider. The only issue for me is speed. I've been spoiled by a 2.8 the last few years and giving up 1-1 1/2 stops can be harsh.
The 18-200 is incredibly sharp though. I've heard nothing but great things about this lens.
And if you've got a good noise reduction filter for PS then the speed is a non-issue.
I'm happy for you Frank! Enjoy the fishin' and the shootin'!

You go boy! You should find lots of material up there to shoot if you can keep your hands off the pole, that is.
We will all be looking for shots. Don't forget to look for the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) That lens should be awesome for that!
Do you eat your fish or are you strictly "catch and release". I am one that hopes that you would enjoy one of Gods great gifts to man and that is fresh fish eaten by the hand that caught it. Especially out of a somewhat unspoiled wilderness like Alaska!
Have fun. When do you return?

Thanks Cappy! I will definately be eating some fresh fish immediately after catching any. In fact my buddy that I'm going with was laughing because I told him I was bringing some wasabi and soy sauce. :lol

I did a little research on the northern lights and it looks like being that far North- March and Sept.- October are the best months. The problem with the time that you are going is the skies don't get dark enough for a good viewing although the further south you are in Alaska the better chance you have. I live in Northern Wisconsin and have viewed them in July and August, needless to say there is a huge difference between the two.
Depending on where you are in Alaska, you might be far enough south and past the equinox that the evening sky would get dark enough to show them off. While it won't be the best time, it would still be worth a look to the sky. I would think you would be looking up to the sky once in a while anyway. :) What a trip that will be! Be safe and good luck!

(PhysOrg.com) -- In a recent study published in Biology Letters, a page of science fiction comes to life in a real-life zombie scenario between the ladybug and a parasitical wasp called Dinocampus coccinellae.
The study, led by Fanny Maure, a University of Montreal graduate student, looked at exactly what role the ladybug played in the birth and growth of the D. coccinellae. The female D. coccinellae stings the ladybug and lays her egg within the ladybug host. The larva then hatches and eats its way out of the ladybug and within three weeks has hatched out of the ladybugs abdomen. The ladybug, however, is not dead and still very much alive.
The grub then spins its orange cocoon within the ladybugs legs until it grows into an adult. It was believed that the ladybug served as protection to the cocoon as its colors and erratic twitching scares off predators. However Maure decided to test this theory and exposed the wasp cocoons to lacewings. What she discovered was that the unprotected cocoons were devoured but so were 85 percent of the ones protected by a dead ladybug. However, when the cocoon was protected by a still alive ladybug in its zombie state, only about one third of them were eaten.
It is still unclear how the ladybug survives and still twitches after the larva has left, but Maure believes that the larva may leave behind some type of venom that enables the twitching within the ladybug. Maure also discovered that the longer the ladybug remains alive, the less beneficial it is for the fertility of the growing wasp.
It is believed that this is because the tiny grub is limited to the amount it can eat. If it consumes the ladybug to the point of death, it eats but is less likely to reach maturity without protection. By eating less and allowing the adult ladybug to survive, the grub keeps its protection and reaches maturity, but its development is affected by the lack of food needed for proper development.

Abstract
Host manipulation by parasites not only captures the imagination but has important epidemiological implications. The conventional view is that parasites face a trade-off between the benefits of host manipulation and their costs to fitness-related traits, such as longevity and fecundity. However, this trade-off hypothesis remains to be tested. Dinocampus coccinellae is a common parasitic wasp of the spotted lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata. Females deposit a single egg in the haemocoel of the host, and during larval development the parasitoid feeds on host tissues. At the prepupal stage, the parasitoid egresses from its host by forcing its way through the coccinellid's abdominal segments and begins spinning a cocoon between the ladybird's legs. Remarkably, D. coccinellae does not kill its host during its development, an atypical feature for parasitoids. We first showed under laboratory conditions that parasitoid cocoons that were attended by a living and manipulated ladybird suffered less predation than did cocoons alone or cocoons under dead ladybirds. We then demonstrated that the length of the manipulation period is negatively correlated with parasitoid fecundity but not with longevity. In addition to documenting an original case of bodyguard manipulation, our study provides the first evidence of a cost required for manipulating host behaviour.

(PhysOrg.com) -- Astronomers at The Australian National University have found evidence for the textile that forms the fabric of the Universe.
In findings published in the October Astrophysical Journal, the researchers discovered proof of a vast filament of material that connects our Milky Way galaxy to nearby clusters of galaxies, which are similarly interconnected to the rest of the Universe.
The team included Dr. Stefan Keller, Dr. Dougal Mackey and Professor Gary Da Costa from the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at ANU.
By examining the positions of ancient groupings of stars, called globular clusters, we found that the clusters form a narrow plane around the Milky Way rather than being scattered across the sky, Dr. Keller said.
Furthermore, the Milky Ways said, he said.. In our picture, most of these star clusters are the central cores of small galaxies that have been drawn along the filament by gravity.
Once these small galaxies got too close the Milky Way the majority of stars were stripped away and added to our galaxy, leaving only their cores.
It is thought that the Milky Way has grown to its current size by the consumption of hundreds of such smaller galaxies over cosmic time.

Cosmic strings are originally very thin, but hyperdimensional objects, but when observed from low dimensional perspective, they may appear fuzzy. They exhibit Rayleigh-Plateau and Gregory-Laflamme instabilities typical for hyperdimensional non-Newtonian fluids (they're covered with galaxies like fibbers of slime are covered with droplets).
In aether theory the gravitational waves correspond the indeterministic CMBR noise (i.e. not harmonic waves) - but these fibers can behave like SOFAR channel in underwater and they could enable the spreading of weak harmonic ripples with superluminal speed at limited distance - at least in principle.

Gravitationally bound structures do contract even in an expanding universe. These cosmic filaments may be the largest such structures possible, larger ones were torn apart by the expansion.

Zephyr: Nonsense. but I 5'd you for "fibbers". Probably unintentional, but it made me chuckle.
SteveL: Good point. Normal because we are made of it and most familiar with it. If we ever really observe DM directly, or at least figure out what it is, then it won't be considered not normal any more.
Finally, I love the dark matter filaments illustrations. They look cool. Still think DM is a plug, for now, but it makes for some neat drawings.

Well then, it seems that this is grounds for agreement between plasma-based cosmology and the Big Bang. Keep in mind that the interstellar "clouds" are also filamentary. Birkeland Current magnetic rope structures are also observed regularly connecting the Sun with the Earth.
We see filamentation at all scales, and yet we are frequently told that these filaments occur through chance mechanisms.
If we do not seek out unifying theories, we certainly will never find them.
HannesAlfven
Well then, it seems that there are grounds for agreement between plasma-based cosmology and the more conventional framework.
We see filaments connecting galaxies. We see filaments in galaxies. We see filaments all around us in interstellar space (the interstellar "clouds"). We see filaments regularly connecting the Sun with the Earth.
At what point do we reconsider the notion that all of these filaments are there by chance? If filaments are common, then there is arguably a mechanism holding them together.
In the electric universe, we call it Marklund convection. And it's the same thing that happens to charged particles around transmission lines. The transmission lines act as ion pumps.

Maybe our universe is expanding because we're moving through a greater medium(multiverse) toward an area of lower pressure, so the "bubbles" expand. I just hope no one puts our "bread" in the oven!
Pirouette
But I must say that this article does make me think of the parallels between these cosmic filaments and the neurons in a brain that enable messages to travel from one part of said brain to one or more part(s) in other areas of said brain. The neurons are an information superhighway and I'm wondering if these cosmic filaments spoken of could possibly be something similar to neurons. I need to study the brain further because this possibility is highly intriguing. For some reason, the term in "firing synapses" comes to mind. I must have read it somewhere and it stuck with me.
Pirouette
also:
Words below in parentheses indicate the comparison of the cosmic filaments to the brain's firing synapses.
In this Wikipedia illustration, the neuron sends a message via axon (filament) utilizing "electrical impulses" toward other neurons who, in turn send messages back and forth to other neurons. In this cosmic filaments article, I think there may be a parallel with stars (neurons), the axon moving electrical impulses through the axon firing synapses (cosmic filaments), and the space between neurons being gray matter could parallel tbe space between stars and galaxies (dark matter). This possibility is giving me a slight chill.
Crazy_council
the evidence ( lenzin ) could point to other things rather than dark matter/energy.
If the fabric of the universe is spinning, this could account for a lot of the evidence we find for dark matter/force.
Pirouette
But the main concern for some people, I think, would be that if these cosmic filaments do, in reality, electronically and gravitationally connect stars and galaxies to each other throughout the Universe, might it not indicate a designer (created) Universe, and not one well organized by mere chance?
Rawa1 said "IMO these dark matter fibbers conceptually corresponds the worm holes and dark strings. They're not worm holes in strict sense, but they still enable to spread information faster with the rest of Universe, than along another directions."
I agree. It's either a Communications line, OR similar to a spider's web for catching and holding stars.
I am considering Fibonacci numbers and other beautiful works of nature, including the brain.
I can see these miracles of Nature increased exponentially in cosmic terms. Should I say it?

I have a feeling that your quote was meant for me. If so, thank you. There are vast similarities between the macro and micro. Many years ago, I think it was in the1980s, my then young son had an amazing program on his computer that showed Fractals, whereby no matter where you clicked on the large pattern on the screen, it zoomed in to show the same pattern again, but in micro. I found it fascinating but I still don't know how it was done.
Regarding my brain analogy, the firing synapses does remind me of the electromagnetic current of the "rope" connection between all of these "globes" in the Universe. Truly fascinating, I want more!!

(Phys.org) -- University of California, San Diego computer scientists explored a new approach to secure browser design in a paper presented in August 2012 at the 21st USENIX Security Symposium, the foremost research conference on computer network security. The authors are computer science professor Sorin Lerner and computer science Ph.D. students Dongseok Jang and Zachary Tatlock.
Over the past 15 years, Web-based applications have become commonplace. They are used for a wide variety of activities, from interacting with a bank or healthcare provider to managing business functions or spending leisure time interacting on a social network. As a result of this ubiquity, hackers have learned to exploit security flaws in order to access the wealth of private information tracked and accessed by Web browsers. Indeed, security breaches have become so frequent that there are now annual competitions where security experts show off their hacking chops by breaking into the latest versions of browsers, and companies such as Google pay cash prizes to people who report bugs that pose a security threat.
Because users generally want a browser that is trustworthy, secure browsing is a high priority for software developers. Yet current browsers are in fact very fragile. They are complex pieces of software with rich features that allow for flexibility and programmability, and even small bugs can make the browser vulnerable to attack. Indeed, browser vulnerabilities have been used to infiltrate the internal networks of American defense contractors and leading tech firms. Attempts to improve browser security are often ad-hoc engineering efforts; and even when formal guarantees are provided, they come in the form of proofs over a model or idealization of the browser, not the browser itself. A buggy implementation can invalidate intended guarantees and still leave users open to attack.
Jang and Tatlock, the computer science Ph.D. students, also previewed their work in a presentation to the first Center for Networked Systems (CNS) Security Day in May 2012. They explained that previous verification techniques for browser security operate on a model or abstraction of the browser, and not on its actual implementation. This has created what Tatlock calls a ‘formality gap’, a discrepancy between what is verified and what is implemented. It is through this gap that hackers can infiltrate a browser even if it has been verified using strong formal methods.
There is one known way to bridge this formality gap: implement the software in a proof assistant and use the proof assistant’s interactive environment to formally prove, in full formal detail, that the software implementation is correct. More specifically, the programmer defines a specification stating what the code should do, and then uses the proof assistant to formally prove that the code in fact satisfies this specification, beginning with the most basic axioms and then building on them. Because of the precise way in which the program has been constructed, and the foundational nature of the proof, this kind of formal verification provides extremely strong guarantees.
In the past, however, this kind of verification has faced a number of practical barriers. One of the main challenges is that building formal proofs for applications with millions of lines of code is extremely time consuming, if not completely impossible. As a result, programmers using proof assistants have either restricted themselves to verifying stripped-down versions of their applications, or have had to expand heroic effort to perform the proofs, spending much more time and programmer-power than would be practical.
Jang, Tatlock and Lerner speculated: What if there were ways to make the proofs easier by restricting the code that must be verified to a few hundred lines (as opposed to a few million)? The research team devised a technique, dubbed ‘formal shim verification’, for doing just this. Formal shim verification says Lerner, consists of “creating a small browser kernel which mediates access to resources for all other browser components, and then formally verifying that this browser kernel is correct in a proof assistant.” In other words, only a small part of the application that is vulnerable to outside scrutiny and attack will be verified using a proof assistant.
Following these design parameters, the team created Quark, a Web browser that uses a kernel-based architecture similar to Google Chrome. In particular, the heart of Quark is a small kernel responsible for mediating access to the rest of the application. Unlike Chrome’s kernel, however, the Quark kernel has been verified in full formal detail using a proof assistant, allowing it to make strong guarantees about the security of the browser. As Jang explains, Quark “exploits formal shim verification and enables us to verify security properties for a million lines of code while reasoning about only a few hundred lines of code in the kernel.” This critical distinction between a verified kernel and the non-verified components allowed the researchers to incorporate a number of state-of-the-art implementations into the non-verified parts of Quark, while still maintaining strong security guarantees. For example, Quark is able to use the WebKit open-source layout engine, the same layout engine used in Safari and Chrome. Using such realistic components has made Quark into a practical and usable browser, which can successfully run complex pages like Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook and Amazon.
During the prototyping phase of Quark, one thing became clear: “When forced to choose between adding complexity to the browser kernel,” says Jang, “it was always better to keep the kernel as simple as possible.” As a result, the current version of Quark is in some cases too simplistic. For example, it does not support some standard features of the Web, such as third-party cookies, and in some cases it enforces non-standard security policies. Despite these current limitations, Quark is still capable of running many complex Web applications, including Facebook and Gmail.
Tatlock, Jang and Lerner are determined that this is only the first implementation of Quark. They already have some ideas about how to include a number of standard browser features without severely complicating their kernel or having to work through a fundamental redesign. Concludes Tatlock: “Our approach will handle more standard policies given design changes to our prototype and further engineering effort.”

There."
Dietary intake of fish oil can also decrease the risk of atherosclerosis, arrhythmias, heart attack, sudden cardiac death and even health failure. Dr. Lavie adds that although there is a smaller benefit in reducing heart failure death—9 percent mortality benefit in a major recent randomized controlled trial—this is still very impressive given patients' grave prognosis.
"If we translate this finding, it means that we only need to treat 56 patients for four years to prevent one death," he said. "And we are talking about a very safe and relatively inexpensive therapy."
Most of the evidence for the cardioprotective benefits supports the use of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), the long-chain fatty acids in the omega-3 family. According to Dr. Lavie, EPA and DHA work by getting into the membranes of cells and, in doing so, may help to improve the heart's electrical activity, vascular tone, plaque stabilization and blood pressure, among other benefits. Studies show that the reduction in CV events is inversely related to the tissue level EPA and, even more so, DHA.
Based on these findings, and because the body does not produce its own essential fatty acids, the authors recommend that healthy individuals should "Patients should talk with their doctors about whether a fish oil supplement is needed to get the right amount and, in turn, benefit from the associated cardiovascular protection."
Dr. Lavie and his team came across only a few negative studies, including a recent one that showed no benefit in post-MI patients, but it has raised the possibility that omega-3 fatty acids may not provide as much additional protective benefits in low-risk patients already receiving extensive and rigorous post-MI therapies. "It was a one-year study that enrolled fewer than 4,000 patients and the majority were using aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors—the best of modern medicine," he said. "It may be that their risk was so low to start, that a larger study with longer follow-up would be required to better assess the true efficacy of omega-3 in such relatively low-risk patients."
Authors say further studies are needed to investigate and determine optimal dosages, as well as the relative ration of DHA and EPA that provides maximal heart protection in those at risk of cardiovascular disease, and in the treatment of atherosclerosis, arrhythmias and heart attacks.
Interestingly, culture has historically played a role; sometimes dubbed the "Eskimo factor," research shows cultures that have traditionally supported a diet rich in fish oil (Asian and Alaskan American populations) had a lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease and mortality, including a reduced prevalence of atherosclerosis and heart disease, compared to European and United States populations where consumption of fish is lower. Ironically, the introduction of Western dietary practices into Asian and Native American cultures may be diluting the cardioprotective benefits enjoyed by these populations by both reducing the overall intake of fish oils, as well as overwhelming its benefits with other deleterious dietary practices, including high intakes of saturated and trans fats and cholesterol.

Climate change is a topic that impacts the weather not only globally, but also locally. While some people may be concerned about the melting ice sheets at the far corners of the Earth, what most really want to know is "how will global warming affect me?" -- and they often turn to their local weatherperson to find out.
A study released today study by the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication in Fairfax, Va., showed that 27 percent of broadcast meteorologists -- who are, according to the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, "often the most visible representatives of science in U.S. households" -- believe that global warming is a scam.
According to the National Science Foundation’s 2010 Science and Engineering Indicators, television is the number one source the public turns to for information about science and technology. Broadcast meteorologists are often the only people at TV news stations with a science background. But the education and experience of those who deliver news about the weather varies dramatically.
"In television, when it comes to weather, there is an extremely wide range of education sets," said Jim Gandy, chief meteorologist at WLTX-TV in Columbia, S.C. "Some have bachelor’s degrees, master’s degrees, and Ph.D.'s, but you also have some without."
When a topic such as climate change comes up in the news, broadcast meteorologists -- no matter what their educational background -- are often thrust into the spotlight. Some embrace the opportunity and try to educate their audiences on the science, while others avoid it at all costs.
"People are uninformed and believe climate change is a hoax," said Gandy. "I occasionally respond to comments posted on our station's website, but you better know your science and get your facts straight before you post on my website."
Some meteorologists surveyed said that there is a lot of conflicting information about climate change.
"Science is about questioning things and I think we should all be in the middle, question the information," said Brad Sowder, First Alert Meteorologist at KOAA-TV in Colorado Springs, Colo. "I have been more on the side of a skeptic."
Another weathercaster who wanted to remain anonymous felt that the topic of climate change is less about the science and more about politics. "Personally, I think that global warming is a political issue, and I feel like it is safer to stay out of it," he said.
The survey also found that 62 percent of broadcast meteorologists want to report more on climate change.
"We have a good comprehensive look at television weathercasters from this survey," said Kris Wilson, a senior lecturer with the School of Journalism at University of Texas at Austin and one of the lead investigators of the survey.
Beginning in July, the next phase of the National Science Foundation-funded study will begin. A test case at Gandy’s station will include 30-second segments in some of the weathercasts to educate viewers about climate change.
"It will be a year-long effort using our resources on-air and on the Internet in an effort to educate the public about climate change past, present, and future," said Gandy. "I wish the public knew how difficult it is to have knowledge of climate science. Simply being a meteorologist is not enough, and this is a mistake that some television meteorologists make."

THe Earth has warmed and cooled and warmed since the little ice age ended ca. 1800.
GW is a very complicated issue but if the so called expert scientists don't operate w/ total transparency so that their work can be replicated (this is how real science works - "consensus" is for layman) then we will never get to the bottom of this AND we will be scammed by the politicians and charlatans.

So they changed their story to "anthropologic climate change".
Meanwhile, they continue to ignore precise space-age measurements that show why Earth's climate and Earth's heat source are always changing ["Earth's heat source - The Sun", Energy & Environment 20 (2009) 131-144].

To the climate change deniers- we can only hope that the almost perfect correlation between CO2 levels over the last 15 million years and global climate/temperatures is a hoax - cuz if it is not- we are in deep trouble as a species.

"The Weather Channel's most prominent climatologist is advocating that broadcast meteorologists be stripped of their scientific certification if they express skepticism about predictions of manmade catastrophic global warming."
Ronan
Bearing that in mind...again, what are you getting at? Unless you can show me a situation in the past where temperatures rose dramatically and then stopped rising (for whatever reason) once carbon dioxide began to go up (showing that carbon dioxide really doesn't affect temperature, and that CO2 levels are only an effect of temperature shifts, not a cause), then your argument doesn't seem to hold much water.

Folks, I screamed so hard for our team last night that I literally can’t talk today. But in true 26th man (and woman) fashion, I will rest up and be back later for more. God, I can’t wait.
I’ve got some photoshop lightening, cropping, etc. to do with my pics, but when I’m back soon, it’ll be so you can enjoy the Shea NLCS Game 6 experience along with me. (And also meet some other bloggers! We had a meet-and-greet before the game, which was a ton of fun. In the pics? Yeah, look for the shortest blogger and who do you get?)
Diamondvision kept letting fans know all night that the team loves us. We got messages from David Wright, Paul Lo Duca, and Carlos Delgado. All about how rocking we are. Well, Metsies. Expect more tonight!!
THE TEAM. THE TIME. IS NOW.
More soon! xx
(P.S. For any of you who want to rock the Mets body art, the clubhouse store sells temporary tattoos for $4 that–I learned–truly do come off easily with rubbing alcohol. I think it’s an extra fun way to support the team!)

Yes, that's right- this is what phenomenal & gracious PnP pilot Russell did for our special boxer named Ivan Finn. He flew from TX to SC just to pick up our special Ivan (which SonJa can vouch for) in order to fly him to safety back in TX. UNBELIEVABLE! THX RUSSELL!!!! You are most definitely a flying angel!!
Like so many, Ivan Finn had a VERY RUFF start in life. A huge special THX also goes to Cynthia with Almost Home Dogz Rescue in TX who agreed to find Ivan Finn a safe FURever home (meanwhile in their foster-care program) & another special THX goes to SonJa for taking EXTREMELY good care of this boy until we could get this long transport worked out! Never in my mind did I dream that we could get this done w/ only 1 pilot!!!
This boy is SAFE THX to so many people!!! It takes so many!!!
Ivan, my sweet boy, may you ALWAYS be SAFE & LOVED from now on!!
THX Ute w/ Blue Ridge Boxer Rescue for also helping with Ivan.

The Latest Updates On: American Idol Season 12 * Dancing With The Stars 16 * The Voice Season 4 * The X Factor
International singing sensation “Charice,” Disney star & granddaughter of Reyna ng Kundiman Sylvia La Torre “Anna Maria Perez de Tagle” and American Idol Season 10 finalist “Thia Megia” being groomed for the role of Kim in Miss Saigon made the rounds in media last year.
This year, American Idol runner-up Jessica Sanchez is being considered to play the lead role in the long-rumored film adaptation of Broadway and West End hit, “Miss Saigon.”
In a report by Broadway World, the original Kim star Lea Salonga thinks she would be great for the part. “If she’s the one that they’ve chosen, or she’s somebody in serious consideration, then that’s a good thing,” Lea said. “We all know she’s talented, we all know she’s actually quite beautiful.”
“The film, which is still in the early stages of development, had previously announced Lee Daniels as director; no official release date has yet been set,” the report added.

Experience PCC
In addition to preparing people for success through academic endeavors, Pitt Community College features an intercollegiate athletics department that is educating and empowering student-athletes for success in life, higher education and the workforce by emphasizing teamwork, character and sportsmanship.
The college fields four intercollegiate teams—men’s baseball, men’s basketball, women’s fast-pitch softball and women’s volleyball—that compete in the National Junior College Athletic Association’s (NJCAA) Region X Conference.
PCC athletic teams have been extremely competitive over the years and have won consistently at the regional and district levels. In addition to capturing conference titles, several.
Baseball
Started in 1995, PCC’s baseball program has emerged as a perennial national contender that has produced a number of athletes who have continued their playing careers at four-year institutions and professionally.
Two former Bulldogs, Freddie Bynum and Lonnie Chisenhall, have reached the Major Leagues with the Oakland Athletics and Cleveland Indians, respectively.
Since 2006, the baseball program has competed under the direction of Tommy Eason, a former East Carolina University standout and minor leaguer. In his first seven seasons, Eason guided the Bulldogs to a 240-110 record, three Region X Conference Tournament championships, and the college’s first-ever appearance in the NJCAA Division I World Series in Grand Junction, Colo.
Basketball
In a state rich in basketball history, PCC took its first turn on the hardwood in 1969, struggling at first –even disappearing entirely for a season—before finding momentum and success with Charles Coburn as coach. Coburn, a former PCC basketball player and the college’s first athletic director, compiled a 169-151 record at Pitt before stepping down in December 1993 due to illness.
Though PCC discontinued basketball after Coburn’s retirement, the program was resurrected15 years later and returned to NJCAA play at the start of the 2008-09 season.
The Bulldogs are now led by Pitt County native Darrick Mullins, who took over midway through the 2010-11 season. After posting a 7-9 mark with a team that had gone 0-7 before his arrival, Mullins went 20-12 in his first full season as coach.
Softball
Like baseball, PCC’s fast-pitch softball program has also flourished on the diamond and in generating players who transfer to four-year colleges and universities to continue their academic and playing careers.
In addition to producing numerous All-Region X Conference performers, the program made back-to-back appearances in the NJCAA Division I Fast-Pitch Softball Championship in St. George, Utah, in 2010 and 2011.
Since Junior Bailey took the helm in 2006, the PCC softball program had recorded a 217-115-1 mark entering the 2013 season.
Volleyball
Tom Marsh, a PCC psychology instructor, is responsible for getting Pitt’s volleyball program off the ground in 2000 and leading the Bulldogs to three regional championships and a pair of national tournament appearances.
William Way took the reins when Marsh first retired from coaching in 2005 and led PCC to an 85-50 record but never could achieve post-season success. Marsh returned to the sidelines in 2009 and guided the Bulldogs to a 92-44 mark before retiring once again at the end of the 2012 campaign.
PCC hired Caitlin Wooten to lead its volleyball program in February. The Maryland native has previous experience as an assistant volleyball coach with N.C. Wesleyan College (three seasons) and as an East Carolina Junior Volleyball Club coach.

As a human who keeps his reproductive organs on the outside, I feel I am ill equipped to discuss this. But as it’s probably the most important issue in gaming since, well, ever, I feel it’s my duty to chime in on the subject.
The kraken of misogyny has risen out of the murky waters of online gaming in what seems, to me, to be very recent times. As a white, heterosexual male who prides himself on not acting like a complete cockshine, I wasn’t aware it existed.
A few months ago, I requested to add a fellow Twitter user to my PS3 friends list, as she enjoyed a game of Modern Warfare 3 now and then. Her response was “Only if you promise not to get abusive if you get beaten by a girl.” I thought she was joking, but I soon discovered that she wasn’t. I was shocked, disgusted, and most predominantly baffled by what I discovered as I discussed the matter with other female gamers.
Don’t take my word for it. One only has to look at Fat, Ugly, or Slutty to see what female gamers have to put up with on a daily basis. Or look at the completely uncalled for abuse directed at Anita Sarkeesian and Felicia Day. As I implied earlier, this doesn’t directly affect me, but you can be as sure as shit that it indirectly affects me.
I happen to quite like women. I have many female friends. Online, offline, and in JPEG format. My wife’s a woman. My daughter will be one eventually. I’d quite like to share the experience of multiplayer video games with these people, but these misogynist dickslaps are ruining it for me and everyone like me. When I ask a woman to play games online with me and her first response is to ask me not to abuse her, things be fucked.
So where does it come from and why does it happen? Women have been poorly represented in video games for decades, but I don’t remember any hatred towards them like we’re experiencing now. I remember that the editor of Your Sinclair was famously a woman. Danielle Bunten was a transgendered game developer, but nobody cared. She made M.U.L.E. for fuck’s sake, why would it matter?
My humble opinion is that it comes down to two simple facts: 1) Gaming has truly opened up to the mainstream now. It is no longer reserved for nerds. 2) Xbox Live, the PSN, and online PC gaming has given all the honking great fuckwits both a voice and anonymity.
Given those two enabling technologies, misogynist gamers can now yell at women what would once be muttered towards their shoes.
That doesn’t answer the why though. I have no idea why it happens. Do these people have something to fear from women playing “their” games? Are they intimidated by the presence of women? Do they just truly dislike them for no discernible reason? I have no idea.
I’d like to round this off with a helpful answer and a joke, but I don’t have an answer and it really isn’t a laughing matter. Real people who I like and respect are being threatened with death and rape on a daily basis. Real women are being driven away from something I care about by the most obnoxious of arseholes.
The only thing we can do is confront it when we see it. Don’t let it go without comment. Report it to the gaming service provider. They generally do give a shit. Make it unacceptable.
As another female, gaming friend of mine once brilliantly said, “Politely point at the ‘No Douchebags’ sign on the wall.”

ABC targeted the $1.8 million in consulting fees Gingrich received from federally backed mortgage company Freddie Mac:
Through Gingrich Group, the former House speaker consulted for reportedly $1.8 million for eight years for Freddie Mac, the federally backed mortgage giant that most conservatives say should be eliminated. While Gingrich has denied lobbying for them, he hasn’t provided a viable explanation of what kind of services he provided to an organization that he himself recently said should be abolished.:
The connections with Washington insiders and multi-million dollar corporations makes it hard for Gingrich to cast himself as an outsider and clouds his “new Newt” campaign, experts say.
“Even if there’s no ethical or legal impropriety, the optics are bad,” said John Pitney Jr., politics professor at Claremont McKenna College who worked for Gingrich..
Attention! Hear ye American Political Shoppers!
Before ye pass through ye Election Doors, heed ye this above cited exemplary definition of contemporary “Hypocrisy”.
Hear Ye, Verily.
Newt’s team should go over the list of records Obama has concealed, pull Newt’s counterparts, and begin publishing.
Newt is in for some very tough times. Our ultra-left, captive media will begin investigating Newt’s background. They’ll want key info like who gave what as presents at Newt’s first wedding. And, they’ll want to know why Newt only got a “B” in the undergraduate course. The same media will be able to hypothesize the REAL reason why Newt can’t provide details, today.
Honest observers must be able to contrast Newt’s candor with Hussein’s mendacity!
Ooo, it’s the big bad Boogeyman! Boogey, boogey, boogey!
Look at the list of recipients of F&F political campaign contributions. Sort by total amount. You do not see a Republican name until way down the list. I do not think Gingrich’s name is on the list. Obama’s name was #2 by 2008.
Gingrich has ties to F&F? Really? How about Obama’s ties to F&F?!?
The eventual winner for the Republican side will not only stand up to the press but challenge them at every turn. Challenge every word they utter and call them liars to their face on their own networks. Challenge them on not only the reasons for some of their questions but any facts that are included in the questions. Always answer each and every question with one of your own directed at the moderator as to why they would ask that question of you and not Obama, which when you look back would almost always be the case. Always redirect questions to the treatment of Obama compared to yourself or the Republican Party. Especially throw back in their faces Saul Alinsky and the other Marxist creeps lurking in the halls of the White House. Throw back in their faces the low life behavior of Edwards that the press didn’t covered until the last and the ethics of blow job Billy and the under the desk escapades with a barely out of her teens intern.
Your opponent isn’t Obama, it’s the press. Hammer them and challenge them the likes of which has never been seen before.
– lips to their ears, we can only hope!
And Newt is likely the only person now running that can do it – and do it well at that. Chris Christie is about the only other Republican I can think of that is capable as Newt in this regard.
Mr. “I’m presidential” Romney can’t or won’t do it but that is how Obama will be defeated. Defeat the MSM – then Obama. He’ll be truly naked without them.
“Experts say …” Ah, yes. This is how they do it. Claim whatever the hell you want to say about a candidate, or a policy, or a scientific theory, or WHATtever — the truth, or relative truth, of the claim is irrelevant, so long as EXPERTS SAY. And the great thing for the Obama Media is that they can ascribe “experts say” to any person or group who poses a threat to The One. Amazing, isn’t it?
So, for how long has this been going on? Unfortunately, I don’t know. I’ve only been aware of it for the past decade or so, prior to that I naively believed that our major papers and nightly news outlets were interested in being as objective as possible. Ha! What an idiot I was. Then came the atrocity of 9/11, and I started paying more attention to the communiques of college-trained journalists. I needed to know what was going on out there. I craved news information as never before. And in the process I made a great personal discovery. It began with the European Press — more particularly, the British Press. I began to get the sense that, gosh, these people who I thought were our friends and appreciative allies actually kinda had it out for us. Especially after President Bush, with the full backing of the U.S. Congress and national public opinion, decided to take down the Big Dog, Saddam Hussein. I started to notice that the media had no interest whatsoever in interviewing anti-Saddam voices. No no. It was, rather, always the same guy whose “narratives” they wanted to hear: Abu the one-legged carwash attendant. And he could always be counted upon to say the god-awful things about American policies and American troop conduct that Eurotrash leftists SO wanted to hear.
That was a real learning experience for me.
And then this rabid anti-U.S. bias migrated to our own shores, and soon we had the New York Times sending out its top reporters to interview this same Abu fella, and fixating on the aberration of Abu Grahib, ad nauseum, and giving free advice to Islamic terror organizations on how to stay a step ahead of American (and cooperative Western) stratagems to roll up al Qaeda & Co.
I asked myself: Isn’t there some law against aiding and abetting the enemy in time of war? How can America’s “newspaper of record” get away with this crap? And why are the people so numb to the outrage? Where the hell am I?
So, anyway, to make a long story short, I now know EXACTLY what we traditional, patriotic Americans are up against. The American Left is a wing of the International Left. The MSM are almost to the man, card-carrying members of this leftist mindset and agenda. We are so screwed! And now they are systematically targeting every GOP presidential hopeful that comes down the pike. It began, by the most vicious of means, with the smearing of Sarah Palin and, yes, her family, including her newborn. Since then the Obama Media (which had no interest whatsoever in Rev. Wright or the Ayers terrorists), with support from feckless, so-called “conservative” talking-head elites (like Bill Kristol, Karl Rove, Charles Krauthhammer [when he's off his meds], etc.) knee-capped early front-runners Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry, and Herman Cain. Now they’re whipping up a nice vat of slime for Newt Gingrich. And after that, it will be a simple matter of pulling out every last peg — no matter how sleazy or bigoted — to destroy Mitt Romney.
And we will have plenty of Obama stalking horses, Ronpaulians, and assorted self-immolating candidate groupies here on PJMedia (and elsewhere in the rightwing blogosphere) HELPING the MSM leftists to put America’s worst president ever back in office for another four years of sheer audio-visual misery that no amount of prayer and alcohol will assuage.
And when that happens, I will truly no longer care. I will cancel my cable (yeah, like that’ll be a huge loss). I will delete ALL of my news-media bookmarks. I will … I will join a monastery. No. My wife wouldn’t allow it. But I will TUNE OUT completely. And gladly. I will turn to stocking up on ammo, novels. and freeze-dried food. I have enough music, old movies, and T.V. series on backup drives to see me through to my dying days.
Because if Obama gets another four years, he will truly ruin everything that this country once stood for. And it will be every man for himself.
Please, while Newt did not lobby in the precise legalese of federal law, he did lobby in the language of a sane person. Selling your influence to drive policy decisions in the favor of your clients is lobbying.
It’s a sad statement to the state of our party that a snake like Newt is even in the running. He respects America as much as his wives.
Who is Huntsman?
I imagine the following riposte from Gingrich:
“Fellow Americans, you may have heard or read recently that, in my years as a private citizen, I earned approximately $2 million by providing advice to Freddie Mac, one of the two federally-organized and subsidized mortgage giants. Also, I’ve organized a health-care-oriented think tank, the Center for Health Transformation, of which a number of large health-care companies are dues-paying members.
“A number of papers, including the Washington Post, and a larger number of Websites, including that of the American Broadcasting Corporation, are trying to make these enterprises sound like crimes. Yet no one has even hinted that I’ve done anything criminal, or even ethically questionable. It’s all about appearances: Newt Gingrich has made some money by providing advice to people and companies he knows, so something shady has to be behind it!
“Well, my friends, I invite anyone to find a shady dealing in those efforts, by myself or anyone else connected with either of them. And note this: The source of all the information about either of them is my campaign. I’ve not only released the financials of those undertakings; I’ve also released the Center for Health Transformation’s donor list, which I was not legally required to do. You see, I believe that a man who seeks the highest office in the world has an obligation — an ethical obligation — to be forthcoming about his doings, past and present. They’re the best possible guide to how he’ll act in the future.
“Compare my degree of transparency about my affairs to that of Barack Hussein Obama and the organizations that have promoted and supported him. Do we know anything but the bare bones about President Obama’s past? How did he go from an obscure community organizer in Chicago to the top of the poliltical world? Have we seen his transcripts from Occidental University? Do we know anything about his years at Columbia University, where he studied law? What professors remember him at either school? What do they have to say about him?
“What about his earlier life? He had a mentor named Frank, mentioned in his autobiography, who was apparently extremely important to him. What was Frank’s full name? Could it have been Frank Marshall Davis, the revolutionary Communist organizer of the Sixties and Seventies?
“His Chicago years are just as much a mystery. Just how deeply influenced was he by Reverend Jeremiah Wright? How deeply involved was he with terrorists Bill Ayres and Bernardine Dohrn? What about his involvements with Tony Rezko and Alex Giannoulias? Did he or did he not get a shady “sweetheart deal” with which to finance the purchase of his mansion in Chicago? And did he collaborate with former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich in the attempt to sell his seat in the United States Senate?
“Friends, I believe in full disclosure. I’ve made it a principle of my campaign. Now it’s time for you to compare my record, on that subject and all related ones, to that of President Obama. Decide for yourself whom you’ll believe — and come November 6, 2012, whom you’ll support. Thank you for your time and attention.”
(Exit stage right to wild sustained cheers from the crowd.)
Well done! *applause*
As usual from the left we see the politics of lies and personal destruction.
I have to admit, one thing I definitely like about Newt is that he doesn’t take any BS from the MSM. He knows how to fight back. He has also been very good about not joining in on MSM efforts to get the repub candidates to spend all their time trashing each other, instead of Obama.
Please note that Newt made about 200K as a “consultant” for two Fed outfits which incompetently lost hundreds of billions. Was it his advice which led to the losses? This clown is bought and paid for by the International Bankers, including the Federal Reserve, aka Rothschild West.His personal life betrays his amorality. He is a Rino- John Edwards puppet; a Herman Cain with brains.
Mothers, don’t let your boys grow up to be Newts.
My God! Has it come to the point that our defense of a presidential candidate (Newt) is that he’s done nothing criminal. The MSM is not friendly, to be sure, but conservatives will not win the White House by running against them. Newt is a duplicitous clown at best, and a deceptive seller of influence at worst.
The Newtster carries more baggage than an Amtrak porter. Obama must pray each night for him to be the GOP nominee. It’ll be like shooting fish in a barrel. Republican Senators and Congress members must be quaking at being pulled down by an Obama landslide. Wake up, folks! We’re looking foolish to the rest of the country in entertaining thoughts of this clown..)

Inverted Hollywood: The Pitch for e-Knowledge
Abstract
To open this article, I begin with a confession. While I have learned enormously from research articles and scholarly texts, I have also learned a lot from movies. Like most typical pre-service teachers, when I entered my teacher education program, I had ingested more celluloid than I had academic articles. To frame this chapter, I am going to fuse the theme of increasing the use of online resources in teacher education with movie making: I am going to give you a movie pitch for the Public Knowledge Project - The First Installment. I am intentionally choosing a movie pitch script for this chapter to illustrate several points. Not the least of which is that scholarly communication in general (through online or any means) has a problem of Inverted Hollywood. Scholars or academics have wonderfully substantial content to deliver but we often lack the means to motivate users to visit our web sites and to read our articles. Hollywood, on the other hand, can motivate high interest amongst the public but can rarely deliver any substantial content (Norman, 1993, p.5). In this chapter, I intend to make the analysis of the Public Knowledge Project more 'Hollywood' and, in the process, hopefully motivate a few readers to visit the Public Knowledge Project website

Brokaw: 'They saved the world, nothing less' Tom Brokaw returned to his alma mater Friday to participate in the W.O. Farber Center for Civic Leadership, a conference in which members of the World War III generation addressed issues of citizenship, leadership and character with their Baby Boomer counterparts. Brokaw, author of the best-selling The Greatest Generation, a book on the sacrifices of the World War II generation, spoke early Friday afternoon in Slagle Auditorium. by M. Jill Sundstrom As a new millennium bears down upon us, Tom Brokaw says today�s generation must focus beyond narrow self interest, building strength out of community and common destiny, much like what Brokaw calls the �greatest generation� of the Great Depression and World War II.
Speaking at The University of South Dakota April 16 to an audience who came to hear him address the World War II Conference hosted by the W.O. Farber Center for Civic Leadership, the NBC Nightly News anchorman praised the greatest generation, the subject of his best-selling book.
�They saved the world. Nothing less than that,� he said. �Each of us here today is a beneficiary of the sacrifices of those times, but most of all that idea that we have a common purpose, whatever individual ideas there may be.
�Individual freedom. When we think of what the world was like at the beginning of the 20th century and now what it�s like at the end of that century, the most powerful idea is that of freedom,� Brokaw continued. �And the generation about which I wrote provided the underpinnings for that idea and it only flourished and expanded in the 50 years after the end of the war.�
Brokaw added that �we should be proud patrons of the idea of freedom as the new millennium is upon us.�
But this is a challenging time for America.
�We�re back to sailing uncharted seas because the changes of the world are so profound,� Brokaw said. �The future is so uncertain. The challenge we face now is who we are and what we want for our place in the world. It is a testing time for America.�
Brokaw is concerned that there is �almost no regard for common ground� in these times of narrow focus on self interest. There is no civil rights movement, no Vietnam, no Watergate, Ronald Reagan or John F. Kennedy to capture America�s attention, he said.
The Clinton/Lewinsky scandal was one without anyone to cheer for, Brokaw added, �from Clinton�s reckless behavior, compounded by lies, to Kenneth Starr�s zealotry and the Republican fervor to air every detail whether it fit the scenario or not. And the media was caught up in a giant game of ?gotcha.� �
Still, Brokaw calls this an exciting, dynamic time for America, a country which must build upon its distinctions of cultural diversity and industrial achievements.
�Wherever we live, whatever our faith or economic interest in this great melting pot of a nation, we have a common destiny,� Brokaw said. �That is the legacy of the greatest generation. We should not shirk from sharing what we�ve earned and learned with the rest of the world.
�We�ve been tested before with what we hoped was the last great war,� he continued. �We�ve survived other wars and constitutional crises, and we�ve emerged whole and strong from the impeachment process of the past year. We are a robust nation that has the best the world has to offer.
�We owe it to ourselves and the greatest generation to seize this moment and raise our standards to the next level so that 50 years from now, another University of South Dakota graduate can write a book and say that, too, was another greatest generation.�

Consumers are reaping the benefits of the recent steady decline in gas prices as South Dakotans enter the middle of the summer driving season. AAA predicts that lower gas prices will help motivate a record 42.3 million Americans.
AAA projects 128,700 South Dakotans will travel over the holiday, a five percent increase over last year's holiday period. Eighty-nine percent of South Dakota travelers will be getting there by private motor vehicle (up four percent over July 4, 2011), five percent by air (a ten percent jump over one year ago), and six percent by other means, such as bus or train...
Today's national average price for a gallon of regular self-serve gasoline is $3.40 This is ten cents cheaper than the price one week ago, 25 cents cheaper than one month ago, 18 cents cheaper than one year ago, and 54 cents cheaper than the year-to-date peak price of $3.94 in early April. The national average price at the pump has now dropped 14 days in a row and 69 of the previous 71 days. The nationwide average price has not been this low since January 27, 2012, almost five months ago.
South Dakota's least expensive gasoline today is found once again in North Sioux City, where the citywide average is $3.272 for regular self-serve. The state's most expensive gasoline is in Pine Ridge at $3.899.

funny, i'm still waiting for an answer from you crunchfit. you may not be an anglophobe, but you seem to be happy to ignore we french. and then complain on another page that APV is ignoring you. (do you have a man crush?)
what's the word i'm looking for? double standards or hypocrite. can't decide. you choose.
btw, i'm afraid the anglo-french arguments are very simple, and are being made by the powers that be, i.e. not any of us. i think it is time to just agree to disagree and see how the cookie crumbles. it's out of our hands. being polite is not. let's focus on that instead.

@ APV1
My questions are direct and simple. Surely, if your argument is actually valid it would have been easier to answer the questions then spend time picking out parts of comments. Not to mention, a bunch of those comments are from one poster and many are about those involved in the decision making, not the English people.
Anyway, I'm not an anglophobe and you posted some of that comment before to get me to respond. Now I have and you won't answer my questions. It seems to me like you don't have a good answer, to be honest. Maybe you do though and in that case, maybe you could provide an answer.

@ crunchfit - here's why I can't be bothered anymore. The Anglophobes have got their wish - another opportunity to have a go and not discuss rugby. The labelling of a whole nation and / or all of its supporters is shameful:
typically English and arrogant
Arrogant English as usual!
WOW the Enger-lish are looking pretty stupid now aren't they??? hahahaha BOOM
The greedy English amateurs
the utter arrogance and insubordination of your moronic bartering
English rugby is a laughing stock not only due to your endless stupidity
You're greedy and inherently dishonest
the greedy English
the English made fools of themselves AGAIN
your greasy tills and greed-inspired calculations
We all know about you English folks... what's yours is yours and what belongs to someone else is yours also.
just because they want more tv money for there own coffers
just pathetic whinging
throwing their toys out of the pram
Typical bitter Anglo/French behaviour
this boils down to financial greed
Whinge whinge moan moan - typical English
Pathetic
The English and French leagues are full of mercenaries playing for big fat greedy pay cheques
if ever there was proof of English whinging, this is surely it. whing, whinge, and more bloody whinge...
shameful bullying
the Arrogance of the these people knows no bounds
its really pathetic
trying to get there grubby little hands on every penny they can
Unbelievable arrogance
leaving them drown in the greed they so crave
the destroyers of a great game in Europe
I say sod the arrogant English
it is just arrogance
nothing more than pure greed
greedy English
Your arrogance is astounding
the English money-grubbing nation of shop-keepers
800 years of crimes against humanity
whining victimisation
Just like the English
The English are now toxic.
endless greed and disregard for the law
the centuries of crimes in your wake

Any response to my questions? If you don't want to answer, no problem. I just thought that you would seeing as this is the second time you made that point to me (i've just seen that old post in the Loose Pass story that you mentioned) so I assume you were interested enough in my response to read it. I'm just trying to see the logic behind English fans', such as yourself's, issues with the Pro12. They don't seem logical to me and when I point out flaws in your arguments in response to your comments, which just seem a little too obvious, I have yet to get a response or get answers to questions I ask.
If your arguments are so convincing, why is there such a lack of response to the questions or pointing out of what seem to be obvious flaws in the logic of your arguments?

Hahahah! AWESOME!!!!! Northern Hemisphere rugby is the winner, almost! There's a risk that Italy will get sold down the river by a compromise that allows say 8 pro 12 teams to qualify. which is plain selfish but it will ensure celtic stars get the rest all rugby players need to stay fit and in form.
Personally, I think the PRO12 are in a great position. They have a strong argument for resting players and so should stick to their guns and the onus should be on england and france to pull themselves up to the benchmark set by the likes of Leinster, Ulster and Munster. We should be improving the rugby, thats the primary goal that every rugby fans wants. England and France focus on the business side to the detriment of the rugby so the balance is blatently wrong. This whole eurocup PRL farce has been a public relations disarster for the english clubs. I'm English and I've just got utter contempt for them. Heads should roll. They want to act like businessmen then resign and take the consequenses of their incompetence like businessmen. How is this different to the incompetance shown by the RFU last year? Its not. PRL have messed up big time and their reputation is in tatters.

@crunchfit: You say "...resting players for a single game where they know they can't make the play-offs, for a much bigger game, in a bigger tournament means that teams in the Pro12 in general, not specifically Edinburgh, don't try?...."
I think everyone can agree that simply because Edinburgh rested players, it doesn't follow that all Pro12 sides rest players, and/or don't care. Maybe some do. But not all. Fair point.
What I find interesting is that you define the HCup as "a much bigger game, in a bigger tournament". That's the point. For most French teams, the HCup is not the "bigger game". T14 is the bigger game. We rest players for HCup games. We don't care much about losing to Celtic sides. It's not a big deal to us. Because we know we could beat them, if it was a level playing field. But it's not. So we don't try.
Take a look at Biarritz last season if you need any example of how motivation and prioritisation affects the outcome of games. They knew from about mid-February they were doomed in T14. So they "focussed" on the Amlin. And they won the damn thing, beating sides like Toulon along the way!!
Imagine if all French sides could "focus" on the HCup. It would at least make us worth beating.

So what if Edinburgh rested players and focused on the HC last season. The professional game in Scotland consists of two teams and it needs entry into a European competition in order to grow. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow are gradually improving and who knows where they will be this season, but if the rich English clubs are appeased here then the professional game in Scotland and Italy will be sunk.
This is about money and about English Clubs not winning the European Cup all the other stuff is subderfuge.

@APV1
There's a difference between resting players a week prior to the Toulouse match, and completely abandoning the Pro12 (or something to that effect), as has been suggested recently. Besides, people point to Edinburgh as an example and suggest all teams abandon the league.
So, people on your side of the argument think that resting players for a single game where they know they can't make the play-offs, for a much bigger game, in a bigger tournament means that teams in the Pro12 in general, not specifically Edinburgh, don't try? And you think that that demeans and devalues the competition? That doesn't really make sense to me. Sorry. If you're in two competitions, your fate is sealed in one, and you have a chance to win in the other, clearly you prioritise the latter. And prioritise is a bit of an exaggeration. It was really just resting players for a single game, not prioritising.

Cheers, porridge!
APV, I'd actually agree with all of that. I sent in a query at the end of the season to a rugby program that airs in Ireland precisely on that topic. What Edinburgh did wasn't respectable, but they exploited the system. It's certainly part of the reason why we're having this debate now. (However I do see a fair bit of jealousy at the successes of the provinces as being the larger part of this being brought up)
My suggested solution was to keep the 10 berths (to which I feel we're entitled as a European league representing 4 Unions, rather than a domestic league representing one- the two simply do not equate), but do away with automatic qualification for the Scots and Italians. All of the lower teams in the league are well capable of qualifying on merit, perhaps with the exception of Zebre, who have disappointed so far. It'd be fairer on 1/2-funded Connacht, and to also to degree on the fully-funded Dragons. Treviso deserve their European Cup place- they're no push over, and have taken a few scalps. Even Aironi managed that. But if you pluck Zebre now in the pool stages it throws the whole Cup out of whack. Far better to have a superior team there on merit, and allow Zebre time to grow in the Challenge. Plus the lower end of the league becomes far more competitive. And there would be no more taking the peas like Edinburgh did last year.

@ Sincero - as I posted on the Loose Pass thread and on other HC threads, Edinburgh, imo, had little respect for the Pro12 and decided to rest players:
That's why people are suggesting that some teams don't try. Because they prioritise. I understand why, I just don't like it and think it demeans and devalues the competition.
And, as a Bath fan, I too was disppointed with the result and (especially) the performance at the Rec (just see my comments). We have the talent, especially in the back 3, to play some fantastic rugby. Bendy's try proved that. But we're lacking a play-maker at 10 and Barkley's filling in. He's an ok 10, but not a Beaver (with his experience and rugby-vision) or a Heathcote (with his youthful flair and exuberance).
@ 7ton - as you say, teams will always miss out unless every team plays every other team. But that's where the Amlin comes in. I think we're trying to get to a sensible place and I hope that the Unions, ERC, PRL, etc can get there too.
My personal two bug-bears are automatic qualification for teams, regardless of their standard (e.g. Zebre) and teams which are almost encouraged to "do an Edinburgh". And, as I see it, that's what most French and English fans object to as well. A pan-Eropean salary cap wouldn't go amiss either, but I think that's a bit of a pipe dream, along with foreign player restrictions being unified.

Giving consideration to your suggestion that the top 6 teams from each league go into the HC it may well be that the 7th finisher in the Rabo could be on many occasions better than the 6th finishers in the AP or T14.
Now that goes completely against your your view that the HC should be for the best teams in Europe only regardless whether all 6n countries are included or not.
Who can ever say that all the top finishers in the AP or T14 are going to be better than the 7th or even 8th finisher of the Rabo? Even as the format is now an Irish or Welsh team missing out may claim they are better than the 6th placed AP/T14 team.
The only way we could have it by your principle is if every team in Europe were to all play each other home and away.
For obvious time and other factors this would not be possible unless we just have one big European league and forget the rest.
In regards to making the Rabo more competitive one possibility may be to reduce the amount of Rabo teams that qualify from 10 to 8 or even 7 then have 1 team each from Italy and Scotland and 2 or even just 1 each from Ireland and Wales that have a guaranteed place and then let the rest fight it out.
To make up the full HC numbers bring in more from the Amlin and/or include the runner up from the previous years HC.
Another idea could be to reduce the amount of Auto qualifiers from the AP/T14 as well and have some sort of play off between the "just losers" of all 3 leagues but time may be a factor.
There are many possibilities and I just hope that the powers that be can get there heads together and have a reasoned debate which does take into consideration the greater good of rugby

And what the bugger makes you think teams are hardly trying in the Pro 12? That's really very presumptuous of you, and also very much not the case. I watched Ulster host Munster at Ravenhill last weekend, and also watched Saints visit the Rec. I had a little combination bet on, you see? Now, without many of the internationals back, the pace, execution, the power and the passion of the game that was on show in Belfast would completely eclipse anything you have on show in England. Utter dross at the Rec. And then Leicester - Sarries the other day? The big teams? This is the mad thing- instead of thinking about why you can't produce rugby of any decent standard you immediately try to hamstring duplicitously your neighbours in an attempt to drag the game back to your level. It's really quite abhorrent.
We've got our own problems with the game in Italy, Scotland and Wales, and your solution is to make the first two extinct and the last endangered? Instead of trying to murder the sport until nobody else is left, as per your tradition, why not give rugby up altogether and concentrate on something you love doing that nobody else can be bothered with?
Enter a 'boring conversations about weather international championship', or a 'treating animals as if the are people cup'... or a 'general knowledge quiz on the Duchess of Cambridge's knickers'... something you're guaranteed to win as a nation. And leave the rugby alone, folks. Better for everyone.

'Leinster finishing in the top six is irrelevant when the teams they're playing against are hardly trying. That is one of the many points you seem unable to grasp. You are as diplomatic and intelligent as the people running the premiership!'
I'm not trying to be diplomatic, mate. And clearly neither are you lot. What led you to call me unintelligent. A little ad hominem, no? I'm not trying to insult anyone, pal. I'm fairly confident in my level of intelligence too, so not offended, just puzzled. I'm not slagging you off. I specifically said I like your fans. It's just this kind of carry-on makes you... less popular, shall we say?
'@ Sincero - therein lies the problem. When we were invited back in and offered a cup of tea, it was rubbish. It wasn't brewed correctly. The milk went in the cup first (an absolute No! No!). There was no lemon as an alternative. The list goes on.'
Honestly wouldn't be surprised if it contained more saliva than tea after all that, though. So you're saying you think you should have seen a far higher % of the Sky money, or are you just extending the analogy?
I must say, in the past you used to kick off after any success, but this time that's not the case. Your national team is trousers, your clubs can't hold their own at all, and your brand of rugby could be sold in D.I.Y. shops as a paint drying aid. Your position is laughably weak.
So what now? A 'PREMIER EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WORLD AND UNIVERSE CUP' with teams just from England? I'll pay you 20 quid in advance now not to bother boring me with the details of who wins it.

Swimming improves vascular function, BP in older adults
HealthDay News -- Regular swimming improved blood pressure (BP) and vascular function in older adults with early hypertension, study data indicate.
"Swimming exercise elicits hypotensive effects and improvements in vascular function in previously sedentary older adults," Nantinee Nualim, PhD, of the University of Texas in Austin, and colleagues reported in the April 1 issue of the American Journal of Cardiology.
Swimming is thought to be an ideal exercise for older adults due to the minimal weight-bearing stress and decreased heat load associated with the activity. But little data is available on potential vascular risks.

Notes to Kant's Account of Reason
1. We might also note Kant's view of logical reasoning. In the Introduction to the Transcendental Dialectic, Kant distinguishes “logical” from “real” or “pure” uses of reason. The logical use of reason represents a “subordinate faculty” (A305/B362) of drawing inferences (syllogisms), and Kant says relatively little about it in the Critique. It is the “pure” use, whereby reason “itself contains the origin of certain concepts and principles” (A299/B355), that demands critique: hence, of course, the book's title. For extended discussion of this distinction, see Patrone 2008: Ch. 3.
2. This neglect is perhaps less surprising if we recall Kant's very disparaging remarks about attempts to answer the general question, “What is truth?” at B82/A58ff.
3. Cf. O'Neill 1984, which draws on Jean Piaget's studies of young children's knowledge of the world. When asked whether the number of beads will stay the same when they are spread out over a longer distance, for instance, children below a certain age will assume that the number of beads has increased. As O'Neill says, it is difficult to say just what the child believes in this case; in Kant's terms, his or her beliefs do not meet the formal conditions of truth.
4. Cf. also Kant's discussion in the Prolegomena: “The difference between truth and dream… is not decided through the quality of the representations that are referred to objects, for they are the same in both, but through their connection according to rules that determine the combination of representations in the concept of an object, and how far they can or cannot stand together in one experience.” (4:290)
5. It is easy to miss the role that others' judgments play when reading the first Critique, since Kant's concern is largely with the transcendental conditions of experience in general, and hence with an individual knower. However, as Gelfert 2006 has persuasively argued, testimony (and hence communication: cf sections 3.2 and 3.3 of the main entry) are fundamental to Kant's analysis of knowledge among actual human beings. For example, Kant's lectures on logic refer to 'the criterion of truth: to compare one's opinions with those of other people... The principle of indifference etc. to the judgments of others in comparison with my own is [by contrast] the principle of logical egoism' (24.2:740, as quoted/translated by Gelfert 2006: 644). See also Mikalsen 2010 for a recent application of these insights.
6. Cf. “the systematic unity of the understanding's cognitions… is the touchstone of truth of rules” (A647/B675); “it can never be permitted to ascribe such a faculty [i.e., freedom] to substances in the world itself, because then the connection of appearances necessarily determining one another in accordance with universal laws, which one calls nature, and with it the mark of empirical truth, which distinguishes experience from dreaming, would largely disappear” (A451/B479); “What is connected with a perception according to empirical laws, is actual” (A376). Cf. Bxli, A492/B520f.
7. Genesis, ch. 11—the literal meaning of “Babel” being “confusion.”
8. O'Neill 1989: Ch. 1 especially emphasises this passage, as well as the epigraph that Kant added to the second edition of the Critique from Francis Bacon's Great Instauration. Bacon deploys the same imagery of making trial, secure founding, planning, construction, modesty and limits that Kant now uses.
9. Kant often uses the disparaging verb “vernünfteln,” akin to “rationalise” (Vernunft being the German word for reason).
10. Cf. Kant's comment in the Prolegomena: “High towers and the metaphysically-great men who resemble them, around both of which there is usually so much wind, are not for me.” (4:373n)
11. Kant states this very clearly in “What Does it Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking?”: “if reason will not subject itself to the laws it gives itself, it has to bow under the yoke of laws given by another; for without any law, nothing—not even nonsense—can play its game for long” (8:145).
12. “But who would even want to introduce a new principle of morality and, as it were, first invent it? Just as if, before him, the world had been ignorant of what duty is or in thoroughgoing error about it.” (Critique of Practical Reason, 5:8n)
13. Kant was already clear about this in the so-called “Prize essay,” an “Inquiry concerning the distinctness of the principles of natural theology and morality” (1764). He expands on the point in the first Critique's Doctrine of Method, in the section entitled, “The Discipline of Pure Reason”; cf. Bx ff.
14. Thus a number of writers have stressed the more modest, defensive idea of vindication at work in Kant: not a positive proof that permits no doubt, but a defence that address the specific worries of specific audiences. Cf. Ameriks 2003, or this passage from Łuków (1993, 221): “It is neither sufficient nor possible to prove law and freedom, but it is sufficient and possible to defend them by identifying the practical constraint which testifies to their instantiation in actual lives.”
15. Passages at A310/B358 and A316/B373 are very close to the central principle of legal order explored in the Doctrine of Right, the first part of the Metaphysics of Morals—but this is not yet the underlying idea of the Categorical Imperative.
16. Please see the note at the beginning of the bibliography for an explanation of these references to Kant's moral writings.
17. We might add a third reason. We also have an interest in the unity of philosophy, that might be frustrated if practical and theoretical reason did not stand in a definite hierarchy. Cf. Guyer 1989.
18. Of these ideas, we have already seen the special status of freedom in Kant's system (just as it had a somewhat anomalous position within the “Antinomies” of the first Critique). In fact, the postulates only appear after Kant thinks he has demonstrated the practical reality of freedom, which is known to us by the second Critique's famous (and, as we have seen, nearly as controversial) “fact of reason.”
19. Kant is not totally pessimistic about the results of good action—in his Lectures on Ethics, he comments, “if only all men together were unanimously willing to promote their happiness, we might make a paradise of Novaya Zemlya” (Collins, 27:285f). Novaya Zemlya is a Russian arctic archipelago—ironically enough, one later used as a nuclear test site. (My thanks to Jens Timmermann for this reference and information.)
20. A terminological note: Kant sometimes also refers to this as the highest “derived” good, as compared with God's existence as the highest “original” or “independent” good—5:125, 132; “What Does it Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking?” 8:139.
21. One might also cite the fact that Kant links autonomy not only to practical but also theoretical reason: “the power to judge autonomously—that is, freely (according to principles of thought in general)—is called reason.” (Conflict of the Faculties, 7:27)
22. But the maxims are formulated much earlier, before the publication of the first Critique: see the unpublished notes R1486, 15:715f (1775-77) and R1508, 15:820, 822 (1780-84); they also appear in the Lectures on Logic, 9:57, as “general rules and conditions for avoiding error.”
23. Kant's words repay close reading: To think for oneself “is the maxim of reason that is never passive. The tendency [to passivity], hence to heteronomy of reason, is called prejudice; and the greatest prejudice of all is representing reason as if it were not subject to the rules of nature, i.e. superstition. Liberation from superstition is called enlightenment, since, although this term is also applied to liberation from prejudices in general, it is superstition above all… that deserves to be called a prejudice, since the blindness to which superstition leads… is what makes most evident the need to be led by others, hence the condition of a passive reason.” (5:294f)
24. “What Does it Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking?” 8:144. Cf.: “…if this freedom [of the pen] is denied, we are deprived at the same time of a great means of testing the correctness of our own judgments, and we are exposed to error” (Anthropology, 7:129). Universal communicability is also central to Kant's account of aesthetic judgment, following his discussion of the three maxims in the third Critique (5:295-7).
25. For a rather different, but perhaps complementary, attempt to reconstruct key Kantian insights about reason, while preserving aspects of the instrumental and communitarian approaches, see Robert Brandom 2001 and 2002: Ch. 1.

Remained committed to ECU after meeting head coach Ruffin McNeill for the first time immediately after his hire, but missed the start of the academic semester (which prevented participation in spring drills) ... Loyalty to the Pirate program was evidenced by self-funded move to Greenville and attendance at all 15 spring workouts to absorb as much knowledge as possible about new offensive scheme ... Competition in Atlantic Coast Conference wars while at Boston College brought a much-needed battle-tested, big-game mindset to a program which had lost a six-year signal-caller the previous season ... Vision, mobility, quickness, passing touch, poise, mental preparation and competitive instincts have all been lauded by coaching staff, but work ethic and leadership skills are most respected by teammates who voted him to serve as team captain on 10 of 13 occasions last season ... Enjoyed a productive spring, fine-tuning his responsibilities in the spread scheme ... Completed 13-of-18 passes for 131 yards and two touchdowns during the first scrimmage April 2 ... Found Danny Webster (five yards) and Justin Jones (13) with scoring tosses in the opener, before hooking up with Dayon Arrington on a 17-yarder in the second contest on the way to a 10-of-16, 120-yard effort April 9 ... Finished drills with limited action in the Purple-Gold Game April 16, completing all four attempts for 29 yards and a touchdown - a three-yard throw to Joe Womack to open the scoring ... A 2011 Preseason All- Conference selection (fourth-team) by Phil Steele Magazine ... Labeled as the "6th-best NFL talent" in C-USA and "Coolest In The Clutch" by Lindy's Magazine.

Derek Moye
Penn State

WR/RT
Derek Moye already has established himself as one of the elite wideouts in Penn State's glorious gridiron history, but the former Rochester High School all-state star and state champion sprinter is poised for an even bigger season in the fall. A probable All-America candidate, Moye is coming off a superb junior season that saw him lead the Nittany Lions with 53 receptions for 885 yards and eight touchdowns. A Phil Steele's College Football Preview preseason first-team All-Big Ten selection, he hauled in a touchdown in seven of the last eight games, including the final five contests. Moye brings outstanding size, skills and speed to the offense. The crisp route runner and prolific leaper is a big-play threat on every snap. He was second in the Big Ten with a 16.7 yards per catch average, was fifth in the conference in receiving yardage (68.1 ypg) and tied for ninth in receptions last year. Moye also moved among the Penn State career leaders with 104 receptions (11th), 1,741 receiving yards (11th) and 15 touchdown receptions (5th tie). He needs 22 receptions and 266 yards to move into the Top 5 on both lists. A 2010 honorable-mention All-Big Ten selection, Moye's hard work in the off-season has him prepared for a huge senior season. He already has established himself as a player with the talent and toughness to be a game-changer.

UW This Season: The Cowboys will look to Tashaun Gipson to be a leader in the secondary during the 2011 campaign, after the departure of seniors Marcell Gipson, his older brother, and Chris Prosinski. With a team-high 37 consecutive starts under his belt, Gipson has led Wyoming in pass breakups and interceptions as a cornerback the last two seasons, and is a candidate for postseason honors as a senior this fall. 2010: Gipson continued to be one of UW's top defensive backs in his junior campaign, as he started all 12 games and earned Honorable Mention All-Mountain West honors from MW coaches and media. He finished the season with 40 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss, nine pass breakups and three interceptions. His average of 1.0 passes defended per game tied for second in the league and No. 26 nationally, while his three interceptions ranked fourth in the MWC and tied for No. 87 in the NCAA. Gipson notched 77 interception return yards on the season with returns of 32 against Utah, 26 against Colorado State and 19 against San Diego State. He recorded a season-high six tackles at BYU and had five against Colorado State. 2009: Gipson intercepted three passes his sophomore season to tie for the team lead and tie for 10th in the Mountain West Conference. In addition to his three interceptions, he recorded six pass breakups for a total of nine passes defended, which led the team and tied him for No. 9 in the MWC. Two of his interceptions came against UNLV, tying him for the NCAA's 11th best single-game interception total for the `09 season. Gipson's other interception came in the season opener versus Weber State. His top single-game tackle performances of the year came on the road at Colorado (10 tackles, one forced fumble), at San Diego State (nine tackles) and in the New Mexico Bowl vs. Fresno State (seven tackles). 2008: The younger Gipson excelled in the starting lineup, ranking sixth on the team in tackles, with 56, and tying with his brother Marcell for the team lead in pass breakups, with 10. Gipson began the season in strong fashion, recording a season high nine tackles in a season-opening win over Ohio. He also had seven tackles on two occasions -- versus Air Force and at UNLV. Gipson also broke up three passes against UNLV. His other top performance of 2008 came at BYU, where he recorded six tackles, broke up three passes and forced one fumble.

Mobile wallets are around the corner - can we trust RFID?
Audio: Our debit card could soon go the way of the chequebook and become a relic in terms of how we make purchases. RFID (radio-frequency identification technology) will allow us to tap and swipe our way to simple transactions - but is it secure?

We’re headed to the airport! Our morning began somberly at the Holocaust Museum, but the kids learned about what life was like in Nazi Germany and the importance of re-telling this story to future generations. Our last stop was the Lincoln Memorial. The kids were challenged to find the mistake! Once they found it, they showed their friends. Now we’re on our way to the airport and headed home! We’ll be back around 5:45 (CST). See you soon!

Girl sees plant blooming in nursery and is amazed. Girl wants hibiscus. Years pass.
Girl buys hardy hibiscus. For a lot of money. And is thrilled with late summer blooms.
Girl doesn't have the perfectly-drained and sunny spot for said bush so she leaves it in the pot for the winter. (Because hardy hibiscus can survive minus 30F.)
The winter is endless and cold. Very cold.
Girl is dismayed at dead-looking stems in the spring. (What was she thinking?!)
Girl hopes for a miraculous rejuvenation. Nothing happens.
Girl begins to rehearse her story to get a replacement plant at her local nursery which only has a six-month replacement policy.
Girl notices that the neighborhood roses-of-sharon are also dead-looking in spring. Maybe there's hope.
Stems begin sprouting new growth. (June 9th? Miracles do happen.)
Hibiscus gets a haircut.
Inspired and relieved, girl digs up wisteria that hasn't bloomed since the fence fell on it years ago and puts in hardy hibiscus instead. Plant grows and flourishes. Buds form. Buds show color. Waiting is hard!
First hibiscus blossom on August 27th. Smaller than a dinner plate, much larger than a salad plate. Girl shares her delight with family, neighbors, passing strangers who all
Kharma investigates huge flower as possible alien invasion.
"It's safe, Mom."
"It's safe, Mom."
August 29th. For some, this is memorable as the first day of school. Girl will always remember this side-by-side set of incredibly large blooms at the end of summer.
Love the two-toned swirl and the bright green leaves. Amazed at how many blossoms it has. She's a winner!
Giddily,
This was the nicest of happy endings. And I'm happy to share at a very special party for all us gardeners: an end of the season gathering of favorites over at An Oregon Cottage.

cotangent inverse gives the angle of the cotangent with the contangent's value as its domain. use that and you can just draw a triangle and get A/H.
I am still confused, not considering cosine yet, the problem is basically cot (x) = 3/4, right? Im not quite sure for exactly cotangents work, but the only solutions I know for tangent are fractions on the basic unit circle (1, (sqrt(3)/2)/(1/2), the opposite of that, and 0). Please forgive me if I completely off, I haven't taken trig anything in over 2 years which is part of my problem.
it's asking for the cosine of the angle that makes cotangent 3/4. cotangent = A/O = 3/4.?

The Ranger School is a location whereby individuals aspire to become either Rangers, Mechanics and Operators in training, featured in Shadows of Almia. Hidden in Ascension Square is a diary which was used by the three founding fathers of the Ranger Union: Erma, Professor Hastings and Lamont.
OverviewEdit
At the Ranger School, individuals are taught skills pertaining to the lives of Pokémon Rangers, in order to succeed as either a Ranger, a Mechanic or an Operator. It is here where Erma, Professor Hastings and Lamont vowed to bring peace to the Pokémon world, thus forging what would later become the institution of the Ranger Union. Lamont created the Ranger School to allow children to learn about the responsibilities of being a Pokémon Ranger. For demonstration purposes, the Ranger School implements a safer, less powerful variant of the Capture Styler called the School Styler.
- Pokémon Ranger - A Pokémon Ranger's role is to uphold the peace within the Almia region and protect nature. Their role is pivotal in the day-to-day running of the Ranger Union.
- Operator - These people are assigned to communicate directly with Pokémon Rangers in the field via voicemail, and can grant additional PokéAssists to Rangers who successfully complete a mission. Though the role of Operator is slightly subservient to the Ranger, it is a crucial aspect of the Ranger Union.
- Mechanic - The Mechanic's role in the series is to repair machinery. Not much else about this class is known.
TeachersEdit
Within the Ranger School, there are a variety of teachers whom are capable of teaching students about the role of Pokémon Rangers in everyday life. The teachers present are as follows:
- Mr. Lamont - The Headmaster of the Ranger School and its founder, Lamont is a person dedicated to the ideals of peace within the world.
- Mr. Kincaid - Kincaid is a teacher at the Ranger School, who later reveals himself as a member of the sinister Team Dim Sun.
- Ms. April - April is the teacher of the protagonist's classroom.
- Ms. Claire - Claire is a teacher at the Ranger School, whose specialty lies in Target Clear.
- Janice - Janice serves as the person who looks after the Ranger School.
- Mr. Kaplan - Kaplan is a teacher at the Ranger School, who specialises in the teaching of Capturing Pokémon through the use of School Stylers.
LocationsEdit
FieldEdit
This place is located in front of the Ranger School building. There are crates here, and some Pokémon roaming around the field. There is a classroom on the left side of the building. To the right is where Ascension Square is located.
HallwayEdit
Located in the first floor of the Ranger School, with two classrooms, a library, staircase and the Staff Room. Pichu and Bidoof are found here.
Second FloorEdit
This is the place to eat and where dormitories are located.
Ascension SquareEdit
This is where the Pledge Stone is located. There is a port on the east side. This is where Team Dim Sun's Cargo Ship will eventually crash here.
BasementEdit
This is where Mr. Kincaid's laboratory located. The location also has a Zubat blocking it so the player must find his/her own way.
EntranceEdit
It is found in front of the Field, to the west, it leads to School Road.

"I don't know who made it," Greene told CNN.
But that doesn't mean he isn't listening.
"It sounds good," he said. "Make sure everybody hears it."
It appears the video was created by a San Francisco hip-hop producer calling himself "Satellite High" and uploaded to YouTube by a user called "virgiltexas."
Both men promoted the video on their Twitter feeds yesterday, with Satellite High proclaiming: "when i say 'alvin' you say 'dammit you people will believe anything.'"
The producer did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
UPDATE: Jay Friedman, the San Francisco-based producer behind the song, is amused at the attention the video has gotten. The entire concept, he said, was developed among a group of friends "goofing off" on Twitter who had been following the Alvin Greene phenomenon.
"I just like making funny music, and a friend of mine on Twitter approached me asking, 'You wanna do this'," Friedman said in phone conversation. "It was kind of inside jokey thing."
Friedman said the song took about an hour to complete, with some extra time needed to convince his wife to perform back-up vocals. The video, which was posted on YouTube Thursday, was produced by his friend.
He said he was taken aback when the video was billed as an "official" Greene campaign video.
"When we were making it, we were trying to make sure there was enough comedy and parody in it so that people would be sure that it didnt come from the Alvin Greene campaign," Friedman said. "People are willing to believe very strange things when they come from the internet."
It would be really funny if, after putting this D stooge in place, the R opponent loses.
Nothing personal against Mr Greene, don't know much about the man
What I have seen of him, has suggested that this man currently has no qualifications to in the US Senate
Now the conspiracy theorist that suggest he might be a Republican funded plant, could scarily be correct. They go on to laugh at the Republicans for such an underhanded trick, as well laugh at the possibility that Demint is so corrupt, that Mr Greene might actually become the next Senator of S.C.
Don't laugh too hard people, if your theories are correct, and a Democrat beats the Republican in S.C., who do you think Mr Greene is going to be loyal to
If your theories are correct, what I see, is that the joke might just be on you ... two Republicans are running for the same seat
Mr Greene might simply end up being a Republican in Democratic clothing ... sounds like the Democrats lose no matter what
He will fit right in in Washington. His credentials will stand with the rest.
Can anyone get this so called "Greene"out of the site. Remember out of the site out of the mind. He is just there and pretending he is something while he is not. No one knew Greene before, now he is talking while not showing that he is something. Please stop playing with peoples mind. We have more pressing issue to deal with than wasting our precious time in this empty suit Greene from no where! Even the bridge to no where, was known it was in Alaska!
Why not vote for Alvin Greene??? He is as intelligent as any Gov. S.C. has ever had....I'd bet a whole lot more honest!!!
The democrats must be so proud of their candidate....
This guy is the most decent, honest Democrat to run for office in the last 40 years. It is no wonder that the libs are attacking him, he isn't enough of a hater for the Democrat hate party.
We need, at least, 50 % of people like Alvin Greene in US Congress. People who have struggled to pay rent, to pay telephone bill, to pay electrical bill, to go to restaurant, and so on.
People who could afford vacation, to pay their credit card bill on time, or to have a decent car.
For American people, it is more important than a good speech
Therefore, Mr. Alvin Greene has my vote and my money.
Also. I am not sure what people mean when they say that he is an idiot. How many people, in this country, with Mr. Alvin Greene conditions could manage to be a US Senator nominee in South Carolina? An idiot could not do it. I am not an idiot, bu I couldn't.. So, somewhere, he is very smart.
Please, South Caroline, don't put this dumb in Senate.
Turning Alvin Greene into a rappin candidate in South Carolina will virtually hand the election to Jim DeMint.
All you liberal political thugs out there have been
slamming this guy from the get go.
I ,on the other hand, have defended his right as a
winner of a free election. Of course you libs don't
believe in free elections (Bush-Gore, Bush-Kerry).
But back to the subject, this guy Greene is the brightest
star I've seen in the democratic camp in a few years.
I'll predict he will be a very popular representative and
alot of talk show hosts will be eating crow.
Mr. Greene should smile more. He has earned the right o smile. He has the Democrats scratching heir heads in dismay. I haven't heard anything about the "probe" into his primary election. If there was something found it wold have made the news. So Good Luck Mr. Greene.
Heaven help us.
This guy is a perfect example of a Democrat...
The fine DNC should be overwhelmed with Pride!
Good luck Sir... fantastic job in the primary... we are all behind you
South Carolina is so screwed! A lying corporate apologist or gumby. Is this the best that the State can come up with? Pathetic.
Mr. Greene will get my vote. He's better then DeMint.
Has anyone ever figured out how Mr. Green came to win the primary in South Carolina? While he seems like a very pleasant and easy-going man, he doesn't strike me as someone prepared for this important position. Who was he running against? This story seems to have died in the media. In any event if his primary win is legitimate, I wish him all the luck in the world. He will need every ounce of it.

President Obama IS a Constituional scholar. I wonder what made the newly elected Teatards think they could challenge the constitutionality of Healthcare Reform when one of their very own felt that familiarity with the Constitution was an UNNECESSARY prerequisite for a Senator?
Did they also think that the insertion of a Latina,and a gay Supreme Court Justice was just a "checkers" move on the President's part?
As long as taxpayers are expected to pay for treatment for people who have no health insurance, we should be able to require everyone who is capable of purchasing health insurance to do so – just like uninsured motorist insurance! Of course, Tim Pawlenty's solution is for emergency rooms to turn patients away who cannot pay and have no insurance. That's the GOP health care plan and I suppose that's the "Death Panel" that they spoke of – just send them away to die in the street. Until then, taxpayers shouldn't have to pick up the tab for those who can afford health insurance but simply won't pay for it.
President Obama IS a Constituional scholar.
================================================
HAhAHAHA!!!! RIGHT! And he thinks it is outdated and irrelevant, just as all Progressives think. The American people told him otherwise on Nov. 2nd. He's just too stupid to realize it. Amazing how arrogance and elitism blinds people to reality.
This law will be ruled unconstitutional in 2011 or 2012 by a 5-4 vote. Get over it libtards.
Mama, part of the solution is also making people work and give up watching Oprah. Here is the real deal, we are already paying for these people through the innumeralble entitlement programs that a fraught with waste and corruption and a lot of the cost is the liberal trial lawyer suing that Obama has refused to control. He also refused to allow the companies to sell across state lines and took out the doc tax, so it wasn't included in the original cost and could be added later. So as far as the eye can see we are paying for the failure of the NEA to educate our children because they want more Viagra, the greedy trial lawyers and the millions of drug using, Oprah watchers who don't want to work. So what does this do for me except raise my premiums which your president promised it would not do.
So much for the tea bag agenda. All they have left is the goofy impeachment strategy.
To the Nancy Pelosi hater: It is the republicans who want to remove those constitutional amendments that are not pro white. Arrogance is a multi millionaire like Mitch McConnell thinking he is speaking for main stream America. That also goes for the town drunk who will become speaker of the house in January.
Why do we even need health insurance companies? Seems to me that they're just greedy middlemen who add nothing to the delivery of healthcare besides another level of burocracy. The more claims they deny, the more profit they make. They are the real death panels. If we had universal healthcare like the rest of the world, all of this would be a "mute" point. (I know it's moot, but ya gotta write so the teabaggers little pea brains can understand.) Have a nice day!
To the guy laughing about the President being a constitutional scholar:
I'm a progressive, and I believe firmly in the Constitution. All of it; not just the parts the teabaggers like. I believe in the separation of church and state. I believe in the 14th Amendment, too. What gave you the idea that progressives don't believe in the Constitution?
As for the President being stupid, I'd like to see your degree from Harvard, or anywhere, for that matter. No, I don't mean your GED. I'll be glad to show you my Associate, Bachelors, and Masters. If you think progressives are lazy, I'll be glad to show you my job history for the past 45 years, including 3 1/2 years in the regular army during Vietnam. Your insults only show your ignorance, which is the lesson we all learned about teabaggers during this last election cycle.
For a good close up look at arrogance, try a mirror.
Nancy Pelosi, the wicked witch of the west, the DemocRAT gift that just keeps on giving
President Obama IS a Constituional scholar.
================================================
HAhAHAHA!!!! RIGHT! And he thinks it is outdated and irrelevant,
-------------------------------------------------–
EXACTLY what has he done to violate the Constitution that would make you say that? Let me answer that for you: NOTHING. Your boys in Congress would've been ALL OVER THAT if he was in fact violating our sacred Constitution. Perhaps if you'd studied a little harder in school you wouldn't feel so threatened by intelligence.
The RepubliCAN'Ts knew this – they just want to MAKE SOME NOISE!!! Everyone who voted for them because they thought the Health Care Reform was going to be repealed – WASTED A VOTE!!!
There is a LOT more the RepubliCAN'Ts ARE NOT going to get – like those TAX CUTS for the RICH – the middle class will prevail in that too – RAISE the THRESHOLD – END TAX CUTS for those making over that threshold!!! Yes We Can!!
The RepubliCAN'Ts put a lot of fear in voters and it will all surface over the next couple of days, months and years and most Americans are going to say – "WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED"?!
President Obama – and I agree with Dominican Mama – is a very intelligent man and this is what make those people that live in those 'small pockets of America' ANGRY!
This is T'sah – OUT of Campaign – N2 MOVING AMERICAN FORWARD with all of the Reforms THIS President achieved – President Barack Obama!!!
Obama is a constitutional scholar and Bush graduated from Yale. I will judge them more by the destruction they have or are wreaking on our country. And the lies they told or are telling.
Are we done with the DemoPublicanRebOcrats yet?
I wonder how the rethugs are going to tell people who are already being helped by the healthcare reform bill that, oops, we don't like it but because we have health insurance and we have a lot of money that doesn't mean we want YOU to have it. At least the insurance part. RETHUGS ARE THE DEATH PANELS!!
Typical republikan hypocritical system.
I don't care what SCOTUS "normally" does. This is a gross deriliction of their sworn duties. Requiring any amoerican to purchase any product where there is no alternative behaviour is not in the spirit of Constitution, is not enumrated in the powers of Congress or the Executive for any reason in the Constitution. For the sake of our country this needs to be resolved as quickly as possible. Requiring Auto Insurance isn't the same thing–we can all choose to walk or ride a horse.
The constitution is a lot like the bible. Open to all sorts of interpretation. Couldn't one argue that promoting the general welfare, as they say, could include requiring everyone to have health insurance so that we all don't wind up paying for all of the emergency room visits by the uninsured? Have a nice day!
@
keepstufingthis
Mama, part of the solution is also making people work and give up watching Oprah.
-------------------------------------------------–
I agree. Yet you'd have to also agree that as it stands (or stood) we (those of us that work for a living and have health insurance) had been paying all along through fees and higher premiums for those without insurance.
Why would you want Obama, YOUR PRESIDENT TOO, to curb lawyers suing anybody? Isn't that an infringement on free American enterprise? Lawyers sue. That's what they do.
And what the hell was that you said about the NEA not educating kids because they want more Viagra?!?
You're rambling babe.
I agree with you about getting people back to work and away from their meth labs on college campuses, and in the heartland of America. The influx of this drug primarily produced by White America is killing off the youth we have left.
I agree with Dennis, the liability auto insurance requirement is completely different.
Take a look at what the CBO says. Recent report shows that Prescription cost have already begun to climb. This is just the beginning. As base costs go up, insurance costs will have to follow, or there won't be an insurance industry, maybe this was the engame they had in mind anyway.

Jackson, 47, checked out of the Mayo Clinic for the first time in early September, his office said, and the clinic had acknowledged Jackson was a patient in an August statement.
He is the subject of several investigations, including.
In an October recorded automated call made to constituents in October,."
Rev. Jesse Jackson, his father and a well-known civil rights leader, made no comment when contacted by CNN.
– CNN's Miriam Falco, Sean Nottingham, Deirdre Walsh, and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report
Since he is a Democrat if there is any other issues he needs to be checked so he can do absolutely nothing on the government dime feel free. We used to this in the private sector and it was called a non-paying sabbatical (usually for non-profit work). If he needs mental health care he needs to step down and let the next union owned democrat take his place.
Congratulations! He won his seat. Tell him we all have to learn to control our minds for the benefit of our health.
I read Jackson is looking to cut a deal with the FBI, he resigns his position and doesn't face jail time. I think the Mayo clinic illness is more like buying time trying to figure out what to do.
I'm a democrat but in my opinion Congressman Jackson needs to resign. If he is unstable, he can't really serve the people in his district properly. Time to "Man Up".

A recent presidential poll shows former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney still has a lot of work to do to win the support of women in Virginia.
Enter Virginia’s “Women for Romney” – a newly formed group attempting to channel
Fittingly the group held an event Thursday at a women’s boutique in a newly-built shopping mall in Hanover County — the predominantly Republican Richmond suburb where Romney is scheduled to stop Saturday as part of his bus tour of swing states leading up to the GOP convention in Tampa Florida Aug. 27.
Del. Barbara Comstock, R-Fairfax, said women have lost more than 400,000 jobs since Barack Obama became president.
“Obama isn’t working, and we need to make a change,’ she told a group of roughly two dozen women gathered at the Ruby Slipper Boutique. Roughly half of the attendees had some direct connection to the Hanover Republican Party or the campaigns of Romney and GOP U.S. Senate candidate George Allen, or Rep. Eric Cantor, R-7th.
The group also heard from Jean Ann Bolling, wife of Lt. Gov. Bill Bollling, the 2013 gubernatorial candidate and chairman of Romney’s campaign in Virginia. “Women are going to be crucial to getting Mitt Romney elected,” she said.
Right now, Republicans could use more of them. Romney trails Obama among women voters in Virginia 54-40 percent, according to a new Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll released earlier this week. Overall the president holds a 49-45 edge over Romney.
Previous polls indicate Romney fares better among white women in the commonwealth, and much of the appeal behind Thursday’s event was geared toward getting the suburban gathering to network with their friends and neighbors, make calls, and affix bumper stickers to their minivans.
“The most important network is the YOU network,” said Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who participated in the Virginia Women for Romney events, which featured an earlier stop in Charlottesville.
The Obama campaign, meanwhile, has been running ads in the commonwealth and other swing states charging that a Romney presidency would mark a step backward for women in areas like reproductive rights and contraception.
“The Obama campaign and those ads don’t speak for all Virginia women,” Jean Ann Bolling said.
One middle-aged Mechanicsville woman in the store told the gathering that she has been called a racist for not supporting the president.
She said she is not a racist and that when she is pushed on the issue, she responds by saying “I’m voting against the white half” of Obama, a reference to the president’s mother, who was white.
The public officials at the event quickly tried to talk the woman out of engaging with others along that line of political argument, calling it a distraction from the real.
Later, after being approached by reporters, and in the presence of a GOP staffer, the woman declined to give her name, saying of the remark, “I just say it as a joke.”
To Susan Allen, Romney should appeal to women for the same reason he should appeal to men – the economy.
Whether they are business CEO’s or homemakers concerned about their husband holding onto a job or their children being able to find one, the wife of the former governor and U.S. Senator said women “know that this country is not where it should be.”
“The pulse on the ground is way different because of the economy,” she said.

PollTracker (PT) aggregates and averages all reputable public polls for a wide range of presidential, congressional, gubernatorial and state-level issue contests across the United States.
PollTracker uses the LOESS “regression analysis” library to generate its averages. The LOESS analysis is a statistical formula that integrates more current data with past polls in order to point a line in the direction the numbers are heading. PT “averages” are the endpoint of that line. The regression analysis was customized and developed in consultation with Professor Franklin. Its function is to derive trends from scatterings of polls, represented by the curved lines, taking into account both the different poll numbers and their progression over time.
Polltracker uses a process we call ‘segmenting’ to allow us to present data separated by large gaps of time on the same chart. Polltracker generates a ‘regression analysis’ – the smoothed, curvy lines on the graphs – for data sets with at least 10 data points and no gaps between data points of greater than 6 weeks. Gaps in the data of greater than six weeks are represented by a dotted line. Sets of continuous data with fewer than ten data points are calculated with a weighted mean average and represented by straight lines.

I’ve been working overtime like Diana Ross to get you reviews on the hottest albums out. Head on over to Popdose to see how I feel about two of this week’s major releases?
I have given the Black Eyed Peas a lot of grief, but it’s not as though I’m the type of person that would completely close his mind to appreciating anything they put out. Actually, I saw them in concert earlier this year and I came away having enjoyed the energy and spectacle of it all, if not the music. So I listened to “The Beginning” with as open a mind as I could muster. It didn’t help.
Meanwhile, I was practically salivating to get my hands on El DeBarge’s “Second Chance”. If I was to make a list of great underappreciated soul vocalists, El would chart pretty high. Come to think of it, maybe I should make a list like that. Anyway, I don’t know if anything is worth a 16-year wait (except maybe losing your virginity), but El’s album should definitely find a way into your collection.

Amsterdam-based design office Rietveld Landscape has launched their latest project called Bunker 599 + 603. The project lays bare two secrets of the New Dutch Waterline (NDW), a military line of defense in use from 1815 until 1940 (precisely the period without any war in The Netherlands) protecting the cities of Muiden, Utrecht, Vreeswijk and Gorinchem by means of intentional flooding. The project, which Rietveld Landscape developed along with Atelier de Lyon, is part of a broader strategy to open up this historical landscape for recreational purposes. The seemingly indestructible bunker nr. 599 with monumental status was sliced open.
“The design thereby opens up the minuscule interior of one of NDW’s 700 bunkers, the insides of which are normally cut off from view completely. A long wooden boardwalk cuts through the extremely heavy construction and leads visitors to a flooded area and to the footpaths of the adjacent natural reserve.”
The landscaping project is a great contribution to the understanding of this landscape and the tangibility of history. The project plays with the historical tragedy of the Dutch military defense ideas. The plan to create this defense line was ambitious and brilliant. It used the geographical condition of the Dutch landscape and its water learning from the Dutch Independence War (1568-1648) and Napoleon’s bloody defeat at Russia’s Dnjepr (1812). On the other hand, it was brilliance in the wrong period in history: in 1940, the Dutch were prepared for a guerrilla war… on skates. The Germans came with airplanes to bomb Rotterdam and drop paratroopers behind the front line. The New Dutch Waterline therefore has never been properly used.

Brooklyns Aladdin Theater hosts Japan earthquake-relief concert
$215,000 RAISED
For two special shows on March 27, Brooklyn's Aladdin Theater was packed - standing-room-only - as people flocked to enjoy a most eclectic mix of music acts at the 'From Oregon with Love' concert.
Having sold out the evening concert just hours after it was announced, organizers added a second show earlier the same day - both of them to raise money for Mercy Corps Oregon's Japan Relief Fund, in aid of Japanese victims of the recent massive earthquake there.
Acts ranging from the internationally-popular show band Pink Martini, to the Oregon Ballet Theater, to singer Storm Large, didn't disappoint ticketholders - providing a colorful, memorable musical program.
Near the beginning of the second show, at the theater located just south of Powell Boulevard on S.E. Milwaukie Avenue, the audience cheered when the master of ceremonies introduced Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, who had stopped by to speak for a few moments.
Kitzhaber began by thanking the event's organizers, and recognizing dignitaries in the audience, including Japan's Consul General.
'Let me start by saying, first and foremost, that Cylvia [Hayes] and I, on behalf of all Oregonians, send our hearts out to the people of Japan; our friends across the Pacific who've lost their homes, lost their communities, and lost their loved ones.
'The level of destruction has been so great that no nation could possibly meet all the needs of their own people in the aftermath of an event of the magnitude that we witnessed several weeks ago. That's why we're here.'
From the historical perspective, Kitzhaber observed that the Japanese-American Society of Oregon was started here in 1907. 'Oregon and Japan have a long history of a mutually-beneficial relationship. Many Oregon businesses trade products and services in Japanese markets.'
The governor concluded, 'With events like the concert in this auditorium tonight, we're going to continue to gather the resources necessary to provide help to the affected communities which so desperately need it. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you for helping this important cause. Oregonians are generous people; very generous people. Our friends at Japan have asked for help, and we will answer the call.'
Asked why he donated the use of the venue, lights, and sound, for the concert, Aladdin Theater manager Tom Sessa said, 'It's our way of giving back to the community.'
With that, the concert began. The two benefit concerts at the Aladdin that day raised $215,000 for the assistance of Japanese earthquake victims.

Scene: Dropping Little Bit off at daycare
DH says, "Son, you need to leave your toys in the car. (points to front door of daycare) Miss Donna* put up a sign that says everyone has to leave their toys at home."
Little Bit considers this.
"Let's pretend it says 'yes'!"
DH quickly says, "OK. Then we'll pretend we took the toys inside."
Little Bit considers this...hrmmmm...then, he leaves his toys in the car.
*We live in the South, ya'll. All the daycare teachers are addressed as Miss Donna, Miss Kate, etc. Little Bit is also taught to say "Yes, ma'am" or "Yes, sir" as appropriate.
---------------------
I'm way behind on reading/commenting on the usual blogs I read, and of course I haven't posted much lately. There's only so much "free" time in the day; lately I've been reading personal finance blogs and getting lots of good ideas about being frugal and tricks to keep on budget, and so on. Either that or trying to catch up on the DVR'ed shows recorded while we watch the evening cartoons with Little Bit.
Little Bit is staying up later than he probably should. We let him watch his favorite cartoons on Noggin, which end at 8pm. By the time we get him to sleep, it can be past 8:30pm. That doesn't leave much evening. Last night we actually got him into bed and asleep by 7:30pm. He had quite a day though. He woke up feeling out of sorts, wanting to gather all his toys and things around himself on the couch. He really didn't want to go to daycare; he seemed like he might have a bit of a bug. So, he got to stay home with DH for some extra attention. When he felt better in the afternoon, they played outside for awhile. Unfortunately, Little Bit got really overheated very quickly. He has my fair skin, but he also has a high normal body temperature, and his face broke out in a heat rash.
This morning, Little Bit broke my heart protesting getting dressed to go to daycare. He kept crying for me to come hold him, while DH tried to put on a fresh pull-up.
Little Bit yelled, "No pull-up! I baby!"
:-( It broke my heart. He's been feeling insecure I think. I would imagine it's rough trying to dance along that line between wanting to get out and explore and wanting to be held close and safe by mom and dad. In another 10 years or so, we'll get to go through his puberty. Wheeeeee.
DH and I are thinking about taking Little Bit out of daycare part-time. That way he can get more one-on-one attention from his dad. Socialization is good, but he's only almost three. He's just a little feller.

He's just a little feller
Scene: Dropping Little Bit off at daycare
1 comment:
As a follow-up: we talked to the daycare folks, getting their advice on how best to give Little Bit what he needs. After all, they've raised thousands of kids, and we value their opinions (even though ultimately we make the choices about what to do with our own child).
We considered leaving things as they are (5 days of full-time daycare); going to a 3- or 2-day schedule of daycare (home the other days); going to a half-day schedule; or pulling him from daycare.
Starting on Monday we'll be switching Little Bit to half-days at daycare, 5 days a week. That way he will continue to get the socialization and learning that they can give him; he'll get a regular schedule that isn't changing so much he can't keep track of it; and he'll get a whole afternoon of one-on-one Daddy Time, five days a week. Hopefully it will be the best of both worlds, and give him what he needs.
We're planning to do this at least through the summer, or until I get full time work again, whichever comes first. The neighborhood park is just 3 blocks away, with wonderful swing sets, slides, and such. And in a few weeks the pool will be open. I'll be able to teach him to swim. (Yes, I'm trained to do that.) It should be a glorious summer, lots of good memories for us both, and hopefully less stress and more reassurance in Little Bit's life.
We'll see. Wish us luck. :-)

Part on-screen adaptation of Stephanie Meyer’s book series puts a twist on the massively conflicted romantic drama commonly found in vampire movies, blending lovesick teens with fast-paced plot development into a very uncommon package. The result is an intoxicatingly addictive series of cinematic adventures that has taken the world by storm, bringing in a combined total of more than $240 million on their opening weekends.
Let’s take a stab at some of my personal favorite vampire flicks, shall we?
Bram Stoker’s Dracula
This adaptation of Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel by Francis Ford Coppola is a fantastic piece of excess in every way. While favoring a more vindictive Count Dracula instead of the novel’s bloodthirsty version, Coppola’s approach remains deliciously gritty.
This classic, but timeless take on vampire lore features a star studded cast including Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, Gary Oldman, Tom Waits, Monica Bellucci and Keanu Reeves. Bringing in nearly $90 million in total gross sales at the box office, Bram Stoker’s Dracula is the number seven highest-grossing vampire movie since 1978 and won three Academy Awards. Fantastic acting coupled with incredibly engaging storytelling makes this one of my all-time vampire favorites.
The Blade Trilogy
Easily one of my favorites growing up, the Blade series is one of the better on-screen adaptions to come from the Marvel Comics camp. Wesley Snipes plays an ass kicking, daylight walking vampire-human hybrid who, to quote the movie, “… has all their strengths but none of their weaknesses.”
All three movies are a fantastically endless cavalcade of excessively gory fight scenes and not much else, but it’s not like you notice or care. I found myself sad at the end of each, as watching Snipes brutally slice and shoot anything not quite alive in his path was incredibly entrancing. Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel join Snipes in the final installment of the series, bringing with them plenty of cool gadgetry and eloquent sarcasm which contrasts nicely with Blades’ quiet and completely unfunny demeanor.
The trilogy comes in the top 20 top grossing vampire movies since 1978 at roughly $250 million total gross. This movie is everything you want in a vampire action movie: cool gear, good soundtrack and gratuitous amounts of gore.
The Lost Boys
Aw yeah, you know you loved it too.
Even though it came out before I was born, this was another favorite of mine growing up. A veritable pop culture phenomenon, even though it only squeaked out $32 million in total gross box office sales, The Lost Boys was an instant cult classic. Recognizing that internal strife between small groups of people makes for great drama, director Joel Schumacher shows a pair of brothers being unwillingly dragged into one increasingly tense and dangerously cool situation after another.
Fantastic marketing, great music and superb acting had teens across the country thinking that all you needed to be cool was a pair of Wayfarer sunglasses and a rebel attitude.
What are your favorite vampire movies? Did you see these movies in the theater? Feel free to share your comments and experiences in the comment section below!

Well, I have to say, I was very pleased with this product. Been meaning to try it for ages, but I make my own tooth powders and pastes and, well, why would I need to? I had traipsed on over to David Wolfe’s place for an order (excellent customer service, by the way) and decided to give it a try. Good stuff. Anyway, I will definitely be trying to formulate my own Joyous Gum Oil
I have most of the ingredients. For now, this is a really great product.
Instructions direct to use “6 drops” on your toothbrush; however, I don’t think that much is even necessary. It is not “oily” feeling in the mouth; but whatever gets around the outside of your mouth and lip area is
No prob, though, really.
Teeth felt very clean, non-oily, and, wow, fresh breath! Not that mine is all THAT bad
Lol. But really *really* effective! They found a great combination of essential oils and in perfect amounts. Wonderful. Now, hopefully, I can duplicate it! AND breath stayed fresh…which is not common. Alot of mouthwashes, for example, smell good for 10 minutes then it’s back to halitosis dominosis! This is like a tooth cleaner and mouthwash in one.
Probably since bad breath comes from the stomach too. And, of course, in between teeth! Flossing, is a *must.*
For flossing, this is the one I use most often, Eco-Dent’s:
Another good one I find in stores is JASON’S Vege-Wax Floss; but it’s not on their site for some reason! It may be discontinued…too bad, really, it’s a top product. It’s compact; so this one, I keep in my car, lol.

Also good is Dessert Essence, which has some other good, vegan products (but *always* read labels!):

The Joshua’s Foot Prayer Walkers gather once a quarter for approximately two hours to pray for various neighborhoods, communities and businesses. This group of volunteers also participates in a soft evangelism push as they make their way through the neighborhoods and offer one-on-one prayer for those in need. This is a great opportunity to be the hands and feet of Christ and fulfill the great commission.
The Praying to Change Your Life Prayer Classes are primarily held twice a year, once in the Spring and again in the Fall, for ten weeks. Assistance is needed in the following areas: registration, set-up, tear down, product sales and resource library. These volunteer positions require flexibility in order to accommodate the evening, weekend and soon coming day classes. Some Prayer Classes are held at various locations throughout the Houston Metropolitan area and would require limited travel.
Office Assistants help The Prayer Institute staff members with the day-to-day operations of the ministry. Tasks include but are not limited to: data entry, Internet research, bulk mail-outs, processing of product orders, inventory, and binder assembly. This volunteer position is primarily during working hours, Monday-Friday, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. If you are available to assist in the office, please complete the Office Volunteer Application.
The Prayer Power Lines are open Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and/or Fridays from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The Prayer Partners answer incoming phone calls and pray with individuals over the phone. They also return phone calls to those that have left prayer request messages during off hours. Prayer Partners must be knowledgeable in the Word of God as well as familiar with praying the Model Prayer format. Training is available.

Huckabee's Evolution Beliefs
Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Sam Brownback, and Tom Tancredo raised their hands during Thursday's debate when asked if they don't believe in evolution:
Huckabee, in a conference call with reporters the morning after the debate, explained how he would have responded if given a chance to elaborate on the question:
"If you want to believe that you and your family came from apes, that's fine. I'll accept that," he said Friday. "I just don't happen to think that I did."Huckabee's views about his faith are sincere. Prior to his political career Huckabee was pastor of several Southern Baptist churches. He also served as president of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention.
As for what should be taught in public schools, Huckabee said he wants "schools to acknowledge that there are views that are different than evolution."
Huckabee downplayed the role evolution should have in the election. "Is a president going to sit in the Oval Office and really make a decision on what's being taught in a third-grade class in Dubuque, Iowa, on creation or evolution?" he said. "The answer is no."

yeah we just magically appeared on the face of the earth by the power of an invisible guy in the sky :D
I wonder can you trust such an ingorant guy like this to be the next president of the United States?
Anyway Ron Paul is the real deal. He is the only constitutionalist, founding fathers style candidate.
We just appeared magically on the face of the earth? Do you not find the irony in your comment?
Which takes more faith, the belief that God created us or that the earth "Magically" appeared and we happened to evolve over millions of years from
non-living organisms?
In the end we will all find out who is right and who is wrong. I win either way. You on the other hand, do not.
I wish you and your eternal salvation the best.
And what about the Easter Bunny?
People who have their heads up their ass and have not bothered to read any science are quick to paint evolutionary theory as'magical' but please take a look at dogs. Humans bred them for certain shapes and forms. Evolution does the same thing to all species, only not so fast and not so end-minded
As to my 'Salvation', it is your devil: You go to hell
Using dog breeding as an example of evolution is laughable. Breeding removes certain genes, it does not add them. You could never breed a great Dane from a chihuahua. Dog breeds came from a genetically varied common ancestor dog, probably akin to a heinz-57. Evolution presupposes the addition of genetic information. Adaptation has always been the loss of genetic information.
As to salvation: Jesus Christ is the Way the Truth and the Life. Nobody goes to heaven but by Him. (paraphrase of John 14:6)
i am dyslexic and pray to dog. dog breed is a valuable analogy to evolution. bacterial reproduction with a genetic change for survival with every million divisions would answer the genetic variability. About great danes and chihuahuas look at cock a poos. THey are tiny if mom is a micro poodle or almost cocker sized if mom is a cocker. It all follows the same rules from viruses to whales. I suggest those who think evolution is only a theory could jump off a building since gravity too is only a theory requiring a similar leap of faith. Faith is self fulfilling prophesy.
Michael, you don't anything about evolution. Dog breeding is an example of selection for new genes.
Darwin used the example of pigeon breeding to explain selection and then natural selection. You should read the Origin of Species so you can be better informed about the discussion is all about.
I’m a life long Evolution supporter and frankly, believe that the debate between Creation and Evolution is about as useful as debating chocolate cake v. tennis balls. But since the war will be waged, I must caution my science-minded brethren of the risk of using dog breeding in their defense. Breeding necessitates the presence of a Breeder, which if I were a Creationist, would use to fuel my argument. Thankfully, I am not.
I find the fact that any serious presidential candidate would not accept evolution as science appalling.
Either the politician does not understand science or is not courageous enough to deal with the massive ignorance that is out there.
If you have any doubts, take a look at the Dover decision,
As to visualizing how it works, I think the most amazing display is the evolution of horses at the Museum of Natural History in New York.
The reason why acceptance of evolution is important is a good test for Presidential candidates is also simple.
If you don't betlieve in it, what other basic science don't you accept?
Personally, I do not understand why people find evolution incompatible with religion. As the Catholic Shcurch's International Theological Commission wrote in 2002
"[A]ccording to the Catholic understanding of divine causality," the commission wrote, "true contingency in the created order is not incompatible with a purposeful divine providence."
Hickabee believes dinosaurs and humans roamed the earth together just 6,000 years ago.
If this is the sort of half-wit that is given serious consideration for public office we're all going to need divine intervention to survive.
God Created Evolution.
I salute Mike Huckabee for having the courage to take a stand against you pagan evolutionists.
Where were you 5 billion years ago or even 6000 thousand years ago? God designed and created all things and loves all you ignorant humans who think you have all the answers with your pseudo-science. You pseudo-scientists change your mind every time the wind blows. You can't reproduce what God through Jesus has done and you can't accurately explain much of it either!
Wooh. This Jim guy is a nutcase. Evolution is backed by science and universally accepted by the science community. Creationism, isn't. Why, because you cannot apply the scientific method for it. It is merely pieces of information take from various data to try to make their model fit.
Oh, and as for Jim. Prove it. Minus your book of fairy tales.
I believe that Huckabee is an ape.
If having faith in God makes me a nutcase then so be it.
I have a BS in Biology from a major university in this country. Universally accepted is a bit strong.
There are plenty of scientists out there that share my world view that acknowledges the Creator God and still hold that evolution is an unproven theory. Not all of them are going to speak out because they want to keep their jobs.
As for you, truth, I feel sorry for any one that feels that the Holy Scriptures is a book of fairy tales.
Also, you and your beloved scientific community whom you apparently worship haven't proven much either.
Huckabee has my vote if he wins the nomination.
Jim said:"I have a BS in Biology from a major university in this country"
Sure you do Jim. Let me guess, Bob Jones University. Perhaps "universally accepted" is a bit strong. How about "planetarally accepted"? How you can do biology and not accept the single unifying priciple of that science is beyond me.
No it's not Bob Jones. It happens to be from a large State supported University.
It's a mute point as to what planet I'm from. Evolution is still a theory. I think for myself.
Study history a little bit. Human beings are routinely wrong and in large numbers.
I can see no fault with the scientific method as I remember it. The problem is that you have imperfect humans that are applying it.
As for the Holy Scriptures, they are inspired by God and do not contradict themselves. It's our feeble attempts at times to understand all the wonderful things that God has done that is contradictory.
I believe God loves all of us and has great patience with us even though we disagree.
It's stubborn and intolerant people like the BOTH of you which paralyzes any real progress in this country.
I bet there's more that you two could agree on that you think. Why can't people just agree to disagree and move on.
...That's a rhetorical question.
The difference between "evolutionists" and "creationists" (or "intelligent-designists" or whatever) is that the creationists already know the answer: to quote a bumper sticker, "God said it and I believe it and that settles it." Evolutionists have a much harder job - every piece of evidence (fossil, biological, whatever) is a potential challenge to the theory of evolution. The evidence that organisms evolve is pretty compelling - antibiotic-resistant bacteria are available anytime for a debate! The evidence that humans evolved from "lower" life forms is also pretty substantial, but surely has lots of surprises left for us.
Evolutionists are often accused of being closed-minded for not allowing "alternative explanations" into the classroom, but nothing could be more closed-minded than mandating the answer at the start and trying to adjust all information to fit that view. And that's just not science.
So to me, the main difference between evolutionists and creationists is that the former are continually looking to refine their understanding, while the latter are continually looking to validate theirs.
Having spent 7 years being led by someone who knew the answers without (or in spite of) any supporting information, I'm sure not eager to continue that trend.
So Mike, go ahead and lead a flock of your faithful; Baptist minister is the perfect job! But we need more critical thinking from the leader of our nation.
Hey anonymous. You are probably right.
There is probably a lot we do agree on.
I'm sure you all are pretty good folks and love our country.
What do you mean by real progress?
I'm with Rush, I think we have had great progress.
This is still the greatest nation that has ever existed because of our love of freedom and liberty which originated with God's Law.
I would like that everyone who does not believe in evolution gets last years flue shots. The virus can't evolve, so what's the point to update the vaccine?
In my humble opinion, I believe God placed all the genetic material that a certain group of animals could ever possibly exhibit.
I like to think of it like programing a computer because isn't genetic material basically information?
It makes sense to me that HE equipped viruses with the ability to survive just like HE created in us the ability in our bodies to defend ourselves against them.
I challenge all of you out there to read Genesis 1:29, Leviticus 11and Deuteronomy 14 in the Old Testament and then try that diet.
I think you will find you get viral and bacterial infections less often and when you do, your immune system will be stronger to fight off the infection.
GOD loves all of you out there and does not want you to be sick!
Before anyone responds, I would like to point out that I am not a medical doctor and what I have written is therefore not intended as medical advice.
My family and I do our best to follow it and it works for us.
I do want to say this as well. I'm sorry if I came across a little bent when I first entered this little debate and I hope I did not alienate anyone.
I try my best to be a sincere Christian who truely loves his neighbor.
If I saw you on the street and it was obvious you needed help, I'm not going to ask you if you what your party affiliation is or what you think about evolution. I would just help you.
I think what troubles us Christian Conservatives the most is the lack of acknowledgement of our Creator.
This Separation of Church and State stuff has gone way too far. God has blessed our nation so much. Why would we turn our back on Him?
Walk around DC and inside our federal government buildings and you see acknowledgement of GOD all over the place.
It is blatantly obvious to me that the Founding Fathers were believers in God.
But yet when I go to a Natural Science museum, I am supposed to tell my precious children that it all happened by chance and that is the only option I am supposed to give them?
This is probably one of the biggest reasons homeschooling is growing. I'm sure most homeschoolers teach their kids both options.
There needs to be more choice out there as far as education is concerned. We have competition in just about everything else.
I've got to admit, I have struggled at times to understand how the science I learned in high school and college fits with what I have learned about the Bible.
The result has been I think a stronger faith in God and I believe I have found answers that are as close to being correct as anyone else has come up with.
For example, I believe that after the first sentence in the Bible a large expanse of time probably did happen.
The account in Genesis may just be describing a re-creation of the earth after an earlier calamity during which the dinosaurs and so called "neanderthal man" were destroyed.
If this is true, Noah would not have had to worry about getting dinosaurs on the ark.
At some point in the ancient past the devil did rebel because evil was already present in the garden.
Hey Jim,
What should I tell your Hindu brothers or your Budist brothers or your Islamic brothers? Are their stories of creation any less valid then our Christain stories? Is their US citizenship in this great country any less valid then yours or mine? ChurchState is there for a reason. Even within the Christain faiths there is large diversity of beliefs. ChurchState is there so that for example the Catholics cannot impose their views on the Protestent denominations. I would think our founding fathers would agree with that.
Hello Annonymous. I actually agree with you. I hear what you are saying.
May be all my brothers' stories need to be heard including the Catholic way of thinking. Isn't this what education is all about?
I've got the sense to realize that most of our spiritual teaching should come from home and church.
My point is that evolution and big bang in the way they are taught (at least to me that is) seem to make no room for GOD at all.
This is the difference I see when I walk around Washington and read all the wonderful inscriptions acknowledging GOD and then I go to a Natural Science museum and the idea of a Creator is no where to be found.
I think things have gotten a little out of balance. I believe that there are probably thousands of good Christian Public school teachers who are showing the love of Christ to their students and I think that's wonderful.
I think its a little silly when it they feel like its "taboo" to share their personal opinion with their students that they believe GOD created it all. I don't mean that the teacher should necessarily start giving the students a bible study.
Calamity during which the dinosaurs and so called "neanderthal man" were destroyed ?? Wow. So you believe in Cretaceous neanderthals, mister biology degree from a major university ???
The thing about science is it has to work no matter which sky-fairy you believe in. Evolution works in the Hindu population as much as it does in evangelical christians. So does gravity and strong nuclear force even though those are also just "theories".
Only the laziest scientist would ever appeal to the "Quetzalcoatl did it" argument.
Ok, you've successfully nitpiked me. Good for you. Calamity, extinction, whatever... same result gone.
You evolutionists love to preach that these "so called" pre-humans are the ancestors of Homo Sapiens but you really have no proof that they are no more than just extinct apes.
As far as my BS in Biology, I've never really needed it. Due to God's grace and blessing I started my own company and became financially independent by the time I was 31.
To address your comment Doc., gravity and nuclear forces are believable because they are proven.
Your system of religion that you apparently worship which includes evolution has not been proven and is quite controversial.
I have no problem with Science that is true.
Pardon me. Nitpicked. Still not sure if that's how you spell it but I promise you they still gave me that BS in Biology back in '91.
Any nutcase can memorize some facts mingled with a little nonsense and spit it back on a test. I try to use my brain for ideas not just a warehouse for facts.
My wife did get a good laugh about my Neanderthal mistake. She said I should have asked my 7 year old son.
By the way, where are you Christians out there? I thought someone would have helped me out with a few thoughts by now.
Whether you believe in God or not is irrelevant. Evolution is fact, not theory. If we elect a president who is this stupid, we are in serious trouble.
Evolution is not a fact. Science itself says that a cell can't spontaneously form.
This issue shows for sure that Huckabee is a crazy fringe candidate that shouldn't be President. Any man that thinks the Earth was created 6000 years ago shouldn't be given the time of day in Presidential politics. Do we really want this man to become President? Doesn't the US already have a bad name as it is in the field of science and we're going to compound the problem by having this guy represent us? I don't think so. I can't in good conscious vote for a man who's crazy enough to think that dinosaurs fossils are some sort of conspiracy by paleontologists.
It seems the only candidate with any common sense is Ron Paul.
This is hardly the forum to debate the theory of evolution - there are plenty of resources out there for the intellectually inquisitive, and any thinking person can judge for themselves which arguments make more sense. Nor does arguing from authority make much of an impact - no creationist will ever be swayed by what a majority of scientists say, just as no evolutionist will give any more creedence to someon just because they have a degree in biology (and if he had a degree from Harvard, would that make any difference?). For what it's worth, I think this link has the best evidence against Huckabee's claim that he is not descended from an ape:
After what I heard Rush Limbaugh say on the radio today, I think I have changed my mind about Huckabee.
I got excited about Huckabee because of what his web site says.
I was not aware of his record as Governor of Arkansas. I'm too busy too sit around watching news programs all the time.
He may be okay as a Vice President though.
Sorry Jim.
Scientists dispute the theory of evolution just about as much as they dispute the idea that we live in a heliocentric solar system. Too bad christian fundamentalists never seem to learn from their mistakes.
Evolution can be repeatedly proven on the microbial level, and it is widely supported by conclusive evidence regarding macro-organisms, yet evangelicals continue to attack it as if it actually has an affect on their religion. I wonder why you seem to crave reinforcement of your religious beliefs from irrelevant areas of society such as science, politics, and a supposedly secular education system.
You attack Dr. Steve because his "system of religion... evolution has not been proven", but what about your own system of religion? How much proof can you offer for it?
With regards to your "founding fathers" comment, there seems to be an inconsistency with your argument: our founding fathers felt so strongly about the issue that they wanted to ensure that this country was founded with a clearly defined separation of church and state, in spite of their predominantly christian religious beliefs. Perhaps this was because they studied European history and realized what a mess can be made when religion gets intermingled with politics.
So I am curious... why do you feel the need to impose your own religious beliefs on others, through supposedly secular systems (ie: the public education system), especially when doing so is detrimental to science in this country?
Sorry up front for the long post. I can't believe I actually read through all this but I did want to see what Huckabee actually said.
Why can't there be a middle ground? The idea of a "Creator" and the "fact" of evolution are not mutually exclusive.
I have no issue with believing that a "higher being" brought the universe into being. Depending on where, when and to whom you were born, that "higher being" has a lot of different names.
The "higher being" could certainly have designed a system that we now see as evolution - a system that allowed living forms to evolve into the different life forms that we see on the planet now. I have a lot more faith that the record of life we see in the ground (fossils) and the virtually infinite varieties of life we see around us are the result of a system that is evolving as opposed to the view that a "creator" created every single life form on the planet in it's exact current form.
I know there are fundamentalists on both sides of this. Yes, the Earth could have been "created" in six days about 6,000 years ago (although it begs the question why the "creator" would have placed fossils in the ground and allowed us to "discover" radio-carbon dating to measure their age). And yes, the universe may have appeared from no-where billions of years ago with the ingredients for life (although it begs the question about how the "no-where" came into being). The reality is that there is a huge number of people in the middle ground who don't hold either fundamentalist belief.
And a huge number of people who don't understand why the Democrats and Republicans can't seem to figure out that they are alienating the vast middle ground of America with their polarizing politics. The best thing that could happen in the United States politically is for certain very wealthy and philanthropic individuals (Buffett and Gates come to mind) to take some of their dollars and use them to build the framework of a third (centrist) political party. Remove the extremists on both sides from their position of influencing the politics of the parties and tearing apart the country. Get back to government for the people - ALL the people.
And yes, it matters what Huckabee thinks. He could become our president and sets direction for the country. It matters whether he has an open attitude toward science or will dismiss it due to his belief system. It's disingenious for Huckabee to state that his personal beliefs are not relevant in the election - how many of his supporters would still be following him if he converted to become a (gasp) Mormon?
iF THE ONLY WAY TO GET INTO HEAVEN IS TO BELIEVE THAT JESUS IS YOUR SAVIOR, THEN WHO OR WHAT POPULATED HEAVEN BEFORE JESUS?
Creationism means that you say, "I can't possibly believe that the complexity of life on the Earth could have come about on its own! I believe that it had to have been designed by some infinitely MORE complex Creator, who himself came about on his own!"
I'll preface by saying I only found this blog, looking for the ridiculous quote from Huckabee... I'm certainly a proponent of evolutionary theory, by default. In fact, creationism, historically speaking, is merely a reaction to evolutionary theory. A bit of research on its origins will tell you that. And it must be noted that evolutionary theory says nothing about the origins of the universe, and yet so many of its critics bring that up. Anyway, I really wrote an adequate response to someone on the other side of the argument (a staunch evolutionist) back in 2005. As I really don't have the space, or inclination, to properly discuss the subject here, I'll point you to my response:
This point is an important one and I wish people would stop misinterpreting both sides of the equation.
Hey Bio Major. Learn to read. I was responding to my God being referred to as a "sky fairy".
I think I was the one attacked.
As far as proof, the creation speaks for itself and I worship the Creator not the creation.
I admit I don't have all the answers but neither do you.
How do you figure I'm trying to impose my beliefs on you?
I think it is the other way around.
This is why homeschooling is growing. We don't want anything to do with your secular system.
Faith is what's right with this country.
Any world view that does not acknowledge God is what's wrong with it.
I would not want to force you to believe or dis-believe anything. What good would that do?
As far as mistakes, look at the mistakes you liberals have made.
Your world view just simply does not work, not even in a billion years.
Merry Christmas!!!
Jim, I want to apologize for my earlier post. It came out as immature and inappropriate. I did not mean for it to come across as an attack on you, your beliefs, or christianity in general, but after rereading it I realize that is how it reads.
What I wanted to express is a very different point: Huckabee is running for the most powerful public office, he seems to strongly base much of his political stance on his christian religious beliefs, and he claims not to believe in evolution due to these religious beliefs. Since there is already very much controversy regarding this issue in the public school system, I am afraid of a president who might use his religious beliefs as a basis to alter the curriculum of public science instruction. (I want to say that I feel it is a different matter completely if we are discussing home-schooling).
The entire situation seems to me like it may someday be looked back upon with repulsion (didn't Americans living in the 19th century sometimes justify slavery using quotes from the bible?). I have different social and religious backgrounds than the majority of my fellow Americans, and in my opinion, popular religious beliefs are all too often interjected into public matters within the US.
I believe that if Huckabee has enough influence to become president and he supports weaving christian religious teachings into the public science curriculum in the US, it would come with severe disregard to science and to religious freedoms.
By the way, I've always had politically conservative beliefs and used to identify with (and vote for) republican candidates. However, they have lately been relating to voters and political issues more and more through their religious beliefs, and it seems that the party itself is pushing an even more christian-oriented focus than it traditionally has in the past. Even though I've never felt I was a liberal, I will probably vote for one in the upcoming presidential election for the first time because the thought of living in a nation with such a religious influence within its state structure sounds much too similar to what it might be like to live in a country such as Iran.
Hope you accept my apologies. Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas too)!
Wow! Bio Major you are a good person!! The last thing I expected was an apology.
I am sorry if I offended you as well. Please forgive me.
I have a lot of close friends that don't agree with me either but we help each other out as much as possible and don't take our differences personal.
Like I said earlier, I'm not too sure about Huckabee either. His record is somewhat questionable as Governor of Arkansas.
I am now undecided about who to vote for as President. I'm not overly excited about my choices.
I believe the Lord above is in control and we'll get the President we deserve.
God Bless you Bio Major. Please seek the Lord. I know he loves you very much.
You obviously have a lot of love in your heart or you would not have been concerned about my feelings.
I would highly recommend the Life Application Study Bible if you don't already have one. They should have them at Wal-mart.
I hope and pray that you and your family have a prosperous New Year!
Also, get straight A's!!!
How can we trust someone THIS OUT OF TOUCH with the scientific community to be president? This man REEKS of ignorance. I believe the Earth is flat, and the holocaust never happened. My ideas MUST be taught alongside the current geography/history standards!
For evidence/proof of evolution in a nice, visual vehicle, see
Why can't we have both God and evolution? Maybe that's how he chose to do it.
I like the idea that evolution is how God chose to do it. Then a much more interesting question arises. Does God ever intervene in the process?
You can have a supernatural being and evolution. Why not? Science hasn't disproved that yet. You just can't have the Christian God of the Bible and evolution. The two are mutually exclusive.
Evolution is always singled out as a threat to the validity of the Bible, but it's far from being the only one. The Bible is full of things that we reject today. Christians just chose to ignore them.
Evolution is a theory that would be easy to disprove if false. A single fossil in the wrong rock layer or a single DNA mis-match would do it. Evolution doesn't demand any faith at all. It just is the best explanation for what we see around us.
To take that idea a step further, there might well be some kind of organising principle to the universe that is currently beyond the reach of science. Let's call that thing a deity. Since nearly all human beings have some kind of spiritual awareness, let's assume that we are all responding to that deity.
Since the thousands of religions and sects and denominations are mutually incompatible, the greatest probability is that they've all got it wrong.
So a God might exist. What is absolutly certain though, is that He isn't anything like the Christian God of the Bible, who is impossible on his own terms and incompatible with what we know about the world.
The simplest proof that Christianity is wrong is to consider this: if God is timeless and universal, then belief in Him ought to be as well.
But this is not the case. A minority of the world's most devoutly religious people are Christian, and people only become Christian when exposed to other Christians. God can't do it by Himself.
A quick glance at the history of Judaism will tell you that God, or Yahweh, was invented around 4,000 BCE. He simply didn't exist before then or hadn't bothered to reveal Himself because the oldest religions date back some 70,000 years.
God and evloution do not mix. The textbook description of evolution is "a completly random process that modifies the vehicle of life". Note the "completley random". This implies that no outside interactions can be involved, including creating the process of evolution.
I have enjoyed reading this forum as it has been a clean discussion with little name calling/insults. Please keep it that way. Please do not bless me either, I believe in making my own luck.
Actually, the "text book"--nay, scientific--definition of evolution is "the frequency of change in alleles in a given population, from one generation to the next.
My comments above show precisely why people can believe in a godhead figure and still accept evolutionary theory.
Is it possible anyone in our nation would vote for a man that believes the supernatural hero from a really old novel exists???
I thought the people with such silly superstitions were a part of the time when we thought the earth was flat.
I understand there are "people of faith" in our country. I've driven across it and seen the sad population we hide in the middle. I've even seen the tacky bumper stickers they place on their cars. But isn't it all like being a Star Trek fan? Humiliating and obsessive at the same time, but nothing you'd base a meaningful decision on?
These must be the same people that watch that awful show with bad karaoke.
Jim,
"the frequency of change" is something other than evolution. You are trying to say when evolution happens, not how it happens or what it is.
Evolution is "a completly random process that modifies the vehicle of life". God can't fit into evolution. According to christians, God created Adam and Eve in his image, he didn't make them into his image. So evolution can't fit into christian thesim either.
Whomever said that evolution is "the reduction of genes" is incorrect. Evolution may add or remove genes but it is not pureley the reduction of genes.
Meldor --
My name's not "Jim." And you're wrong. I've already defined the term and if you won't bother looking it up for yourself, then we're done here. This is basic Biology, my friend (albeit, on the university level).
Instead of looking up scientific terms in the dictionary (which deals with colloquialisms and common usage), try actually picking up a scientific text.
If you had, I wouldn't be making these comments right now.
Sorry about not adressing you by your correct name.
I have bothered to look it up. You have defined something that is not evolution. Evolution is not described as "The frequencey of change". What you are saying is the how often evolution happens. Evolution is defined as "mutations in genetic information" not the frequency of genetic changes.
This is not biology on a university/college level. We are disputing the definition of evolution, which I learned back in 8th grade.
I would suggest reading the first chapter or two of "Defeating darwinism by opening minds" by Phillip E. Johnson. Don't bother to read past the first two chaters. This book explains why evolution and theism don't mix in the first chapter. Yes, I read the books of my opponent.
Okay, you've cited your source--a retired LAW professor, who's well-known for being intellectually dishonest (cf.).
Now I'll cite MY sources:
For a decent article on evolution (in terms of biology), the Wikipedia entry is actually really, really, ridiculously good (and it cites an additional 174 sources, currently):
The FAQ at Talk Origins has been around for a long, long time (1994), was written excluslively by scientists (mostly biologists), in an attempt to provide mainstream answers to scientific questions, and is widely accepted in the scientific community. You can read a specific entry, relevant to this discussion here:
I suggest you read the entire general FAQ as well:
Both of these sources are readable and intelligible. If read thoroughly, I'm certain a reasonable person will better understand evolution (in terms of biology), evolutionary theory, and science (how it operates, its methodology, etc.) in general.
Instead of citing non-specialists (and eight grade biology teachers) and being intellectually dishonest, try actually going STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE with reference to these issues.
I simply suggested that you read a part of that book. I have yet to quote from this or use any knowedge from this book or Phillip E. Johnson, not that I ever would.
I said that I understood the definition of evolution (and how it worked) in 8th grade, not that I was taught about evolution in 8th grade.
I will look at your sources after I finish this post. Something that I still notice is that you have not accepted what the meaning/definition of evolution is. I would repeat my previous description of evolution but I don't wan't to appear closed minded by repeating the same thing over and over.
After 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school and 8 years of residency and fellowship it still frightens me that the ignorant and uneducated 'Faithests' (yes I made that word up) have a chance at running the country and influencing future generations. I weep for the future of the human race.
... nothing you'd base a meaningful decision on
Anonymous has hit the nail on the head. Religion occupies a fuzzy place in our collective mentality. Not reliable or 'real' enough to base any serious decisions on - hence our government, police and courts are strictly secular - and at the same time yet not quite fake enough to be fully rejected, like Santa Claus, or ghosts.
I find it interesting that Tony Blair kept his religion a secret in England until he left politics. The English regard US-style expressions of religious belief with horror, and as something that has nothing to do with the serious matter of running the country.
Alright, I found where you got your definition of evolution (Helena Curtis and N. Sue Barnes, Biology, 5th ed. 1989 Worth Publishers, p.974).
That description is defining what a genetic mutation is, a change in the sequence of genes.
Evolution is a process of genetic mutation and natural selection. Macroscopic evolution takes millions of years to occur. Since Christians believe the earth is a mere six thousand years old, evolution can’t possibly fit into their methodology-unless their book needs another revision (mind you, the all knowing god’s work needs to be corrected, again).
Besides, a deity can't manipulate genetic code. If a deity does, evolution becomes creationism and its not, its science.
According to Christians, God created Adam and Eve in his image; he didn't make them into his image. Evolution and theism can't mix because changing either, just a little, invalidates both. There is no wobble room here.
Just so it’s clear, I'm on evolution's side.
Jake,
You might want to look up "church of the flying spaghetti monster". Actually, everybody should look up the FSM (flying spaghetti monster).
Meldor --
Who said anything about New Land Creationism? You're bordering a straw man argument with that presupposition. Anyway, the best way I can rebut is to repost a response to an article I made back in June of 2005. Oddly enough, it was the exact same argument and after reading it over, I'd said much of the same things I'm saying now. Either way, here it is (I've not included a link to the article I was originally responding to because it's really not that important with regards to this particular discussion):
I read the above article by Eugene Volokh earlier today, and found his commentary on the evolutionism/creationism debate to be the ordinary and expected polarizing viewpoint purporting science and religion as coexistive. Though his belabored point came across to me, I am highly doubtful that most would understand the real problem here: the fact that there really is no debate between evolutionism and creationism at all. He concludes with:
"Yet scientific popularizers and educators have to deal with the fact that in our society, many people are still religious, and still accept descriptive religion (at least ostensibly). If the popularizers and educators describe science as taking no stand on the existence or influence of God, and as leaving such questions to others, I think they’ll have great success; and, whether they want to or not, they will indeed further undermine descriptive religion. But if they insist, in my view unnecessarily, that the standard scientific theory does take a stand that God is not influencing the world -- and that accepting evolution as the best scientific hypothesis while seeing God’s hand in its operation is an inferior conclusion that is worthy of scientific criticism -- then they will encounter much more resistance."
Though he may not be doing so on purpose, he's really just polarizing the two issues--forcing science into a box he's created with his straw man argument with regards to the "scientific standard" that evolutionary theory posits. For more on that, please read his article. I did comment directly on the Huffington Post site, however, the response itself--though slightly contingent on his article--is basically self-sufficient; and so here it is:
First of all, the “standard scientific theory” with regards to evolutionary theory is not as stated above; rather, evolutionary theory is simply the frequency of change in alleles—in a given population—from one generation to the next.
You’ve touched on an all too common misunderstanding of evolutionary theory—and science in general, for that matter: that somehow, not dealing with god (and in this case, we are clearly discussing the god of the Abrahamic religions) is synonymous to denying god as a potential mover or designer, and essentially, that god “had no part in this process.” Simply put, given the empirical nature of science, metaphysical things, as such, have no place in scientific theories..
Is creationism a “theory” then? Using our scientific terminology it cannot be—given, the only “evidence” of creationism lies in the Bible. And let’s try not to forget that a) the Bible is not a scientific text, b) the Bible never claims to be a scientific text, and c) the “creationism” referenced here began as a movement in the late nineteen-hundreds, following Darwin’s Origin of the Species. Instead of addressing problems with Darwin’s theory (of natural selection—now considered a mechanism of modern evolutionary synthesis), this movement immediately constructed a red herring by ignoring the premises and jumping at the seemingly abject conclusion—that there is no intelligent designer. Either way, we are talking about apples and oranges here, folks.
Remember people, you can believe in the god of the Abrahamic religions, while accepting modern evolutionary synthesis. You can believe in “intelligent design.” However, you cannot be a “creationist” as referenced in the above article, and accept modern evolutionary synthesis, since this movement of creationism—commonly referred to Young Earth or New Land Creationism—was a knee-jerk reaction to early Darwinian evolutionary theory.
I encourage all interested parties to take a detailed look at reputable references like Wikipedia or TalkOrigins, before perpetuating these detrimental misapplications of evolutionary theory.
According to you (you are correct here),
“.
“
You yourself have said it. “God”—a word, a concept, an idea, a symbol of belief, etc.—cannot be introduced into scientific theory because scientific theory is bound by methodology (cf., scientific method).
Scientific theory and theism can’t mix. They can not combine in any way without changing the other in a way that is still retains what the original meaning was.
Yes, I can see how I am using a “straw-man argument”. It is the only course of action I have not already taken as I have already correctly defined your definitions of words and clarified the process of evolution.
You've not clarified anything. You've only made the argument that much more confusing. Go back and read EVERYTHING I said. And also re-read the original argument you made that I took issue with. I stated clearly that one can believe in a "godhead figure" and still "accept evolutionary theory." You have taken that to mean fundamental Christianity (which baffles me) and have completely construed my meaning. You've still not completely accepted the actual, biological definition of evolution. But most importantly, you still miss the point:
People can believe in "god" a creator--in "Intelligent Design"--and still accept science for what it is. For a reasonable person understands that science is scientific and god belief is not--nor does it claim to be.
Do not deal only with fundamentals and creationists because that's not all that's out there. And what you, or I, believe or do not believe is irrelevant to this discussion. What is relevant is that many people out there strongly believe in a god creator, and still accept evolutionary theory as a credible scientific explanation concerning how things change over time.
I don't know how much more simplistic I can get. What began as a simple pointing out of a hasty generalization you made, turned into a biological discussion (of which I still think you need to do a bit of reading), and now we're back to the beginning and my point is still fuzzy in your head.
Really take a few moments--perhaps a few days--and re-read everything here and really delve into my sources. You might learn something about evolutionary theory and you might also learn something about the Abrahamic religions.
And with that, I leave you. I can't entertain this discussion anymore. I haven't the time, nor the inclination. Best of luck.
For those of you who believe that evolution is a fact and that every scientist believes it, do yourselves a favor and start actually looking at the body of scientific work disputing its validity...religion aside.
Check the following link and please try to keep an open mind - there are 5 parts:
I believe the Lord above is in control and we'll get the President we deserve
Wow, Jim, you're right. Let's cancel the election, and determine who God wants us to have by throwing dice? Or perhaps a religious committee of church elders could decide for us?
I never said that you can't believe in god and evolution. I said "God can't fit into evolution". Look who isn't reading now.
God is a supernatural being. Science does not rely on and can't include supernatural beings because science relies on natural occurrences. So, if you want to include god as a mechanism for evolution, in a philosophical debate, that’s fine. But the theory of evolution is a scientific theory and science is, by definition, exclusive of the supernatural.
I'm sorry if this is hard to follow, I wrote it as I watched the video. As for the Youtube videos:
Part I
Darwin didn’t rebel against Christianity.
Nice, “Carl marks, an atheist and the originator of communism”. What does communism have to do with evolution? Nothing, I saw that attempt to associate atheism with “evil”. How the hell was evolution fundamental in the creation of communism?
We have observed one form of life evolve into another. Look at pests, they become resistant to pesticides because the ones that have superior genes can survive against them. Yes, a worm could potentially turn into a superior being similar to Homo-sapiens, given billions of years, not millions.
The earth is old. New rock have been forming much faster that old rocks have been staying. If I have a very old house, am I likely to have all the original material in that house?
It is true that most genetic mutations are fatal. However, some of those changes are beneficial. Over time, there are enough beneficial changes to make an organism qualify as a new species when compared to its ancestors.
Part II
For an incomplete and very short list of common transitional form please visit. It would be more credible if this video showed these scientists contradicting themselves. Because of erosion and lack of fossilization in the first place, there are some gaps. We have enough transitional forms to accurately prove that they exist.
Can we see a copy of this quote from doctor Peterson? Darwin said he had a lack of transitional forms because they had not been discovered yet, see above link.
Monkeys didn’t turn into humans, monkeys and humans shared a common ancestor that turned into two distinct species. Those species eventually evolved into what they are today.
I already addressed the issue of evolution with insects becoming resistant to pesticides. To clarify, those are minor changes. If you have enough minor changes you will get a noticeable macroscopic change.
The “missing links that troubled Darwin” have been found. There is no misrepresentation (see “”). Please stop repeating yourself, its getting boring and becoming a waste of my time.
Those “prehuman” footprints are called “Paluxy river manprints”. It was a hoax and has been disproven. For more information about this see about halfway down the page.
The Homo neanderthalensis (Neanderthals) is not part of the evolutionary chain that lead to homo sapiens (humans), you are thinking of homo cromagnum (cromagnums). That “pig” AKA “Nebraska man” was a hoax
The bursts in evolution are real and are not some cheap ploy to keep evolution alive. Some of these bursts were because of enviromental changes. Some examples include the oxygen rich period called the carboniferous period which was caused by the evolution of spores which enabled more plants. More plants means more oxygen, more oxygen means more animals. Another example of an evolutionary burst is when organisms could become multicellular, enabling them to become insanely more complex. What caused the video to bring this up? “lack of transitional forms”. Once again, look up. I have already coved this and recall saying not to bring this up, why am I answering the same question a third time? I’m beginning to feel like I’m on a reality show.
This “instant reptile to bird” thing is bullshit. Stop looking for a “brick wall” where a reptile suddenly becomes a bird. You can find it because it evolution doesn’t work like that.
“the scientific evidence for creationism is much stonger than the evidence of evolution”. I’ll cite my evidene, you site yours? As a token of good will, genetic markers caused by inactive retroviruses and.
Evolution has been observed, look at the pesticide resistant pests or the evolution of a microorganism.
Part III
We can’t suggest that life came from outer space? Where does your god live? Certantly not in the atmosphere, I’m sure an airplane would have come near enough for pictures by now…
Evidence of evolution, genetic markers caused by inactive retroviruses and
I’m not sure what this “humanism” is but we have scientific evidence to support evolution. “Parents will not say anything about something taught in the classroom that disturbs them”, untrue. Lookup the “Dover trial”. See also,.
Here we are again, associating atheism with the soviet union. Guess what, the soviet union isn’t the only country presenting evolution as fact. There is this country called the United States of America that does it to.
Scientists don’t want creationism taught in public schools any more that preachers want evolution taught in Sunday school.
“The only approach is to present all the scientific information to children and let them make up their own minds”. We do present all the scientific information to children. The government doesn’t force the children to believe in evolution either, they can make up their own minds if they want to.
Creationism is not non-religious. It requires a higher being to be creationism and that higher being is god(s/es/esses).
The relevant discussion is not what the definition of evolution is, it's whether or not you feel comfortable with a presidential candidate whose self described "faith" (belief without need of facts) causes him to disregard a stack of scientific facts.
There is no controversy about evolution, other than what some people who don't like it stir up, and that controversy is largely confined to the US. In other industrialized nations, as in the scientific community itself, evolution is *very* widely accepted. I could footnote, but that would probably be boring, so I won't bother at this time.
If a person finds a scientific theory distasteful, or in conflict with philosophical (not scientific) beliefs, that does not reduce its validity.
Nor should the word "theory" be misunderstood. Unlike the colloquial definition of theory as a guess or idea, scientific theories undergo rigorous examinations, are supported by facts, and allow predictions to be made. When such predictions turn out to be true, they validate the theory.
Other scientific theories include germ theory, relativity, and much of mathematics, yet we can use them to make medicines, nuclear power plants, and computers. Still, they are "only" theories.
My point is that Huckabee has STATED that he puts irrational and controversial beliefs ahead of science facts. That makes me wonder if he will do the same when it comes to making important political decisions. Mr. Huckabee, should Iran be invaded as it might have nuclear weapons? Should the decision be influenced by the fact that they are inimical to Isreal, and threatn the dominance of your religious beliefs? What if your god "spoke" to you and said "nuke them first"?
I can think of 3 governments which are *heavily* influenced by religious fundamentalism that the US has recently been involved with: Afghanstan (under the Taliban), Iraq (Shiites vs. Sunnis), and Iran. Other Western governments are not so influenced by religion as we in the US are, and our fascination with the religious beliefs of our candidates puzzles their citizens.
If we, in the US, want to continue down the road paved by other heavily fundamentalistic nations, then we should endorse candidates with fundamental beliefs.
If, instead, we want to uphold the constitution (specifically the establishment clause), then we must divorce right-wing religious influence from politics.
Nicely said Jim.
Reducing the question to one of whether humans came from monkeys misses a tremendous amount of what science has taught us. I believe the universe, and perhaps God are more marvelous for being 15 billion years old than for being, as creationists tell us, 6,000 years old.
Science education needs to go back to the beginning of the universe with the big bang. From nothing came everything. It started with positive and negative energy, waves and particles that combined to form matter, hydrogen. Hydrogen was gathered by gravity, a mysterious force we still don’t fully understand, and formed stars. Gravity, heat and the resulting pressure fused hydrogen into helium and began the formation of all of the elements. Stars grew old, blew apart and elements were spread throughout the universe to form what we see now.
Life could not have come about without the billions of year process of forming elements from basically nothing.
I for one, marvel at the hand of God in all of this.
“Evolution” is generally seen as the process on Earth wherein elements combined into self replicating molecules that, over billions of years either were successful at reproducing and surviving in their environment or not. The survivors found niches where they could be successful and, by natural selection, were culled to where the most successful survived and the others didn’t. Each mutation that resulted in a more successful organism carried with it the best of the “parents” and developed new and more successful adaptations. It took a very long time. The planet changed life and life changed the planet. The environment creates opportunity and life takes advantage to fill the niche.
I understand the frustration of those who perceive that God is left out of science. Science deals with the measurable, the concrete. It does not disprove God to embrace science, but it does not prove God either. Faith should be arrived at in homes and churches, not schools.
Whether we think the universe is 6,000 or 15,000,000,000 years old we still need to ponder the questions of faith. Evolution still doesn’t answer the question of what caused the big bang. The laws of motion, the dualistic (particle/wave) nature of energy and the forces of nature have guided the development of the universe into something that supports consciousness, in us. Consciousness, God’s or ours, is not readily explained by science.
I love the metaphorical beauty I see in the Bible. I don’t expect the prophets of old to have spent their time finding literal descriptions of how the universe was created. They got what was important. A question as to how long a day was before there was a sun is pointless to faith. That we have the capacity to ponder such questions is the miracle.
We have the capacity to understand what an incredible universe we live in. We are given tools to manipulate our universe. We can preserve what billions of years has made suitable for us (stewardship) or we can commit suicide as individuals or as a species.
Perhaps that is what is meant by our having been created in the image of God.
Jake, listen to yourself, you're the one who believes in throwing dice.
Because of your unbelief, you have to explain everything by large expanses of time and chance happenings.
I'll take the candidate who has sincere faith in the Almighty, thank you very much.
As far as some of the rest of you, this is what you sound like. Blah. Blah. Blah.
Do your brain a favor and get you a good study Bible.
Jake, listen to yourself, you're the one who believes in throwing dice.
Because of your unbelief, you have to explain everything by large expanses of time and chance happenings.
Nonsense. I don't have to explain everything at all. I'm completely comfortable with knowing that we don't know everything. But we do know some things for certain.
And we know enough to know that the Bible is a bunch of baloney written by superstitious peasants thousands of years ago. And the peasants didn't even agree with each other. There are lots of websites that list the contradictions and downright nonsense and immorality in the Bible - I won't do it here.
So why on earth should intelligent people 'study' such silly fairy tales? Much less elect a person who believes in them.
Have your spirituality if it comforts you, but don't pretend that some areas of well-understood science are controversial, when they're not.
Wow Jake man. You are quite hostile toward Christianity. I would not chance going out in a thunderstorm if I were you. Just kidding!
The Christian GOD of the Bible does exist my friend and I'm sure he loves you anyway.
Lets just politely agree to disagree. You go ahead and keep worshipping your imperfect science and I will keep worshipping the perfect ONE who created you and your beloved science.
Wise men still seek JESUS.
If He, in his infinite wisdom, had any intention of smiting me, he would have done it by now. Of course I may burn in Hell for all eternity, but I very much doubt it. If I do, I'll be joining most of the human race.
As for protection in storms, God didn't seem to care much about the religious folk of New Orleans. If there is a God, He's as likely to smite you as he is me.
Actually, no one should "burn in hell". Christian's God is supposed to be "all forgiving" and should therefore not send anyone to hell.
The point is, Huckabee has blatantly ignored scientific facts and has put his belief before science. This tells me that if he becomes president, he will do what is best for his ego. He won't take in all the facts and make an educated decision based on those facts.
Truth: "Evolution is just a theory"
another truth: so is gravity. Deal with it. I just don't understand why God and evolution can't coexist.
Hey Jake. I thought you libs were blaming Katrina on Bush?
You are the first one I've heard blame God for that lately.
Man, I feel sorry for you. You sound like one angry, unhappy, bitter person.
And Meldor, you just don't have a clue.
Westcoa, I can prove gravity but you can't prove evolution.
You probably also believe that alarmist global warming bull as well.
I'm sorry Westcoa. I can respect the opinion that the book of Genesis may be allegorical and that if evolution is true, then God did it.
But comparing evolution to gravity is not a good comparison.
Well, look at me; I'm back on this channel... Oh well...
Jim --
Actually, yes, it certainly is, given the fact that both are scientific theories (a "theory," scientifically speaking, is merely a collection of corresponding facts). In terms of science, both hold the same weight. We've observed certain facts that have led us to said conclusions, whether it concerns the theory of evolution, the theory of gravity, the theory of plate tectonics, the theory of quantum mechanics, etc.
Wikipedia has a decent article on the scientific definition of "theory." Read it, and perhaps you'll modify your position.
Jim, Katrina was just weather. I don't believe God had any influence over it, mainly because he doesn't exist. I was just wondering how you can explain your God standing back and allowing terrible things to happen to innocent and / or religious people. People who pray desperately and devoutly to him, and he still smites them. That's gotta hurt.
Actually I'm a very contented person, who's happy to accept that our time on the planet is short, random and chaotic. I believe that meaning comes from making the best of it in the here and now and that makes me very calm - the opposite of angry and bitter.
And of course Genesis is allegorical. Duh. So are the plays of William Shakespeare. It's fiction - they're not meant to be taken at face value. But even if you take the 'God made evolution' line, it still contradicts Christian doctrine that mankind has a special place in the world, and is made in God's image. The whole point of evolution is that we are not special - we are quite literally related to all life on earth and we are constantly changing as our climate and environment changes around us.
The fool says in his heart, "There is no God" ... Psalm 53
I sure hope this verse of scripture does not apply to you.
I believe that if you were in our military fighting for our right to argue and your life were in danger, then I bet the Lord Almighty (Maker of heaven and earth) is the one you would call on.
I am going to pray for you Jake. I promise you God does exist.
Hello Adam.
Yes I've read the articles in the online encylopedia.
So what. That's horse-hockey.
I've stayed out of this one for a while, but here goes.
As to this all knowing, loving and caring God. Where exactly is he when 4000+ servicemen and women are being killed in Iraq? Where is he when children are taken from their homes and assaulted and murdered? Or worse, when it happens in their home by someone who they trust? Where is this God when those least able to protect themselves are so brutally treated? Where is he when children starve to death every day on this earth?
I call Bullsh!T and challenge any scripture quoting, bible thumping evangelist to answer these questions with responses other than "it must have been their time. or God called them home."
XTC said it best in the song Dear God;
,
Dont know if you noticed,
But your name is on a lot of quotes in this book.
Us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look,
And all the people that you made in your image,
Still believing that junk is true.
Well I know it aint and so do you,
Dear god,
I cant believe in,
I dont believe in,
I wont believe in heaven and hell.
No saints, no sinners,
No devil as well.
No pearly gates, no thorny crown.
Youre always letting us humans down.
The wars you bring, the babes you drown.
Those lost at sea and never found,
And its the same the whole world round.
The hurt I see helps to compound,
That the father, son and holy ghost,
Is just somebodys unholy hoax,
And if youre up there youll perceive,
That my hearts here upon my sleeve.
If theres one thing I dont believe in...
Its you,
Dear god."
And finally; No, we should not being electing a man who does not believe in evolution. We've had 7 years of a president who stayed true to his inane convictions and look what that has brought us.
So, if you dont believe in evolution, how do you explain dinosaur bones? And the thousands of years old human-like remains that arent quite human, arent quite ape? Did God make the dinos?
Dont get me wrong, I'm a christian, i believe in God, and i have enough faith in God to believe in evolution, not creationism. I believe God created the environment in which the Earth has evolved on its own.
Man wrote the Bible, Man, who is imperfect and error-prone, and who has evolved over time to be what we are today.
The Illusionist, hello to you, I didn't know the XTC song, but I LOVE it! Thanks for posting it here.
Jim, this is also not my own material, but it's a another classic and funny riposte to Christianianity. It's an open letter to the appalling Dr Laura Schlessinger.
Jim, your ridiculously lame "The fool says in his heart, "There is no God" ... Psalm 53" put me in mind of it.
The point being that the Bible is full of nonsense. Why take any of it seriously when so much of it is laughable ...
Here
Let's be conservative and say there are 100 religions in the world all of which believe they are THE real religion. Well, that means 99 have to be wrong and only one can be right. Which one is right? My bet is all 100 are wrong! For the most part your religion and beliefs are governed by your indoctrination as a child, particularly with the biggie religions. If Jews and Muslims were born a few miles to the east or west, they would be in the "opposing" camp. Nothing magic going on here, just humans being humans.
Hey Jim, if we're all 'ignorant humans', then what exactly does that make YOU?
What claims do you have to enlightenment?
Thank you Jim! All these scientists keep trying to use their "facts" and "reality" to justify evolution. Well guess what... I've got a book that was written 2,000 years ago by ancient people that refutes all their "evidence." Preach on!
"Which takes more faith, the belief that God created us or that the earth "Magically" appeared and we happened to evolve over millions of years from
non-living organisms? "
I think it takes more faith to believe that science teaches that we evolved from "non-living " organisms when clearly it says we evolved from living organisms. What a moron you are!
Great blog as for me. I'd like to read more about this topic.

Having finished Braid this week in the Monthly Game Club, we're left with many questions about the meaning of the game. One thing is certain, however: Braid stands as a profound example of the quality and polish possible in the world of independent games, and the level of intelligence possible in all video games, independent or otherwise. Jonathan Blow, the developer and designer of the game, was kind enough to answer a few questions for us on being an independent game developer, the role of interactivity in games, and the inspiration for Braid.
_________________________________________________
Your game was independently made, but first released on Xbox Live Arcade. Would you share a few thoughts with us on being an independent game designer working with a huge corporation like Microsoft?
Whenever dealing with a company like this, you usually work with a (relatively) small division. I don't really know what kinds of politics goes on there, because for the most part Microsoft is good at isolating developers from that. Usually I would be dealing with just 1 or 2 people, and spending most of my time making the game. Because they had done a lot of Arcade titles before Braid, they did a pretty good job of ushering games through the approval and certification process with minimal BS. I did have one episode late in development where someone on the Microsoft side who I had never talked to decided to monkey with the game at the last minute in an unexpected way, and that was a very negative experience, but ultimately I decided to go ahead and release the game on XBLA anyway. Largely, though, it was a hands-off experience: my job was to make a good game, and the job of the guys I talked to at Microsoft was to help me get that game onto their service.
How do you think services like Xbox Live Arcade, Playstation Network, and WiiWare are affecting the independent gaming world?
It's definitely a positive thing that independent game developers have these places to sell games where they can find a large audience and where the piracy rate is relatively low -- it means that it's much more feasible now to make a living as an independent developer than it was 10 years ago.
Braid has been cited as an example in the continued debate about whether video games can be art. What do video games need to do to be taken seriously as an artistic medium?
All that needs to happen is for game developers to do more-serious work. The appreciation will come from that, naturally. Right now, the work isn't there. Most of what we do as an industry is about pandering and infantilism. If enough of us just stop doing that, we will find that there is an audience out there that takes us seriously.
How does interactivity change the ways ideas or stories are explored?
It just leads to the contemplation of a different field of ideas than something like film or music does. I can't say how that is "changed" from another medium because they aren't necessarily related that closely. There are connections, sure, but each one is in its own right a wide and deep body of stuff that can't be easily summarized. That's why we use these media to explore these things! If I can just say what the point is, then we don't need games in the first place.
Braid uses a number of innovative game mechanics; did the story inspire the gameplay, or vice versa?
The whole thing came to mind at roughly the same time. I would say that maybe the gameplay idea came first, by a very thin hair, but it was a very general idea -- that the way time behaves would change from world to world, though I didn't know what those behaviors would be, and in fact had very different ideas about these time behaviors initially than what ended up in the game. But as soon as I had that concept, I knew that I wanted the game to be done in the tradition of Italo Calvino's book Invisible Cities and Alan Lightman's book Einstein's Dreams, and that there would be textual pieces introducing each world.
One thing a number of people have said, when being critical of the game, is that they wish that the story parts happened in cut-scenes or were otherwise integrated into the gameplay. When they say this, I detect some kind of sentiment that, hey, now that we *can* have cut-scenes or pieces of story dribbled to us during the primary gameplay (as in Bioshock), that these are the only valid way to do things, that somehow text is obsolete. But that is a bit silly. The book has not gone away, and the way subjects are explored in literature are different than how they happen in dialogue or in pictures. It's a different medium, it has a different grain, and it's perfectly valid to use that grain if you want to. (And if a designer does not know this fact, then he is going to work with an incomplete toolbox!)
From the very first day, Braid was conceived as a videogame with its story presented in the tradition of a few books that I respect, and maybe a film or two.
Do you have any advice for aspiring independent game developers?
The most important thing is to make games and get them done. The second most important thing is to ensure that those games are the best things that you can make, whatever that means to you. Unfortunately these two goals are in conflict.
Would you like to share with us what you're working on now?
Every time I answer this question, it's something different. I have four different games that I have taken to the prototype stage since finishing Braid. I keep changing my mind about which game is really my next project, so I would just be misleading you if I gave a concrete answer here!

Reflections with Jonathan Blow
Oh, I want to hang out with him. He mentioned Alan Lightman! Also he made this game, which is pretty neat.
Invisible Cities as a game inspiration!? Damnit, I guess I should catch up and check out this game...
As a sidenote, a couple games that might be interesting to check out, whenever there is an open slot in the Monthly Game Club, are the works of Jason Rorher (Passage, Gravitation, and Between) and possibly Zeno Clash (let me look into the game more before I solidly recommend it)
this was an interesting piece. If anyone is interested in Blow's work or hearing him talk about games, I would also recommend the NYU game center podcasts he has a discussion of his game background and also a a sit-down with Frank Lantz. It's good stuff.
From what I can glean of his words around the Internet in interviews and blogs and such, he always comes off as more than a little... high-and-mighty, I suppose.
Still, I can't deny that I did absolutely love Braid, after all.
It seems to me that if you've made a game as good and successful as Braid, you sort of have the right to speak with authority on these subjects. I certainly would like to see more of the games industry heed his advice.

Candid photo from Anne Frank. One of my favorite memories ever. This is Morgan and Sarah and we were supposed to be in dress rehearsal but obviously we’re having more fun out of character. I miss this so much. And I adored the outfit (minus the Anne Frank hair) Lisa had me in for this scene and I adore Morgan’s outfit he looks so adorable and so does Sarah! Let’s face it, we’re pretty great ;)

Hi! I have no idea. I unfortunately could not print them… That is very odd. I have yet to come across that… Things get more and more complicated all the time with coupons.. I am having a great day when all 3 of the major coupon supplies work for me. Red Plum works great for me now, but Smartsource is giving me fits…
Thursday, January 24th 2013 at 3:11 PM |
FYI: I tried to print these coupons from my other computers and it already recognized that I had printed them. I think because I have the same printer for all computers so it saw that one registered? I don’t have any other printers so I couldn’t try to change my default printer.

We have been trained over the years to always look for the "great deals". Sometimes though, you get what you pay for. I don't think I would trust just anyone working on a car as sophisticated as a Prius.

I'm now thinking this is also my problem. Bought a 2004 from an insurance auction. Took a deer to the hood. Bought an aftermarket condenser. Did all the repair work before swapping in the new condenser. Now when its on Max both low and high side pressures are up to high. Found that if I tend the temp and keep the fan speed medium or just one above it does cool good and the pressures are in range. Takes longer to cool the car but its been effective even on 104 degree day. Need to buy a oe condeser to fix it. Will just have to suck it up and buy one. Thanks for all the great info you've been posting here!

Fort Bragg Staff Sgt faces attempted murder charges in police stand-off
FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. — Jan 16 2012
A Fort Bragg soldier is facing 30 charges after exchanging gunfire with police and barricading himself in his apartment for hours Friday night and Saturday morning.
Staff Sgt. Joshua P. Eisenhauer is charged with 15 counts of attempted first-degree murder, six counts of felony assault on a law enforcement official and nine counts of felony assault on a government official.
Eisenhauer was listed in critical condition after the gunfire exchange.
Two Fayetteville Police officers were also injured during the standoff with the soldier at an apartment complex, according to a police spokesman.
Ft. Bragg Saturday morning identified the soldier as Staff Sgt. Joshua P. Eisenhauer. He was assigned to Fort Bragg’s Warrior Transition Battalion. That’s a unit for wounded soldiers or soldiers transitioning out of the military, according to a Ft. Bragg spokesman.
Fayettevile police spokesman Gavin MacRoberts said Eisenhauer was in critical but stable condition at UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill.
In a 4 a.m. news conference spokesman MacRoberts said the injuries to the officers were “minor.” One officer has a cut to the head and the other has shrapnel in an arm.
The injuries are the result of a four-hour standoff that started with firefighters responding to a fire.
Firefighters arrived to the Austin Creek Apartment complex on 71st School Road around 10 p.m.
While there was not a major fire at the complex, firefighters were not able to get into any of the apartments they were trying to respond to, so they called police for help.
Police said a man started shooting at them around 10:30 p.m. and that officers fired back. The man then went back into his apartment on the third floor.
Police cleared out people from nearby apartments and took them to the fire station across the street.
“It is definitely nerve-racking when you know loved ones are in a situation and no ones giving you information, you just know someone has been shooting,” said Trevor Jones.
As a result, members of the Emergency Response Team used explosives to take out the front door of the suspect’s apartment. They sent in a robot.
They found Eisenhauer on the kitchen floor and he was taken into custody around 2:10 a.m.
One of the officers was also taken to the hospital. The other was treated on the scene.
Because this was an officer-involved shooting, the State Bureau of Investigation will be investigating. The officers involved will be placed on administrative duty during the SBI investigation.
The names of the officers will be released after “proper notifications” have been made, according to MacRoberts.
Police shut down 71st School Road around the apartment complex for several hours.
“They wouldn’t tell me anything. They wouldn’t tell me anything. They wouldn’t tell me if my apartment’s OK or what’s going on,” said a woman named Karen who lives in the complex, but declined to give her last name.
Jonathan Saucier also lives in the complex. He left work early when he found out about the situation. His wife was home alone.
“I’m actually very worried. I can’t get to her, but what can I do?,” he said.
While he couldn’t get to his wife because of the police barricades, his wife was giving him updates by phone.
“She first told me she’d been hearing gunshots. Everyone was hanging out of the balcony looking what’s was going on,” he said.
Saucier said his wife heard the explosion when police blew open the suspect’s door.
“She said it was the loudest noise she’s heard since and it set off car alarms.”
The road re-opened to traffic just before 3 a.m.
“I am truly proud of the valiant conduct displayed by our safety and security personnel in response to this challenging situation,” said City Manager Dale Iman in a written statement Saturday. “I am grateful to the fire fighters who attempted to make the citizens who were displaced to our fire station as comfortable as possible.
The investigation into the incident is ongoing.
Jones lives directly below the suspect and said he was worried about his girlfriend. He also said Eisenhauer seemed like a quiet person.
Crisis Team negotiators tried unsuccessfully to contact Eisenhauer for several hours.

Yes - that means I REALLY dislike these changes even more than the last time around and want them to go away.
I will be talking to all my "contact suggestions" about this...
I think after this, Google-YouTube itself won't have many "contact suggestions" left - just enemies.

Method and Mission Statement
Productive Playhouse was founded on the idea that children’s programming could teach complex subjects in funny, entertaining ways. Parents should be able to offer their children serious learning, and fun enjoyable entertainment all in one! Writer/directors Harry Ralston and Tamara Stern began aligning with top children’s educators in several disciplines to develop series that offered deeper learning and skill building hidden in inventive visuals, stories and fun.
The company’s first reading series, Your Child Can Read, established this Productive Playhouse model of implementing a top expert’s teaching methodology into a series of fun playful episodes. Further series created explored other subjects, including counting, shapes and geometry, music and color theory, all delivered though songs, animated characters and PP’s resident bookworm puppet, Benji! New projects in development expand on the company approach to include a foreign language series for kids, a more-effective story-based exercise program to combat childhood obesity, a highly practical parenting how-to series, and a new therapeutic series for Autistic young adults. Our entertainment programming is focused on making kids laugh, and then learn a little bit about their world, in the same spirit that Bugs Bunny and Dr. Suess taught them.

It sounds like Revis Island could be closed this weekend.
Rich Cimini of ESPNNewYork.com reports that that “feeling around the Jets” is that Revis will miss at least one game. The injury isn’t believed to be overly serious, but the Jets surely want Revis fully healthy before testing him again.
The Jets head to Miami on Sunday night in a game New York needs to win to avoid a two game deficit in the AFC East. Brandon Marshall does not seem like a fun guy to cover with a balky hamstring.
If Revis sits out, the Jets could tempted to also rest him the following week against the Bills.
The way miami’s O is looking right now ,let him sit and get 100%..we dont need him in this one..
How cute that he hurt it chasing down Moss after he burned him. Maybe if you go to training camp you would be looser its an interesting way to look at it. Favre misses camp is noticeably uncomfortable. Revis gets burned must be a hamstring. He’ll be back this week he just couldnt be seen after Moss facialized him and Cro amazingly covered him even better than Revis! Hamstring is the biggest BS Ive heard since whatever comes out Favres mouth
As a Dolphins fan I actually want Revis to play. It is not a true test for your team if you’re not playing your rivals at full strength.
If he can’t go in the Dolphins game, I would definitely keep him out of the Bills game too.
Hamstring injuries linger and are the kind of injury that can worsen if not rested.
They don’t need him to shut down half the field against the Bills. Edwards will shut down the whole field all by himself.
If Revis sits out, the Jets could tempted to also rest him the following week against the Bills.
COULD BE
No need to proof read.. How do I get a job working for this site?
I feel like every Rosenthal article is an Easter Egg hunt to find the obligatory spelling/grammar error(s). See if you can find the F-up in this one!
Yeah, who needs training camp?
Gregg, I am guessing you don’t know much about the AFC East. You can’t take anyone lightly when it’s an AFC East battle. That goes for the Bills also. They will play us harder at their home, than against anyone else. This isn’t baseball where you can sit your stars for a game to recharge, because you think it’s an easy game.
Brandon Marshall sucks anyway.
Revis should be the lucky one… he don’t want it with Marshall
Just throw to Marshall every play with or without Revis
FIRST.
Marshall will have a field day against either Revis with a bum hammy/or Kyle Wilson.
I think Dolphins will pummel Sanchez at their home opener Sunday Night now that they have some confidence after handing Favre and ass whooping and Vontae emerging as a stud.
Dolphins Victory 20-10, and they finally will be recognized by the rest of the league as a true contender
Revis is the lucky one. Now he doesnt have to get bulldozed and take a beating from Marhsall and get shown up for being the overrated hype machine he is. He’s not even the best corner in the division. Vontae Davis is.
I’m not sure Moss or Welker were particularly lucky in the second half of last nights game with the Teddy P look-a-like sidelined….
Noooo, Marshall wants to face Revis. Dolphins have won 3 straight against the Jets with Revis playing, and the Patriots played worse when Revis left the game.
Wish he would play. Marshall would help all the clueless jests fan realize gilligan’s island is average at best. Overhyped and overrated. What do you expect from the stinking, lousy nyj???
That sucks, Def wanted towatch Marshall manhandle Mr. Revis.
Cro will do just fine against Marshall. Go ahead and say Marshall owned him back in the AFC West, but truth is anyone who plays a base Zone coverage against Marshall will be doomed. Marshall will get his usual for this season so far, but the rest of Dolphins offense will play considerably worse( if thats at all possible). Henne will be pressured, Ronnie/Ricky will be bottled up. This will be a low scoring game, as Miami’s D is serious. I have to give credit when its due, Vontae is a heck of football player. Throw in Wake, Dansby, Starks, and you got yourself a Top 5 D, very impressive. The key to this game will be if Sanchez can build off his nearly flawless performance against the Pats. I doubt he will but still think the Jets will pull this one out in a VERY close one. Can’t wait for this one!!
Didn’t Vontae Davis injure himself celebrating yesterday?! LOL yeah totally afraid of that guy
Boy , you’d think by reading this fanbases B.S rants on here Miami was scoring 30 points a game these 1st 2 games, NE could only muster up 14 points ,what you think we’ll hold your amenic offense too..
Dolphins will win either way. Marshall will make some plays, but it is the Miami running game that the Jets can’t stop.
Miami 13 Jets 6
Wow that should be fun to watch!
Kravon
Revis or not, the fins will run over the jests. Fins will run right at JT and his boo boo elbow. The beast will get his catches. By the end of the season the corner everyone will be talking about is Vontae Davis.
Way to over pay Jets!
Why would Brandon Marshall be considered lucky? Randy Moss was completely shut down AFTER Revis left the game.
“If Revis sits out, the Jets could tempted to also rest him the following week against the Bills.”
Let him play and play badly…. ALL we hear are excuses from gag green anyway.
Marshall will eat him up or crow which should be funny to watch.
Miami will run ALL over the hapless wets per usual. 3-0 bank it!

Actually a good point. The biggest hole on the Jets will be the NT, which the Dolphins will much rather exploit that Marshall having massive day.

He did, but he’s fine, played well after that. He isn’t on Revis’s level but he’s no “slouch”.
JetFaninMiami – was that a hilarious grammatica moment or what?
dbess – what kind of loser posts “FIRST” in a comments thread?
a miami doll-fan.
GO GANG GREEN
I guess you blow hole fans havent figured out that Mr. Marshall is no good if the ball doesnt get to him. If your offense is that one dimensional you need not worry about Revis…you got bigger fish to fry..(no pun intended)…and your gonna have to put up more than 14-17 points. You dont have a Wes Welker either. Cromarti can handle it……When Revis is healthy Marshall isnt going to burn him deep,nor is anyone else for that matter.
See you on the field,until then,you havent earned any braggin rights.
Jet fans are crazy if you think u don’t need revis. The dolphins weren’t showing anything offensivly the first two games because they are saving it for this week. The jets have nothing on game film to prepare for, so when Sunday night comes the jets are going to get hit right in the mouth. Good luck against the blitz sanchez cam wake is coming for you
@JetFan in Miami
Vontae Davis is more of a complete CB that anyone on your team…
As far as him injuring himself, I’ll take a stinger after laying a big hit on a TE than pulling a hamstring getting burned for 6 any day
means cromartie will cover him which is wut ended moss’s day n they will blitz less zone more henne will have to check down more to fasano wildcat will be in trouble this week
Dolphins suck anyways. Can’t believe these chumps are saying they are “true contenders’ and Vontae Davis is the best cb in the afc east. Give me a break. Your team is a joke. Cromartie will be fine on Marshall. See you on Sunday.
Cromartie is built for guys likie moss and marshall big tall lanky wrs who can’t run a solid route except a streak down the sidline.hense why welker blew him up and then cro shut moss down for the rest of the game forcing a pick and having his own. By the way cro is on course for 16 picks this season lol. Were gonna stuff you guys like we stuffed both these teams in the run and were gonna shut down ur one reciever, then force your joke QB to throw because if it wasn’t for one long pass on sheppard ( who sucks believe me I watched him all last season) your offense was pitiful you could barely win with favre trying to hand the game to you guys. Sanchez to keller all day next week and there’s nothing you can do about it.
Chad Henne would have to be capable of throwing for more than 115 yds in a game for Marshall to have a big day.

Proofread is one word. You’re Fired!
Jets should expect trouble this week against Marshall. but lets stop the conspiracy theory that Revis is faking injury. This is a guy looking to already line up another huge payday. He is as confident as it gets and would have no fear going against Marshall if he was crazy enough to call out Moss, whos much better than Marshall is.
The problem is this guy has a hamstring problem because he missed all of training camp due to being a greedy D-bag. He isnt in football shape and the hint for everyone should have been the Jets lining him up away from Boldin at the end of the Ravens game. This is what happens when you dont come to camp.
The Jets probably have enough on defense anyway to win the game, but coming from a guy who has Brandon Marshall on my fantasy team, I would expect a big week out of the guy. way to go Revis. Next time spend your offseason getting ready to play instead of waiting around for a raise
I wish he would play. I don’t want the Jersey Jets to have any excuses for the beatdown coming !!!
Did anyone take a close look at what Revis did when Moss burned him for that TD? As he’s running into the end zone he grabs his “right” hamstring for just a second, and then as if by some crazy twist of fate, he then goes for the left one. I guess in the heat of the moment (the embarrassing one) he forgot which hammy was supposed to be injured. And the Oscar goes to…
I’d be worried about the Dolphins if they had a QB that was any good. Henne sucks and Marshall will have little impact. The Dolphins are the worst 2-0 in the NFL right now. They played down to the level of the Bills in week One and the Vikings blew 3 great chances to score TD’s. Sanchez is CLEARLY the 2nd best QB in the division.
Jets will spank the finns….MN beat them all over the place but the turnovers killed them again….
Who cares, what was Miami’s record vs New York last year and how many of those games did Revis miss. Doesn’t seem like he makes that big a difference to me.
SSSSWWWWEEEEPPPPP!
The Dolphins offense has not looked very good these first two weeks. The Jets are not the team to try to turn things around offensively on. That said, this is a division game and they are always tough no matter who plays. The defenses look very good and one of them will probably score…and that could be the difference in a low scoring game.
Yes, the lack of training camp is responsible for Revis’s hammy and Favre’s looking uncomfortable in the offense, because no one who went to training camp pulled anything or is having trouble getting into a rhythm.
Idiots.
to all you mn fans in denial. the dolphns spanked you guys. we only needed to throw the ball 15 times to do it too. talkin about how henne sucks. what qb can put up great stats with only 15 attempts? you guys “blew it” 3 times? no our D spanked you 3 times (when your O has to go for it on 4th down 3 times in a game and doesnt convert, thats not you guys blowing it, thats you guys getting served) give me a break, anyone that watched that game knows the fins were handling it from drive one, they are the ones that almost blew it.
soft serve sanchez is gonna look like a deer in headlights sunday night. 5 sacks. he may or may not nurse his knee and sit out a couple plays, or an entire half, or the entire season too
Marshalll when covered by Cro last 2 years in AFC West= 9 targets, 7 catches, 74 yards, 1 TD in 4 games. He may have owned the Chargers, but not Cro. All this talk about Marshall is funny to even mention, the Jets D just dominated the most prolific offense in the history of the NFL circa 2007 that has only added talent to it since then(minus holdout Mankins), not even to mention the fact that the Jets themselves were minus Revis, Jenkins & Pace! BTW, Pace will be on the field this weekend so hold onto that ball tight Ronnie/Ricky!
Even a busted clock is right twice a day. Last week was sanchez first time to be right this season. So he has one more chance.
Gotta agree with Finfan68 on this one.
Oh, one more thing, let’s see if Sanchez can make those throws when you actually have a pass rush to worry about.
I think it will be a good game. We didn’t have a Moss or Welker or Marshall last year and it didn’t stop us from beating you do those comments are just garbage.
Fireman Ed loves hog
Bleedsgreen: they haven’t had to show anything. They have never trailed and they were on the road. At home it will be a different story. Henne had 3, 300 yard games last year. All when they were trailing. Just wait. It’s hard to prepare for an offense when all you have seen this year is vinilla. P.s. Henne’s record vs. The yets 2-0
“The Beast” will RULE Beavis….let him play!
The Jets are not worried about Miami well how did Revis fare last year against us, not very good. Even Ted Ginn burned him and he was not even a real receiver. Imagine what Marshall is going to do to that terrible secondary, just watch the Ravens tape. Last year Miami physically beat up the Jets on that Sunday night, they went down the field and pushed the Jets around to win the game. Anyone that watched Hard Knocks saw that the Jets are an undisciplined team from their overeating coach to their no character players. Please put Cromartie (and even his 10 kids) out there on Marshall and blitz we will put up 40 points on you.
Hey NewYorkSachexchange2010, Pace was on the field last year for both your loses to us wasn’t he??? Sanchez is a joke of a QB especially when he has pressure and he will see pressure on Sunday. Favre has seen everything and he threw 3 picks imagine what deer in the headlights Sanchez will do against our pressure and secondary. Cromartie is terrible, nice pickup there, hope your owner is not supporting all her illegitimate kids. The only thing Cromartie can cover is women. LOL.
“Cromartie is built for guys likie moss and marshall big tall lanky wrs who can’t run a solid route except a streak down the sidline.”
Obviously a loud-mouthed Jet fan who doesn’t have a real opinion on Marshall but would still like to throw out a generalization.
If you think Marshall is someone who streaks down the sideline — and you’ve actually seen him play — then you don’t know how to make sense out of what you’re watching.
Jets are now on the hook for a $16million + average cb for the rest of the year. Hamstring injuries only heal with weeks of rest…many weeks.
“The Jets probably have enough on defense anyway to win the game”
They were the #1 defense a year ago and couldn’t pull out a win. What changed? Oh yeah, the Phins replaced Ginn with Marshall.
I’ll take that change any day.
Forget it. Fish aren’t nearly as good as the Patriots and the Jets b*&%tch slapped them all over the Meadowlands.
Fish got no offense. Realistically, there is no way Fish score over 10 pts vs. stout Jets defense and Henne may not live thru the entire game.
How great will it be when Jason Taylor sacks henne on Sunday Night!
Then we will hear ALL OF THE EXCUSES why the Fish lost the game.
Rex predicts SWEEP of the Fish in 2010, lets get it started in our 2nd home in South Beach.
wouldnt revis island be open instead of closed?
I have to admit I was upset when Jason Allen was named a starter over Smith…but he has been awesome. Nolan’s defensive schemes have placed Miami players in position to make big plays…they already have 3 picks (should be 5 but two were called back via penalties away from the ball) they have forced 3 fumbles and recoverd 1 for a touchdown. They also DROPPED 2 pick-6s. The defense has put pressure on the QB also. Smith has talent but has never been seen as the sharpest knife in the drawer. I don’t care for Sapp (how does a DB get an offsides penalty to DQ an INT) and I hope Smith can play nickel on keller (height needed there). Both defenses have played very well. Miami has not thrown that much and I expect they will throw more often on Sunday…home field (finally) should help a little. One thing that I see coming against the Jets aggressive defense…Ronnie Brown will throw from the wildcat and catch them off guard for a big play or two. Great rivalry with some of the greatest games…hopefully there will be another epic battle with the Dolphins getting the win and finally getting some well earned respect.
Missed you all last week bleedinggay, gang gay, and jcyets! Welcome back!
It’s great to see all the delusional, inbred Jests fans out again!
Now take your stupid asses back into hiding after the Fins show you how it’s done. You guys all jump up and talk trash this week about how the Fins are going to need more than 14 points to beat the YETS, but it seems to me that you only scored 9 points against a defense that wasn’t born in the 90′s! The Ravens shut you down, and the Dolphins are going to do the same. You think SanCHEESE’s game against the Ravens was ANEMIC (that’s for you nyYets31 – write it down) against Ray Lewis and the Ravens, wait until Dansby, Wake, MISI, and Odrick (if he’s healthy) get a hold of you!
I can’t wait until the average IQ of this site goes back up when the Fins spank your sorry asses and all the Yets fans shut up and go back to masturbating with old Broadway Joe photos.
Yeah, the same Broadway Joe that isn’t even drinking the local kool-aid on that chump filled OTHER team from NY.
J – E – T – S SUCK SUCK SUCK!!!!!!!
“By the way cro is on course for 16 picks this season lol.”
And the Miami D is on pace to average 3 sacks and 3+ turnovers per game.
“The dolphins weren’t showing anything offensivly the first two games because they are saving it for this week.
this could be the single stupidest comment i’ve seen today. congratulations Fizz.”
Yeah, it’s not like Miami did exactly that 2 years ago against NE or anything… (Don’t think it’s an accurate comment but certainly your comment is stupider than the parent.)
I would think Jets fans would be prepared for the unexpected after last year. Miami hadn’t been racking up the points last year either but then Henne had a field day, Ginn had like his only successful bomb for a TD, the TEs and Bess moved the chains all night, and Ronnie slammed the Wildcat down your throat to end Monday night. Then when you stopped the Fins offensively and defensively, Sanchez played up to his true capabilities and gave us the game with a bit of help from that 3rd, nonexistent phase of the game known as special teams. The Fins can be a low scoring grinder, they can keep pace with a high flyer, they can let a team march up and down the field but never get in the end zone, they can be a front runner or come from behind. Wouldn’t make much of what you seen in two games.
“See you on the field,until then,you havent earned any braggin rights.”
Looks at last years Miami-Jets record, looks at this season’s records for both teams, wonders what the Jets have to be bragging about…
Oh, and welcome back to you GayAsAss. Nice to see you’re still alive, and completely stupid.
Where were you last week after that loss? All piled in a room with the rest of the self sucking Yets fan base I assume?
It’s too bad the Jets section of this website doesn’t have as many readers as the Dolphin’s seems to. It’s just like living here in South Florida New Yorkers, you talk like you own the place, but you don’t really belong here. That’s why 95 runs North as well as South.
“MN beat them all over the place but the turnovers killed them again….”
Did you watch the game? The only thing that made it close was Miami’s fumbles in horrible field position. In the first half and into the 3rd, Miami would frequently get into good enough field position on 2nd and short so they would try to pound the middle because that’s what they like to do (demoralize and soften up a defense). They had already had success running to the edges and passing and their defense was in control, so they could elect to pound it and play field position. Even without much offense in the second half, all they had to do to win the game was regain the field position battle that the 2 fumbles very briefly put them behind on. At no point yesterday, could anyone sense any urgency from the Fins to put up 35 points … because they aren’t the Patriots.
Miami fans are the lowest common denominator
“You know damn well that the vikes were the best team on the field yesterday…”
A team that gets inside the 25 yard line of the opponent 7 times and never scores a TD, a team that’s stopped twice on 4th and short to take control of the game, a team that needs to be given the ball on the 2.5 yard line to get into the end zone… such a team is never the best team on the field.
How has nobody mentioned this juicy little nugget?
Cromartie once gave up 18 catches to Brandon Marshall in one game.
Yeah, Marshall will be just as lucky as Moss was in the second half yesterday. He must be on his knees thanking the Lord for his good fortune.
Trash talk never put a W in the win collumn. Dolphins are going to win.
At around 11:30 Sunday Night a reporter will ask JT what Henne looks like and Taylor will reply, “I have no idea”.
i am going to laugh my ass off when the dolphins come out on the first series sunday night with henne in the shotgun and 4 wr on the field, and then just start airing it out every play. the look on rex ryans fat face with his horse teeth will be priceless.
i love how all the jet fans talk about our offense where had 1 lucky game by sanchez and no running game this year also vontae jason and yeremiah will dominate sanchez who had 1 lucky game and henne will unleash like he did last year towards the end like 4 straghit 300yd games and ow many has sanchez had and also ive never seen henne throw for 70yds against a bad secondary so a fuc off pussies
maybe marshall has been average with cromartie but he had a 18catch 160+yds and a TD but he who got sweeped last year did i see revis get burned by GINN i think so and now marshall good luck fagits
This guy is averaging 6 catches, 62 yards and 0 TDs per game……and that includes one 46 yard catch….
I don’t see why the Jets should be concerned.
dolfanSS thats great but the only time he saw henne was when he killed the jets on monday night
2 playoff appearances in 10 years….both losses and you dolfags keep running your mouths…..thats what is hilarious
Hate to say it but the jets will win this game! the dolphins barely beat the horrid vikes after favre gift wrapped 4 TOs. for them. NO chance for fins to win.
I hope the Jets and all their fans pass away.
It doesn’t matter! We saw how Bouldin and Moss peed on that “Island”. So his hammy got bad!!!
To the rest – keep saying that Fins will loose. Everybody was saying we can win with Vikes.
@myrek2008 – Boldin (who’s last name has no u in it) wasn’t covered by Revis for a single snap in the Baltimore game, so I really don’t think you know what you’re talking about. Boldin went off because he was covered mainly by the rookie Kyle Wilson. Moss played well against Revis, but Revis already had his injured hammy going into last week, made it worse on that Moss TD, and now isn’t playing for two weeks. If that was a BS injury someone was trying to use for an excuse as to how he played, why would he simply not play against the other two division rivals? further, Randy Moss is a top 3 WR in the league right now, with a top 3 QB throwing to him. Miami doesn’t have either luxury. Cromartie shut down Moss in the second half, and he’ll do the same to Marshall.
The Dolphins will lose because they won’t be able to put up numbers on offense. Sanchez is coming off a great week in which he threw 3 TD’s. and he STILL has no interceptions (while I know that Henne hasn’t thrown one either, he has only 1 TD between two games). The Dolphins defense has seen the Bills, who I wouldn’t expect to score more than 10 points against anybody, and the Vikings, who have terrible offensive line play and a QB who’s still shaking out some cobwebs. They also don’t have their #1 receiver (or a decent receiver to fill in for him). Am I impressed with their defense? Nope. The Offense? Definitely not. They don’t even have their bail-out package, Ted Ginn Jr, who single-handedly won the game for them in the Meadowlands last year, when the Jets were kicking the Dolphins @sses up and down the field on offense and defense. LT is averaging 6.3 yards per carry. Dustin Keller averages 14.2 yards per catch. Cromartie has 2 picks in 2 games. The Jets are ready to go. Everyone is saying “oh, the dolphins have their number,” well you think the Jets are gonna walk into a game against the team whose fans talk the MOST sh*t about the Jets of anybody in the NFL? Come on now. Both teams are gonna be amped, it’ll be fun to watch, and the Jets are coming out on top.
