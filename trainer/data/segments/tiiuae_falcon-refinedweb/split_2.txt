The French rightly pride themselves on having inspired American remakes like “the Dinner for Schmucks” and “True Lies.” They also rightfully complain that Americans always spoiled the artistic touch in the original movies. For once the roles are reversed in real life and not on cinema reels. The French remake being shot now in Mali of the 2003 ‘Mission Accomplished” flick starring George W. Bush does not, thus far, show any promise of improving on the American original action drama.
Credit should be given when due, Mr Hollande’s decision to put boots on the ground is a responsible choice– better late than never. However, the real question today is: does France have a credible exit strategy that does not result in another botched war in Northern Mali? President Hollande’s PR-minded visit to Mali’s liberated north along with the nation’s interim President Dioncounda Traoré felt like a an eery replay of George W. Bush’s infamous “Mission Accomplished” moment aboard a US aircraft carrier. While Mr Hollande and his host were prudent not to declare the fight against Jihadis over, they had more rhetoric than concretes to offer as an assessment of the current situation. Most media stories reported the event without really questioning the next phases in the conflict.
Just as in 2003, Hollande echoed Bush’s pledges of grandiose plans for rebuilding Iraq. Like the images of Iraqis tearing down Saddam’s statue in 2003, footage of effusive and jubilant locals praising Mr Hollande and their liberators has been rolling on cable news channels around globe. A weak and temporary fill-in until Mali resumes its democratic regime interrupted by military coups, Mr Taroré did not have much to say about reconciliation with the North other than a vague willingness to negotiate with the MNLA. Behind the smiles, and the photos ops, no concrete plan seems to exist to fix Mali’s multidimensional failures.
On the security front, the draw down of France’s 3000 troops has already been decided. the official line is that ECOWAS troops will support Malian troops hereon forward. The United States has pledged $10 Million Dollars to help train Mali’s army. this being the same army that melted in battle last winter when Jihadis took it head on, one cannot help but wonder whether this check is a buy-out option from a hopeless task? Whatever the answer is, it is imperative that the Malian army be continuously supervised lest its undisciplined troops engage in yet another round of vigilante retribution against civilians they deem to be in cahoots with the enemy.
As of January 20, only 450 out of the 4500 ECOWAS troops pledged were already on Malian soil. Almost half are from Chad, the rest are spread between Nigeria, Niger, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Benin and Togo. Of course, the devil is in the details; Benin sent policemen, and Ghana sent combat engineers — neither are exactly frontline combat troops. Of course, these numbers increased in the last 10 days but the questions remain valid: other than Nigeria’s and Chad’s troops, how soon can we expect that this mishmash can be forged into a credible fighting force?
Speaking of mishmash and cultural references, experience in Iraq and Afghanistan show that any foreign troops have a very short time window to adapt to local cultures and traditions. Sub-saharan troops are not an exception to this rule. Just as their Western counterparts in the past decade, they are entering into an alien culture whose intricacies and codes they must quickly grasp or risk being seen by locals as a serious nuisance in their lives. After all, who could forget how quickly Iraqis’ shouts of “Thank you America” turned into “down down America”?
Conspicuously absent when the going got rough, Europe’s leaders seem all too content to have dodged another war they could avoid. Of course, they pledged 50 Million Euros to fund the African contingent being deployed in Mali and to send trainers. Decidedly, the European Union is a coalition of the amnesiacs. over a decade, Western European nations diligently filled terrorist coffers with ransom money to free EU hostages. Way above the $100 Million mark, that money went a long way in helping Jihadis buy arms and train future terrorists. Consequently, the onus of showing responsible leadership remains on EU member countries. They should, at least, triple their financial and military assistance to France. if not for their own security, it is a step on the way to repair the damage their policies caused to Mali and the region’s security. Their credibility and commitment to combat international terrorism depends on it.
With Jihadis melting in nature, and quickly disappearing in the depth of the Sahara, France, African nations, and the world at large are better served by some candor: there are not enough troops on the ground. Mr Hollande does not yet have an exit strategy, Mali’s military and governance require years to rebuild. After the joy recedes, the people freshly liberated in northern Mali will be expecting all the rosy promises made to them to be fulfilled. For that to happen, the international community should follow France’s lead and shoulder its part of the responsibility. Anything short of a full Bosnia-style UN mission in northern Mali can not be a serious response to a an equally serious problem. For the sake of peace, we can only hope that today l’impossible n’est pas Français!

Washington, DC—Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today after the U.S. Senate voted to advance the housing reform bill for a final-passage vote tomorrow:
“After months of Republican stalling, we are finally moving forward on the bipartisan housing bill, and are looking forward to passing it tomorrow. This bill is the most sweeping housing legislation the Congress will have passed in decades. It addresses the root of the broader economic crisis – record-high foreclosures – by helping Americans keep their homes and keep their home equity. Even President Bush has finally dropped his stubborn opposition to this important bill and finally realizes, as Democrats long have, that we must act immediately to address the housing crisis.”

Find a Dentist in Southington, OH:
If You Need A Good Dentist in Southington These Tips Will Help You Find One
Having healthy teeth is one reason why having a good dentist is so important. Dental care that is high quality can't be substituted, even though lots of things can be done, such as brushing and flossing on a consistent basis. There will be times when you might need a root canal or a cavity filled, and these will happen even when you are careful. There are ways for you to find the best dentist for your needs, and this article will help you.
Call (888) 985-5898 to be connected with a pre-qualified dentist in Southington.
When you are hoping to seek out a dentist, you should visit at least a few different offices in your local are thinking of trying out a dentist one of the best ways to do this is to schedule a cleaning and a checkup. This will help you gauge how comfortable you feel both with the dentist and with the office as a whole. A lot of people won't try to find a dentist until they are suffering from big problems like massive toothaches. In this case, you may have to find someone who has an open appointment in the near future. When it's possible, though, you need to choose a dentist before you are faced with an emergency. You may be trying to find a dentist you can see for the regular things like whitening and checkups. On the other hand, you may need a specialist for certain things. When your teeth need orthodontics, for example, hiring a specialist is the way to go. If you've already got a regular dentist, ask him to recommend a good specialist for what you need. When you want to find a new dentist, look for a bigger office with multiple services so you won't be forced to travel for separate procedures. There are some medical offices that will even have doctors, chiropractors, etc in addition to dentists all within one office and under one roof.
Depending on what the staff at the dental office is like, that's what your experience will be. You have to call the office for scheduling an appointment and deal with them while you are there, even if the dentist is your primary focus. All the workers in the office should not only be professional in their attitude, but also polite. It is not a good sign when the office staff is abrasive or rude because they reflect on the dentist you are thinking about choosing. When a staff is nice, you have a lot more confidence dealing with them if an emergency comes up where you have to call the office. The dentist will probably also have at least one assistant, and this is also someone who will have an impact on your experience.
Call (888) 985-5898 to be connected with a pre-qualified dentist in Southington.
There are quite a few factors to consider when choosing a dentist, from the cost to the location to the dentist's reputation and experience. It's also a matter of finding someone who makes you feel comfortable when you have a potentially painful procedure scheduled. Dental health should never be underestimated for importance, especially when you are in need of a new dentist, so the above guidelines should help.

It wasn't pretty, but the Boise State Broncos defeated the BYU Cougars on Thursday night, 7-6, and with the victory the Broncos remain No. 24 in this week's Associated Press Top 25 Poll.
The Alabama Crimson Tide continue their stronghold on the No. 1 position in the poll, with the Oregon Ducks jumping the LSU Tigers to grab the No. 2 spot this week. LSU's less-than-impressive win over Auburn is the cause of the slide, though the Tigers still did garner one first place vote. Florida State and Georgia round out the Top 5 this week.
Three new undefeated teams jumped into the AP Poll this week: Oregon State at No. 18, Rutgers at No. 23, and Baylor at No. 25.

Most everyone recognizes the red berries that probably showed up beside the turkey on the dinner table last month, but probably few would recognize the plant that produces these tasty little morsels. It may surprise you to know that this same attractive, diminutive, glossy leaved shrub that bears the fruit that has become an American tradition makes a beautiful, evergreen, easy groundcover with all the attributes of a first class garden plant: ornamentally pleasing, hardy, dependable, easy to propagate, low to no maintenance and four seasonal interest. There is one drawback. At the present it is hard to find a source since nurserymen in Georgia only started propagating it for sale in the last year or so. It is, however, offered by some mail order and specialty nurseries and probably by the spring of l998, it will be more readily available to the public.
Most of us in Georgia haven’t encountered this little jewel because the closest its natural range comes to Georgia is in the mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina. Found in the wild in acid sphagnum bogs from Newfoundland to Minnesota and southward to the mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina, this member of the Ericaceae family is a close relative of the blueberry, which is, of course, in the same genus. Vaccinium is the ancient name of the blueberry and macrocarpon refers to the large fruit. Cranberry is a corruption of craneberry, the name colonist gave the plant because the flowers are shaped like the head and neck of a crane. The berries were so prized by the colonist that early Massachusetts’ history records a gift of l0 barrels of cranberries shipped to King Charles II. Because the berries remained on the shrub throughout the winter and also could be stored for up to a year, they were a very important staple in the diet of Native Americans also, and it is commonly thought that they introduced the pilgrims to the preparation of the fruit on the first Thanksgiving. They also used the berries that they called atoca, meaning “good fruit”, as a poultice for wounds, to cure stomach problems, as a diuretic, to lower fevers and to barter for food.
Description: American cranberry is a small, 6-8”, low growing evergreen shrub with slender, horizontal trailing stems which intermittently root at the nodes forming a mounding, dense groundcover of indefinite spread. The fine textured, evergreen leaves are simple, alternate, elliptic, entire and glabrous about l/2 to 3/4” long and not quite as wide. Their color is lustrous dark green in spring and summer, purple to burgundy, fall through winter. The horizontal stems are vegetative only, while the upright stems that grow from the leaf axils of the runners bear the small, bell shaped, pale pink flowers that look like miniature shooting stars. The blooms that start in May in the Atlanta area and go on intermittently throughout the summer are too small to be showy, but the recognizable red berry is very ornamental, starting out green in the summer, ripening in September-October to a rich, shiny red just in time to make it to the dinner table by Thanksgiving. Those that don’t, persist through the winter.
Cultivation:: Cranberries grown as ornamentals require much less exacting cultivation than the carefully produced commercial cranberry. You would expect it to require wet soil since it occurs naturally in bogs. Not so. The natural bogs are typically very wet with the spring rains but dry out in the summer and fall. Georgia has typically this same weather pattern. At the DeKalb College Botanical Garden we have found in the last three years that the cranberry shrub requires no more supplemental water than any other garden plant. What is does require is rich, organic, acid soil, full sun to very light shade and room for the runners to spread. We plant it in pure compost and add organic matter each year to keep the soil loose, rich and acid. By mulching with pine straw or bark, it can be kept as a 2-2 l/2’ shrub with the runners gracefully trailing on top of the mulch. For best results as a spreading ground cover forgo the pine straw or bark and allow the stems to root at the nodes spreading indefinitely. Plant it in the fall or early spring and treat it as any other shrub, giving it ample water until it is established. The speed by which it spreads can be hastened by fertilizing at regular intervals during the growing season.
Propagation:: While American cranberry can be grown from seed that has had a three month cold stratification period, cuttings are so easy and dependable that this is the usual method of propagation. To root it in a greenhouse environment, snip 6-l0” runner tips in late spring or summer, strip the bottom half of the tips of its foliage, dip in a rooting hormone and stick in sand or potting soil. Rooting usually takes place within a month. A handful of stems can be rooted altogether in the same hole. To root directly outside, use this same method. In late spring or early summer, gather a hand full of runner tips 8-l0” long, use a rooting hormone (dip and grow works fine), stick the whole handful in rich, moist, organic soil amended with creek sand and keep moist until roots are established.
Garden Use: The trailing stems of American cranberry which intermittently root at the nodes make it a natural for covering banks or any area where an evergreen low growing groundcover is needed. Plant it in masses or groups of 3-5 to edge a walk or driveway. Use it in front of course big leaf hollies or laurels for contrast. The horizontal growth habit of American Cranberry planted in front of the red upright ‘Rosy Glow’ Barberry is very interesting. Plant it near a Loropetalum ‘Burgundy’ to enhance the winter color of both. great in a rock garden or as an edging in a herb garden. Use it in containers alone or, even better, use it as the spilling edger in a large accent container filled with tall flowers or a shrub. The shiny dark stems trailing from a white window box in a sunny window would be gorgeous. Plant them as a crop around the perimeter of a vegetable garden to spruce it up. Wherever you plant it be generous and plant enough for you and the birds to enjoy.

The cookie-like crust for this tart comes together in a snap - it is simply made from rolled oats, granulated sugar and salt that are mixed in a food processor until the oats are finely ground. Chilled chunks of butter are added and after a couple tablespoons of icy water, the crust came together in no time. The best part of this dough? No rolling it out! You just scoop it into the bottom of a tart pan and use your hands to easily mash it over the bottom and up the sides.Since the filling is cooked in a saucepan, the crust does need to be fully baked before being filled.

Oh, yum. There is nothing better that strawberries and chocolate for dessert. I can't wait to make this!
"Swoon-worthy" -- I love your adjectives. I believe this would fit that perfectly. Beautiful, simply beautiful.
Erin - That is for sure... it is one of our favorite combinations!
Anj - Thank you!
Joe, this look very delicious! I am another fan of strawberries and chocolate together!
Is this from the new CL issue? I think I might have missed this one, but am now adding to my list ot make!
I love the idea of the oatmeal crust, it looks so good! (just love oats!)
The filling sounds like a chocolate pudding from your description, is it right? At first I thought it would be a ganache!
Nice tart, really pretty Joe!

I too raise my hand for choc and strawberries. Combining them in a tart is spectacular. Looks great.
It looks mouthwatering, Joe!
I love strawberries and they go so well with chocolate!
Joe, I so wish I had your presentation skills. Of course on this dessert it may not matter as I think I would dive into it fairly quickly. We have had a good batch of strawberries around here even at the regular grocery store. I think I will try this one this weekend.
What a beautiful presentation! Looks delicious too!
Ana - it is from the june issue! It is kind of like a pudding, but it is more firm like a custard!

If the video footage that you want to edit is on a tape you'll need to hook your camera or tape player into your computer. Plug in your camera's AC adapter so it stays powered while importing. Turn on the camera and put it in VTR or VCR mode (so that it plays video, instead of recording it). Now, connect the camera to the computer using a USB or FireWire cable.
From the Capture Video menu, select Capture from video device. This opens the Video Capture Wizard which you use to import video clips.
Using the controls on the camera, advance or rewind the tape to just a few seconds before the scene you wish to save. Play the tape, and press Start Capture when you want to begin saving to the computer. Hit Stop Capture when the scene is finished.
The video is saved as clips, in the proprietary Windows Media Format. The Capture Wizard lets you know how much video you have imported, in terms of time and file size. It also tells you how much space is left on the drive.

In May 1960, the former Nazi SS officer Adolf Eichmann was abducted by the Israeli Secret Service, strapped into a seat on an El-Al commercial flight and taken to Israel, where he would then be tried and sentenced to death for his instrumental role in the murder of six million Jews.
Eichmann began his career with the feared Nazi SS Sicherheitsdienst as a file clerk, constructing a detailed data base on Freemasons. Eventually, he was appointed director of the so-called Scientific Museum of Jewish Affairs, where he managed a massive extortion racket, extracting the wealth of Austrian Jews in exchange for their safe passage out of Austria. His subsequent recommendation for the deportation of European Jews to the island of Madagascar was not approved.
Eichmann served as recording secretary for the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, after which he was appointed transport administrator for the Final Solution. The former file clerk thereby became responsible for the collection, sorting and delivery of six million human “packages” to the death camps, a thanato-logistical network requiring both scrupulous attention to detail and absolute ideological commitment to the ultimate objective.
EICHMANN BOX: BULLET PROOF
In 1961, the distinguished political philosopher Hannah Arendt persuaded New Yorker magazine to assign her as correspondent for the trial, resulting in a series of reports that were later published as a book, Eichmann in Jerusalem with its resonant and provocative subtitle, A Report on the Banality of Evil. Arendt observed an unimpressive everyman sitting inside a bullet proof glass box. Fidgeting with a pencil and fiddling with his glasses, he looked to her like a postal clerk, a typical German civil servant.
Elsewhere in 1961, a Yale psychologist named Stanley Milgram began a lengthy series of behavioral experiments designed to explore the limits of obedience within a situation defined by both power and authority. As he writes in his 1974 summary opus Obedience To Authority:.
OBEDIENCE BOX?
Unable to perceive an exit from the tightly controlled situation, though often clearly suffering severe distress, the majority of Teachers in the study eventually delivered shocks to the Learners, all the way to the maximum danger level.
While openly acknowledging the massive historical difference between the German death network and his Yale psychology lab, Milgram references Arendt’s phrase “the banality of evil” as a concise way of capturing the human proclivity to perform the most morally abhorrent deeds when such deeds are perceived to be obligations within tightly defined and contractual roles, monitored and reinforced by a clearly recognized authority.
DEEP STRUCTURAL BOX

In May 2011, Eichmann’s bullet proof box was transported to Berlin for the first time, to feature in an exhibition within the Topography of Terror on the exact site of the former Reich Main Security Office, where memory traces of Eichmann’s DNA might still be detected. The exhibition questions Arendt’s analysis of Eichmann as the embodiment of her phrase “banality of evil”, contending that as a high ranking official in the SS and underling to genocidal fanatics such as Heydrich and Himmler, he was a true believer motivated not just by duty but by conviction. Letter perfect in his role as recording secretary in the formulation of the Final Solution, he then pursued its practical application with ideological fervor. Neither obedient civil servant nor the human embodiment of demonic evil, Eichmann was rather a remorseless Nazi fully conscious of his role within the meticulously networked death machine. An annotated map charts Eichmann’s business trips to sites like Auschwitz, Sobibor and Treblinka, to assess efficiency at the sites where packages became corpses.
The exhibition points out that Arendt did not attend the entire trial, and thus did not witness the unraveling of Eichmann’s “just following orders” defense upon being confronted with evidence of his interview by fellow ex-Nazi Willem Stassen, during which Eichmann told Stassen that he regretted not having exterminated even more fervently: I could have done more and should have done more. Meanwhile, Eichmann’s bullet proof box has returned to Israel, and Stanley Milgram’s obedience box remains on display inside the University of Akron’s Center for the History of Psychology:

Cards to address Garcia's status before Game 5
Left-hander will likely seek third opinion on injured pitching shoulder
WASHINGTON -- Accompanied by team physician George Paletta, Jaime Garcia traveled to New York on Thursday to have orthopedic surgeon David Altcheck provide a second opinion on his ailing left shoulder.
Garcia returned to Washington later in the day, but he offered few details about Altcheck's recommendations. Garcia noted that while Altcheck "answered more of my questions," he'll likely seek a third opinion from Dr. James Andrews before determining the next course of action.
A Cardinals spokesperson said that general manager John Mozeliak will address Garcia's status before Game 5 of the National League Division Series on Friday (7:30 p.m. CT, TBS) after "going through a final few things."
Following an abbreviated start on Monday, Garcia underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam of his left shoulder, which has given him problems multiple times this year. Paletta diagnosed Garcia with a rotator cuff strain and shoulder inflammation.
Garcia has been taken off the Cards' NLDS roster and is not expected back this postseason, should St. Louis advance to the World Series. The question now is whether the left-hander will try to address the issue simply with rest and rehab, or if he will undergo a corrective surgical procedure which could jeopardize part or all of the 2013 season.
Garcia sat out for 2 1/2 months this summer in the hopes of correcting the left shoulder strain merely through focused rehab. He returned to pitch nine regular-season games without issue, but felt discomfort throughout his only postseason start. Garcia lasted just two innings in the Game.

Irish Aid’s assistance to the people of Palestine is poverty focused with an emphasis on humanitarian and development assistance. It aims to help the Palestinian people build their institutions and infrastructure in a difficult economic and political environment and strives to ensure that assistance to Palestine helps those who are most in need. As part of its commitment to assist the people of Palestine, Ireland opened a Representative Office in Ramallah in 2000.
In 2007, over €7.5 million was provided by Irish Aid to meet the humanitarian and development needs of the Palestinian people. This represented a 70% increase on the amount provided in 2005 and included support for the delivery of basic services, humanitarian assistance in the form of core funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), as well as support for human rights and democratisation initiatives, rural development and micro-projects focused on social regeneration.
At a pledging conference for the Palestinian State on 17 December 2007, Minister of State for Overseas Development, Michael Kitt T.D., pledged additional assistance of €40 million to the Palestinian people to assist in recovery, reconstruction and development efforts, in the context of political agreement. This sum will include significant support for the Palestinian Authority as it builds the institutions of democratic statehood, encourages sustainable economic development and provides vital social services to the Palestinian people, prioritising the poorest sections of society.
The Irish Government is committed to addressing the grave humanitarian situation facing the particularly vulnerable Palestinian refugee population. Irish Aid funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) was increased in 2007 to €3.8 million and a commitment was made to maintain the same level of funding in 2008 and 2009. UNRWA is responsible for the delivery of basic services, including education, health and social services, to over 4.4 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.

Where are the celebrities
That witch should be deported for not knowing the national athem
Where is a picture of President George W Bush. I guess he is not a “celebrity.”
i cant beleieve christina goofed on the one song that dignifys our country.
“the joke of 2011″!!!!!
My son is a cancer survivor (18yrs) who lost his femur to the disease. He follows the Steelers around the country. At Jerry Jones monument to Jerry Jones my son and the other disabled fans were forced to wait for hours while the disabled peoples entrance was converted to a VIP red carpet entrance. Real fans in wheelchairs and on crutches had to wait till all the phony celebreties got their egos stroked. They, the disabled, weren’t allowed in for hours for fear of disrupting the celeb phoniness. Oh and by the way they charged 80$ for a handicapped spot.
Harry Reid George W is a celebrity just as Bernie Madeoff is I think the word for that is Notorious.
Michael Douglas looks like he has one foot in the grave.
I might not be a Cowboys fan , But people are going to say any and every thing about the Super Bowl. I’m sure other stadiums have had some issues as well.
Somebody always gets disapointed about something. Hell I wanted to go to the game but knew I could not afford it therefore I had a front row seat. If you are going to –itch you should have stayed at home. Also don’t be hating on Jerry Jones World ( aka Cowboys Stadium ) Game Over. Now watch the Packers next year at the up and coming SuperBowl GOOOO Packers.

Favorite DHC products
CoQ10 Eye Cream is a rich, sumptuous eye cream, almost seductive in how thick and silky it feels. It is not greasy and is absorbed quickly. Love this stuff!
I call Revitalizing Moisture Strips: Eyes my secret weapon. They smooth and plump the skin around my eyes, easing my laugh lines. I saw a difference the first time I used them. They really do make my eyes look younger.
I love the way Extra Nighttime Moisture makes my skin feel. In the morning, my skin has had time to rest and rejuvenate, absorbing all the goodness from that little jar, so my skin can start the day at the top of its game.
This former beauty queen—Miss Maryland United Teenager, 1981—runs her family’s towing company and is proud of their “service with a smile.” For date nights with her husband, Joe—her high school sweetheart!— she’s well versed at making a day-to-night style transition. She shares her tips on looking youthful and the surprise discovery that upended her life at 45.
Being a beauty queen is hard work
The year I held that title was a lot of work! My responsibilities included traveling to other state pageants, participating in parades, attending lots of local functions and volunteering. I also had to compete in the national phase of the competition. I didn’t win, but I competed well and had lots of fun. I realized after that pageant that I’d probably never do another one.
Life’s rich pageant
I was never sure if the other girls in the pageant wanted to do it or if their mothers wanted them to. I would tell anyone who asked if their daughter should compete in pageants that they should do it only if she wanted to.
A beauty queen’s best skincare advice
Use sunblock, don’t bake in the sun, use sunblock, wash your face with good products morning and night, use sunblock, eat a healthy diet, and use sunblock. Laughing helps, too. My boys—my husband, Joe, and son, Ryan —make me laugh every single day.
You’d never guess that …
When I was 45 years old, my father told me that I had an older brother who was put up for adoption at birth. I was stunned, but my heart quickly knew that there was a brother somewhere and he was mine.
Long-lost brother
Amazingly, I was able to find my brother, Chris, and contact him within 13 months of beginning my search; we were able to hug shortly thereafter. I’ve actually written a children’s book about the “once upon a time” of Chris’ adoption, how we found him and how he came to discover his roots.
Get to know Sherry
What are your favorite foods?
The local summer produce in my area. I live for corn, cucumbers, squash, watermelon and tomatoes. Veggies and fruit, chopped up and eaten, or simply dressed with olive oil, fresh herbs and sea salt—nothing better!
Favorite movie and why?
Anything starring Denzel Washington. Hands down, he’s my all-time favorite actor. He can make you love him or hate him in a most convincing way. But what I really love about him is his genuine nature when he’s not in a movie. If I could meet one movie star, he would be the one.
How do DHC products make you feel?
Like I’m making my best first impression! After all, your face and your skin is the first thing people see.

FYI the script tag is attempting to insert itself into the title of posts when I hit reply to a post in a lot of threads. Although not in this one ironically enough. And to head off the immediate "it all you" posts it's not happening client side.
Right, we have sorted this latest attack out so all pages are clean. They are determined to say the least. However we are making further changes now to put a stop to this which is really inconvenient for everyone. We are doing our very best to deal with these attacks and we are watching it it 24/7.

Normally when I take the bus to and from work every day, I bring along my iPod so I can listen to music or BBC Global News podcasts, to distract myself from the 1 hour+ journey. Or, if the mood strikes, I’ll listen to the bus radio, which normally blasts Arabic music the whole way up.
I had a driver the other day who was bouncing and dancing in his chair, singing along to Fairuz, an iconic Lebanese singer who had her hey-day in the 1960s & 1970s. I love it! And better yet, yesterday, my driver was blasting a mix of NSync and Backstreet Boys – I felt like I was on a high school field trip – brilliant.
Today, alas and alack, I forgot my beloved iPod. Ah well, I obviously get a kick out of Fairouz and NSync sing-a-longs, so I wasn’t too disappointed. When I switched buses in Dora, I was happy to hear that the radio was switched, at least briefly, to news and traffic updates – I was running a bit late and I wanted to know how bad the traffic was going to be – not like knowing would make me arrive any faster, but still. You know how it is. And so…
Announcer: And now, Layla with the traffic.
Layla: There is too much traffic today. God help us and God bless you all.
Announcer: Thank-you Layla. And now for some Fairouz!
….
Shou??? What???
I actually started laughing out loud on the bus, which drew strange stares from my fellow passengers, who all seemed to find this report completely normal. That’s it?!? That’s the entire traffic report?? No mention of which highways have traffic or where it stops or starts, which direction the traffic is going in?? Nope.
I told a Lebanese friend about it later, expecting her to laugh at how ridiculous it was, and instead she just looked at me, completely straight faced and serious, and said, “Hiyati, it’s so true. There is too much traffic in Lebanon. God help us!”
I give in – who needs traffic reports anyway?

enteritis en·ter·i·tis (ěn'tə-rī'tĭs)
n.
Inflammation of the intestinal tract, especially of the small intestine.
enteritis
inflammation of the intestines (especially of the small intestine), caused by irritants, poisons, viral or bacterial infections, or unknown factors. The symptoms are extremely variable but usually include continuous or intermittent diarrhea, occasionally bloody, accompanied by painful abdominal cramps. Fever is common and sometimes overshadows the digestive symptoms; serious complications may occur, especially in infants and the elderly. Enterocolitis involves the colon as well as the small intestine, and gastroenteritis includes stomach inflammation. Regional enteritis (ileitis, or Crohn disease) is a chronic inflammation that, in its classic form, is confined to the terminal portion of the ileum, the portion of the small intestine farthest from the stomach. In all forms of enteritis, treatment is usually directed toward relief of symptoms, with anti-inflammatory agents playing an important role.

Dear Brother Emmett
I received your very kind letter a few days ago I was very much delighted to hear from you again for it had been two week�s since we had a letter from you. Mother received a letter from Mrs Mathewes the same time, she was quite well she is very anxious to come to Woodville to teach if she can get a situation the reason that she is so anxious to come is so that she may be able to attend church I hope she may come I would like very much to see her. All of us here were invited to a wedding last night at Mr Harris's one of his daughters was married they thought at one time that the young man would not get there in time it was ten oclock before he arrived, all the guests were gathered and they seemed be very impatient the reason that he was so late comming was that the roads were in a dreadful condition we had a very pleasant time The war does not seeme to prevent people from getting married I believe that there has been more marriges since the war then there were before. Well Brother Emmett what do you think about the prospect of our having peace in the Spring? I hope that we may but then

Abstract
Operating frequencies in the gigahertz range is creating an increased need for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing. In the United States, FCC regulations require conformance to radiated and conducted emissions specifications. An EMC laboratory was established at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (screen room, test instrumentation, and software) and an experiment was developed to explore conducted emissions effects. This paper will describe the test configuration, explain the calibration procedure needed to acquire accurate measurements, and illustrate measurement techniques applied to two example systems. In addition, the data collection process is illustrated through software donated by CKC Laboratories (EMC specialists). To verify the functionality of the laboratory and to assess measurement accuracy, two 12V/15W switching power supplies are characterized for conducted emissions performance; one as supplied by the vendor (KGCOMP) and a second unit with the EMC filters removed. The noise spectrum for both units are plotted against frequency and compared to FCC specifications. The unaltered unit is shown to be in compliance, thus verifying the accuracy of the test procedure and instrumentation.

Prevalence of HIV risk-related behaviors among undocumented Central American immigrant women in Houston, Texas, 2010
Abstract
The primary aim of this dissertation research is to provide epidemiological data on HIV risk-related behaviors among undocumented Central American immigrant women living in Houston, Texas. Between February and May 2010, we used respondent driven sampling (RDS) to recruit 230 Guatemalan, Honduran, and El Salvadoran women, ages 18 to 50 years, living in Houston without a valid United States visa or residency papers. RDS is a probability-based sampling method that utilizes social networks to access members of hidden populations that lack a sampling frame. Participants completed an interview regarding their demographics, access to and utilization of healthcare services, HIV testing, and sexual behaviors. Data from this study were used 1) to describe the prevalence of sexual HIV risk-related behaviors among undocumented Central American immigrant women, comparing those who recently immigrated to the U.S. (within the past five years) to those with more established residency (of over five years); 2) to describe the prevalence of lifetime HIV testing and evaluate its associated factors in this target population; and 3) to describe the effectiveness of RDS to access members of this target population. ^ As described in Paper 1, there was a generally low prevalence of individual HIV risk-related behaviors (i.e., multiple, concurrent, convenience, and casual sexual partnerships) among the undocumented Central American immigrant women in this study. However, there was evidence of HIV risk due to unprotected sex with male partners who have concurrent sexual partnerships. We identified recent immigrants as the subpopulation at greatest risk, as they were significantly more likely than established immigrants to have multiple and/or concurrent sexual partners. As described in Paper 2, the lifetime prevalence of HIV testing was almost 70%. After adjusting for age, number of years living in the U.S., income security, and resource barriers, lifetime HIV testing was significantly associated with being from Honduras, having more than a sixth grade education, having a regular healthcare provider, and having knowledge of available healthcare resources. Finally, as described in Paper 3, RDS was an effective method for obtaining a diverse sample of Central American immigrant women in Houston. ^ This project is the first to use RDS to conduct an HIV behavioral survey among undocumented Central American immigrant women. Our results will inform the design of future research studies and the implementation of HIV prevention activities among undocumented Central American immigrants in the U.S.^

MARK MADISON: Hi, I'm Mark Madison, and it's June 30th, 2010, and we're doing a live Podcast from the Student Conservation and Climate Congress. It's our second annual gathering at the National Conservation Training Center in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, and today we have one of our speakers who spoke this morning, Peter Essick, who is a photographer, a photojournalist for the last 23 years. He does a lot of stories for National Geographic and other outlets and he's particularly taken some stunning images on global climate change around the world.
So, Peter, thank you so much for joining us here.
PETER ESSICK: Thank you. Nice to be here.
MARK MADISON: And we also have Emily Jenkins, who works at NCTC, who will be joining me in asking Peter a few questions.
And, Peter, we wanted to just ask you first: What made you want to become a photographer?
PETER ESSICK: Well, I took a photo class in high school, and I guess-- it sort of found my passion right away, and I knew that was what I wanted to do. It took me several years after that to figure out to make a living doing it. I ended up going through college and getting a degree in business, but eventually went back to the University of Missouri in photojournalism and was fortunate enough to get a summer internship at National Geographic magazine, and that's sort of how I got my foot in the door at National Geographic. But I found my passion for photography in a high school photo class.
MARK MADISON: That's great. And you're speaking to high school students this week. So hopefully you inspired a few future photojournalists.
PETER ESSICK: Great. I hope so, too.
MARK MADISON: And one of the things you're famous for is your photos of global climate change. How do you visually tell that story as a photographer?
PETER ESSICK: Well, I first started to do research by looking at science and nature articles that were peer-reviewed science papers, and I tried to think of ones that seemed to me to tell a compelling story or had a lot of solid proof that something was changing, and then I had to contact the scientists themselves and see if they were doing some active field work and see if I could work their schedule into my schedule and to go out and-- but that was one of the core principles of that story, was to make sure that all the pictures were accurate and that they had some scientific backing. And then also we had to make sure that there was some visual side to it that could make a compelling picture for National Geographic.
MARK MADISON: Great.
EMILY JENKINS: What was the most interesting adventure that you went on to take pictures?
PETER ESSICK: Well, we like to think the most interesting is the next story. I've been to about 100 countries now and all 50 states, and so it's sometimes hard to-- hard to remember them all sometimes and to sometimes choose, but I loved the story down in Patagonia. I think for a landscape photographer, that's almost like heaven. You have dramatic lighting, dramatic mountains, weather, glaciers, forests.
I did a story in Finland in the winter, and that was a very great experience for me visually just to see sort of the frozen north land.
So it's hard for me to pick one place. Often people think that the fjord lands, Norway, Patagonia, southeast coast of Alaska are the most beautiful areas of the world. So I tend to agree with that from a landscape perspective.
EMILY JENKINS: That's awesome. You have such beautiful pictures, especially of the Glacier National Park. Those are awesome.
PETER ESSICK: Thank you.
EMILY JENKINS: How do you hope to inspire the Student Climate and Conservation Congress kids?
PETER ESSICK: Well, I guess if there was one message, it would be just to follow their passion, whatever they're passionate about. I've found that the artists that I admire most are those that if you're passionate about grizzly bears and really want to tell the world what a great animal that is, you'll probably-- either with your writing or your photography, you'll do well. And if it's photography, photography is a difficult field now, print journalism is difficult, but I still try not to discourage people from getting into it. There are ways to get around that and find new outlets for it. But I think you have to first find the area that you really are passionate about.
MARK MADISON: You seem particularly passionate about climate change and conservation. Were there other influences that made you interested in the environment?
PETER ESSICK: Well, it started with my father. He was a science teacher, and he was also an outdoorsman. He liked to go backpacking and hiking and skiing. So he was my first influence, definitely, with the love of the outdoors.
I think since I've become a father myself I've gotten really interested in some of the environmental issues. The great environmentalist David Brower had a quote that said that, "Environmentalists sometimes don't make the best neighbors, but they make great ancestors." So I like to think that my photos will, you know, help make the world better for him now as far as-- when you start thinking about climate, I think a lot of the
problems, the potential problems, are going to come up in his lifetime and maybe even in his children's lifetime. So, trying to look ahead to that as far as-- and that's, I guess, having-- becoming a father has made me more aware of that.
MARK MADISON: That's great.
Your photos have appeared on the National Geographic cover story on global warming and "An Inconvenient Truth," and an audio Podcast really doesn't do them justice. Is there a web site or something where people could go if they wanted to learn more about you or your photos?
PETER ESSICK: There is the National Geographic, on their web site they have a contributors-- I do have some of my photos, it's called rayoflightphotographs.com. My wife and I have a web site where we sell posters and note cards of some of my landscape photos. So you can look at the landscape photos there.
MARK MADISON: Well, Peter, thank you so much for coming to the second annual Sc3 Conference. The students obviously loved it, and they swarmed you afterwards with a lot of questions. I think it was very inspirational, and I appreciate your time to do this quick audio Podcast, and I want to thank all of you who took the time to listen to this Podcast.
PETER ESSICK: Great. Thank you very much. Nice to be here.

Everything changes: Simon Cowell admits Gary Barlow may not return as an X Factor judge
Despite managing to guide one of his acts into the grand final and finishing as a runner-up on last year's X Factor, Gary Barlow may not return to the ITV1 show.
Music mogul and X Factor supremo Simon Cowell admitted that although Gary was a firm favourite with fans he might not be able to return this year because of his busy schedule.
Cowell said that the 41-year-old will have a lot on his plate this year with his day job being a member of Take That.
Busy boy: Gary Barlow may not return to The X Factor this year because of Take That commitments
He told the Sun: 'This show takes over your life, it is not a two day a week show.'
Take That are planning to release a new album and in order to promote it Gary would need to be with the band a lot of the time travelling up and down the country and through Europe.
Simon said to the newspaper: 'I always thought that with Gary he would have the Take That commitment in 2012.
Rain man: Simon Cowell says the X Factor is time consuming
'But there has to be a certain amount of unpredictability with this show, it is what keeps people interested.'
According to reports, all of the new judges found the show very time consuming last year and were surprised by how much it took over their lives.
The 2011 series of X Factor UK – with new judges Gary Barlow, Tulisa Contostavlos and Kelly Rowland joining Louis Walsh – found itself being regularly beaten in the ratings war by BBC rival Strictly Come Dancing.
Despite in-fighting between the judges and controversy surrounding contestant Frankie Cocozza, the series averaged 14.13million viewers, with 15.5million tuning in to watch Little Mix crowned the winners.
However, the previous year, a record 19.4million watched Matt Cardle beat Rebecca Ferguson to the crown.
He told The Sun: 'I got a bit too cocky. We got a big wake-up call.
'We went into 2011 thinking, ''It's all going to be easy'' and of course it wasn't. It was the year my ego was put in check.'
Fighting talk: Gary Barlow and Louis Walsh became sparring partners on the show

Just in case this has bitten others: Cedet (at least the current 1.1 version) does not play well with Slime. It clobbers some Slime facilities, like arg-list documentation in the mode line, and it seems to map capital letter key bindings to lower case key bindings (like
C-c C-d A seems to run
C-c C-d a which is
slime-apropos). There are probably other annoying "step on other libraries' toes" sorts of bugs as well. My advice is that if you are seeing odd Slime behavior, or odd anything behavior, pull the Cedet stuff out of your
.emacs file and try without it.
This almost certainly has to do with the way many Cedet setup guides direct you to enable a bunch of
global-xxx-mode settings. However, I don't have any lines like this in my
.emacs file and still see odd behavior, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is the default.
I found this that briefly sketches how you might only locally enable Cedet. This seems a bit involved and there is no guarantee of it resolving the problem. So, I guess I am back to using by memory to figure out structure members like some kind of animal.

Blocking the IP address would still allow the person to read. Blocking the IP address will also prevent anyone else from that ISP from posting.

I can’t wait to go see this!
I’m curious… does Disney still has to pay any kind of royalties to the family by bringing this amazing attraction back?

Whether the super committee reaches agreement or not, however, the deficit hawks win. If they agree, either $1.2 trillion gets cut from the budget or taxes go up by that amount; and the committee co-chair has categorically stated taxes are not going up, so that means the budget will be cut. If agreement is not reached, $1.2 trillion in cuts automatically kick in, split evenly between domestic and military spending. Either way, the economy will wind up with $1.2 trillion less in the way of purchasing power. The result will be to reduce demand, kill jobs, and put more people on the streets.
For the deficit hawks, however, it all seems to be going according to plan. The super committee is characterized as an emergency measure that was rushed through to avoid an arbitrarily imposed August deadline for freezing the debt ceiling, but it has actually been in the works for years. In 2009, it was called the “Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action”. That plan died when its Senate sponsors, Judd Gregg and Kent Conrad, failed to secure 60 votes for passage in the Senate. The Gregg-Conrad bill was criticized as railroading through legislation that would unconstitutionally slash domestic services without congressional debate, but its task force would actually have been LESS autocratic than the super committee, which has sweeping powers and needs only a simple majority among its 12 members to prevail.
What has been forced out of the debate is whether cutting the budget is a good idea at all. The Peter Peterson Foundation, which has been pushing “austerity” for years, has finally gotten its way. Hedge fund magnate Peter G. Peterson was Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations until 2007 and head of the New York Federal Reserve between 2000 and 2004. He made his fortune with the controversial Blackstone Group, which he co-founded and chaired for many years. The Peter Peterson Foundation was established in 2008 with a $1 billion endowment to raise public awareness about U.S. fiscal-sustainability issues related to federal deficits, entitlement programs, and tax policies. The money was used to spearhead a massive campaign to reduce the runaway federal debt. Hysteria over the debt then prompted Tea Party newbies in Congress to hold a gun to Congress’ head by arbitrarily capping the debt.
In the campaign to educate us to the debt’s perils, we were repeatedly warned that when foreign lenders decided to pull the plug, the U.S. would have to declare bankruptcy; that we were mortgaging our grandchildren’s futures and selling them into debt-slavery; and that all this was the fault of the citizenry for borrowing and spending too much. The American people, who are already suffering massive unemployment and cutbacks in government services, would have to sacrifice more and pay the piper more, just as in those debt-strapped countries forced into austerity measures by the IMF.
The fear-mongering, however, is a red herring. A sovereign nation can always find the money to pay debts owed in its own currency. The Federal Reserve can buy the debt itself – just as it has been doing. That alternative would effectively eliminate the problem of interest, since the Fed returns its profits to the government after deducting its costs.
Alternatively,.
Neither option need inflate prices. As long as the money is used to purchase goods and services, the result will simply be to increase demand, increasing production. Prices will not increase until the economy reaches full employment, and at that point any excess in the money supply can be taxed back to the government, keeping prices stable.
The key to all this is that our debt is owed in our own currency – U.S. dollars. Our government has the power to fix its solvency problems itself, by simply issuing the money it needs to pay off or refinance its debt. The U.S. federal debt has been carried on the books since 1835. It has NEVER been paid off during that time but just continues to grow. This has not hurt the economy, which for most of that period has been among the most vibrant in the world. The federal debt IS the money supply. All of our money except coins is created as bank debt. Historically, when the deficit has been reduced, the money supply has been reduced along with it, throwing the economy into recession.
The real problem with a growing federal debt is the interest on it, which WILL become an insurmountable burden if allowed to grow exponentially. Interest paid on the federal debt in 2010 was $414 billion, or about one-half of personal income tax receipts. That’s about as high as we dare let it go. But this problem can be eliminated either by funding the debt through the nation’s own central bank, effectively interest-free, or by the Treasury issuing the money outright, interest-free..

3D sonar was working really well when I gave up on it & no-one has made any traction with it, since then.
Electronic warfare has been around since Vietnam and there are weapons capable of taking out any Jamming or " control signal If the military felt threatened they would alter or shut GPS off .In this post they are Talking about the old radio direction finder here they were becoming automatic and were getting computing skills worked best up to 150 miles when Loran came along and put you within 16 ft 1,000 miles away Have a good day!
This sounds like what an iPhone does to get a location fix while it is waiting to get a GPS lock...triangulating off of cell towers and known wifi base stations. The difference is that Apple has a database of all of these signal sources that was expensive to build and now must be maintained. This approach sounds like it builds the database locally, onboard, as the vehicle moves around. I'm kind of surprised we haven't seen a university or open source effort along these lines, since all the radios are getting so cheap and small...maybe it's out there and I just haven't noticed?
I can't believe it's that more difficult to jam huge swathes of frequency. Hell, a spark generator will do that. All the main useable frequencies are quite predictable, the only feasible solution seems to be inertial navigation.
Moderator Comment by Gary Mortimer on July 2, 2012 at 6:53am
Don't forget vision based systems are out there as well.
I think switching to a vision based is much more feasible than simply swapping one frequency for navigation from another Gary..
Moderator Comment by Gary Mortimer on July 2, 2012 at 8:42am
Good show Gary! There are astro nav plugins as well.......
So BAE's system can use pretty much any frequency, to me they just built a SDR that does GPS (i.e. time syncing). It's been done before. And considering the "big box", sounds about right. But I hope they solved the reflection issues that are more prevailing in terrestrial-based com systems to get clock accuracy close to what GPS provides.
Like Skyhook, this could augment, replace or support GPS. Is the hard part in integrating the hardware that is able to pick up all kinds of usable RF? A very wideband antenna setup and the dedicated hardware to crunch the numbers to make sense of it all, and referencing it with its database, sure makes for an interesting system.

>> papacy is a very demanding role and position in our church. It takes great wisdom to reach a decision such as this and we admire him for acting prudently on behalf of our church and his own sake,” Bishop Joseph N. Latino of the Diocese of Jackson, which includes Northeast Mississippi, said in a statement.
Latino said that during nearly eight years as pope, the 85-year-old Benedict “has worked for greater understanding among faith traditions, and spoke out on behalf of truth and justice tempered with mercy. He continued to engage us in a dialogue on these truths and the dangers of moral relativism.
“We offer him our fervent prayers for fruitful retirement years and we thank him for his life of service to our church and indeed the world.”
Latino and Bishop Roger Morin of the Diocese of Biloxi offered prayers to the College of Cardinals who will convene in March to elect a successor to Pope Benedict.
University of Mississippi Law Professor Ronald Rychlak said Benedict’s decision came not from weakness, but from a desire for the good of the church.
“When Benedict’s doctor advised against going on any more trips, he saw the church needed someone more vibrant who can handle the mental and physical challenges of the papacy,” he said.
Rychlak has served as an adviser to the Holy See’s delegation to the United Nations for 12 years. The Holy See is the diplomatic arm of the Vatican, complete with embassies and presence at international summits.
“Benedict’s predecessor, Pope John Paul II, was under 60 when elected pope in 1978, so his papacy was very long by comparison, lasting until 2005,” Rychlak said. “When a pope as old as Benedict is elected, it comes with the expectation of a relatively short papacy, which allows for a smooth transition.”
Benedict said in his announcement he planned to vacate the papacy on Feb. 28, but a timeline for selecting a predecessor remains unclear. Though it is not unusual for a pope to groom an individual or group of possible candidates to take his place, Rychlak said it is dangerous to make predictions along political lines.
“A pope is not going to be elected based on which country they are from, what color their skin is, or how old they are,” he said. “The cardinals will base their decision through careful prayer to select which man best emulates Christ with wisdom, knowledge and devotion.”
However, Rychlak noted Benedict’s successor will most likely be the first pope whose ministry does not predate the Vatican II international conference of the 1960s, which sought to put the church in context with the modern world.
FRAIL-LOOKING
Christi Houin, a member of St. James Catholic Church in Tupelo, got to see Benedict in person last October, after winning a trip to Rome through a contest on a Catholic radio station. When the trip toured the Vatican, Houin said the pope passed within arm’s reach of her.
“It may sound bad, but one of my first thoughts was how frail he seemed. If you didn’t see him in person, you might not expect that,” she said.
Despite the turbulent times for the church during his papacy, Houin said Benedict himself should be remembered for his intelligence and his writing.
“He made an impression on me as a very intelligent man and also a very gentle man,” Houin said. “It was amazing to hear him speak to the audience in so many different languages, and the writing he has done has been amazing.”
Benedict’s works point to moral relativism as the cause of much of the world’s strife, according to Mary Woodward, director of communications for the Jackson Diocese. She said Benedict’s heart for the world’s needy would be missed.
“He has so much respect for the dignity of humanity, and has shown such a commitment to dialogue among different faith traditions to bring awareness to the margins of the world,” she said.
Father Lincoln Dall, priest at St. James in Tupelo, said he hoped for the next pope to pursue that same mission.
“Benedict facilitated the church becoming more global, making the church aware of different cultures living out their faith,” he said.

The Oxford Planning Commission voted Monday not to recommend the request of developer Kenny Coleman to rezone 64 acres between South Lamar Boulevard and Highway 7 South from single-family residential to multi-unit residential.
The property had originally been planned as Phase 2 of the Windsor Falls development until economic strains intervened. It was later considered but rejected for a new hospital.
"Nothing would have pleased me more than to continue that development the way it was going," Coleman said.
State law and precedent require that rezoning be based either on an error in existing zoning or a change in the neighborhood and a demonstrated public need for the requested new zoning. Coleman's market researcher said more than 20 multi-unit complexes she called all claimed little or no vacancy.
"Everywhere that I went, unanimously, everyone said that they filled up, that as soon as they opened, they were full," she said.
Attorney Carter Hitt contended that neighboring multi-family units denote a neighborhood in change, but nearby residents noted hundreds of single-family homes dominate South Oaks, Grand Oaks, Windsor Falls and Notting Hill.
A representative for Windsor Falls residents accused Coleman of several breaches as a developer, ranging from faulty slope stabilization and long-delayed paving to reneging on promises of a lake, greenspace and walking trails.
Commissioners voted 5-0 against recommending the zoning change to the Board of Aldermen, with Watt Bishop abstaining.
The Planning Commission voted 6-0 to recommend a change from multi-unit residential to general business and neighborhood business for an 8.5-acre tract just south of Highway 6 at the city's west end. Landowner Rickey Britt said a tractor dealership and a hunting store are likely occupants.

I loved their first two albums, the 3rd was a total miss imho but maybe they thought the same because since then….
Nevermind… Great share!
I came across a promo of mr. Mister which has the same exact song on both sides. Titled is it love. Both run 3:32. Numbers on the 45 are jk-14313 (pb-14313). I am unable to find this vinyl on any sight. It is in excellent condition with sleeve in very good condition. Would you be so kind as to tell me if I should use it as a frisbee, or cash it in as a retirement plan?
Um, well, neither I suppose. Sounds like you have a radio promo on your hands but, I doubt that it is highly valuable. But, all the same, it’s worth more than a frisbee dude!

One of my favourite Club tunes of 1982, and a huge UK hit like you mentioned. Their treatment sounded so unique and fresh back then, very different from Eddy Grant’s original and also anything else out during the same time.
Arthur is such a god when it comes to producing and remixing!
Thanks Richie!
I can retire my 12″ vinyl now. LOL!
One of the best club tracks ever!
Sorry if I haven’t been very responsive to comments lately. My father had to undergo an unexpected surgery last week and my life has been upside down for the last 8 or 9 days. Thankfully, he came home yesterday and is steadily improving. If it weren’t for being able to schedule posts in advance, I probably would have missed a few days of posting as well…
For us kids of the 80s, our parents are likely in their silver senior years by now. So I can empathize totally with you, Richie.
I’m glad to hear the positive news and hopes your father makes a full recovery soon!
And kudos to you for keeping your music on during trying times!
Thanx a bunch for this one.
This was huge hit all over Europe and really big one here in Iceland.
Can’t wait to hear our rip.
P.S do you have their follow up Harder They Come?
I hope your father recovers well
Thanx

Thank you. I guess today’s post answered your question?

Hope he recovers well.

Challenge 1: Did your family have any New Year’s traditions? How was the New Year celebrated during your childhood? Have you kept these traditions in the present day?
I don’t remember much about New Year’s celebrations of my childhood. Our family of six got together with the D family of five, swapping out which home hosted the gathering. We ate Brunswick Stew and played in the basement. Was that New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day? Meh.
The only celebration that really stands out was a party I hosted on New Year’s Eve, 1969. A gaggle of eighth grade girls giggled and talked from the sleeping bags scattered on the den’s concrete pad floor. The black and white television probably showed footage of the Times Square countdown, and we probably had snacks from the kitchen just steps away. I don’t remember.
I don’t remember any conversation–but this.
Hugging a pillow tight, Humpy said, “Just think, in ten years, we won’t know each other. We won’t know where each other lives. We won’t know each other’s secrets or boyfriends or jobs. It is now 1970, and in 1980 we won’t know each other!”
The future suddenly cast a shadow into our small, snug party. We could feel its tug, its scattering hand. Someone started to cry. And we hugged each other, mourning all the losses we would have to live in the new decade. Gradually sleep overtook our eyes, clouding our vision of the future. From that brief moment, I was changed; the human capacity to imagine a future–without current companions–was awakened. It was the dawning of adulthood that dawning of 1970.
Great post! Thank you for participating in the 52-week series.

What Is The Point Of This?
This is the trailer for "REPO! The Genetic Opera" starring Paris Hilton. Paris plays some singing slut in a cheap brown wig or something. This movie looks as entertaining as a root canal. I mean the sounds from the root canal are more pleasant than the sounds from this trailer.
Skip to about 39 seconds to see Paris in action and by action I mean humiliating herself once again. The least they could do is dub her ass. Any one of her dogs can howl better than her.
The movie also stars Paul Sorvino, Sarah Brightman and Alexa Vega.
Straight to the $1 movie theaters!

The Internet wine market may soon be heating up.
With Amazon.com expected to announce a foray into online wine sales (no statement yet from the company), Wine.com, a leading online wine merchant, is trying to get some of the attention back by unveiling a new effort to increase its market share in time for the holidays.
Wine.com on Monday announced a new Wine.com “Marketplace,” designed to make it easier for consumers to purchase small-production wines domestic and imported.
These are the wines that direct shipping is made for – boutique wineries that do not have widespread distribution through the increasingly hardened arteries of the three-tier system. These wineries have had to navigate a patchwork of state regulations, permits and fees that often discourage direct shipping even while supposedly facilitating it. Wine.com, founded in 1998, has built its online wine business by working that compliance angle with the states.
,” Michael Osborn, Wine.com Founder and VP of Merchandising, gushed in a press release. “Nothing will change for the thousands of wines, both imported and domestic, with current distribution and presence with Wine.com. The Marketplace assortment will instead expand to provide greater choices to our customers.”
Under Wine.com’s new program, which had a “soft launch” earlier this year, Wine.com will handle all compliance, sales tax, warehousing, fulfillment, order tracking and customer service, as well as the expense of shipping the wine. Wineries will be responsible for delivering the wines to a licensed Wine.com storage facility. That differs from the reported Amazon model, which had the online sales giant leveraging shipping costs but leaving the actual sales and shipping to the wineries. The Wine.com Marketplace will also offer imported wines, while only Napa and Sonoma wineries were to be involved in the Amazon program.
An advantage for consumers would be that an entire order, even consisting of wines from multiple wineries, would arrive at your door in a single package. That could reduce the hassle factor of coming home and finding the FedEx or UPS sticker on your door informing you that your wine will be bouncing around in an un-air conditioned truck for another day. For an upfront annual fee of $49, all of your orders will ship free.
Wine.com says it ships 2.5 million bottles a year. The Marketplace will begin by shipping to 20 states, including Virginia, and the District, but not Maryland.
The Wine.com press release did not identify wineries that will be represented in their new Marketplace, so it will be interesting to see how this program differs from the website’s regular offerings. (Do we really need Apothic Red shipped directly to our homes? I guess so: It is one of Wine.com’s top selling wines, according to the website. Perhaps people are embarrassed to be seen buying it in a store?)
And we really won’t be able to see the Marketplace. A publicist told me there will be no special tab on the website heralding these wines – they will be blended into the shopping list for consumers in the 20 states where they are available. That strikes me as a little cynical – many wine lovers would probably enjoy browsing this special list, like a distinct shelf in the local wine store.
Even if the new Marketplace is simply an effort to add more small-production wines to Wine.com’s extensive sales list, any additional chink in the armor of the three-tier system is welcome news for wine lovers.

At 678 Queen Street West sits a fantastical restaurant with a Czech in its step, Czehoski (cha hos key). A Czech butcher shop and deli for more than 75 years…now a hip restaurant and bar on Queen Street West. Today the space offers a hip and contemporary dining experience with a blend of downtown sophistication and heritage warmth. The chef flirts with standard Western Cuisine that reflect a love for classic comfort foods.
On my first visit to Czehoski I glanced through the menu, made my decisions and when the waitress arrived was delighted to hear that for one night only the chef was offering, Dolly. Dolly apparently was the pig he had been taking care of for years and had recently butchered. The age old rumor that a pet once loved tastes better than farmed cattle is indeed true! It’s important to have a relationship with the food you are eating.
I enjoyed the restaurants poutine (which assert is one of the best three in the city), mac n cheese (which is served with chorizo sausage and lima beans), and Dolly which was a cut of our pet pig with beans, cabbage and a sweet sauce that left the tongue feeling of velvet.
#6 restaurant reviewed in Ontario since moving to Toronto in 2010.

If the problem with U.S. policy toward South Asia during the Cold War was too little sustained attention by Washington, the challenge now may be too much. The super-priorities of counterterrorism and the war in Afghanistan represent important national security goals for the United States. But the sheer diversity of U.S. policy interests across South Asia makes coherent, long-range strategy more difficult.
A new Asia Society report, The United States and South Asia after Afghanistan, suggests there is an opportunity to recalibrate U.S. policy toward South Asia — drawn from more than 90 interviews with experts and former practitioners throughout the interagency.
Long-term perspective is difficult when short-term priorities crowd one’s inbox. The daily challenges of South Asia policy make long-range planning difficult. Administrations are measured on what they do, not how they think, but the risk is that strategy gets parked to one side.
The good news is the Obama administration has worked hard to develop a long-range economic strategy for South Asia — the “New Silk Road,” a vision of economic integration and improved regional relations. But connecting the countries of South Asia with each other and their neighbors may not be enough.
China is rising as an actor in South Asian. Its trade with the countries of South Asia is growing fast, and other Asian states such as Japan are taking note. The United States has responded — no longer allowing the extraordinary situation of the 1990s to persist, where contact between U.S. assistant secretaries of state working on South and East Asian policy was practically non-existent.
Now, a range of exchanges, talks, and visits reflect greater policy connectivity within the State Department and between those leading on South and Central, South East, and East Asian policy. Bob Blake, the assistant secretary for South and Central Asia, visits Beijing, for instance, while Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary for East Asia and the Pacific, goes to Delhi.
As the Obama administration continues to rebalance its policy priorities toward Asia, there is a tremendous opportunity to build upon the policy accomplishments of recent years. A range of engaged, thoughtful officials from across the interagency have an opportunity to take stock, peer forward, and generate an integrated strategic approach to South Asia as a whole.
India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and China are key state actors, but so are the other states of South Asia, which are all too often reduced to the briefest of mentions. Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan are close neighbors of China and have the potential to contribute to broader regional stability and prosperity, both through enhanced trade and their energy potential. As maritime trade grows ever more important for both China and South Asia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives gain rising relevance for policy makers.
These are all good reasons for Washington to renew its focus and attention on South Asia on the eve of the second Obama administration. To that end, the report, The United States and South Asia after Afghanistan, draws on the collective wisdom of past policy makers toward the region to make a series of specific recommendations — framed by a set of important principles to help guide the incoming diplomatic team.

A pointer to a product name. The product name is used to locate the directory for messages. Its location depends on the operating system. For example, in Solaris, the directory of message files for the
rdbms product is
$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms.
A pointer to a facility name in the product. It is used to construct a message file name. A message file name follows the conversion with
facility as prefix. For example, the message file name for the
img facility in the American language is
imgus.msb, where
us is the abbreviation for the American language and
msb is the message binary file extension.
The duration for memory allocation for the return message handle. It can have the following values:
It first tries to open the message file corresponding to
hndl. If it succeeds, then it uses that file to initialize a message handle. If it cannot find the message file that corresponds to the language, then it looks for a primary language file as a fallback. For example, if the Latin American Spanish file is not found, then it tries to open the Spanish file. If the fallback fails, then it uses the default message file, whose language is
AMERICAN. The function returns a pointer to a message handle into the
msghp parameter.
OCI_SUCCESS, OCI_INVALID_HANDLE, or OCI_ERROR.

This chapter contains these topics:
Section 96.1, "Purging Closed A/R Records,"
Section 96.2, "Purging Batch Receipts."
To reduce the size of your A/R tables and conserve system disk space, purge your A/R information periodically.
From Accounts Receivable (G03), enter 27
From A/R Advanced and Technical Operations (G0331), choose an option under the A/R Purge heading
To reduce the amount of records in your A/R ledger, purge your closed A/R records. Purging closed A/R records:
Removes the closed records from the A/R Ledger table (F0311) if:
The G/L date of the transaction is on or before the "as of" date set in the processing options.
The open amount is zero.
The transaction is posted.
The Number of Payments (Recurring Invoices) is equal to zero.
Copies purged records to the Purge - A/R Ledger table (F0311P)
For reporting purposes, you can keep the purge table on your system or copy it to another medium, such as a diskette or tape. If you keep it on your system and you purge again, the system adds newly purged records to the existing table.
Caution:When you run this program ensure that you type the correct purge date before you press Enter. If you accidentally submit a purge for processing, put the job on hold and contact your system administrator.
Coordinate when you run the purge programs for all the systems that you use.
Back up the A/R Ledger table.
Be careful not to purge A/R ledger information that may be needed by other systems, such as Sales Order Processing or Contract/Service Billing.
After records are copied to the A/R Purge file, they are deleted from the A/R Detail file. Space will not be regained on your system until the A/R Detail file (F0311) is "reorganized" and the A/R Purge files have been moved to tape or diskette. The reorganization procedure removes the space created by deleted records in the file and orders the existing records based on your request. Reorganize Files (P98999) is a technical program that should only be executed by the system administrator.
Since records for multiple years could be written to the F0311P file, you could rename this file to differentiate it from A/R transactions purged with different G/L dates. If the file remains in your library and the purge is run again, records will be added to the end of the file. Once the purge is complete, it is recommended to copy the purged file to a different library, or to a tape or diskette. If you are copying them to another media, remember to clear the data in the purge files left on your system.
See Section 114.7, "Purge Closed A/R Records (P03800)."
To prevent the system from purging recurring invoices, set the Number of Payments field to equal (EQ) Zero.
To avoid unpredictable results while purging, do not change the following data sequence:
Document Company
Document Number
Document Type
To remove posted receipt records from your A/R system, purge batch receipts.
Purging batch receipts removes posted receipts from the Batch A/R Receipt Application table (F0312). You can copy the purged records to a purge table and then move the purge table to a diskette or tape and delete it from your hard drive. This lets you regain disk space and still access the purged records, if necessary.
This purge uses a specific version of the P00PURGE program (ZJDE0009) that is set up to purge the F0312.

Your installation contains executable script files that simplify invoking the Derby tools. On UNIX systems, these files might need to have their default protections set to include execute privilege.

.
Diagnosis
The doctor will ask about your child’s symptoms and medical history and do a physical exam. Tests may include the following:
- Stress test —tests how the body responds to exercise, which can help in detecting heart and lung problems
- Echocardiography —uses sound waves (ultrasound) to examine the size, shape, and motion of the heart
- Transesophageal echocardiogram —images of the heart are taken using sound waves with a sound wave transducer being put down the throat
- the body as a dye is injected through the catheter. This allows angiograms (photos) to be taken of the blood vessels and the heart.)
- Chest x-ray —uses radiation to take a picture of structures inside the body
- Blood tests
Treatment
Treatment focuses on controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Talk with the doctor about the best treatment plan for your child. Treatment options include:
Medications
Medicines may be used to help maintain proper and regular heart function. They may also be used to remove excess fluid from the body. If your child has an arrhythmia, he may need anti-arrhythmic drugs. He may also need blood-thinning medicine.: 06/2012 -

Definition.
Causes:
- High blood pressure
- Blood in the urine
- Urinary tract infection
- Kidney stones
- Additional, less common symptoms may include:
- Nail abnormalities
- Painful menstrual periods
- Joint pain
- Drowsiness
If you experience any of these symptoms, do not assume it is due to PKD. These symptoms may be caused by other, less serious health conditions. If you experience any of them, see your physician.
Diagnosis.
Recent research has led to the creation of several drugs that may prevent cysts from developing. An example is somatostatin, which has been studied in humans and may one day be available to prevent polycystic kidneys from developing.
Prevention
PKD is an inherited disease and is not preventable. If you have a family history of PKD, you may want to talk to your doctor about genetic testing.

Consumers in Asia / Pacific, Middle East and Africa still treat dining and entertainment as their top spending priorities for the next six months, according to MasterCard's Survey on Consumer Purchasing Priorities.
The two categories had also figured on top in the previous survey in December 2008. The category topped the list for discretionary spend in 18 of the 21 markets across Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa.
Among the 10 main categories included in the MasterCard survey, spend on extracurricular activities for one's children, and on fitness and wellness are expected to be the least prone to cutbacks, revealed the 'MasterCard Worldwide Index of Consumer Purchasing Resilience', which is based on the survey findings. The index measures consumers' resistance for cutting expenditure.
According to the survey, the top priorities for expenditure for the next six months are:
Dining and entertainment: 69 per cent Fashion and accessories: 49 per cent Fitness and wellness: 36 per centConsumer electronics and children's extra-curricular activities/private tuition: 34 per cent
Dining and entertainment is also among the top three categories most resilient to cutbacks in consumer spending. It registered a score of 69 in the resilience index, behind children's extra-curricular activities / private tuition (87) and fitness and wellness (78). Consumer electronics (67) and fashion and accessories (65) also showed resilience to cutbacks.

Tata Communications Ltd and Middle Eastern telecom operators will work with Tyco Telecommunications to build the Tata Global Network (TGN) Gulf cable project, Tata Telecom said in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
Tyco Telecommunications will construct the TGN Gulf cable system for Tata Communications and its partners in the TGN Gulf project, namely Bahrain Internet Exchange, Nawras of Oman, Qatar Telecom, Mobility and Etisalat, who will each be an exclusive landing party for the TGN Gulf Cable System.
Tata Communications and its partners will build on this cable project as part of strategic relationships that will support the development of an extended portfolio of advanced telecommunications services such as global Ethernet, MPLS-based VPN, managed security, IaaS (infrastructure as a service) and global telepresence, a company release said.
"All these services are ideally suited to support both local and global enterprises, which are very active in this rapidly expanding emerging market region," the company said in its filing with the BSE.
TGN, previously VSNL Transpacific, is a submarine telecommunications cable system transiting the Pacific Ocean.
The cable system is constructed with one cable from Emi, Japan, to Hillsboro, Oregon, USA; one from Toyohashi, Japan, to Hillsboro; one from Toyohashi, Japan, to LA; and one from Toyohashi to Guam. The cables are constructed with 8 fibre pairs per cable, which at construction could support up to 96 10 Gbit/s waves.

Cold, hard, and emotionless statistics predict that it takes on average 21.4 weeks to land a job, and for those over 55 the hunt can last as long as 39.9 weeks. If you’re in the 100k plus snack-bracket expect for an average hunt of 30 weeks. Experts outline the top ten tips on how to be successful in your cover letter, 64 of the toughest interview questions, and the endless lists of do’s and don’ts. I feel like I’ve read them all. It is easy to talk in terms of figures and best practices; it is quite a different experience to live through it.
I’ve said it a hundred times in the past several months; sometimes you need to go through the miry clay of unemployment to learn about yourself; the good, bad and indifferent. I’ve discovered a few rare colleagues who were life-long friends in disguise; people who’ve had my back and sometimes picked me up by my collar to put me back on my feet again. I’ve been disappointed by some of my failings; and surprised at how my very strange idiosyncrasies protected me from getting a position with a company I later learned would have been a disastrous work environment.
I’ve worked hard, tirelessly in fact, putting myself out there. In the job hunt you’re aiming for one, just one, to close. It’s a win ratio that would crush any coach or sales person; it’s 100 to 1, or worse. With odds like that it is no small wonder we don’t occasionally get discouraged. Take it from me, the absolute best thing to do when you trip over your own feet and land in the mud is get up and walk again. I would get crushing news, and be back at it the same hour. It’s just what you have to do.
If I had it to do all over again I would change only two things; I would not take the first opportunity put before me without a lot of prayerful consideration. Many months ago I accepted an offer that looked too good to be true – and, as a matter of fact, it was. Secondly, I would have invested more time preparing interview responses; I spent a disproportionate amount of time on my portfolio packages and not nearly enough practicing for the interview.
If I had to do it all over again there are hundreds of things I would repeat; but only one thing stands out preeminently. I would surround myself with a network of folks waddling in the same clay I’m mucking through. These people have been my confidants, my teammates, and my friends. Nothing can replace a heart-felt, “I understand” from a person who has, and is, where I am. I’m not going to give you the pointers or statistics; frankly they are interesting but not always helpful – but let me leave you with one gem; find others going through what you are in and help them. Not for the expectation of getting something in return, but for the sheer joy that fellowship brings.

CALTRANS RECOGNIZED FOR ITS BICYCLE SUPPORT
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has been recognized for its employees’ achievement of logging 34,681 miles, the most by any employer in the Sacramento region,,” said Caltrans Director Will Kempton, who rode his bike from Folsom to Sacramento on May 17.
Event organizers recognized Caltrans employees Kenny Kwong, who logged the most individual miles -- 2,460 - - and Michael Pope, who rode 1,620 miles, all within the month of May. Pope, a senior bridge engineer, commutes from his home in Auburn to Sacramento twice a week, a round-trip of 92 miles.
In a brief ceremony this month at Caltrans Headquarters, Director Kempton accepted the department’s awards for sponsorship and total miles logged and acknowledged several Caltrans bicyclists for their achievements.

President Obama is living up to his 2009 pledge to use the White House to honor achievers in science as much as in athletics and entertainment — no matter how young the achievers may be. Today he’s hosting the second White House Science Fair — which is essentially a fair of fairs, honoring awardees and leaders in dozens of separate competitions and programs aimed at nurturing the brightest students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics — the collection of disciplines known as STEM in education circles.
There’s more below on the White House event and related announcements by the president.

Transparent Watercolor 18x18 cm
A grey day seemed a good day to paint oranges.
I worked too hard on this one and decided to try a new paper (Yupo) and see if I could get a little more expressive. (see below). Now if I could just get somewhere in the middle!
Transparent watercolor on Yupo 20x24 cm
Painting on yupo is kind of like painting on glass. The paint just slides around and doesn't sink in. Any of my painter friends know of a good source explaining how to paint on this stuff??
I painted these oranges along with other painters on the Virtual Sketch Site.
Visit there to see more.

Both your paintings are just amazing. I like the one on Yupo (no idea what it is). Great fluid effect.
Lovely contrast between the two. I really love the bright blue against the orange. I've never painted on yupo; it reminds me of printmaking techniques.
I think the presentation of the oranges in the top photo is really interesting but the Yupo watercolor is alive and beautiful. I think it's the freshest thing I've seen on Yupo yet.
I too, love both, but really like the Yupo one. I have tried Yupo once and didn't have as much luck as you. I'll be checking back to see what other artists suggest to you for working on it.
Beautiful shapes and colours in this. The fruit just glows. I have tried yupo too but not for anything structured. Its very much trial and error.
Nice watercolor work Carol!
Greetings..
really lovely light in both of these.
I like the Yupo a lot.. Your first attempt is still good :)
color,color,color, just beautiful
I love both versions, the looseness of the Yupo is awesome. It looks so casual and effortlessly done! Bravo!
Both of these are, as they have already said, so beautiful with glowing color. I am trying Yupo now and it is a challenge.
Hey Carol,
I love both interpretations. The dramatic contrast in the first really catches the eye.
I have never tried Yupo but I am often amazed at the results that Sandy Maudlin gets.
(SandyMaudlin.blogspot.com/)
They are both very nice! I like how you glazed the colors on the first one, warm/cool/warm. That gave the background a lot of depth and I'm sure the original glows. I paint 5 or 6 glazes in places. Waiting to see what you do with the house painting.
The first is very dramatic and the light in the second is stunning! I love your addition of the little tag!
I love your orange paintings, especially the Yupo one - very radiant.
gorgeous! the middle ground is the hardest thing to achieve--not too loose, not too tight--in my opinion. I think I heard of an actual book just about watercoloring on Yupo. Try an internet search on that?
I really like the greens you got in the first one and the bright colors of the second.
I think your second attempt (the bottom one) is wonderful. Very exxpressive and loose. Great color. Nice work.
Wow...wow...wow... 'nuff said.
Juicy and yummy...both of these! :)
I like the yupo watercolor too.
Way too many comments for some silly oranges.I don't know how to respond except to say thank you for stopping by and being so nice!
No explanation needed, seeing as you created a terrific painting! However, I do have some great info that I can send you if you like - send me your snail mail address!
Wonderful paintings! I need to break out my Yupo after seeing the second one. Haven't yet tried it, but you've done such a fantastic job with it. How you manage to get such great work from photos is beyond me!
Hi Carol,
I like your well balanced choice of colours, namely the chroma.
When squinting I can also see that you did a good job on those values.
But the feature that I most like is the way that you managed to convey such interesting perpsective.
Kind regards,
José
Your YUPO painting is exquisite. Keep it up!!!!!!

It should be axiomatic that an insurance company is entitled to determine for itself what risks it will accept, and therefore to know all [281 P.2d 39].

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones announced August 19, 2011 occurred.
I understand that California jails are crowded and criminals are being let loose to ease the crowding but running a major fraud ring, in the opinion of ZIFL, requires some real jail time and seizure of the guilty lawyer’s assets. Mr. Jones should not be bragging about this result he should be complaining that the court is being too kind.

Arturo Fonseca, 47; Isis Torres, 37; Francisco Portillo, 41; Eduardo Romero, 44; and William Madrigal, 56, five South Floridians pleaded guilty in Miami federal court to their roles in a massive Medicare fraud scheme.
Fonseca, Torres, Portillo, Romero and were among 26 suspects in three states indicted in December 2009 on charges of running the scheme that totaled $61 million, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. At the plea hearing, Fonseca admitted to being an owner and operator of Courtesy Medical Group Inc., a purported medical clinic in Miami. According to court documents, Courtesy provided medical documents so that the home health agencies could bill the Medicare program for expensive home health services and therapy for beneficiaries that did not need and in some cases did not receive the treatments. According to the indictment, approximately 344 prescriptions were issued through Courtesy and signed by Fonseca’s co-defendant, Dr. Fred Dweck. As a result, the Medicare program was fraudulently billed approximately $16.6 million for home health services. home health care services that were not medically necessary or were not rendered for the patients recruited by Romero and one of his co-defendants. The owners and operators of ABC and Florida Home Health pleaded guilty in a separate case and are awaiting sentencing.
According to plea documents, Portillo and Torres were nurses and falsified patient files for ABC and Florida Home Health to make it appear that the patients qualified for home health care services, when they did not and in some instances never received any treatments. According to court documents, Portillo was responsible for approximately $142,000 in fraudulent Medicare billing and Torres was responsible for approximately $528,400 in fraudulent Medicare billing..
Why are these people allowed to plea to obtain smaller sentences and keep a good chunk of their ill-gotten gains? Is it time for the anti-fraud effort to go nationwide instead of just a few states?

Since 2001 when the Georgia Supreme Court decided State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Mabry, 274 Ga. 498, 556 S.E.2d 114 (Ga. 11/28/2001) the right to recover damages for diminution of value of property even after the damaged property is repaired has been the subject of much litigation. The subject caused concern to the insurance industry, every person insured with a policy of insurance that promised to pay only the cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality, appraisers, adjusters, and lawyers.
Because of the apparent confusion I wrote an E-Book to more thoroughly review how the United States deals with questions of diminution in value. It covers each of the fifty states of the United States, the District of Columbia, the 12 federal Circuit Courts of Appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court, and how they dealt with the issue of establishing the amount of loss to property.
It also covers in detail how each of the jurisdictions dealt with the question of how much an insurer must pay for claims to property the risk of loss of which it insured. It also will explain how much tortfeasors, or their insurers, must pay to those whose property is damaged by their actions.
History of InsuranceSince insurance was invented in ancient Sumeria when insurance policies were written on clay tablets, insurers and their insureds have struggled with establishing a fair method to properly and fairly compensate the person insured for the property lost or damaged as a result of a peril insured against.
Insurance is a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss, damage, or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event. The key question to be answered by an insurer is: How much is needed to indemnify the person insured? The concept of indemnity requires that the person indemnified receives sufficient funds to put him or her back in the financial place he or she was in moments before the loss. The U.S. Supreme Court said: “Indemnity means an obligation to make good a loss...”1 Although, on its face, calculating indemnity seems to be a simple task, as the cases in the are reviewed the reader should be in a position to understand why diminution in value is a concept that has given litigants, insurers and courts serious problems and what seems to be a constant deluge of litigation.
Measure of DamagesThe measure of damages should be that amount necessary to compensate the injured party for the damages proximately caused by the conduct of the person causing injury.2 The measure is often difficult to determine. The measure seldom fits into a hard rule of thumb. Every possible means of providing complete indemnity is required when dealing with tort damages, contract damages, and the proper amounts of payment required by a contract of insurance.
The courts of the various states and federal jurisdictions do not use identical rules to calculate the proper measure of damages. To understand the issue and to apply the proper remedy requires an understanding of how each state applies, what it believes to be, the proper measure of damages for tort, for contract breaches and for insurance claims situations. Although each court should reach the result of true indemnity the same way diversity of opinion is the rule rather than the exception.
For example, automobile insurance policies usually promise to pay the insured, when an automobile is damaged by collision or some other insured cause, the costs to repair the vehicle or if unrepairable, the actual cash value of the vehicle. Most policies say nothing about the difference in value of a vehicle that is repaired after an accident. Because the policies were silent and only promised repair or actual cash value, insurers decided it was unnecessary to even mention the difference in value before the accident and the value after repairs. Since no promise was made to pay for more than actual cash value or the cost of repair the issue was ignored until the 2001 decision of the Georgia Supreme Court in State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Mabry, 274 Ga. 498, 556 S.E.2d 114 (Ga. 11/28/2001). Mabry caused serious concern among insurers. It awarded the insured both the cost to repair and the diminution in value of the car after it was repaired. Insurers believed this decision was a judicial rewriting of the wording of the policy and generated suits across the country seeking recovery for diminution of value in suits against insurers and third-party-defendants.
Since Mabry, virtually all of the courts finding no coverage for diminution of value have done so because the word “repair” has a plain meaning that does not encompass repair of diminished market value after the repair is completed. Rather, the plain meaning of repair contemplates physical restoration. Many insurers, to avoid argument, now add wording to their policies that establishes that the insurer does not intend to, nor will it, pay for diminution of value.
When property of any kind is damaged and repaired the resale value of the property can easily be diminished because of the stigma carried by the repair. An automobile is likely to suffer this type of diminution in value after it is damaged in an accident and repaired. The resale value most likely will be less than that for a comparable automobile that has not been damaged. In other words, the damage results in a reduction — or “diminution”— in the resale value of the automobile. On the other hand, when real property is repaired replacing old material with new the resale value of the real property is often increased. No one, however, has suggested that the insurer or tortfeasor is entitled to a reduction in its payment for repair because the insured profits from the repair and is not, therefore, truly indemnified.
When the property is insured, the insured’s claim for this reduction in value may be made against a third party that negligently caused the damage to the insured’s automobile or it may arise from a first-party claim against the insured’s own physical damage coverage. The key to recovery of the diminution in value depends on the particular state where the damage occurs, the wording of the insurance policy involved, mandates by state insurance departments, and the holding of the various courts.
With regard to first-party claims by a person insured against an insurer, while it is perhaps arguable, the ISO contract language — specifically the Limit of Liability condition — appears to cover only the actual cash value of the damage or the actual cost to repair the damage, some states require payment of additional sums to indemnify the owner for loss in value. Although there is nothing in the policy wording that even appears to contractually cover any reduction in market value, some courts require that the insurer pay extra. Even if the insured could prove the amount of reduction in value collecting from an insurer should require a change in the policy wording.
The policy usually allows the insurer to deduct for “betterment” or depreciation, although the burden of proof is on the insurer to demonstrate such depreciation or betterment. In physical damage claims, the policy would allow the carrier to deduct for an “improvement” in value (i.e., betterment) due to repairs with newer parts, but will not compensate the insured for a reduction in value due to the same accident.
Third-party claims (claims against an insured person for damages done to the property of some third person) for “diminution of value”, on the other hand, have generally been found by the courts to be covered by auto insurance, since the measure of damage in tort claims (which the insurer promises to pay) is the difference in value of the property before the loss and the value of the property after the loss.
For example, Texas court cases have found that legal liability for third-party damages includes diminution of value. However, no single measure of damages can serve in every case to adequately compensate an injured party.3 For the award of damages to be fair, recognizing that diminution of value is not always accurate, an award of restoration damages, according to some courts, must be available to compensate a plaintiff fully for damages to property when diminution in value fails to provide an adequate remedy.4
The general rule in tort cases where one party causes damage to the property of another the measure of damages is not the cost of repair of the property but, rather, the standard measure is the difference between the value of the property before and after the injury, or the diminution in value,5 unless the cost of repairing the injury and restoring the premises to their original condition amounts to less than the diminution in value of the property, and then the cost of repair is the proper measure of damages. If the cost of restoration will exceed such diminution in value, then the diminution in value of the property is the proper measure. That rule seems to be in flux and most courts seem to be moving toward a more flexible rule where the measure of damages is considered the amount necessary to compensate the injured party for the damages proximately caused by the conduct of the person causing injury regardless of the method used to calculate those damages.
There is a disparity between the various states on the subject. Some apply the rules strictly, some apply the general rule of fairness while others apply the rule in one way when dealing with tort damages, another when dealing with contract damages and a third when dealing with insurance claims. The following is a review of how the various states deal with the issue of the proper measure of damages to achieve complete indemnity.
In this new E-Book you will find explanations of how diminution in value is handled across the country with cases (including the full text of many) from each of the fifty states, Guam, the District of Columbia and all federal courts.

Steps Taken By The Malaysian Government To Reduce Road Pollution
In Malaysia, most vehicles and motorcycles run on either petrol or diesel. The above causes pollution of the atmosphere. Engines of the above vehicles emit carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, thus polluting the earth’s surroundings.
The price of petrol has been rising by leaps and bounds. Not only will the price of fuel escalate to a level that is beyond the means of consumers that is motorists of the world, petrol will deplete one day. Its supply will eventually run out. Besides that, is the more serious problem, which the world faces today. Pollution of the earth’s atmosphere is a major concern of environmentalists.
The world as a whole should seriously consider the problem of our atmosphere’s pollution, especially by vehicles. Over the years, the authorities, which are the government, have become very concerned with the problem of carbon monoxide emission by vehicles.
A few years ago, in Malaysia, we used to have diesel powered vehicles, especially buses, lorries, vans and trailers. These are termed as “commercial vehicles”. Inspite of the fact that diesel powered vehicles are cheaper to run and operate, its road tax is 4 to 5 times more expensive than petrol driven vehicles. Diesel engine vehicles are said to pollute the atmosphere more than petrol driven vehicles.
In line with the intention to reduce pollution of the atmosphere, very recently, the government took steps to discourage the use of 2 stroke engine motorcycles, especially Yamaha and Suzuki motorbikes from the Malaysian market.
Such motorbikes were said to pollute the atmosphere more than bikes which were powered by 4 stroke engines. Honda motors were said to use 4 stroke technology as compared to their counterparts. It is thus said to be a cleaner engine.
The above message by the government was passed on to Suzuki and Yamaha agents in Malaysia, to enable producers of the above motorcycles in Japan to take the necessary precautions needed to switch over to the production of vehicles which adhere more towards 4 stroke engine technologies.
Pertaining to diesel powered vehicles, steps have also been taken to ensure that diesel powered vehicles were to be phased out from the market with the aim of protecting the earth’s atmosphere.
Besides the above steps, vehicles with other means of propulsion, like “solar” powered vehicles, were introduced into the Malaysian market. Unfortunately, such types of vehicles met with little success. Not only were such vehicles costly to produce and were too bulky.
Malaysia, although a hot tropical country, at times faced an unreliable supply of sunlight from time to time. As readers are aware, solar powered vehicles cannot do with such unreliable supply of sunlight even for a short span of time.
Of late, “hybrid” cars were gradually being introduced into the Malaysian market. Toyota, Honda and lately Ford, have taken steps to introduce such types of vehicles into Malaysia. The government on its part, has done its role to switch over to hybrid and electric cars.
Hybrid cars run on a combination of petrol and battery power. Such cars are infact rather expensive. When first introduced into Malaysia some few years ago, such cars bordered around RM150,000 per unit.
For your information, my own brother-in- law, a Mr. Ooi, was amongst one of the first few motorists in Malaysia to secure a hybrid vehicle, a Honda model, I was told it costs Mr. Ooi some RM135,000 to obtain the above car. Since then, the government has taken concrete steps to reduce the government excise duty, “ad valorem”, I think, with the view of encouraging the usage of such cars.
Today, the above hybrid Honda model is available at a price of around RM120,000. It is anticipated that such models of vehicles will even cost lower with the passage of time.
Speaking about hybrid cars, another famous and well known producer of such vehicles in Malaysia, Toyota Motors, has of late, been importing hybrid cars into our country. My bro-in-law, Mr. Ooi tells me, steps are also taken to introduce cars into Malaysia soon.
Before Japan was unfortunately hit by the 9.0 earthquake, followed by the disastrous tsunami which followed, my son-in-law, Kin, became the proud owner of his long awaited Toyota Prius. It cost my son-in-law a sum of nearly RM130,000 for the hybrid car. It is believed that he certainly derive extreme and immeasurable pleasure in driving the above car in the years to come.
A clear message has been sent to tunnel operators to start monitoring pollutants that have been, until this point, ignored, and to make information more accessible to the public in order to reduce mistrust.
Yes, it is required to change the engines of most of the vehicles, as they are generating a lot of pollution, where as citizens health will get spoiled. So the Malaysian govt should take get involved to reduce the road pollution.

The important task of archiving the historical and internationally acclaimed AIAS work has been completed – both the and sites (National Library of Wales and British Library) provide a complete backup in the event of any local computer failure. I tested the system this morning and downloaded about 150 UFT papers in about half an hour off. Not only is AIAS producing the new physics but it is the leading institute of theroetical physics in the world. This statement can be proven in many ways and in great detail using feedback, which is why I study feedback as part of the overall educational task. I think of AIAS as the scientific part of the real Prifysgol Cymru or University of Wales, showing the true ability of the People of Wales, however badly it is treated. I am a fluent Welsh speaker who has produced vastly more work than anyone in the insignificant remnants that call themselves “universities” in long suffering Wales. I am interested in working at the Aberystwyth science park and with anyone who wishes to establish a true Prifysgol Cymru in which all staff are either Welsh speakers or in favour of the language, not just out for themselves by appointing themselves. As a Pensioner of the Civil List, employed directly by Queen Elizabeth II, I distance myself completely from all the corruption, as I have always done. That is why I was locked out for life and denied salary. I would have resigned in protest at the corruption anyway, retaining only my historical Scientiae Doctor degree, the youngest in modern history. I am proud and pleased at the outstanding performance of the AIAS staff and all associates.

second one: not my thing but at least it ain't 14 minutes long
geographer - shell beach (not my favourite track on the album but i really enjoy the repetitive guitar riff)
a whisper in the noise - black shroud (random song pick off the album because they're all glorious)
first one:
would probably react with great wonder and joy were this to play during a TV serial, which is the sort of place I'd expect to find it - good, rousing indie
second one: well that was nice, swelling stuff, probably fares best when well-worn, like a favourite scarf
agreed on all counts :)
Villalobos ~ Put Your Lips
Moomin ~ Beautiful As You Are
#1 - Villalobos slowly shakes everything loose around the 'Put Your Lips, Put Your Lips, Put Your Lips...' hook. Shouldn't be half as infectious as it is.
#2 - Like walking through spring rain, just wait for the sultry sax to kick in.
Villalobos one is kinda...Autechre-y
Early period Autechre but still. Is this where deep house meets ambient? For maximum enjoyment I might need some visual accompaniment, or a very unified nightclub
2 is pleasingly polyrhythmic, and yes, vernal. Hypnotic. In short, music I'd expect Chris Morris to include on a fourth series of Blue Jam
Gravenhurst - Three Fires
Daniel Rossen - Silent Song
Gravenhurst
with a name like that I was expecting some Demdike-Stare-esque Ghost-Box-isms but it's a dude with an acoustic waxing wistful on my ass.
Rossen...classic poprock vibe...gaaah it's not 100% my thing. Think I'll quit reviewing EVERY song on this list, just the ones I really like!
What I like about Gravenhurst is how well he manages to mix whimsy with malice
it shouldn't work but there's a sad-yet-sinister vibe to his stuff that I love.
The second one isn't normally something I'd be into (it's the dude from Grizzly Bear, who've never really done it for me) but I really like that song. It's just kinda burrowed it's way into my brain and refuses to leave.
Can everyone make like me or ethricdouble and provide a line's pithy description for each track, too?
cheeeeeers
Done!
hey guys
Ty Segall - Scissor People - pretty groovy garage rock but posting mainly for the cool cutup bit that comes from nowhere after about two minutes and flips around the speakers
Awol - Amen
This just has a cool beat and some mint metallic sax honking
hahaha
it's like Eye joined White Denim for ten seconds
awesommmmme
anything involving Micachu is going to have at least some greatness...let's see...
:D
:D :D
fucking exquisite
I love those horn sounds
They are the sort of sounds that would drive some people to distraction!
I wish plug.dj actually worked again so we could do this sort of thing in factual real time, it's a bit more fun.
We need an alternative!
Motorpsycho and Ståle Storløkken - Into The Mystic
Mahavishnu Orchestra meets Dungen? idk
...meets Danava meets Jaga Jazzist meets Rainbow IN VALHALLA
Its a mammoth of a tune.
I think you'd really like late period Motorpsycho (probably the early stuff too), Heavy Metal Fruit would be right up your alley I reckon.
yeah it certainly needs more of a delve
Have you heard Danava, on the other hand? I reckon you'd approve...
I hadn't, but hunted down a youtube after I saw
you mentioned them here. Seems like Id like them. Added 3 albums to my 'to listen to' playlist in spotify. Which one first?
Unouno or however it's spelt is the one I have
it's got a couple of absolute screamers on it, The Emerald Snow Of Sleep and *especially* One Mind Gone Separate Ways, which might be the zenith of the whole trad-freak-psych wave
you listen to that goat record boyos?
I need to, it seems.
sweden got that good shit
holy mother of god
this is the heavy shit
The bass tone is gnarly.
OMGSW
sounds sooo similar to Ulysses Last Stand (minus Bonhams best playing ever) that I'm not sure I can separate it and dissect it. Liking that other one though.
*Achilles Last Stand
WITH MORE BLEEPS
Yeah not like its a pure cover or something,
just the melody on the vocals and the backing track. Sorry mate, I cant un-hear it now.
That Pre-New album is bloody brilliant
playing that lots at the moment.
In response to the OP. I should probably link two songs as well, maybe later.
okay
ricardo villalobos - emilio
1st half sounds like a computer having a coughing attack from laughing too much and the 2nd half sounds like it slowly losing conciousness and dying.
joy orbison - elipsis
didn't really get this track until i was sitting in the sun enjoying a cold one. late sunny vibes with a surprisingly catchy vocal sample. the pianos turn it from a jacking house track into a 21st century rave anthem
probably fire's highway by japandroids twice
Love this song/album.
Going to see them in November, maybe the only gig I will have going to this year :/
oh where is this?
Scottsdale, Arizona, USA
alright then i won't go see them
Come on over man,
you can crash at my place, got an extra room for you.
I stopped off in Phoenix once
It was so fucking hot. I pretty much just sat under the air conditioning for the day.
That's about alls you can do in the summer.
3 months of hell but the rest is prime time.
I was waiting on a new rental car
I decided to walk a couple of miles down the road to get a cable from best buy. Nearly died. It was like 42 degrees or something :/
I'll save my next visit for the winter.
Had to break out the fahrenheit converter. yeah 108
is pretty normal really, gets up in the low 120s sometimes (49 celsius)
if i start swimming now
i'll just about make it
Pretty good pick if you only get to go to one
Incredible both times I saw them this year.
Def excited, cant wait to fist pump like mad
and belt out all those hooks with the bros.
I WILL HAVE GOING
ffs
i think that kids are gonna be discovering and falling in love with japandroids
for the next 30 years. they're perfect. going seeing them toward end of october... might take a pile of mdma, see if it's possible to levitate from happiness.
I WILL HAVE GOING SEEING THEM
'The House That Heaven Built' for me.
I actually, physically, cannot listen to it just the once. I have to play it over and over again until I'm jumping about screaming the lyrics.
IF THEY TRY TO SLOW YOU DOWN
(slow you doooooooowwnn)
TELL THEM ALL TO GO TO HELL
tbf
i've been madly in love with that song too, and younger us, and most everything they've recorded. there are only 6 tracks across both of their proper records that i haven't starred on spotify at some, indubitably drunken, point.
Haha yeah I know the feeling.
I've never known a band, except maybe the Pogues, so perfectly suited for whiskey drinking. By the early hours of the morning everyone in the room is just chanting the lyrics and falling all over the place. If I develop a liver problem when I'm older I'm blaming them.
^ Might have just sold me the album.
I listened on Spotify but wasn't convinced.
I think I'll love it when I'm driving or nor writing lesson plans in front of a laptop.
While lesson planning? :D
I just have an image of you now pumping the air and chanting everything while a load of teenagers stare on in bemusement.
*Having a wank when I should be lesson-planning
^^^how DiS' favourite convict came to be
That's the mainstream pick though, you see.
(but yeah, totally agree)
BUT YOUR NOT MINE TO DIE FOR ANYMORE
SO I MUST LIII-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIVVVVVVVEEEEE.
Gonna be listening to this all night now. Again.
*YOU'RE
I WILL HAVE GOING SEEING THEM.
Japandroids > Grammar
Seen Japandroids 2x
and never gets boring :)
HELLO
The Company Band - The House of Capricorn
Hey it's yer man from Clutch and Fu Manchu doing that really strutting, hard ROCK and or roll. Fallon has the best voice ever.
Officers - Co-Education
Bit With Teeth-era, style Nine Inch Nails, awesomely heavy synths.
I love me some Fallon but I can't seem to get into The Company Band
I think I underestimated how important John Paul Gaster's weird ass grooves are to the Clutch sound.
Great idea for a thread.
Angel Haze - New York - I literally love everything about this song from the handclaps and clicks to the references to ashy feet.
El-P (and Mister MFN Exsquire and Danny Brown) - Oh Hail No - The Exsquire verse is brilliant and Danny Brown went from being somebody I thought looked weird to somebody I think is brilliant. That line about, "I like the part where you cry/ I like nothing else" in the El-P bit is also great.
<3 NY
Here are 2.
Frozen - Tindersticks
So it's Tindersticks with everything great (IMO) that that brings, but with drums and atmosphere that takes what they are about into a whole different place.
Lone - Raindance
It's quite ravey, but quite ambient and the drums are just Machinedrum-y good.
Jogging - Deadweight
I can't think of a second one so Future Of The Left - Failed Olympic Bid will do nicely
Maybe I should have just linked to another Jogging song instead.
Here's 2 more....
Bob Mould- The Descent (Live on Letterman)- true return to Sugar-era form in all respects.
This is from Black Twig's album Paper Trees released earlier this year and eternally on repeat since I got it....shoegazey joy

Those involved in “deliverance ministries” say it is necessary to bind Satan in the unsaved in order to give the gospel. “The experienced deliverance minister can compel evil spirits to tell the truth. I do so all the time….To evangelize the demonized we must learn how to bind demonic activity from the minds of demonized unbelievers” (Ed Murphy, We Are at War pages 51 and 58).
Charles Ryrie believes that Christians can be temporarily demon possessed (or have the base of operations within the believer). Ryrie is weak on this issue stating “the argument against a believer’s being able to be demon possessed is often based on the fact of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the believer’s heart. In other words, since the Spirit indwells the believer, it is impossible for Satan or demons also to indwell and thus possess the believer at the same time. But do not the Spirit and the flesh war within the believer? (Gal. 5:16-17) If it be argued that the old man has been judge (Rom. 6:6), it may also be pointed out that Satan has been judged too (John 12:31). So if Spirit and flesh, the new and old, can be present within the believer at the same time, why cannot the Spirit and Satan (or demons)?” (Basic Theology, page 167).
The problem is not between the Spirit and the inanimate principle of the old nature dwelling together in the believer but the problem is the Holy Spirit dwelling in a believer with another evil person like a demon. 1 John 4:4 assures us “greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”
The following verses are used to argue that believers can be demon possessed: (1 Sam. 16:13-14; Lk. 13:11-16; 1 Cor.5:5; 2 Cor. 12:7; Acts 5:3). Ryrie makes another mistake by citing Ananias who allowed Satan to fill his heart. “Since there is no reason not to believe that Ananias was a believer, here is a clear statement that Satan did fill the heart of a believer. Nothing is said about demons here, though presumably if Satan filled his heart, demons could have also….Neither Satan nor demons can permanently indwell a believer nor ultimately have victory over him” (pages 167-168).
One weakness of Ryrie’s argument is to assume to be filled by Satan equals demon possession. To be filled in Scripture means to be controlled as believers who are filled or controlled by the Holy Spirit or the Pharisees who were filled or controlled by envy toward Christ. Dr. Ryrie does not give any Scripture for this view. Ryrie argues against permanent demon possession from 1 John 5:18 and John 20:17.
There are persuasive arguments against believers being demon possessed. None of the verses used to prove believers can be demon possessed are convincing. The Trinity would not share their abode in believers with demons.
Christ is in every believer (Col.1:27). The Holy Spirit is in every believer (1 Cor. 6:19-20) as a matter of fact, the entire Trinity is in every believer (John 14:23). How can such conflicting personalities dwell in the same person?

WOONSOCKET, R.I. and MAITLAND, Fla. —.
Under the agreement, FHMG physicians will serve as medical directors for 12 MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics inside select CVS/pharmacy stores in Orlando and the surrounding counties of Lake, Orange, Osceola, Polk and Seminole.
MinuteClinic and FHMG also will collaborate on patient education and disease management initiatives. FHMG and Florida Hospital will accept patients requiring a level of care outside the scope of MinuteClinic's walk-in services for common illnesses, wellness and prevention services, including health condition monitoring.
"MinuteClinic joins Florida Hospital Medical Group in its commitment to help patients remain healthy by making high-quality, cost-effective medical care more accessible in Central Florida," stated Andrew Sussman, president of MinuteClinic and SVP/associate chief medical officer for CVS Caremark. "Florida Hospital has a long tradition of forging successful community partnerships, and we look forward to having their physicians collaborate with our nurse practitioners to provide quality oversight, teaching and backup so we can provide the best care at the lowest overall cost."
MinuteClinic and FHMG also will work toward fully integrating electronic medical record systems to streamline communication around all aspects of patients' care. In the meantime, MinuteClinic will continue its standard practice of sending patient visit summaries to primary care providers via fax or mail, typically within 24 hours of the visit.
"Our goal is to supplement the efficient and convenient care already provided by MinuteClinic with additional support and clinical expertise, which will improve primary care access for our community and expand our continuum of care," stated Neil Finkler, chief medical officer of FHMG. "This partnership will streamline patient care communication and facilitate access to FHMG practitioners for patients in need of further medical care."

I’m 43; I’ve been practicing voluntary simplicity for over a decade and currently practice non-extreme minimalism. But I’m also a professor, which means everything is subject to critical analysis and questioning … including the things I believe in. Which leads to this post….
Is U.S.-style minimalism well-adapted to the Great Recession?
It sounds like a strange question, since many minimalists talk about the ways in which their lifestyle keeps them frugal, mobile, and adaptable. Certainly those are all desirable traits during an economic downturn. But…
Most U.S.-style minimalists keep nothing but that which they use or love, and extreme minimalists want to pare their possessions down to what can fit into the trunk of a car or a backpack. The minimalist lifestyle is predicated on avoiding the accumulation of excess; it’s a lifestyle based on just-in-time delivery rather than redundancy and stockpiling. (Note: I’m using “U.S.-style” to characterize the messages of the best-known minimalist bloggers right now, most of whom are U.S. citizens; some are “rational” and some are “extreme,” but none are survivalists.)
Survivalists and homesteaders, on the other hand, accumulate everything they might need to live off the grid and prefer plenty of backup and redundancy. Generators, food supplies, extra freezers, emergency kits, gardening/farming tools, canning/preserving equipment, camping gear, hunting supplies, homeschooling supplies — survivalists store whatever they think will get them through a long-term emergency situation in which they can no longer rely on government to provide basic services. True, extreme minimalist survivalists may need little more than a knife and their foraging skills to get by, but that’s more a case of short-term personal survival rather than long-term rebuilding-after-the-crash survival.
So, is the minimalist or the survivalist better-suited to life at a time when towns are closing down public libraries; shortening school weeks, curtailing public transportation services, reducing or outsourcing police services, and turning off streetlights? If that sounds fanciful, read Friday’s article in the New York Times, “Governments Go to Extremes as the Downturn Wears On” or the Wall Street Journal’s article “Cities Rent Police, Janitors to Save Cash. Minimalists often argue that they don’t need to own certain things (e.g., books, cars) because they can find alternatives in the public sphere … but what happens when those public services are cut back due to lack of funds?
I’ve thought about the minimalism vs. survivalism question a bit myself. When I critiqued extreme minimalism, I pointed out that emergency items like fire extinguishers, medical kits, snow chains, and earthquake survival kits were seldom listed in extreme minimalists’ possessions, yet they can make the difference between life and death when they’re needed. And I think about it whenever I hear about another public library closing down, since I visit my own library several times a week. I thought about it when I read The Things That Keep Us Here by Carla Buckley, a novel about an H1N5 pandemic and a family trapped in its suburban house as society collapses. And I thought about it again yesterday, when my grocery store’s credit/debit-processing computers went down and I had to wait for them to be fixed before I could buy food.
What if? What if the electricity were out for several days or more? Access to the web and to digital telephone services would be lost once batteries died and couldn’t be recharged; ATMs wouldn’t function; debit and credit cards wouldn’t run, schools and businesses would close, and suddenly not having a stockpile of candles or firewood, matches, canned or preserved food that can be eaten cold, and other supplies would make a big difference. What if the water supplies were cut off? What if an earthquake or flood cut off the main roads, stopping deliveries of food and other goods? Or the price of gasoline just got so high that business began to stop deliveries themselves, deciding only to pursue sales in the most profitable regions of the country? Or a serious flu outbreak hit us, the way it did in 1918, and the public infrastructure quietly collapses as a third of the population falls ill?
Miss Minimalist argued that in a serious emergency situation, she’d have to strap on a backpack and get out of Dodge. Are most minimalists in this position?
I enjoy the minimalist lifestyle, but I think the question of whether one can be a typical U.S.-style minimalist and still be prepared for an emergency — or just for further cutbacks in social services — is worth discussion. What is a minimalist’s greatest priority? Owning less … or surviving an emergency? Can we do both? How?

I think minimalist are people who live within the norms of society.
Survivalist are people waiting for society to collapse, therefore they are living outside the norms of society.
Me I am a minimalist. There has never been a time in my life where society collapsed. The minimalist lifestyle can accommodate the occasional Katrina, New Orleans, because as a minimalist you’re more set up as a potential nomadic lifestyle and can move with mobility.

So I watched the Duke vs the U game last night and let me tell you, it may have been the best college basketball game I have ever seen in my life. Duke just imploded and Miami was on fire and stayed on fire the entire game. Which begs my question is a 90- 63 loss the worst loss by a number 1 team ever?
I'm not going to look it up, but just assume it has to be. I don't want to hear any Duke fans say, "Well Ryan Kelly was out," because that's bullshit, Ryan Kelly wouldn't have changed the outcome of this game.
Miami was blazing hot and went 57% shooting for the whole night and basically 50% from the line. That is also with their best big man Reggie Johnson being extremely limited due to a broken thumb (that he somehow recovered in 4 weeks, doesn't make sense). Duke as a team shot 29% which is a lot better than their 18% they shot in the first half.
Seth Curry went 0-10 with 0 points and Quinn Cook went 1-12. And at one point in the first half Miami went on a 25-1 run. It was a thing of beauty.
4 comments:
Well, Ryan Kelly was out.
No way Ryan Kelly would have made up that difference.
Miami also played with a hobbled star
I was joking. The absence of Ryan Kelly did not make Seth Curry go 0'fer. Duke missed some open shots early and then it totally snowballed from there, including some very lazy defense. Also give Miami some credit. They played their asses off!
I really like that Gamble kid, hes like a tough SOB like Reggie Evans

wrote for Dungeon’s Master. All of the examples came from actual events that took place at my gaming table. And in the months since I wrote this article, I’ve seen all of these things happen over and over again whenever I play with new gamers.
My intent with this article was to highlight (in a humourous way) the dumb things we’ve all done as PCs. If you avoid making even one of these mistakes after reading this, then I’ve done my job.
A few of these tips and reminders are less pertinent today then they were when this article was first published thanks to Character Builder. Since Character Builder does all of the math for you, you’re a lot less likely to miss or forget modifiers.
If I had to add #11 to this list it would be to use your daily powers every day. But as a more general reminder, the only other piece of advice I’d offer is to just play intelligently. It’s the stupid things that get your PC into trouble.
From February 11 and 24, 2009, Dungeon’s Master once again presents: Avoiding Death (Part 1 | Part 2).
I think it’s fair to say that everyone who plays D&D has experienced character death at some point. Hopefully your character has gone down swinging or sacrificed himself in such a way that people will be telling and retelling the story for years to come. But in reality I think we all know that more often than not character death is the result of someone (often the character himself) doing something stupid.
Here are 10 way to avoid character death.
Don’t chase monsters.
Know you character.
Check for traps every time.
Take a short break.
Pay attention.
Be quiet.
Move strategically.
Try diplomacy.
Work together.
Get out of the way.
As your sword bites deep in the monsters flesh again and again you know that the end is near. One good, solid blow and the beast will be defeated. Or it would be if it didn’t just turn and run. No matter, I’ll follow it to the ends of hell to get this kill.
Also know as bloodlust. How often does one monster just refuse to die? And how often does one character (usually a Fighter) feels it’s his duty to kill it before it escapes. This may be (arguably) good role playing, but from a mechanics perspective it’s just stupid. If the monster flees the battle you still get full XP for defeating it. Let it go! Otherwise you may end up fighting the monster one-on-one, without help from your party, and it may kill you.
This monster can’t have too many hit points left. I’ll bet one more hit will drop it. My attack modifier is +7 so I need to roll 13 or more to hit AC 20. Damn! I rolled a 12, missed by 1. With 1 hit point remaining, the monster attacks the party and Nenia the Wizard is killed. Oh, damn! I forgot to add that +1 feat bonus. My attack should have hit (and killed) the monster. Sorry about that Nenia.
It’s important to know your character and understand when situational modifiers apply. Become familiar with the descriptions of your weapons, magical items, feats and powers to ensure you’re getting all the bonuses you deserve. And never underestimate the importance of checking your math – especially after you level.
As the party moves deeper into the dungeon they come upon another door. Ethan the Rogue begins checking for traps. “I’m sick of all this waiting,” yells Braddoc the Fighter. “I’m going in.” Pushing Ethan aside, Braddoc opens the door. Fortunately Braddoc’s prized Battle Axe has a strong enchantment and it survives the explosion. Braddoc is not so lucky.
This seems like a no-brainer, but many characters die needlessly this way. It can get monotonous for the Rogue to check every single door for traps before entering, but unless you have a damn good reason not to then let the Rogue do his job. The great thing about 4e is that other characters can assist with most skill checks. So just because the Rogue is making the primary check doesn’t mean the rest of the party can’t take turns assisting.
We just defeated eight skeletons, two ghouls, and one specter. We used most of our encounter powers and everyone’s used their second wind. We’re bloodied and tired. I’m just going to open this door a crack and see what’s in the next room. Uh oh.
Never underestimate the value of a short rest. This gives you time to use heal, replenish encounter powers and allow the use of more action points. But, if the party is forgetful (or stupid) and moves on without taking a short rest they begin the next encounter already down a peg or two. The few times I’ve seen this happen characters have died needlessly.
DM – Your turn, Braddoc.
Braddoc – I swing at the monster with my Great Axe. Does 15 hit?
DM – Not quite. The monster swipes at you with its giant claws. What’s you’re AC?
Braddoc – 17
DM – That hits. You take 10 points of damage and suffer the ongoing affects of poison until you save.
Braddoc – That did it. I’m below 0 hit points and fall unconscious.
Merric – Did you remember to add +3 to the attack roll that Sterling provided from his use of Warlord’s Favor?
Braddoc – No.
Merric – Did you remember to add +3 to your AC from the Priest’s Shield I just used?
Braddoc – No
Merric – Then I’m not healing you.
Just because it’s not your turn doesn’t mean you can tune out. Many 4e powers offer bonuses to other characters. You need to be aware of what’s happening so that you get every advantage afforded your character. Likewise be sure to inform the party of bonuses you offer them due to your race, class or feats.
The party quietly crept through the castle hallway. They knew the king’s private bedchamber was just around the next corner. With any luck they could catch him unaware and he wouldn’t have time to prepare adequate defenses. As Ethan the Rogue is about to turn the corner he hears “Get ready, men. They’ll be here any second.” “Damn, how did they know we were coming?” Ethan thought momentarily as he eyed his companions in plate, scale, and chain armor. “Noisy clods!”
Wearing big, bulky armor and carrying a shield gives you a great AC, but the check penalty really kills your Stealth score. Even so, Stealth should not be automatically ruled out. The Fighter, Paladin and Cleric may not be suitable for silent movement but most other classes are. Anyone with a reasonable Dexterity and no armor check penalty can be sneaky. Let them scout ahead before the guy in armor announces your presence. Knowing what lies around the next corner (before it knows you’re there) lets you devise a quick strategy before combat begins.
Sterling the Warlord observes the battlefield and directs his companions. “Braddoc, you and I will move up together with you in the lead and fight the first monster. Ethan, try to get around them and flank with Braddoc.” Ethan sneaks behind the monster and is ready to move in for the kill. Sterling and Braddoc begin moving, but Braddoc suddenly takes a turn to the right and charges a different foe. “Braddoc, where are you going?” Sterling asks. “The big one is going down,” Braddoc says as he charges through the battlefield.
Your movement should make sense. Do you have a power that will benefit an ally adjacent to you or adjacent to the target? Do you get any bonuses (like sneak dice) against an opponent granting combat advantage? Then move to flank. If you can move and gain combat advantage, why wouldn’t you? Take the +2 to hit! Or move so that the party striker can flank more easily. Moving into the right square can make a huge difference to you, the party and the outcome of combat. Try to anticipate where your allies are going to move or just ask them. Work together. Haphazard movement makes things more difficult for everyone, combat takes longer and characters die.
As the giant flying monster lands in front of the party, claws raised and razor sharp teeth ready to bite, it speaks. “This is my forest. Why should I forgive such trespass?” “Charge!” cries Braddoc the Fighter as he runs forth. “I’ll earn lots of XP for this kill,” he thinks as he charges into combat.
Every character has Diplomacy, Bluff and Intimidate on their character sheet. Combat is not your only option! Many monsters are highly intelligent. Try talking your way out of a problem rather than rushing headlong into combat. A successfully parley will often yield just as much XP as killing the creature.
Dire wolves circle the party, outnumbering the PCs 2-to-1. Each PC moves to attack the nearest wolf. Many wolves are wounded, but none are killed. Now the wolf pack, still boasting its superior numbers moves in for a coordinated attack, killing Nenia the Wizard and Merric the Cleric.
How often does your party split up and take on multiple threats simultaneously rather than focus all your efforts on just one target? As long as a monster has 1 hp it can still attack you, so softening up three at once isn’t as useful as working together to kill one in the first round. Talk to each other and describe what you want to do on your turn so others can go with it. Designate a combat leader and let them direct the party. One vision yields higher efficiency and saves lives.
The kobold horde hesitates before attacking with their superior numbers and overwhelming the PCs. That hesitation is all Braddoc needs. He charges into the mass of kobolds and starts swinging his mighty Battle Axe. “Get out of the way, Braddoc” yells Nenia. “I’m going to drop a fireball on the entire horde.” Braddoc ignores the advice of his companion and keeps swinging away as the kobolds swarm him. “Oh well, I warned him,” Nenia says as she casts Fireball engulfing 10 kobolds and Braddoc.
If your party has ranged attacks or large area spells, then make sure you don’t hinder you party’s ability to use them. Don’t rush needlessly in between two monsters. Tell the party where you’re planning to move and if the Wizard says to wait one round then listen to him. The alternative is that you end up being subjected to the spell just like the monsters.

Another hint: do not fire an arrow at a demon +9 levels higher than your character, while perched 80 feet high on a building.
Let’s just say take my word for it :]
@Ray Wenderlich
I think that definitely falls under my general advice of “play intelligently” and “avoid doing anything stupid.” But picking a fight with a creature that is clearly more powerful than you are is not a very good way to avoid death.

To Scarlett, a woman belonging to the world. If I had to lose to anyone, I would want it to be Ryan. He’s a true gentleman. All the best.

It is one thing to have disagreements that may lead to a split, but the fact that Johannsson had her skanky butt all over Sean Penn within a minute of their split is the HUGE red flag that Reynolds needs to open his eyes too. If it is true love, she wouldn’t have spread her legs so quickly and easily… Run Ryan!!

Long ago, there were myths of creatures such as fairies and trolls who stole the children of royalty for various purposes and replaced them with something else. Be it to introduce new blood into the fae ranks or for the sheer pleasure of causing mischief, these surrogates were the greatest fear of the queens of olden times. The nightmarish proxies were known as changelings. Children of fae, enchanted objects, or troll offspring, changelings were believed to resemble a normal human infant however, were said to acquire insatiable appetites, uncommon wisdom, and a malevolent or mischievous nature as they grew. Legend had it that an iron object, such as scissors, placed in or around the crib of an infant would ward off the fairies and keep the little treasure from harm.
The year is now 2019 and whispers of these changelings still linger on the lips of mothers and fathers alike, however the folklore has undergone some cultural alterations, if you will. There is only one king, only one member of royalty in these times, and his only children are the obedient masses that have been trained to bow before his ruthlessness. A Changeling is no longer a fabled being but rather a mysterious organization whose sole purpose is to cause chaos and rustle up a little rebellion. Replacing the tame with the wild, these modern day myths look like every other person, however, beneath their placid facade lays a hidden miscreant whose soul is bot and will never be tamed.
My name is
Deanna Marie Revlen, but you can just call me Puck. If you’re reading this, then I’m either victorious, dead, or worse, a slave to the will of the King. All the people in this story are real, however their names have been changed for their personal safety and yours. I never really meant for any of this to happen, it’s important that you, my dear reader, know that. Blame it on being raised in a broken, but nonetheless free nation, or that stubborn streak that you always read about in books, either way, I just didn’t take too well to subjugation. Servitude simply didn’t fit me like it did the rest, and as I would later find out, there were others who shared my angst. Our story however, begins with something a little less philosophical and a little more reckless; a sparring match, some whiskey, and a couple fractured ribs…
“There’s no way you can beat both of us in a sparring match, kid.” Sneered Talbot as he took a king sized swig from the Jack Daniels bottle the three of us were sharing.
“Sorry sweetheart, he’s right, there ain’t no way.” Falco interjected, motioning for the elixir we all had become reliant on as of late. Both Boston natives, Talbot and Falco had met far before I encountered them eight years ago during my first year in college. Though exactly how they became of acquaintance, I’m still not quite sure, the story changes a little every time they tell it. All I know for certain is that they served in the Marine Corps together and decided to start a dojo post honorable discharge, and that’s where I met them. A curious college freshman with a need to keep healthy, I strolled into the edifice during a sparring match between the two and fell in love with the mixed martial art known as MCMAP. Moments later I had signed up and paid for a years’ worth of training and in the process secured a future, unbeknownst to me at the time, at that very institute and two of the greatest friends a woman could ever ask for.
“I mean you’re good, hell, you probably could beat us individually, but together, we’re just too big for you.” He added, shaking his head vigorously. Falco was the taller and larger of the two, standing at six foot six and consisting of well over two hundred and seventy pounds of pure muscle. His blonde hair was trimmed to Marine regulation and his deep blue eyes shone with a glimmer of arrogance as he sipped from the half empty bottle. Talbot on the other hand, who sat smirking across from me, was of a more slender build. Though could not be considered small by any means, he was more alike to a panther in sharp contrast to the bull like appearance of his larger counterpart, and was a mere six foot three. His veteran body was lean and strong, his dark brown hair was kept just as short as Falco’s and his eyes were of the most elegant emerald green I had ever seen. Both men were in their early thirties and I sat the youngest at the tender age of twenty-five.
Wrenching the whiskey bottle from his hands, a mischievous grin found its way to my lips. It seemed like the greatest idea in the world at the time, taking on two retired Marines in a sparring match, but then again everything seems like a great idea when two and a half bottles of whiskey have been shared between three people within an hour.
“Fifty bucks and a back massage says I can take you two down.” I stated as I rose haphazardly to my feet, whiskey in hand. The two men looked at each other, the money was enticing, but I knew it was the back massage that brought the bet home. As a certified masseuse, among other things (I have eclectic interests, okay?), my back rubs were miracle workers for the guys, they loved them and I had yet to find something they would do for one. Nodding their heads, the two rose to their feet to tower above me. Looking up at them triggered a warning bell in my brain that a five foot six woman like myself had no business sparing with these two monstrous men at the same time but the whiskey screamed oh yes I do, and we all know who I listened to.
Placing the bottle down against the wall, I swallowed my last gulp and took a stance.
“Come on then, or are you afraid of a little girl like me?” and with that, two thoroughly inebriated men came charging at me like angry wildebeests in stampede. Falco caught my round house kick with his face while Talbot landed a solid punch on my lower ribcage, sending a shooting pain up my side. I retaliated with an Aikido take down, flipping him onto the padded livingroom floor. By this time Falco was fully recovered and proceeded to tackle me to the ground in an attempt to pin me and win the match. Thanks to over a decade of yoga and my deep seated stubborn streak, I managed to slip my legs out from under his knees and wrapped them around his head. Compressing his neck and face with my thighs I tensed every muscle in my upper body to flip us over once more only to run straight into Talbots choke hold. I was about to attempt a flip from a seated position when a voice interrupted our match.
“Excuse me, sorry to interrupt but I’m looking for Puck. I have a pressing matter to discuss with her.” The young man inquired, standing in the doorway shrouded in shadow. All three of us stopped in our tacks, quite an awkward position to be stuck in might I add, and stared at the new comer. Perhaps it was the whiskey that had slowed our minds, the fact that it was one in the morning, that our condo had a top of the line security system, or a mixture of the three, but whatever it was, none of us seemed to be processing what exactly was going on.
“Ehhh, what?” I replied after a minute of pure silence.
“Are you Puck?” he asked again, more urgently than before. Nodding my head, I tapped out of Talbots sleeper hold and stood up, lending a hand to Falco as he too rose from the ground.
“Yeah, I’m Puck, who are you and how’d you get in here?” I inquired, as sobriety slowly inched its way into my brain. The man took a step forward, revealing a tuff of disheveled raven curls and a wrinkly plain shirt atop a pair of jean Bermuda shorts that had seen better days. Two stained cotton loafers adorned his abnormally large feet and a leather messenger bag was slung across his willowy shoulders.
“You can call me Amp, and your security is like child’s play for someone like me.” He said dismissively. Judging from his lack of wrinkles and what some would refer to as fashionable clothing, I pegged him at around nineteen, if that. “Sorry for barging in so late by the way, but It couldn’t wait.” He added as if breaking into someone’s home in the middle of the night was a mere unannounced drop in on a Sunday afternoon.
“Alright, Amp, you have two minutes to explain yourself before we give a new meaning to the phrase ‘human pretzel’. Go.” I retorted aggressively as Falco and Talbot edged in front of me protectively. It was a rare day indeed that someone broke into our home and lived, let alone was received in a relatively placid manner such as this. Though I could feel the tension building, my two flatmates severely weary of this stranger, he seemed far too calm to be anything too harmful. That, and the three to one odds.
“Well, I kind of hacked your computer remotely for fun and stumbled on something that was labeled Changeling while perusing your encrypted files. By the way, you really need to update your software, your keys are pathetic. Anyways, I read through it and I want in.” The boy said with a hopeful glint in his eye.
“Changeling? Like the fairytale?” Falco said, a confused frown tugging at his thin mouth.
“They don’t know?” Amp queried, all but ignoring Falco and looking at me as if I were some kind of alien.
“Know what? Puck, what don’t we know? And how does he know your name? Only we call you that. What’s going on?” Inserted Falco before I had time to respond, obviously agitated. If there was one thing that got under his skin, it was being ignored and made to feel stupid; two things this Amp kid had successfully managed to do within two minutes of meeting him.
“Calm down, and give her time to explain.” Talbot’s deep voice quieted the rest of us as he placed his hand on Falco’s shoulder. “She can’t answer if you keep asking questions.” He paused and looked at me, “Now, Puck, tell us what exactly this ‘Changeling’ file is and why this kid ‘wants in’.” Completely dumbfounded and still slightly drunk, I plopped onto the couch and sighed.
“Changeling isn’t just a file, it was a plan I had a long time ago, back when we were still fighting Loki. You know how I like to plan things. See I knew the military wouldn’t take someone like me due the whole missing organ thing, so I designed an organization that would. I was an idealistic college student and thought that a little mischief making would make him understand that some of us aren’t bred to be his pets. I devised Changeling to be an elusive and organized force of miscreants doing everything in their power to inconvenience the King, not to over throw him per say, but just to show that he wasn’t in control… I was young, it would never work.” I elucidated with a sadness in my voice that I had long since forgotten. “Sorry to break it to you kid, but Changeling doesn’t and never will exist.” I added, raising the bottle to my lips once more but before the warm liquid reached my tongue Amp said something I never expected.
“That’s where you’re wrong; it can exist if you are willing to lead it. The plan is solid; the cell system is flawless. I could never start it by myself, because this is not my masterpiece, but I’m good with technology like you’ve never seen though.” The boy replied. Confused, I looked up at my two best friends expecting to see stern faced but instead I found an understanding smile and what little expression one could devise from Talbots continuously ambiguous face.
“You know me, always up for a little fun.” Falco asserted, placing his gigantic hand on my shoulder. “I never liked the idea of my country being ruled by a guy wearing a cape anyway.” The two of us rested our gaze on the stoic figure of Talbot, the most rational out of the group.
“If the King ever found any one of the members, a fate worse than death would await them, you know that.” He stated seriously, his deep sincerity sucking the hope from the room like a vacuum. “But, I know how you plan things Puck, and this kid apparently knows his way around technology… Honestly, it’s probably not going to end well however, that’s what most people thought when Thomas Jefferson wrote the declaration of independence. So I say, why not? Let’s rattle the kings cage a bit, after all, what’s the point in living if you don’t take a stand once and a while? I’m in.”
That night was the beginning of the rest of my life and this is the story of how it ended.
That was a year ago today, and since then we’ve added a couple new faces to our little band of scoundrels (Amp had already put together a list of potential candidates before he broke into our condo that night, the kid is a worse insomniac than I am) and we now have over fifty cells operating independently across the north American territory.
Within six months my family had grown from just Talbot and Falco to six others of whom I would now die for in a heartbeat. Amp, who you know, is our computer brain, turns out he actually dropped out of MIT when he was arrested for hacking into the FBI mainframe (this was before he learned how to cover his tracks, as his constantly reminds us). Pinewood and Willow were the first recruited by Amp to join us, two sisters and former eco terrorists with a knack for environmentally friendly explosive devices. Baptist, a local ER doctor was brought into the fold when I got myself shot two months into Changeling. Mugs, a female cage fighter got herself arrested for speaking out against the king until Amp wiggled his way into the Boston PD’s computer system, saving her from five years in jail. Last but not least came Van Gogh, a local art professor at Harvard, we found when she was almost arrested for forging a famous Van Gogh painting, another clean up job exceptionally executed by Amp and his uncanny technical skills. In fact Mugs and Van Gogh are actually celebrating their year anniversary this week, who knew an illegal organization could breed such love?

Plot:
Hope, it’s a silly little thing. We’re told that as long as you have hope there is no such thing as defeat. We are surrounded by these fairy tales where “good” triumphs over “evil” and you are either for the heroes of the story or you are against them. In these fictions there are no shades of grey and no possibility of failure if you’re on the side of “good”. Wars will be fought and odds defied, no matter how extreme, for there is no way that darkness can stamp out the light. Or at least that’s what we were told when we were children, when the monsters in our closest were but figments of our imagination and hope filled our hearts. In reality, you can be as pure as a mountain stream and bleed just like the rest of us. You may think yourself a God, but death is the king of all.
It’s been seven years since the Battle of Manhattan, and as he promised, Loki brought humanity to their knees one nation at a time. Once the Avengers failed, there was little fight left in the hearts of the people. The UN attempted to hold back the flood but it was all for not, war stricken and broken, they submitted to his rule after five years of destruction and death. Loki, king of Midgard, now sits upon a throne built from the bones of his vanquished enemies, their sacrifice all but forgotten by the obedient. Children no longer know what it’s like to be able to claim freedom as a right and our elders no longer tell stories of liberty. We are no longer equal under the law, we are but slaves to our king, sheep resigned to heeding the command of our ruthless shepherd. Some of us however, turn out not to be that good at follow the leader.
A few reckless miscreants are stupid enough, crazy enough, idealistic enough, to have hope. We lurk in the shadows like common thieves, but our purpose is far more mischievous. We aren’t waging a war with rifles and tanks, we are playing tit for tat with the ultimate trickster. As a wise man once said, we aim to misbehave. We are the thorn in the kings side. We are vandals. We are rascals. We are criminals. We are the wayward sons and daughters of a forgotten liberty. We are Changeling and we are the rebellion.

Japan launched a new earthquake warning system in 2007.
It uses sensors that pick up the faster-moving and less destructive P-waves produced by an earthquake and transmits a warning broadcast on television and radio before the destructive S-waves and surface waves arrive, giving recipients of the message, precious seconds to seek shelter. (P waves are generally about 1.7 times faster than S waves)
The system gives people as much as a 50 second warning before an earthquake occurs in places far from the epicenter. The system is only really effective for places a decent distance away from epicenter.
Eight earthquake warnings were issued the first year the system was in operation. The main problem with them is that few people actually were aware of the warnings. Japanese companies have begun developing cell phones ad other devices that can pick up the warnings better. Japan also has a tsunami warning system that issues warnings on television.
Practical uses of the detection of P-waves
Shinkansen bullet trains
The Tohoku Shinkansen is a high-speed passenger train (bullet train) that connects Tokyo to the northern city of Morioka in Honshu, Japan.
The line is protected by a seismic early warning system, which includes two sets of accelerometers: one set is deployed along the line (wayside system), while the other comprises eight accelerometers placed along the eastern coast of Honshu (coastal system). The coastal system is designed to protect the train against earthquakes with origin in the highly active offshore subduction zone.
It causes trains to automatically stop when the ground acceleration exceeds a preset limit.
Earthquake prepared elevators
Otis, the elevator maker, had equipped a lot of their Japanese elevators with safety seismic equipment.
About half the elevators Otis maintains in Japan—including most in high-rise buildings and regions with severe earthquake risk—are equipped with seismic detectors. At the first vibration of the quake (P-wave), these devices return the elevators to the ground floor so passengers can exit, then block them until Otis can check their safety.
The detectors did their job. Some 16,700 elevators in the areas affected by the quake were shut down by the emergency systems. Otis, which had worldwide revenues of $11.58 billion in 2010 and manufactured about 40,000 of the 80,000 elevators it services in Japan, didn’t receive any report of trapped or injured passengers. “All the elevators operated as they were supposed to” said a company spokesperson.
Other uses
* Many factories in earthquake-prone areas have machines that automatically shut down when they sense vibrations from a quake.
* The Japanese gas company has installed meters that shut off the gas supply in the event of tremor.
* Nuclear power plants and other dangerous factories are also automatically shut down. (!?!?-ER)
Important remark : P-waves and S-waves arrive close together at places close to the epicenter, where warning would only be a matter of a couple seconds at most. As a result, such equipment will only be reliable with an epicenter at least 100 km (around 15-20 secs distance for P-waves, and around 30-40 secs for S-waves) from a populated area. Practically speaking it will be mainly used for subduction triggered earthquakes. Other countries able to use these systems are among others South American countries, Philippines, Indonesian, New Zealand etc. However, only 2 seconds is required to shut down essential facilities like power systems for hospitals and other services, so different systems are applicable if used for life safety versus life continuation. Therefore even at a much closer distance, early warning systems are extremely useful.
Something more about the speed of P-waves and S-waves
The speed of an earthquake wave is not constant but varies with many factors. Speed changes mostly with depth and rock type. P waves travel between 4 and 13 km/sec. S waves are slower and travel between 3.5 and 7.5 km/sec.
Generally spoken the destructive S-wave is approx. 50-60% of the velocity of the P-wave.
Make the calculation yourself with an average of 8 km/sec. and a distance from the epicenter of 240 km. The P-wave will then arrive 30 sec. after the rupturing. The destructive S-wave, traveling at 4.8 km/sec (60% of 8) will arrive after 50 seconds. The 20 seconds time lapse (in this example) is for a lot of instruments enough to safely stop.

Very interesting article. Is it possible to know more about the early warning system used in both of this cases, for the bullet trains and Otis?
Thank you.

Once I realized this I began to look for a direct and simple treatment to change my ph balance (acidity/alkalinity) back to a healthy range. Eventually I found the alkaline diet a ph balance diet that gave me pain relief leading to total symptom reversal. After I began treatment my recovery from arthritis was dramatic.
Some of these meals that it’s best to eat during the first phase include chicken beef fish turkey nuts eggs cheese and vegetables. If is also beneficial to eat garden salad with only 100% olive oil as a dressing. The food plan recommends that in this section it is best to consume three meals a day and fully cease consuming sugary foods or any other meals aside from the recommendations set out by the primary phase of the diet.

Sunday was so much fun!! I was inspired by my sister's story on NPR and decided to host a soup swap here where nearly 100 quarts of soup were on hand to be shared and traded. In a nutshell, a soup swap is when everyone makes a big pot of soup, freezes it into one quart portions, then meets up to tell stories and take turns selecting different soups to bring home. Knowing our freezers would soon be filled with yummy homemade soups, we also pulled some canned good out of our pantries and collectively filled three boxes which are being donated to a local food pantry.
I spent some time thinking about what I would bring to the party, and ultimately decided to make parsnip soup because it is a favorite of mine and the kids, and I like telling the story of the first time I tried it.
The story: Five years ago Jim and I escaped (without toddler Spencer) to Vegas for a few days in December. We were having dinner at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant in the Venetian, and shortly after we were seated, the table next to us received their food which included a bowl of delicious-looking soup. My mind was decided in that instant I wanted a bowl of soup too. I scanned the menu for their different soups, and noticed there was exactly one listed: parsnip soup. Parsnip soup? I had never had parsnip soup before. Actually, I had never even eaten parsnips before. I went back and forth in my head for a bit - really wanting a bowl of soup, and being wholly unsure of parnsips. Ultimately, I decided that this was a great restaurant and I trusted that they would be serving me a great bowl of (parsnip!) soup.
Guess what - the soup totally rocked! After returning home, I wanted to make it myself and couldn't find the recipe online. Luckily, the nice folks at wolfgangpuck.com replied to my email and sent it to me.
So, my hope is that making this soup for the swap and sharing this story might help someone else discover the awesomeness of parsnip soup!
Parnsip Soup
from Wolfgang Puck's Postrio Restaurant
INGREDIENTS:
3 Tbsp olive oil
2 medium yellow onions, peeled and rough diced (or one large onion)
2 stalks celery, cut to 1” lengths
6 cups parsnips, peeled and cut to 1” cubes (will be rough)
1 ea potato, peeled and cut into four quarters
1 ½ ea granny smith apples, peeled and diced to 1” (rough)
8-12 cups chicken stock
1 ½ cups heavy cream
12 sprigs fresh thyme, tied together tightly with string
2 tsp lemon juice
salt
white pepper
DIRECTIONS:
- In a medium sized soup pot, heat the olive oil. Add the onion, season well with salt, and sweat on medium heat until translucent (about 5 minutes). Do not brown the onion. Add the celery and cook for 3 more minutes.
- In a separate pot, bring the chicken stock to a boil and reduce heat to just a high simmer.
- Add the parsnips to the onions and stir well. Continue to cook for two minutes. Add enough hot chicken stock to cover the vegetables. Add the potato, apples, and thyme.
- Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a low boil, and cook uncovered until vegetables are very soft, about 50 minutes. You may need to add stock during the cooking time, but do so just that the vegetables are covered. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
- Add the cream and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the thyme. Puree the soup in batches in a blender. ALWAYS BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN PUREEING HOT LIQUIDS. Use the lid on the blender. When pureeing, fill the blender cup only 2/3 full, as the soup will be thick and you will need room to add more stock. If the soup is very thick in the blender, turn it off, add a little hot stock, cover and puree.
- Position a strainer over a clean soup pot and pour directly from the blender into the strainer. Push the soup through the strainer with a ladle.
- Place soup back over very low heat on the stove. Adjust consistency of the soup with chicken stock. Add the lemon juice and season finally to taste with salt and pepper. The soup is ready to serve, or can be chilled in an icebath and kept for up to 3 days.
- Serve soup in warm bowls. Drizzle lightly with lemon thyme oil, and sprinkle with thyme leaves.
Lemon-Thyme Oil
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
zest of half a lemon
12 sprigs fresh thyme
- Combine ingredients in a small saucepan. Heat to just hot to the touch (DO NOT BOIL), remove from heat and allow to steep for 1 hour. Strain and reserve oil. Allow to cool completely before serving.

Our chosen combination of ingredients and the methods they apply to create what they believe is a good risotto.
This time Chef James Schiavone from Tartarun Restaurant in Marsaxlokk, chose the Carnaroli rice variety to prepare his mare e monti risotto, apparently a much applauded item on his specials menu. The marriage of ingredients from the earth with those from the sea give birth to this delicate and rich risotto.
Ingredients for 4 people:
- 320g Carnaroli rice
- 2 cloves garlic
- 4 shallots
- Approx. 800ml prawn stock
- 150g portobello mushrooms
- 8 slices speck
- 160g peeled prawns
- 120g Parmesan cheese, grated
- 60g buttter
- Truffle oil
- Red chard leaves, to decorate (optional)
Prawn stock
- 800g prawn shells
- 100g Carrots, finely chopped
- 100g Onions, finely chopped
- 80g Celery, finely chopped
- 80g Fennel, finely chopped
- 20g Garlic, crushed
- 40g Tomato paste
- 200ml White wine
- 2 ltr Water
- 500ml Tomato juice
- Bouquet garni
- Pepper corns
To prepare the prawn stock:
- Sweat the prawn shells in olive oil until golden. Remove shells and drain the fat.
- In the same pan sweat the celery, onion, fennel and carrots in some olive oil and butter. Add the garlic and sweat for about 5 mins, add the tomato paste. Cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, add the white wine and reduce by half.
- Add the shells, bouquet garni, water, and tomato juice, bring to boil and skim any fat from surface.
- Simmer for 45 minutes. When ready pass well through a fine sieve.
- Place the stock back on the stove on low heat, and skim the remaining impurities, taste and season with salt, sugar and fresh lemon juice. Keep boiling for the risotto.
Risotto Mare e Monti
To prepare the risotto:
- In a thick bottom pan, pour a few tablespoons of cooking oil. Add the rice, lightly toast. After a minute add 700 ml of boiling stock at once. Mix gently and simmer on low heat for approximately 13 minutes.
- In a separate pan pour some oil, when the pan is hot add the garlic and shallots, toss occasionally, add the Portobello mushrooms, until lightly brown. Add the prawns and sauté.
- When the rice is ready. Add the butter and Parmesan. Add ½ a ladle of stock to make it as runny as you like. Stir well. Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes. This stage is very important when making a good risotto. Taste and season. The risotto should be creamy.
- Fold in the prawns and mushrooms mixture and plate.
- Garnish with the speck a drizzle of truffle oil and leaves of red chard.

Abstract:
Wood biomass in Serbia is traditionally used for energy. However, the manner of its use is outdated, and efficiency is very low. Annually over 3.5millionm3 of wood is cut down for energy needs in Serbia. In order to better exploit all forms of woody biomass, especially the one that is now treated as waste, and in order to fulfil the obligations from the outlined Convention on Climate Change it is necessary to switch to a modern way of production and utilization of woody biomass. Serbia is now at the very beginning of this process. This paper gives an overview and an analysis of the possibilities of utilization of wood waste as a renewable source of energy and the problems that producers in Serbia are facing due to undeveloped markets and excessive funds that are needed to start the production of briquettes and pellets. The ecological and economical advantages of using woody biomass, as well the possible support measures for the use of woody biomass in Serbia are also the topic of this paper. The present situation in this area, the manner of waste management in sawmills and the reasons for the necessity of future development of this industrial production are also briefly described.

Even.
Twitter founder Biz Stone is on record as stating that looking for a business model might be a "distraction" for his company, but in an economic environment where the future is uncertain and suddenly-cautious investors have rediscovered the importance of revenue, this attitude could eventually prove to be very problematic for obvious reasons.
Last week, Bernard Lund of ReadWriteWeb called on his readers to "Help Twitter Find a Revenue Model." After all, he noted:
"Twitter won't survive if it doesn't find a great revenue model."
I read Lund's post with interest and followed the responses with interest. I've decided to address the issue here because I think Twitter actually makes for an interesting case study that can benefit many internet entrepreneurs.
Let's go through some of the more common suggestions for Twitter's business model and then let's take a look at what we can learn from the way Twitter has approached developing one.
Advertising
Is there money in advertising for Twitter? Sure. The question is - how much? In my estimation, it's probably not enough to sustain the type of business that Twitter is and the type of business its investors hope it will become.
As we have seen with Facebook and MySpace, one of the great challenges in monetizing "social media" properties is that the users are far too busy "socializing" to pay attention to advertising.
I don't think Twitter is different from Facebook and MySpace in this respect, and given Twitter's tech-savvy audience, I suspect that the problem of advertising blindness will be an even bigger factor with Twitter.
Some tout more "innovative" advertising models that emphasize "user engagement" as a solution to Twitter's monetization troubles but I'm skeptical.
After all, nobody has truly convinced brands that they've discovered a way to turn "user engagement" into ROI. Further, brands that want to leverage Twitter as an engagement tool can do so by simply setting up a free account.
While it's conceivable that Twitter could offer special features with a "brand account" (much like Facebook and MySpace charge brands for "pages"), whether or not this can be turned into a significant business is questionable in my opinion.
Given inevitable cuts to advertising budgets in any economy like this, I think that an advertising business model, no matter how "innovative," is not going to be a panacea for Twitter. It could be a part of a business model but it isn't a complete business model in and of itself.
Data mining and brand monitoring
A lot of people believe that Twitter is in a perfect position to collect data and mine it for the benefit of brands. Is it?
The market for brand monitoring services is growing but but data mining is a complicated business and turning large amounts of raw data into large amounts of valuable, actionable analysis is a huge challenge.
While there's no doubt that Twitter collects a lot of "data," I question whether Twitter has enough of true value to be of real use to brands.
Quite honestly, I doubt that Twitter's data is going to be of a sample size that is meaningful to major brands. Most people who argue for data mining services on consumer internet properties really don't understand the scale at which major brands operate and what is truly of value to them.
Knowing that 500 people on Twitter are criticizing you or that 5000 tweets have mentioned your newest product is probably of very little use to most major brands.
As such, I think it's unlikely that Twitter is going to develop an attractive business as a data miner and overestimating the potential for data mining would be a genuine "distraction" for Twitter.
Licensing/platform
Some have suggested that there's a demand within organizations for Twitter-like tools and that Twitter should license its platform. Others have suggested that Twitter's platform could become the backbone for a microblogging infrastructure that Twitter could charge for access to.
The challenge with the various licensing/platform revenue models that have been floated is that the Twitter platform itself is hardly defensible. A Twitter clone won TechCrunch50 and there is a decent open-source alternative in Laconica.
And while Twitter seems to have improved on its reliability, given all the problems experienced, I'd argue that the most serious individuals and companies would think twice before trusting Twitter at this stage of the game. Even one of Twitter's investors recently asked, "Will recent reliability success continue? Can Twitter's architecture scale now?"
At the end of the day, I believe a licensing/platform business model is incompatible with Twitter's direction at the current time and that trying to make this work would be risky.
Paid services
As much as I found no value in my little experiment with Twitter, the bottom line is that many of Twitter's users find it hard to live without. And some have stated that they'd be willing to pay to help the company thrive.
I'm a big fan of online premium service businesses because there's usually no business model more elegant (and simple) than selling a product or service that people want. In fact, as I have pointed out, these types of businesses (in theory) usually have a much better correlation between costs and revenues.
Given the anecdotal evidence that many of Twitter's most passionate users are willing to pay for the service, I see no reason for Twitter to shun such a revenue model.
Of course, given that Twitter already offers its service free of charge, it's not going to be able to successfully implement a model that is 100% paid. It will need to adopt a freemium model in which some of its features remain free and more advanced features (existing or new) are available to only those who pay.
Getting the mix right so that paying users can subsidize the non-paying ones while still making a profit can often be tricky but it's not impossible, especially when ancillary revenue streams like advertising contribute to the bottom line in some fashion.
The big problem for Twitter is that its refusal to charge for anything has already provided opportunity for other businesses that have been built around the Twitter "ecosystem." Twitterific, a MAC Twitter client, for instance is sold for $14.95. And when Twitter cut off SMS support in some countries outside of the United States, nimble entrepreneurs came in to fill the void.
That said, I do believe that paid services represent the best opportunity for Twitter to turn its user growth into revenue growth. Whether or not it can generate enough revenue from paid services to live up to the expectations investors who have invested in it at exorbitant valuations is unknown.
What can we learn?
So what does Twitter's business model dilemma teach us? Two things in particular:
- Finding a scalable business model isn't always easy. Oftentimes, business models that are in vogue aren't as viable as many would like to believe.
- It's important to look at a business model as soon as possible. The longer you go without one, the greater the risk that your options will "decay" in some form or another.
In all of this, it's worth considering that Twitter is a unique case. Most entrepreneurs start businesses to make money (not to build something "cool") and most entrepreneurs don't have the luxury of getting tens of millions from investors who are content to wait on a business model.
Twitter's investors have been content to wait and in the process, Twitter has already forfeited a number of potentially important revenue streams. While it may not be impossible for Twitter to recapture them in some fashion (and to create new ones), it has made its job more difficult and that's never a good thing for a startup business that is reliant on investors to keep the lights (and servers) on.
The reality is that we have seen no shortage of consumer internet startups (many without outside funding) over the past several years that either overestimated the ease with which a business model could be developed and executed or that put off the development of a business model for a rainy day.
Now that the rainy day is here, it's going to be very interesting to watch well-capitalized startups like Twitter try to make the transition from cool to cashflow positive.
In the United States, the phrase "Drill, baby, drill" recently became popularized by one of the presidential campaigns. Hopefully here in internet land we'll hear more chants of "Charge, baby, charge." Maybe Twitter can lead the way.

something simple they could do to make a bit of money is include ads in their 'single tweet' pages. every tweet is given its own page right now. here's an example:
regular users never ever look at these pages, but there are millions of them ranking in search for weird & wonderful terms.
it feels a bit spammy (like the agoga.com anysearchterm.cm thing), but sticking ads into those pages (adsense, contextual display ads, etc) would show them to the searching masses, while avoiding annoying regular twitterers.

The issue of revenue generation is likely to remain a problem for social platforms for a while to come. In my opinion, the most viable solution for micro blogging sites such as Twitter stems from the possibilities afforded by the add on services that result. Either Twitter could license their data to the third party developers that use the information to provide a service, or Twitter could create its own applications offered under a premium account.

I am a big Twitter users but I struggle to see what could be paid for. Advertising is declining in popularity as a valid model to pay for social media, due to poor results elsewhere and marketing cutbacks. There could be money in data mining, but this is really just Social Media Monitoring and anyone paying for this would want to be able to do it across all social media, not just Twitter.
I have long thought subscription is the best route forward for social media/networking companies: if they are offering something valuable then people will pay. The problem there for Twitter is that in spite of it being free it has only got 3 million of so users, few of which are hardcore. Adding a fee isn't going to make it ubiquitous.
I actually like Twitter and a lot of the principle of micro-blogging, like we also now see on LinkedIn and Facebook with their status updates, we incorporated into WeCanDo.BIZ. But on our site, we use it to connect people with business needs to other members who can supply a solution. It's a sales leads system and 30% of our users exploit it, even though many won't know of Twitter. Further, they've indicated they'd pay for it too.
Twitter is a neat concept -- it just needs to find its home.

Really interesting points to note down...
However I think, as author has pointed out- an "user engagement" model like squidoo.com will benifit Twitter to grow more over time, whilst engaging some contextual ads.

Twitter must come up with ways how to make money enough not only to survive but to keep its site for a long long time. A lot of businesses are generating revenues using Twitter, so it is just fair for Twitter to have a cut. I admit, there are tons of micro-businesses benefiting from Twitter, but if you add them all up, it will be huge money for twitter.

Interesting points. I wouldn't be surprised if Twitter will come up with more ways they can generate income to secure their business. If they do so, I would like those big companies benefiting from using the twitter to have the bigger share of Twitter's income.

Changes.
I have not been posting much lately, mainly because I’ve been going through a lot of life changes and major events in a very short span of time. I defended my thesis, started a new job, and I’m in the …

Capt. Ed Burns provides Tall Ships
Commentary for
from fixed, waterfront locations
or while aboard chartered yachts cruising among the Tall Ships.
Capt. Ed is the most experienced English-speaking
commentator on tall ships available today. He has
been professionally engaged in this unique line of work for each of the United
States visits of the Tall Ships since 1976.
His good-natured wit and wisdom add charm and humor
and an almost scholarly appreciation for the subject, leaving your audience
both well-informed and entertained.
If you are responsible for arranging either a port
visit or corporate entertainment relating to a visit of the Tall Ships, you
must consider how your event/party will be announced. Often, owners of
chartered yachts direct their captains to narrate at no additional cost to the
customer and no additional compensation for the captain. The narration is free,
and it's worth every penny. Sometimes a port visit organizer can get a local
radio or television personality to fill in, in which case you may end up with a
well-known landlubber regurgitating fluff and filler for hours on end. There's
a world of difference between a pretty face ad-libbing something he or she
doesn't really know very much about and having an experienced professional with
a proven track record work your event. If the outcome makes a difference,
you'll have to put some real effort into the preparations. Hire a professional.
Among those who know, Capt. Ed Burns is one of The Best.

A to get this done. Its also made me realise the value editors can bring to the publication process.
I’ll eventually get the pre-print into a repository and you can view the original report upon which it was based on the Arcadia website.
Software Selection Methodology for Libraries
I’ve contributed to a software selection methodology of libraries, put together by the forward thinking folk at Cottage Labs for Lyrasis for their Open Source Software in libraries site. Its pretty general but contains a few nuggets learned from several implementation and selection projects.
Talks
I’ll be speaking speaking at DCMI seminar on Linked Data held at the British Library next week. Looks to be a great event. It will be a report back on the COMET project, hopefully timely given OCLC’s recent vote on ODC-By Licensing for WorldCat data. There have been some reservations regarding this, especially around attribution stacking. This was the the main problem we faced in Comet but attribution can work if handed correctly (i.e. better than we’ve done so far with Marc21). Its’ a niche used license compared to CC0 or PDDL but is a really welcome move forward from OCLC. Apparently their WorldCat API sees 15 million hits a month! Thats usage that many open data suppliers could only dream of.
Code
Speaking of Comet, the code base for the whole project is now on the glorious Github, which I am slowly waking up to. I’ve also added source for a barebones interface to consumer the SALT library recommender API. I’ll make a conscious effort to get over coder shyness and get more work up on there where feasible.
Ed &nsah; I missed that you’ve had your first formal article published. Congrats!

When I first graduated college, I took a job as a staff newspaper photographer. The hours were variable and 12 hour days were not unusual. During this time period, it was often too dark for me to enjoy my patio garden by the time I got home. Until I discovered the concept of a night garden.
Although it sounds like a night garden should involve weeding with a miner’s headlamp on my head, a night garden is actually a garden design that incorporates plants that are night blooming or highly visible at dusk or by a porch light.
The Victorians called this type of garden a moon garden. The moon garden was a favorite of Victorian ladies who wanted to enjoy the outdoors without spoiling their complexions.
Good plants for night gardens include variegated plants with white stripes, white flowers such as roses or silver foliage such as lamb’s ear, plants with strong perfumes such as honeysuckle and jasmine, and night blooming plants such as moon flower or late evening blooming plants such as four o’clocks.
Here are some plants that are suitable for a night garden:
Flowering Tobacco (Nicotiana alata) – A member of the Nightshade family with long, tubular blossoms. Modern hybrids do not have strong jasmine fragerance like the heirloom version.
Evening Primrose – These night-blooming flowers have four heart shaped leaves that form a tiny cup. Long, frilly stames poke out of each blossom. These flowers bloom white and fade to pink. Evening primrose have a scent reminiscent of honeysuckle.
August Lily – a hosta variety with a honey scent. August lily have leaves that are deeply veined and reach six inches long and four inches wide. The plants produce white flowers on tall stalks.
Carolina Jasmine – this plant has evergreen leaves and yellow, bell- shaped flowers. Although the plant blossoms during the day, it produces stronger perfume at night.
Moon Frolic Daylilly – despite being a day lilly, moon frolic produces creamy white blossoms that bloom at night. According to Clemson State University, there are 49 other varieties of night blooming daylilly including Toltec Sundial, Witches Dance and Jewel of Hearts.
There are many other great night blooming plants that you can use exclusively Or in combination with day blooming plants. Check with your local garden center for varieties that they may carry.
There is such a thing as planting by the moon also. I didn’t know about the Victorian ladies, interesting. I had Evening Primrose for several years in the garden, but they have disappeared this year.

She Say: Monogamy
The other said, “Love is cursed by monogamy.” –Kanye West
My homegirl’s second boyfriend has a wife and his wife has a girlfriend and everyone is cool with that.
If that just confused you, it should. They’re practicing polyamory: practice, desire, or acceptance of having more than one intimate relationship at a time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved (Wikipedia). Although polyamory is no new phenomenon, it is something that’s becoming quite prevalent amongst African-American couples. But wait; let’s not confuse polyamory with polygamy (multiple marriage), poly sexuality (attraction to multiple genders and/or sexes), and open relationships (get-it-popping-with-whom-you-like-and-then-come-home-to-me).
The list goes on.
In the land of poly-everything and sexual freedom, I know one thing is absolutely certain. I ain’t with it.
Issue number one, I’m selfish. I pushed kids off swings as a child, for my ascending breeze and glory. Number two; I don’t trust too many people. I’m not giving my body to anyone who’s involved with other folks that I’m not fully educated on. STD’s are real. Three, I’m a Christian. I am absolutely sure Eve only had one husband.
However, I’m not here to lecture with religion. I’m here to defend my belief in monogamy.
I heard somewhere that love is finding the counterpart of your soul in another human being. I believe this. The man that I’m head over heels in love with is my counterpart. His idiosyncrasies supplement my own, creating an everlasting equilibrium.
When I’m loud and abrasive, his subtle demeanor calms my own; bring my roar to a lull. When I’m annoyed and ready to go, his patience always finds resolution.
When my mood sours and dances with melancholy, his awkward humor invigorates my spirit.
It is difficult to single out idiosyncrasies. The little peculiar flaws we try to hide, sit and wait under our tongues and fingernails; waiting for a way out. Time and longevity are an idiosyncrasy’s weakness.
I’m not talking about characteristics. The general things don’t really matter when it comes to relationships. His perfect smile or silent tone will not thrust you to the boundary of staying or going.
It’s the little things that will keep you in limbo. It’s the way his fingers tap against tables when he’s nervous. It will be the way his lips seem to curve upward, as if he’s smiling when you’re kissing. It’s the sound he makes, right before dawn breaks, and he realizes that he’s still by your side.
Only monogamy can whisper you these things.
It will whisper loneliness when his space in the bed is bereft of his dent. It will tell you precisely what he’s doing, even when your eyes are turned. It will allow for even the most nails-scratching-chalkboard of flaws to camouflage into your everyday environment.
It will tell you precisely what you’re getting into.
For the women/men who are willing to share, I commend you. It is a brave and dangerous task to split yourselves in places you spout emotion and toil.
To answer a question I’ve heard one too many horrendous times, “Who practices monogamy anymore?”
I do.
I am one who believes in the power of reaffirming. I believe in the power of unrequited love: A solace that swoons over you and burns bright every time you’re in your significant other’s presence. You will beam, knowing your solidity is founded within the bond between JUST you two.
You’ll take pride in knowing that you are no one’s halve, but that you are whole.

Iowa Department of Education Director Jason Glass and other department leaders submitted an application for a waiver from the rigid accountability measures of the federal No Child Left Behind law. The proposal reflects a bold accountability system that makes sense for Iowa and emphasizes student growth and progress in addition to proficiency on tests, Glass said.
Iowa's Waiver Request
Iowa's Waiver Request Attachments
Iowa's Waiver Request Appendices
NCLB Waiver Request Legislative Briefing
While No Child Left Behind has advanced some important reforms, such as shifting attention to the nation's neediest students, the law also holds schools to unrealistic measures and then labels those that fall short as failing.
"Today marks an opportunity for Iowa's schools – an opportunity for this era of blame and shame to come to an end," Glass said. "This new accountability system will be central to our work to transform Iowa's good schools into world-class schools."
President Obama and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan last August invited states to apply for a waiver from the No Child Left Behind law in exchange for rigorous and comprehensive state-developed accountability plans. States must meet three principles in their waiver applications: Adopt college- and career-ready standards for all students; redesign the accountability system to fairly identify successes and target supports to schools that are struggling; and improve evaluation and support systems for teachers and administrators.
Elements of education legislation introduced by Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds in January set the stage for a successful waiver request. The legislation builds on the work of establishing state standards through the Iowa Core; redesigns Iowa's system of assessments so they tightly align with the Iowa Core and emphasize applying knowledge to complex problems; includes a college-entrance exam for all 11th graders and a career-readiness assessment for students who opt for one; uses a sophisticated student growth measure that takes into account student backgrounds and demographics; and improves teacher and principal evaluations to deliver timely and individualized feedback.
Over the past two months, Department leaders have worked to share information and gather input statewide from education stakeholder groups, educators, state policymakers and community leaders, and parents and students. Communication efforts will continue as Iowa moves forward with its waiver proposal.
The Department is joined by the School Administrators of Iowa, the Iowa Association of School Boards and the Urban Education Network of Iowa in the commitment to bring state education policies in line with the waiver proposal – a critical component needed to make Iowa's application successful.
Glass said he will withdraw the waiver application if there is little or no movement in this area at the State Capitol this session.
"Neither the status-quo policy framework, nor an overly watered-down version of education reform, will meet what has been written into Iowa's waiver," Glass said.
Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia have indicated they will apply for waivers by the second-round deadline, which is today.
Eleven states that applied in the first round in November were approved.
Glass said he expects to receive feedback from the U.S. Department of Education and to make any necessary revisions in the spring.
An overview of federal guidance and information about the waiver process can be found at.

Glass said. “This work is about making a difference for Iowa’s students and educators by transforming the teaching profession. We must develop a structure that keeps teachers connected to their craft, creates pathways so that the most effective educators can work with their fellow teachers, and stems the tide of teachers leaving the profession. Right now, there aren’t a lot of ways to move up, so many talented teachers go into administration or leave education completely.”
Glass said recommendations to raise starting salaries, create a residency year for new teachers and provide opportunities for advancement will make the teaching profession more attractive to the best and brightest young people.
The task force’s recommendations are as follows:
- Create and fund multiple, meaningful and well-designed career pathway opportunities open to all teachers in Iowa.
- Establish a pathway that utilizes the wisdom and expertise of educators who are not currently practicing, including retired teachers.
- Review existing allocations and use these funds strategically to enhance teacher compensation and create leadership opportunities.
- Appropriate new money for the explicit purposes of raising base pay to a competitive level and creating additional leadership opportunities for teachers.
- Establish a Commission on Educator Leadership and Compensation to ensure consistent and successful implementation.
- Collaborate with districts implementing a mechanism for piloting peer assistance and coaching programs.
- Incentivize teachers to teach in locally and state-defined hard-to-staff subjects and high-need schools.
- Build upon existing policy and statute, and provide adequate, sustained funding and implementation support for teacher leadership.
- Set the boundaries of the system, but allow districts to customize.
- Provide time for local planning and implementation inclusive of teachers in the decision-making process.
- Require districts to implement professional development structures aligned with the Iowa Professional Development Model that support each career pathway, and utilize teacher leaders to ensure continuous collaboration on student growth.
- Coordinate the development of teacher leadership pathways with teacher preparation programs.
- Create a residency year for entry into the teaching profession to build a more seamless transition from teacher preparation to practice/employment.
Glass established the Task Force on Teacher Leadership and Compensation in February to help the state move forward strategically in the areas of teacher leadership roles and compensation issues. It is a component of the education reform recommendations introduced by Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds last January, as well as one of six state task forces created as part of Senate File 2284, the education package adopted by the Iowa Legislature this spring.

Re; the statement (in Cover boy-1 comments)describing Egyptian’s street reactions following Nasser’s speeches and during his funeral as being whole hearted and less due to government nudging speaks badly about Egyptian preparedness to espouse democratic principles of governing. That statement implies if hypothetically, there was a clean election (not like the ones with 99.9%) he would still have won. I can only imagine this may to be true during the period of Suez Canal nationalization, post 1956 war, and up to 1962 when most positive glorious news (real or fictions) surrounded him, that I have no quarrel with. From 1962 onward there were a lot of questions about the wisdom of unity with Syria and the Yemen war, followed shortly by the disaster of 1967 and his famous reaction of “I didn’t know”. If honestly, Egyptian still worshipped him after that fiasco, added to the fact that after 9 years nationalization of business in Egypt didn’t deliver any of the claimed social promises (meaning that their day to day lives essentials re; food, transportation, and accommodations were rapidly going downward), this means that they cannot distinguish truth from fictions. Responding to glorious words and political promises is one thing, assessing and accommodating factual, unimaginable military venture and defeat, and military corruption, is another. I don’t know how we expect them to criticize Mubarak(s) (Hosni or Gamal), and even have hope for something close to democracy.
honestly after watching the King Farouk series, I have no respect at all for all the revolutionary officers coz they are bunch of thieves and traitors to the King and Egypt. They accused the King of corruption, thief, womanizer but King Farouk was not a man as mentioned above in fact he was a decent man who loves Egypt more that any of these revolution officers. He left the country without taking anything which belongs to him. The revolution officers are the one who are bunch of thieves and robbed egypt and egyptians people of their money. Egypt would have been better if there is no revolution! Allah swt have punished a few of them and soon others too!
If Gamal Abdel Nasser was a good President and one of the revolution officer and being the first to rule after the King left (not mentioning President Naguib coz he was President for a short time before Nasser put him under house arrest!) where is all the treasures belong to the Late King Farouk and his families until now and why it is never being openly shown to public?
Why is that we have a lot of revolution officers having stolen treasures belong to the late King Farouk and now the treasure are kept by bank in England thru auction? What did Nasser bring to Egypt except shameful war loses and collapse of Egypt economy! Sadat didnt manage to rule long either coz he was killed but he was a good President and he took Sinai back from the Israel and the world respect Egypt. The current President didnt do anything for Egypt either. No development for the last 26 years. Israel managed to build a country with the money from US within a short period only! With all the money aide came from US and money came thru the Suez Canal, Egypt should have been a rich country already so long!!!
@Anonymous , you did not see my Arabic it is even worse
@Frank , welcome to my blog , Nasser was popular as international threat , wait till you see the Sadat era
@Ohio , look dear I do not deny that the Socialist Union used to organize protests from the school kids and factories workers but you can't deny that the man had one hell of a charming personality , do not speak about the Egyptian people what about the Arabic people , first of all People in Egypt began to wake up in 1967 but not earlier because the country was under huge control of censorship ,about the achievements of the revolution let's be realistic , first of all we have had till 3 president "Naguib time unfortunately can't be counted" each one of them is different from the other and each of them did not apply any or all of the revolution 6 golden promises , still each of them had a chance to make a change , you know I am sick of the Shama3 of the revolution , Mubarak had 25 years and he is certainty was the first to be from the generation beyond the revolution , he could have made huge changes more than Nasser more than Sadat I do not defend the revolution here by the way.
@Anonoymous , so President Sadat was a traitor and President Nasser was a traitor and President Naguib who was better than all of them and than Farouk himself was a traitor!!?? treason charges are too big to be thrown when you just made your judgement after watching TV series written by Human beings
Look my point history is not read like simply by watching a A TV series , I did not reach to my conclusion that the 23rd July coup was not as successful as it was said to be from reading books and articles from different sources ,countries and years
about Mubarak and 25 years , well please read my above comment
history is not black or white

November 9th, 2011
So me and my ex-girlfriend have been separated for a few months now and I just can't seem to move. Its safe to say I got way to attach to her. I miss her so much. I thought time would make a difference but I feel the same way just as if she had left yesterday. We went through a lot and I just can't figure why it was so easy for her to just walk away. I remember when we first met she was so into me and in the end she broke up with me via her cellphone. i felt so betrayed and abandon. Its funny b/c when I wasn't that into her she was in love with me but it seems when i started getting real feelings for her she kind of got scare. I told her i loved her and she told me I needed to be with someone who wanted to be with me as much as I wanted to be with them...She was the first and only person I ever loved so naturally when she decided to break with me I acted a bit stupid...i said a lot of bad things about her and her mom( i know it was wrong to do so but in the state that i was in i had no control over my emotions and just let everything out and that gave her a real reason to never talk to me). I have tried contacting her serve times to apologize but she won't have anything to do me...i asked her serve times if we could just be friends but i have yet to get any kind of feedback from her at all...The more i try contacting her and the fact that she doesn't make an effort to have communication with me just makes me feel like "crap" ..I try not to think about her but the more i do that the more i end up thinking about her...her face is burnt into memories...that said i have found it to be hard to concentrate on my school work...i lost a lot of weight and gained a few bad habits...I find that smoking makes me not think about her as much but thats only a temp fix b/c i can't smoke all the time lol...i feel very depressed .. i tried talking to my friends and they all say i should try to meet someone else but I'm still a bit shaken up and I'm really have confidence issues about myself...i need to move on but don't know how...I even tried praying to god but i haven't seen any results from that(my moms advice)...i have this empty feeling inside of me that i can't get rid of and it makes it really hard for me to do my daily activities...but u guys know what makes me really depress is the fact that i know that she doesn't miss me at all and all she has been doing is partying..we almost had a baby together but decided to get an abortion b/c we were to young but that was a mistake that i will regret for the rest of my life..i miss my baby so much.. i would do anything just to hear her voice again but i can't afford to make myself vulnerable again just to be ignored like a complete and total stranger..i don't think i could handle that again so i erased her number from my phone, deleted her pictures and videos too...but I'm still holding onto some of the voicemails she left me..sad isn't it? I sick of feeling worthless just bc a girl doesn't want to be with me anymore but its not that easy....i had no idea falling in love with her would be the biggest mistakes of my life... i need help guys

Love, Love, Love
Dude,thats the bad thing about falling in love.Its easy to fall in love but getting over it can be very difficult if you still have feelings for her. Love is great, it motivates you, it makes you wanna do everything all at once! but one day its over. Logically yes because we die. We all die alone. But in terms of relationships, therere lots of them that last a lifetime but others are doomed. You my friend,I know its hard, I know how you feel (its relative ok ) but youre going through a phase in which you have to suffer. I know its been a long time and you seem not getting over her but thats normal if you persist having the feelings around. You dont have to hate her, some think its easier but you have to organize your life, its pushing you down and you dont deserve that, youre a good guy and you need to like yourself a little more. She doesnt like you but you need to like yourself to more to move on. And if you like yourself stop what youre doing. I know , "its easy for to say that because youre not in my position!" but you know that there arent many ways to solve this. Even if you dont wanna hear this now, you will meet other woman in your life and this experience you had with your ex made good to you because now you more about how relationships work. What went wrong with your ex now you can prevent with in a future relationships. Its sucks suffering, its depressing but its also a lesson. you learn a lot ! I know you thought a lot about what went wrong and all that, and oh if i did things this way etc etc.. My friend organize yourself, your priorities. dont say no to love but dont go running after it. Life has a lot to offer, not just love and sex. ( although its fu***** great) everything in its time. I feel alone, i hate it. but im gonna do what i just recommended you. And youll do the same. ok? Friends are important, you surely have friends. go out with them, never talk about her. its boring, and when you meet a girl, talk to her with respect. Dont make a movie about it. Thers still a lot to learn. Love is understanding. Sorry for my english, im portuguese. Bye

Live your life, get out there, have some fun

Gerber Survival Knives – Prime Quality And Awesome Geber Survival Knives With Straightforward To Create Utilization Of
This knife is quite parallel phrases] of tang for your Gerber Infantry; stated, this knife contains a flint! The sheath is purely] not as cumbersome both. I am certain Bear Grylls will appear out with an extra, but I fully appreciate this knife.
suitable right here my assessment for useing this gerber survival knives with the 50 a long time
This can be an incredible, multi-useful knife. Multi-purpose is essential within a survival instrument.
The blade can come shaving sharp. Correct out from the field I was capable to really simply shave a segment of hair from my forearm. The serated area in the knife can additionally be effectively made. Total tang blade as well, which is truly a have to in my e book for a fixed blade knife.
The added functions of your blade are incredibly good and functional. The flint stick lcks into the sheath very securely.
The sheath is excellent, specially wherever the blade basically slides into and houses the blade and flint stick. This piece is manufactured from tough, heavy-responsibility plastic. The whistle is good, not incredibly loud however really audible.
The general dimensions in the blade would seem great for me. It is really not too massive to get unweildy, and its not too smaller to not sense confident. It has an excellent nicely balanced fat and really feel in my hand. The rubberized take care of is fantastic, and feels comfortable using a sound grip. The hammer inside the pommel is heavy responsibility and attributes identical checkered texture as some actual hammers.
All round it is an awesome nife. The price might seem to be higher, however this appears for being an excellent quality knife blade with some incredibly strong and helpful additional characteristics. I’m glad. It is not so expensive that you may be afraid to implement it. This can be a blade meant to generally be utilised.
Would like to do just a little discipline testing around the knife and blade to determine how it holds up. But general am really glad and will look forward for what additional goods Bear and Gerber roll out in his survival series.

Six school buses crash into each other in Georgia
Six school buses taking some 200 middle school students to Six Flags crashed…in Newton County, Ga., leaving more than 50 people injured…
There were a total of around 200 students from Burke County Middle School in Waynesboro, Ga., on the six buses……Morgan County sent several buses to the scene to help transport uninjured children…No report of any of them running into each other.
The Georgia State Patrol’s Specialized Collision Reconstruction Team is investigating the accident, according to Wright.
And that should take a chunk of their annual budget.
The humor helps. It doesn’t make life any easier for the kids who were hurt – or the bus driver airlifted to hospital. But, the active ingredient in this crash, like all chain collisions, is carelessness – following too close.
It’s called Human Error.
NAACP endorses same-sex marriage
Benjamin Todd Jealous, NAACP President
Daylife/Reuters Pictures used by permission
…
Pew Research Center polls have found that African Americans have become more supportive of same-sex marriage in recent years, but remain less supportive than other groups…
My thought? Overdue.
The NAACP is about as old-line a political organization there could be in the Black community. The organization’s history has varied with the times. That does not diminish its importance or the role played by individuals, chapters and the whole body.
This is an important step in furthering the civil rights of all Americans. Something the NAACP knows a lot more about than the average follower of the Kool Aid Party and today’s Republicans.
Diabetic and his service dog kicked out of Popeyes’ restaurant
Taylor Gipson’s service dog – Bear
For nearly two years, a four-legged friend has followed 20-year-old Taylor Gipson of north Fulton County everywhere he goes. Whether he’s in classes at Kennesaw State University or at a restaurant with his family, Gipson’s British lab, Bear, is also there…
Because of his Type 1 diabetes, Gipson’s blood sugar levels can rise or drop quickly, and as a teenager, he had seizures during the night. His service dog is trained to alert him when his blood sugar is dropping or rising, Gipson says. And Bear sometimes is an even better indicator than his owner’s blood sugar meter…
Because Bear is a trained service dog, he is allowed to accompany Gipson just about everywhere he goes, according to the Americans with Disabilities Act. Gipson didn’t think twice about taking Bear into a Popeyes restaurant on Windy Hill Road last Saturday.
“I was having a low blood sugar, so I ordered my food and was drinking sweet tea,” Gipson said.
That’s when the restaurant manager told him he’d had to leave and called police. “You can’t have a dog in the store,” Gipson said the manager told him. He tried to explain that Bear is a service dog, but it didn’t help, he said.
A Cobb County police officer also arrived at the restaurant and told Gipson the restaurant was private property, so Bear would have to leave, Gipson said. Gipson said he tried to show the officer identification for Bear.
“He wouldn’t even look at it,” Gipson said. “He said he knew the law.”
You can RTFA if you enjoy reading crap shucking and jiving from restaurant managers or police departments populated with coppers who don’t know a damned thing about law and order.
I don’t encourage lawsuits as a rule; but, I hope Taylor Gipson riles up Popeyes’ corporate suits enough that they bend the ear of managers about service dogs.

The Lovin' Spoonful: Summer in the City [ purchase ] You can feel the 1960s heat rising off of The Lovin' Spoonful's "Summer in the City."

All that remains from the original is the chorus (which sounds more like a typical Spoonful song than the rest of the song).

For centuries, mankind has been looking to reverse the aging process and increase fertility. However, till today, the elixir of youth has been out of reach and the search is ongoing. We still do not know why the aging process takes place. Scientists have not been able to find answers to this conundrum.
However, what we know is that many things within the body work together to age the body. Aging has a lot to do with our genes. This may explain why people from some cultures tend to age better than people from other cultures.
Aging begins at a cellular level. The cells undergo oxidation and this causes aging to occur. Scientists are of the opinion that the free radicals that form within the cells are responsible for causing the aging process. As a cell grows old, it can no longer divide. This leads to the aging process as the cell dies.
If one can reverse the aging process, then a person will be fertile for a longer period of time. This is especially true for women. Unfortunately, menopause is a fact of like that women have to accept. However, the aging process can be reverse using certain surgical procedures or injections. However, the long term effects of some injections like growth hormone are not yet known. So, there is always a risk involved.
There are also natural remedies that can assist in slowing down the process of aging. Many of these remedies are based on the person's lifestyle and habits. So, things like consuming alcohol, smoking or taking illegal drugs should be avoided. In addition, cutting down the consumption of processed foods, tea and coffee is also advisable. Some herbal remedies that are available help to increase vigor and also vitality. These remedies have been used from ancient times and have been effective in slowing down the aging process.
While there is still no way of reversing the aging process, one can definitely slow it down using the different available measures.

Chasing Alliecat
In this action-packed thriller written for a young adult audience, author Rebecca Fjelland Davis brings multiple themes to the forefront, places them on the table and gets dirty—dirty as in riding mountain bikes in the woods of a small town and scarily getting involved with some unsavory characters in the wilds of northern Minnesota. With a plot interwoven with themes of death, friendship, family, and abuse, this novel provokes your senses and makes it all worthwhile. At the end of the novel, you hope for a sequel, because you want to know what is going to happen next for the well-drawn characters.
Sixteen-year old protagonist Sadie Lester arrives to stay with her aunt and uncle's home in the woods for the summer and expects the worst. Hoping to escape from her eternally fretting aunt and her wacky uncle, Sadie takes her bike out for a spin and meets Allison Baker (known as Alliecat). Alliecat appears a bit rough around the edges, but she eagerly invites Sadie to ride with her and to enter a mountain bike competition upcoming in the area. She also keeps her life mysteriously guarded; this curious character keeps the the story flowing. Soon after becoming friends the two girls, along with Sadie's cousin Joe, come upon a nearly dead body in the woods. Uncharacteristically, Alliecat disappears, leaving both Sadie and Joe to face new worries.
Along with her complex handling of the plot, Davis also lends her experience as a serious bicyclist to the novel. References to contemporary cyclists and technical bicycle machinery dot the surface of the novel as the story unfolds. The camaraderie of the bicycling community offers a support system for the main characters as they experience fear in dealing with difficult situations.
This story keeps the reader guessing. The mystery unfolds as the characters mindfully try to figure out what is going on and how to protect themselves. Multiple themes, many of them somewhat mature (including death, relationships, and abuse), become a little overwhelming, but the author delivers enough information to tie up loose ends as well as to insert her ideas of the young peoples' thoughts and needs to make the story complete.
Winner of the honorable mention in the Loft Award for Children's Literature/Older Children, Chasing Alliecat is quite an accomplishment. Davis opens up an amazing door of adventure.

Thanks Alison for this great post on the 2013 color of the year. I love emerald and will definitely be wearing it this year! Xx EB
Happy New Year, everyone! I hope 2013 is off to a smashing start for all of you. I’m Alison from NYC Recessionista and I am back for my fourth guest post. I’ve already shown you how to mix bargain basement & designer, how to season-swap, and how to rock retro.
Now I want to focus on colors. Well, one special color in particular. If you haven’t heard by now, Pantone recently proclaimed that the Color of the Year for 2013 is Emerald.
It’s a gorgeous color – and green is probably my favorite hue in the entire rainbow. But how many green pieces can you really go out and buy before you start looking like the Jolly Green Giant? Should you invest in green jewelry or green blouses? How can you incorporate emerald into your wardrobe on a budget? I’m here to help!
I think that one of the easiest ways to try out a new color or trend is through your jewelry and accessories – they’re lots of fun to play around with, it’s less of an investment, and if the color should happen to go out of style, you won’t have to replace everything in your closet.
Here are some of my favorite picks for affordable Emerald jewelry –
1) BaubleBar Green Akasha Strand Necklace
2) Max & Chloe Green Agate Cigar Ring
3) Macy’s Bar III Gold Tone Emerald Crystal Oval Stud Earrings
4) Ruche Waldorf Bow Bangle Set
5) Anthropologie Polished Planes Earrings
And I dare you not to be green with envy over these Emerald accessories –
1) Target Mossimo Supply Co. Floral Loop Scarf
2) J. Crew Wide Cashmere Wrap Scarf
3) Target Merona Skinny Belt
4) Banana Republic Pinking Shears Tote
5) Modcloth All-Star Bag
And if you want to experiment with the color of the year with your clothes or shoes, there are affordable ways to do that, too. Just make sure you’re buying classic pieces.
These pieces of clothing have such a beautiful pop of green color –
1) Ann Taylor Shirred Silk Blouse
2) Anthropologie Draped Tie-back Dress
3) Gap Skinny Ankle Pants
4) Madewell Silk Charmeuse Shirt in Dotdash
5) Target Merona Double Breasted Classic Peacoat
You can even rock the Emerald trend all the way down to your toes –
1) Target Merona Cap Toe Flats
2) Modcloth Pecking Border Heels
3) Converse Chuck Taylors
4) Seychelles Dipped in Gold Heels
5) Target Merona Ankle Strap Heels
If this first look at the Pantone colors of spring 2013 is any indication, 2013 is going to be another year for bright, cheerful and bursting hues on the fashion scene. By either playing around with jewelry and accessories, or making a bold statement with clothes and shoes in classic styles, you too can take the Emerald plunge this year. I hope this post gave you some ideas to star incorporating Emerald into your wardrobe on a budget!
PS – for lots more Emerald madness, be sure to check out my Pinterest board.
Which of these emerald pieces would you add to your 2013 wardrobe?

I like expressly Elizabeth! Green.

BANANAS
Hurrah for bananas. They are kind of like WD40 or those dryer sheets. . .

A professor at CCNY for a physiological psych class told his class about bananas. He said the expression "going bananas" is from the effects of bananas on the brain. Read. </ I> !!!

Nice tips. If I may adds, although bananas have a high iron but we must remember that banana also having a quite high Calcium and its not good for iron absorbtion, resulting in not too good for helping people with anemia.
Furthermore, if you insist in eating banana for treating Anemia, just try don’t eat it together with coffee, tea, milk because they tend to lower iron absorbtion, but you should eat banana together with vitamin C rich fruits, such as Orange.

Alright, so it's not that dark of a job but at least now it is a bit brighter. I painted my entry/laundry room over our break and it looks so much cleaner and fresher. Last year sometime in one of my painting fits I painted that room a muddy gray/brown color. It just felt so dark in there and just dirty.
This is what it originally looked like about two years ago:
A bit crowded, the dogs stayed in here as well and it just wasn't working for me.
Here is what it looked like after the painting fit with the muddy color.
Now it was just dark and small and still no room.
So we built a little locker to put our shoes, hats, mittens, etc.
That seemed to work well but every time we opened the door we would get hooked on the chicken wire and or the kids would get scratched.
So I had enough and last Friday we went and picked up some white paint and went to town.
Here is what it looks like now.
I took off the chicken wire from the locker and we replaced it with beadboard.
No more poking and scratching and I just love the look of it, much cleaner lines for me.
Picked up a few baskets from Meijer and TJ Maxx to give it that natural coastal feel,
and shopped around the house for some other treasures to add like my whale and some beach grass and rug.
(not sure why there is a phone plug in the laundry room, for the life of me I can't imagine why they put it there)
We also got a new washer, I was done cleaning up floods and having my clothes smell nasty. The salesman said that the biggest complaint of the front load washers is the smell but he couldn't tell us why the dumb thing flooded all the time, he thought perhaps we had a lemon......no kidding!
I love my new top loader and now with a bright clean room and a new machine, washing is actually tolerable. :)
There are still a few details that I would like to do like a new light and I have to paint the ceiling which probably would have been smart to do first, but I don't think that way. I can see by the last picture that I need an outlet cover too.
Details, details. :)
I love how how it turned out and even though there is less room with the washer and dryer having to be side by side now, it still feels bigger to me.
I heart white paint.

Michelle,
The room looks so fresh and open! You did an amazing job. I hate my front loader too. If I forget to leave that stupid door open for one day, the whole room smells. If it breaks, i will probably go back to the top loader too! I have also been toying with the idea of repainting my laundry room in a lighter color too! After seeing yours, I think I may do it...after the 3,000 other things I need to do! Have a great day!
-Shelley
Light and bright.....so gorgeous.
Hi Michelle- love your new laundry room. Looks great. We bought a new washer on Black Friday-- ours is a Maytag. Top loader. I.LOVE.IT.
I think it does a WAY better job than my front loader did. Does yours have an agitator inside? Mine has a small little 'plate' inside, no agitator.
enjoy.
Pat
Oh Michelle, it's gorgeous. I agree the white paint makes the room look so much bigger. I love all of your coastal touches. Beautiful job, my friend!!
PS. I received my book in the mail yesterday. Thank you so much!!!
This is such a pretty redo of your laundry room! I agree, it looks more open even though you have the washer and dryer side by side. It's amazing what some paint can do to make things feel better!
Ok, wow. Seriously, wow! It looks so bright and fresh! I love that you used beadboard on the cabinet - I've always considered doing the chicken wire a few of my cabinets but worried about the scratches. LOVE the idea you used!!
me too! it works miracles, doesn't it? the space looks inviting, clean and pure!
bravo, sista.
michele
I really like how the washer and dryer are side by side now. It seems to make the room look bigger!
I also love those baskets on the wall. I've been thinking about adding some to our dining room wall but haven't found the right ones yet.
Great job, girl!
It´s great and airy - good place to work. :-)
Wow that was HUGE transformation! I love the results and the beadboard on the locker. I have to say I absolutely loving that Michigan sign too! Must be something about spring - we are talking about tackling the laundry room next :).
amazing what some nice white paint will do! it is so pretty!
Its gorgeous but I soooo loved the chicken wire locker.
Looks wonderful Bead board can solve many design dilemmas in the home. :-))
It looks so much better. Although I loved the looks of the chicken wire I like the practicality of the beadboard...plus it kind of hides any mess the kids leave!
That is my next job here, too, doing something with my laundry room...wait...2nd project. First up is redoing hubby's office cuz the mess in there drives me crazy everytime I have to walk by it! UGH- xo Diana
looks great, so bright and airy! love all your accessories, and that beadboard door idea was brilliant! we have a phone in our laundry room too!
it looks fantastic! so light and fresh and CLEAN! love the baskets on the walls too and the bead board on the cabinet. i paint backwards too, ceiling last, because i am a moron like that ;)
i have a top loading washer and will never get a front load one after all the smelly/moldy things i hear about them...your new one looks great!
It turned out great - looks brighter and it seems more open too.
Your laundry room looks great...nice and fresh! I love the bead board on the cabinet too.
Hey, was your old washing machine a Kenmore? It looks almost like the one I just got. Ughh, I hate mine!!! It floods all over the place too, especially when I wash towels. I called about it and they told me I have it on too high of a spin speed, but the thing is, when I put it lower they come out sopping wet.
YES!!!!!! MUCH BETTER! I think the clean lines do it. And unstacking the washer/dryer adds more room! Michelle, you are a master painter and decorator!!!! Anita
light and bright - yeah for you! Love those baskets too!
So fresh! Love the baskets and the lockers. I have a front loader and have always left the door open a bit when I'm not using it. So far no smell issues. Your room looks really nice! Great idea with the beadboard too cause you can hide any messes.
Looks amazing now. I love the baskets you picked out. The beadboard looks pretty too, good idea to switch it out.
Oh it's beautiful! I'm at the first stages of designing mine (in my head) and have just spent six hours doing laundry & ironing in anticipation of visitors vacationing here for two weeks (I just want to enjoy the company with no distractions). Your post has really cheered me up because you have made it so bright and fresh. Lots of inspiration for us, thanks so much for sharing, Sally x
Your laundry room looks soooo pretty!!! I am crazy in love with the baskets on the wall! The locker is a great piece! I think it would be cute with some gray numbers on it. Have you seen those Pottery Barn lockers? That's what your piece reminds me of.
The transformation is beautiful. it's fresh, organized, very beachy and its giving the whole space a very clean appeal. I am loving this laundry Michelle.
Also, I dont know if I have told this to you before, the track on your blog, that plays the first is amazing. It takes me to green hills, blue seas, drift wood and home. I mean every word of it.
gorgeous michelle! yep white paint is the best.
x
Now, that's how laundry should go! It's a lovely change! Have a beautiful weekend, Kellie xx
It looks amazing Michelle! Love it - white is so the way to go. Im a little obsessed with it. Take care xx Nat
Hello sweetheart!
Oh my goodness...the white looks so fresh and beautiful!
The beadboard looks fantastic and I love the whole feel of the room.
The baskets are a beachy touch...it all looks like laundry could be actually enjoyable!!
:)
Oh and I adore that lake Michigan sign...so lovely!
I'm so happy for you love!!
All my heart,
Deborah xoxoxooxoxoxoxox
Everything looks absolutely beautiful Michelle! The white really does make a huge difference and the baskets on the wall are genius my friend! :-)
Vanessa
Great job - the room looks so inviting now! I must say though, that the wall color in the first picture looked very nice too ... - but change feels good and i admire you for your energy!
It looks amazing, Michelle! I would actually find laundry to do, just to be in that space :) Looks fresh and clean and bright. Love the rug. Do you know where you got it?
Very pretty, fresh and clean!
It would make me want to do my laundry :), Happy weekend ,friend!
So pretty Michelle!
I think I would want to hang out and do laundry!
Wow, it turned out great, light and airy. I have a great front load washing machine, I have had it FOREVER, it is one of the original ones from Sears and I fear having to try to replace it (once it goes) as I have heard so many horror stories of the newer ones being a pain like yours.
I think your laundry room looks great! We need to do ours (its country rust still from the late 80's....gasp).
So your job is inspiration to me! Glad to read your comment too about the washer, we are due & I wanted to get a top loader too! Glad to hear your testimonial and now I can feel confident getting the top load!
Wonderful job!
p.s.s was doing some back reading and noticed your driftwood mirror!...AMAZING...very inspiring! Thanks!
Makeover upon makeover...you're such a busy little bee. Too bad about losing valuable space with the loss of a stackable unit. However, this arrangement looks terrific...very fresh...I always love a single starfish inserted into a grouping.
Michelle, it looks fantastic! You couldn't have picked a fresher, nicer color for the walls, and I love the basket accents.
So lovely and fresh! I hope my laundry room looks this clean and bright some day!
Kelle
Xoxo
This looks so crisp and fresh. I love how it turned out

Soulless by Gail Carriger
The Parasol Protectorate #1
Fantasy/Horror/Romance, Published 2009
Challenges: Series Challenge IV, Fangtastic Fiction Challenge, RIP V Challenge
Read: Sept 2010, 357 pp
Verdict: 5/5
Book:
What a fantastic beginning to a new series (just what I needed…)! Set in a very proper Victorian setting, with a generous use of 19th century syntax, along with vampires and werewolves living out in the open, Alexia is quite the lady, a spinster at twenty-something, she has quite given up on finding a husband and spends her time being bothered by her family, keeping up with her many social circles, and neutralizing the supernatural. She is a rare breed, indeed, a preternatural, and is friends with both the vampires and werewolves, often acting as their liaison. I loved Alexia’s wit and sharp bite (pun intended), especially the back and forth between her and Lord Maccon. And watch out for her parasol!
Carriger brings a lot of fun, eccentric characters, to say the least, to her alternative world and I hope we will get to know them better throughout the series. There is a lot going on in this book – {mystery, alternate history, romance, fantasy, and a dash of steampunk} – and while it is technically listed as an urban fantasy/horror, it should really be found in the paranormal romance section, IMO. There is no real horror, no really gruesome or violent details, unless you don’t like the mystery arc taking a back seat to the romance about half way in.
Warning: This book is Rated R for sexual content.
Quotes:. -p. 1
“Why is it Miss Tarabotti, every time I have to clean up a mess in the library, you just happen to be in the middle of it?” the earl [Lord Maccon] demanded of her. -p. 8

as it violates type aliasing. Many compilers implement, as a non-standard language extension, the ability to read inactive members of a union.
#include <iostream> union S { std::int32_t n; // occupies 4 bytes std::uint16_t s[2]; // occupies 4 bytes std::uint8_t c; // occupies 1 byte }; // the whole union occupies 4 bytes int main() { S s = {0x12345678}; // initalizes the first member, s.n is now the active member // at this point, reading from s.s or s.c is UB std::cout << std::hex << "s.n = " << s.n << '\n'; s.s[0] = 0x0011; // s.s is now the active member // at this point, reading from n or c is UB but most compilers define this std::cout << "s.c is now " << +s.c << '\n' // 11 or 00, depending on platform << "s.n is now " << s.n << '\n'; // 12340011 or 00115678 }
Each member is allocated as if it is the only member of the class, which is why
s.c in the example above aliases the first byte of
s.s[0].
If members of a union are classes with user-defined constructors and destructors, to switch the active member, explicit destructor and placement new are generally needed:
#include <iostream> #include <string> #include <vector> union S { std::string str; std::vector<int> vec; ~S() {} // needs to know which member is active, only possible in union-like class }; // the whole union occupies max(sizeof(string), sizeof(vector<int>) int main() { S s = {"Hello, world"}; // at this point, reading from s.vec is UB std::cout << "s.str = " << s.str << '\n'; s.str.~basic_string<char>(); new (&s.vec) std::vector<int>; // now, s.vec is the active member of the union s.vec.push_back(10); std::cout << s.vec.size() << '\n'; s.vec.~vector<int>(); }
If two union members are standard-layout types, it's well-defined to examine their common subsequence on any compiler.
[edit] Anonymous unions
An unnamed union definition that does not define any objects is an anonymous union definition.
Anonymous unions have further restrictions: they cannot have member functions, cannot have static data members, and all their non-static data members must be public.
Members of an anonymous union are injected in the enclosing scope (and must not conflict with other names declared there).
int main() { union { int a; const char* p; }; a = 1; p = "Jennifer"; }
Namespace-scope anonymous unions must be static.
[edit] Union-like classes
A union-like class is any class with at least one anonymous union as a member. The members of that anonymous union are called variant members. Union-like classes can be used to implement tagged unions.
#include <iostream> // S has one non-static data member (tag), three enumerator members, // and three variant members (c, n, d) struct S { enum {CHAR, INT, DOUBLE} tag; union { char c; int n; double d; }; }; void print_s(const S& s) { switch(s.tag) { case S::CHAR: std::cout << s.c << '\n'; break; case S::INT: std::cout << s.n << '\n'; break; case S::DOUBLE: std::cout << s.d << '\n'; break; } } int main() { S s = {S::CHAR, 'a'}; print_s(s); s.tag = S::INT; s.n = 123; print_s(s); }

There have been a lot of questions recently about how to deal with blog scrapers, and i thought it might be useful to put up a step-by-step guide for sending a DMCA notice (or not).
Next time you see that someone has been stealing your content, try to follow these steps:
1. Determine if they have taken an entire post or if it's an excerpt that then links back to you
2. If it is an excerpt with a link, don't worry about it and ignore it, even if the excerpt contains inaccuracies. It would probably be considered "fair use", and you would be wasting your time trying to stop it. Think of it as advertising for your blog.
3. If it is an entire post, find out the contact information for the site by using
a. In the section entitled "Find Out Who Owns a Domain Name", enter the domain name
b. Click "Search WHOIS"
c. The contact information should appear under "Registrant"
d. If there is no contact information, scroll further down the page to the IP address, and click on it
e. A new window will open, and information about the host of the IP address will be listed
4. Send a DMCA notice to the domain registrant and the host. A sample follows, just replace the bracketed information with the correct corresponding info.

Mickey CassidyDiscuss0
this wiki
(written from a Production point of view)
Mickey J. Cassidy is a stuntman and stunt actor who portrayed the mirror universe character Private M. Romero in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode "In a Mirror, Darkly". He received no credit for his appearance. His costume was sold off on the It's A Wrap! sale and auction on eBay. [1]
Cassidy is the son of stuntman and stunt coordinator Michael Cassidy and the brother of stunt performers Zane Cassidy and Mariah Cassidy. Because of his fathers connection to the stunt business, Cassidy got at early age into the movie and television business. His first experiences were the science fiction fantasy film The Ewok Adventure (1984, with Fionnula Flanagan and Darryl Henriques, stunt coordinated by his father and with stunts by Frank James Sparks) and the family comedy Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989, with Matt Frewer, Amy O'Neill, Mark L. Taylor, Frank Welker, Craig Richard Nelson, and stunts by Cherie Tash). For the letter one he performed three high fall stunts and finally earned his SAG card. Cassidy doubled actor Macaulay Culkin on most of his '90s films and set a world record at the age of 13 while performing a 170' decelerator fall off a cliff on the drama The Good Son (1993).
Cassidy doubled lead actors, portrayed supporting roles, and performed stunts in feature films such as the comedy sequel Problem Child 2 (1991, with Zach Grenier, Diane and Elaine Klimaszewski, and stunts by Caron Colvett, Gene LeBell, and Zane Cassidy), Steven Spielberg's fantasy adventure Hook (1991), the sport film D2: The Mighty Ducks (1994, with stunts by Brian Avery, Christian J. Fletcher, and Pat Romano), the comedy Getting Even with Dad (1994, with Saul Rubinek and Ron Canada), the animated fantasy film The Pagemaster (1994, with Ed Begley, Jr., Christopher Lloyd, and the voices of Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Picardo, and Frank Welker), Richie Rich (1994), Casper (1995), and the comedy Spy Hard (1996).
He has also performed stunts in David E. Kelley's acclaimed drama series Picket Fences (starring Ray Walston and Kelly Connell) and portrayed supporting parts in the drama The Adventures of Huck Finn (1993, with Leon Russom and Dion Anderson) and the comedy Free Enterprise (1998, starring William Shatner and with Thomas Hobson, Diana Cignoni, Deborah Van Valkenburgh, Chase Masterson, Mark A. Altman, and Daren Dochterman).
After a longer break he returned in 2003 he has doubled several leading actors in the daytime soap The Bold and the Beautiful (2003-2006), including Jack Wagner, Dax Griffin, and Matthew Borlenghi. Cassidy has also performed stunts in Sam Mendes' drama Jarhead (2005), the television special All That 10th Anniversary Reunion Special (2005, alongside his father and brother), and in an episode of Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide (2007, with Rob Steiner and stunts by Vince Deadrick, Jr., Mark Ginther, and Danny Downey).

Vulcan historyDiscuss34
this wiki
The history of the Vulcans has been a long journey from the ancient civil wars that nearly destroyed Vulcan, to their embracing of logic through the teachings of Surak.
OriginsEdit came to light in 2268 with the discovery of Sargon and his people. When Sargon explained that his people colonized many worlds in the galaxy half a million years ago, Spock theorized that Vulcan might have been such a colony world. According to Spock, "That would tend to explain certain elements of Vulcan prehistory." (TOS: "Return to Tomorrow")
Ancient historyEditEdit
- For main article, see Time of Awakening.
By the 4th century, Vulcan was tearing itself apart. Their rampant emotions, combined with a hostile warrior culture, led to many wars using terrible weapons like atomic bombs and the Stone of Gol. But out of this emerged a philosopher named Surak, who proposed leading a life governed by logic rather than emotion. His teachings quickly spread and were recorded in the Kir'Shara, finally showing Vulcan a path towards peace.
Although his katra was saved, Surak himself later died of radiation sickness on Mount Seleya, which eventually became one of the most revered sites on Vulcan. (TOS: "The Savage Curtain", TNG: "Gambit, Part II", ENT: "The Forge", "Awakening", "Kir'Shara")
However, one group still opposed allowing logic to govern their lives. "Those who marched beneath the Raptor's wings," as Surak called them, fought a final war with the rest of Vulcan and were eventually forced to leave the planet, becoming the ancestors of the Debrune and the Romulans. (TOS: "Balance of Terror", TNG: "Gambit, Part II", ENT: "Awakening", "Kir'Shara")
Return to spaceEdit
By the 19th century, Vulcan had rebuilt its civilization and returned to interstellar travel. (ENT: "The Forge")
20th and 21st centuriesEdit
According to Quark, the Vulcan invention of warp drive occurred some time after 1947. (DS9: "Little Green Men") By 1957, Vulcans had several warp-capable starship classes in use, such as the D'Vahl-type starship and the survey ship. (ENT: "Carbon Creek") After the invention of warp drive, it took Vulcans a hundred years to design an engine capable of breaking the warp 2 barrier. (ENT: "First Flight")
By the early 20th century, Vulcan had made contact with the Tellarites. Vulcans considered Tellarites argumentative, but "generally reliable" and they were known to pass on Vulcan distress calls to the Vulcan High Command. (ENT: "Carbon Creek", "Dead Stop")
Contact with the Andorians also came during the early 20th century.")
By the mid-20th century, Vulcans were observing Earth and the Human civilization that inhabited it, but never made contact because they were deemed too primitive. (ENT: "Carbon Creek", Star Trek: First Contact) The Vulcans were startled, however, by the launch of the first Human-made artificial satellite into orbit – "Sputnik," in 1957. Surprised that Humans were advancing towards spaceflight so quickly, Vulcan survey ships began making routine flybys through the Sol system, to keep an eye on how Humans were developing. These Vulcan watchers limited their observations to remote studies from high orbit. (ENT: "Carbon Creek") Cochrane's first Human warp-speed flight. The survey ship followed Cochrane's vessel back to his base in Bozeman, Montana, to meet the man who had achieved Earth's first faster-than-light travel, and subsequently established formal diplomatic relations with Earth.

Vulcan reformationEdit based on Xindi technology, and planned to invade Andoria in order to preempt this threat. For this purpose, the High Command secretly massed an attack fleet in the Regulan system, which was located inside Vulcan territory, near their border with the Andorians but outside of Andorian listening posts' range.
As these plans were developing, agents loyal to V'Las bombed Earth's embassy and framed the Syrrannite T'Pau for the act. Jonathan Archer, investigating the Syrrannites, was briefly joined with the katra of Surak, and re-discovered the Kir'Shara, an artifact containing the original writings of Surak.
Ambassador Soval and Commander Tucker warned the Andorians of the planned invasion, were Ambassador Soval was terribly tourtured when the Andorians didn't believe them, and the Vulcan attack fleet lost the element of surprise (see Battle of Andoria). As the battle got underway, Archer and T'Pau brought the Kir'Shara into the High Command's headquarters, justifying the Syrranites' position and enabling Minister Kuvak to challenge V'Las' increasingly illogical behavior.
In short order, the attack on Andoria was canceled, V'Las deposed, and the High Command disbanded. Kuvak and T'Pau formed a new transitional government, which promised to pursue peaceful policies and end its restrictions on Earth's technological development and expansion. T'Pau said it would take years to translate all of the writing, but the discovery of the Kir'Shara transformed Vulcan society, initiating a widespread return to the true teachings of Surak. (ENT: "The Forge", "Awakening", "Kir'Shara")
By 2154, capital punishment was still existing on Vulcan for a small number of offenses, including treason. (ENT: "Kir'Shara")
The Coalition of Planets and the FederationEdit
- the Babel Crisis, during which a secret mission by the Romulans involved the use of two Romulan drone-ships. The Romulan ships were able to camouflage themselves as various other vessels and managed to spread distrust and hostility among local powers around Vulcan. The Romulans nearly succeeded with their plans but Captain Archer of the Enterprise was able to settle the dispute and allied the Vulcans, Andorians, Humans,, Vulcan, Earth and other worlds realized the value of their joint work and were growing close to founding a Coalition of Planets in 2155. (ENT: "Demons", "Terra Prime") The new coalition became welded together in 2156, when the conflict with the Romulan Star Empire escalated into the Earth-Romulan War. A humiliating defeat of the Romulans by an alliance of Vulcan, Earth, Andorian, with the consent of the Vulcan Council, founded the United Federation of Planets in San Francisco, on Earth. (ENT: "Zero Hour", "These Are the Voyages..."; TNG: "The Outcast")
23rd centuryEdit")
In the alternate reality created by Nero's temporal incursion, the planet Vulcan was destroyed in 2258, rendering the Vulcan race an "endangered species." Over the next year, Spock led the survivors in the colonization of New Vulcan. (Star Trek; Star Trek Into Darkness)
On a less than positive light, the Klingon ambassador called Vulcans the "intellectual puppets of the Federation," while arguing before the Federation Council in 2286. Seven years later, the daughter of the Klingon Chancellor, Azetbur, underlined this posture by calling the Federation a "Homo Sapiens-only club." (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home; Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country)
24th centuryEdit
By the 24th century, Vulcan remained one of the principal Federation members, and was deeply involved in all levels of that society. By 2369, the Vulcans had a saying, known to the Federation: "We're here to serve." (DS9: "Captive Pursuit") A good example of this attitude is the Treaty of Alliance, which finally established a firm friendship between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, and whose drafting and negotiation during the first half of the century is mainly attributed to Sarek of Vulcan and his son, Spock. (TNG: "Yesterday's Enterprise", "Sarek"; DS9: "The Way of the Warrior"; VOY: "Alliances") Vulcans were also highly integrated in the command structure of Starfleet, namely with high-ranking officers like Rear Admirals Savar and Sitak. (TNG: "Conspiracy"; DS9: "Favor the Bold") Some Starfleet vessels also had entirely, or almost entirely, Vulcan crews – e.g., the USS Hera, the USS Intrepid and the USS T'Kumbra. (TNG: "Interface"; DS9: "Take Me Out to the Holosuite")
In 2368, an attempt at a Vulcan-Romulan reformation/reunification almost resulted in an invasion of Vulcan. It began when Ambassador Spock went to Romulus because the new Proconsul Neral convinced Spock he was ready to open formal relations with Vulcan. However, this form of "cowboy diplomacy" was in no way authorized by the Federation Council or Starfleet. It soon turned out to be a Romulan attempt to gain a foothold within the Federation by using the underground Romulan-Vulcan reunification movement as a cover. The incidence culminated in Romulan forces entering Federation space aboard Vulcan transport vessels and moving towards Vulcan under a guise of peace. However, their cover was exposed and the Romulans destroyed their own forces, while they were heading back to Romulan space. (TNG: "Unification I", "Unification II") Despite this setback, Spock stayed on Romulus, continuing to work for a rapprochement between Vulcans and Romulans over the following two decades. (TNG: "Face of the Enemy"; Star Trek)
After the discovery of the Bajoran wormhole in 2369, Vulcans were at the forefront of exploration in the Gamma Quadrant. Upon encountering the Wadi, a Vulcan ship was the first to make formal contact with a civilization from that region of the galaxy. (DS9: "Move Along Home") Vulcan science ships later encountered the Rakhari and found the remains of the Hur'q civilization. (DS9: "Vortex", "The Sword of Kahless")
Unfortunately, the Bajoran wormhole did not only bring scientific possibilities for the Federation and especially Vulcan, but also the Dominion threat. In late 2373, the Dominion War broke out and, during its early months, the Fifth Fleet had to fight Dominion forces near Vulcan. (DS9: "Favor the Bold") When Betazed fell in 2374 it meant a direct threat to Vulcan, a danger which became even more grave as the Dominion began building up its forces on the newly conquered world later that year. (DS9: "In the Pale Moonlight", "The Reckoning") However, the danger to Vulcan never materialized as the Dominion War ended in late 2375 with the Federation Alliance emerging victorious. (DS9: "What You Leave Behind")
In 2387, Ambassador Spock's efforts to facilitate an eventual Romulan-Vulcan reunification came to an abrupt end, when Romulus was destroyed by a nearby supernova. Although Spock could not prevent the destruction of Romulus, he attempted to prevent the supernova from spreading further by creating a red matter singularity which, however, also pulled him and the pursuing Romulan mining ship Narada into an alternate reality. (Star Trek)
Summary of key datesEdit
- 2,700 BC: Vulcan civilization of this time is described as barbaric, war-like, aggressive and savage.
- 3rd millennium BC: Vulcans begin to mentally train themselves to suppress their emotions.
- 9th century BC: Master Haadok and others found the P'Jem monastery on another planet.
- 4th century: Time of Awakening - As Vulcan is consumed by atomic wars, Surak proposes to embrace logic as a way to peace. Although his katra is saved, he later dies of radiation sickness on Mount Seleya. "Those who march beneath the Raptor's wings," leave the planet, becoming the ancestors of the Debrune and the Romulans.
- 14th century: The religious holiday of Rumarie ceases to be observed on Vulcan.
- 19th century: By this time Vulcan had rebuilt its civilization and returned to interstellar travel.
- Early 20th century: First contact occurs between Vulcans and Andorians. Relations between both species should remain rough over the following two centuries.
- 1957: Vulcans make unofficial first contact with Humans when a Vulcan survey ship, which had been investigating the launch of Sputnik I, crash-lands on Earth.
- 2050s: Vulcans make first contact with the newly warp-capable Arkonians. Their relationship quickly sours to a point where Arkonians would bear deep hatred towards Vulcans. During this time, the Vulcans are also aware of the Third World War on Earth, but choose not to interfere.
- 2063: Official first contact between Vulcans and Humans takes place after the T'Plana-Hath observes Humanity's first warp flight and then lands in Bozeman, Montana to meet its pilot.
- 2097: After the Vulcan High Command forces its evacuation, a treaty is signed in which the Vulcans officially claim the Andorian planetoid Weytahn. It is renamed Paan Mokar, and a surveillance satellite is placed in orbit in order to enforce the accord.
- 2151: Hidden beneath the monastery of P'Jem, a Vulcan listening post used to spy on their Andorian neighbors is uncovered by the crew of the Earth starship Enterprise and members of the Andorian Imperial Guard. After a warning and its subsequent evacuation, the installation is destroyed by the Andorians later that year, thereby dealing a severe blow to Vulcan-Andorian relations, which are already tense due to both power's ongoing vying

Replacement of the cups-drivers package

Compliance with upstream CUPS
openSUSE 11.3 provides a major cleanup of CUPS. Almost all our own patches were dropped to enforce a reset to almost 100% compliance with upstream. The main change is that the "/usr/lib/cups/" directory is used on all platforms (in particular no longer "/usr/lib64/cups" on the 64-bit x86_64 platform). For background information see in the Novell/openSUSE Bugzilla the Comment #2 to bug 575544: "adapt other printing packages to work with upstream compliant cups-1.4 on 64 bit platform" which reads in particular:
Upstream CUPS installs executables (in particular backends and filters) into /usr/lib/ in any case which is the right place. Compare /usr/bin/ there is nothing like /usr/bin64/ because for executables special ...64 directories do not make sense. In contrast libraries like libcups.so and libcupsimage.so must be installed into /usr/lib/ and /usr/lib64/ ... A positive side effect of this clean-up is that then it works much better to install third-party printer drivers (which usually install only into /usr/lib/cups/)
YaST printer module renewal
Since openSUSE 11.1 the YaST printer module was made completely new, see Archive:YaST Printer redesign in particular the sections "Basic Design Ideas" and "Basic Implementation Principles" where the latter also talks about "Strict Compliance With CUPS".
Current Issues
Parallel port printers do no longer work out of the box
Since openSUSE 11.4 the kernel does no longer load the 'lp' kernel module unless asked specifically to do so. More precisely udev does no longer provide static /dev/ nodes. When /dev/lp0 is opened to send data via the parallel port the 'lp' kernel module is no longer loaded automatically so that no data can be sent. In the end since openSUSE 11.4 it is by default no longer possible to use the parallel port for a printer.
If you are using openSUSE 12.1 or later, install the "parallel-printer-support" package, which creates a static udev node for the parallel port. Its purpose is to load the "lp" kernel module automatically the first time data is sent to the parallel port. Should you not find the package by using
zypper install or YaST Software Management module, make sure that openSUSE 12.1 is up-to-date and the official openSUSE 12.1 Update repository is enabled (it should be by default).
On openSUSE 11.4, in order to install the "parallel-printer-support" package, you can get it from the "Printing" repository via direct download from or use this One Click Install:
During the One Click Install a YaST Installation dialog may show up which asks to subscribe to the "Printing" repository plus a check box whether or not to "remain subscribed to this repository". Make sure not to remain subscribed to the "Printing" repository otherwise you will get the newest development packages regarding printing installed onto your system which could mess up the printing functionality of your system, see the Printing repository description
See also
HP devices not detected as usual
The CUPS command "lpinfo -v" (run it as root) or matching CUPS library calls to detect devices may no longer detect HP devices with HP's specific "hp:/..." connection but - if at all - only with the generic "usb:/..." connection. For plain printing both kind of connections should work but for anything else (e.g. device status via HP's "hp-toolbox", or scanning with a HP all-in-one device) the "hp:/..." connection must be used, see
The reason is that HP's backends "hp" and "hpfax" cannot run at the same time, see
A workaround for HP devices without fax is to disable the hpfax backend with the following command (as root):
chmod a-x /usr/lib/cups/backend/hpfax
Various printout failures with CUPS default "RIPCache 8m"
By default CUPS has only 8 MB RIPCache, see "RIPCache" at
This default exits since a long time and did not cause any issue. But since some time more and more weird issues regarding printout failures happen which are related to this low default. The root cause is that recent versions of Ghostscript changed the internal banding API but the CUPS raster driver was not updated accordingly in Ghostscript.
For example there might be no printout at all because "/usr/lib/cups/filter/pstoraster failed" or there is broken printout like in the attachment 380232 in the Novell/openSUSE Bugzilla.
If printout failures actually depend on the low default RIPCache value, it helps to add in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf a line like
RIPCache 128m
and restart the cupsd afterwards. Then the CUPS raster driver in Ghostscript gets more memory available so that rendering is done in full page mode and not in banding mode which avoids issues because of the changed banding API.
In some cases (probably only for color printing at high resolution with the Gutenprint driver) you may have to specify much more, e.g. 1GB with
RIPCache 1024m
of course provided you have at least 2GB main memory in your computer.

Eiffel Programming/Unfeatures
Eiffel Unfeatures — What you Won't See in the Language [edit]
Goto, break or the equivalent [edit]
Ever since the advent of structure programming the goto has been considered evil, yet many programming languages support it. Eiffel does not. The language is designed to uphold the principle of Single Entry/Single Exit.
Some people consider this a gross inefficiency and will labor endlessly to demonstrate arcane algorithms that are allegedly faster with a well-placed goto, or it requires fewer variables, or fewer lines of code. Others consider is a serious crimp to their writing style.
Yet there are two serious advantages to the principle of Single Entry/Single Exit. First, it encourages the programmer to think clearly about the implementation. In other languages, if you find yourself in getting into trouble deep inside a multiply nested loop, you bail out with a goto. In Eiffel, you have to rethink the structure of the code, often to the benefit of the final program.
Second, source code is read much more often than it is written. The absence of a goto statement makes it easier to grasp the implementation. There are no subtle tricks buried in the inner loop that can skip to some arbitrary location.
Globals [edit]
State shared via the once statement Allows precise control over sharing data
CamelCase [edit]
Underscore_notation_is_preferred_for_better_readability
Vs.
CamelCaseNotationWhichCanBeVeryDifficultToRead
Case sensitivity [edit]
True = true = TRUE
Overloaded Names [edit]
Overloaded names, also known as operator overloading, introduces ambiguity for the human programmer and reader of soruce code, and in some cases, for the compiler as well. Eiffel avoids this source of errors by not implementing it.

APIS Modules
This module is used to record details about an actual case and the supporting court information. A case is created when some type of determinate action has been taken. - I.e. a person has been apprehended, arrested and / or terminated and a Case File is being documented. All details of supporting investigation(s), incident(s) and person(s) are stored in the appropriate data tables and linked via the APISdataweb to the case record. A case may also have a restitution or civil demand record associated with it, giving you the ability to connect with your 3rd party Civil Recovery and Restitution companies. APIS allows for the attachment of digital photos or digital video which will display as part of the record.
An investigation record documents an active or completed investigation. The main purpose of an investigation record is to identify and explain details of the investigation and to manage investigation progress and results. There are two types of investigation records maintained within APIS - Employee Investigations and General Investigations.
An incident record is used to explain details and specifics on an event. It can involve a person, in which case the Incident record is linked to an existing Personal Record. Unlike a Case or Investigation, an Incident can be based on more than one individual. For example, if there were a protest with six persons apprehended, all six persons may be documented and directly linked to the single incident.
The Report Designer module is included with each installation and is extremely flexible, which allows for a high level of customization. Although APIS is designed with some very basic statistical reports, we provide an option for creating over a dozen customized reports to ensure that you are getting the data you want - the way you want it.
Talk about powerful! Here is where the good stuff happens. The administration module is included in all packages and allows you to configure the system the way you want it. You can set the field names and labels and customize drop-down boxes to create the data entry screens specific to your needs. Setting up the System Hierarchy is simple and allows easy manipulation of locations, regions, districts and divisions. User access can be set to specific area of responsibility, limiting access to specific location or region. User security levels are set up quickly and easily to facilitate adding new users and establishing authorizations within each module. System Administrators can access the configuration and add new users while Users are set to varying levels of access within each module. Viewer ID's can be set to allow view only access to details and data. There is quite a bit to do in this module including setting a standard for recovery amounts by state to coincide with state law, with company policy or both.
This module provides you the ability to perform your recovery in-house and manages and tracks information for restitution and civil recovery letters and payments. The APIS system automatically creates an account at the time a case is generated. Once approved, the account can be automated to produce demand letters that can be mailed to demand payment. This module acts as a mini accounting system to enter and track all payments and payment history.
This module helps you to effectively manage your internal employee award and incentive programs. Features include the ability to manage payments and budgets, as well as print award certificates.
This module streamlines the management of Missing Merchandise Discrepancy Reports between locations, warehouses and vendors. You can to track, monitor and resolve merchandise discrepancies including Known Stolen details, Suspected Theft; Discrepancies from the Distribution Center; Discrepancies for shipments between various departments from LP to Operations and from Inventory to Finance.

Redirected from William Maxwell Aitken, 1st Lord Beaverbrook
He was born in Maple, Ontario, Canada and at an early age his family moved to Newcastle, New Brunswick, the place he would always call home and where, at the age of thirteen, he published his first newspaper. Although he wrote the entrance examinations for Dalhousie University and registered at the St. John Law School, he did not receive any formal higher education.
As a young man, he made his way to Halifax, Nova Scotia where John F. Stairs, part of the city's dominant business family, gave him employment at his newly formed Royal Securities Corporation. Under the tutelage of Stairs, who would be his mentor and lifelong friend, Aitken engineered a number of large business deals and mega-mergers.
Soon, Aitken moved to England, where he bought and later sold control of the Rolls-Royce automobile company and began to build a London newspaper empire. He often worked closely with Bonar Law, another native of New Brunswick, who became the only Canadian to be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In 1911, he was knighted by King George V. During World War I, the Canadian government put him in charge of creating the Canadian War Records Office in London, England and Aitken then made certain that news of Canada's contribution to the War was printed in Canadian and British newspapers. Aitken also established the Canadian War Memorials Fund that evolved into a collection of War art by the premier artists and sculptors in Britain and Canada. His visits to the Western Front during World War I resulted in his 1916 book Canada in Flanders[?], a three-volume collection that chronicled the achievements of Canadian soldiers on the battlefields. After the War, he wrote several books including Politicians and the Press[?] in 1925 and Politicians and the War[?] in 1928.
Adding to his chain of newspapers, which included the London Evening Standard he bought the failing Daily Express in 1915 for the paltry sum of ₤17,000. Over time, he turned the dull newspaper into a glittering and witty journal, filled with an array of dramatic photo layouts and in 1918, he founded the "Sunday Express." By 1934, daily circulation reached 1,708,000, generating huge profits for Aitken whose wealth was already such that he never took a salary. Following World War II, the Daily Express became the largest selling newspaper in the world, by far, with a circulation of 3,706,000. He would become a "Fleet Street" Baron masterminded the British newspaper conspiracy of silence over their romance.
During World War II, he joined the British cabinet as minister of information and in 1940, Winston Churchill, the new British Prime Minister, would appoint him as minister of aircraft production and minister of supply. Under Aitken, fighter and bomber production increased so much so that Churchill declared: "His personal force and genius made this Aitken's finest hour".
After the war, Lord Beaverbrook served as chancellor of the University of New Brunswick and became the city of Fredericton's and the Province's greatest benefactor. He would provide additions to the University, scholarship funds, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Beaverbrook Skating Rink, the Lord Beaverbrook Hotel (profits donated to charity) and numerous other projects. His statue stands in the park in the heart of the city of Fredericton.
Lord Beaverbrook died in Surrey, England.

A 5-year-old boy died after falling from his family's 19th floor apartment in Zhabei district Sunday night after his parents left him home alone, the second time this month that an unattended child has fallen to his or her death in Shanghai, local media reported Monday.
The boy fell after his parents locked him in their apartment on Baotong Road Sunday evening so they could go to work, according to a report on the news website Xinmin.cn.
Neighbors reported that they heard the boy crying and banging on the door for hours before the accident.
One neighbor told Xinmin.cn that the boy eventually quieted down. The neighbor then saw the boy climb up the balcony railing and stretch out over the edge to look down. He slipped, then fell.
Police and emergency rescue personnel found the boy dead at the scene, according to the report.
His parents were running their small business at a nearby market when their son fell, according to police.
Police typically don't open investigations into the parents in such cases, which they consider accidental deaths, said Shi Fangni, a press officer with Zhabei police.
Parents are not usually punished for leaving their young children alone at home, said Rong Jinliang, a lawyer from the Juvenile Rights Protection Commission of the Shanghai Bar Association. "Unlike in Western countries where parents are not allowed to leave their children unattended for a long time, China doesn't have any regulations about this issue yet," Rong told the Global Times.
Earlier this month, a 2-year-old girl died under similar circumstances. The girl's mother had left her alone in the family's 10th floor apartment in Pudong New Area while she went to look for her husband, who was late coming home from a shopping trip.
The girl left the apartment, climbed through a hallway window and fell out.
Yang Yongming, director of the Shanghai Youth Protection Office of the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, advised parents to keep their young children with them.
"It is particularly dangerous to leave children who aren't old enough to go to school unattended at home because they cannot recognize danger. Working or going shopping is not an excuse to leave a small child alone," Yang told the Global Times.

HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has expressed his optimism over the future of Hong Kong, citing the sound foundation and unique advantage of the city as well as the central government's unswerving support to Hong Kong's development.
A series of supportive policies announced by the central government recently have demonstrated the resolution and sincerity of the motherland to help maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, said Peng Qinghua, director of the Liaison Office of the Chinese Central People's Government in Hong Kong.
Although the city is facing some new challenges and needs to address problems in the areas of economy and livelihood, the incoming government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has put forward its governing idea of "seeking changes while maintaining stability," which has been well recognized by the Hong Kong people, he said.
With the support of the motherland, Hong Kong will use its unique advantages to overcome problems. "I have full confidence in the bright future of Hong Kong," Peng said in an interview ahead of the 15th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China.

Thailand will impose a curfew and send Red Cross workers to evacuate women, children and the elderly from Bangkok's deadly protest zone where 25 people have been killed in three days of rolling street battles between anti-government activists and soldiers.
A towering column of black smoke rose over the city Sunday as protesters facing off with troops set fire to tires serving as a barricade. Elsewhere, they doused a police traffic post with gasoline and torched it. the military operation to quell protests was the answer in ending the country's two-month-long crisis.
"Overall, I insist the best way to prevent losses is to stop the protest. The protest creates conditions for violence to occur. We do realize at the moment that the role of armed groups is increasing each day," he said.
The Red Shirt protesters have occupied a 1-square-mile (3-square-kilometer) zone, barricaded by tires and bamboo spikes, in one of the capital's ritziest areas, Rajprasong, for about two months to push their demands for Abhisit to resign immediately, dissolve Parliament and call new elections.
Army spokesman Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd announced on national television the government will send the Red Cross and voluntary organizations into the protest zone to "invite or persuade people, especially women, children and older people to leave the area."
About 5,000 people are believed camped in the protest zone, down from about 10,000 before fighting started Thursday after a sniper shot and seriously wounded a Red Shirt leader.
It quickly spread to nearby areas, which became a no-man's land after the army set up barriers in a wider perimeter around Rajprasong. The area already resembled a curfew zone with no public transport or private vehicles. Most shops, hotels and businesses in the area are also shut. The government has shut off power and water supplies to the core protest zone. Schools were ordered shut Monday in all of Bangkok.
At least 54 people have been killed and more than 1,600 wounded since the protests began mid-March, according to the government. The dead include 25 killed since Thursday.
Sansern said the government has decided to impose a curfew in the violence-hit areas. The timing and the exact locations will be announced later, he said.
On Saturday, soldiers blocked major roads and pinned up notices of a "Live Firing Zone" in one area of Bangkok..
Demonstrators dragged away the bodies of three people from sidewalks — shot by army snipers, they claimed. Red Shirts, drawn mostly from the rural and urban poor, say Abhisit's coalition government came to power through manipulation of the courts and the backing of the powerful military, and that it symbolizes a national elite indifferent to the poor.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch on Saturday called on the Thai government to revoke the fire zones and negotiate an end to the fighting.
"By setting out these 'live fire zones' the Thai authorities are on a slippery slope toward serious abuses. It's a small step for soldiers to think `live fire zone' means `free fire zone,' especially as violence escalates," the rights watchdog said in a statement.
The Red Shirts especially despise the military, which forced Thaksin Shinawatra, the populist premier favored by the Red Shirts, from office in a 2006 coup. Two subsequent pro-Thaksin governments were disbanded by court rulings before Abhisit became prime minister.

So, with Murphy, it was calculated that for every dollar Murphy was paid for his last three films, they only returned an average of $2.30 at the box office.
Coming in second was "One for the Money" star Katherine Heigl. Her recent flicks only generated an average of $3.40 for every dollar she was paid.
Meanwhile, Reese Witherspoon placed third with an average $3.90 return for every dollar she was paid, stemming from such movies as 2010's "How Do You Know" and the recent "This Means War."

He flies into an asteroid belt — which somehow the Imperial Fleet had failed to account for when planning its hasty “blockade” — and the Falcon has defied the odds.
I would have guessed that since the odds of successfully navigating an asteroid belt are so low (as threepio notes) that the blockade used that as a natural barrier like you would a mountain or sea in an earthly battle. When they flew into it, nobody was expecting them to opt to be blown up in an asteroid belt and they reluctantly gave chase.

I think the author is missing the point about Vader's motives. The article said:
The author assumes that Vader actually cared about winning whatever military objectives the Empire had. I don't think he did. In Episode V, Vader wanted only one thing: to get Luke Skywalker. I imagine that after the Death Star was destroyed and there was a big ceremony highlighting to everyone in the Rebel Alliance that Luke was the hero, word got to the Empire (and Vader) that someone named Skywalker was involved. Vader may have claimed that the name had no meaning for him, but it certainly did. So that's why he went down to the base. He didn't trust the stormtroopers to be able to capture Luke; he was going to do it himself.
In Episode IV, Vader seemed to be nominally to be a team player (at least he stopped choking that guy in the conference room) and willing to take orders. By the time Episode V rolled around, Vader was off the leash. All he wanted was to get Luke to turn him into his Sith Apprentice and everything else (stormtroopers, admirals, star destroyers, what have you) was just fodder. So although I enjoyed the article, I don't think Vader's tactics weren't because of poor planning or insight. If every Rebel escaped and every Imperial died, it wouldn't matter to him if he captured Luke.

Vision
Imagine a world in which industry, yes, every factory and every building is as wasteful and as useful as a cherry tree in full bloom. A world, in which buildings – just like trees – use the sun’s energy, produce nutrients and oxygen, provide living space for other creatures, cleanse water, purify the air and even change to adapt to the seasons. A world without environmental pollution or waste, where only products with materials that are beneficial to both man and the environment are manufactured. A world, in which materials are of such high value that they flow in specially designed material cycles.
A world, in which humans can actually be pleased about the benefits their consumption has on the environment. A world, in which humans are freed from and no longer have to live under the restraints and limitations placed on them by always having to save, reduce, and cut down on certain things for the sake of the environment. That is exactly the kind of world that the Cradle to Cradle® design concept opens up to all of us.
The terms “Eco-efficiency” and “Eco-efficacy” are often used interchangeably. There is, however, a significant difference between the two. Rather than minimizing the material flows, eco-efficacy proposes the idea of transforming products and their respective material flows so that a workable relationship between ecological systems and economic growth is made possible. The aim here then is not to reduce or delay the cradle to grave material flow but rather to create metabolisms that allow for methods of production that are true to nature and in which materials are used over and over again.
The eco-efficiency approach takes into consideration only quantifiable parameters which outline those problems that should be minimized (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions) whereas the eco-efficacy approach additionally factors in qualifying parameters (e.g. the use of carbon dioxide as a nutrient). Cradle to Cradle®-design seeks to superimpose the principle of quality before quantity onto industrial systems. Materials and material flows are then designed in such a manner so as to be beneficial in terms of the regeneration of their biological and technological sources. Such an approach frees us from our current responsibility and duty to reduce or slow down any negative environmental effects our behavior has. As such, we can be freed from the restraints placed upon us as a result of our prevalent culture of self-blame.

Andrej Slapnik (2012) Employment of object-relational mapping with Apache Cassandra database. EngD thesis.
In this thesis I have checked what is the impact of using non-relational database managment system to solving one of the general problem. I have also checked how using ORM layer with non-relational DBMS contribute to efficent development. In the first part I have presented non-relational database managment system Apacahe Casasndra and descibed what distributed hash tables are. I have continued with description of the idea of additional applicative layer ORM and checked pros and cons of using it with Apache Cassandra. I the main part I have descibed the idea and development of my own ORM between PHP application and non-relational database. In chapter five I have descibed solving general problem and experiences I have got at designing and developing application. In the last part I have presented my findings and written few guides to other developers which can help at making decisions which technologies should they use at solving their problem.

Abstract
A generalized mass transport model is developed for predicting the rate ofdeposition in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) systems. This combines thegeneralized method of obtaining equilibrium composition, with elemental fluxbalance expressions. This procedure avoids the usual problems encountered incalculating the rates in multicomponent systems, like writing overall reactionschemes. The dependence of multicomponent diffusivities on the fluxes is accountedin this model using an iterative procedure. The model developed isapplied to the deposition of titanium carbide on cemented carbide tool bitsfrom a gas mixture of titanium tetrachloride, toluene, and hydrogen. Experimentaldeposition rates were obtained using a thermogravimetric assembly.Mass transport controlled rates give an order of magnitude estimates of theobserved rates.

Description/Abstract
The cognitive model of social phobia by Clark and Wells (Social phobia: Diagnosis, Assessment and treatment (1995)) proposes that individuals with social phobia generate a negative impression of how they appear to others, constructed from their own thoughts, feelings and internal sensations. This impression can occur in the form of a visual image from an external, or "observer", perspective. Although social phobics use this perspective more than controls, the impact of the observer perspective has not been tested experimentally. This study investigated the effects of taking the observer perspective on thinking, anxiety, behaviour and social performance in high and low socially anxious participants. Forty-four participants (N=22 in each group) gave two speeches, one in the observer and one in the field perspective. Use of the observer perspective produced more frequent negative thoughts, more safety behaviours, and worse self-evaluation of performance in both groups. There were also clear trends demonstrating increases in anxiety and in thought belief ratings in the observer perspective compared to the field perspective. Results are consistent with the Clark and Wells model of social phobia. This study also suggests that in low socially anxious individuals, the observer perspective may contain positive information.

Reductive cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine by biotin synthase from Escherichia coli

Description/Abstract
Biotin synthase (BioB) catalyzes the insertion of a sulfur atom between the C6 and C9 carbons of dethiobiotin. Reconstituted BioB from Escherichia coli contains a [4Fe-4S](2+/1+) cluster thought to be involved in the reduction and cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), generating methionine and the reactive 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical responsible for dethiobiotin H-abstraction. Using EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy as well as methionine quantitation we demonstrate that the reduced S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S](1+) cluster is indeed capable of injecting one electron into AdoMet, generating one equivalent of both methionine and S = 0 [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster. Dethiobiotin is not required for the reaction. Using site-directed mutagenesis we show also that, among the eight cysteines of BioB, only three (Cys-53, Cys-57, Cys-60) are essential for AdoMet reductive cleavage, suggesting that these cysteines are involved in chelation of the [4Fe-4S](2+/1+) cluster.

Apples with apples: Comparing the cost of capital
Publication Date
3-1-2004
Abstract
There is no point in debating the merits of public private partnerships, argues John Quiggin of the University of Queensland, since there is no alternative. In a mixed economy, any activity undertaken by government inevitably requires inputs from the private sector, and vice versa. It is a true comparison of the cost of capital that must be considered.

Mexican club Monterrey have had a bid rejected for Fulham defender Carlos Salcido.
• Fulham eye Menezes deal
• Fulham win Europa League spot
Mexico international Salcido, 31, joined Fulham from PSV last summer in a £1.6 million deal as a replacement for Paul Konchesky, but he has struggled to adapt to England and recently revealed that he had been close to joining Chivas in January.
"In January, I had been very near to returning to Chivas," Salcido said. ."
Monterrey have now made a bid to take Salcido back to his homeland but Fulham have turned down the offer, with Mark Hughes eager to keep him at Craven Cottage.
A Monterrey statement read: "We inform you that we have received a response from Fulham Football Club of England, declining our offer to sign Carlos Salcido."

Kolo Touré
- Full Name: Kolo Toure
- Squad No: 28
- Position: Defender
- Age: 32
- Birth Date: Mar 19, 1981
- Birth Place: Sokoura Bouake, Ivory Coast
- Height: 6' 0'' (1.83m)
- Weight: 74 kg
Teams
2012/13 Barclays Premier League
KOLO TOURÉ
One of Arsene Wenger's best value signings after his reported £150,000 purchase from Ivorian side Asec Mimosas, Toure was an integral part of Wenger's 2003-04 'Invincibles' side, forming a solid defensive partnership with Sol Campbell.
Toure had already earned 17 international caps when he joined the Gunners, aged 20, winning his first against Rwanda in 2000. He helped Ivory Coast to the 2006 African Nations Cup final, where he scored a penalty in the shootout defeat to Egypt, and played in the Elephants' inaugural World Cup appearance in 2006.
At Arsenal, Toure formed a useful partnership with William Gallas after the Frenchman signed in 2006, but after being passed over for the captaincy in favour of Gallas following Thierry Henry's departure, Toure reportedly had a bust-up with the Frenchman. His performance levels dipped and he demanded a move away from the club in January 2009.
That summer, Manchester City signed Toure for £16 million, with Mark Hughes valuing his experience so much that he appointed him club captain to lead his side's charge as they looked to challenge the Premier League's top clubs. His first season did not work out quite as hoped but, with brother Yaya among the players to have moved to Eastlands, he will be hoping for much more success in his second.
Strengths: Exceptional tackler and an all-round powerful centre back, with a great ability to intercept and solid aerial presence.
Weaknesses: Toure has often been criticised for occasional lapses in concentration and, particularly as he is the captain, he takes some of the blame for City's lack of organisation in defence in his debut season.
Career High: Winning the 2003-04 Premier League title with the Arsenal 'Invincibles' team.
Career Low: Losing the final of the 2006 African Nations Cup on penalties.
Style: Commanding centre back with bags of experience.
Quotes: " - Kolo Toure, March 2010
Trivia: Toure was the final regular starter from Arsenal's 'Invincibles' to leave the club when he departed for Manchester City in July 2009.

Gunners feeling the pressure
The Insider
If there is a flaw in Arsene Wenger's make-up, it comes with his reaction to a major setback.
The Gunners' boss explains just what it means to play for the Arsenal 'team'. (AdamDavy/Empics)
Few doubt that the brilliant Arsenal manager is one of the finest coaches in the world game, with his reputation as the master moulder of young talent secure whether his side end up collecting any silverware this season or not, yet when it comes to finding a way of rallying his troops when they have received a blow to the egos he has inflated, Wenger may have something of a blind spot.
You see, Monsieur Wenger has become one of the game's top winners purely on the basis that he is long established as one of its worst losers and his attitude of angst and frustration following a rare setback can rub off on his players in a manner that damages them severely.
Take the game at Old Trafford back in 2004 that saw his side's record-breaking 49-game unbeaten run come to an end. Instead of dusting himself down and remaining focused on the job in hand, he lost his cool and his players then try to react with anger an aggression rather than the silky football that makes them a great side.
'We cannot play when we are full of hate,' Wenger muttered to the media on Friday, yet after his afternoon from hell at Birmingham last Saturday, you always suspected this was going to be the most severe test of Arsenal's status as major contenders for the Premier League title.
The horror of Eduardo's tackle was compounded by the pathetic antics of captain William Gallas as he threw an almighty and tearful tantrum as the final whistle blew at St Andrews, leaving the dark horses for the title all season in a position where they needed to reaffirm their intent against a gritty Aston Villa side.
The 'let's do it for Eduardo' cry was noble, but the reality is Arsenal have a history of failing to bounce back when they feel as if the world is against them and thus was the case against a Villa side who were in no mood to show any sympathy.
It was with an air of determination that Arsenal set-out on their first game since the St Andrews disaster and while they could not be faulted for the urgency displayed in the opening exchanges, the raw pace of Theo Walcott was not enough to give them the lead they craved.
While it was something of a surprise to see Villa take a 27th minute lead, the warning signs had been there as the pace of Gabriel Agbonlahor had been concerning the Arsenal backline and as he burst down the left flank and squared to John Carew in the box, Philippe Senderos could only divert his clearance into the back of his own net.
If there were any fragile minds in the Arsenal camp, conceding the first goal of the game was likely to expose them and on a day when Wenger needed the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor and Cesc Fabregas to lift spirits, the two stars of their season to date were missing in action.
While Scott Carson made a few decent saves to maintain Villa's advantage, there was just as much work for Manuel Almunia down the other end, with the impressive Agbonlahor always a menace on the break and Marlon Harewood adding to the Villa threat when he was released from the bench late on.
Walcott's contribution would also have been a worry for Wenger as after his two goal showing at Birmingham last weekend, the English boy wonder fluffed his lines as he appeared to be little more than a one-trick pony in this game. If your trick results in a goal every now and again, then any side can cope with a luxury player, yet Walcott's pace is an asset that is rarely complimented by an end product.
In truth, this became a comfortable holding job for Villa and with Wenger pacing the touchline with increasingly animation antics, panic began to spread like a fatal disease around the Emirates Stadium. Every title race has a defining moment that counts for more than any other and this was rapidly feeling as if was the moment when Arsenal's challenge would unravel.
Even when time is short, this team like to play their way out of trouble and as they completed their 20-pass moves in front of a compact Villa backline, their demise was apparently inevitable, but they managed to drain one final chance out of the game and it earned them a point that keeps them on top of the table.
Substitute Nicklas Bendtner provided the finishing touch deep into injury time and Wenger's obvious relief on the touchline was confirmed as he met his admirers in the media. 'If we had lost this game, it would have been very hard for us to come back,' conceded a relieved Arsenal manager. 'As it is, I believe the point we have gained against a difficult opponent in Villa could be crucial come the end of the season.
'Manchester United are now the favourites for the title and they seem to have all the momentum, but we are still one point ahead at the top of the league and have to make sure the dip in form we have suffered comes to an end now.
'The desire in this team means we refuse to be beaten or to concede we cannot win this championship and while we clearly suffered a hangover from the events of the last week in this game, I hope we can grow once again from here.'
The leveller was cruel on a Villa side who battled so hard to secure what would have been a famous victory and manager Martin O'Neill struggled to hide his disappointment as he reflected on the glory that had passed him by.
'The mood is our dressing room is of desperate disappointment,' said the ex-Celtic manager. 'We feel like we have been beaten here and to play that well and only come away with a point is heartbreaking. We played brilliantly against a top class side and no one can dispute that we deserved to win the game. It is a sign of how far we have come that we can take on a side like Arsenal and play as well as we did.'
Arsenal are clearly beginning to crack and if they do go out of the Champions League in Milan on Tuesday, you wonder whether their demise will kick-off in earnest.
•
MAN OF THE MATCH: Gabriel Agbonlahor
- In the battle of the two speediest England strikers of the day, the Villa man stole all the accolades. He deserved to finish this game as a winner after he tormented the Arsenal defence throughout.
•
FOOD WATCH:
Rarely have the media been treated to the sort of culinary delight that was a beautiful piece of beef prior to kick-off. The dish would not been out of place in a top class restaurant.
•
SICK BRUMMIES:
The travelling Villa fans covered themselves in shame as they wasted just 14 minutes before signing derogatory songs comparing stricken Arsenal striker Eduardo to amputee Heather Mills-McCartney. It was an example of football fans sinking to gutter level.
•
INJURY NEWS:
Villa defender Curtis Davies is out for a lengthy period after rupturing his Achilles tendon. He will be operated on immediately.
•
ARSENAL VERDICT:
There can be little doubt that they are beginning to crack and you wonder whether the walls will tumble around Arsene Wenger if his side go out of the Champions League at the San Siro on Tuesday night. They are hanging on admirably, but look less like potential Premier League winners than ever.
•
VILLA VERDICT:
They may have been let down by their shameful supporters, but Martin O'Neill's side showed they are now a match for one of the Premier League's established big four. Along with Everton, they will push Liverpool close for a Champions League place.

So awesome, Andi! Thanks for sharing and go you for making such monumental changes! Food information becomes kind of addictive, doesn't it? I saw Food Inc in Feb of 2010, and that started it for me, and it's funny how I don't even think to buy some of the stuff I used to consider staples in my kitchen. I look forward to reading more of what you post in the next few weeks. :)
Katie, your blog has been a lot of inspiration. I know you've fought the good fight cutting out processed foods and making lots of healthy snacks/meals for you and your kiddos. Love love love reading your posts and trying your tips and recipes. :) You got me to cook tofu, for heavens sake!
Excellent! As someone who's been sucked into the Weight Watchers world for years, without reaching (or coming close to) goal, I'm so intrigued by this! I've often thought about "just" eating healthy, but have been afraid to try it without a structured program. So silly. I can't wait to read about your experience!
It sounds too easy doesn't it??? And if you're anything like me, you like to see quick results. That's the hardest part. That's why it was so effective for me to "forget" about it, and just let this happen over time. I used to jump on Atkins, lose 40 pounds in a few weeks or a month, but then it would yo-yo right back on. This feels like a forever thing!
Whoohoo! Congrats on those 40 lbs! And, what you've been doing, basically, is "Intuitive Eating (that's my old blog about it). You eat only when you're actually hungry, and you eat only enough to satisfy -- not stuff yourself. I lost 25 lbs this way back in 2005, and have been re-starting with it this year, and am pleased to announce that I'm already making progress, just one week in! :D
If you're interested, I just got offered a book for review that talks about both intuitive eating (though, he doesn't call it that), and choosing healthier foods... email me and I'll send you the contact info. I chose not to take him up on the review offer, as I don't need to read any more books on the subject -- I need to start PRACTICING what I've learned.
~MizB
Exactly! And I thought about your intuitive eating posts as I was going through this process. Good luck with restarting your own intuitive eating. Definitely want to know about the book. I'll FB message you. :)
Thanks for your blog. Congratulations with your progress and sharing your journey with us. Eating healthily and only when you are hungry are certainly the way to go. Best wishes for your ongoing quest.
Thanks, Diane! It sounds so simple but it's amazing how hard it was to internalize these simple steps for so long!
Congrats to you Andi! Keep up the good work.
After many failed attempts at dieting, I've finally found something that works. Exercise. When/if you get into the routine of exercising, you don't want to eat things that are bad for you. Before my hip replacement, I was walking a mile and a half on my treadmill and I'm hoping to get back to that level soon.
It's the only thing that works for me...focus on moving and the food will take care of itself. I also eat/keep a lot of fresh fruit, vegetables and nuts around.
Robin, I've been slow to adopt a full-on exercise routine. But this is another area where in the past I would jump in with both feet, burn out, and stop. I've taken to walking more at work -- even if it means a stroll around campus at work. I also am much more active around the house -- constantly cleaning, organizing, straightening, and playing with/chasing my son. That helps a lot too without the bore of tedious exercise.
Wow, what a great story! Cutting out all processed foods really helps, and I'm glad you noticed a major difference!
I stopped eating processed foods and ingesting chemicals in general (including medicines, prescription drugs, etc) in 2009, and I also lost tons of weight naturally. I actually still eat some of the same stuff I ate before (cookies, baked goods), but only the all-natural/organic versions, never anything processed.
I love these types of blog posts, and I can't wait to read your next update! :)
Thanks, Sarah Ann! I haven't made it to cutting out all processed foods, but I'd say I've cut our processed intake by about 60%. Tonight was an exhausted night and I needed something comfort-foody to take for lunch at work this week. I made a casserole out of leftover turkey, some noodles, green beans, and some canned soups and spices. I've cut down on the use of "cream of" by probably 80% and the next step is to make my own homemade versions for nights like this one!
This is awesome Andi! You're very right - it's about eating real foods, and enjoying what we eat, and knowing our hunger cues. I know too many people who try to lose by calorie deprivation, who are hungry all the time and think that their stomachs are the enemy. It's just too bad, because real permanent weight loss has nothing to do with dieting. This is fantastic!
Thanks, Amanda! Amen to real foods. Definitely have some blog posts coming up about that topic. I often find that I skip dinner. People's first reaction is "you're starving yourself!" But the truth of the matter is that I'm hungrier for breakfast and lunch, and by the time dinner rolls around I'm REALLY NOT HUNGRY! But there will be a post about that. lol
I find it's way easier for me to eat healthy when I'm working out regularly, because if I work my butt off at the gym I'm horrified at how many calories are in candy and stuff. If I'm not working out, I just don't care.
Lisa, I hear ya. I get extremely bored with exercise. I don't particularly like watching TV or anything while I'm on a treadmill; I much prefer scenery. It's a little binding in the fall/winter months when the days are short, so I find I purposely move more at work, stay on my feet more at home. All that good stuff. Exercise is tough for me, but there will be a post about that. lol
I'm with you - it should be easy. Eat less and exercise more, but why do we have such cravings?
Ann
Good for you! It's amazing what healthy eating can do for you. I bet you feel better too.
Amen! I feel much much better (except when I have a month-long cold). lol
Awesome, Andiloo! I gained weight after moving but it's probably because I'm exercising less. We have a new gym and I miss my old one like crazy. It was so friendly and inviting! Gotta get back to work on the flab. We're eating better, though -- lots of fresh veggies. In fact, Kiddo keeps looking in the fridge and saying, "What's up with all this HEALTH FOOD?" LOL He eats it if it's fixed for him but he doesn't know what to do with it, otherwise. He might need a crash course in cooking fresh veggies.
Can't wait to hear what all you've done and see your recipes!
Thanks, Nancy! I have never been a very good gym member. Maybe because I haven't found one that "fits" me. I used to find them intimidating, but now I have a problem of getting bored at the gym. I'm hard to please, obviously. lol
Congratulations, Andi! I've fought the weight battle too, and I know how tough it can be. But I also know that I've felt SO much better since I got to a healthy weight.
I've found that I can eat most anything I want if I do it in moderation and exercise on a regular basis. Part of that is, as you said, not eating unless you're hungry, plus learning to stop eating when you're full! It takes a lot less to fill up then you think! I've found an exercise I enjoy, so I can do it four or five times a week and I actually miss it when I can't do it.
Keep it up!
Thanks, Becca! Congrats to you on reaching a healthy weight! I'm well on my way. A lot left to do, but I'm pleased as can be with my progress thus far.
And yes, I haven't restricted myself a lot as I find I'll go nuts and binge on bad stuff if I'm too restricted. 90% of the time I eat wise choices, so I don't even feel guilty about splurging from time to time.
And what's your exercise of choice? I'm still searching. :)
Congrats. I'm with Robin and Bookfool on the importance of exercise -- not so much for the calories burned but the way it makes you feel-- so much better (and studies now suggest it affects not just self-image but mood and brain power) that you start eating better too.
I went through a very hard time many years ago -- not about weight but I did all kinds of things to make me feel better and change my routines.
At the grocery I tried to buy one new healthy thing -- something I had never bought before generally healthy stuff like weird fruit, new grains, vegetables that I had no idea how to cook -- things like kale and salsify. It made eating a little more interesting. Love kale. Have never bought salsify again.
Thanks, Barbara! And yes, I need those endorphins! :) And I love the idea of buying one new healthy thing at the store. Adventure is the key to not getting bored with the food routine.
I'll share my herbs (growing lots of sage :)) and veggies with you and I'll help you put together those wonderful garden boxes like I have in my backyard (we talked about this today). Here's a site that gives information regarding how to use your oven to dehydrate tomatoes, but the principles are the same for other veggies as well. And the next time I make my homemade tomato sauce or soup, I'll take pictures so that you can see how I dried the solids. Awesomeness all the way around!
Susan, thanks so much for sharing! I'm genuinely looking forward to growing my own veggies this year. It's so nice to have stuff on hand to play with! lol Will be checking out the site!
So wonderful!! Congratulations to you!
Looking forward to posts about healthy cooking!
Thank you, Kate!
Wonderful, Andi! It's great how switching your focus to healthy foods made all the difference - very inspiring.
Thanks, Belle! And so ridonkulously easy. It's almost like a game at this point -- cutting out the crud and forging my way to the good stuff. :)
Super awesome, Andi, and congrats on the 40 lbs. I know how amazing that feels as I've lost a similar amount of weight since leaving my job from hell a 1.5 years ago. I didn't make huge drastic changes either or follow any kind of fad diet - just stopped drinking my calories, cut out a bunch of fast food eating, and tried to only eat when I was hungry as well. Looking forward to reading more about your journey!
Thanks, Brooke! Amazing how the job/stress can take a toll, eh?? I'm actually surprised I lost instead of gained at my old (hell) job. I think I was too busy to eat much of the time (not good!). I have also made an effort to cut out fast food, though I've slipped a little since I'm getting back into a work routine. Even when I eat out, though, I think I make better choices and that's really important to this working.
That is awesome … and I think the way you looked at eating more healthy food rather than dieting may be the mental key to doing this!
Definitely the key for me, Jenners! :)
What a wonderful post, Andi. Congrats. Thanks for sharing this with us. I'm looking forward to reading more about your journey.
Thank you, Natasha! Cheers to more fun healthy posts! ;)
Yay you! That's always the problem with "dieting" -- it's restrictive and it implies that it has an end. Being more healthy, eating more healthfully, and learning about yourself are ongoing, satisfying, and positive. I can't wait to read more.
Thanks, Candace! It is definitely restrictive and does not lend itself to a lifestyle change.
Congrats on your weight loss journey!!
Thanks, Kelly! :D
If you were here I would give you a giant hug. Way to go, Andi! And guess what? I did the same thing last year. I made small changes (eating lots of fruits and veggies every day, getting more exercise, eating sweets and goodies in moderation, drinking plenty of water, etc) a bit at a time, and now they're practically habit. My weight loss has happened slowly (it was months before anyone actually noticed) but so far it's stayed off, which is the important thing. And I feel better, too! I never really noticed before how lousy bad food made me feel.
Thanks so much for sharing this, Andi! I'm proud of you :)
Awww, thank you, Emily! Good for you for doing the same!!! And yes, staying off is the key. I gained about 3-4 pounds over the holidays, but I'm back to my good habits and they've fallen right back off. It's so much easier when it's a life change and not a "diet." :)
It's wonderful that you have made the changes in your life to eat healthier. It shows that even one change, in resolving to eat healthier food, can make a big difference. Can't wait to read some of your tips over the next few weeks.
It makes a HUGE change, Janel. And it feels good -- like a new challenge. :)
How wonderful that you've been making these small changes for the better! Hope you have a healthy and happy 2013!
Thank you, Cecelia! :)
I read this on Friday afternoon but then didn't open up my computer at all this weekend. I just wanted to tell you again how awesome I think that this is and how awesome I think that you are. For some reason working out comes more easily to me than watching what I eat but I do try to be mindful and make sure that the good outweighs the bad. It's easy to get caught up in numbers but it's amazing what we learn when we just stop and listen to how our body feels and the cues it is putting off. Can't wait to read more and to continue to celebrate this journey with you.
Thank you so much, Trish! I never realized the importance of the natural cues. I was trying to FORCE myself into a new, unnatural routine, and it just never ever worked. :D
You're awesome, Andi! You make an excellent point here: when you focus on health instead of weight loss, the transition is so much smoother. I'm actually getting ready to start Weight Watchers in an attempt to get control of my habits and health, and I hope I enjoy some of your success!
Isn't it, Meg? I hope you have good luck with Weight Watchers and that it's a good fit for you. I tried some websites and stuff to help me in the past, but it just felt like one more obligation. Ultimately it worked for me to just be more laid back and intuitive about the whole thing. Looking forward to hopefully hearing more from you on your experience. :)
Well done, that is awesome! I really need to lose weight but I eat far too much crap for it to happen.
You've inspired me to get serious about my workouts, Andi. I'm on my feet all day and use that as an excuse to skip the treadmill after work. And it's time to getting moving and start eating healthier meals. Time to give up that second glass of wine, too!
Love the new look of your blog background, and I know you yourself look lovely as well. I naturally crave the things that are bad for you, being raised in only the things that are good for you I've tended to over indulge the processed things. But, you're right of course. Eating good things, in small amount, works. Like my mother who has three lettuce leaves on a rice cracker and calls it lunch. No wonder she's a size two!
Forgot to mention that falling madly in love is also a great diet plan. Twenty pounds gone last time that happened to me.
I'm so thrilled for you! I'm trying to get back to being really mindful of how much I'm eating after having my son last year. Hopefully I'll be able to start exercising; that seems to help me keep my hunger under control for some reason.

Title
Land Information Sensor Web
This project will develop a prototype Land Information Sensor Web by integrating the Land Information System (LIS) in a sensor web framework will allow for optimal 2-way information flow that enhances land surface modeling using sensor web observations, and in turn allows sensor web reconfiguration to minimize overall system uncertainty. Through continuous automatic calibration techniques and data assimilation methods, LIS will enable on-the-fly sensor web reconfiguration to optimize the changing needs of science and solutions. This prototype will be based on a simulated interactive sensor web, which is then used to exercise and optimize the sensor web modeling interfaces. These synthetic experiments provide a controlled environment in which to examine the end-to-end performance of the prototype, and examine the impact of various design sensor web design trade-offs and the eventual value of sensor webs for particular prediction or decision support. In addition to providing critical Information for sensor web design considerations, this prototype would establish legacy for operational sensor web integration with modeling systems. Though the stand-alone LIS has achieved a TRL of 8, we determine our entry TRL to be 4 as other components are to be implemented and tested. This project will deliver an interoperable TRL 6 plug-and-play components based on LIS that enable data ingest and scientific analysis, the generation of new sensor web data products, connections to major spacecraft schedulers and task managers, metadata transformation and exchange, and data fusion techniques. This project directly addresses topic area 3: Enabling model interactions with sensor webs, and is expected to have a 3-year performance period starting from October 2006.

Startup formula for becoming an overnight success: Work hard. Get Lucky. Ride the Wave and then make sure to smile for the camera.
I got an email the other day from a CEO at a company I advise who had applied for a startup accelerator called Impact Engine. The news in the email was not good. She had reached the last round of judging but didn’t make the final cut.
My advice to her was: don’t worry about. As a startup founder, there is so much that is outside of your control, that all you can really do is continue to work your tail off and hope to catch a few lucky breaks along the way.
Here’s an example.
In 2009, I fell in love with a venture capital firm called First Round Capital. A tweet from one of their associates had led me to a blog post, which led me to their website, which led me to their holiday card video. If there is such thing as love at first sight with a venture capital firm, this was it. ”OMG,” I thought to myself after I watched the video, ”These guys are as weird as I am.”
So I decided to email them. It was the first venture capital firm I had ever reached out to and I had absolutely zero clue as to what I was doing. I wrote a stupidly long and wordy email telling them about GiveForward and asked for the opportunity to pitch. Within a day I got a very thoughtful response from an associate. He said no and that we’d probably be better off as a non-profit. A year later after graduating from Excelerate Labs, I reached out again to FRC to see if we could pitch and again the same associate said no. This time, he wrote that he appreciated the progress we had made but didn’t see this as a “venture type deal”. Another year passed, and then in April of 2012 I reached out to FRC again. This time, we got a better response. They agreed to hear our pitch and a few weeks later decided to co-lead our round along with Founder Collective. (hooray!)
Now, the funny thing is, last night I got an email out of the blue from the First Round Capital VC who I had written to all the way back in 2009 and 2010. I hadn’t spoken to him in two years and he has since moved on from First Round Capital to start his own VC firm. His email consisted of only one word. It said:
Congrats :)
Moral of the story. In life and in startups, if you believe in what you’re doing, just keep doing it and with a little luck, eventually someone is going to notice.
I think this is particularly true with raising capital. As a first time entrepreneur, when you go to pitch investors you’re going to hear NO a lot more than you hear YES. When we did our angel round with GiveForward in 2011 we ended up oversubscribed, meaning that more people wanted to invest than we had room for in the round. Even so, the NO’s outnumbered the YES’s nearly two to one. (we pitched 45 investors. 16 said yes. 29 said no. 13 participated in the round). With our most recent round of funding that closed this past July, we ended up oversubscribed again. But we still heard NO eight times before we heard our first YES. NO’s are the default answer in the VC world. Rejection is part of the game. It doesn’t mean your idea is bad. It might just mean that your idea doesn’t fit within a firm’s investment thesis or the timing is bad for the firm or that your concept is “too early” and the market isn’t ready for it yet.
When I look back at GiveForward in 2009, we definitely fit into this last category of being “too early”. And to be honest, if I was First Round Capital, I probably wouldn’t have invested in us back then either.
Here’s what the landscape looked like in 2009:
- GiveForward, Kickstarter, and maybe three or four other crowdfunding sites exist; none of which have really taken off yet.
- Facebook, the main platform people use to share their crowdfunding pages, has a ‘paltry’ 200 million users
- The term crowdfunding is largely unknown. Most people in the industry were still referring to the space as “peer to peer fundraising”
Here’s what it looks like in 2012
- There are over 300 crowdfunding sites worldwide; Kickstarter has become a household name.
- Facebook now has about a 1 billion users worldwide sharing crowdfunding pages millions of times a day.
- The term crowdfunding has not only been popularized by the general public but President Obama has even passed a crowdfunding law called the JOBS Act with near unanimous support from Congress.
What a difference three years makes, right? GiveForward isn’t a fundamentally different company than we were in 2009, but in 2012 the public is now comfortable enough with the concept of crowdfunding to make market adoption a real possibility. And truth be told, we got really lucky with our market timing. Although we were a little early when we launched in 2008, we bootstrapped and stayed in the game long enough to be in the right place at the right time. In 2010 Kickstarter got funding from Union Square Ventures, putting crowdfunding on the VC map (thank you Fred Wilson). By 2011, Kickstarter had blown up and crowdfunding had officially arrived. And now in 2012…well, now everyone who got into crowdfunding early is just riding the wave and hopefully looking good when we smile for the camera.
I enjoyed reading this. Your last one was pretty good too!
Great post, and CONGRATS on the round ! you have a great vision, great product, great team, and not more great investors. Great opportunity !

A Study of Academic and Professional Qualification on Teachers' Job Effectiveness in Nigerian Secondary Schools
Doctoral dissertation, December 2006.
University of Helsinki, Faculty of Behavioural Sciences, Department of Applied Sciences of Education.
This academic work begins with a compact presentation of the general background to the study, which also includes an autobiography for the interest in this research. The presentation provides readers who know little of the topic of this research and of the structure of the educational system as well as of the value given to education in Nigeria. It further concentrates on the dynamic interplay of the effect of academic and professional qualification and teachers' job effectiveness in secondary schools in Nigeria in particular, and in Africa in general. The aim of this study is to produce a systematic analysis and rich theoretical and empirical description of teachers' teaching competencies. The theoretical part comprises a comprehensive literature review that focuses on research conducted in the areas of academic and professional qualification and teachers' job effectiveness, teaching competencies, and the role of teacher education with particular emphasis on school effectiveness and improvement. This research benefits greatly from the functionalist conception of education, which is built upon two emphases: the application of the scientific method to the objective social world, and the use of an analogy between the individual 'organism' and 'society'. To this end, it offers us an opportunity to define terms systematically and to view problems as always being interrelated with other components of society. The empirical part involves describing and interpreting what educational objectives can be achieved with the help of teachers' teaching competencies in close connection to educational planning, teacher training and development, and achieving them without waste.
The data used in this study were collected between 2002 and 2003 from teachers, principals, supervisors of education from the Ministry of Education and Post Primary Schools Board in the Rivers State of Nigeria (N=300). The data were collected from interviews, documents, observation, and questionnaires and were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods to strengthen the validity of the findings. The data collected were analyzed to answer the specific research questions and hypotheses posited in this study. The data analysis involved the use of multiple statistical procedures: Percentages Mean Point Value, T-test of Significance, One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Cross Tabulation. The results obtained from the data analysis show that teachers require professional knowledge and professional teaching skills, as well as a broad base of general knowledge (e.g., morality, service, cultural capital, institutional survey). Above all, in order to carry out instructional processes effectively, teachers should be both academically and professionally trained. This study revealed that teachers are not however expected to have an extraordinary memory, but rather looked upon as persons capable of thinking in the right direction.
This study may provide a solution to the problem of teacher education and school effectiveness in Nigeria. For this reason, I offer this treatise to anyone seriously committed in improving schools in developing countries in general and in Nigeria in particular to improve the lives of all its citizens. In particular, I write this to encourage educational planners, education policy makers, curriculum developers, principals, teachers, and students of education interested in empirical information and methods to conceptualize the issue this study has raised and to provide them with useful suggestions to help them improve secondary schooling in Nigeria. Though, multiple audiences exist for any text. For this reason, I trust that the academic community will find this piece of work a useful addition to the existing literature on school effectiveness and school improvement. Through integrating concepts from a number of disciplines, I aim to describe as holistic a representation as space could allow of the components of school effectiveness and quality improvement.
A new perspective on teachers' professional competencies, which not only take into consideration the unique characteristics of the variables used in this study, but also recommend their environmental and cultural derivation. In addition, researchers should focus their attention on the ways in which both professional and non-professional teachers construct and apply their methodological competencies, such as their grouping procedures and behaviors to the schooling of students.
Keywords: Professional Training, Academic Training, Professionally Qualified, Academically Qualified, Professional Qualification, Academic Qualification, Job Effectiveness, Job Efficiency, Educational Planning, Teacher Training and Development, Nigeria.

. How could anyone feel that this vintage shop had ANY sort of credibility from a listing like this?!
These shoes were probably pre-owned by Shauna Sands and that is why they are now “vintage”. Disgraceful!
Sidenote: Why would you want to be orange and have an anchor on your foot?.
Is this seller for real? When they list a retail value and their cost, it makes me pause. This is their Etsy site and ring their “collective” made:
Here is their website and the same ring:

Reader comment:
craftlittlethings is a blatant reseller! She claims she is the designer of the wedding dresses on her website, if you read all of the wedding dress listings – she says she’ll make it in a regular standard size, but if you want it altered, you have to take it to a tailor to have it altered. If you are making it why can’t you make it to fit?
Most of “HER” dresses can be found on the website below – too many to list them all. BY the way, I convo’d her, she told me she is the designer and handmade the dresses you see in the photos, she makes a ton of them and says she is back ordered that I better hurry up and order it now – (but wouldn’t give me a straight answer on why she can’t do custom) and she works for a bridal boutique (how convienent).
her 100% handmade dress that SHE designed
the shop in China that actually makes the dress
Also she loves to resell clutches
hers
online (various sellers)
pretty much everything in her store is NOT handmade by her- (possibly the 3 bridesmaid /prom dresses may be made by her) but the wedding dresses NOT!

Is there something about the paranormal you would like to see in an article? Whether it is something from within the paranormal community or of the unexplained it could be viable as an article. Contact the author with your idea and it may be the next topic of discussion.
<|endofexample|>
There are some things that I find it impossible to do if I think about the fact that I’m doing them.
Usually they’re things that involve some kind of muscle memory. When I was skiing all the time there were days where I felt transformed, like I was flying and I was completely present and in the moment, in that zone – unless I started to think about what I was physically doing.
Getting to the point where skiing was fun meant that I had to endure a few seasons where I was awkward, frequently frustrated and often terrified. I had to get past that learning curve so I could finally enjoy the sensation of that controlled fall through space.
Writing feels that way: reason #8,752 for writing often, even when the writing sucks.
A couple of things that flitted into my consciousness over the last couple of days scared me a little. I read some blog posts that focused on specific craft ideas. It wasn’t new information. It was the kind stuff I’ve read about many times and yet when I thought about how or if I was using these techniques, I came up blank.
I don’t know.
Yet?
The reason I was scared was because I realized that the snippets of work I might feel bold enough to think have the potential to be good are the snippets that come to me when I’m in the zone. As soon as I become conscious of using words to a certain effect, it becomes obvious and the work feels contrived.When I revise, I become more aware of sharpening certain images or ideas to reinforce what I’m trying to convey. I know that when others critique my work, they sometimes point out the effectiveness (or not) of something I’ve done and I’ll realize they’re right even though I didn’t consciously include that word or that image or that description. Oh yeah, I meant to do that.
I have a theory that the reason that Scott’s new abstract work feels so powerful is because a good abstract painting requires that the painter have a mastery of all the skills needed to do a traditional, representational painting, only he has to intuit his way through the abstract. He knows if the color harmonies are correct and if the composition is balanced because he has an innate understanding of those concepts.
If we have an underlying appreciation of the visual arts, we know the painting works when we look at it, but we don’t know why.
Books on writing craft don’t talk much about the importance of years of experience in writing, but perhaps there’s a reason for that. We want things that give us results now and there’s no shortcut to practice and experience. Perhaps it would help us to set more realistic expectations and motivate us to write more and work harder to get good at what we do if we thought of writing as a long apprenticeship. Actually, that's helpful to me, but I know it's not the path for everyone.
There are plenty of people who can write well enough to get a book published, and if that’s the writer’s goal, there’s nothing wrong with that.
I’m talking about writing well. I’m talking about my vain wish to have a reader touched by my words or to have a reader thinking about my characters even when he’s not reading the book. I’m talking about a reader losing himself in the work and entering John Gardner’s fictive dream. I keep remembering a scene from the movie, Amadeus and a monologue that the Salieri character delivers:
.”
My aspirations aren’t quite so grand, but I can confess to a fantasy where someone, somewhere writes a review of something I’ve written and confers some kind of literary approval on it.
When I attended Carleen Brice’s book launch party for her debut novel, Orange Mint and Honey she talked about writing the book over a period of six years and she talked about completely rewriting it multiple times. I was truly comforted to learn this. I had a secret fear that good books might come pouring out of other writers at a speed and a rate that I know myself quite incapable of.
While blogging has far more advantages than disadvantages in the form of creating community, the public nature of our efforts creates a small disadvantage.
When will you finish it? When will it be published? I sense from well meaning friends a certain impatience and maybe even disappointment that I don’t move more quickly. I think about The Foundling Wheel, my Dickens Challenge work in progress and I know that my goal is to finish it. For now, that’s my only goal. I don’t know if I’ll want to rewrite and revise and edit it once I come to the end. I don’t know if that’s its purpose. I know the project is teaching me a lot about writing, but I don’t know if it’s my first book.When I say that my eventual goal is to publish a novel, I mean it. Eventually. I don't know when. I don’t know which novel that might be. I don’t know if it’s the one I’m working on, one of the two I’ve set aside or one I don’t know about yet. I just know I’ll know it when it comes to me. Maybe I’m too idealistic. Maybe this means I’m not a real writer, whatever that is.
Sometimes the lack of validation feeds the self-doubt that I and all of us have from time to time – but I also suspect that self-doubt never goes away no matter how much external validation we get about our writing. The blogging community gives me enormous validation about my emotions and about the process. For that reason, I keep coming back. I think that eventually, the only true validation about the worth of our own writing has to come from ourselves.
I once read an interview with Frank Conroy about the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. The interviewer asked him if he could tell which of the writers would go on to be published and which would be successful. He said he couldn’t. Talent and potential have very little bearing on whether or not a writer can go on to finish and publish a successful book.
As time goes on, I am learning to trust myself. I feel a huge learning curve still ahead of me and I’m at peace with that. It’s my path and no one else’s. It doesn’t frustrate me. I’m in no hurry. I’ll write what I’m meant to write and learn as I’m meant to learn.
Does my lack of a sense of urgency reflect a lack of drive or of passion? I don’t think so. In the seventies, Paul Masson’s famous advertisement coined the phrase, “We’ll sell no wine before its time”.
I feel that way about my writing. It’s not time. I’ve often heard writers talk about how much bad fiction is published and how often they’ve read books and known they could write better. All true, but that’s not what drives me. I confess, I want to write something good and only time and more and still more writing will tell me if I can.
But that’s just me. Maybe I’m crazy. Maybe my expectations are too high.
For those of you both published and unpublished, how important is it to you that your work be perceived as good? Is it enough to provide your readers with escape and entertainment? Can you recognize your own shortcomings due to inexperience, or trace a path from inexperience to a gradual or sudden improvement?
Why are you writing that book?
31 comments:
This post confirmed what I've always known about you, Lisa. You're a true artist who seeks to present whatever you do in the best possible light. And though your canvases are paper and/or a monitor screen, your words are the colors that offer us lingering visual imagery of truthful beauty along with food for thought.
In other words, the masterpiece will appear someday...I know that too.
Your comment on painting reminded me of a visit some years ago to a garage sale. An older man was in charge and the song "Laura" was playing on a boom box. I mentioned that I always thought of the Spike Jones parody version of the song. He said he had actually seen Spike play, and he was amazed at the fact that Spike and his City Slickers were all topnotch musicians. Even a good parody requires a good understanding of the music he's making fun of.
I'm also reminded of Jack Kerouac's "On the Road." Though he famously wrote it on a roll of paper so he didn't have to stop to insert pages in his typewriter, he actually did a lot of revising after that initial burst of energy.
And Kerouac had written a more conventional novel, "The Town and the City," before "On the Road," so like Scott, he had mastered the basic form.
Your Dickens Challenge novel, like mine, is really a first draft, but it has more than a spark of brilliance.
As to why I'm writing that book, I'm not really sure. I wanted to write something that tied in the idealism of my generation to the spiritual world and also celebrates nonviolence. I'd like to sell it, and I fantasize about being interviewed by Terry Gross, Diane Rehm, Melissa Block, and Scott Simon (yeah, I'm an NPR junkie). But I'm also somehow driven to write it, and I'm thankful for Tim Hallinan for giving me the structure to write it and for people like you, Julie, Szelsofa, Charles, Cindy, and Usman for encouraging me.
What a great post! First of all, when I read your Dickens Challenge Chapters, I am back in the 80s, in the barracks, or out at the club surrounded by my friends. Note that I didn't say I'm "reminded of when I was there." I said, "I'm there." In addition, I've been worried about this baby since before she was born and pacing the floor waiting for her arrival. I was so relieved when Tracy nabbed her, I shouted with joy!
What do I think about writing? I read constantly. The commercial fiction gives me hope that one day I'll be published, too. The literary fiction I read gives me a reason to keep working, keep practicing, keep revising, keep trying to improve.
The encouragement I get from readers is exhilarating, intoxicating, and addicting. But it's effect dissipates. Then all I'm left with is what I wrote. In the end, I have to be happy with my writing, because "fans" will eventually close the book and go home.
The encouragement I receive from readers who write (yourself, Tim, the other Challengers) I tend to take to heart more than positive comments from people who love me (and feel obligated to say nice things to me.)
I think my doubts are similar to your doubts and my hopes are similar to your hopes.
Don't give up! I can't wait to see what's coming next (but of course, I'll wait til you're ready to post!)
Lisa... you ask such damned good questions.
What's considered "good" is subjective, yes? Besides, as a genre writer, I've already got many in the literary world looking down their noses at me without ever having read a word.
Understanding all of this, I'm more concerned with writing salable books with which I can sustain a living. I'll let someone else write the Great American Novel. Me? I'd rather write what the teeming millions are reading on airplanes and commuter trains. (Who am I kidding? I'd be happy with teeming hundreds... as long as they're reading!)
Then again, my day job's a different world of writing... one where I deal with tight schedules that can't wait for me to find my muse, or labor over whether a color is azure or cobalt or just simply blue. I routinely turn out two or three 20k- to 55k-word books every three or four months. That means I've gotta get to the nut of "the story" in a hurry.
If I don't, I'm holding up business.
That was a raw post you wrote there. I was amazed and reassured to read about your insecurities as well as your ambition, and quiet confidence, all mixed in together. It amazes me how I can feel driven, yet anxiuos, at the same time. I don't want to be accepted by the masses, that's not my aim. I'm not totally happy with what I'm creating at the moment, but I know I have to continue creating. And I can 'feel' when what I've done is good. It's so hard not to over-think what you're doing when you're creating, and second guess each move. Why do we put ourselves through this? Then again, I can't living without the need to create something.
What a fantastic post.
I think there is a place for all kinds of writers and writing. It's just a matter of finding "your" path -- which it sounds like you're doing.
I have an enormous respect for genre writers who can crank it out (Rob!) and I've tried that myself (my NaNo novel was chick-lit). But at the end of the day I actually don't think I have much of a choice in what kind of writer I am or what I feel drawn to write. So I feel like you do, I'm on the path for as long as it takes.
Wonderful questions, Lisa--thoughtful, honest, and real. I can say that I think we see writing through a similar lens. My best writing comes when I'm not thinking about it--when I am in that zone and it flows through me and onto the paper. The characters take over. And I don't want to just write a book. I want to write something readers connect with. I don't kid myself and think it's great literature, but I have been so gratified to hear from readers who tell me, yes, that's it, that's how I'd feel, or, perhaps the best comment, "I feel understood" from a mom who had lost a child.
I like to think I'm writing more than what I call "vacation books"--the kind of books you just leave by the pool when you're done--it was an escape but nothing more.
Now that I'm starting my 3rd book, I'm going to try something new with my blog--I'm going to post about my process at least once a week--how I'm writing it start to finish. We'll see what I uncover about how I write.
For those of you both published and unpublished, how important is it to you that your work be perceived as good?
The only validation I seek is from a magazine editor or publisher's acceptance for publication.
Good reviews? Fan letters? Pats on the back? Respect from my peers? Nice, but don't need 'em or seek 'em.
Is it enough to provide your readers with escape and entertainment?
Yup. I have no illusion that I'm creating art or changing the world. My job is to entertain, that's it.
Can you recognize your own shortcomings due to inexperience, or trace a path from inexperience to a gradual or sudden improvement?
Totally. After 20 years I've developed what I think is the most important trait of all: the ability to self-edit, to look at the work with a cold, cruel eye and eliminate what's not working.
Doesn't mean I don't want or need outside editorial comment, just that I recognize that I'm creating a product, and for that product to sell it has to be at a certain level of craft and professionalism.
Did I have that ability when I started out, or even five years ago? Nope.
Why are you writing that book?
Money. Pure and simple.
Lisa: Whether your at the start or height of the learning curve as a writer, no matter what, you've got to finish every novel. I think one reason people don't is that they start writing as soon as they get a half-baked idea and then fizzle out because they just haven't thought it through.
I liked your "we will sell no wine" quote (I'm old enough to remember Orson Welles in those ads) - whether it's having the story fully formed in your head before you write, or submitting a polished and edited MS to an agent, I think patience is the ritual a writer can practice.
Larramie, You are the most supportive blog pal a writer could have. Thank you.
Steve, I didn't know that about Jack Kerouac, and your anecdote serves to reinforce my thought that even (and maybe especially) people who are doing things out there on the fringes of experimental fiction had to learn the basics of craft/the rules, before going on to break the rules. Aristotle was on to something.
You're on to something with Things Done and Left Undone and I am confident you'll succeed with it. You're doing something I've personally never seen before and it's wonderful.
I love the idea of the NPR interviews and like you, I will be eternally grateful to Tim and our DC readers and writers. I think the DC has broken something loose for me too. Thank you for always reading and for your thoughtful and very kind comments.
Cindy, You have a great approach and a great attitude and your writing is incredibly clean and polished, even in first draft form. I feel exactly the same way that you do about outside encouragement. I take it all in stride, but in the end, it's me that I have to please. Thanks for always reading and commenting. It helps a lot and don't worry. I'm never giving up. :)
Rob, I don't think genre gets far more respect than many genre writers perceive. There are masters writing in all areas and my theory is that since academics and literary scholars tend to make up the critical community, we only see serious reviews of the work they gravitate toward. It would not surprise me to see literary criticism branch out at some point so that individual genres get more critical attention and the good, the bad and the ugly in each are more clearly distinguished.
Writing for income is a perfectly honorable purpose. In fact, I think that it's important that all writers can be honest with themselves about goals since the reason we write must dictate how we approach our craft.
It's all about business for the publishers and none of us can ever forget that.
Yellow, I feel pretty comfortable in revealing myself here. The pursuit of any kind of art is an incredibly difficult thing and I think it's important to constantly revisit and analyze our motivations and our goals, as well as our insecurities (so that we can figure out how to lessen them) and finally, our expectations. The path to all pursuits in life is much more difficult and heartbreaking is we don't have realistic expectations. My insecurities lessen every day as I accept my limitations and work toward understanding and overcoming them and as I learn to trust my own ability to judge my work. I think you answered your own question. "Why do we put ourselves through this?", because we can't not. Keep painting. Scott and I enjoy checking in on you and watching you grow.
Yogamum, I believe you're right. I think the thing that has alleviated much of my anxiety is recognizing that each of us has her own path and with the help of, or in spite of outside input, we simply need to stay on that path.
I also admire any writer who can consistently write salable work and in particular, those who are able to make a living doing it. I'm pretty sure that's not in the cards for me, but I'm content with where I'm going.
Judy, Yes, I do think we have very similar goals. It's that desire to connect through words that's most important to me.
I'm excited about your plans to post about process. You and Carleen both seem to have taken a similar length of time to write your first novels and have subsequently followed up with second novels in a much more compressed time line. Of course, I think you were both able to also segue to writing full time after novel number one, which certainly had to help, but I think your posts on the process of writing novel number three will been fascinating.
Josephine, I have no doubt that you are on the cusp of becoming a very successful writer. You know exactly what you want and you've worked to figure out exactly what your path must be to get there.
Great insight on the reasons people leave so many novels unfinished and I think you're exactly right. I put my first two attempts aside because I really didn't have a clear idea of where I was going with them. I started with a premise for the one I'm working on now, so even though it's unclear to me right now exactly how it will end, I had much more concrete ideas about where I was going with it than I did with the others and I think it's because those other experiences taught me a lot about what the bones of the story had to have.
I'm also glad to have summoned the ghost of Orson Welles for you! As I observe the world and read the agent blogs, I can't help but believe that far too many writers are sending out half-baked work. This journey will be extremely unpleasant and unsatisfying for those without the patience to revise, edit and polish and without the proper expectations about the industry.
For Rob -- I meant to say that I think I think genre gets MORE respect than people perceive.
And I meant to also tell you that all these months later, your MC and the female character (I forget her name) have very much stayed with me. I've always loved that she smells like nail polish and cookie dough and has a penchant for retro in her fashion sense and decorating sense, and there were expressions you used about the bad guys and the MC's mom not knowing her like he did that have really stuck. I read a LOT and that so much of what I read in your manuscript stayed with me speaks volumes.
I don't believe the self doubt ever leaves you. I'm still attacked by it at times, sometimes even to the point of near paralysis. But at times when I've stopped for a while writing I can't stay away.
It is most important that people read my stuff and are entertained. I believe if they are entertained they may began to be sympathetic to my messages about life, but the most important point it to touch someone.
Your post: powerful and moving.
Your doubts and fears: normal and human.
My goals: tell as many stories to as many people as possible before I die.
Critics, etc: I guess I have my hands full trying to tell the story. I'm happy to let those who hear it decide how they feel.
Thanks again for that post - wonderful!
Charles, I'm coming to believe that if we weren't plagued by doubt about writing, something else would take its place. I think it must just be part of who we are -- people driven toward creative pursuits.
Making that connection -- I think no matter what we believe our purpose is, that's at the core of it somewhere.
Steve M, What a fabulous goal. I'd never considered the aspect of telling many stories, but your comment has made me think about how many stories we all have within us. Perhaps it's a good thing for me to keep in mind -- that despite the enormity (at least in my mind) of the novel -- that it's only one story. There are so many more.
Lisa, let me add to the chorus. Great Post.
It has me thinking and about so many things, the zone, isecurities, wishes and so much more.
I'll have to end up reading it again.
For me writing is art. I haven't mastered it, but hope to one day. I want to be published, at the same time I want to be remembered for writing something good.
Amadeus is absolutely my favorite movie. The part where Salieri says the words you wrote; that was a great part of the movie.
Fascinating post.
Love the analogy with the skiing, and also with art.
Guess its a truism that a writer is a person who writes. A writer is also primarily a person who thinks - and thinks through what they are saying (in a subconscious zone sense if need be.)So there's a Primary need for 'awareness' in good writing....?
"Talent and potential have very little bearing on whether or not a writer can go on to finish and publish a successful book."
Man, this could be tweaked and used for every goal one has in life. I have often told Boy that while talent plays a part, determination plays the larger role in getting what you want.
you have articulated all that has been running through my brain lately. TO do the good work. To be happy with the end result regardless of the time.
to answer the question of why, for me it is simple: i am compelled to get the stories down. they demand a page and their voice. but, to get it right is the tortuous act...
it's like running. just start and even though towards the end you think you have no more to give, somehow you make it home.
or maybe it's not anything like running...
I really enjoyed this post and think you have a really sensible attitude toward writing. I guess it's nice to get a big paycheck, but I have always been content to take my time and get published by small presses. At least someone is reading the novels and poems.
I also like what you said about books on writing. I am not a big believer in such books to begin with since, as you point out, the only real way to learn how to write, imho, is to read a lot and write a lot. (It's what Stephen King said in ON WRITING.) I take all the other advice with a grain of salt.
The one exception is Ray Bradbury's Zen in the Art of Writing. It's a marvelous book, filled with a more practical "sit down and don't overthink what you're doing to the point where it becomes agony." His premise is that when you relax, the words begin to flow.
You have a lovely site. I'd like to link your site to my Chapter and Verse blog if that's okay.
Another one for the TBR pile from Billy. Gotta love Mr. Bradbury.
SO MUCH to read and think and write about on this topic, Lisa. All I know: I read your first ten chapters Friday morning while en route to Boston and almost called you to cheer you on! Can't wait to read more. I'll be happy to offer more details along the way but for now just keep plugging for the love of it; I guarantee your readers will love it too. K.
Usman, I think we're on the same page (pun intended). I love Amadeus too! I think there are a million lines in that movie that are brilliant and sometimes I quote them and people have no idea what I'm talking about so they think I'm nuts. I suppose I am. :)
Julie, More excellent food for thought. Thank you.
Patti, I think just about anything is achievable with enough hard work and persistence. And actually I think your running analogy works very well, especially when thinking about novel writing, which many have compared to a marathon that requires a lot of endurance.
Bill, I am so glad you stopped in! I have been enjoying your insights at Charles G's site and keep meaning to check your blog -- which I now have and it is wonderful. I would be honored if you linked to me and I'd like to add Chapter and Verse to my sidebar too.
Thank you for the Ray Bradbury recommendation. It sounds like just what I need to read at this stage.
K, I'm so happy you read past chapter 1! Thank you so much for the encouragement. I was thinking after hearing Carleen's talk that I'll bet the final story has only passing resemblance to what I have so far, but that's probably a very good thing. Maybe when I get back in town later this week we can shoot for having "not coffee" :) Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
What an excellent post! So very thoughtful and well done! I can tell you I have been working on my two different books from the year 2000. While I consider myself a professional writer in the sense that my professional life was all about writing for business and legal reasons, I still feel a rookie when it comes to creative writing. I've been working on it for so many years now, I think I can actually see improvement. My first attempts were pitiful. Now, I can see how much better I've become, and yet I am still not there yet.
Ello, I know what you mean about professional writing and fiction writing. Of course I'm in sales so some might say that my professional writing might occasionally border on fiction :) But it doesn't! I feel very much like a rookie, but if I go back and look at things I've written even three months ago, I feel like I'm getting better. Lately I have it in my head that if I learned a bit about poetry, perhaps my prose might become a bit more...lyrical? I'd like that. A seed has been planted.
At the beginning of this century, I started writing a small, funny novel. Twelve thousand words in, life happened to me, and hasn't stopped since. I've never written another word of it, but the story resides - fully-formed - in my frontal lobes. The characters follow me like mute shadows. I think about them all the time, as if they were real people. The question for me is not 'why are you writing that book?', it's 'why did you stop?'.
Orchid Hunter, Why did you stop? Going on eight years -- that's a long time to be followed by these characters. I truly envy you that the story is all there, just waiting to be written. What you've said reminds me of something I read in a book about Woody Allen. He writes very quickly, but before he begins the physical writing he thinks and he takes walks and he thinks some more. By the time he actually begins to write, he's worked the whole thing out. It's all there -- why not start again? Your posts are brilliant and I imagine that any story you've been carrying around with you for that long is one I and many others would love to read. I hope you pick it up again. Maybe this is a sign to YOU.
I loved your post, Lisa, and there's great discussion here in the comments. I'll try and chime in with my two cents.
I thought of this question - why am I writing this book, or rather, why am I writing? - the other night when I sat in bed with a hard copy of my manuscript, taking notes and writing down character changes, etc. I asked myself, "Why am I doing this? What if no one ever reads this? What if it's never published? Do I care?"
And there's a complicated answer. Yes, I care if it doesn't get published because that's my ultimate goal. But if nothing I write ever gets published, well, I don't care - because I'll still write.
I like how you've slowed down in your process - I've done that, too. I HAD to do it - yet I didn't realize it at the time. I was so focused on getting published that I had a hopeless sense of urgency that completely exhausted me. So I stepped back and realized that I needed to refocus on the writing itself. And boy, was it ever the right decision to let go of that monkey on my back, the "you need to get published now, NOW, NOW!" I can't tell you how much better I feel - and I'm definitely enjoying the writing process now. LOVING it, in fact!
So much to think about here, Lisa!
I think your theory is spot on: You can't know how to skillfully bend or break a rule until you understand what happens when you obey it. You can't write a good metafiction until you understand how to write good fiction to begin with.
I think writers often write the kinds of stories they like to read, and the kinds of stories they like to read often determines what the writing and publishing process will be like for them. While I love to read many different genres (and hope to be able to genre-hop once I understand how to tell a good story to begin with), I am drawn primarily to literary fiction, both as reader and writer. I love stories that come packed with ideas and philosophies, so it seems like the logical thing to want to create in this vein. Sometimes I think it's a crazy thing to aspire to, and I feel like a bit of a snob in a way.
I think I may have blogged about this, but one of the things I've always found strange and upsetting is that practically the first question out of someone's mouth when they find out that I write is, "What have you published?" It sort of lets the air out of the conversation. It's difficult for them to understand that publication may be the yardstick of success for some writers, but it's not the yardstick for everyone. Publication is my goal, but I honestly don't see it happening for a long time (except, perhaps, for short stories or essays).
Not too long ago, a friend of mine told me that reading Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet made him realize that he'll probably never be a published literary artist, and I wanted to argue him into having more faith in himself. He says that he doesn't have it in him to devote himself solely to learning the craft of fiction writing; his interests are wide and varied, and he makes his living through business. And he doesn't, I don't think, want to publish for the sake of being published. I think I understand him better for reading your post tonight.
I earn my living through other work, so I don't need to publish for money; that frees me up, I think, to publish when, where, and how I want to. If I ever put my name to a manuscript and sell it, I want it to be the best it can possibly be at that point in time.
This isn't because I'm craving critical or commercial acclaim, although I doubt there's a writer alive who would honestly dismiss these things (or the advantages they provide). A long time ago, I made a vow to myself that I would try to limit competition to myself alone. That's helped me a LOT as I've read manuscripts by other apprentice writers who I know are more skilled than I am, especially when those writers are also friends.
Rejection letters and negative reviews will still sting, I know, but I want to make sure that, when everything's said and done, I can sit back and say that I've improved, I've outwritten myself.
I consider myself an apprentice writer, and I don't see myself dropping that appellation in the next decade or so. I have loads to learn. Sometimes it seems an insurmountable task, but as you say, that's all the more reason to break it down into daily chunks and keep on plugging away, every chance you get. None of us know for sure how far we'll get, because none of us can be certain that we won't get hit by a bus tomorrow (sorry to be completely morbid, but you know what I'm saying). And so the only thing to do is write, and then keep writing.
Melissa, It is a complicated answer for me too. I do want to be published but only when I've written what I think is the best book that I possibly can and I know I'm not there yet. And you're right, once I had more clarity on what I truly wanted to accomplish, my anxiety level went down and the writing became much more fun -- er, maybe fun isn't exactly the right word, but it feels more natural and comfortable. Maybe that means I'm starting to find my voice.
Jennifer, Okay -- you need to get out of my head immediately :) I'm drawn primarily to literary fiction too and I find myself admitting it as if it's a bit shameful for some reason. Maybe I feel like people perceive my taste as snobby -- but I guess I can't worry about that. I love those books too and I've just finished one by J.M. Coetzee and one by Martin Amis and the skill they have makes me both incredibly awed that human beings are capable of such things and rather than make me frustrated, it steels my resolve. I know I'll never write like they do, but I also know there is a groove for me and eventually I'll discover it.
I've called what I'm doing alternately my DIY MFA program and my apprenticeship, but I'm actually pretty happy with where I am right now and I'm content with my journey.
In my business life, (sales) I found a book a year or two that encapsulated some of the frustration of working in a start-up environment. It's called HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY. I was so taken by its message (mostly because it confirmed all of my ideas -- does that make me a narcissist? If not, something arrogant I'm sure), but it applies to every goal in life.
Hope, for me is something to cling to in desperate times. It can't be an integral component for reaching a goal. Plugging away is part of the plan. Reading and reading and writing and learning from others are all part of that.
I find incredible peace with knowing I'm doing the best I can. So glad to hear from you on this!
Excellent post.
The first draft is when I lose myself in the story. The second and subsequent drafts are about applying the craft.
I believe writing is like a muscle. If you don't use it regularly, you lose strength.
Unfortunately, in this day and age being published and being a good writer are not always the same thing. We strive to do the best we can with each book and then apply the business knowledge we accumulate along the way.
More and more, authors are now expected to churn out 2, 3 books a year instead of one, to fill the publisher's coffers. AND handle all the other promotional tasks publishers can no longer be bothered to handle, dumping it all on the author's shoulders.
Regarding painting -- I use gazing at paintings as fuel for my writing. It refreshes me when I'm tired. Also, the book LIFE, PAINT, AND PASSION was more relevant to my writing than most books on the craft of writing.
Regarding those who doubt you, are disappointed that you don't publish "fast" enough for them -- I've instituted a zero tolerance policy. I ask, "How much have you published?" Answer: "Nothing".
Me: "How much do you know about how the publishing business works?" Answer: "Nothing". ME: "Then shut up until you do."
They can throw crap at you, but you can always step back and let it land on the ground instead of on you.
Devon,
Thank you so much for visiting and commenting. You've offered some very wise advice and insight that will stay with me. I'll have to check out LIFE, PAINT, AND PASSION (ZEN IN THE ART OF WRITING -- Billy's recommendation -- just arrived today). You've got a great blog -- hope you don't mind if I add you to my sidebar. And I'll definitely let the crap land on the ground :)
I read Zen in the Art of Writing about six years ago, and I remember it being one of the most unique books on the subject I'd read thus far. (Time for a re-read, because I can't remember much except one exercise that I use quite a lot.)
"DIY MFA"--I like that!
It's definitely a process, isn't it? And one that I really think is best when it's tailored for the individual writer. I'm fairly certain that an MFA program would have made me want to give up on writing had I enrolled in one when I first started this apprenticeship thing.
I will have to check out Hope Is Not a Strategy. Thanks!
I never set out to write award-winning fiction; my original goal was to be a professional novelist, i.e. writing full-time for a living wage.
That goal was altered, a little, by my time in grad school--and by reading John Gardner especially. The more fiction I wrote, the more I recognized what I was capable of. I couldn't write purely commercial fiction because it didn't satisfy me personally. The challenge, then, was to find my niche.
I want readers to rate my work highly--so I aspire to write at the top of the genre of my reading roots (women's fiction). I think I could write literary fiction, but not as well as the best of 'em, and certainly not quickly enough to make a living from it (IF I could publish it at all).
So yeah, for you I say "just keep writing." I have no doubt you will uncover all the answers you're looking for in the process.
Simple, right? :)

MEMO/11/898
Brussels, 12 December 2011
EU Economic governance "Six-Pack" enters into force. This change represents the most comprehensive reinforcement of economic governance in the EU and the euro area since the launch of the Economic Monetary Union almost 20 years ago. In line with 8-9 December European Summit agreements, the legislative package already brings a concrete and decisive step towards ensuring fiscal discipline, helping to stabilise the EU economy and preventing a new crisis in the EU.
The economic and financial crisis exacerbated the pressure on the public finances of EU Member States. Today,. Member States currently in excessive deficit procedure must comply with the recommendations and deadlines decided by the EU Council to correct their excessive deficit.
The European Parliament and the Council adopted a package of six new legislative acts, upon a proposal by the European Commission and which will come into force on 13 December 2011. It represents a major step towards economic stability, restoring confidence and preventing future crises in the euro area and the EU..
Deficit
From 13 December 2011 onwards, financial sanctions will apply to euro area Member States that do not take adequate action. Member States currently in excessive deficit procedure should comply with the specific recommendations the Council addressed to them to correct their excessive deficit. In case a euro area Member States does not respect its obligations, a financial sanction can be imposed by the Council on the basis of a Commission recommendation, unless a qualified majority of Member States vote against it. This is the so-called “reverse qualified majority” voting procedure1, which makes the enforcement of the rules stricter and more automatic, therefore more dissuasive and credible. Such a financial sanction can be activated at any moment after 13 December, if and when the conditions are met.
Public debt
The new rules of the amended Stability and Growth Pact make the debt criterion of the Treaty absolutely operational, since it has been largely neglected over the past years. Another major element of the new rules is that a new numerical debt benchmark has been defined: if the 60% reference for the debt-to-GDP ratio is not respected, the Member State concerned will be put in excessive deficit procedure (even if its deficit is below 3%!), after taking into account all relevant factors and the impact of the economic cycle, if the gap between its debt level and the 60% reference is not reduced by 1/20th annually (on average over 3 years).
Given that that most Member States are already in excessive deficit procedure, and therefore have to comply with agreed fiscal consolidation paths, a transitional period is foreseen in the amended legislation to ensure no abrupt change in these agreed paths. Accordingly, each Member State in excessive deficit procedure is granted a three-year period following the correction of the excessive deficit for meeting the debt rule. This does not mean that the debt rule does not apply at all during this period as the amended Regulation foresees that Member States should make sufficient progress towards compliance during this transitional period. A negative assessment of the progress made towards compliance with the debt benchmark during the transition period could lead to the opening of an excessive deficit procedure. Sufficient progress towards compliance with the debt rule should start on 13 December 2011, depending on country-specific deadlines for correction of their excessive deficit.
The expenditure benchmark under the preventive arm of the Pact
The preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact guides Member States towards a country-specific, medium-term budgetary objective (MTO) which sets out to ensure public finance sustainability. The new rules define a new 'expenditure benchmark' to help assess progress towards these MTOs. This expenditure benchmark places a cap on the annual growth of public expenditure according to a medium-term rate of growth. For Member States that have not yet reached their MTO, the rate of growth of expenditure should be below this reference rate in order to ensure adequate progress.
This new instrument will improve the budgetary planning and outcomes of Member States by ensuring that expenditure plans are adequately resourced by equivalent permanent revenues. However, it does not constrain, in any way, the level of public expenditure, as long as it is financed effectively.
The provisions of the preventive arm of the Pact provide the main guidance for budgetary planning and budgetary execution by Member States when they are not subject to an excessive deficit procedure. Today, this is only the case for Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. All the other EU member States are in the corrective arm.
Effective enforcement of the rules is as important as the rules themselves. This equally applies to the preventive arm. The amended Stability and Growth Pact allows stronger action when the budgetary execution of a Member State deviates significantly. In order to enforce this rule, deviations have been quantified and can lead to a financial sanction (an interest-bearing deposit of 0.2% of GDP as a rule) in case of continuous non-correction. Such a sanction is proposed by the Commission and adopted by “reverse qualified majority” voting in the Council.
Furthermore, if its budgetary plans do not comply with the provisions of the preventive arm, a Member State can be requested to present new plans that do comply. Member States not in EDP will have to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of the preventive arm in their next stability or convergence programmes as of next Spring 2012, in the context of the European Semester. Member States under EDP should show compliance after the correction of their excessive deficit.
Reducing macro-economic imbalances
Over the past decade, the EU has registered serious gaps in competitiveness and major macroeconomic imbalances. A new surveillance and enforcement mechanism has been set up to identify and correct such issues much earlier: the Excessive Imbalances Procedure (EIP), based on Article 121.6 of the Treaty. It will rely on the following main elements:
- Preventive and corrective action: The new for euro area countries. It consists of a two-step approach whereby.
- An early warning system: an alert system is established based on an economic reading of a scoreboard consisting of a set of ten indicators covering the major sources of macro-economic imbalances. The composition of the scoreboard indicators may evolve over time. The aim of the scoreboard is to trigger in-depth studies which will do deep dive analyses to determine whether the potential imbalances identified in the early-warning system are benign or problematic. The Commission can organise missions, with the ECB if appropriate, to conduct the in-depth reviews which shall be made public.
Planned scoreboard
3 year backward moving average of the current account balance as a percent of GDP, with the a threshold of +6% of GDP and - 4% of GDP;
net international investment position as a percent of GDP, with a threshold of -35% of GDP;
5 years percentage change of export market shares measured in values, with a threshold of -6%;
3 years percentage change in nominal unit labour cost, with thresholds of +9% for euro-area countries and +12% for non-euro-area countries.
3 years percentage change of the real effective exchange rates based on HICP/CPI deflators, relative to 35 other industrial countries, with thresholds of -/+5% for euro-area countries and -/+11% for non-euro-area countries;
private sector debt in % of GDP with a threshold of 160%;

A kind of dress shoe for men. Usually in black, though maybe in brown, wingtips are characterized by their decoration. Wingtips have somewhat pointed toes and have 6 to 12 eyelets laced by thin round shoe laces. Usually made of shiny leather, although suede examples also exist.
The "wingtip" decoration is found on a extra piece of leather on the toes and at the edges of the individual pieces of leather that make up the shoe. The decoration consists of holes of various sizes that make up a pattern.
A good example is the Florsheim Lexington Wing Tip.
I once read about a man's first day working at IBM in the early 60's. He was fresh out of college. Like everyone else at IBM, he came to work in a suit. His boss looked him over, pointed to his shoes and asked him what the hell those were. He pointed out that they were loafers. His boss told him to go home, and come back the next day wearing wingtips.
In my opinion, wingtips are the dressiest of the male dress shoes.
To trace the history of the wing tipped shoe one must start at its
birthplace; the Isle of Skye. Although sources agree that the wing
shaped tip originated there, in shoe terminology the word tip describes
any shaped piece of material that covers the portion of the shoe distal
to the vamp, determining when the design first appeared is a detail that
has been lost to the sands of time. A study of politics may not seem
related to shoe history and many factors may influence why a particular
shoe became popular however wearing of the more relaxed, casual Oxford
shoe is generally viewed as a break from the more formal shoes and boots
of the previous century and a general easing away from the strait laced
rigidity of the Victorian era.
A type of Oxford styled shoe the wing tip spread through the United
Kingdom after its inception. Reportedly students attending Oxford
University helped reduce boot shaft height during the turn of the 19th
century by rebelliously preferring half boots to full length knee high
footwear. This resulted in the appearance of the Oxonian boot after
which the Oxford shoe was modeled. A similar rejection of the shortened
boots in favor of lower cut shoes at the beginning of the 20th century
gave the name of the town to the shoes students wore, the name stuck and
Oxford as a descriptive shoe term lives on today.
Originally marketed as an athletic leisure shoe for golfers much as the white
buck shoe was sold to tennis players of the day wing tipped shoe
sales rose during the early 20th century for several reasons: the
automobile is gradually replacing travel by horse decreasing the need
for boots (most women still wore boots to drive), city life becomes more
attractive than rural farm life which further decreases the desire for
boots, returning American soldiers prefer the roomy comfort and easy donning of the low
cut Oxford style shoes they discovered overseas, and shoes require less
material than boots making them cheaper to produce during a war time economy.
During the reign of Edward VII the short tuxedo coat paired with
less
formal shoes such as the wingtip become an increasingly acceptable mode
of daytime dress.
By 1910 the longer swallow tail coat and dress pumps are still
considered proper evening wear but are gradually losing their
stranglehold on nighttime formal dress apparel. As women's shoes are
mostly hidden under and beneath skirts not much attention is paid to
their footwear although Mary Janes, or bar shoes, are gaining in
popularity. Other shoe styles available for women at this time include
slippers, clogs, and boots with buttons.
Prosperity reigned during the 1920s however the next decade brought
sobering consequences for those who had enjoyed the highlife during the
glorious stock market rise. By the time the Great Depression hit the
United States of America boots are worn mainly by farmers and certain
factory workers although a notable exception is the cowboy boot. While
the wing tip shoe is now accepted as a business shoe the color scheme
has changed from black to brown. Knickers, which are worn with wingtips,
are banned by Oxford University in 1925. Wily students retaliated by
favoring baggy trousers that could be worn over the academically
unacceptable plus-fours.
Worldwide the 1930s is a decade of political unrest and instability,
setting the stage for the conflict known as World War II. Again the war
time economy directs goods towards munitions, uniforms, and rations and
away from retail and grocery stores. People who have money have few
items to purchase. Soldiers enjoy Wrigley's gum and Hershey's chocolate
bars along with Lucky Strike cigarettes while civilians have to make
due with Sen-Sen and makeup paint for legs as nylon has been diverted
towards parachute manufacturing. Cutout, Peep-toe, and slingback shoes
for women can be made with less material than shoes with full toe
coverings. Leather is in high demand for war time efforts. Fabric shoes
become more common. Light, material saving ballerina flats are popular
shoes for female students attending school during the 1940s.
Before World War II there were two main classes of citizens in the
United States: city dwellers and the rural populace. After the war a new
blend known as suburbia emerged. Shoe styles for women exploded as war
time restrictions vanished. Heels narrowed, the chunky wedge style of
the previous decade gives way to the sleeker, sexier, stiletto. Pumps
for women are popular, shoes for women can be found in virtually any
color to match any outfit imaginable. Young girls favor saddle shoes and
bobby socks however men are left with few choices and a much slimmer
color palate. Loafers and wingtips are standard dress fare. Crepe soled
brothel creepers made a brief appearance, other casual styles
including white buck shoes are worn although another shoe is gaining
market share as people with leisure time sport black Chuck
Taylors.
Business casual is a relatively recent term, for the majority of the
20th century suits were appropriate business attire. To address the
point fhayashi makes IBM expected its employees to wear dark suits,
gray was also permitted, knowledge of the dress code was expected and
anticipated. Thus far the wingtip has changed little through the
decades. That changes when a shoe known as the Longwing emerged during
the 1970s. Named for the wing extensions on the shoes which now extend
to the rear of the shoe, lasting of the shoe was redone. The result was a
trimmer, more modern shoe. Moving on into the 1980s the wingtip is
still a shoe for the business world which is considered dressier than
loafers of any style.
The 1990s as a decade is one I have personal experience with. After
college I was hired by a firm named Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover,
we were required to state the entire name when we answered the phone
since the merger with Morgan Stanley had just gone through. While I
remember spending $80 on a pearly silver pair of Etienne Aigner heels
that went surprisingly well with most of my suits every man I worked
with wore black dress shoes and most of them wore wingtips. My husband
was an IT drone for the now defunct Arthur Andersen, he had two pairs
of black dress shoes although his wingtips had a monk strap instead of
laces.
Wingtips suffered during the first part of the 21st century as more companies adopted business casual dress codes; today wingtips are making a comeback. Those who believe they can not
afford to purchase a good pair of
shoes or a nice suit are still able to shop for these goods. Inform
sales people that you are not able to purchase anything but
are interested in determining what cuts will work best for you. Building
your wardrobe around good supportive shoes shoes insures that your
body will remain in alignment as you go about whatever your day has in
store for you. Good shoes are relaxing,
stabilizing, confidence builders. Looking your best means knowing that
you have done your homework, shop at thrift stores if you must, try on
as many different pieces of clothing as you need to but do not settle
for anything less than a great fit which will stand you in good stead as
fashions come and go.
While a good pair of wing tipped shoes may set the wearer back,
properly cared for, these shoes can provide years of comfortable
utility. Wingtips are the travelers friend, able to smoothly transition
from airport to business meeting to supper date to theater outing. In a
pinch they can be worn on the golf course since they were originally
designed as a golf shoe. Requiring little in terms of maintenance all
shoes should be routinely shined and inspected for excess wear as early repairs may
save a shoe from ruin. While wingtips are frequently thought of as a
men's shoe, women's styles are also available, offering the same
functional advantages to what was formerly known as the fairer sex. A wardrobe building shoe for men and
women; consider the wingtip a foundation piece designed to
keep their owners in good standing.

A reputable art historian once told
me that it is something of a standing joke that in the panel depicting the fall
of man in the Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes, Michelangelo has deliberately
posed Adam and Eve in such a way that her momentary distraction towards the
serpent and eating the forbidden fruit has taken her attention away from eating
a different type of fruit attached to Adam's body. Michelangelo was certainly
clever enough to have embedded this as an inside joke, as we see, for example, in
the way he puts
friends and foes into the last judgment.
Michelangelo was probably reading
his Bible correctly, however, even if he has suggestively particularized the
sexual connotation of eating from the tree
of knowledge into edenic fellatio. The trick here is to see first of all
that Michelangelo is not creating a narrative that plays out
linearly like a story--he's making us work a little harder by compacting
the action into a single scene. Eve is not just turning from having oral
sex with Adam to get the forbidden fruit; the idea of sex and the
fall are merely being put into close juxtaposition (if you insist on reading
from left to right you might think of it a bit like the literary figure of hysteron
proteron).
But even more tellingly, if you examine the image at the link below,
you'll see that Michelangelo is clearly compressing action by having the same
scene show Adam and Eve twice, once before the fall, and once shortly thereafter;
serpent, tree, and angel act as a sort of pivot between the episodes. As another
sign that Michelangelo is visibly playing with "chronology" for
the sake of deeper purposes, see the sizeable dead tree trunk the tempted Eve
is leaning against. If you've been to a cemetary with monuments lately you'll
have seen that even now broken trees (and headless columns) are symbols of death.
If you work out the math you can see the message. But this is Eden, created
only a little while before--what is a tree trunk so old it is already a broken,
withered stump doing there?
The second trick in interpreting
this scene correctly is to remember that Michelangelo (and his contemporaries)
were not Biblical literalists (clearly: this compressed
scene cannot be reconstructed literally from Genesis 3: 1-7). Michelangelo felt
no fundamentalist urge to avoid metaphorical or allegorical
interpretation of scripture, and this opened up the way for a rich understanding
of the text. In 1667, Milton, too, clearly saw the connection between
sex and the fall in his Paradise Lost (9.1011-1045),
and had no problem with depicting it.
But it's not just that Adam and Eve
were naughty and that this got them hustled out of the garden, and then the
author of Genesis prudishly disguised their "sin" behind a "tree
of knowledge" allegory. The author of Genesis was seeking a way to explain
why life is so hard. He believed that a transgression against God was
involved, of course, and adapted a story which was almost as old to him as he
is to us to craft an explanation. A version of this ancient story exists in
fragmentary form in the widely-noded Epic of Gilgamesh. Interestingly, the author of Genesis turned the Gilgamesh
story on its head to adapt it to his purposes. (The Epic of Gilgamesh
was widely known throughout the ancient middle east in several versions, and
the story it tells was probably circulating as various shorter folk tales the
whole time.)
In the Gilgamesh, for purposes
unconnected with this writeup, a wild man named Enkidu is created by the gods from a pinch of clay (like the dust that went into Adam).
Enkidu hangs out with the wild animals, living pretty much like one of them
(the translation I am dependent upon uses the leading term "child of nature"
for him). The idea is that he is good raw material. He angers a trapper by spoiling
his traps and as a result the authorities decide to domesticate this natural
force which is hampering the labors of civilization.
Now it gets interesting. Advised
by his betters, the trapper fetches a pretty temple prostitute
(honorably serving a stint performing sex as an offering to Ishtar, goddess
of you-know-what, and presumably pretty good at it) from the big city
and brings her out to Enkidu's haunts. When Enkidu next comes to get a drink
of water she reveals herself to him (in more than one way) and Enkidu ravishes
her for six days and seven nights without leaving her body. When Enkidu
"comes to," he finds himself irretrievably altered.
A few verses :.
Sex (and implicitly, domestication
through contact with woman) has wrought this change, and knowledge ('reason and
wide understanding') is the result. Enkidu has lost his (from one point of view)
edenic existence of simple pleasures, but as the story unfolds he is slowly
acculturated to mankind and civilization..
Where he earlier spoiled traps, he
now stands guard over the flock for the group of shepherds who have introduced
him to the pleasures of bread and wine (civilized, processed foods,
that is), thwarting the natural predation of wolves and lions. We are so culturally
accustomed to approve a version of the Golden Age myth
which goes back to nature and some sort of primordial purity and goodness that
it comes as a genuine shock to realize that they are celebrating getting
away from nature and becoming more sophisticated and civilized--or more
human, as they would see it. Call it anti-pastoral.
And now with new eyes we can look
at Adam and Eve's rustling of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. When they
eat the fruit "the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were
naked." Naked indeed, with all of its sexual connotations: why did they
make "aprons" out of fig leaves for themselves if there were not something
they suddenly knew about in regions an apron covers which now embarrasses them?
The knowledge
they have earned by eating the fruit is the purpose and function of genitalia.
Sex (and procreation) brings them the immortality the serpent promised, but
a vicarious intergenerational immortality. As for themselves, when they got
the power to create life like God, they were smacked down for it with personal
mortality and banishment from a life of ease.
The Genesis account is not as explicit
but nevertheless lines up astonishingly well with the story of Enkidu; but instead
of looking at the good side of knowledge and domestication, the author of Genesis
chose to adapt the story to explain why life is hard by portraying the acquisition of knowledge as a transgression
that leads from a better state of nature to a harder one of labors and death.
How much Genesis prompts us to be sympathetic with a "back to nature"
program, and how much that program prompts us to look sympathetically on Genesis'
idea of a fall is anyone's guess. But Michelangelo was right on the mark, and
without the benefit of Gilgamesh, which was found much later.
A good image of the fresco in question:
Brandon, S.G.F. Creation Legends of the Ancient Near East (1963). Brandon
sometimes goes a little too far, but this is the best psychosexual treatment
of Genesis, Gilgamesh, and their overlap I
have yet seen.

I can only describe my feeling by the metaphor, that,if a man could write a book on Ethics which really was a book on Ethics, this book would, with an explosion, destroy all the other books in the world.
-Wittgenstein, “A Lecture on Ethics”
Wittgenstein’s work and thought on ethics remains a largely enigmatic area of his overall body of work. Yet throughout his career, Wittgenstein held ethics to be a crucial part of his philosophy. The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus is, according to him, fundamentally a book about ethics1 ; however, Wittgenstein’s ethics are of quite a different sort than we might find being developed by Kantian deontologists or utilitarians. Quite contrary to any conventional ethics, Wittgenstein’s is one of restraint, of withholding, rather than theorizing or promulgating. In the Tractatus, he writes, “it is clear that ethics cannot be put into words. Ethics is transcendental” {TLP 6.421}. But what does he mean by this kind of talk? The Vienna Circle interpreted Wittgenstein as taking up a positivist stance– ethical propositions, as nonsense {TLP 3-4}, are to be excluded. For Wittgenstein, anything that cannot be represented by propositions in language is nonsense. To quote A.J. Ayer on the Tractatus, “metaphysical pronouncements fail to represent anything. They are nonsensical. At their best they are attempts to say what cannot be said but only shown. This applies to ethics and aesthetics” {PTC 112}.
I would like to argue that Wittgenstein’s assertions about ethics embody a critical attitude toward philosophical language. This attitude is one that sees the preservation of ethics as lying in an anti-philosophical (or perhaps extra-philosophical) approach. Of course, this statement requires some qualification. I do not mean to say that Wittgenstein is not doing philosophy; it is obvious that the contrary is true. I would like to suggest, however, that his philosophy functions by showing limitations: not only the limitations of language, but also the limitations of philosophical activity itself. Furthermore, I would like to suggest that it is the most important things that fall outside of representation. This is why it is important to invoke the distinction between saying and showing. By saying, we can express certain ideas; by showing, we can express others2. Not everything that can be shown can be said. For instance, we can show that a mathematical equation works and we can also say that it works, but we cannot say anything about the nature of numbers themselves. We can show the idea of infinity, but we cannot express it properly in language. Similarly, we can “get at” or show ethical ideas, but no set of propositions can capture ethics. Poetry and literature may perhaps be able to better give us a sense of ethical thought than philosophy. This is related to Wittgenstein’s “religious” point of view. In his work, Wittgenstein seeks to move away from explanation and justification, and move toward something more concrete and immediate. As Norman Malcolm puts it,
A possible clue my lie in the reiterated theme of his writings, that explanations, reasons, justifications, come to an end. This theme itself needs to be clarified. Does it mean that there are no justifications for anything? Or does it mean that there are – but only up to a certain point? If so, what is that point? Can it be described? {WR 2}
These questions, as I see them, are central to proposing the kind of ethics that we can draw out of Wittgenstein’s work. They point first and foremost to a rejection of a mistaken commitment to a certain kind of metaphysics. I would call this metaphysics the metaphysics of science, but that is too crude a moniker to attach, and I will clarify it through the paper. Fundamentally, Wittgenstein’s view tries to show the ways in which philosophical language can and cannot be used appropriately. The use of “nonsense” and “silence” do not necessarily carry negative connotations, and Wittgenstein’s picture of the ladder up and out of philosophy {TLP 6.54} is immensely valuable. In this paper, I will expand upon these ideas3 and try to bring out some ideas about ethical living outside of philosophical theory.
Wittgenstein’s critique of philosophy
Wittgenstein’s main objection toward philosophy is its pretension of being able to “catch” everything. Along with the advent of the scientific method, philosophy has been used to analyze the world and contain it within a framework that supposedly tells us the truth about things. In a sense, philosophy and science have purported to reflect the contents of the world in a meaningful way. Because of this, a certain vocabulary has taken a primary place in our talk about the world and about ourselves; “thus,” Wittgenstein writes, ” {Ibid. 6.372}. By now, this is not an uncommon comment to make. In Mind and World, John McDowell writes, “if we conceive the natural as the realm of law, demarcating it by the way its proper mode of intelligibility contrasts with the intelligibility of the space of reasons, we put at risk the very idea that spontaneity might characterize the works of our sensibility as such” {MW 71}. Of course, this refers to problems in the philosophy of mind, but it is an example of how one way of thinking and speaking has taken hold in philosophical activity in general. The notion of explaining everything has become violent; at the very least, the traditional philosophical commitment to this view of the world has caused serious problems for ideas about the self as well as religion and the supernatural. The causal efficacy of the mind, for instance, has been marginalized and excluded because it cannot properly figure into scientific or physicalist accounts of causation4 .
Why are we in this position, though? Why do we feel the need to stick with it? As Wittgenstein says, again in the Tractatus, “the whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena” {Ibid. 6.371}. It is important to notice that he uses the word “explanation” here. “Explanation” implies that a truthful story is being told about something; however, can everything actually be explained? Moreover, is explanation meant to have such an all-encompassing function in the first place? Is it necessary to use this type of talk to represent the world? Wittgenstein thinks that it is not.
By putting thought in its proper place, Wittgenstein’s transcendental critique wants both to preserve the legitimate role of thinking in natural science and to prevent its encroachment into territory reserved to other human interests, much as Kant wanted his critique to limit knowledge in order to make room for faith. For Kant and Wittgenstein some things must be passed over with that pregnant silence which indicates that representation is out of its depth. {EWP 12}
Here James Edwards makes an appropriate connection between Kant and Wittgenstein: in the Critiques, Kant tried to highlight the limitations of representation and thus show that there are things about which we can make no final judgment or analysis5 . Wittgenstein tries to do the same in his work. When he says something like “the law of causality is not a law but the form of a law” {TLP 6.32}, he means that the way in which we describe it takes on a law-like character. Description is often mistaken for explanation: what may suffice as a good practical framework for moving around in the world is often misinterpreted as a foundational picture of it. Another way of putting it is that explanation is a form of justification; description, on the other hand, does not necessarily require justification. If we hold our propositions only to a standard of pragmatic use, we may not run into the kind of philosophical confusion that troubles Wittgenstein. Logic, for instance, can play the role of demarcating the world’s structural/formal traits:
At 4.4511 Wittgenstein says that a tautology, while it says nothing, is not nonsensical, because it is a “part of the symbolism”, like the ‘0’ (zero) in mathematics. A tautology is part of the symbolism because by considering it one learns something of how to operate with its constituent symbols. And, since these symbols represent propositions, one at the same time learns something of how to operate in the world. That’s what is meant at 6.12 when he says that logic mirrors the formal properties of the world, as well as those of language. A tautology does not depict the world of contingent states of affairs; yet it conveys knowledge of the formal structure of language and the world. {EWP 55}
Logical propositions are useful for purposes such as predicting consequences of actions (making causal claims, in other words), understanding that certain events occur regularly, and so on; logical propositions cannot, however, get any grasp on what makes those things happen, or even (with total certainty, at any rate) how they happen. They can show, not say – but then again, the showing occurs in the saying, to some degree6 – ideas about the world.
Edwards argues that ethical propositions are of the same order. “The remarks of ethics, which literally cannot be said … are attempts to convey a sort of practical knowledge; it is a knowledge of how to live so as to give a sense to the world” {Ibid. 57}. Both logic and ethics can provide us with useful knowledge, but that knowledge does not necessarily point to any metaphysical truths. Moreover, Wittgenstein says, we do not need metaphysical truths for propositions to be useful; in fact, it is the desire to obtain metaphysical truths that causes us to speak nonsense. Metaphysics is a manner of explanation and justification: it constructs foundations that anchor our view of the world. The problem is that we cannot be certain of those foundations, however much we wish it. When we incorporate metaphysical mistakes into our talk about the world, we begin to make nonsensical propositions. By saying nonsensical things, we are essentially trying to articulate what cannot be articulated; in other words, we are trying to get at something but only coming up with senseless statements. as the beautiful.) And it is not surprising that the deepest problems are in fact not problems at all. {TLP 4.003}
Nonsense consists in the production of meaningless ideas through the misuse of language. If we take this to be true, then philosophy really is plagued with nonsense, since throughout history, philosophers have been asking questions about God, the nature of time, the soul, and myriad other problems.
Is “nonsense” necessarily a pejorative term, though? I would suggest that it is not. Ayer says that
I wholeheartedly endorsed Wittgenstein’s conclusion that metaphysical utterances were nonsensical but did not count the utterances of the Tractatus itself among them. I did not see, and still do not see, how a sentence could at one and the same time express a pseudo-proposition and an unassailable truth. I agreed rather with Ramsey that ‘if the chief proposition of philosophy is that philosophy is nonsense … we must then take it seriously that it is nonsense, and not pretend, as Wittgenstein does, that it is important nonsense’. {PTC 112-3}
If we consider this problem in relation to §435 of the Investigations, we may see how Wittgenstein believed the propositions of the Tractatus to be at once nonsensical and truthful. In articulating what ultimately turns out to be nonsensical because it ends up running into its own limits, we are able to convey, to show that limitation as well as the function of language, properly conceived. Thus the truth of the Tractatus’ propositions lies not in the expressed content of the propositions themselves, but rather the truth that they reveal. Furthermore, Wittgenstein says in the introduction to the Tractatus that “the truth of the thoughts that are here communicated seems to me unassailable and definitive” {TLP p. 4}; this is a subtlety that may also answer Ayer’s question. The thoughts communicated in the Tractatus are not solely to be found in the propositions on the page. “My work consists of two parts: the one presented here plus all I have not written. And it is precisely the second part that is the important one” {PT 16}. On this view, we can see that there is no conflict between the assertion that the Tractatus is at once full of nonsense and truth.
The point of this is that nonsense does not have to be seen as pernicious or even always useless. Edwards notes that
since, according to the doctrines of the Tractatus, ethics, logic, and Tractarian philosophy all lie outside the boundaries of sense, ‘nonsense’ is not always a derogatory characterization in Wittgenstein’s early vocabulary. Sometimes there is something that cannot be conveyed except by uttering something that is, strictly speaking, nonsense. This is the case for the propositions of logic: they show the formal structure of language and world; but they are themselves literally senseless. They do not represent the existence of contingent states of affairs. It is also the case for Wittgenstein’s philosophy itself. Witness the Tractatus: it says nothing, but intends to show everything important. {EWP 106}
So what distinguishes useful nonsense from dangerous or misused nonsense? I would suggest that the difference lies in justification. When nonsensical propositions are set up as–or made part of–metaphysical foundations7 , they become dangerous: they lead us into confusion and misunderstanding. Plato’s myth of the immortality of the soul may become dangerous if it is transformed into philosophical doctrine; however, when it is employed merely to convey some idea without trying to ground it in “truth” or justify it, it can be useful in what it points to or shows. As Wittgenstein says in Culture and Value, “don’t for heaven’s sake, be afraid of talking nonsense! But you must pay attention to your nonsense” {CV 56e}. This distinction is of the utmost importance. It is the difference between the Tractatus and a work such as Jaegwon Kim’s Mind In A Physical World, which refuses to see the inherent meaninglessness of trying to talk about the mind and the body as somehow separate or bound in a hierarchical relationship8 . Philosophical inquiry can congeal and harden into doctrine from which it is difficult to escape: we become the fly in a bottle {PI §309} of our own construction. We become forgetful, we are convinced that this is the way things are. In Wittgenstein’s words:
 the frame through which we look at it. {PI §114}
Here we see another theme emerging: certainty. Mistaking propositions for a priori or unconditional truths both spurs on and satisfies the desire for absolute certainty – epistemological or metaphysical safety, as it were. Yet is certainty possible? Or is it, on the other hand, a false hope? “’But this is how it is––––‘ I say to myself over and over again. I feel as though, if only I could fix my gaze absolutely sharply on this face, get it in focus, I must grasp the essence of the matter” {Ibid. §113}. Our fixation on the frame, as Wittgenstein puts it, gives us the illusion that we have certain knowledge of the thing being framed; however, as the seemingly endless stream of philosophical problems implies, the illusion is an illusion and not much –if anything– else.
The religious point of view
So far we have been examining Wittgenstein’s critique of philosophy. The most prominent problem appears to be the unwarranted and untenable development of metaphysical roots– a development that may have come about accidentally, or may simply be a normal, unavoidable byproduct of the way in which we use language. Of course, because it is unavoidable does not mean it is not troublesome9 . It is also, in a sense, dishonest. Despite the warnings of Hume and Kant, we still fall into the trap of assuming that everything can be explained. We assume that propositions about the world accurately and fully represent it, even though we would see after some examination that this is not always the case. Thus, we are certain of propositions’ validity– but what do we know? How can we say that we have a firm purchase on reality, if there is no way to get outside and make sure? Yet certainty is not in itself a bad thing; just as the propositions of logic provide us with practical knowledge, certainty is also practical. When we are certain, we have a coherent view of our own world. “I act with complete certainty. But this certainty is my own” {OC §174}. There is a catch: the ground (and this is a troublesome word, to be sure!) upon which we stand is always ours; it does not come from external and “objective” point of view. The ground, then, is not a ground insofar as it is not rooting us in anything permanent or absolute. Rather, it is the way our world is constituted, the way in which it comes together for us. It is not above or below us. It is there, in the most immediate way. For instance: goes unnoticed. {Ibid. §167}
Our world-picture is bound up in our everyday lives; it has been given to us by virtue of the fact that we are born into a community of language-users. The important thing about all of this is that it brings out the way in which explanation does come to an end at some point. For all of us, there is a limit to what we can sensibly doubt; outside of that limit, it does not make sense to doubt. We do not doubt that the sun will rise tomorrow, and the day after that, and so on. None of us can say, though, that we know that it will rise {TLP 6.36311}; as Wittgenstein says, “There is no compulsion in making one thing happen because another has happened. The only necessity that exists is logical necessity” {Ibid. 6.37}.
We all essentially take on a religious point of view at some point or another. When we arrive at the point at which doubt no longer makes sense if we are to make sense of the world, we have reached the end of justification and the end of explanation. Consider logical propositions: we have no way of knowing if they do not merely approximate some kind of correlation to reality by way of a fortuitous accident, or if there is some meaningful way in which they can help us gain practical knowledge about the formal structure of the world. Despite this, we do not focus on doubting logic’s efficacy; we just accept it. In this way, we all take up a religious point of view at some point. To think of it another way, “we are satisfied that the earth is round” {OC §299}. In this way, the world-picture given to us by science is just as religious as the “properly” religious one. We cannot in the end escape from it. “The difficulty is to realize the groundlessness of our beliefs” {Ibid. §166}.
If the difficulty is to realize the groundlessness of our beliefs, then our task should be to make that realization. This consists in paying attention to our nonsense, and not making the mistake of constantly searching for justification and explanation. We have to forsake the safety of false certainty and adopt a more critical stance in relation to our propositions about the world. Wittgenstein holds that we will then recognize the non-existence of many philosophical problems and be able to work our way out of them instead of bouncing back and forth inside of them without solving anything. He writes, “my propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them–as steps–to climb up beyond them” {TLP 6.54}. Of course, the Tractarian notion that we can just escape is not really present in the later Wittgenstein; instead, we have the notion of philosophical therapy.
It is not our aim to refine or complete the system of rules for the use of our words in unheard-of ways.. There is not a philosophical method, though there are indeed different methods, like different therapies. {PI §133}
The idea is that we start to unravel and extricate ourselves from philosophical confusion and anxiety. In essence, we are taking philosophy apart instead of trying to iron out its wrinkles; we are dismantling instead of tinkering10 .
When we start backing out of (or perhaps fighting through) the false problems and booby traps of philosophy, where do we end up? Since we are refusing the need for justification, we move into a religious point of view. No longer do we cleave to endless explanation and the desire for absolute knowledge; instead, we adopt a more honest way of relating to the propositions that we use and the language-games that we play. “An honest religious thinker is like a tightrope walker. He almost looks as though he were walking on nothing but air. His support is the slenderest imaginable. And yet it is really possible to walk on it” {CV 73e}. Instead of endless nonsensical babble, we start to choose silence. This silence is not truly the refrain of someone not saying something; it is the silence that occurs when there is nothing to say. This, I would suggest, is what Wittgenstein means by saying “I am not a religious man, but I cannot help seeing any problem from a religious point of view” {LW 94}. It is that tightrope walk, the other road we can take instead of winding ourselves up into the false promises of metaphysics.
Ethics
If we take up the kind of activity proposed by Wittgenstein, the notion of ethics also takes on a very different cast. Rather than the construction of theories or doctrines, ethics on this view takes the form of a resistance. It is resistant to philosophy, and most importantly, it is resistant to codification. In “A Lecture on Ethics”, Wittgenstein says, value, can be no science. What it says does not add to our knowledge in any sense. {LE 44}
As we saw earlier in the essay, nonsense is not necessarily to be condemned; indeed, if the Tractatus is any indication, it can be quite useful. Its use, however, is found in showing. Accordingly, I would suggest that we can engage in nonsensical talk about ethics, but not as a means of directly articulating ethical “truths”. Instead, we can convey ideas about ethics by showing them through our various activities within language-games. As I said in the introduction, literature and poetry can play this kind of role. In Ethics Without Philosophy, Edwards writes that
there is no way directly to say what cannot be said. But there are things that can be said which will ‘contain’ the unsayable: to say these things is somehow to communicate what is in itself unsayable. A poem is an example of this phenomenon: it can communicate some ineffable truth about life while talking about the growth of a sprig into a hawthorn bush. A poem may alter one’s whole view of the world, making happy what was unhappy; and it is no accident that the poem makes the change possible. Perhaps without the poem the alteration would never have occurred. {EWP 51-2}
Ethical ideas cannot be said, but they indeed can be communicated or shown, thus preventing us from being sealed off into so many solipsistic units. We can indeed affirm ethical stances and beliefs; in The Writing of the Disaster, Maurice Blanchot writes, “affirmation does without proof, provided it claims to prove nothing” {WD 62}; here we see how ethics can thrive (as can ideas about many other meaningful things in life) without the justification of philosophy. But what of lost “objectivity”– how do we prevent the slide into chaotic subjectivity and relativism? The fact that language-games are shared forms of life {PI §23} into which we are all born and initiated shows that we do have a milieu in which the communication of ideas can and does take place. In fact, it would not make sense to deny this! Language is deeply11 and fully a part of our lives and what constitutes us as human beings. Before philosophizing (as well as scientific inquiry) became a cardinal language-game and form of life, ethical living existed: we are not dependent upon it to continue to sustain ethical living.
Conclusion
An ethics proposed on the strength of Wittgenstein’s religious point of view could not properly be called an ethics. It could not really be theorized or codified: we cannot say the unsayable. Wittgenstein “connects theory, naturally enough, with the concept of explanation; and philosophical explanation he understands to be the attempt to provide foundations” {EWP 99}; since foundations present nothing more than an illusion that leads to misinterpretation and confusion, they should be discarded. If anything, ethical behaviour and thought should be rooted in our forms of life, not in an appeal to a set of regulations or some philosophical doctrine. We can perhaps articulate ideas about ethics, but it is not in the utterances themselves that we see the most meaningful notions. Rather, I would say that the utterances simply point to something that cannot be captured –not necessarily because they are transcendental, as Wittgenstein said in the Tractatus, but perhaps because they are too broad and too complex–by them; the general impulse or direction of ethical propositions can help convey what we really mean, or point us toward what really merits attention and contemplation.
In terms of practical matters, ethics on this view would not be treated the same way as philosophical theories. We would not, for instance, try to reconfigure some utilitarian calculus of the “good” over and over again until we got it right. Nor would we ask questions such as whether the good is identical to the beautiful. Instead, I would suggest that issues of the treatment of others would come to the fore, since all ethical thought would occur within forms of life not touched upon by theory. A blanket solution would not be imposed on myriad problems, just creating a disjunction between propositions and the everyday situations to which they supposedly pertain. Propositions (that is, logical propositions or globalizing statements), as we have said, cannot capture contingent states of affairs: this is why propositions about ethics are nothing more than chatter in the end. Realizing this, we can adopt a more critical attitude toward ethical problems, one that does not ignore particular situations in favour of more general ideas. We may be running up against the walls of a cage, but at least we may be doing it in new and different ways every time. Ethical discourse might not, on this view, be restricted to what counts as “rational”; thus, our possibilities for discourse with one another may become fruitful and multiply. This, I suggest, is the type of ethical practice and living that Wittgenstein has in mind when he calls for a refusal of philosophy.

Jack may be the coolest kid I've come across in ages. Creepy Train Conductor is by far my fave -- and he works it well in the photo!
He's a dead ringer for the train conductor on my commuter train. Peace man! Excellent entries.
It's so hard to choose a favourite when all of these costumes are so freakin awesome! Creepy train Conductor is brilliant (love the pose) but I think he makes an exceptionally fine Beatle - I'm just pleased that someone under the age of 25 knows who John Lennon is!
I thought I had killed all of my maternal instincts, but you're really making me want to go get knocked up. I want a human doll that I can dress up every Halloween!! :)
These costumes are all very creative...I love Bart. And that creepy train conductor...holy shit. Creepy is right.
Those are all excellent costumes! There's something so cool about getting your kid dressed up in a homemade costume every year, isn't there?
Jimmy Neutron's dog - just the sound of that makes me laugh. great costumes
This is exactly why we have kids, isn't it, Sean? What a trouper Jack is! I love kids who get right into Hallowe'en! And their parents who egg them on. Well done, both of you!
Cree-pee! We love the engineer!
Happy Halloween!
Flannery and Doc
Beth - He does make a very creepy conductor. It's interesting because trains were his first real psssion so this costume was a little homage to that. Lots of fun that year!
Dale - That must be some commuter train you take. Thanks for stopping by. I've visited your blog a few times and always enjoyed.
Katrocket - I am grateful as well the offspring knows who John Lennon is. It's no easy task keeping him on track musically but a challenge I accept with honour. Loved the pic on your site by the way. Well done with that!.
Beckeye - Thank you for the compliment. Creative costumes should be the rule. Glad you liked the Bart thing he was not to happy; I painted him yellow that year and man was he popular at the party.
Bubs - Absolutely, that's why I kept him! ;-) Being a decidedly uncool kid growing up, this is an excellent way to erase past indiscretions of cool for me.
Gifted Typist - Jimmy Neutron's dog is actually one of my favourite's. Most expensive too. It took about ten cans of spray paint to coat the damn thing!
Barb - Thank you Barb! And yes, I relish Hallowe'en every year knowing I can come up with something to outdo the previous year!
Flannery and Doc - Cree pee indeed. He freaked out every kid under three for a ten mile radius that year. WE WERE VERY PROUD!!!
Thanks to all of you for stopping by and taking the time to comment. I appreciate the kind words.
Sean
You have turned halloweening into an art form, child. I luv it.

… in Star Wars, of course. I think there’s a lot of room to investigate the economics of Star Wars, and this is an interesting starting point.
For a critic of “lawfare”, Kenneth Anderson has constructed the perfect lawfare position: The use of drones to create a situation in which only one side of a war is ever allowed to engage in war.
A side of a war that relies on drones could have zero — zero! — legitimate targets. One could have a war in which one side cannot use violence at all without it being a war crime. The fellows operating the drones from Nevada are not combatants, after all — they are quite unarmed. The folks launching the drones might be, but as more and more drone functions become autonomous and as drones become cheap enough to be semi-disposable that group will shrink. The people building the drones are presumably off-limits as well.
This is quite appealing when one is affiliated with that side, but I have to wonder if Anderson would be so fond of the conclusion if it were the other side that consisted only of non-combatants and civilians.
What they said.
Unfortunately the linked article is behind a $30 paywall, so we will merely content ourselves with speculation beyond the excerpt that Caplan provides.

The view that the human religious instinct can be harnessed and redirected toward rational thought through the promotion of contemplative or legalistic faiths is manifestly false. That instinct does not revile an irrational and unconsidered view of the world, and it never will.
In line with Knapp’s post I linked earlier. When the media say “government shutdown” do not imagine that the government is shutting down. The parts of the government responsible for killing, maiming, imprisoning, and stealing remain open; it is only the bits meant to help people that stop working.
I am reminded of the “Operation: Hairshirt” of Yes, Minister fame. The government responds to a budget cut by cutting only those services that serve the people; they will never cut the services that keep them in control.
You won’t find a simpler description of why anarchism is morally mandatory than this. It’s a somewhat schematic argument, but it neatly frames the question that freedom asks and authority must (and in my view cannot) answer.
“it’s a moral illusion we’re suffering from.”
I continue to think that anarchism has difficult questions of social technology to answer (David Friedman notwithstanding, we are a long way from finishing R&D on the “machinery of freedom”). But this should be viewed as part of the long quest embarked on by the Enlightenment to bring our social means into alignment with our moral ends — the single most morally urgent task that has ever existed.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (Jackass-SC), seeing his national enemies discomforted, would like to do something about that. If only we had a word for comforting enemies…
And Lysander Spooner’s rejection of the notion of “treason” rather specifically excluded people who really did take oaths to the state…
Similar to what his colleague Tom Knapp said here (i noted it here)..
Libertarians are right to focus on reducing the total spending of government, but remember that spending is one of the least evil things that government does: at least someone gets paid when the government spends. The less costly means of enforcing compliance — the laws, the regulations, the arbitrary police actions — can do far more damage without even the fig-leaf of compensation. Cutting government by starting from the checkbook may make good coalition-building sense, but of the places to cut government it is the least liberty-enhancing, the most likely to disproportionally affect the poor and powerless, and the most likely to pull the rug from under the largest number of people knowingly or unknowingly relying on it.
It’s also bad coalition-building. In a corporatist economy, a given government cut will resound throughout the economy, causing displacement and anguish in people previously unaware that they were government clients at all. Until you start cutting laws instead of just spending, you’re building up a large store of fear and resentment for only a small dividend of growth and liberty, spending political capital with no hope of attracting a new constituency.

Idk where to begin. If I talk in circles, or dont make any sense, forgive me as I am slowing losing my mind. I hate feeling so helpless. Let me tell you a little about myself.
When I was 17yrs old, I had surgery because of a ruptured cyst. They scraped them clean, said I was good to go. I had a reg cycle up until the age of 20. Then I noticed I slowly started gaining weight even though my eating habits did not change and my cycle came less often. Went to different doctors, all told me I was fine.
When I was 22yrs old, my bf and I decided we wanted ttc. After 2 years of trying, we had a m/c. 2 months later we conceived, but didnt find out till I was 11w 6 days. I am happy to announce my princess was born New Years Eve.
from the day my daughter was born till now, it has been 7 years. While we weren't actively ttc, we weren't preventing it. I had bloodwork done (as per my RE) and he dx me with PCOS.
The RE told me the key to my success was to lose weight I explained to him I have done so but it only stays off for a while then I gain it back over time. Due to food allergies, my food options are limited so I should not have these problems.
my questions are:
a) how do you chart your O's if your irregular and each month is different
b) how long has anyone gone ttc w/o the use of meds
c) how do you deal with the stress of getting BPN when you test?
Thanks for letting me vent!

Interview with Jeffo in Brindisi
Name: Jeffo
Date of Interview: August 30, 2006
Area of Italy you live or will live in?
Brindisi, Puglia
Let us know a little about yourself?
Single and never married. I'm an Aerospace Engineer that grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio. After university I moved to Indianapolis where I lived for 10 years before Italy. I'm not your typical engineer as I have strange interests. I volunteered and worked at the Indianapolis Zoo in my spare time and my favorite sport is Ultimate Frisbee. Luckily I also played soccer growing up.
Why did you decide to move to Italy?
The main reason for me was work and I wanted an adventure. Work was getting too routine and I wanted to see the world before settling down. My mother is of Italian descent so when I saw a job within my company but based in Italy I jumped at the chance. Luck was on my side because I had the experience necessary and beat out the others trying for this position
What type of process did you go through to be able to move here?
I was coming over for work so I needed a work visa before I left and then Permesso di Soggiorno upon arrival. Sounded simple enough. I could not get dual citzenship even though my grandfather was Italian because some vital piece of paperwork in the trail was missing. Birth certificate or marriage certificate. I forget what it was but my mom's a librarian and when she said it couldn't be done I believed her.
What problems did you run into during the initial process and how were you able to fix them ?
The Italian company I was coming over to help had to do their part before I could get the work visa from the US Consulate(the letter to the Ministero del Lavoro and the Nulla Osta). Harassing them from the US seemed to go nowhere. I finally came over and harassed them in person and they gave me the paperwork needed and then I returned to the States and received my work visa with no problem. Getting the Permesso di Soggiorno was another trick and I wasted two mornings in the Questure until someone from work called a friend and then everything has been smooth sailing ever since. Knock on wood!
How long have you been here?
I have been here exactly 3 years when I'm writing this.
What type of adjustment problems have you had?
I have had all kinds of adjustment problems. It's been very hard for me to learn the language as I'm an engineer and better with numbers and math than language skills. It doesn't help that the dialects here can be far from Italian. Also at work I was an private office for a long time at the beginning, which looking back is the wrong time to working by yourself or with only one other person. Later I was working and relating to a larger group at work and everything seemed to improve. Language, friends, even social life.
What do you wish someone had told you before you made the leap?
Make sure you are coming here with a passion for something in common with Italians. If you like baseball, NASCAR, and country music then you aren't going to find much to talk about with Italians. If you like Italian food, Formula 1, soccer, politics and other things like this then you will have limitless conversations and a good chance of "fitting in". I had soccer as an in but more common interests would have been better.
What inside secret could you pass on to others looking to move over?
It's not what you know, it's who you know. That's too easy... Also it's how long you are willing to argue. I've seen times where the person that is "right" is the person willing to argue the most.
Do you have any disappointments, things you thought would happen but haven't for whatever reasons ?
I thought Italians would be more open. Sure they are interested in you as a foreigner and may open up a little but to really be a part of their group takes years. Most my friends have been friends for years upon years so there really is no substitute for time. As a an American, patience is not always my strong subject. Also I'm disappointed I haven't found that beautiful Italian wife that everyone said I would find when I left the US. There's still time...
What has changed about you since you have been here ?
Too much to even mention. But I'm still basically the same person that is shy in unfamilar places and situations. It's just now there are much fewer unfamilar situations and places. I also think I have much more compassion for people trying to get into the US and more apprentation for my home country. I can now see that every country has flaws they try not to show the world. The US just can't hide theirs because there's too much interest in what it's doing. Like a rock star with the tabloids.
Do you think that you will stay forever?
This is the BIG question for me. It changes all the time. I go thru periods where I can't imagine leaving what I've grown accustomed to and then there I times I can't imagine not being able to hang out with my old friends and family.
Can you think of any other questions that should be added to this questionnaire?
What's particularly interesting to you about your region of Italy? I've seen and heard some major differences north to south and cities verses in the country. Italy has amazing differences when you think about how big it is

Nigella Lawson’s Cookbooks

Ron Paul’s campaign manager in 2008, Kent Snyder, died of pneumonia at age 49 (was it because he didn’t have health insurance due to a pre-existing condition and therefore didn’t to a hospital quickly enough?). Even though Snyder raised tens of millions for the campaign, Paul never provided PRIVATE health insurance for staffers.
Snyder died two weeks after Paul dropped his bid for the presidency in 2008. Paul hailed Snyder for convincing him to run, and said right after his death, “Like so many in our movement, Kent sacrificed much for the cause of liberty,”
It appears former Florida Rep. Alan Grayson was correct when he famously framed Republican “healthcare” that, “The Republicans want you to die quickly if you get sick.”

Drizzle. Grey. Those two words sum up the weather this weekend. So we were very happy to be invited to a brunch at our eldest daughter and son-in-law's home on Sunday after early church. Seven of us (including the Little Miss and her parents) gathered together in person and our youngest daughter and her husband joined us from Rome via Skype for a few fun moments.
Yellow daffodils shone brightly as we munched on huevos rancheros, bacon, English muffins, cinnamon buns and berry smoothies. It was the perfect way to spend a drizzly February afternoon.
I hope your weekend was equally fine. Joining with Mary of the Little Red House for Mosaic Monday.
Oh Yum, I want to come to your house for breakfast! Very tasty mosaic!

Ben MasonComments120
this wiki
Rebecca Mason (mother, deceased)
Hal Mason (older brother)
Matt Mason (younger brother)
[[:Category:{{{Images}}}|Images]]
Ben Mason is the middle child of the Mason family. Prior to the first season, he was captured by the invaders and harnessed. He is recaptured by the 2nd Massachusetts Militia Regiment at the beginning of the series and reassumes a prominant role in the resistance. Despite having the Harness removed, Ben continues to feel its residual effects.
StoryEdit
Sometime after the initial invasion while Tom and his family were getting ready to leave their house, Ben was over at his friend Nick's house, it is believed he was captured by the Skitters there and later harnessed. Months later while Hal is scouting a road, he notices Ben among a group of harnessed children, later reporting this to his father.(Live and Learn)
PersonalityEdit
Prior to the alien invasion, it is revealed that Ben Mason was a good student; he is refered to on several occasions as having been a "math geek." At the onset of the series, the effects of the harness have turned him into a semi-mindless drone working for the skitters.
The removal of the harness generally sees his return to a former self, albiet wearied from the effects of war and the death of his mother. Throughout the first season he maintains a lighter personality despite the darkness of the situation consuming the 2nd Mass. One of the major themes of the second season is Ben's personal transition into a darker and more serious character as a result of his growing anger and confusion.
Ben's personality changes drastically following the disappearence of his father at the end of season 1. The lack of a father figure allows Ben to step forward and take on the role of a fighter in the resistance. By the time that Tom Mason returns to the 2nd Mass, it is clear that Ben has lost the naivety that had been afforded by his fathers previous attempts to shelter him.
Additionally the mistrust and alienation that many among the 2nd Mass place in deharnessed children weighs heavily on Ben's character. This, and perhaps the growing psychological effects caused by the maturing harness, have caused him to seek solace in his own anger. This anger serves as his sole motivation for killing the enemy, and at times he has put himself and others at risk in order to satiate his desire to kill.
That said, Ben cares deeply about his family and friends. A prominant theme with his character is the struggle to understand the balance in his life between anger and love. While his anger drives him to kill, he is deeply upset for instance after the death of his friend Jimmy .
QuotesEdit
Killing
Weaver: What in hell were you two doing out there, Ben? Ben: Hunting skitters. Tom: What were you and Jimmy doing hunting skitters, Ben? Ben: They put spikes on my back, they killed mom, they killed everyone...I need a reason? Weaver: Like we don't see enough combat, you have to go looking for it? Ben: Till every last one of those things is dead...yes. (From: Season 2, Episode 3: Compass)
.
Anger
Ben: Wanna know my secret... to make sure they can't control me? Hate. I hate what they did to me with all my heart and soul. I hate that they turned me into a freak. Tom: You're not a freak. Ben: Better hold on to your hate dad. If you can do that, it doesn't matter what they've done to you. They won't be able to change you inside. Tom: You're right. Hate is a very powerful emotion. And I hate them too. But if all you've got left is hate, then they've already changed you. It wasn't my hate that kept me going the last couple months. It was my love. For you, and for Hal, and for Matt. Ben: Got to go... (From: Season 2, Episode 2: Shall We Gather at the River).
Physical ProwessEdit
Prior to the harness, Ben Mason never exercised and was noted to be physically underwhelming. The harness stimulates rapid growth in his body and following its removal, Ben has extraordinary strength and endurance. He is shown doing hundreds of pushups and jumping rope for several hours.
Hal notes that "Swimming across a river is nothing for Ben. Since those spikes, he can run for miles without breaking a sweat. He has ears like a jackrabbit and can see like a hawk."(Shall We Gather at the River, 10:56) He uses these abilities to become an accomplished figher for the 2nd Mass.
Ben can also pick up the radio waves that are used by Skitters to communicate. He uses this ability in season 1 to help the resistance jam skitter communication and fend off an oncoming attack.: I've seen the way everyone looks at me... Hal, Matt, even you. Tom: No. Ben: Yes. Tom: No. Ben: Fine, whatever. (From: Season 2, Episode 4 - Young Bloods)
Tom: There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish and prey that your mother was still alive. And it, um, sucks. It really sucks. Sometimes you think that you can't even go on. Except you don't have a choice but to go on. And the good news is that we have each other to get through a lousy situation. The bad news is that it's... Ben: It's a lousy situation. (From: Season 2, Episode 3 - Compass)."
WeaponsEdit
Ben Mason's weapon of choice in season 2 is a Heckler & Koch G36K
Put picture from here: [1]
Note: For detailed information on guns used in Falling Skies, go to IMFDB.
Role In Skitter UprisingEdit
Bens' role in the rebel skitter uprising is still relativly unknown however during the season Finale of Season 2 its revealed that Ben is Red Eye's goto guy not only for talking through him but having Ben make other humans understand the rebel skitters intents and purposes.
Its also shown breifly that Red Eye cares for Ben much like Tom cares for Ben. This is illustrated when Hal locates where the rebel skitters are holding out near the charelston compound and Red Eye confronts Hal by blocking the way to Ben. And also during Red Eye's death where he puts his arm around Ben as he dies and communicates to Tom to keep fighting.

TriviaEdit
- The first scripts gave Ben Mason a much smaller role in the series.

“Growing up, I was the only one around that didn’t have any grandparents. They were in Sweden and we never really talked about them.” So my father said, when I asked him for some information about his grandparents, all from Sweden. “I think you know more about it than I do, since you gave me the passenger lists.”
What a contrast in searching for my elusive Swedish origins from the wealth of information I have with my early New England ancestors with their well recorded histories. My father is the last of six children, as far as I know there are no other living relatives from that generation or before. Hopefully, I could get some information on his family’s history to help fill in my family tree.
So, we continued our phone conversation and I asked some specific questions. “Grampa’s father died years before he came here I think,” Dad said. That made sense. His mother’s name, Anna Larssen, was listed as the parent of Fritz Olsson on the passenger list. “What was Grampa’s father’s name,” I asked. “I don’t know, he never talked about that.”
“So what about Gramma? Her father’s name was Carl. What about her mother’s name?” I asked.
“You know more about it than me. I never knew what either of their parents names were.”
Frustrated, I supposed that even when mentioning their parents, and it sounded like they didn’t much, they probably wouldn’t have referred to them by their given names. OK, moving along.
Dad had given me me a family Bible that belonged to Grampa Olson with the name Karl Olsson in it. A relative? “Dad, did Grampa have a brother named Karl?”
“Karl. Yes, he worked for the railroad in Boston. And he was also a mason. He used to come stay over night with us sometimes on the weekends. He was married once, a long time ago, I think they had a son.”
It sounded kind of murky to me. I knew they didn’t talk much about things, I was gathering that the family had dissolved. Dad didn’t know the wife or child’s names. But now I knew that Grampa’s brother had immigrated, too.
“Gramma’s sister was Edith,” Dad offered. “Anderson. She lived in Watertown with Uncle Carl.” That was the third “Carl” in this conversation. At least I had the name of her husband now.
Dad was opening up. “They came to visit and spend the night, too. They had a daughter named Connie. And a daughter, Irma. You heard of Irma and Iva. We used to see them a lot. Iva Olson was Irma’s husband.”
“Olson?” I asked. Another Olson. No relation.
But I remotely recalled hearing some of these names as a child. I never realized Irma was Dad’s cousin. Or that he had cousins for that matter. But I suppose it made sense if my grandparents who immigrated had families of their own that their siblings also would.
“They had a son, Lewis. He lived in Newport, RI and then Florida. The last time I saw him was at Wally’s funeral (his brother),” Dad said.
I asked another question, expecting somewhat of a vague answer, but it was worth a try. “Was Edith older or younger than Gramma? Did they have any other siblings?”
“About the same age, more or less. I think it was just them.” Vague. But not all was lost.
As I jotted my notes down, I was recording a list of names. Relatives. Swedish relatives. My Swedish relatives. Are any of their children living? Could I possibly find them? Might they have some history to share that they learned from their parents? I do have a few cousins that I can perhaps interview and see if their parents, Dad’s older siblings, ever shared family history with them. I have talked to one of them who shared some little tidbits with me about Gramma’s homelife that she got firsthand. She also has the Olson photo album that I’m hoping to look at with her someday.
“Eric (my brother) showed me the picture of Grampa on the police force that you sent tohim,” Dad continued.
I’d found the photo on the Wrentham Police Force facebook page. “So that was definitely Grampa?” I asked. I was hoping it was, but no names were given.
“No mistaking that. He was on the force about 37 or 38 years.”
And you were a policeman too. “About 15 years. Worked 2 jobs then.”
“Eric emailed me the picture of you before you went into the Navy. It’s awesome. Brandon (my son) looks like you. Your about the same age.”
“The one with Gramma and Grampa. Pa’s in his police uniform in that one, too,” he said. What a great picture to have. I’ll ask him more about that time in his life another time. Gramma sure looks worried. But Dad did offer that he recently got together with some fellow veterans from his hometown for a special occasion and on Veteran’s Day they had a little ceremony on the common in front of the memorial which where his name is inscribed.
I don’t know as I’ve ever had such an interesting and meaningful conversation with my father. It’s not always easy to connect. To discover the bond of shared family history. My interest in Genealogy is opening doors that I never expected. Doors to family connections from the past and in the present.

Without a doubt, Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is one of
us. His taste may not be the greatest, as he has a framed
Marvel Age comic book on his wall, but he more than makes
up for that with the sheer volume of his collections. At
one point, he admits to having 47 G.I. Joes (we assume the
classic version) in their original packaging. For some,
he would seem to have a perfect life, but for one thing.
He is The 40-Year-Old Virgin.
Once that fact slips out, co-writer/director Judd Apatow
can get his plot rolling. To be fair to those that savor
structure, it's really not much of a plot, more a series
of black-out sketches detailing Andy's inner life and his
friends' struggle to get him in bed with a woman. But it
works, and manages to be both outrageous and low-key.
Building from a sketch set at a poker game, co-writer
Carell carefully explores his character but also gives his
co-stars plenty to work with. This is a hard film to explain,
as it has a pretty positive message but doesn't shy away
from just how gross guys can be when they hang out together.
And they are gross, in various states of arrested development
when it comes to women. Jay (Romany Malco) thinks of himself
as a true playa, advising Andy that he's got to set his
sights low so he can get some experience before finding
the woman he really wants.
Agreeing but with a different energy, Cal (Seth Rogen)
coaches Andy in seeming aloof and mysterious to bookstore
clerk Beth (Elizabeth Banks). It works, but not quite the
way Cal had intended.
Rounding out Andy's circle of friends, Paul Rudd turns
his confident persona on its ear as David. The guy may have
the healthiest attitude out of the three, but he's fixated
on a relationship he had two years earlier. The script is
smart enough to sneak in both sides of the story, too, for
good effect.
The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not a perfect comedy.
Though the laughs keep coming, a few scenes show the seams
of being tacked onto a sketch idea. Trish owns a "We Sell
It On eBay For You" store. Though such things do exist and
Carell and Apatow try to do something with it, the scene
set in that store ends up being weird and goes nowhere.
The concept works, as it provides a turning point for Andy.
When Trish suggests he sell his collection so he can open
a stereo store, it's not just Andy that freezes. The whole
audience does. Be warned that for just a moment, this is
a horror film.
Apatow hasn't quite adjusted to directing for the big
screen yet, either. The lighting has a flat feel more suited
to television, and many scenes are framed for the boob tube.
But he also has an incredible touch for capturing nuance,
as he showed in series like Freaks
and Geeks and Undeclared. Brilliant but slightly
offbeat actors like Carell, that can deliver funny but natural
cadences, need directors like Apatow.
And then there's the chest-waxing scene. Shot live, and
quite possibly with a hapless real-life beautician (she
can't decide if she's horrified or amused by the cursing
Carell throws at her), it may be the single most brilliant
comedy scene of the year.
In a movie with a lot of winners like that, it's easy
to forgive the flaws.

Back with Thursday Linkage
Due to the clean up to from the Great Flood of 2010, I wasn’t able to give you linkage on Tuesday and Wednesday, plus I had to postpone the recording of this week’s edition of the Sports Media Weekly Podcast. Things are slowly getting back to normal, but I’m going to be applying for disaster relief as will many Rhode Islanders. I’ll let you know how that goes, but driving to work today was quite the experience as Route 95 was shut down. Hopefully by this time next week, we can get back to operating at 100%.
Let’s do some links for you.

I’m happy to say that my niece is healthy, but it can happen to anyone so do what you can to give. Doesn’t have to be a lot. Every bit helps.
That does it for the links today.

Imperial Empire of Snowzerland
Snowzerland is an island in the Ninja Archipelago and is also an ever-expanding Imperialist empire. Due to the origins of the country's starting capita, Snowzerland has to pay its loan back to the USA and Freezeland in monthly increments. It is the capital island of the German States, which consists of Alemania, Osterreach, Lichenstien, and itself.
[edit]. He also started to take loans from the USA. The USA was happy to fund a new country, even if it was in the middle of nowhere..
[edit] Government
The Head of State and supreme leader is the Emperor. This is a hereditary title, the highest rank of nobility. The emperor has supreme power which he can use without any limits. Swiss Ninja holds the title emperor. The second in command is the Archduke of Snowzerland. The archduke is the second in command to the Emperor and also the Head of Government. The position is always hereditary but the Emperor.
The legislature consists of 10 representatives from each city, 1 whose the duke/duchess of the city while the others are elected to meet at the headquarters in Geneva. There is no upper or lower house, just the Snowzerland.
[edit] Cantons/Provinces
[edit] Mainland Snowzerland Cantons
[edit] Outside Provinces
[edit] Former Territories
- Southwest Slumolia - Liberated during the Giant Swiss-Terrain Cookie War.
- Frankterre - Liberated by the USA at the beginning of the Great Snowzerland War V.
- Alemania (Holyswissia) -
Liberated by the USA also during the Liberation of Holyswissia campaign-It was later reannexed back into Snowzerland in 2011.
- Batavia - Declared independance from Snowzerland in 2011. They decided that Snoss rule was unnecessary.
[edit] Lichenstien
Lichenstien is a small island east of Snowzerland Island itself. It was colonized in 2008 by the Snoss and has been a Snoss possetion ever since. Lichenstien's official language is German, and all of the first settlers of Lichenstien were eather of Snoss, Osterrean, or Alemanian origin. Because of it's small size, Lichenstien is highly dependant on Snowzerland and Osterreach for manufactured goods, textiles, and technology. Lichenstien is mainly a farming community, and it's small villages and towns also have some small specialties like woodworking and Cream Soda production as well. It is a member of the German States like the motherland.
A map of Lichenstien. Click to enlarge.
[edit] Military
See The Royal Army of Snowzerland.
If you want to see the Secret Agency of Snowzerland, see the SSS.
[edit].
[edit] Relationships with Other Nations/Provinces
- United States of Antarctica - Very poor. The USA is tired of SN not paying his loan back and SN wanted to conquer the USA. Their relations broke down completely in the GSWV, when the USA attempted to nuke Snowzerland.
- TerraMount - EXTREMELY poor. TerraMount is sick of constant wars started by The Imperial Empire of Snowzerland. They are always in a cold war in between those wars and during those cold wars there is the occasional proxy war.
- MAI - Fair. MAI has trade with Snowzerland, but stated that it is not impressed that Swiss Ninja has conquered countries, even going as far as saying THEY should conquer Snowzerland if Swiss continues! Other than this argument, MAI praises Snowzerland from its environmental record to the beauty of the mountains.
-.
- Valnordore - Mixed..
- Ed Island - Very poor. Tensions between Snowzerland and Ed Island have escalated in the past few years.
- arminh against them. The weapons are actually for West Pengolia.
- Maverick - EXTREMELY poor. Snowzerland has made several sneak attacks against little islands, leading to a bitter rivalry between the countries. Maverick is rumored to have begun development of weapons of mass destruction to stop this.
- Dorkugal - Poor. Ever since Malcur ran them over, the nerds have begun to be paranoid of every military power except the USA.
- New North Etana - Poor. Since Snowzerland has openly threatened Japaland at least once in the past few years, they have begun to be distrustful of the Snoss. Japaland ceded itself to NNE in 2009, fearing that the Snoss would roll over them.
- Japaland - EXTREMELY poor. Swiss Ninja has openly considered taking Japaland off the map, partially because of all the rednecks, and partially because they are an unbelivably industrial nation. They also scare him, becuase that technology is mixed with conservative, pro-war views from the rednecks, a sense of unity from the Asian aspect of the country, and a work ethic better than anything else because of both cultures combined. It's a good thung that Japaland is forbidden from having a military. In the 1910s, they had better weapons than the Naughtzee.
- Castilla - Very poor. Castilla claims that it was the "original" Snowzerland and both countries share a strong competitiveness. As much as Snowzerland dreams to Germanify Antarctica, Castilla wishes to Hispanify Antarctica.
- Yow Kingdom - Poor. Though the 2 countries hate the USA. As King Alexander the ruler of Yow Kingdom wishes to destroy the island and be the penguin to bring down the USA.
- Lisboagal- Decent. They are allies and trading partners, only because Snowzerland hates Dorkugal too.
- Rusca- Bad. The Ruscans and Snoss have nukes pointed at each other in fear that one will invade the other.
[edit] Culture
The Culture of the Snoss is slighly different in different provinces.
[edit] a rare, and is not eated.
[edit] Clothes
Zurich is known for its fashion, and most penguins there are very avid to the latest styles. Hovever, some areas that are more rural and have more poverty tend to wear European peasant clothes.
[edit].
[edit].
[edit].
[edit] Media
See Snoss Television for more Information.
Most Cantons in Snowzerland have their own individual newspaper, usually called "city den it's Propaganda.
[edit] Economy
The Economy of Snowzerland is divided into four sections:Agriculture, Services, INdustry, and Tourism.
[edit].
[edit] Services
[edit].
[edit] Tourism
Snowzerland focuses a lot on tourism, especially since Swiss Ninja wants his nation to look better than all the others. Public Transport like Airports, Buses, Taxies, and Trains.

Sort of a "game over" sequence! Were you relieved to be a Cylon, or were you wanting to be the underdog and fight it out?
Regarding: "Callie moves to Command where both Helo & I are located, and proceeds to execute…me! Callie uses her second action to reveal."
Unless you mean Callie was alread there… its "Move and Action", or "Action and Second Action", not both!
Callie is the coolest support character just for the almighty "I will kill you" power…hehe. "If you choose option x, I will come over there and kill you on my turn."
Without Signature
You're right, Callie must have just revealed on her turn maybe. I assume Gaius tried to Brig her but didn't succeed perhaps. I was sort of disappointed to be the Cylon, partially because being the Sympathizer is so unsatisfying, and because I was looking forward to the Admiralty. At least with the Cylon Fleet board there is more for the Sympathizer to do. I think humans could have won if I hadn't drawn the Sympathizer, but as it went they didn't have much hope.

FFG has clarified that "counts as a hero" only applies for attacks, hero abilities and Overlord cards that target "heroes." In particular, they have said, this means you can't "trade items" (ie: give equipment to) an NPC treated as a hero.
Ronan's hero ability says that any hero may give Pico to another hero "following the rules for trading items." This is a hero ability, which implies it ought to work for Sir Palamon, but the normal trading items rules are prohibited for such NPCs (according to FFG). The NPC does count as a hero for this ability, but only if he does something FFG has said he can't do.
I'm pretty sure the end result is that you can't give Pico to an NPC like Sir Palamon.

by Professor Wagstaff
Wagstaff Still Alive (Barely)
The first week of the McGee Survivor League went almost
precisely as the Professor expected as both girls, Team Minnesota and S.F. Col’s Guys finished atop the point standings by wide margins. The only prediction that went awry was that I actually survived the first week; much to my surprise. I did, however, manage to finish in the bottom three as my own “Wide Receivers before Running Backs” draft strategy blew up in my face. Could someone in Houston please inform Andre Johnson that the season has actually started? We said good bye to Team Lunz, as our nephew and cousin, Jim, failed to get out of the starting blocks. One down, twelve to go.
No Defense for the Defense
It was an interesting Week 1 as far as DST’s were concerned. No sooner than four teams considered to have solid defenses lost one of their top players for a large chunk, if not all, of the season. Troy Palumalo (Steelers) and Jerod Mayo (Patriots) could each be out for as long as six weeks with knee injuries while Brian Urlacher (Bears/wrist) and Joe Blow (Jaguars/knee) have been lost for the season. Keep them in mind as you set your lineup this weekend.
* * * * *
Fantasy Football Stars
Based on how well the Bucs ran the ball against the Cowboys last weekend, RB Brandon Jacobs should have a big night in Dallas; especially with Eli Manning still adjusting to life without Plaxico Burress… Atlanta’s RB Michael Turner should start to justify that #2 pick you spent to get him with a big game against a weak Panthers’ D Line… Speaking of weak lines, the Rams may own the worst in the league on each side of the ball. That’s why we love Skins’ RB Clinton Portis to run all over them and the Redskins’ DST to completely dominate.
Fantasy Football Stiffs
Could things be worse for QB Jay Cutler? His Chicago debut was marred by four INT in a loss to Green Bay, and now he faces the Super Bowl champs in the home opener. If the Steelers shut down the run, (when don’t they?), Cutler could be good for another couple of picks… If Jake Delhomme doesn’t have a solid first half against Atlanta, the Panthers’ QB may find himself on the bench. Based on their performance vs. Miami, the Falcons don’t figure to allow DeAngelo Williams a lot of freedom, putting even more pressure on Delhomme to come up big… If you hadn’t figured they’d be here based on our Stars report, we give you the Rams’ DST… A solid Vikings’ defense and the Lions propensity for falling behind make RB Kevin Smith a huge risk this week.
Fantasy Football Sleepers
Last year, the Cardinals allowed more TD passes than they threw and were a disaster on the road. That’s why the Professor moved QB David Garrard into his starting lineup this week… With the Jets shooting their mouths off this week, you have to figure they’ll focus a lot of their attention on New England’s Randy Moss; which should allow WR Wes Welker to have a big game… The Vikings should have no trouble throwing the ball against the Lions, who allowed 6 TD passes vs. Drew Brees in New Orleans last week. Look for TE Visanthe Shiancoe to reel in a TD from Brett Favre among his 8 REC… All of a sudden, the Ravens seem to have taken the shackles off of QB Joe Flacco, who threw for 300 YDS last Sunday. He’ll have another big game vs. San Diego…
Fantasy Football Slippers-
Bears’ RB Matt Forte will struggle vs. the Steelers; especially if Jay Cutler turns in another stinker… Have to be worried about Chargers’ QB Philip Rivers. He may be without LaDainian Tomlinson and two of his offensive linemen with the vaunted Ravens’ defense coming to town… I know you used a pretty high pick on Rams’ RB Stephen Jackson but it may be time to move him. The Rams look terrible, especially the O Line, and Jackson will struggle all year… Did you pick up Jets’ QB Mark Sanchez this week? Good. Now, wait at least another week to put him in your lineup as Pats’ coach Bill Bellichick will make life difficult for the rookie on Sunday.

At peak cherry blossom time in Washington, D.C., I risked life, limb and vehicle damage to venture into our nation's capital city. Making it unscathed to the National Mall, I breathed a long sigh of relief. I looked forward to revisiting the wonderfully familiar monuments and records of our great heritage. The cherry and tulip trees were in full bloom, posing for multitudes of camera-toters. After wheeling into one of the few-remaining public parking lots deep beneath the Holiday…Continue Reading

It doesn't take much driving across Kansas to notice there is a serious drought in progress.

The room was being emptied for something new. I dumped files, photographs, cameras, perfume bottles, books, CDs, everything that the draws vomited out in bags. And then I had to find space for those bags. Some are held precariously on stools, some against walls, some inside cupboards dumped over clothes. It all seems senseless because when I open those bags I won't know what to find where. I do not understand the purpose behind emptying anything when you merely change gears or move on or shift. Where is the emptiness?
The room looked crowded with walls and the ceiling and the wardrobe and the forlorn desk with the PC covered like a delightful secret behind a lacy cover. I lay down on the bed and wanted to feel light. I could not. Those bags in various places haunted me. Today I needed the cheque book. I looked and looked and found it in one of those hold-alls clinging to some cable wire. I wonder what was being connected.
The day arrived for the fresh layers of paint and no one turned up. No one wanted to do anything to my room. And when he arrived rather late, I said forget it. But I did not replace anything. I liked to see the painting behind the dining table…it is of a woman with a faraway look. Now she is propped against a chair getting the whiff of food under the weight of glass. I think she will leap out and hit her head against it. I could be wrong. I often am.
Last night my table fan that was propped up on the CPU fell. It broke. Its blades whirred with a Jarring sound before it gave up. I tried yanking at the wire near its neck, but it only snaked out further. It was a very un-fan like thing to do. I poked my fingers into the mesh to see if it would move; it made guttural noises.
It lies there now and won’t work. Heat smiles. Filling in.
Nothing was emptied.

You cannot get any thing new without you first throwing out old
I have old clothes, old shoes, old books, old friends...and then the new...??
Throwing out old clothes I can understand due to the hazards of slow-motion corpulence or just wear and tear. But do be aware that if you throw out your old friends, you are unlikely to find any new ones of the same quality the older you get. I never throw out any books that I bothered to acquire in the first place -- perspectives never go out of fashion just because the world changes.
Al:
When did I say I throw out old friends? They are far too heavy! I was in fact responding to KB that you do not need to...the new comes as new. I agree about perceptions; it isn't only that the world changes but even the perception of the perception does.
FV, was not insinuating anything about you -- apologies if it sounded like that. Apologies to you and kb for intruding. I was just saying it myself on reading what you wrote, should have made that clear. Just random thoughts.
FV: "I agree about perceptions; it isn't only that the world changes but even the perception of the perception does."
True. One has to know oneself well to differentiate when the world changes compared to when one's perception of the world changes due to new thought processes.
Al:
No problems.
A matter of perception!

Neutrals are an integral part of every girls wardrobe due in part to the fact that they can mix and match with almost every item in your closet including each other. Colors are fun and indeed an essential, but without a few key neutral pieces, you'll continually find yourself surrounded by bright colors that lack basic styling links, which will leave your wondering why you have nothing to wear. By properly stocking your wardrobe with a few neutral pieces your styling options will instantly double. If you’re a color fiend you can think of these pieces as the perfect canvas for showing off one of your prized bright colored pieces such as a neon pink scarf or a mint green clutch. When styling your neutral ensembles I always suggest adding some contrast and dimension by incorporating tonal textures like eyelet shorts or a crochet vest. Khaki, cream, white, blush, brown, black, and grey are a few of the most popular neutrals..
Below are some of my favorite neutral pieces that are perfect for incorporating into your summer wardrobe:
1. Pleated Top 2. Sheer Maxi Skirt 3. Embroidered Scarf
Absolutely love this look!!

I like the idea of creating contrast by buying textured neutrals. I think crochet and lace are awesome textures to have in a neutral color as they spice up any wardrobe. Thanks for the tips!
so cute sweetheart!
I just love the skirt!
The skirt is to die for! And I've been wearing my hair the same way! It's my favorite quick, stylized hair do!

Absolutely adorable outfit. I want to wear it!

I think neutrals are quite essentials. Since I have red hair, I like something that complements it, with a hint of peach rather than just beige.
I love your bun!
Love,

You must have the most rad closet! Love the neutrals with the turquoise pop of color in the ring.
I completely agree with your advice! I LOVE my neutrals....maybe a little too much in fact! haha. But I love the pieces you've shown and love adding in accent colors with jewelry like you often do :)

Pants that ride up, sleeves that hang down, waists that pinch, hems that fall short, size 8s that fit differently from label to label.
Did you think it was just your body that was impossible to fit?
According to Stores.org, $28 billion a year of merchandise is returned to stores because of poor fit.
An informal poll on this site shows that 42% never find clothes to fit; 40% only sometimes; 14% said rarely and only 4% said always.
But you really don't care about statistics and projections: you already know that it's almost impossible to find great fit.
The real reason is pretty simple: there's no standardization in women's sizes. A U.S. size 4 could be an 8 or a 2 depending on the maker.
There is a very basic guideline for fit based on a 60-year-old study done by the US Dept. of Commerce.
Unfortunately, the 2,000 women who were measured for that study were mostly young, unmarried, white women according to Ellen Goldsberry, associate professor with The University of Arizona Division of Retailing and Consumer Studies on the university's web site.
That cross-section doesn't begin to touch on the diversity of today's demographics.
Also, this old data is out-of-sync with the way women have increased in size: in 1941 the average woman was 5' 2", 129 pounds. Today she is 5' 4" and weighs 144 lbs (wearing between a 12 and 14).
Another reason clothes never fit is that most sizes are based on the assumption that women's bodies are hourglass in nature. (Ex: A size 8 a the Gap is a 36 bust-28 waist -36 hips.) In reality, the average woman's body is much more a pear shape (smaller on top and heavier through the hips).
To make matters even more confusing, factor in the inane sizing system itself. "Missy" sizes (2-20) originally designated age, not measurements.
And the sizes themselves keep fitting bigger.
Unfortunately, this means that if you have always worn a size 10, you've actually grown by as much as 5" in the bust and waist over the past 30 years.
The good news is that technology, such as 3D body scanners to capture accurate measurements, will improve data gathering about the population's true size.
And mass customized products that allow you to tweak sizes to fit your own measurements are already an online reality.

Lady Gaga's promise to only wear Versace for two months gets off to a flying start with her video for 'The Edge of Glory'.
BY Belinda White | 17 June 2011
Move over Mugler, Lady Gaga has a new fashion obsession. Gaga-philes have spotted that the eccentric singer has been clocking up a fair few appearances in vintage Versace of late, even telling one interviewer that she's only going to be wearing Versace for the next two months. Well, of course that's not strictly true - one designer alone cannot feed the Gaga's voracious appetite for fashion - but she's trying, wearing vintage Versace throughout her latest music video which debuted last night in the US.
In pictures: Lady Gaga's eccentric outfits
The Edge of Glory sees our heroine parading around a generic New York street clouded with dry ice, and variously hanging off the fire escape and dangling out the window of an apartment block dressed in a variety of Versace looks straight out of the label's Nineties heyday.
Lady Gaga makes catwalk debut at Paris Fashion Week."
Lady Gaga calls Anna Wintour a 'b****'
It's a rather more pared-back version of Gaga vision in comparison to her previous mega-budget promos for tracks like Telephone and Judas , which feature endless costume changes and a cast of thousands. Gaga's only friend in The Edge of Glory is saxophone player Clarence Clemons of Bruce Springsteen's E Street band, who is currently in hospital after suffering a stroke on June 12.
Confusion reigns over who actually directed the video, with reports that Gaga fired original director Joseph Kahn after he denied directing the video for her last single, Judas . In answer to fans questions, Kahn posted on his Twitter page "I did NOT direct Lady Gaga's Edge of Glory video. Lady Gaga did."
The official credit goes to "Haus of Gaga", but perhaps there should have been a special thank you to the directors of classic Nineties sitcom, Friends. The video bears more than a passing resemblance to Phoebe Buffay's ill-fated video for Smelly Cat, with Gaga's Versace outfit an homage to Phoebe's backing singers.

Natalie Portman has been named the new look for the line of Christian Dior perfumes. Although time has not revealed what perfume will lend his image, it will Portman's first time leading a campaign for cosmetics and perfumes.
It strikes me this election because the actress Israeli strikes me as the image of the French firm, because if we compare with other faces of actresses that have been image as Sharon Stone, Charlize Theron and Monica Bellucci, the face of good Portman choice is completely opposite to the above. Do not you think?
And this picture, but judging from last night Awards A FI (Life Achievement Award) where the actress was spectacular with a look of "good girl" with a stick pink gown by Christian Dior.
A point design sweetheart neckline depth and Resort Collection 2011. I combined with some shoes in the same tone that I like and a beautiful black and white clutch with a bow front. Without doubt, was one of the most eleganates night.

**Edit: Names! Hello, William (Will) Matthew & Peyton James Jolly :)**
Kimberly sent us these photos from her phone -- they look so much like infant Emma!
The twins...
Emma at about 5 months
We're so happy to announce that, at 1:21 PM today,2 Jolly boys joined the family. They weigh 7 lb 15 oz and 5 lb 11 oz, and both Mom Kimberly and babies are doing great. Dad was on hand to give them each the right names (he insisted they couldn't be named just on the order they arrived alone, and he's probably right), and now Emma is one proud big sister! We can't tell you their names yet, but we will as soon as we know them!
Now we gotta have a giveaway for an occasion this momentous and life-changing! Comment on this post and tell us one of your life-changing moments, or a piece of advice for a family that suddenly has 3 little ones!
The prize? Well, two Fat Quarter Bundles, of course (get it, bundles of joy? Ha-ha?) We'll randomly pick 2 winners who get to choose a Fat Quarter Bundle of their choice.
We'll be posting photos soon! In the meantime, I'll use this as a placeholder :)

Congratulations...wow, two bundles of joy! My biggest life-changing events were the births of my two little ones. Life-changing for the better. And my advice, don't nap when the babies are sleeping: SEW!
no experience with twins so good luck but we do have three kids under 5. You go from being able tag team to needing to be in midst of triange type upkeep 24/7.
So my only advice is to take your vitamins (especially with two boys, I have two as well) and get as much rest as they'll give you.
Congrats. I'm old, so I'm had many life changing moments. One that's funny is when we were empty nesters, not retired yet, and our 21 year old called and said she was moving home!, and wasn't going to pay rent!, because she was going to save every penny to by a house. Oh, was that a shocker. Well she did, and she did.
Congratulations. Twins would certainly be life changing. Getting married was pretty life changing for me, with many more changes to come. Good luck.
Congratulations to all! So glad to hear everyone is healthy, safe and sound. Can't wait to see the pictures of the whole family!
Congratulations! I would have to say that having children is the one event that is the most life changing. Wait - you mean, eat somewhere other than BK or McDonalds? My "little ones" are now 19 and 21, and rarely do I STILL every go anywere but there! :)
Congrats to the whole family! I don't have kids (yet), so thus far, the biggest life changing even has been getting married, which has been great!
Congratulations! Glad to hear everyone is doing well. Emma certainly looks happy. The birth of my daughter was life-changing for me - suddenly, complete responsibility for another person. And it has been wonderful, rewarding, enjoyable - all good things!
Congratulations to all, but esp the big sister! Her world will never quite be the same... I don't think anything has changed my life as much as my 2 children- and they're not even twins!
Wow--three young kids! My biggest life changing event so far has been getting married--I'm sure I will change that when I start having kids though.
Congratulations!!! My life changing life event would have to be my wedding last year. I'm sure that will be trumped once we have kids, but not yet.
Multiples run in my DHs family, and our neighbors had twin boys too, and everyone always says take lots of photos and videos because it's going to be so crazy hectic that you won't remember the first year at all. You'll cherish those memories later on.
Congratulations! I can't believe I happened to pop into the blog at this moment! Truly a life changing event for me was beginning to teach my quilting class. I had no idea how it would transform me, and how it would build my confidence. The resulting self-assured me has been able to weather difficult situations and a job change more easily. Have fun with the little ones and thanks for having this giveaway!
Oh my....double the joy!!! So many things come to my mind about how life alters, but meeting my husband and the joy of our life together is the first thing that comes to mind.
Congrats to the BIG sister. XXX Annelies
Find a good calendar system, whether it's an online one both parents can log into/download to phones/outlook or a wall or desk calendar... One of those that has a separate line per family member as you will have to many appts to coordinate and now some even have lines to add your menu that you can coordinate how much/what you want to cook based on your days activities and then you take that weeks calendar/menu to have to only go to the store once for the week... Hopefully this is clearer than mud! Congrats!
Congratulations to you all! I definitely agree that having my two children have been the most life-changing events for me. :)
Congratulations! My life changing event happened just less than 3 months ago upon the arrival of our first daughter, Lily. Advice? Let big sis help; she'll love it, and the help will be nice, too!!! Again, congrats to the whole family! Enjoy every second!
Congratulations! My life changing moment was having my twins, my first childrem and my world dramatically changed. My advice is take one day at a time and every day it will get easier. 3 children will bring so much love and joy!
My absolutely most life changing event was becoming the mother of a teenager...my new husband's lovely daughter! It is now six years later and I cannot even imagine life without her!
Oh wow, two babies , I only had one, and that was live changing, so with two it'll be an even bigger change?? ;-))It'll be busier for sure.
Congatulations!!!
Congratulations! Advice? I'd just say, don't sweat the small stuff. Let it roll off you. Less stress that way! Oh, a get lots of sleep. (Hmmm, wishful thinking probably!)
emma is quite an adorable placeholder!! but i do look forward to seeing the boys! life changing.. probably when i bought my house... and my tip is take one thing at a time.. people try and make it everything they thought they ever wanted all at once and it is much less stressful to do one room at a time... as for kids... i think the same could work... try and take one thing at a time... or two in this case!!
A HUGE congrats to the new parents and big sister. I just recently had twins (3.5 months old, our numbers 3&4) and the biggest advice I could give is to take one day at a time! Don't worry about everything else that is going on.
Do what you can at the same time (feeding/changing diapers), that way it is more like taking care of one baby. It took me a little bit to figure out the tandem feeding, but it works GREAT! I don't spend near as much time feeding. If one wakes up at night I make sure the other one gets up also to eat, that way I can sleep a little more.
Let big sisters feel needed and helpful. Sleep when your little ones sleep. LET PEOPLE HELP. That is always a hard one for me. I hate having other clean my house, but LET THEM!
Enjoy!!! This is such a wonderful time and although it may seem a little overwhelming right now, it gets better. I would totally have twins again. Congrats again, I am so happy for you all!
Wow-twins would be great! I guess my life-changing moments were when my kids were born & when they each got married! The empty nest was a little different, but I have grown to love it!
Congrats on the TWINS. Since I'm not a mom myself - the life changing moments for me are the births of my 7 nieces and nephews. Most of them have quilts made with Fat Quarter Shop Fabric. My advise is get as much sleep as you can. :-)
So glad everyone is happy and healthy. So amazing to add to your family and even more blessed with twins. I would have to say life changing for me was 3 1/2 years ago, leaving my job to start my own photography business, so scary and exciting at the same time, but so worth it. Good luck in the coming days and try to enjoy. Take Care!
Heartiest Congratulations!!! My life changing event was recently retiring... a far cry from what is on your doorstep, but trust me, equally as joy filled!!
LindaSonia (baddabinda@yahoo.com)
Probably so many people's life changing moments will center around just a few life events... mine isn't very unusual. It was meeting my husband. At nearly-28 I was reading books with titles like "Singled Out" and "The Godmother" and finding ways to reconcile the prospect of lifelong singlehood with my lifelong dream of being married and having a family. Maybe accepting that possibility was what Fate was waiting for, because right around that time I had a first date with a tall, handsome, talkative man who quizzed me hard about commitment, children, and sharing breakfast cereal. Though we now tell ourselves that we didn't "think it was so" till the fourth date, I surely did think that he was the first real possibility from the very first...
Congratulations!! That is wonderful. For me most of my life changing events seem to be centered around my 5 children. I didn't have any twins but I have some friends who have. My advice would be to take things a day a time and try not to get too stressed about keeping the house clean or having the dishes done all the time. Those things can wait. Just hug & love on those babies!
Congrats! As a mother of little ones very close together get used to hearing..."Wow, you've got your hands full!" or "You are very busy". Anyway, it is great. Take it one day at a time and take any help you can get. That was my mistake, trying to do everything myself. Congrats again!
Congratulations!!! I don't have any kids but here's my shot at some advice: never underestimate the restorative power of a good nap, a good cry, or a good laugh (sometimes you need all three).
Congrats to the entire Jolly family. =) Those are really nice sized babies for twins! My advice is to make sure Kimberly remembers to take care of mommy. ;-)
Congratulations! One of my life changing moments was twelve years ago today when I married my husband. Who knew then all the things we would go through and how hard we would always have to work to be a team. It has been a great twelve years though and I can't wait to see what the next twelve hold in store.
Congrats!
As the mommy to two under two, my only advice is to seek the joy in each day. When you are covered in poo, babies and are so tired you can't see straight - remember the joy you have right in front of you.
Congratulations times two on the birth of two little precious ones! So wonderful! As far as the caring for two new babies plus little Emma, I would say remember to take care of yourself so you can take care of them. This might look like accepting the help and support of friends and family. Also, prioritize what is the most important for each day! Have fun!
Congratulations!! I'm guessing that with 2 this advice would go double ... Sleep when they sleep!
Can't wait to see pictures!
Wow!!! Congratulations!!!! It was most amazing when my first little girl was born! After having 2 boys, plus 2 stepsons, I wanted a little girls SOOO badly. The ultrasound tech had said she couldn't tell for sure but that little thing there looked like it might be a boy. We were ecstatic when she was born and we were told she was a girl. Words can't describe the joy I felt! Now another girl and another boy later, my life is so full, and so complete! My advice is to remember that everything that needs to get done today will likely still be there tomorrow, so enjoy the time with those little guys!!!
Congratulations, congratulations!! What wonderful news! Can't wait to hear the names and see pictures.
As a mom of twins, my advice is to have Kimberly join your local Moms of Multiples group ASAP. Meeting other moms who've been there, done that (or were going through it at the same time!) saved my life. It is HARD work initially, but so worth it. My twins are now 4.5 and are the best of friends.
Congratulations, twins boys, wow, very exiting.
Like the other mums my biggest life changing events were the birth of my 2 chilred (23 &21 next week).
I am going to echo the advise that you take any help offered. My niece is the mother of 8 month old twins and a 2 & 4 year old. She wanted to prove she can do it all herself and fell in a big heap and still struggles big time everyday despite the offer of help. I also think take one day at a time and rest as much as you can when the boys are sleeping. Have a specific play box for your daughter that she only plays with at the twins feed time including possibly her own baby.
All the best. I am very much looking forward to seeing pics.

My life never changed, so here's my advice for the Jolly family with THREE little ones: take-out, nannies, housekeepers, Mommy's Day Out, Daddy's Day Out, earplugs ... wait, just kidding on that last one - I think!
Congratulations to Kimberly and Kevin on this blessed event! Miss Emma is going to be a dynamite big sister! xo
Oh! How exciting. Congratulations to all the Jollys.
My advice would be to enjoy every minute of everyday. Their childhoods will pass in the blink of a eye and you will wonder how it could be over so quickly. CONGRATULATIONS to you ALL!!!!1
Congratulations! My biggest life changing events were definitely the births of my two daughters! Can't top that in my book :-)
Everyone's had great advice so far - sleep when you can, take all the help you can get. But also know when to say No. The babies don't belong to anyone else, and ultimately it's the parents who make the decisions. Don't let anyone else completely take over!
Congratulations to Kimberly and the whole family!
I can imagine what you´re all going trough. My life-chaging experience was also when my 2 twin-boys were born. They are already turning 13 this month, nut I still vividly remember when they were born :)
Adbie, from a twin´s mum: nurse them at the same time when they are newborns, and and feed them at the same time still when they are older. That will save you precious time to spen with your babies! on the new additions. My life-changing event was marrying into a family of 6 children. Flexibility and love without limits will take you to wonderful places.
Kathie L from Allentown
Congratulations! I had a friend with twin boys and they brought her so much joy! Being a newlywed I don't have that much advice, but I certainly have lots of well wishes!
Well, I have no children, so I can't give you any advice on that! :) Life changing moment..Hmm...I guess it would have to be when my nephew was born. He was so tiny and fragile. Made me realize just how fragile life is. He's a strapping 16 (almost 17) year old now!
Sandy A in St. Louis
How wonderful. Congratulations! My advice is don't worry about the little things. Slow down. If you don't accomplish everything you want to do today, it is okay. Take time to enjoy what you did accomplish. Tomorrow will be a brand new start.
Congrats on the boys!! My biggest life changing moment happened 17 years ago when my son was born. I was 40... I thought I had surgery to prevent pregnancy, but alas it didn't work!! LOL I guess the laugh was on me...
Congratulations on the birth of your twin boys. I know you will have your hands full.
Congratulations! Hold them close and love them lots. Enjoy them they grow up so fast.
Congratulations! Can't wait to find out their names. I don't have any children but I'm thinking the best advice is to make sure to give Emma attention as well. Sometimes the new babies get all the attention. I'm sure Emma is going to be a good little helper. Oh yeah, do the boys have red hair too or is it too early to tell?
Congratulations!!! I can't wait to see pictures of them. Biggest life changing moment would have to be sons birth. It's when I became a MOM!
What great news!! My advice is to love and appreciate every moment with them. It may not seem like it now, but they really do grow up so fast.
Congratulations to you all!
I could hardly go to bed before seeing the next twitt from"Almost time".
My life changed when I was born,went abroad the first time,got married, and everyday!
Please enjoy every minute with your new family.
I can't wait to see the pictures!
Well that's wonderful news! Congradulations everyone, especially big sister. What a wonderful picture that is. Can't wait to see pictures of all 3 siblings. Good going!
Congratulations-how wonderful!
Congratulations! Having twin boys was definitely my most life changing event. They will turn 29 next month and are still amazing me all the time.
My best advice is sleep whenever you can, don't worry about housework and don't turn down any offer of help no matter how small. Oh, and have fun!
Such exciting news, glad to hear things went smoothly! Only advice I can possibly offer is to keep a sense of humor as best as possible for those first few months and try to remember it will get easier for everyone before you know it! I hear the second time around it is a little easier to appreciate how tiny they are knowing how fast it all goes. Best of luck!!
Congratulations! Two wonderful bundles of joy must be so much fun! My biggest life-changing experience would have to be the emergency c-section of my youngest child. Thankfully, I had a wonderful doctor and was truly blessed---everything turned out fine!
Wow!!! That's fantastic news for me today. You have made my day.... Congrats to Kim, Kevin and Emma on having two little treasures to add to their family. My greatest live changing moment or moments - giving birth to our beautiful four children!! They are now 18, 17, 15 and 9 and are fabulous. Too add a fat quarter bundle to my stash would be heaven.....Best wishes, Cheryl, Brisbane, Australia
Congratulations! Of course my 2 kids were life changing, but another significant event was giving in to the kids and getting a dog. Who knew I would become a dog person?! It was a wonderful expanding event in our family.
Wishing you all the best!
Please enter me in the drawing.
OMG look at that gorgeous redhead...I could eat her up!!!
I hope the 2 boys are as cute as her!!!
Having children is in my experience enough of a life altering experience as any....but the most rewarding!
Peggy in NJ
I can't imagine twins! I wish the Jolly family lots of love and sleep!
I have always wanted hair that beautiful coppery orange color. What a gorgeous big sister!
Many congratulation to Kimberly and her family, the birth of twins is both amazing and daunting at the same time (twin girls aged 5 here so I know where you are coming from). Big sister looks so happy...and somewhat overwhelmed (not one but TWO brothers???) but she will be an amazing helper. My biggest hint has already been said, take it one day at a time. And of course, take some extra time with Emma, I know our oldest had a hard time with us dealing with the twins and I finally had to step back and realize that she was feeling lonely. We started having our Mommy and Me dates, we would go out for lunch and she would get to pick what we did, just her and I or just her and dad. We still continue it to this day and its brought our family together in such a great way.
Families are such a blessing, congrats again :)

Congratulations! I admit the jump from 1 to 2 was harder than adjusting to 1 so I can only imagine a jump to 3---you're outnumbered!
My advice? Mix it up! While routine and structure is necessary to a child so is a little non-routine. Eat dessert first. Picnic on the living room. Stay in your pajamas all day and watch movies together. My boys accept the routine of every day knowing that on occasion we throw it all away!
Now you'll realize that we need more fabric lines for boys!
Congratulations!!!
no multiples for me but I do have 4 daughters, and my advice is to cherish each and every day, find humor and enjoy the gift you've been given. Also housework always waits, children grow up so quickly, this weekend my oldest married her sweetie it seems like yesterday she was playing barbies.
Oh YEA! Two sweet baby boys...and from their weights it sounds like are nice and healthy! That truly is wonderful news. There is nothing like a new baby, and lucky you gets TWO!! I can imagine it will take time to adjust to your new big family, but treasure each and every moment. It goes by too quickly.
One of my biggest life-changing moments was this past December when I quit my job in order to pursue a more creative career! Thanks for the giveaway!
Congrats!!!! Wow, three little ones. I haven't had one of those great life changing events yet, but my best life changing even was when my niece was born. Even though she's 3000 miles away, she's still MY niece. Congrats again, keeps lots of diapers on hand.
Congrats on the birth of the twins! I saw this quote on a blog today and it said, "Keep calm and carry on". I think this is appropriate! And enjoy them, the'll be grown before you know it!

Congrats to the happy family! Since I have no little ones of my own, I would say that some of my biggest life-changing moments were when my nephews were born. Who knew a heart could grow so big so quickly?
Congratulations!!!! I remember when my twins were born; 24 minutes apart; one was 7'15" the other 7'9". My life changing moment? I would say the stillbirth of our son 15 months before the twins (both girls) were born. Losing him made me realize what was really important.... and I cherished them and their older sister (who was 8 when they were born) that much more.
My advice? Let the dustballs lay where they are and except any and all help you are offered.
Hugs!!!
Congratulations to the new family.
Having children was life changing as was becoming a foster parent. Best advice?? Try to find humor in chaos or unplanned moments.
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Congratulations on your double blessings. The most life-changing was the birth of my first child. #7 was just a little more in the fold. My advice, accept help when offered. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.
congrats to Kimberly and family on the safe arrival of the boys........
CONGRATULATIONS! WELCOME LITTLE BABIES!
I've never had kids, but I've been around a lot of them. My best advice is have a good Auntie that will watch Emma once in a while to give her attention since twins are busy little people. It helps Mom & Dad (ask my brother--he has two twin boys and an older daughter). Not sure if Auntie can handle the boys--they are four & full of themselves! Congrats!!!!
I havent popped them out yet but if I had three little ones I would try not to get behind on laundry. :) Well, I guess you could always sew more. Congratulations on the little ones!
Congratulations on the new babies, I'm so happy for you!
I don't know if this giveaway is world-wide (I'm from Brazil), but here I am. A life-changing moment for me was, definitely, the birth of my beautiful daghter. She is now 7 years old, and all I can say is that she is a blessing!
Love
Helena
Sorry... I meant 'daughter'!
Congratulations, Kimberly, Kevin and big sister Emma!! I can't wait to see what the names are.
Don't know about my biggest (there's been lotsa big ones) but one of them was moving from my comfy, suburban, close to everything house out to the country where the closest convenience is a feed store.
Oh how I love babies! Congrats on the twins! Can't wait to see pictures!
I think one of my biggest life changing moments was when my daughter was born. All of a sudden my parent filters kicked in and I became Mama Bear. I liked it. :)
Congratulations on the boys! Boys are wonderful!
Life changing event-my 3 children and now my 4 red headed grandchildren. I love being a Mimi!
Congratulations! The birth of my own sons was my biggest life changing moment. As for advice, keep grandma and your best girlfriend on speed dial. Best wishes : )
Wow! I only had one at a time, and I feel overwhelmed! My only advice is to do what YOU feel is right and forget the rest (comments, suggestions, etc). Parents are the experts on their children!
Congrats! Wow they were nice weights for twins! The best advice I can give you is alcohol and earplugs.
Congratulations! Enjoy every moment for they grow up far too soon.
Congratulations! Try to get as much sleep as you can and don't try to be perfect is my advice. My life changing events was the birth of my two kids. Happiest moments of my life!
Congratulations on your new sons The births of my three sons were life changing. My one piece of advice? Love them, hug them and always smile. Remember, they grow up fast.
Congratulations! What wonderful and exciting news. Can't wait to see pictures. Everyone loves babies because they remind us of everything good and precious in the world. What a blessing!
No kids yet, so my biggest changes were getting married and buying a house! Congrats on the healthy baby boys!!!
My life changing moment was when I met my husband and I always swore I'd never get married after seeing my parents in action.
Congrats on the bouncing baby boys! Though I only have one daughter, I'd say enjoy every day with them, they grow up soooooo fast! Before you know it they will be ornery teens LOL
Congrats!!! How wonderful! My most life changing moment was definitely the moment(s) that my sons were born, nothing compares to that first moment you meet the little creature that you've nutured for the past nine months.
WoW! Huge Congratulations to the very blessed family! Best wishes for lots of sleep in the coming months! My biggest life changers was the birth of my first little girl. My husband and I went from being two individuals, to two very humbled teammates! Every day being a mom can feel like a life changer, though!!! Anyway, congrats and enjoy those babies!
Congratulations!!! What a wonderful gift, two healthy babies. God bless all of you. My advice, although I have 2 girls (age 4 years and 4 months), is to sew whenever possible. Even if it is for just a few minutes, sewing is soothing. Enjoy your new bundles and your beautiful daughter!
Congrats! I am very happy for you.
Having my 2 daughters was the biggest changing moment in my life by far.
Congratulations times Two!!! I don't have advice for twins, but I know that you will be having tons of fun!! And burning lots of energy too. Can't wait to hear their names.
Breathe. Keep breathing. Don't stop breathing. Nice deep breaths.
Congratulations! Thrilling times ahead for all. Being a twin and being a big sister and at some point, you're counting to three everytime you leave the house or walk in the mall. LOL
Congratulations to the ENTIRE family! Hmmm, advice, just love them with all your might, even when they become teenagers. My life changing moment, besides having my boys was one month after having #3, having to move 5 hours away from my parents and other family members and losing my support system. I had to be a "real grownup".
Connie
My advice is that petroleum jelly is the best diaper rash preventative that there is.
Congratulations on the double bundles of joy and the Magic number three children in the house!
Enjoy!
realizing it's already been said, birth of my son was easily the most life-changing thing to ever happen to me. whoa! but congratulations, and here's to a quick recovery, mom!
Congrats! As a mom of 4, my advice is..........your house will never be perfectly clean for a long time. You have more important things to concern yourself w/. Let the housework slide.
Oh my goodness. My advice is if someone offers to help you--say YES!!!!
oh yayyy!!!
congrats on the jolly boys!!!
and trust me, we have 3, and it's not as hard as people make it out to be.
promise.
{i'm ready for 2 more.}
my heart is happy that god blessed yall's family.
Congratulations on the birth of your twin baby boys! Glad to hear you are all doing well. A friend of mine had twins and she said that she napped in the afternoons when her twins napped. She said it helped make up for some of the lost sleep at night.
You are blessed. Wishing you all the best as your family grows.
:0)
Congratulations! so far, my biggest life change was going off to college. It was my first time on my own, and the place I would meet my husband and so many forever friends. My wedding was a life change, and I'm sure kids will be one day too, but that first taste of freedom and responsibility was a big stepping stone. Here's to happy and healthy babies!
Congratulations on the new family members!
Congratulations! What a blessed family! 5 years ago yesterday, I found out that I was expecting my first child. It was a life changing moment even though it was impossible to really understand all that encompassed.
So happy for you!
Wonderful news! congratulations! I've had 6 of my own and really loved motherhood. Every stage was life changing! And now, a new stage; a life changing stage is about to happen...our youngest is heading off to college in a few short weeks and hubby and I will be alone after...count them....30 YEARS!!!! I can hardly wait, and yet I think we'll be so bored without anyone at the dinner table with us....it'll be weird, yet I amso looking forward to only having to pick up after hubs and myself....ahhhh!
Congratulations on these new additions! Take a few minutes every day to reflect on the joys of your family and the blessings!
Congratulations on being blessed with twins! We only have one child and are desperately hoping that god will someday bless us with more. So my advice would be...don't listen to all the people that say children get spoiled when you hold them too much. Hold them, and hug them for as long as you can because they grow up way too fast. And whether you like it or not, one day they will want you to stop holding them!
Children are definitely life changing! We have two boys and each have changed our family for the better. Also my husband and I are going to celebrate our 10th anniversary this weekend, so we consider ourselves very blessed.
Yay! Congratulations to the Jolly family!
Advice: remember to take time for Mom and Dad. It's good for your children to see you go on dates and spend time together. Babysitters are good things!
Congratulations to All! Your Grandaughter is absolutely adorable and I am sure will be a big help for Mom. I am a Mom of 5 and Nana of 10. The only advice I would give is what my Dear Mom gave to me-- God gives all parents instincts to help in the raising of our Children. If you listen to your instincts 99% of the time you will be right. You have gotten a Huge Blessing, Enjoy
Life changer?? Is there anything more life changing than having children?? I can't imagine anything rocking my world than when my 2nd daughter arrived. It was a good shake up, but boy howdy was there a learning curve!
Congratulations times Two! Having just spent a week with a newborn granddaughter, I am all about that sweet, sweet smell. Enjoy.
So very happy for your little family! How fun to be a big sister in your house. A life-changing moment in our house has been our first heading off to college. There's always another corner to turn. Enjoy every moment!
My advice is to give up any cleaning ambitions your family may have. Relax and enjoy your kids.
Congrats!! My Dear Daughter just gave us her good news of baby due in March. Dad and Big Sister (age of 7) and her Sister Dog, are really really excited! Nothing beats that new baby smell!! Enjoy the double whiffs of joy!
Congratulations! What a wonderful journey in life. One of my life changing experiences was the day I stopped smoking. I realized I had brought my kids into this world not to be poisons but to flourish life a flower in the wild open field of life. God's creation, a healthy child is a miracle to be nourished with love.
Kimberly you have lots of love and warmth..Lots of Blessings to your new family.
Carolyn Terrier
Just coming to say YEAH for the 2 newest members!
As a twin myself, enjoy them! My twin sister and I are best friends. It's an awesome relationship. Advice? Remember they are 2 separate individuals, and stress that. My sister and I used to get presents to share a lot, growing up, for well-meaning friends/relatives. They thought of us as one unit, not thinking. It was not fun... LOL!
Life-changing moment for me? Living through Katrina, and then finding out that God had something so much better for us than what we had. God is good, all the time!
Nancy
Congratulations! Advice: Rock, rock, rock... they grow too large for rocking and cuddling WAY too fast!
Kat
Congrats! Just play, enjoy every single moment! It goes by so fast and you will look back and wish you could have those days back again. Can't wait to see pictures and how much big sister loves the twins!
Congrats to the Jolly House! Life changing - definitely having kids. I had 3 kids, 4 and under, and I loved it. It's a bit hectic, but really, I'd go back to those days in a heartbeat.
Congrats on the two little ones. My life changing moment was when my first Grandchild was born, the same year I turned 50. I made a couple of promises to myself that I haven't gone back on yet in ten years.
Enjoy all three grandchildren. They are so precious.
Karen
Congratulaitons!! My life changing moment is the birth of my son because when you become a mother for the first time comes a huge responsibility. A great one!
Congrats! Glad all are well. My biggest moment was birth of number 4, who was a premie!
As for advice, remember there is no normal. :) Just roll with the punches...
Wonderful news!! Enjoy each & every moment you have with your new bundles of joy!!
SO many big congrats! Twins! Goodness...I can barely keep up with one. My only advice is take all of the help that's offered and ASK for help when you need it. I'm sure there's a lot of people around the JOllys that would love to help out with meals or bathroom scrubbing or babysitting. Can't wait to hear the names!
Marrying my husband Ed was a life changing moment for me! The end of the single life and the start of a new one with him. Combine that with going to seminary at the same time.....
God bless you Kimberly and your whole family, including these brand new baby boys!
Congratulations on the babies! My baby is grown now but I often remember the joy of his life.
God Bless You All!
One of my life changing moments was definitely the birth of my first grandchild. What a delirious feeling. Second only to the birth of my first child.
And he will be 14 this year. Wow, how the time flies!
Congratulations! My only advice is to enjoy each tiny moment as it comes!
Wow, congratulations to Kimberly and all!! And still thirty-one years late, I have to say my life changing moment was my first born son. It was the most awesome day of my life and I will never forget it!
Congratulations! I have 3, and you should take lots of pictures and video since they grow up so quickly! I can't believe my baby is 3 already!
Congratulations!!!
My most life changing event so far would probably be getting married.
congratulations to all, the most momentous occasion would have been baby nos 6 after a eight year gapand moving to a bigger house when she was 7 days old.
Congratulations on 2 lovely little boys !! Advice - enjoy every moment, they grow up so fast.
Congrats on the wonderful additions to the family! My most recent life changing moment was becoming an empty nester when my son joined the Army. He is now in Germany and it's hard to believe that he's all grown up! Treasure those little ones while they are young cause they will grow up way too quickly!
Congrats on the twins! How wonderful and what fun it will be! I'm sure Miss Emma will be a sweet big sis! I don't think anything in my life changed as much as becoming a mother. Hold them close - they grow up too fast! Oh - and take LOTS of pictures!!
I never thought becoming a grandmother would change my life like becoming a mother did. Well it did, loving a little someone that you watch your child being parent to is life changing!
My advise is to worry about all the other stuff later in life, and keep your babies(all 3 of them)close while they need and want to be close to you. It goes by SO fast!
Beth from Ca.
What a wonderful day! Congratulations! Like everyone else, becoming a mother was the most life changing event for me. I have loved every minute (almost) since Hudson was born. Here's a teething tip: Put some water in a baby bottle and freeze upside down. Then let the baby naw on the frozen nipple. =)
I have 3 sons, now 17, 20, 21. I kept a mason jar by the washer/dryer. I always put the little stuff I'd get out of their pockets into this jar. It was so fun to see the kinds of things a little boy considers "treasures" to save in his pocket. It has lego people, plastic animals, sticks, rocks...I could just keep going! Oh yeah, keep that thing covered when you change their diapers or you'll get a shower!
Congrats!
The birth of my daughters (5 and 3) were the biggest life changing moments for me. In an instant, seeing those tiny babies laid on my chest, I knew the deepest love imaginable. My life changed the second I caught my first glimpse of them! And now, my oldest is headed off to Kindergarten this year! wah!
My advice... let it go and just live. The dust will be back tomorrow even if you clean it up today. There will be dirty laundry and dirty dishes. That's okay. Just be with those babies (all 3a) as much as humanly possible. I think, I KNOW, we need them as much as they need us.
Now I'm off to peek at my sleeping babies! :)
Congratulations!! My most life changing moment was the birth of my 5th and last daughter, I felt so utterly complete. My advice is simply to do the best you can with the information and support you have available, and learn to say YES to help!
Congratulations! Enjoy them while you can...time passes very quickly. My 'bundle of joy' will turn 30 this year! Please enter me in the drawing.
How exciting! Emma is so so cute! Advice: don't let every little thing upset you. Life changing for me was the day, 18 years ago, when my girls were young... I stood by the refrigerator and made a promise to myself that from now on I would not let every little thing upset me. ...sure need a fat quarter pack Thanks for the chance to win!
Hi Congrats to all ..how wonderful.
My advice to the mother of three is "don't sweat the small stuff"! In later years they (and you) won't care that their shirt wasn't ironed or that you had spaghetti three nights in a row. They will however care that you took the time to read to them, cuddle them and took the time to teach them wrong from right.
Baby boys are wonderful things (I have had three) but it's a good idea to invest in some ear plugs! :-)
Congratulations! Emma will be a great big sister!!
I didn't have twins, but I have 3 girls, each 15 months apart, so I had 3 kids 2 1/2 and under. It was a fun, crazy zoo! My best piece of advice is to always make each one feel special in some way. And enjoy the craziness... they grow so quickly and you will find you miss it when they are older :o)
That's a big adjustment! I'm not a mom, but I'm the oldest of 7 kids, and did a lot of "mom-ing" over the years. My best advice is--never be afraid to ask for help. Family, friends, neighbors, guildies--they likely want to help but don't want to overstep bounds or don't know what you need. Tell them! People want to feel useful, and even if it's just running an errand, it will help you out in the long run, too. Good luck and congrats!
Oh, congratulations! So exciting. (And I do love that photo of Emma so just keep it up there as long as you like!)
My biggest life changing moment was when we found out that our son's birth mother picked us to adopt him and he came home with us a mere 6 days later. Talk about a lot of trips to Target! :-) He's still amazing even though he's headed into two with a vengeance--laughing hysterically over everything then screaming and kicking for 30 seconds followed by a swift return to everything is so, so funny. Ah, two. He is still the most life changing thing that happens to me every day. In a good way!
Congratulations! ENJOY every moment...you've been given very special gifts. Savor this time...they grow up so fast! (And, as I mother of a little boy...my advice is to stock up on Spray-n-Wash!)
Congratulations! So glad all went well!
Adorable pic of Emma! :)
Advice for family with three children, from one of three siblings... take turns getting to choose (ice cream flavor, toys, places to go, what to do) and keep rotating it, so as not to go by age or birth order. And don't get all three the same of anything - treat each one as the individual they are!
Life changing moment? Moving from the city to a farm, without seeing the house my husband purchased first. Never, ever, ever again...
I think your life-changing moment is MUCH more positive!!!
CONGRATULATIONS and thanks for keeping us in the loop!
So exciting! My advice is to never be shy about accepting or asking for help. People who love you are more than happy to jump in when you need a hand.
Congratulatoins and blessings to you all, beautiful family! Our family jumped from 3 to 5 the exact same way; my identical girls followed my boy! My advice to sweet mom Kim is put them on a schedule. A matronly old nurse told me that the day my girls were born; she gave me a clipboard and a pen and told me to record EVERY feeding and diaper change and look for patterns, pushing one to wait a smidge longer to feed and one to wake up a bit earler until they were one right after the other. It made ALL the difference in the world! Those baby girls are 18 and their big brother JUST got married this weekend. Enjoy them! That same nurse also told me the first 6 weeks are the hardest so I kept a calendar and crossed off each day...it may have been in my mind only, but it worked!
Congratulations! This is fantastic. We have two boys as well as I have to say our first child was the biggest shock we experienced. We went from being able to go somewhere on a moments notice -- to being lucky to arrive anywhere before noon. Congratulations on the little ones. I miss those days.
rsgrandinetti@yahoo(dot)com
Congratulations! wow, twins! I only have one 5 year old (it's enough for me!) so I can't give advice on three although I did think it would be nice to have twins so you could get it all over and done with at once. Anyway, a life changing moment for me was after I divorced my husband two years ago and finally stepped out on my own. I was so fragile and didn't think I could do it but just look at me now, I rock!
Congratulations to all! It is soooo exciting. Advice....hmmmmm....hard to come up with advice because they have already done this once. I guess I would say to let others lend a hand whenever they offer....oh and I do suggest washing baby socks in a mesh lingerie bag so they do not get lost. I also had twin boys in my classroom this year and one has "always" sported bangs while the other never has and kept it cropped...which is nice for the teacher.
Congrats!!! Life changing events...I married a man who had 2 teenagers, got pregnant withing 9 months of marriage and when that little guy was 11 months old I was 9 months pregnant with baby #2 and moving from WA to TN by myself to wait for the rest of my clan to arrive. It was go then with the 11 month old and the other one still in womb or travel with 2 little ones, 1 dog, 1 cat, 1 teenage boy and a husband along with whatever belongings we could maybe fit into a dodge intrepid. What is the best advice I could offer? Roll with it. There will be so many sleepless nights and so many moments of wondering what your doing BUT those moments fly by (as Mom and Dad already know with Emma). My little ones are 3 and 4 and I'd take back the year 2006 in a heart beat...just to hold the little ones so close to me again. Just to be the only one up in the middle of the night getting to know my little ones in a way no one else has.
AWESOME! Congratulations! My life changed drastically when my twins were born a couple of years ago, and it was equally difficult for our daughter who was barely 5 when they were born. She loves them now but it was a tough road for her. We've learned to have date nights just for her. We get a sitter for the twins and take her to dinner, then bring her back home to play with the sitter while we go out on our date!
My advice would be to take all the help you can get and don't try to be supermom. I have a hard time accepting help, much less asking for it, so that first 6 months was horrible for me until I learned to let people help.
Congratulations again and God bless you!
What wonderful news! Hope everyone is healthy and happy.
Every day is a life-changing experience...it's just that we don't usually see how small decisions alter our paths.
Best advice is to do whatever works for you! When someone tells you how it "should" be done, smile and do what you need to do. :)
Congratulation to that great news.
The birth of my daugther was truly the biggest change and challange of my life.. ;-)) also, when i met my husband. From the moment i saw him i knew, i wll marry him. Now we are married for 15 years and happy together.
have a great day and please put me in..
MAike
Congratulations! and welcome little babies.
Congrats! Children are the angels! My life changed when my girls were born and graced me with 10fingers and 10little toes each 30yrs ago, watching my daughter with 3 children 6mos, 2 Today!!, and 6yrs old. Life is very busy with the oldest into to sports and my daughters trys to do it all! As someone else stated here let the dust stay and dishes in the sink. Time will pass so fast and dust will still be there however those babies will be big boys and emma will be dancing, or playing a sport of some sort, dont miss anything they do for dust,dishes etc. Little boys are just sweet and loving. Have a wonderful time Emma with your Bothers.
Sheri
Congrats to your family! Hope you are doing well as well as two new babies... My life changing moment was to come to this country, to the US and learned quilting :)))
congratulations!
take the time each day to enjoy each one of your children and remember Emma will need a bit more attention since everyone will be in awe of the boys.
Take lots and lots of pictures something I regret as my girls got older not doing enough of.
Kathie
Congratulations!
I don't have children yet but my mom always says that you need to sleep while the babies are sleeping otherwise you'd never be able to rest ^^
And enjoy your beautiful family!
Thanks a lot.
Congrats on both baby's. My Life changing moment was that I met my husband, started quilting and when I broke my leg.
Just take everything one day at a time! My oldest was 3 1/2 when number three came along... things will be crazy, but a good kind of crazy!
Congratulations! Hope you'll all be very happy.
I'm young yet so I can't honestly say I've had too many life-changing moments... I'd have to say graduating high school and getting accepted into the uni course I'm doing now.
Thanks for the competition :)
Wonderful news! Twin boys - sounds like double the fun, how exciting!
My life changing moment - marrying for the second time, going from an only son to a mother of three! We were later joined by a second son & life has never been the same since!
Chris x
Congratulations!! Having kids is definitely a life changing moment. My best advice is to take things one day, one event at a time.
Congratulations to the Jolly family and to beautiful big sister, Emma! Life changing moment? Moving across the country and a month later giving birth to my son who joined his barely 2-year-old sister in our new home.
My only advice would be to take it one day at a time, don't let the little things (like piles of laundry and a sinkful of dirty cups) get you down and enjoy.
congratulations! while i do not have children, from my outside looking in perspective, it seems like one of the best things you can do with your kids if give each of them one on one time.
Wow, congratulations! I only have two, so I can't give any tips on having 3 - I can only imagine what it must be like to have 2 newborns at once :) I guess that in my life I've had many moments that have sent me down a new path, but finding out that I was pregnant and then meeting my 2 children would have to be the greatest :)
Congratulations! Twins?! Oh my. :) Emma will be one happy big sister!
My life-changing event was when I decided to move out on my own. I hadn't lived on my own before and was afraid to do so without a roommate. I had been a very dependent person before moving out and now I'm extremely independent. Complete personality change! I found myself and found several hobbies that I love.
Good luck with the new babies! I'd give advice on that, but I have no clue since I'm not a parent. All I have to say is goooood luck!
Congratulations on the birth of your twins!
One of my biggest life-changing events is when my sister and three of her teen-aged children came to live with me. I went from living alone to living with four other people. It was an adjustment, but I am richer for the experience.
what a cutie. The only advice I can offer is lots of sleep!!
Wow! How exciting!!! No particular advice for living with three little ones... but try to enjoy them. They grow so fast. Life changing moments... lots of 'em! My oldest daughter told her grandparents on the way to meet her new baby brother at the hospital that she really wanted a sister!!! Oh well. She got one three years later!
Hello Jolly twins!! So delighted that everything went OK and that the babies are both healthy :)
My life-changing moment was the day that I left all of my family in Canada and moved to England to share my life with someone whom I originally met online! 10 years later and I'm as happy as a bunny (still!) :)
Nikki
Congratulations! My biggest life changing event was the birth of our twins in 2003....my advise: set a schedule, and STICK TO IT...it's what kept me sort of sane!
Melanie (rphmel30@yahoo.com)
Congrats!! I had 4 kids in 5 years, none twins but they were all certainly life changing events! My advise, now that you're officially outnumbered, always remember to take things one at a time. You're not an octopus and can't handle more than one thing at a time - it's overwhelming when it can't get done and too many "projects" just leads to lots of unfinished to-do's. Same with the kids, you're going to feel stretched in so many directions, so give them each a turn and remind them that you love them all the same.
Oh that picture of Emma is so sweet.
Congratulations on the new baby boys. So glad to hear that all is well.
A life changing event for me was when my husband, children, and I moved to North Carolina from Florida. So many great things have happened in our lives.
Congratulations! My advice is enjoy every second, and take LOTS of pictures - it goes by way too quick!
How absolutely FABULOUS!!! Congratulations. Kidlets are definitely life changing - for the better - always. The joy and wonder they have brough to my life. The love that they give and make me feel - Life Changig!! Accept the help that people offer and take each day slowly - new routines take time to establish - that would be my very best advice.
Wow, and congrats!
My only advice is to enjoy every moment that you get. I had only one but now that she is 25 I have so many wonderful memories....
Congratulations!
I can't imagine any advice since I've not been there done that with twins!
As for my own life-changing event, it would have to be becoming a stay-at-home-mom. Flipped our world around, but it sure has been fun!
Congrats! Wow, such a blessed day for your family. Attending the birth of my grandchildren was my most recent life altering event. LIFE IS GOOD!!!
How wonderful! What a great day!
A life changing moment for me was when I adopted my foster daughter and she became my very own. It was a great day that we celebrate every year.
God Bless,
Cathy
Congratulations! I guess my life is pretty devoid of life-altering experiences to this point. My biggest life-changing experience was going from being a student to getting a real full-time job! (sounds silly, I know) No more homework or studying, but I do have to get up every. morning.

Report: the time being.
When asked today about his future in fighting during an interview on The MMA Hour, the 31 year-old-fighter reportedly stated “I said I would, so I am. I’m done for right now.”
Although Miller was able to land a few telling strikes versus Dollaway Saturday night, the accomplished wrestler controlled much of the fight and outscored him en route to a unanimous decision win.
Following the event UFC President Dana White said that Miller had been cut from the promotion.
In December, Miller was stopped by fellow TUF 14 coach Michael Bisping, after scoring wins over Kazushi Sakuraba and Tim Stout with DREAM and Strikeforce in 2010.
Miller (23-9) began competing professionally in 2001, and since that time the middleweight has scored wins over established fighters like Tim Kennedy, Denis Kang, and Robbie Lawler, among others.
In addition to his role on TUF, the outspoken fighter was also the host of MTV’s “Bully Beatdown”, which helped make Miller one of the sport’s higher profile fighters.

Last week we celebrated the arrival of my first cousin, once-removed, in-law.
I'll let that sink in for a second.
Got it?
How about if I call him my son's second cousin? Or, my husband's cousin's son? Whatever you call him, he is a precious gift to his family and we are so happy to meet him finally.
This guy's sex was a surprise until he was born, so Mommy went with a modern, gender neutral look for the nursery. It turned out lovely and it just so happens that she has similar taste in patterns and color, so it was a breeze to pick out fabrics and a design for this quilt.
I gave a peek at this quilt here as I was working on it on my new machine. This quilt was put together using triangle paper to create half square triangles. (You may remember I was working on another HST project here.) The triangle paper method was interesting. I won't say it was my favorite technique, but I did get accurate results. I suppose it's a matter of personal preference if you like precision or speed and ease.
Using bits and pieces of fabric leftover from the quilt, I whipped together a hooded towel and some little coordinating wash cloths. We personally use a lot of these at my house as LO's sensitive tooshie prefers a wet wash cloth over traditional diaper wipe.
I love making these for shower gifts because you get a lot of bang for your buck. The hooded towel and wash cloths come together from just one towel and some fabric scraps. First off, I cut a standard size towel to a square. Then I take the leftover towel piece and cut it down to squares - I think these are about 8 or 9 inch squares.
The fabrics:
Several prints from Robert Kaufman's Metro Living
Two prints from Kate Spain's Central Park
Several prints from Lotta Jansdotter's Echo
The turquoise dot print came from my local Beverly's (love them!)
I wish I could remember the gray solid and the orange/aqua/yellow floral print, but alas, the sources are escaping me at the moment.

Table 5: Summary Financial Results
Total revenue increased by 38.1% to US$1.8 billion for the year ended 2011 compared to US$1.3 billion in 2010.
The average realised price achieved by the Group for its pellets rose 28.4% during the period, which increased revenues by US$349.9 million. 40% of sales were on a CFR or similar basis adding US$44.7 million to revenue. Sales volumes reached a historic high at 9.9 million tonnes compared to 9.7 million tonnes in 2010, enhancing growth in margins.
Reliance on the Group's two largest customers, in Central and Eastern Europe, was reduced to 43.5% of pellet sales from 55.4% of sales in 2010. Ahead of an increase in production volumes the Group increased sales to customers in China, Germany, India and Japan which accounted for 41.9% of sales volumes compared to 29.6% in 2010.
Other revenue, not related to pellet sales, amounted to US$88.1 million (2010: US$5.8 million). This included revenue from third party services, such as bunker fuel sales, at the Group's barging subsidiary Helogistics (acquired in December 2010) as well as sales from gravel.
Total cost of sales for the year ended 31 December 2011 increased 34.8% to US$649.5 million (2010: US$481.9 million). Cost of sales consists of the C1 cash cost of sales and other costs including depreciation. These are reviewed below:
The C1 cash cost of production per tonne is defined as the cash costs of production of iron pellets from own ore, divided by production volume, from own ore, and excludes non-cash costs such as depreciation, pension costs and inventory movements, costs of purchased ore, concentrate and production cost of gravel.
The C1 cash cost increased by 27.7% to US$50.7 per tonne compared to US$39.7 per tonne in 2010, principally as a result of global commodity price inflation.
Of the US$11.0 per tonne increase in the C1 cash cost, commodity related price inflation accounted for 55.5% of the increase compared to 2010. In 2011, gas and electricity prices rose by 38.0% and 21.8% respectively while the cost of diesel fuel was 40.6% higher, reflecting a full year impact of the increased oil price at the end of 2010. Higher steel prices resulted in a 14.6 % increase in steel grinding media costs. In total, these factors added US$6.1 per tonne to the C1 cash cost.
Personnel, repair and maintenance and other material costs increased the C1 cash cost by US$4.9 per tonne. These expenses are principally denominated in local currency. On average Ukrainian producer price inflation was approximately 19.0% in 20111.
The Group produced at full capacity throughout the period, which helped to absorb the cost increases. In addition, the Business Improvement Programme('BIP') reduced the C1 cash cost by 1.8%, generating savings of $0.9 per tonne. Since the inception of the BIP in 2006, cumulative productivity gains have achieved savings of approximately US$6.6 per tonne of pellets produced, or US$56.1 million to 31 December 2011.
Just over half of the C1 cash costs are denominated in Ukrainian Hryvnia. The Hryvnia remained on average broadly stable in 2011 compared to 2010 at around UAH8.0 to the US Dollar.
1 Average of January 2011 to December 2011 compared to average January 2010 to December 2010.
Table 6: C1 Cash Costs
Non C1 cost of sales amounted to US$190.0 million for the period (2010: US$123.3 million).
Depreciation increased by 16.1% to US$28.6 million, reflecting capital investments at FPM in 2011.
The remainder of non C1 cost of sales related to the purchase of concentrate for reprocessing into pellets. The Group has nameplate pelletising capacity of 12 million tonnes of pellet production per year. Ferrexpo is currently able to mine ore sufficient to produce around 9 million tonnes of pellets. To utilise the spare pelletising and process capacity efficiently, third party concentrate was purchased when available on the local market. The Group will continue to purchase third party concentrate, provided adequate margins can be achieved. During the year, 747.3 thousand tonnes of pellet equivalent third party concentrate was acquired (2010: 998.1 thousand tonnes) which generated a positive contribution.
The Group's gross margin increased to 63.6% in 2011 compared to 62.8% in 2010. This reflected higher sales prices and volumes, which were partially offset by an increase in production costs.
Selling and distribution expenses were US$318.0 million for the year compared to US$212.0 million in 2010.
Selling and distribution costs to the Ukrainian border increased by US$10.7 million to US$138.0 million in the period (2010: US$127.3 million), equating to US$14.0 per tonne (2010: US$13.1 per tonne). These costs primarily include railway freight to the southern ports at Yuzhny and Ismail and to the western Ukrainian border as well as port charges.
Rail tariffs increased on average by approximately 10.8% during the year, this was partially offset by a discount for volumes transported by the Group's own rail cars. Currently, two thirds of the sales volumes are railed using Ferrexpo's wagons receiving a 6.5% discount for these volumes.
Table 7: Selling and Distribution Expenses
International freight costs amounted to US$152.7 million (2010: US$74.9 million). These costs, which are also reflected as part of revenue on associated CFR1 sales, relate to the shipping of pellets by ocean vessel to customers in Asia (on a CIF2 or CFR basis), and by barge to customers in Serbia (on a DAP3 basis) and Austria (through Helogistics). In 2011, Helogistics' operations were included for the first time. The Group doubled shipments of pellets to Asia to three million tonnes on a CFR or equivalent basis principally through the loading of nine capesize vessels thus increasing costs recognised.
Depreciation amounted to US$8.2 million (2010: US$1.8 million) and related to amortisation of Helogistics river vessels as well as to capital investment from the purchase of new rail cars.
General and administrative expenses were US$52.0 million (2010: US$49.2 million). This was related to an increase in professional fees, including legal services reflecting increased activities and projects.
Other income was US$6.9 million in 2011 (2010: US$4.5 million). The increase reflected higher operating income from the lease of premises to third parties at FPM.
Other expenses increased to US$17.1 million (2010: US$5.9 million). This reflected increased spending on support for the local communities in the Poltava region, where Ferrexpo is based and is a key part of the Group's strategy.
EBITDA increased by 36.8% to US$800.9 million for the year compared to US$585.3 million for 2010. This is the highest EBITDA achieved by the Group. The increase was mainly due to a higher average FOB sales price contributing US$323.4 million to EBITDA. This was partially offset by increased production costs of US$100.5 million, driven by domestic and commodity cost inflation, as discussed previously. The EBITDA margin was in line with 2010 at 44.8% (2010: 45.2%).
Finance income was US$2.5 million (2010: US$1.3 million). During the year, income from interest earned increased by US$1.1 million to US$2.5 million. This was driven by higher average cash balances in 2011 of US$604.8 million compared to US$165.7 million in 2010 as well as longer-term deposits receiving more attractive interest rates.
Finance expense increased to US$68.2 million (2010: US$41.6 million) which included US$28.8 million of interest cost on the Group's US$500 million Eurobond, issued in April 2011 at a coupon of 7.875%. Due to financial instability in the global banking sector, particularly in Western Europe, Ferrexpo drew in full its US$420 million revolving bank facility in October 2011. Interest on this facility is 225 basis points above LIBOR on drawn amounts. The average gross debt for the period was US$697.1 million (2010: US$346.8 million).
Ferrexpo prepares and reports its financial statements in US Dollars and operating foreign exchange gains and losses reflect the revaluation of trade receivables and trade payables that are denominated in a currency other than the Group's reporting currency at the balance sheet date.
During the period, the Ukrainian Hryvnia remained stable against the US Dollar at an average rate of UAH7.9579 (2010: UAH7.9547). As a result, there was no significant operating foreign exchange movements, with a loss of US$1.4 million recorded (2010: loss of US$1.1 million).
Non-operating foreign exchange gains or losses result from the retranslation of financial liabilities, loans and other similar items.
Non-operating foreign exchange losses for the period were US$1.9 million compared to US$3.9 million in 2010. The losses were primarily related to the revaluation of income tax payables in Swiss Francs. The average exchange rate between a US Dollar and the Swiss Franc was 0.88 in 2011 compared to 1.04 in 2010.
1 CFR is defined as delivery including cost and freight.
2 CIF is defined as delivery including cost, insurance and freight.
3 DAP is defined as delivery at place.
Table 8: Summary of Group Liquidity and Debt
Net cash flow from operating activities was US$502.7 million for the period, an increase of 32.4% compared to 2010 (US$379.8 million).
Working capital increased by US$111.4 million reflecting higher VAT and trade receivables. As a result of high capital expenditure during the year, and a delay in respect of VAT repayments in May, June and July 2011, VAT receivables increased by US$72.1 million during the period. Higher average prices increased trade and other receivables by US$17.4 million.
Total capital investment for the year was US$378.3 million, which was more than double 2010's investment of US$167.4 million.
Sustaining and modernisation capital investment was US$128.0 for the Group, of which US$121.3 million was invested at FPM (2010: US$49.1 million). The remaining US$6.7 million was invested at Helogistics.
In November 2010, the Board approved US$646.9 million for development projects at FPM and FYM. In 2011, the Group spent US$177.9 million in this regard (2010: development capex US$97.5 million). US$49.0 million was spent at FPM, while US$129.0 million went towards achieving first ore at FYM. The expected spend for 2012 is fully funded while the Group's low level of gearing will underpin future development spend for processing facilities at FYM.
US$8.3 million was spent on the Belanovo deposit (FBM) during the period (2010: US$2.4 million). This was for drilling works and site preparation activities.
In terms of logistics capital investment was US$57.8 million in 2011 (2010: US$17.7 million) which was primarily related to the acquisition of rail cars.
In January 2011, Ferrexpo paid US$38.0 million for the Helogistics acquisition, which was agreed in December 2010, and disclosed in the 2010 financial statements.
The Group's closing cash balance increased by US$570.7 million to US$890.1 million as of 31 December 2011, partly as a result of the net financing inflow of US$521.3 million following the placement of a US$500.0 million bond and the increase of the pre export facility from US$350.0 million to US$420.0 million.
Ferrexpo's gross debt had an average maturity of 4.0 years at the 31 December 2011. The Group has minimal debt repayments of US$10.8 million and US$10.4 million in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Net debt to EBITDA as of 31 December 2011 was 0.1 times.
Revenue US$ million
EBITDA US$ million
The Group calculates EBITDA as profit from continuing operations before tax and finance plus depreciation and amortisation and non-recurring exceptional items included in other income and other expenses, and the net of gains and losses from disposal of investments, property, plant and equipment
NOPAT US$ million
Net operating profit after tax

Spending the day with Accenture at their annual analyst presentation, it helped put a lot of our current predicament into perspective.
We can debate, for hours, the finer points of whether outsourcing is currently helping the wounded US economy, but what is abundantly clear, as Accenture’s CEO Bill Green points out, is the need for the US economy to be competitive globally – and to be competitive as a nation, we need our businesses to be competitive.
We also had the pleasure of listening to one of outsourcing’s legendary figures, Kevin Campbell, who runs Accenture’s $10bn outsourcing business. For those of you who don’t know Kevin, he was a pivotal figure behind the industry growth of HR outsourcing at Exult, before moving over to Accenture in 2005 post Hewitt’s acquisition. He is one of the industry’s most straight-talking and colorful characters, with a seemingly infinite supply of energy (evidenced by the 4.00AM emails he shoots off periodically).
Kevin makes some great points that outsourcing can – and is – providing many enterprises today with many more business benefits than simply slashing administrative costs. However, you need to engage a service partner which can deliver
He sums up the core benefits of outsourcing in three key areas:
1) Freeing-up cash-flow. A good F&A provider can add discipline to your collections and speed up your cash-flow, eliminate bad debt and free up a more timely cash-supply. On the flip side, quality procurement processes help you keep the cash you currently have.
2) Enabling growth. The need to enter new global markets quickly has never been as pressing as it is in today markets. Having a ready support infrastructure that can support foreign payrolls, accounting procedures, local regulations etc. can save your company months of painful work to set up shop in new markets. Moreover, service partners can also help you grow your business globally; Accenture uses the example of how they helped Unilever hire 10,000 sales staff in China, which has already contributed to 400% growth in same-store sales in the region.
3) Cost-cutting. A good outsourcing partner should be able to help you sustain cost-savings over a long period, not simply at the onset of an engagement, through ongoing quality and process improvements. Kevin points out, “Costs are like hedges – they keep growing back after you trim them”
My take? it’s all about outsourcing smartly these days, and not simply acting in desperation. Too many clients I speak to are locked into outsourcing contracts that are miserable experiences they can’t escape for years. And many companies today simply don’t have these years to sort out their global delivery issues.
In many situations, clients have jumped at the lowest cost option, and now live to regret their decision - we all know some in this predicament. It’s not a good time to go to your board and ask for another $20m dollars to bring a new provider into the mix, or rip up your current contract. Outsourcing clients have to think more smartly and strategically about how to create an outsourcing experience than can help drive new growth, can deliver business value to the top-line, and not just take out short-term costs from the bottom. If clients can engage outsourcing to become more competitive, it creates an entirely different paradigm than simply “shipping jobs offshore”.
The difference today is that more vendors offer significant cost-savings and scale and many buyers are wising up to this. However, we still see a lot of dead-end contracts getting signed by CFOs / CIOs who only care about the short-term and are not looking 2-3 years' out. Buyers need to take a longer-term approach to outsourcing, and hopefully this downturn is forcing many to think about stabililty and longevity and less about their next career opportunity.

If you have an auto loan and paid it 15 to 20 days late every month.. would that effect your credit score?
08-16-2012 12:05 PM
No, it should not affect your credit score. Its only if you are 30 days late or more is when a lender can report lates to your CRs. Even though it doesnt affect your CRs, It may affect the relationship with your lender by paying late.
08-16-2012 12:56 PM
Obviously it's not great for the relationship, and it will probably cause you to pay more than you should (late fees, rush payment if very late, etc). However I was in over my head on an auto loan from Chase 3 years back and was consistently 20-29 days late until the day I paid it off. On my credit report it reads with immaculate payment history. I feel like if I went back to Chase for an Auto loan today however, they'd probably dive into my old account and see how reckless I was.

This Is Not That Dream...Or Is It?4 Reviews
Brendon changes the performance...for better or worse. Ryden.
********************************
“Have you ever had a dream,” I said, beginning my infamous monologue everyone knew I did before we performed Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off, the skit everyone knew I made a move on Ryan during. “Where you were running through a sunflower field,” I began walking across the stage towards Ryan. He was standing there with a look that said “bring it”. “With clouds dancing across a crystal blue sky,” as I moved towards him, he started to back up a little. Stay where you are, idiot. I thought. “Your lover's running towards you, the wind whipping through your lovely lavish locks,” Finally he stopped backing up, and I moved closer, my face inches away from his. “You reach to your lover for that first passionate kiss!” And with that, I kissed him gently but passionately, catching him by surprise. I heard a lot of screaming from our fans, and the sound of camera flashing. “Hey, Brendon! Ryan!” Jon yelled out from the other side of the stage. “Will you guys stop sucking face long enough to finish this show?” I knew Jon had a point, so I pulled away before finishing my monologue. “This is not that dream. This is hard, sweaty, crazy, angry, monstrous fucking.” After taking two seconds to catch my breath again, I began to sing.
“Is it still me that makes you sweat?...”
********************************
“Let’s get these teen hearts beating faster, faster. Let’s get these teen hearts beating faster.”
“Thank you so much for coming, we love you, good night.” I said, taking a bow before joining everyone else backstage. I walked into our dressing room only to be met with Ryan, an unreadable expression on his face.
“Oh, err. Hey Ryan,” I stammered, hoping not to piss him off. He took a step towards me. “No! Don’t hurt me! I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to--” I didn’t get a chance to finish my sentence, because he placed one of his pale hands over my mouth.
“Why didn’t you just say you loved me?” he asked, removing his hands.
“Because --” I began, but he interrupted me again, this time by pressing his lips against mine.
“You’re damn well lucky I feel the same.” he said, smirking as he pulled away.

So...rate and review? :D

I'm What??!1 Reviews
"Damn. I must look like crap." she said to herself as she looked at the clock. It blinked the numbers 7:30 in its ritual repetitions. Great another day without sleep she complained to herself, knowing that due to her lack of sleep she was starting to grew dark circles.
In the hallway she could her hunged over father making his way towards the bathroom to look for aspirin. "Serves you right bastard." she whispered. Down the hall she could hear her sister waking up in the room next door. For some reason she felt envious of her sister. She was just 16 years old, just a junior, and already she had colleges begging for her to go.
"That's the only reason father doesn't touch you. Everyone would know if little miss perfect got hurt." she muttered under her breathe.
Immediately she regretted her thoughts, one of them deserved to be happy, for their mothers sake.
"Ali. Are you awake yet?" her sister called from the other side of her door.
"Yea Mirabelle. I'll be out in a minute." she replied as she put her notebook back into her nightstand.
"Ali."
"Yea."
"I love you sis." Aleson sat on her bed in a daze of what her sister just said. "I love you too Mira." she finally replied. "Get ready for school Mira, I'll drive you on my way to work."
"Kay."
With that being said, the sister bonding moment broke and back down came the reality on Aleson. While making her bed, she started thinking about the boys again. How much they have changed, how much she has changed, just how fame and publicity they have been getting. And with that she began to doubt if their friendship was still that. But leaving those thoughts aside, she walked over to the closet and began to pull random clothes out to wear.
With her backpack ready, packed with her cellphone, her other notebook, a pen, her wallet, and IPod, she stood against her bedroom door with her ear against the door, trying to listen for any signs of her father. With no sounds she walked out and went out to her car to find her sister already in the passenger seat with the car on waiting for her.
The drive was filled with nothing but silence. Aleson had nothing to say, and Mirabelle didn't know what to say. Neither tried to turn on the radio, or hum or even breathe loudly durning the drive. As Mirabelle got out of the car, she stood on the sidewalk and looked in. "For what its worth Ali, I love you for being my sister." and with that she shut the door and walked into the swarm of teenagers. Sighing Aleson continued her drive to work with music on this time.
When she reached the parking lot, she sat in her car for five minutes letting all the options in her life, but kicked them all out. There was no way that she could pull any of them off without the money from the crappy job. She slammed the door as hard as she could in fustration to let it out.
Walking past the automatic opening doors she was greeted by the paniced striken face of her co-worker Elliott. "Aleson Mr.Sperber says that he wants to see you in his office asap! And judging by his expression, it aint nothing happy." "Shit." she muttered under her breathe as she made her way to his office. Inside she could hear him in an uproar, she was about to run the other way when he spotted her.
"Aleson James get your ass in here now!" he bellowed out like the beast he was. Aleson opened the door and sat on the chair in front of his desk. "Yes. Mr.Sperber?" "You are fired is what!" "I'm what?!"Aleson jumped in anger. "You have been late way too many times. Look at this," he said as he laid a file on the desk. "Ten penalty hours, and not to mention that you come to work tired and looking like hell." "It's not my fault!" Aleson replied, thinking of all the times that she was beaten senseless that she couldn't even walk through the door. "Then give me a good reason why I shouldn't fire you." Mr. Sperber challenged. Inside Aleson knew she couldn't tell him the truth. "Fine." Aleson said as she picked up her backpack and walked out, on her way out she slammed his door so hard that it cracked the glass.
Looking at the floor as to not look at the co-workers she speed walked her way out of the store past the revolting doors, and slammed into someone else. The collision made her wince in pain from the bruises. "Watch where you're going."
"Sorr- wait. Ali?" the person said.
Aleson looked up and saw who she just snapped at and her eyes grew wide "Brendon!?"
Brendon helped Aleson up and apologized, after he had a laughing fit, that was. "You are the last person in the world, I'd expect working here." he said as he helped her to her feet.
"Well desperate times call for desperate measures, and this is practically the only place I could find that would hire me, for NOT taking my clothes off."
He laughed again, "Well I'll take your word on that." He hugged her, she winced inside as his arms brushed against the bruises. "Umm ..so," she began to say as an excuse to let go of the hug. "When did you guys get in?" "This morning. Everyone is still asleep on the bus. You know me, early bird."
This time she had to laugh. "Hey!" Brendon said laughing himself. "So.." Brendon said staring at his feet, caught in an awkward moment. "Umm.. Well I just got fired and I'm on my way to buy some breakfast or something. Wanna come along?" Aleson offered. "Yea."
He followed her to her car, and all the sudden stopped. "Can I ask you one thing?" Aleson raised her eyebrows, "What?" "Can I drive?" his face looked as if he was a six year old telling Santa his Christmas list, in hopes that it would come true. Aleson laughed. "How badly do you want to drive my car?"
Immediately Brendon dropped to his knees and began to crawl over to her, "So much that look at me, I'm on my knees. Please let me drive." Aleson could no longer hold it in. She began to hysterically began to laugh at her best friend. "You've been in town for only a couple of hours and already you're asking to borrow my car again."
Brendon got to his feet, "Well if you're gonna laugh at me, then I'm no gonna beg." Aleson handed him the keys. "If you scratch up my car, you are really in for it!" "Yes!" Brendon said happily as he took the keys from Aleson and opened the passenger car door for her. "Why, Brendon is such a gentlemen." "I always have been Ali. You know that!" "Of course I just love to tease you about it." she said as she stuck her tongue out at him.

Rock and Roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
“No I’ll… I mean I should… I guess.” Grey sighs clearly upset at the thought but he just doesn’t want Jo to be so angry, disappointed, and worried anymore. “Just… don’t follow.” He didn’t want her watching him feeding before, he certainly doesn’t want to have her watching him now. His cheeks burn in humiliation even saying he’s going to go do it. Grey grits his teeth and limps out of the bathroom without a backwards glance because if he hesitates he’s going to end up hiding in there still and making Jo even more worried.
Jo bites her lip as Grey says he should, moving like she’s going to go with him given how reluctant and upset he seemed. Though when he says for her to stay, she lets out a small sigh herself as she moves to the doorway and no further - not sure what she’s feeling worse about about it all.
Grey relaxes when she cups his cheek, leaning into her touch. “I’m sorry.” He mumbles again, looking at her sadly. “I shouldn’t have upset you.” His shoulders slump tiredly.
Shaking her head, it takes a long moment before she lets her hand drop away again. “I shouldn’t have.. yeah.” Glancing up at him, Jo lets out a sigh before glancing back out to the corridor. “Did… should you try to get to healing those now, or did you want to go back to the couch? You, uh..don’t have to use the demon if you don’t, Grey..”
Grey actually flinches back from her hand moving towards him because the tone in her voice is so hard and angry for a moment. “I’m sorry!” He blurts out impulsively, grimacing at the quavering sound in it.
She stares at him for a second, her raised hand hovering and shaking still for a second as all the anger at his words - or the other hunter’s words through him - disappearing. Reaching out, Jo cups his cheek instead with a pained look on her face as she’s not able to look him in the eye. “I… I didn’t.. I’m sorry..”
“Maybe I deserve this.” Grey whispers quietly, looking at his wrists. “Maybe I deserve this for what I’ve done. What I am.” He spent so much time listening to Gordon repeating that and that he was terrible for Jo because of it, then Jo comes back hurt and proves it.
Jo clenches a hand around her own arm as his words make her twitch to reach out and either hug him or slap him and she can’t quite tell which. “You do not deserve what’s happened. You’re not what that bastard thinks you are, Grey.. you’re not that.”
Grey shrugs. “You wouldn’t have half the things that are obsessed with you obsessed with you if it weren’t for me.” He look rubs his wrists slightly, making a slight face at the raw feel of them still.
“I think I had a fair few of them already swanning about without you ever entering the picture, hun. You’re not a cause of things that happened to me.” Jo glances down at his hands when he pulls a face, reaching out to separate them and look them over herself. “There are..ways we can work out how to avoid this, Grey..”
“Jo… you and Harry are the only ones who like me and are human.” Grey says gently to refute her saying it wasn’t most people. He looks back at her, sighing. “Anything else that likes me is either another monster or a demon. So yeah maybe not everyone thinks I’m scum, but the ones that don’t are made up of evil things. That doesn’t speak well on my part.”
“Yeah well, me and Harry obviously have better taste than the rest of humanity then.” She tries for indifference, giving him a smile though it gets weaker when he just sighs back. “You say that like some monsters, demons and people who are disgusting enough they should count as something that’s not human don’t like me too. Grey.. that dickhead doesn’t know the half of what he talks about..”
Grey shakes his head, pulling away with her slightly. “And then what would we do with this guy? Plus it would mean using another person or more people.” He looks away from Jo when she says killing bad things isn’t bad. “I am a bad thing according to most people.”
“I don’t.. don’t know, we could work somethin’ out. Find someone that’s not a someone any more, or someone that it doesn’t matter if they’re seen out hunting. I don’t know, I’m just.. coming up with suggestions.” Jo crosses her arms when he pulls away, a twitch of her lips getting close to a pout before she shakes her head and it away. “Not according to most people. Blinded people, people who aren’t able to open their minds.”

Google is prime for $1000. I think investors will take it there just to see that 4 digit stock price. What a milestone!
You don't even know what a crash is you retail fhead!
Honestly I think the only good advice on here was given by greymattermatters.
The other thing you can do is sell it all. Right now. You've made 7.5x your initial investment in 9 years. What will happen in the next 9 years if you hold?
I highly doubt you will see 750% gains here. So my advice is this. Sell now, and go diversify. Go and find stocks you think might be 750% winners. Check out ONVO, TSLA, etc....
Goog 139% up in 6m. Check it with 5% deviation
Sentiment: Strong Buy
any thoughts, I'm thinking about taking a "cheap" shot at it tomorrow.
We do not see or hear it on news at all......
y
I got out the first 30 minutes of trading. It was kind of strange selling, holding onto something that long. On to my next long term pick. Make it great day and happy investing :D
Sure, and I have a bridge to sell you in New York City.
Dow -750 in AM ???
He should take some Associated press journalists to take that job.....lol
You're really asking where the top in GOOG is. While no one knows for sure, I agree with Cuffs. This is not the top, we're still $100 or $200 away from it (i.e., 1000 or 1100)
Please pay us a dividend
u greedy bald headed fart
Please pay us a dividend
U GREEDY BALD HEADED FART
I probably should have just sold have but it was so much money
It went up too fast and i made almost 300.00/share so i am going to sit on the sidelines for a while and pray for a pull back down to 865 and try to jump back in
may i ask you what you did? sold, hold, hedged? still thinking over?
2014 EPS 2.75$ x PE 20 = 55$
Current price 34$ VERY Under VALUE,
MSFT stock price will catch up with GOOG rise............................
If you back out the $150 in cash. Does that bother any of you longs? Not me. If you believe the projections (which are a lot more reliable than Apple's for sure.) then this should go higher even after this big run up. What's it going to do retreat to a 10 PE. NO. A forward PE Of 20 might be a peak of some sort. That would put this at around 1,200. That works technically in so many ways and where I'm selling calls if we get there this year.
buying opt...booyah..having a sale...or is everyone buying AApl??

Shorties miscalculated badly this go round, and it is costing them. Just broke through 37.
I don't know if its a miscalculation or just the odds catching up to those of us who have shorted it. I am down 95% on my Feb 35 puts and it doesn't make any sense to pull out now. I will wait until about Feb 14 and hope for the best. Maybe consider a rollover at that time. This one hurts, but its part of the game and I will just get ready for my next trade. Bow
I was out this AM @ .50 on my .61 cost Feb55Puts. Market is too strong in this sector to fight the tape...

Vice?
But wait, there’s more. Biden then launches into a list of Democratic accomplishments—tobacco regulation, hate crime laws, insuring kids (SCHIP, I presume—you will excuse me if I don’t transcribe every word, Joe does go on a bit, you know)—none of them, as best I recall, ones that were first enacted during the Obama Administration [on this point, I stand corrected, but that raises other questions], and tries to contrast this out-of-date list with, well, for lack of any specific point, let’s call it the Republican alternative:
If they take over the House and the Senate, don’t kid yourself. They’ve made it really clear. Pete Sessions said [if the GOP takes over Congress], “We’d have the exact same agenda.” And look, there is a lot at stake here, and our progressive base, you have–you should not stay home. You better get energized because the consequences are serious for the outcome of the things we care most about. And I didn’t mention half the stuff we’ve gotten done.!
Joe Biden is not saying Democrats need an excited progressive base to win in November, and here is what the administration is going to do to excite them; Biden is saying Dems need an excited base—so the progressive base damn well better get excited. Period.
Don’t believe that the same folks that swept into the White House on a wave of popular enthusiasm could now be pitching this piss-poor woo? Biden was given a chance to clarify. He said that Obama is a gifted politician, but he didn’t “fall out of the sky.” Instead:
What he [Obama] brought out of the sky, down to earth, were really significant progressive goals that have been met.
Wait, what? He brought us goals? Obama gave us the goals? Progressives haven’t been articulating goals since. . . when now? 2006? 2002? 1932? 1916? . . . 1899? OK, maybe Biden just phrased that badly–but still, Joe, what goals have been met, exactly?
Sorry, I interrupted. Mr. Vice President, please continue. . . .
What he [Obama] brought out of the sky, down to earth, were really significant progressive goals that have been met. More to do, more to do. And so I think it’s time for our base to say, “Hey man, take a look, this opposition is for real.”
OK, again, the progressive base hasn’t been warning about the opposition? It has been the progressive blogosphere, far out in front of any Democratic Party organ, that has been telling the establishment that they had created space for the Tea Parties by aligning the White House too closely with the banksters. It was progressives that begged for a bigger stimulus, a jobs agenda, and health care reform that actually helped people and did so before the midterm elections. Jane, early on, warned folks not to take the Tea Party movement (movements?) too lightly. She, Jon, Scarecrow, David, and a host of others on FDL have all pleaded for Democrats to move more aggressively or else incur the wrath of a nervous electorate.
Why, just last night, I tweeted:
O’Donnell & Paladino’s GOP victories should remind prematurely giddy Dems that GOTV will be everything in November.
Does that sound like the twitterings of a guy that does not think “this opposition is for real?”
But that is not the narrative that Biden, his administration, or the Democratic leadership wants to tell here. Joe didn’t come out saying that progressives had the right idea, and though Dems had stumbled out of the gate, from here on it would be full speed ahead; “More to do, more to do,” doesn’t come close. Make no mistake, what Joe Biden was doing last night was blaming progressives now for Democratic losses later.
Maddow, maybe out of deference, maybe out of amnesia, took Biden’s frame as a given and asked, Why hasn’t the needed progressive awakening happened organically?
Joe invokes his grandpa, then reminds us that a lot of people are hurting, and that folks are angry and don’t want to make a choice. He recalls the words of Kevin White (Mayor of Boston, 1968-1984): “Don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. . . .”
Joe liked that quote, so he repeated it:
“Don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. . . .” People haven’t wanted to make that choice, they don’t want to focus yet. . . . . It’s like, “I don’t want to be bothered–I’m angry.” . . . but they’re gonna now, watch them. . . starting the beginning of October, they’re gonna focus. And the alternatives are stark between a Democratic-led House and Democratic-led Senate and a Republican-led House and Senate. . . . We are going to retain control of the House, we are going to retain control of the Senate because, when the American people focus on the alternative, it’s gonna be absolutely clear to them that there is no alternative.
Back in the 1990s and early 2000s, I was a consultant—of the branding and marketing variety–and Biden’s performance reminds me of some of my worst clients from those days. These guys (and gals) would sit behind the two-way mirror watching focus groups, and they would deride the respondents and curse about how their stupid target consumers were wrong—wrong!–about their product. It was the consumer who was doing a bad job of understanding the product. It was the consumer that was not paying attention to the right things. It was the consumer that had failed to understand the benefits of these clients’ brands.
Those were not successful brands. And without a change in their point of view, they didn’t become successful brands.
Let me put it this way: Joe Biden is your cable provider screaming that they are better than the phone company, and you know they are better than the phone company, and if you don’t know that, no matter what your experience, then it is your problem, you fucking idiot.
Compelling messaging, huh?
It didn’t work for my clients, and it won’t work for the Democrats.
It is not enough to say, “C’mon, you know how bad the other guys are.” It is not enough to say, ”Buy my product, or else.” It is not enough to say (as Jon Stewart pointed out to DNC Chair Tim Kaine), “They suck worse.”
If you want to bridge the enthusiasm gap, it is you, Joe Biden, President Obama, national Democrats, that have to provide the enthusiasm. And the reasons for all of us to be enthused.
Another lesson from my consulting days: it is never good to be the “not” brand. That is, it is never good to define yourself as “not the other guys.” By doing that, you are dependent on them. By doing that, they define the space. All that is left for you to do is react to your competition.
In a competitive marketplace—especially in one where you don’t have to buy, where you could just opt to stay home—you have to give people a reason to commit. You need to articulate a distinct benefit.
You need to give folks a reason to vote for you; not just against them.
Without demonstrable benefits—or at least the promise of them—there is no enthusiasm. The winners of the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries should understand that.
But benefits were not what Vice President Biden was selling to Rachel Maddow and her presumably progressive audience on Wednesday. Biden went with fear and loathing, blame and bluster. That strategy didn’t work for my clients in boom times, and it won’t work for Democrats now.
So, Joe, uh–how did you put it?—get in gear!
You don’t sound very enthusiastic.

It is said that 1914 saw the end of romantic war, that the nations of the world finally woke up to the horrors of combat. The century before that was the age of imperialism, where nationalism ran rampant after it was awoken by revolutionary France. Nations could do no wrong, they brought "civilization" to Africa, India, East Asia. Europe was the center of the world and nations vied amongst each other for supremacy.
The British, French, Germans, Austrians, Italians and Russians had little doubt of their own moral, social and international superiority. It was manifest destiny on a grand scale, and this pride - both among the leaders and the populace - is what led to the deadly arms races which in turn exploded into the Great War. Each side was confident of victory, wars would be short and the blood would be shed on the other side.
European experience, after all, was based mostly on the recent conflicts in Europe itself, like the Seven Weeks' War between Austria and Prussia, or the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. The lessons of the Crimean War - poor leadership, underestimation of firepower and fortified positions were ignored as being outdated and part of a limited conflict. Similarly, the lessons of the American Civil War were ignored as being a "colonial" matter, a primitive war in an alien environment.
Thus, both sides entered World War I with the highest expectations of glory. Civilian populations cheered the soldiers on, the young men promising to come back to their girls in time for Christmas. Germany's Schlieffen plan commited most of its forces into a wheeling attack through Belgium down into France, forcing an early capitulation of France on the western front and then quickly transfering its forces back to the eastern front, where a minority of Germany's armies were to fight a delaying action along with the Austrians.
Of course, we all know how that turned out. Soldiers dug in to trenches, pounded by artillery and kept down by snipers and machine guns. Old guard generals, learning nothing from successive failures, relying on lessons from wars 40 years old, sent their cavalry to die futilely in between trenches, forced men at gunpoint "over the top" to get slaughtered by withering machine gun fire from enemy trenches - and then blamed their failures on morale. The romance of war was slow to fade on the home front, but no government could disguise the horrific casualties for long.
Thus, the Allies, the winners of World War I, were hesitant to fight another war. People were tired, disillusioned and terrified of another such conflict. American isolationism - difficult enough to overcome during World War I - would dominate the political scene until Pearl Harbor.

From NBC's Chuck Todd and Domenico Montanaro
Obama is debating on McCain's turf with taxes and spending....Obama needs to pivot... It's long enough... This doesn't have anything to do with the economy. Or foreign policy for that matter. He tried with the first mention of Iraq.
McCain's the first to mention jobs and he does it by proposing 700,000 new jobs through nuclear power plants.

I just removed myself from klout.com. For those of you who don’t know, Klout claims to be “The Standard for Influence” for individuals in social media. Klout claims to measure your social influence by applying a proprietary algorithm to your public activity on various social networks, such as twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and google+.
Unfortunately, both the idea and the execution are deeply flawed.
1. Klout doesn’t take into account offline influence
Klout only measures what it measures, but those parameters are telling only a very small part of the story. Warren Buffet, for example, is a hugely influential man. He doesn’t give a monkey’s backside who he follows or doesn’t follow on twitter, or how often he tweets. As a result, his Klout score is low, a huge distortion of the Buffet’s position in real life.
2. Klout begs to be manipulated
Tony Hsieh, Zappo’s CEO, tweeted it perfectly:
Too many marketers concentrate on building buzz. I can tell you that my mom has zero buzz, but when she says something, I listen.
One of the problems with Klout is that it rewards conformism. Tweet about what everybody else is tweeting, retweet trending topics, run with the pack and your score will most likely go up.
This point was recently very effectively illustrated by Neil Kodner, who created tens of twitter bots (based on Seinfeld, The Big Lebowski, and more recently Sarah Palin), some of which have attained Klout scores as high as 74.
When bots get higher influence scores than one of the richest men on the planet, you’ve got a problem.
3. Klout makes people lazy
People have been failing college exams because of low Klout scores. Others have been passed over for jobs.
Here’s what I think: If you’re an employer who uses a candidate’s Klout score as a metric to decide on a candidate’s employability, then you don’t deserve to be a hiring manager.
People, and the skills they bring to the table, are far more multi-faceted than what a Klout score can possibly reflect. Using a Klout score to make a hiring decision is like using research as a lamp post to lean against, rather than for illumination.
4. Influence needs to be relevant
Klout assigns one catch all number to an individual’s influence, but that’s not how things work. If you want to connect with Mennonites, a twitter account won’t do anything for you. Sponsoring barn dances just might, despite the fact that they come without a Klout score.
5. Klout is opt-out, rather than opt-in
Klout claims to only publish publicly available information, but there’s been recent concern about publishing information that was never meant to be public. Here’s an excerpt from an article in the New York Times:.”
Klout has since deactivated that functionality, but still automatically creates profiles for anybody with a twitter account, whether it has your permission or not. To check your own score just type in klout.com/yourtwitterusername.
Klout has, finally and grudgingly, given in to public pressure and now allows people to opt out of their service.
6. How to opt out of Klout
This might sound counter-intuitive, but to opt out of Klout, and to remove your details, you will first need to open a Klout account. Sign in with your twitter credentials, then navigate to the bottom of the privacy page where you’ll find an opt-out link. Follow the instructions and your information should be removed within a couple of hours.

why do you wanna land a stingray, so you bring it up and look at it, to much risk, trouble and for something thats fights that hard, it should be released.
plus that isnt a "big" eagle ray.
die hard the only safe way to land these is to gaff them, but then its probably gonna die, make a decision cut the line when its beat and youve won the fight, let it go. or only keep it if youre gonna eat it, theres better things out there

what we do, is gaff em, flip em on ther backs, get a towel, stand on the tail with the towel under your shoe, use pliers to get the hooks out, then still attached to the gaff, get down onto lower rocks, ungaff him (inverting the gaff, so it slides out-- pretty easily) into the water and hey presto. never had a stingy die on me once ive released it. they are bloody hardy creatures and 9 out of 10 times, if there correctly gaffed, they will live. i always would like my rig back, so i try as hard as i can to get it. only ever once cut the line-- it was as close to the second snell as possible, and it was in a biggg wobbygong that iw asnt sticking my hands in. theres a picutre of it kicking around somewere on here.
bludgin' since 94'
Oh ok so you gaff him in the wing nearest to the end?
how long outta water can they live (incase of pics)
no way. gaff em in the mouth! try not to keep em out for too long, 2 minutes is more than enough for pictures
gee whispers !
in the mouth wouldnt that like go through the head or sumfin?
or just grab the leader and lift em up lay em on there back and pull hooks out n throw em in - i spike em and eat the flaps they taste like chicken - rolled in flour mmmmm
gaff em in the wing if you wanna either eat it, or leave it with potential diseases. your choice.
the wound would heal in a few days
ive always gaffed my stingies in the mouth. never had one die on me. the mouth makes it easier to manage when its on the rocks. gaffing it in the wing can have the possibility of the gaff ripping through the stingray. have seen it happen. im sticking to mouth gaffing as its easier and safer. wich would you prefer- mouth gaff it, flip it onto its back and be done within 5 minutes rather than wing gaffing it, having a stingray flapping around flailing its tail and barb around to the risk of it barbing someone? what are you saying that could happen by gaffing them in the mouth?
hmm ur right there. So as they are next to the rocks u somehow? gaff them in the mouth then u somehow? lift them up flip them over ASAP put/wrap a towl around their barb stand on it while removing hook. then stand off towel pull tell away and somehow lif it up and place in water? then angle the gaff till it slides of its mouth X)
once youve surfaced it, grab the gaff and slide it under its head, and the gaff barb will slot into the mouthand you yank it, to secure it. then you use uyour upper body strength to slide them up onto the rock on their back. you keep the gaff in its mouth as long as you can, makes for an easier release. what i do, is invert the gaff while the ray is still on thew rock, in wich it will flap, rekleasing the gaff and sliding back into the water. if it dosnt slide back, push it in with the gaff.
hmm... 1 question though. will it cause the ray any harm if we remove the barb and then release? trophy u noe.. especially the big rays
it shouldnt caus eit any harm, in fact it makes it safer for us anyway. just my opinion though
Yes you are right Leemo i heard fisheries (personal chats) saying that u should remove barbs as it will make the next catch easier! it was also in a magz.
taking the barb out can also be safer for the stingray itself. we had a medium size black ray at pinaroo point o0ne night and it barbed and killed itself. i havnt caught a stingray in a very long time and im itching to land one again. not much spare time being at school though, unfortunately.
Yes damn school :/
need to get something big anything.... need to stretch my arms a bit :O

i would have thought gaffing the wing would cause much less harm than gaffing the mouth? Also just cuz it swims away doesnt mean it wont die. Little ones like that should be easy enough to handle anyway, especially with a couple of ppl.

Don't remove their barb if your releasing them...
It's their primary defence mechanism its just bloody cruel,
All you need to do is be wary of it when you do catch one...just totally unnecessary to debarb them

Gym Class: Jillian Michaels BodyShred at Crunch
Jillian Michaels has already entered living rooms around the country via The Biggest Loser and her popular DVDs, now she’s coming to a gym near you. Recently we got a chance to check out her new class, BodyShred, which was taught by the fitness queen herself. The class launches at Crunch gyms September 10.
What it is: The 30-minute workout uses Jillian’s 3-2-1 approach. Participants complete three minutes of strength, followed by two minutes of cardio, and one minute of abs which is repeated over the course of four circuits, with each circuit being performed once on each side of the body. The workout incorporated a variety moves, including some floor work, some yoga-inspired exercises, and plyometrics.
My experience: I genuinely had fun working up a sweat in this class. The routine moved at a quick pace, which kept me engaged, and kept my mind off of how much I was sweating or struggling.
What it worked: This was truly a total body workout. Most moves toned multiple muscle groups at once. Designated ab work targeted the core, exercises like squats and lunges worked the lower body, and we also did some arm work with free weights, as well as several push-up variations.
Who it’s best for: Busy people. It was nice to be able to work up a sweat feel the burn in a mere 30 minutes.
What to watch out for: The workout is vigorous from beginning to end, so it probably isn’t for complete rookies.
Final word: BodyShred will give you a quality—and challenging—workout in minimal time.

I have reached the conclusion today that I thrive on shipping angst.
I almost always ship things that:
- Don’t happen.
- Don’t happen but are accompanied but large amounts of angst anyway.
- Happen but end horribly.
- Happen but are accompanied but large amounts of angst.
I don’t get it, but I’m just going to go with it.
Your not alone.

So over dinner tonight I asked the question, "What is your favourite film?" and to keep it completely fair, I thought it only right and proper that each person should have their own entry.
So I give you, Five Go Blogging's Top 5 Kids Movies.
At number 1, from the smallest member of the family, the Wee One, I give you Dumbo.
He has watched ooh about 10 minutes of this classic Disney film before something else (like a car or a pencil or a duplo block) distracted him. But according to the Big One (who helpfully translated for him) it is his all time (18 months of life) favourite film and he especially likes the first bit where the stork keeps dropping him through the clouds!
At number 2, from the Princess, I give you Monsters Inc.
Reason? Well she has a little girl crush on Boo who is her absolute heroine, right after Jessie from Toy Story (but that would be pinching the Big One's favourite film, in at number 3, Toy Story 3.
Well what's not to love? Actually I'm not entirely sure because I haven't actually seen it yet. (I know, where have I been?) But I am reassured that despite a slight shedding of a very small and hardly noticable tear at the end of the film, the Big One LOVED it.
At number 4 we have a tie from Misty Moo, the hound of the family. She asked me to toss a coin for her (on account of her lack of thumbs) to decide between 101 Dalmatians and The Fox and the Hound. And... drum roll please.... The Fox and the Hound won!
Another classic with humour, tears and friendship. She is a big softy for a happy ending too.
And finally, at number 5, I get to have my choice. Darn, it was hard to choose. But in the fashion of an X Factor judge, I was pushed to make a really tough call. Well based on todays performance in our living room, and the fact that I was bloomin' knackered and still managed to stay awake, I give you Jungle Book. "Well I'm the king of the swingers, the jungle VIP, ..."
I defy anyone not to tap their foot, swing their hips and get down and sing along.
Thank you Kate over at Kate Takes 5 for her Listography prompt this week. Go on over and check out the other lists.
Great list! I love them all.
My only school musical performance was tinging a triangle to the bear necessities, great choice!
My 3 year old loves all the Toy Stories! Last week we visited family in Plymouth. There was a big screen in the city centre showing Jungle Book for free. All the grown ups sat on deck chairs & watched the film: the kids just ran about in the sunshine!
The Jungle Book is on our list too!
Brilliant list! Don't worry about not seeing Toy Story, I've never watched Monsters Inc - though we just bought it, so I shall be rectifying this heinous mistake shortly. xxx
Love 'em all. Too many to choose from this week.
Great list - such a fab idea as it gives you ideas for films to watch and jogs a few memories too!
Excellent :) I keep seeing films that I'd totally forgotten about, but now I need to watch again lol.
See there are just too many good kids films- how did I miss out dumbo? Having said that I really did think storks delivered babies ....... clearly NOT the case! Xx
I love love love the Jungle Book, but it didn't quite make my list, I'm so glad to see it here
Ha love it! Great list - especially the first choice - must have been a tough one to decide on that!

Non-narrative jump to today: I read Afar Magazine. Their July/August 2011 issue has a story on bicerin (bee-chay-reen), an Italian beverage with secret-recipe roots stretching back to 17th century Turin along the foothills of the Italian Alps. Its main ingredients are milk, melted chocolate, espresso and whipped cream. Cafe Al Bicerin, a Turin institution that takes its name from the drink, is where locals head after Sunday Mass to break the fast. God bless the Italians, with their Roman Catholic guilt and their natural disregard for calorie counts!
Of course, I took one look at the Afar story and said, “Dude, I should totally incorporate that into a cocktail.” And what I did was, I sent it over the Alps. What the fuck does “send it over the Alps” mean? It means (says me) to douse peaks of whipped cream (“the Alps”) with a shot of yellow Chartreuse, that suave, milder-than-green-Chartreuse liqueur made by monks in the village of Voiron, along the foothills of the French Alps (“send it over”).
My recipe was kismet: The thought of adding yellow Chartreuse to the bicerin stuck in my head for a few days, then I discussed it with Sean and found out he’d had the very same notion, then I Googled a map and saw that, indeed, the mother lands of Chartreuse and bicerin are a mere three hours apart, the Alps stuck in between. Something about bicerin made me less wary than usual about doing a dessert cocktail, and while my end result technically isn’t a cocktail but a spiked coffee beverage, it reads on the palate like a cocktail to me: You can detect all the parts that are in there but the impression on your senses is that of a fully integrated taste, more than the sum of its parts. (Spiked coffee beverages, on the other hand, often taste to me as just that: Coffee with a high-spirited intruder who somehow found his way in.)
We contemplated a second liquor, but it just doesn’t need it.
P.S. I like this one so much, I’m contributing the recipe to the first-ever gojee Virtual Potluck, an online smorgasbord of eats and drinks put together by yours truly and many of gojee’s other fine blogging contributors. Starting on Thursday, January 26, check out other potluck dishes fellow gojee contributors shared. Go to gojee.com and enter “gojeepotluck” into I Crave. You can also follow #gojeepotluck on Twitter.
The Bicerin (send it over the Alps)
(Adapted from Afar Magazine; its recipe for the original bicerin is an educated approximation, as Cafe Al Bicerin’s recipe is “closely guarded”)
2 ounces yellow Chartreuse
1/2 cup 2% milk
1 1/2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 shots very strong coffee
1/4 cup freshly whipped cream, sweetened to taste
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the milk and chocolate until boiling, whisking vigorously all the while. Remove from heat, then pour mixture into a clear cappuccino mug, goblet, etc. Slowly pour in coffee. Top with whipped cream. Slowly pour Chartreuse over whipped cream. Serve with a sundae spoon (optional).
Tasting Notes
Afar‘s printed recipe calls for whole milk, dark chocolate and espresso. I went with what I went with (2%, semi-sweet, “strong coffee”) because I already had them in the house. Having said that, this drink was diabetic coma-inducing enough the way I made it. Proceed with whole/dark/espresso at your own risk. (Seriously, garnish with insulin injectable or something if you must go all the way.)
If you don’t have yellow Chartreuse, try making this with a shot of Benedictine instead. Their smell and taste profiles are quite similar, although of course you won’t get the same, sunny brightness shining down on your Alps. Don’t use green Chartreuse; it’s too herbal in taste, and everyone will assume it’s creme de menthe and that you made some sort of caffeinated Grasshopper.
I was afraid of melting chocolate in a saucepan rather than a double boiler, but with the milk this was actually not an issue at all. (I did use a nonstick saucepan, for what that’s worth.)

Craked has a.... mixed record when it comes to gun rights. But even they seem to get the whole "Gun Death" thing. In their article on The 6 Most Brutal Murders Committed by Batman, they say this in the opening paragraph:.Batman is a pretty good example of the whole "Gun Death" nonsense. For example:.
Isn't it better that instead of using the rifle to kill people he... used the rifle to... kill people.
The above list includes: forced starvation, impalement, lynching, crushing with industrial machinery, and incineration. But Weerd is wont to say: Hey, but not a “Gun Death”, so it doesn’t count!

The most significant change to our presidential forecast model this year is that it contains an economic index, which is used to guide forecasts along with the polls.
In fact, as you may have seen since we began our short daily summaries of the model’s output, new economic data often has just as much influence over the forecast as the latest poll from Ohio or Florida.
I have some fairly strong views about the right way to use economic data in a forecasting model like this one. This is fundamentally a very challenging problem because there have been only 16 presidential elections since World War II, and yet there are dozens and dozens of plausible economic variables to pick from. (The Federal Reserve’s Web site, in fact, now publishes about 45,000 economic statistics.)
The historical evidence is robust enough to say that economic performance almost certainly matters at least somewhat, and that poorer economic performance tends to hurt the incumbent party’s presidential candidate. Likewise, it seems clear that the trend in performance matters more than the absolute level — otherwise, Franklin D. Roosevelt would not have been re-elected easily with an unemployment rate well into the double digits (although rapidly declining) in 1936.
But we just do not have anywhere near enough to data to make confident claims about exactly which economic variables are important. For that matter, most of the more obvious choices for economic variables have performed about as well as one another on the historical data anyway. Each one gets some elections right and some wrong.
Let me explain some of the choices I made about the model in light of this problem.
First, I wanted a composite economic index rather than picking just one or two variables.
If it is hard to tell exactly which economic variables are most important to elections, it seems far better to take some kind of aggregate or average of them rather than arbitrarily picking one. As you will see later, different economic variables this year would give you a radically different outlook on how likely President Obama is to be re-elected.
One of the reasons that some of the presidential forecasting models published by academics have not performed all that well is because they have not adopted this consensus approach. Instead, they will use just one or two variables. Yet rarely do they use exactly the same variable, and sometimes the choice is something fairly exotic rather than commonly-used measures like jobs growth, inflation, or gross domestic product.
In some of these models, it seems evident that the modeler has searched through hundreds of different model specifications to get the best ‘fit’ on past data. When dealing with noisy data and a limited number of observations, however, that can be a problem, because it will introduce significant selection bias or overfitting. Over a small sample size, it is inevitable that some variables will have performed much better than others because of luck alone. If you calibrate the model based on the lucky variables, their luck will eventually run out and your model will not be as accurate as claimed when used to make real predictions.
In addition, the American public experiences many different facets of the economy in many different ways.
It’s a basic rule of sound forecasting that data subject to measurement or modeling error becomes more robust if you average or aggregate it together. Typically, this averaging or aggregation process reduces forecast error by about 20 percent.
Second, I wanted to use relatively broad-based measures of economic performance rather than narrowly tailored ones..
I wanted to look at the sorts of measures that investors and economists might weigh most heavily in gauging the performance of the economy, and I wanted an index that makes good economic sense, rather than being cherry-picked to fit elections data in particular.
I also wanted to pick variables that reflected different aspects of economic activity without double counting them, although there is certainly some overlap in the ground the variables that I chose cover.
Third, I wanted data that is updated regularly — monthly or more often.
If you did want to use just one variable, then gross domestic product might be a reasonable choice, being the broadest-based measure of economic activity in the United States. (Although G.D.P. still contains plenty of noise, like the inventories adjustment.) The problem is that G.D.P. is updated only once per quarter, and then with a significant lag. If it becomes clear in July that the nation is experiencing an economic collapse, it doesn’t make much sense to have to wait until late October (when third-quarter G.D.P. is finally reported) to have that reflected in an economic model.
Fourth, and related to this goal of building a model that could make realistic forecasts in real time, I wanted to use data as it was initially reported during election years to calibrate the model, and the data as it was revised after the fact.
Most economic data series are subject to revisions; the process can persist for months or even years after the fact. Sometimes, these can be very severe — turning a quarter that was originally thought to provide average growth in to a recession, or vice versa.
But the magnitude of the revisions — and therefore, the reliability of a data point based on its initial print — can vary a lot from indicator to indicator. Some series are revised much more than others, and a few even have a history of biased revisions (meaning that the revisions usually tend to go in one direction).
This problem gets too little attention, in my view. I will sometimes visit macroeconomic forecasting Web sites where economists and investors get into detailed debates about which variables are more lagging and leading. But usually they are arguing about revised data, all of which is lagging in the sense that it is not available to forecasters seeking to make predictions about the economy in real time. The lack of sensitivity to these data-quality issues may hinder economic planning and is one reason that economic forecasts are often much less accurate than advertised.
The initially reported data, meanwhile, is also what is available to candidates and voters at the time of the election. Some econometric models score the 1992 election as a “miss,” because revised economic data shows roughly average growth during that year, when the incumbent, the elder President Bush, was defeated. However, the data was still quite poor as it was reported during 1992 itself. The initially reported data represents a closer approximation of what voters would have been weighing at the time.
Fortunately, the Federal Reserve is doing a better and better job of making archived economic data available through its Alfred Web site. Not all 45,000 variables are archived, but most of the major variables have reasonably good coverage, especially from the mid-1960s onward.
What I settled upon is a series of seven variables. The variables are weighed equally in the model, with one slight exception. All are relatively broad based, and are available in archived form going back to at least the election of 1968.
The first four variables are among the monthly indicators that economists most commonly use to help date recessions.
Nonfarm payrolls. This is the jobs figure that is commonly reported in news accounts, as in “100,000 jobs were added last month.” I prefer this figure to a calculation based on the unemployment rate, which comes from a separate survey but which is subject to larger measurement error.
Personal income. Many academic election models use this variable or close cousins of it, like disposable personal income. I use the personal-income version because the archived record for it is more complete.
In theory, this variable has a lot of merit, since it reflects the different income streams coming to voters. A pay increase at work will be reflected. So would things like stock dividends or rental income.
In practice, however, measuring all these different income streams is challenging for the government. So this variable can fluctuate wildly from month to month and is subject to severe revisions. (These revisions, moreover, have been upwardly biased in the past, meaning that the government initially tended to underestimate income as measured in this way.) This variable can also be sensitive to changes in government policy, like stimulus payments, which voters may not react to in the same way as other types of income.
Still, this variable is certainly useful as long as it is not treated as some sort of magic bullet, and it is included in our index.
Industrial production. This is the granddaddy of economic variables — the government has kept track of it since 1919. Industrial production is the government’s broadest measure of activity in manufacturing and related fields like mining. It is generally timed well to the business cycle, or can sometimes slightly lead it as it can reflect businesses’ estimates of consumer demand for durable goods in the near future. It is also subject to fewer revisions than many other data series.
Personal consumption expenditures This measures household consumption of all kinds and goods services, which represents about 70 percent of gross domestic product. This variable is often strongly correlated to consumer confidence. But it arguably provides for a more tangible measure of the consumer, as it reflects how they are actually behaving with their dollars.
Inflation. Inflation, as measured through the Consumer Price Index, is the fifth economic variable in the model. Some of the academic models include measures of inflation and some do not. I think the case for doing so is reasonably clear. Inflation is among the most visible economic measures, and is among the most central in setting policy. It has also had a strong correlation with presidential approval ratings in the United States and has had a strong correlation with election outcomes in other countries.
The relationship between the inflation rate during the election year and election outcomes in the United States has been somewhat weaker, although when inflation is high — like in 1980 or in many elections before World War II — it usually has meant trouble for the incumbent president. Having one measure of inflation, as compared to six variables that measure growth, seems like a reasonable compromise.
Unlike for the other variables, higher inflation is worse for the incumbent, while lower inflation is better; the model, of course, considers this. However, our version of the variable gives a president no additional credit if the inflation rate is below 2 percent, since having a small amount of inflation is considered ideal by the Federal Reserve. A president gets no “extra credit” for deflation or near-deflation, in other words.
I get a lot of e-mail and Twitter questions about whether gas prices are included in the model. This is where they fit in, since gas prices will be reflected in the Consumer Price Index. Gas prices, of course, can also have indirect effects on variables like consumption.
The last two variables are forward looking.
Forecasted G.D.P. The model uses the forecast of gross domestic product growth over the leading two economic quarters (that is, not counting the current quarter) as taken from the median of The Wall Street Journal’s monthly forecasting panel. Right now, these forecasts continue to point toward fairly sluggish growth.
As I mentioned, I do not think it is wise to tweak your model endlessly based on fitting the past data in cases like this where the sample size is limited and the past data is very noisy. But I did look to see the relative value of current economic measures against forward looking ones.
We found that the current economic measures seem to have more value — perhaps, in part, because economic forecasting is a very rough science. But the forecasts do seem to provide some value if used in moderation.
Stock Market. Likewise, I found that the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, probably provides some value if used carefully.
The stock market has some unique virtues as a forecasting variable. It is available almost literally instantly, so something like relatively favorable resolution to the European debt summit — which might reduce the economic downside case for the United States in the second half of the year — can be reflected in the forecast almost literally overnight. And the stock market is not subject to revisions of any kind.
The downside is that sometimes the stock market shifts for reasons that have less to do with macroeconomic performance. Shifts in sentiment about Federal Reserve policy, for instance, can influence the market. And sometimes the movement in stock market prices may simply be irrational.
Still, all economic variables have their problems, and our finding is that a small dose of stock market data probably provides some useful information to elections forecasters. Moreover, although the market certainly gets things wrong some of the time, changes in the stock market tend to anticipate changes in several of the other six variables..
As I mentioned, the seven variables are weighted equally, with the exception of the stock market which is weighted slightly less. Specifically, the stock market represents 10 percent of the total index, whereas the other six variables each represent 15 percent of it. Still, since the stock market is updated daily and can change quickly, it may have a relatively noticeable effect on the forecast.
Why use these largely equal weights? There is support for doing so in the empirical literature on forecasting in cases where the sample size is small and the data is very noisy.
The alternative would be to set the weights by regression analysis, but the data is just not robust enough to do this. You wind up with a big mess when you try to test the relative importance of seven economic variables on 10 or 15 past elections.
Arbitrarily dropping variables may produce a cleaner-looking result, but they do not really prevent overfitting and are the equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig. We think accounting for a larger number of variables, but weighing them about equally, is the better choice.
There are a few other details that need to be resolved. The most important one is what time frame to use in evaluating the data series.
One of the points that the historical record is fairly clear on is that voters have a fairly near-term focus when it comes to the economy. Almost no matter what variable you use or how you specify your model, there just is not much evidence that the economic performance of a president in his first two years in office matters much by the time you get to Election Day. (Some statistical models, in fact — although I do not personally find them all that plausible — even claim that poor economic performance during a president’s first two years in office may help him. )
With that said, one cannot get too cute about this. Economic data, as we have mentioned, is quite noisy — certainly from month to month and even from quarter to quarter. And if voters are forward looking in their outlook, they can still take some time to parse the changes in the data (as can the news media and economists).
I decided to focus on economic data that looks at the performance of the economy over roughly the past half-year — although the implementation of this gets a bit more complicated to work around another thorny complication in economic modeling.
Below is a chart showing the progression of real personal income over 2004 and 2005. Note that there is a big spike in one month, December 2004, which coincided with a large one-time dividend payment made by Microsoft.
In addition to speaking to how personal income can be a problematic data series to begin with, this spike would also create problems for you if you were trying to measure the change in personal income at some later date. For instance, if your model was based at looking at the change in personal income over six months, it would look like something very bad had happened in June 2005, since this would be exactly six-months after the one-time spike. Then in July 2005, the index would suddenly appear to be rising at a healthy clip again.
The solution is to make these comparisons on a rolling basis. Our model calculates the change in each variable at intervals ranging from one month to one year. In other words, it calculates the one-month change in the variable, the two-month change, the three-month change, and so forth, then averages these results together after normalizing them to have the same standard deviation. The result is generally similar to the six-month change, but more robust to short-term blips in the data.
A slight variation is used in the procedure for the stock market. Because the stock market is not subject to measurement error, the model just uses the close of the S&P 500 from the most recent trading day. It then calculates the growth rate in the stock market by comparing this value to that on each of the past 252 trading days on a rolling basis as described above. (Why 252 trading days? That’s the average number of days that the stock market is open during a calendar year, excluding holidays, weekends, and so forth.)
In addition, since all the economic measures are on different scales, they are normalized such that they have the same mean and standard deviation. For purposes of legibility, the index is then scaled such that it has the same mean and standard deviation as quarterly changes in gross domestic product. So a value in the low-to-mid 3’s represents an economy that is growing at an average rate, while readings at 0 or below are recessionary.
Right now, the different components of the index read as follows.
(Keep in mind that these are normalized rather than raw values. Moreover, as I mentioned, the value for inflation is inverted before being normalized, since lower inflation tends to help incumbents.)
Right now, the index reads at 2.5 percent, which means that the economy looked at as a whole is clearly below-average, but not recessionary. There are some bright spots in the data, like the relatively strong rate of industrial activity, very low inflation (in part because of declining gas prices), and a stock market that signals the possibility for a more favorable flow of data in the second half of the year.
On the other hand, growth in income has been very poor — consistent with recessionary conditions, in fact — and consumption has been sluggish. And if the stock market has been bullish lately, the G.D.P. forecasts put out by economists are not so much. The Wall Street Journal panel expects G.D.P. growth of 2.3 or 2.4 percent in the second half of the year, which our model translates to a figure of 1.7 percent after normalizing it.
The normalized value for jobs growth (2.6 percent), interestingly, is right in the middle of these bearish and bullish indicators and almost exactly matches our economic index as a whole. This is another reason this Friday’s jobs report is especially interesting; the jobs figures have often seemed to be the “swing vote” in determining whether the economy is getting back to about average growth or slowing down yet again.
With that said, part of the value of building an economic index is that it allows you to avoid getting overly fixated on any one data series, or any one data point. We think we have developed a reasonably well-balanced measure of the economy, which is fairly resistant to noisy data, and which reflects the different types of economic activity that voters will encounter.
In addition, our focus on using real time rather than revised data provides for a more apples-to-apples comparison to previous years. Here is how the economic index would have looked in past elections since 1968, at a range of intervals up to 250 days before the election.

When I ran for the Town Board last year, I was focused on becoming the only Democrat on the board. Halfway through the election when a newspaper reporter asked me what I thought about becoming the only woman on the Board, I was momentarily stumped. Here in the Ithaca area, we're a tad further along the road to enlightenment than some others places. Women's issues were not uppermost in my mind.
Recently Irene Stein, from the Tompkins County Democratic Committee, invited me to participate in Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Campaign School. I felt like I'd been invited by Eleanor Roosevelt herself and I jumped at the chance. We met tonight for introductions.
The training, designed by people at Emily's List, is designed to encourage pro-choice, Democratic women to run for office and win. Emily's list was started in the 1980s at which time no Democratic woman had ever been elected to the US Senate in her own right. EVER! In fact, of 1,889 people who have served in the US Senate since its inception in 1789, only 33 are women. Of 10,546 members of the House of Representatives, 203 are women.
Why so few? According to a Brown University study (pdf) "women are significantly less likely than men to view themselves as qualified to run for office. In addition, women are less likely than men to receive encouragement to run for office from party leaders, elected officials, and political activists."
Does it matter? Well, more than half of eligible voters in the US are women. 15% of the 109th Congress are women. Let's find out if women can make a difference. People at Emily's List and the Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Committee are working hard to recruit qualified women and support their campaigns. If you're a woman, think about running for office. If not, donate to Emily's list and ask a woman you know to run.
Seriously, find out who your local, state and national representatives are and when their terms expire. If you need help with this, email me. Find your local Democratic Committee. Go to a town board, city council, county or state legislature meeting and see what they do. It's hard work but its not rocket science. So, run! Or help someone run. Really. We need you. Get going!

Nice post. I hope it is inspirational to others! (Your link to dryden dems is for blogspog not blogspot - Oop!).
Oops! Thanks heaven for watchful readers. I've fixed the link.
I hate to say it but (there have been two occasions when I have been invited to get involved running for a local office...) I am not prepared to take the garbage that comes along with the job...
I admire women who run for office and serve and I send you and each of them lots of cheers but I do not want the libel and slander or the pain for my family.
I don't mean to be negative but I do know this issue has been a factor for a number of very talented women.
By the way congratulations on the participation in the Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Campaign School!

Medicaid Flexibility Still Missing from Wyden-Brown
On Monday Politico ran a column by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) taking issue with my critique of his proposal to accelerate the granting of waivers under Obamacare. Unfortunately, he missed a central point I was making about limitations on the waivers that could be granted.
Apparently the senator was offended by this paragraph, from my New England Journal of Medicine piece on his bill:
Even more problematic to proponents of state flexibility on both the left and the right is that states would not be able to fold other health programs into their waiver request. Liberal skeptics at the Physicians for a National Health Program, for instance, point out that provisions of Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), Taft–Hartley plans, and other programs could not be waived, leaving large obstacles in the path of a potential single-payer system. And on the other hand, by leaving Medicaid intact, including the required expansion of the program under the ACA, Wyden–Brown does little to comfort conservatives who envision a privatized voucher approach.

House Hearing: Secretary Sebelius Talks Fiscal Responsibility and Obamacare
Yesterday, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on the President’s fiscal year 2012 budget and implementation of Obamacare. The Secretary’s remarks highlighted the need for fiscal responsibility and health care reform that gives greater power to individuals and more flexibility to the states. Unfortunately, none of these goals can be achieved under Obamacare.
Sebelius told the committee, “We can’t build lasting prosperity on a mountain of debt. And we can’t win the future if we pass on massive debts to our children and grandchildren. We have a responsibility to the American people to live within our means so we can invest in the future.” (Read the rest at The Foundry…)

The Heat Report: 19.03.13
CALGARY -- The road to the 2013 Calder Cup Playoffs just got a little more difficult for the Abbotsford Heat.
Though the Heat hold down the eighth and final playoff spot in the American Hockey League's Western Conference, Abbotsford has just a one-point edge on teams situated nine through 11. That's the good news for the top affiliate of the Calgary Flames.
The bad news? Each of those three teams holds a significant games played advantage over Abbotsford. The Oklahoma City Barons, currently ninth, have played six fewer games than the Heat. The Milwaukee Admirals have played five less games to this point in the schedule while Abbotsford has played three more games than the 11th place Rockford IceHogs.
The Heat didn't help their cause over the last week, either, dropping two of three contests to close out a seven-game road trip that yielded just three points after going 2-4-1.
There is an opportunity to salvage some points back in Abbotsford, though. The Heat play a back-to-back set against the IceHogs on the weekend in a series that could go a long way to putting some space between themselves and the trio chasing them.
BAERTSCHI FINDS SCORESHEET
The Flames hoped a demotion to the Heat would help ignite Sven Baertschi's offense.
After three scoreless games, the first-year pro exploded for a goal and an assist in Abbotsford's 5-4 shootout win over the San Antonio Rampage on Sunday, pushing his season totals to seven goals and 20 points in 25 games. Baertschi initially had an assist on Brett Carson's sixth goal of the season that was later given to Roman Horak.
Though he's played just over a third of Abbotsford's games this season, Baertschi is sixth in team scoring.
TAYLOR RECALLED
With Flames goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff expecting his second child, Daniel Taylor was recalled to join Calgary on their three-game road trip against the Dallas Stars, Nashville Predators and Columbus Blue Jackets.
Kiprusoff is expected to rejoin the team in Nashville, however.
Taylor earned his first career National Hockey League victory in his last stint with the Flames, stopping 29 of 31 shots against the Vancouver Canucks on March 3rd.
In 31 games with the Heat this season, Taylor is 14-10-2 with a 2.96 goals against average and .924 save percentage.
ROLLHEISER INKS PTO
With Taylor's recall and Leland Irving undergoing minor elective surgery, the Heat signed Grant Rollheiser to a professional try-out on Sunday.
Rollheiser has played 19 games this season with the Utah Grizzlies of the ECHL and another six with the Wichita Thunder of the Central Hockey League. He was originally drafted in the sixth round of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Why.
There’s a big gap between having one of the best teams in the AHL and having one of the best teams in the NHL, a real and spectacular gap.
The former does not guarantee the latter. To cite just one example, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers had three brilliant years in the AHL in the early 2000’s (finishing first in the league in the regular season in 2001-02), and we all know how that turned out for their parent club, the New York Islanders.
Tyler Dellow went on about this at some length late in January, when a few of Edmonton’s more prominent media people wrote articles on the successes of the Barons. I’ll quote his conclusion:
It seems to me that the onus in proving that something matters is on those who assert that it does. There’s lots and lots of reason to think that your AHL team’s record has little to do with whether you’ll be a good team down the road or whether you’ll develop players effectively – I’ve only scratched the surface above. If people like Spector and Jones want to make the case that Tambellini should be praised for turning into the Barons into a powerhouse, it seems to me that they should explain why I should give the slightest damn as an Oilers’ fan. As far as I can tell, it’s irrelevant, or close to it. Unless, of course, you’re a hockey team desperate to draw the eye away from the flaming wreckage of another season and distract minds from questions about why you’re still employed. In that case, a good AHL team is probably incredibly relevant to you. It’s a justification for further employment that people who don’t dig into things might accept.
When I read Tyler’s piece, I was generally in agreement with it. I was aware of good AHL teams with terrible NHL parent franchises, and vice versa. On the other hand, it also seemed to me that a strong AHL organization was probably something of a positive; after all, as with the NHL there’s a need to assess, recruit and then coach talent, and some of the players contributing in the AHL are bound to contribute in the NHL down the road. It would seem to make a logical sense that a team winning in the AHL employs better people in coaching and development, and that some of the players helping their team win would make the leap.
So I went out to try and see, one way or the other, if I could find evidence that success at the AHL level led to success at the NHL level. To answer the question, I looked at three seasons worth of AHL data: 2005-06, 2006-07, and 2007-08. I didn’t use earlier seasons because of the lost lockout year, and I didn’t use later seasons because there hasn’t been enough time since.
Goal Differential Correlations
The following table shows the correlation between the success of an AHL team (measured by goal differential) and its parent NHL club (also measured by goal differential). “Same season” denotes the correlation between the AHL team and the NHL team in the same season, while “Season+1” represents the correlation between AHL success one year and NHL success the next year (e.g. 2005-06 AHL team, 2006-07 NHL team), and so on. A perfect correlation is 1.0.
The most significant outlier to this pattern is the Atlanta Thrashers/Chicago Wolves affiliation; Chicago was highly successful for many years, while Atlanta no longer has an NHL team. Interestingly, the Wolves were not owned by the Thrashers but rather by a pair of Chicago-area businessmen and retained significant control over hockey operations under the Thrashers.
It’s interesting to note that there appears to be a link between a good AHL organization and eventual NHL success. I say “appears” for a number of reasons; firstly, I can’t think of a definitive reason for such a strong link, and secondly I’m dealing with just three years of AHL data here.
Why would such a link exist?. That’s certainly a positive sign for the Oilers organization.
I agree that a good AHL team certainly doesn't hurt, and that the oilers needed their own affiliate in the AHL.
I wouldn't overstate the significance of a good AHL team, however. Although I don't follow the barons closely, my sense this season has been that their success was largely driven by veteran AHL players who are relative long shots to make it in the NHL (e.g. both goaltenders and Cornet).
Of course it's good to put guys like Pitlick, Pajaarvi, Lander, Teubert, and Plante in that environment for development purposes - but if your big minutes guys aren't going to be NHLers, and your AHL success is driven by AHL lifers, then I can see where Dellow is coming from.
It matters
JDD is the perfect reason why you need a farm team Development is the reason you instill winning. Stability also keeps players focused on development.
Obviously there is a big difference if the AHL success it due to a goup of super prospects or a team of grizzled AHL vets. Is it possible to do some sort of historical correlation based on the age of 'the players driving the bus'* and then see where the barons fit?
* Stolen from Lowetide without expressed written consent.
Is it possible that being with a winning AHL team instills good attitudes and a desire to win whereas bad teams get used to losing? In the words of George Steinbrenner, "It only takes one thing to be a good loser, plenty of practice".
Agreed. The fact that the Barons are winning is a nice bonus, but the real story is that the development system has been completely overhauled in the last few years.
I think the most hopeful sign is that the joke that was the Oilers farm team through most of the 2000s seems to have been a key predictor of the past 3 yrs results.
The hiring of up and coming coaches, creating a winning atmosphere and the appearance that young defenseman are improving down there, seems to indicate the organization at least has a clue.
I'm assuming it does not help a young goalie get confidence if he is facing 50 shots a night so that alone makes a better AHL team important. My biggest hope is that a playoff run in the AHL will help Paarjarvi, Lander and Pitlick develop into solid NHLers in the next couple of years.
In trying to see if an AHL success leads to NHL success you need to factor in a development delay. I would expect AHL success and help to the NHL team would peak about 3-5 years after the AHL peak.
@Sheldon "Oilers Fan for Life!!!"
It seems to be three years; with the years I looked at there was pretty minimal correlation after that time.
That would be a great argument if there was any way to confirm that he would've turned out any better had he been in a system that had its own farm team. There are hundreds (well, lots anyway) of highly toughted goalies and high draft picks who played for organizations who had their own affiliates and still never panned out.
In his first pro season, the Oilers did have their own their affiliate. JDD played well in the ECHL but was 6-13-2 with a .888 SV% for the Roadrunners.
You could maybe say he was shafted the following year with the Bulldogs where he only got into 13 games, but Halak and Danis severely outplayed him.
In Wilkes/Barre he was clearly the team's #1 despite being another team's affiliate.
The following year was when the Oilers got their own affiliate (Springfield) and he was handed the #1 job.
So out of 4 years, 2 of them were in another team's affiliate, and only one of them was he not the starting goalie.
EVERYDAY I'M DITHERIN'
A strong minor league team can't hurt, but it doesn't necessarily mean that your parent club will be a smashing success either.
I'm a happier Oiler fan knowing that the team has been successful in March (despite a sub .500 season overall) than knowing that their minor league affiliate is the second best team in the AHL.
If next year, Paajarvi, Lander and at least one defenceman returns to the big club and makes an impact on the roster, than I'm willing to give more credit to the development of the minor league squad directly leading to the Oilers' successes, but until then, it's almost like comparing apples to oranges.
When you looked at the correlation did you examine if the AHL and NHL teams used the same play systems so the players could easily transition to the NHL with minimal new stuff to learn. Is this much of an issue even?
This is an interesting article...so because the Barons are good this year, it will keep me hopeful for the Oilers for the next 3+ years!
Apparently I can run on hope for a while longer...I guess Tambi WILL keep his job!
@Sheldon "Oilers Fan for Life!!!"
There's really no way to find that sort of information.
Has anyone else heard the rumour from Elliotte Freidman that Matt Duschene is unhappy is Colorado. Just curious if one could do a swap of Sam Gagner for Matt Duschene, would you do it. Size wise there the same, Duschene is a better skater. This season Sam`s been way better, but in the past Matt eaten his lunch. Upside could be debatable. Any thoughts........
@Jonathan Willis
This is awesome analysis (I've often wondered about this myself), and supports the common sense idea that winning begets winning within an organization, but it should be said that 0.35 is pretty weak.
My inner geek is decidedly pleased that you have distinctly and intelligently separated two different concepts: correlation and causality. You can observe a correlation, but that does not determine cause and effect. So many people don't know the difference.
I am glad there is a correlation, since I am tired of watching the Oilers suck.
Many of the present Baron players credit the success they are having with the quality of the present coaching staff. Are they using the same systems as the Oilers? If so the success should translate up at least some. If he is such a great coach Would it be worth paying a higher salary to avoid some NHL team poaching him?
I'm not so sure the bond between winning at the AHL level and winning at the NHL level is so great. I think a better way to see would be to find out how many legit NHLers AHL teams graduated and then look back to see how those teams fared in those seasons when the graduates played.
We are so much more concerned with individual successes from AHL players than from team success that I cant tell if winning isnt connected or if I just dont care about it.
Is it better for Hamilton and Pitlick to play fewer minutes in lesser roles on a winning AHL team or to get lots of ice-time and lose more often?
I think it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Meaning that despite a weak correlation, the causation that is implied is even weaker. This value is found by squaring the correlation value and is not very pretty for any of the three rows.
As a sidenote I wonder if there is any relationship between the way a non-playoff team plays in their last 15 or so meaningless games and their next season. To see if there is any basis behind this "carry the momentum forward" talk I see. Either way, I'm loving the baron's success and I'm loving the wins down the stretch. Dubnyk is finally playing his size
Is there a correlation in the baseball world? You would think that a strong minor league system would be beneficial to the parent club. You want your young prospects earning TOI against AHL vets. If they don't, they become a AHL vets. Drafting is key and more important than AHL success.
The 2 sports use their minor leagues differently. You don't often get freshly drafted 18 year olds on MLB rosters. They tend to make their way through the various minor league affiliates before getting their first chance as September callups in a lost season.
In the NHL, your best young players generally don't play many games in the AHL before coming to the NHL fulltime. Often times it's your bottom 6ers that spend a lot of time in the AHL.
Prime examples of AHL are Alzner,Carlson,Neuvirth and Johansson. Despite the year the caps are having they have been looked at to fill in key roles 1-2 years after graduating from the AHL.
Did he do too bad. Starter on one NHL team, back-up on another. Seems like hes done ok. I would argue that even if he developed in a more stable envirnment, I can`t see him doing any better then what he has done if he was playing for a better organization.
Every situation is kind of unique but given the lack of important games that the parent club has played over the past few years, a deep playoff run has to be a looked at as a positive for key youngsters like Lander, Paajarvi and Teubert.
@Smokey
I don't think Gagner gets you MD. How about Taylor Hall; damaged goods, as is with no returns? A big gamble for both sides, but I worry that Hall will have a short career unless he makes fundamental changes to his game.
Matt Duchene has 27 points this year. Has played on the third line, and has been outta sorts with management. You gotta wonder if they would take Gagner back straight up. I would take a flyer on the kid, but I honestly don`t watch the Av`s more then 6 games a year.
Say you could get him for a couple prospects such as MPS/Musil or Klefbaum/ Pitlick would you take a chance...I would...
@Smokey
I like Duchene, a real good fit here. For Gagner? absolutely. For prospects? Sure but I would hesitate to include derKlefbaum. I want to see just what we have first. Do you have the guts to send Hall away?
@ Willis; there's a strong and steady movement in the direction that supports the theory. Definitely worth revisiting in years +4 and +5.
My assumption is that a good AHL team provides good depth players for the big club. Maybe it's those depth guys that are the real difference between bad and good NHL teams?
Not willing to do Hall for MD. Maybe for MD and Elliott on defence, but thats a pipe dream.
It's not just the record that translates into winning in the show. There has to be an aura of success that demands nothing less than the very best attitudes and effort.
That doesn't guarantee success (e.g. Montreal) but the alternative, a laizzez faire, selfish what's in it for me, who cares attitude is a contagious disease that is difficult to eliminate.
It takes years to cure a team of complacency.
Gee...that sounds familiar...
I think that the correlation between a strong AHL club and the parent NHL franchise exists, it just isn't a sole determiner of NHL franchise success.
I think back to the Manitoba Moose and their dominance of the AHL for years. That team also carried on it's roster some of those cuddly, loveable Canuckleheads we are all so fond of.
The AHL farm team is a place where draft picks and prospects can develop a professional game against grown men and spend time seasoning.
I love the fact that the Barons are outperforming the Heat this year and both are clubs that are laden with veteran presence. The difference is that the Barons have interspersed their roster with some of the Oiler's own prospects in Pitlick, Hamilton, Plante, Teubert, etc. The Heat, by contrast, are making due with only a small handful of Flames hopefuls (Irving) and draft projects (Nemisz) and have had to go so far as to sign Krys Kolanos and Hugh Jessiman to try and stock up on talent.
I actually do give some credit to Tambellini for the performance of the Barons. I've been scanning around the league to see where other AHL teams are affiliated and to measure that against their NHL team's performance and for the most part the teams that are struggling to get by every year are also the ones that have poorly run AHL squads.
Detroit is often held up as the model upon which this franchise is being rebuilt. Detroit has used their AHL franchise in Grand Rapids extremely well. The team may not be a perennial Calder Cup candidate, but they do well and they incubate the Red Wings prospects allowing them to mature under the NHL clubs tutelage.
I have heard encouraging reports from sources like Lisa McRitchie on the Oiler's development team and think that, while I'll never point to the Barons as proof positive of this club's eventual success, it is one piece in a much larger picture that will, with luck, lead this team to another championship.
Thanks for the article, Willis.
As for Duchene, if Greg Sherman decides to let go of Matt Duchene for Sam Gagner and someone like Curtis Hamilton, then he is really starting to spin his wheels. Were he to do that I think he would be moving very close to the example that Dean Lombardi is setting in L.A. (patience lost and frantic, almost spastic moves to improve immediately). I'd take that deal.
Perhaps it is a case of not all strong AHL clubs translate automatically into winning NHL clubs - but all strong NHL clubs require depth and development from strong and well run AHL clubs.
Just another piece of the puzzle in other words, without losing sight of the fact that building a winning NHL team depends on far more than just building a championship AHL team.
Your AHL team need not be a winner and i think Dellow is right that it is irrelevant how they do in the playoffs, but as an NHL team you should certainly want to see a high compete level and development from your farm...
@Lexi
What farm team are you talking about? Oh... you mean the one JDD was on? Follow the oilers much?
Standard errors please. Statistical significance would strengthen your case.
I mostly agree. The benefits of a stable farm team should be obvious, but a winning one? However, if all you look at is how many players graduate than you have to allow for the crappiness of the team they're graduating to. Things start to get really complicated and subjective at this point.
The simplest way to see if AHL success matter is to do what Willis did- does a winning team at one level help a team win at another level? The answer: sorta, but it's hard to say how much or why. Farm teams are more art than science.

Vigeland Sculpture Park
Oslo, Norway
An artistic masterpiece - The human experience through nude sculpture
Vigeland Sculpture Park in
Oslo, Norway
is a world famous tourist destination that is visited by tens of thousands each year. With more than 200 nude sculptures in bronze, granite and wrought iron symbolizing the emotions and experiences of human life, Vigeland Sculpture Park is a must-see in Oslo.
Completed between 1939 and 1949, Vigeland Sculpture Park is filled with unique sculptures - Gustav Vigeland's lifework. Art lovers and photographers could easily spend several days here appreciating and contemplating Gustav Vigeland's view of the human experience.
The Monolith
is an imposing and captivating column towering 46 feet high and composed of more than 100 intertwined human bodies of all ages. Vigeland modeled the Monolith in the mid 1920s and stone carvers spent more than 10 years completing his vision. The Monolith is an incredibly intriguing piece that seems to beg for personal interpretation.
The Monolith is surrounded by 36 granite statues depicting the cycles of life and human relationships. The statues sit on various levels of the stars that encompass the structure. Because there are so many viewing levels and angles available, no two views are the same. Because of the multi-level design, the ever-present, captivating Monolith of human bodies is always in the background allowing even more room for personal interpretation of the cycle of life and human relationship statues.
The Fountain
is Vigeland's unique view of the interaction between humanity and nature. Six men of varying ages hold a basin above them allowing a curtain of water to cascade down around them. Surrounding the Fountain, there are sculptures of humans that seem to be embedded in trees. Men, women and children of all ages are intertwined in trees in amazing poses and combinations.
The Bridge
features 58 bronze sculptures seated on granite parapets on the sides of an actual 100 meter long bridge. These sculptures represent and symbolize human relationships. Men, women and children in various poses seem to both symbolize and / or capture a specific moment in a human life: a mother holds her baby, a son looks admiringly up at his father, two young girls look off at some unknown object, a man cradles a baby, a man attacks another man, a woman holds the hand of a man as she rests her head on his shoulder, a man juggles his children.
One of the most famous and most photographed bronze sculptures on the Bridge is
Sinnataggen, the little Angry Boy
. The chubby, little child is caught in mid-step and apparently in the middle of a temper tantrum.
The Wheel Of Life
is a symbol of eternity. It is "a garland of women, children and men holding on to each other." According to the Vigeland Park literature, the Wheel Of Life "sums up the dramatic theme of the entire park: Man's journey from cradle to grave, through happiness and grief, through fantasy, hope and wishes of eternity."

The W. D. Holley Plant Environmental Research Center (PERC), located at 630 W. Lake Street on the Colorado State University campus, has been in operation since 1971. In 1992, Dr. James E. Klett began his role as Director of PERC and became the Faculty Coordinator for the trial program. David Staats also joined the department around this time as a Horticulture Research Associate. Together Dr. Klett and David Staats orchestrate all of the activities required to produce a beautiful garden and successful trial program each year.
The Pansy Trial program was initiated in 2003 to evaluate the capability of various Pansy and Viola varieties to overwinter in the Northern Colorado climate. The trial is also considered to be a Cool-season Crop Overwintering Trial, as we have trialed other genera, such as Delphinium and Dianthus, in the past. The relatively new Perennial Trial was initiated in the fall of 2006 at the request of our advisory committee. The intention of this trial is to test only newer perennial cultivars introduced in the past three years or less.
Year after year, the number of participants in the trial and the number of entries in the trial grew, leading to the demand for more and more space. In 2000, the Annual Flower Trial Garden was moved from its site at PERC to the park on Remington Street that is just across from the newly remodeled CSU Center for Arts, which was the old Fort Collins High School building. The relocation of the garden to this more spacious and visible site furthered its mission by more effectively extending education, research and outreach to students, home gardeners, Master Gardeners, community members and Green Industry personnel. The 2.9 acre park features an additional 5,000 square feet of bedding plant space, resulting in 20,000 total square feet of bed space available for planting. The relocation project was completed in five phases.

This question came up on a thread in the Lounge yesterday, as an aside to the topic of Reclining/Not reclining seats.
I'm not a smoker and it seems to me that it must be something like 20 years since the last of the international carriers banned it. I know it has been banned on all planes in Australia for ages, but I haven't done enough internal flying in other countries to know what the rule is in some of the less regulated areas.
Google throws up some info from 2011 that seems to suggest few if any international carriers allow it.
So I thought I'd ask the experts over here.
Thanks all.

Do any airlines allow smoking on board?
This question came up on a thread in the Lounge yesterday, as an aside to the topic of Reclining/Not reclining seats.

There are no USA carriers allowing it.As someone who works as a flight attendant, I think that due to codeshares,etc. most airlines would not allow it.
Ironically, there are flight attendants who never smoked who are being diagnosed with lung cancer-those flights from decades ago were absolutely horrible to work so no surprise on whats happening!
Thanks duty free. It must have been appalling to have to work in that smelly, smoky atmosphere. It was bad enough being a passenger - everything I wore or took as a carry on was saturated with the odor & it took a very thorough scrub to get it out of my hair & skin.
Apart from the health benefits - I'm delighted not to travel in or arrive smelling like, a portable ashtray.
Do you happen to know when the US banned it, and did they ban international & domestic at the same time?
Bokara2,
All it really takes is one click on google for the answer.
I love the point where big tobacco says it's an intrusion on individual rights.
Thanks Rastaguy, but I was really looking for info in a wider scale than just the US.
I don't think any airlines allow it now but I remember in the past a lot of airlines would ban smoking except on flights to Japan.
The last smoking flight I recall, was when I flew on KLM around 1996 from Hong Kong to Amsterdam. I did hear a story of a passenger in China who had a non-smoking seat and immediately after take-off the 2 passengers either side of him started to smoke, when he inquired to the hostie she said that's correct, they are in smoking seats and you're in a non-smoking seat
>big tobacco says it's an intrusion on individual rights.<
That's funny, I always thought smokers infringed on my individual rights to breathe clean air..........
I was one of those who was doing the happy dance when airlines (and all of the restaurants in my home state) prohibited smoking!
In 2007 I took a domestic Egyptian flight from Aswan to Abu Simbel and the smoky smell was awful. I don't remember the name of the airline but I don't think it was Egypt Air. It brought back memories of the no-so-good old days when all flights were so bad.
Thank God it was only a 30 minute flight.
I remember as an eleven year old not being able to see down the aisle of an Avianca flight due to the smoke. It really was that bad.
No wonder I have such bad asthma. And I never smoked.
In Florida, you can still smoke in a bar as long as they don't serve food. Florida is years behind Europe.
BAck in the day, PSA Airlines had one side of the aisle for smoking and the other for not. Really great when a guy lit up a cigar.

Hi,
I will be going to Hong Kong in August with Macau being my final destination. However, I will be arriving very early in the morning...5am is when my flight arrives. I went on the turbojet website and see conflicting information on what time their first ferry is from HKIA...one section shows 08:15 and another one shows 10:00. I don't mind waiting for the 08:15 ferry, if that's even accurate. Can someone advise what would be the quickest way to get to the Macau ferry terminal other than waiting at the airport for several hours for the ferry service to start...I will be travelling with one suitcase. Thanks!

going from HKIA to Macau
Hi,
7 Replies | Jump to last reply |
Fastest - Airport Express train to HK station, then walk or taxi over. The walk is about half a mile. First train 5:54a. HK$100 for the train. 24 minutes. Add 10 minutes walk or a few minutes on the taxi.
Or just take taxi. About HK$300. ~35 minutes.
Cheaper alternative is Cityflyer bus A11. HK$40. About 40 minutes. First bus at 6:10a. No point getting to Ferry Terminal too early, as the 15-min frequencies only start at 7a. The sailing before 7a is at 6a.
BTW, first Turbojet service from HKIA to Macau is at 10:00a (which goes to Taipa over the bridge). Regular service to Macau starts at 11:00a.
What you should be doing (and what I believe rkkwan is alluding to above) is taking a ferry directly from HKIA to Macau Airport. You don’t need to go into Hong Kong proper to then get a ferry to Macau. (That would be backtracking in the first place, as you will pass HKIA again on your way out to Macau). The other advantage is that you don’t have to go through Hong Kong Immigration; you will go right from the plane to the ferry. Your checked bags go automatically too, you collect them in Macau. All in all, this is usually faster and easier than trekking through HK Immigration, going into Hong Kong with your bags, and then getting a ferry from there. See
But with a 5 am arrival time, it is a bit of a toos-up as to whether watiting at HKIA for 5 hours for the first ferry at 10 am is better than going into Hong Kong to get the 8:15 am ferry (which you could make, assuming no long lines at Immigration and no significant wait for your bags.) Take a look at
You probably are seeing two times because the 8:15 departure is from Hong Kong Island ferry terminal, and the 10 am departure is from HKIA itself. (Actually, on the Turbojet site, I see that ferries start running at 7 am and depart every 15 minutes.)
If you wait at HKIA, there are plenty of restaurants there, and day lounges where you can pay to take a shower, etc.
thanks rkkwan and cicerone for your replies. After flying for about 15 hours, I think I would be quite eager to get to my destination rather than waiting around at the airport for 5 hours. I've read somewhere that there are different coloured taxis and one has to be sure to get the right one since they are desginated to stop only at certain points...is this true? Also, does the cityflyer bus go directly to the macau ferry terminal or does it make stops along the way? thanks!
For taxi to the city, you need to take the red one.
The Cityflyer A11 has two immediate stops before the Macau Ferry Terminal, at the transit stops before the Tsing Ma Bridge and before the Western Cross Harbor Tunnel. The very first stop after it gets to the city IS the Macau Ferry Terminal. Cannot get more convenient than that.
You want a red cab, either to Hong Kong Island if you want the Macau Ferry Termnial, or to Kowloon/Tsim Sha Tsui for the China Ferry Terminal (see below). The different coloured taxis go to different areas of Hong Kong, but don’t worry; there is zero chance you will get in the wrong one. In the first place, at the airport they are assigned to different waiting areas. There are dispatchers at each area as well, and this is a further backstop against getting in the wrong cab. Finally, if by some very odd chance you got in a blue Lantau cab and told him your address on Hong Kong Island, he would just tell you to get out of the cab. He can’t take you there. This is something that the guidebooks seem to want to make into a big deal, but really it is just not possible to take the wrong cab. The drivers won’t let you. (The only place this is theoretically possible is with red cabs once you are ON Hong Kong Island or in TST, but I won’t go into that as it won’t happen to you coming from the airport.)
One more way to consider going is to take the Airport Express train to the Kowloon Station (25 minutes), then hop a taxi to the China Ferry Terminal in Kowloon/Tsim Sha Tsui (3 minutes or so, just under HK$20) and take the New World First Ferry to Macau. There are ferries about every half hour starting at 7 am. I think you would be able to make a 7:30 am ferry, and with some hustle, even the 7 am. See for info.
This would be marginally faster than going to the Macau Ferry Terminal on Hong Kong Island proper by taxi, and IMO better than walking with luggage from the Hong Kong Airport Express station to the Macau Ferry Pier (it’s bloody hot in August, even if the walkway is covered, and not something I would want to do with a suitcase. It could also be poring with rain and bloody hot.) Personally, as a first-timer to Hong Kong, I think it will take you quite a while to figure out the walk, as you have to up and through a mall and then out along a very long pedestrian walkway, and signage is not good. And not a whole lot of people around at 6:30 am or so.
I know very little about the bus options. I am not a fan of buses when I have luggage. Otherwise the bus system here is great, although this will probably be your slowest option from the airport.
If the OP can get the first Cityflyer A11 bus at 6:10a, he can get to the Macau Ferry Terminal on HK Island not later than 6:55a. Enough time to catch the 7:15a Turbojet. With its higher speed than NWFF's ferries, he'll get to Macau no more than 10 minutes later than the 7:00a NWFF.
Single ride from airport, basically door-to-door. No need to transfer to taxi. And cheaper, for just HK$40.

The city has been super hot lately and that has gotten me in the mood for some songs that both reflect and (hopefully) deflect the heat. Two of these songs have already made an appearance on this blog (Songs for Summer No. 1, June 5, 2011 and Songs for Summer No. 3, June 9, 2011) for heat-related reasons but both deserve a second listen. Chill Out reminds me so vividly of the Lower East Side in the heat and also all of the people slogging their way through the park searching for a little shade. Second and Dryades reminds me of Harlem more than anywhere else, especially all of the people in the shade in the community gardens playing dominoes.

Almost Real — Ben & Jerry’s Boba Fett’s Carbonite Crunch
Boston, MA artist Jonny etc is at it again with his Ben & Jerry’s ice cream fan fiction, this time with Star Wars’ Boba Fett at the helm of his artistic expression. The fictional new flavor is complete with vanilla ice cream, salted caramel swirl and chocolate Han Solos frozen in carbonite (the crunch has to come from somewhere!).
Last time we covered Jonny etc’s work we were exploring his Ron Swanson-flavored Ice Cream, but now we get a look at his inter-galactic new flavor: Boba Fett’s Carbonite Crunch. Anyone think it’s time for Ben & Jerry’s to actually commission Jonny etc for some R&D? [Via BreakfastSafari]

My favorite line: "It’s your choice whether you want to let the rest of the world know we exist - it's a great opportunity for a lot of people to really start to learn about what real dining is about." Take that, chefs that use your real names!
I'll resist the immediate temptation to "critique" this video, and its not-so-mysterious, sky-diving, cocktail-drinking, secret-password-giving chef/prophet mastermind - and will instead let you tell me, in your typically fair and balanced way, what you think of this.
By the way, since I'm assuming this video is really some sort of desperate cry to be outed, if you know the identity of Dissident Chef and his band of merry faux-foodie hipsters, please do tell.

It would be a lot easier to keep a secret by not shooting a TV show about it.
yeah, that's what I was thinking. It's like hey, tell everyone you know not to tell anyone.
asides from being really arrogant, what exactly is your problem with this guy? i mean it sounds like a cool enough idea.
The stuff he bragged about didn't look all that good to me.
He's too cute ...(but not as cute as you, Chef John!)
I especially liked the part where he tasted the sauce then shook the spoon off back in the pan. Great technique, got to keep that under wraps, don't want anyone else copying that!
Luisa Vacaville
no problem with him at all, I hope he makes millions. I like my Arch-Nemeses easy to mock, and this guy's a dream come true. I hope he starts mocking my stuff (secretly, of course)
Good news - your arch nemisis may also be a neighbor:
You could infiltrate his secret lair if you wanted to. . .
LOL, that didn't take long! Well, looks like I need a new arch-nemesis already.
Who cleans up after this guy after he cooks? His work area was a mess.
To me, it's a sort of Ueber-cliche thing, for those bored of scoring seats in the latest, hottest resto. In and of itself, it's as dull as chasing that latest, hottest resto.
The marketed exclusivity of it is more obnoxious than the exclusiveness of the concept.
And of course, that the concept is marketed means that some mohawked genius will have to think of the next great thing, which might be:
*Unpasteurized Milk Maids Gone Wild!
*Foie Gras Follies! or, La Cage au Foie!
*Blowfish Bordello!
*Super-Secret Siam Satay: The Monkey Session!
*Secret Super-Egos on Parade: Those Passive-Aggressive Bay Area Chefs
*Chilaquiles, Pork Belly and Viagra: What Serious Eats Won't Show You on TV!
*Cheap, Replaceable Pans: The Seamy Side of Anthony Bourdet
The possibilities of viral-marketing a supposedly secret concept are really endless. Think up your own! Me, I'm thinking the CIA (the spooky people, not the cooking people) could recruit spies through a technique like our mohawked maestro used.
Jeez, take it easy... I'm going to have to start defending him now.
What is faux graw? and why would it be outlawed?
That was a bit too much reality tv for me. I like the learning experience i get out of cooking shows. There wasn't enough information. Just little tidbits.
I really think that truly and really good dining should also be the most simply and easily enjoyed. A few twists here and there to keep things interesting are welcome, but it's an entirely different story if I have to make ten phone calls to get the password to a location where I'll eat secretly...no thanks.
And this makes for a better dining experience how?
I'm over it.
And this makes for a better dining experience how?
Wow how pretentious, I would pay not to eat at this guys oh so special restaurant. Sorry if that comes across too harsh but sheesh! He needs to get over himself.
Maybe I'm a niave foodie, but Why are some of these dishes "illegal" in some states--do they come from china? I also find it lame filming yourself doing 'illegal' activities, it must be some kind of nutritional defect that makes people think they are 'cool' instead of a fool. If he really wanted to introduce people to what he calls 'fine dining' or good food, then he open a bistro of his own. But the fact that he doesn't seem to have a job or credentials as a chef somewhere except in his own mind and ego makes him just another poser in my book. The real chef to admire at this website is Chef John.
Whats up with 72 hrs @ 130? Sous Vide sounds interesting, very moist and tender, but isn't that holding it at the upper end of the danger zone for like 3 days? Why would the health department have a problem with that?
There was one of these underground restaurants in the Seattle area, and it was so 'secret' that it was featured on Bourdain's "no reservations" a year or so ago.
The legit part of the their business was an adult ed, hands on cooking school that I liked very much. They served several glasses of wine with the classes for years without a problem. Then one day the powers that be decided that could no longer happen without a permit. There is some thought that the regulators re-thought out policy on wine may be some degree of retribution for flaunting the mobile, uninspectable, unpermitted, non tax paying dining establishment.
The power struggle between the regulators and the business began. And it's ended how you would expect. I never made it to the secret restaurant.(I'm just not that into molecular gastronomy, or trout flavor marshmallows.) However I learned that bacon ice-cream works for me, and I will miss the now defunct cooking school.
FYI: my underground dining sources tell me he does have skills and has held "real" jobs before. I think we shall give him the benefit of the doubt regarding his cooking since we can't taste it. There is plenty of other stuff to kid him about!
No permits, licensing, regulations, full time staff, overhead or fixed venue. Who knew that most asian street food hawkers were at the cutting edge of cuisine? Next time I end up cooking dinner for a bunch of friends at another friend's apartment, I'll make everyone pay a share of the groceries and call it undergound dining. Without having personally handed me a cold beer (or at least offered to do so), you'll never get to taste my terribl-uhm-unique renditions of Chef John's recipes. Thats just how we roll here in the asian underground.
one of these days SWAT team will come to nail this perp - with the explosive entry through the kitchen wall. Chef, you mentioned that you know bunch of people in the law enforcement...
the whole pretense about buying a super-fresh sea bass three days before the secret dinner party is most likely a baloney. I bet he likes to serve sweetbreads, dark opulent ragout, liver with fava beans and big Amarone
I checked out BigAl's link above. Funny. The Chef mentions that he has an "amazing business plan." Now, I've been working for a non-profit company for the last 18 years... How the hell did his Groveling For Money file end up in the Amazing Business Plan folder? I hate when that happens... Oh sorry, I mean: It's "amazing" when that happens.
Scott - Boston
Somewhere between a b-list pro wrestler and some kind of annoying salesperson.
Wish he would just shut up.
Yeah, I hate people that grovel for money using videos... that reminds me, can you guys donate some money?
Nothing new here. The Ghetto Gourmet () began doing this in the Bay Area in 2004 - even appeared on the front page of the Chron at one point. Multi-city events at its high point. Gave lesser known chefs and line cooks an opportunity to shine.?
Also, I wonder if he puts a warning on the menu about the sous vide? Supposedly if it's not done in a precise manner there is a high risk of botulism, is that true?
there can be, but most of those risks (like raw eggs, etc) are over-blown. After seeing the things I've seen in kitchens, it can't be that common since there would be corpses laying all over the city.
What. A pretentious. Douche.
pretentious?? You're the one using French!.
These comments and the haters are hilarious.
It looks like a lot of fun, I bet he is full of tips and tricks someone in the business would appreciate.
Obviously the "hush hush" is THE advertising.
I wouldn't mind following him around for a month or so.
If your lucky he may let you pack his chute.
Dear Anonymous
I agree! I SCREAMED when he plopped the tasing spoon's leftovers back into the pan.

"faux graw" is fois gras, and is produced through seriously abusing geese or ducks via force feeding. It's also amazingly delicious. I'm conflicted.
Anonymous 4
Regulations require specific methods of cooking designed to prevent health risks (like "under cooking" by holding something at too low a temp so bacteria actually grow instead of being killed. This is why I can't get sous vide without bringing a lawyer along.)
OK - I'm going on too long. Sorry, Chef. I'm with you. I wish the guy had done all this in a Mexican wrestler's mask.
"Mexican wrestler's mask." Yes!! that would have been perfect!
hmmm.....
I think its genius. I mean, he seems to have found a way to have his own restaurant with out a lease/ mortgage/ health inspection.....
I guess its kinda cool that its all about the food.
Did they just go through a dave brubeck album for the soundtrack of this video?
This video is a bit dated, since the foie gras ban was repealed in Chicago last year. A lot of restaurants ignored it anyway. Storm in a teacup stuff. Yawn.
He's not doing anything amazing, just exclusive. It's a rave party for foodies. But beyond the narcissism there's an interesting question: what is "real dining?"
Is "real dining" at the heart of a technique like sous vide? Is it an exclusive subculture? An attitude?
I think Frank Black said it best:
"every thing was fine down here
what you call it here
call it what you will here
way down down down in this subbacultcha"
I'm allowed! I'm from Quebec. Please don't think I'm gauche.
are u guys still putting gravy on your fries?
A 10-second Google search (+"sub culture dining" +"san francisco") nets you quick results:
Looks like the Diss came out of the closet. His name is Russell Jackson:
This guy may cook, but I think he spends a lot of time in front of mirrors, preening. I work in Hollywood and I see actors , usually not very good ones, full of their own fabulousness like this guy. What's next... eye liner?
I think it's all a tad pretentious. If only we could all be so cultured. Maybe one day I can be a snob too.
Hey Chef John, will you cook something in a bag and make a video about it please? You did the sourdough vids and they took several days too...
Haha! I'm laughing out loud...
CJ, this is the most fun I've had on your site! (Except for that one time I learned how to made cheese.) Keep it up! :)

Just curious... This is a different app than fMMS, right? There's another app already in use by several people (myself included) that's been doing MMS (send and receive) for multiple file attachment types for some time now.
I'm always of the opinion that having more than one way to do something is nice. But wanted to make sure you (and others) knew there's another app out there to do this as well.
Yes it's a completely different application and we exchange tips all the time :-)

One Last Time, Again - Excerpt, Content Labels, Reviews & Discussion
EXCERPT:
“We haven’t seen each other in three years. I figured the occasion warrants a day off. And now that you’re done with your panel, we have a few hours to kill. I was thinking we could go back to your room, for old time’s sake.”
I start to say no, but then I change my mind, flash my key card, and beckon for him to follow me. By sheer luck, we’re alone in the elevator. I don’t waste any time pinning him to the wall and driving my tongue between his lips, my fingers clinging to his short blond hair. His cock rises with the elevator, and I grind him all the way up to my floor. My clit throbs, desperate for his touch, and it’s all I can do to walk down the hall to my room, rather than fucking him right there in the elevator.
“I still miss your pussy,” he whispers as I unlock the door. “And the way those green eyes of yours light up when I’m pleasuring you. There isn’t a day I don’t remember how amazing it was to eat you out, how beautiful you are when you come.”
I want to ask why, if he enjoyed me so much, he left in the first place, but I don’t want the answer, and I don’t want to kill the moment.
“Then what are you doing letting me stand here with my clothes on?”
Evan unbuttons my shirt carefully, and I can’t tell if he’s teasing me or he wants to savor the moment, but I have to admit that I like waiting. The longer he takes, the longer he’s with me. When my blouse is off, I unhook my bra and he catches my breasts in his waiting palms. Nobody else has these hands, nobody else plays with my nipples the way he does. He has all the finesse of someone hand-rolling a cigarette, and it sends shivers all the way down my body, into my cunt. I’ve explained his technique to my subsequent lovers, but none of them have ever been able to match it. With his thumb and finger pinching my nipple, I’m suddenly weak-kneed, my body contracting in an orgasmic prelude to what’s to come.

Keep Medicare Eligibility At Age 65By Jess Spar
Target: House Speaker John Boehner
Goal: Stop the House of Representatives from supporting the proposal to move Medicare eligibility from age 65 to 67.
As anxiety over the approaching “fiscal cliff” rises, House Speaker John Boehner has proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 as a potential solution. Estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, this would save over $110 billion over the next ten years, but at what cost? With the cost of healthcare at a high increase for those over the age of fifty, adding two years onto this could be a death sentence for many elderly people. Individuals in the 65-66 age range are at the cheaper end of the beneficiary range for Medicare, yet under the new policy would most likely have to seek out private insurance, which would prove a much more costly alternative. Businesses would be able to provide coverage as well, but this would also affect their profit margins, which many small businesses cannot afford. This will almost certainly lead to an increase in uninsured individuals, and potentially layoffs if the smaller businesses affected as well.
John Boehner’s “quick fix” to the government’s financial issues will simply shift costs from the federal government to employers, other sectors that pay for healthcare, and individuals aged 65 and 66. Those approaching the age of retirement will now be expected to stay in the work force for two more years with two less years of benefits despite the fact they have been assured throughout their lives that they will have these benefits at 65.
By signing this petition you are urging House Speaker John Boehner to consider the effects of altering the Medicare beneficiary age, and to help look for another solution to our country’s financial dilemma.
PETITION LETTER:
Dear Mr. Boehner,
I am writing to you to urge you to consider another solution to our country’s financial problems. I understand that you have proposed changing the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, and I am asking that you consider the negative effects this decision would have on our country’s elderly, as well as small businesses. By changing the Medicare age, you are simply shifting the financial burden from the government to employers and the elderly individuals themselves, and for many, this will not be an affordable solution. The change in Medicare eligibility will force individuals to look into more costly privatized healthcare solutions, and will increase out of pocket expenses for many small businesses that cannot afford to have this affecting their profit margin.
I ask that you aid in the effort to look for other solutions to the approaching “fiscal cliff,” and leave the burden from weighing on the shoulders of the elderly. They have worked hard for many years with the assumption that they could count on our country to support their healthcare needs at the age of 65, and now you are asking that the government take away that promise for an extra two years. Affordability of health care above the age of fifty is already an issue for many individuals with lower income, and this change could potentially leave a large portion of the elderly population uninsured. Please protect our elderly citizens and reconsider your proposal for the change in Medicare eligibility.
Sincerely,
[Your Name Here]

I’m not an energy drink kind of girl – never was. I work out on an empty stomach first thing in the morning (working out with food in my belly makes me want to hurl) and always feel energized. This is what works for me and it may very well work for you too – or maybe you need some breakfast before your workout. That’s fine! As my girl Kasey says, #beTRUEtoYOU!
Now, I’m going to totally contradict myself. And I’m totally okay with it. I blame the NRG Matrix team for making such a rockin’ product.
For those of you that are not familiar with NRG Matrix, it is actually a raw, organic energy drink made from mushrooms. Yep, mushrooms. Don’t be deceived by the modernized packaging. This stuff is the real deal, my friends. I will totally admit that I pre-judged this product. Kasey told me to check it out and, at first glance, I thought, “Ya, ya, ya, I have energy for dayyys. I don’t need this supplement stuff.” Forgive me, NRG Matrix. I was wrong and judgmental. Tisk tisk! And, for the record, this is not a supplement. It is a whole foods-derived energy drink!
What I love the most about NRG Matrix is the fact that it provides an affordable alternative to Red Bull, Monster, and all those other energy drinks that have been proven to have long-term negative effects on our bodies. NRG Matrix was created by a team of healthcare professionals and scientists seeking to create an honest, compassionate #plantPOWERed product that gives us long-lasting energy. Um, yes please.
The primary ingredient in NRG Matrix is medicinal mushrooms, which contain a key ingredient called cordyceps that has been scientifically proven to enhance exercise performance. Cordyceps does this by increasing the amount of oxygen delivered to our bodies and enhancing the production of ATP, a co-enzyme in our bodies that is responsible for energy transfer.
Here’s what the ingredient list looks like:
- Organic Medicinal Mushrooms grown in San Marcos, California (for lasting energy)
- Organic Extracts – Yerba Mate, Guarana, American Ginseng, Tumeric Root (for improved immune function)
- Vitamin Blend – Vitamin C, Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and B12, Vitamin D (derived from the Medicinal mushrooms!)
- Organic Stevia, Monkfruit
Impressive, huh? I love how every ingredient has a purpose. The monkfruit and stevia give NRG Matrix a delicious, mild citrus flavor.
I can really attest to the product. I’ve been using it every other day for the past two weeks and have been recording my energy levels. On the days that I drink NRG Matrix during my toning routines, I definitely notice a difference in my energy levels. I literally feel like I could go for hours! When I don’t drink NRG Matrix and just drink water, after about an hour, I’m ready to call it quits. Like I said, it’s the real deal and I would absolutely recommend it to everyone!
NRG Matrix is a powder that comes in a convenient pouch. I simply pour the packet into my Camelbak before filling it up with water. After a generous shake, you’re good to go!
So, what do you think? Would you like some NRG Matrix? Well, if you insist..
Thanks to the kind team at NRG Matrix, they’ve agreed to gift TWO readers with a 10-pack of NRG Matrix! All you have to do is leave a comment on this post telling me how you would incorporate NRG Matrix into your daily life. Entries will close on Saturday at 12:00 a.m. and the winners will be announced on Sunday. GOOD LUCK!
*Edited to add (thanks to reader, Kirsten!): You can purchase NRG Matrix online at their website here! Per packet (i.e. per serving), they’re almost $1.00 cheaper than the price of leading energy drinks in most stores.
Stay lovely,
Heather

THERE ARE TWO distinct ways of seeing a person’s faults: conviction and condemnation…
God convicts of sin, whereas Satan condemns. The divine purpose in addressing sin is to call us to repent so that we will become the people He created us to be. God’s motive in correcting us is pure love. But Satan’s motive in addressing our flaws is pure hate. The demonic intent is to produce despair, self-condemnation, and self-hatred because Satan’s goal is to decimate, destroy, and kill.
When we’re trying to persuade a person who is sinning to do what is right, our purpose must be like God’s. We must never correct in a way that reflects judgmental harshness, leading to despair and discouragement of condemnation. The motive of the heart must be: “I love you too much to see you do this. I want God’s best for you. Please repent before it’s too late.” Rebecca Manley Pippert, “Meekness: The Remedy for Anger,” A Heart for God, 185

Different File Formats Option for Downloadable Products
Hello! I'm selling music on my website, and I would like to offer the option of downloading the music in MP3 or FLAC format. I don't want to create different products for each format. Instead, I'd like to use one product and let the user choose either MP3 or FLAC. Is this possible?
Also, I am selling physical media too: vinyl records, to be exact. I would like for physical product to allow for the option of MP3 or FLAC download. My thought was to bundle the physical product with the digital product. In the end, I would like only two listings per album: digital edition (which you choose as MP3 or FLAC), and physical product bundled with a digital edition (which you choose as MP3 of FLAC).
Can I do this with Jigoshop?
Thanks for your help. :)
Keith
2 Posted by Keith on 09 Feb, 2012 08:15 PM
Looking at this again... and it would be ideal if I could create a downloadable product with MP3 and FLAC attributes, then assign a different downloadable file to each attribute. Any chance that can happen in a future release?
For now I'm just going to give them one ZIP file with both MP3 and FLAC. It will suck for bandwidth, and take longer to download, but it's the only way I can do it.
3 Posted by Keith on 17 Feb, 2012 02:03 PM
I'm still hoping there's an answer for this... I've been messing around with Jigoshop and looking through the knowledge base, but I can't seem to find a solution on my own.

One variable product, two variations. One for FLAC, one for MP3.

Tracking Encroachments has not received any gifts yet
Hey everyone!
We're currently working on an architectural research and design project based on the emerging megacity of Karachi in Pakistan. We're spending the first part of 2013 researching on site working with local people and we're planning to bring the findings and design proposals to london in the form of an exhibition which will be linked to a parallel exhibition in Karachi.
The project is concerned with the revival of a redundant railway, the KCR [Karachi Circular Railway] - the project is multi-faceted but primarily deals with research, design proposals and a small publication of our work.
We're looking to find a space in london, as central as possible. At the moment we are unsure of the size needed, but as architects I'm sure we can appropriate the space! [anything railway related would be really amazing...]
We're ideally looking at securing a venue for 2/3 weeks next summer, maybe as early as june. Would love to hear any suggestions, or advice, we're a bit new to this!
Thanks in advance guys, hopefully we'll be a worthwhile contribution to Meanwhile Space!

From what I remember when the picture originally came out I don't think anyone was ever able to get the exif data off of it maybe because we never had the original photo only the copy on photobucket or something but I by no means the expert on any of this. Also there is a lady who posts on the BB board I post on and she had a good friend who was in Puerto Vallarta for a week at that same time, they never saw Jeff and Jordan but they did say that although there was little celebrations through out the week the only big parade/celebration occurred on the 12th, it was on that street (we found screen shots on google maps of the exact corner they were standing on using the restaurant sign and another store sign in the background) and they blocked traffic for the parade...the 12th was also the only day traffic was blocked and people were allowed to just stand on the side of the road. I guess it was for some celebration for Our Lady of Guadelupe or something similar in name.
In episode 3, Mike and Louie received a one hour penalty for following a taxi cab driver to the Horse sense or Money sense Detour. They arrived at the mat in 7th place just ahead of Brent and Caite, but had to wait there for their penalty to run its course.This is particularly nice confirmation of what many of us have been hoping for...it is now against the rules to hire a taxi to follow, apparently.

Either credit for production difficulties, or unaired penalties or a combination. (As a for instance a 15-minute penalty and a 15-minute credit for production difficulties could offset.
That leg where we were in France, we had no sleep in twenty-four hours. Actually, that baguette in France was the first thing that we had to eat and I actually didn't drink anything for twelve hours. So you're sleep deprived, you're hungry, you're water deprived, and you're just exhausted.THE DEADBOLT: Was there anything from your time on the race you wish was aired, something that we didn't see?JOE: The Hamburg leg was a crucial leg where the cops [Louie and Michael] were actually at the end of the pack and their flight, low and behold, got them there earlier even though we were supposed to arrive an hour ahead. That was a turning point. Those are the chances that happen on the race.
so when we were in the long mandatory rest period after the Argentinean leg at that sheep ranch, we all spent a good 30 hours together And that was the only time we were not in a sequester mode where we could actually have meals together and have some conversations with the other teams. And yeah, we were all in very good spirits and we were trying to make the best of the situation, camping in Argentina and not having showers and things like that. It was a good time.
Reality TV World: So what happened during that ticket line incident, where you were holding spots in line? Joe Wang: Oh yeah, no, no. That was not "holding a spot," if you want to call it that. We were at the bus station and Brandy and Carol went with us. And then they ended up going to another station to make sure we had the best bus route. So for us we had to stick together as a team, and so I was in the front of the line and then Brandy and Carol ended up coming back and said "This is the best bus route." So because they were researching information for us, and we'd agreed prior to getting into line, that's what ended up happening. So the cops were not understanding the situation. We weren't holding any spots, they were already in line with us but they had to go and research for us too.
Joe Wang: We were trying our very best. I mean we were there for close to six hours and then it got dark and the weather changed dramatically, it started to rain. So I was giving Heidi a lot of shelter, her whole body was shivering. And if you remember, when we left we didn't have anything to eat or drink since 8:30AM. That was close to almost 12 hours.

Has anyone successfully implemented Declarative Caching with Spring Modules? I've checked out a few of the threads here regarding DC, but they seem incomplete (or not clearly explained). I also reviewed the documentation on the Spring Modules site and they seem to conflict (or are not up to date) with someone of the posts here. I'd like to see some example code of using DC with annotations. It'd be nice if Spring Modules provided actual code examples like the main Spring project. The issue with the schema definitions still seems to plague the project. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Hi.
I am using the Jdbc template as my database interface and now I want to read from my database using prepared statements.
In my program I iterate over lots of lines in a csv file and on every line I execute between 3 to 5 sql select queries with it the line's values. These select queries are the same for every line. So that would make 5 prepared statements as a whole.
Currently I sometimes use queryForObject or queryForMap. I'd like to have the same functionality, just with prepared statements to speed up the whole progress.
Now the problem: I just can't get the Jdbc template to work with prepared statements. Actually I even don't know how to do it.
There is the PreparedStatementCreator and the PreparedStatementSetter. As in this example both of them are created with an anonymous inner classes. But inside the PreparedStatementSetter class I don't have access to the values I want to set in the prepared statement.
Since I'm iterating through a csv file I can't hard code the values as a String. I also can't pass them to the PreparedStatementSetter because there are no arguments for the constructor. And setting the variables to final would in my opinion be dumb too.
I was used to the creation of prepared statements being fairly simple like this
as in the Java tutorial. But instead the jdbc template really is a pain so far.as in the Java tutorial. But instead the jdbc template really is a pain so far.Code:PreparedStatement updateSales = con.prepareStatement( "UPDATE COFFEES SET SALES = ? WHERE COF_NAME LIKE ?

I'd want my code to behave something like this.
I hope this pseudo code is helpful for you. Maybe you have some advice for me.I hope this pseudo code is helpful for you.

Hi,
I would like to know and understand how reader and writer work.
I use the following configuration:
<batch:tasklet>
<batch:chunk
</batch:tasklet>
In this case i will have 4 threads to execute this step. Are myReader and myWriter executed in the same thread ?
In my myReader class i read data from a simple table.
Is it necessary to split the table or to partition it so each thread will get its own data range ?
Or it is done automatically with this configuration ?
Thanks a lot

Restrict each server group to their own channel and no other?
How can you set up permissions so that each server group can only join certain channels and not others? What I mean is so you could have friends only going in the friend channels, family only able to go into the family channel etc..
From my understanding, because the join power (or any other power for that matter) go up incrementally and thus allowing more blanket access the higher the number someone has, how can you prevent people with higher powers (if that is even how you do this) from just going into ANY channel within the scope they would have?
I am looking for the concept of isolation for different server groups basically so they cannot interact if so desired.
Thanks
Had you used the Search Function you'd have known it has been asked many times before and is not possible. That's what Channelgroups are for.
Thanks. I did google with zero success so I came right here to make a post.

Hi all!
First, sorry for my bad english!
I bought a NAS a few days ago 'cause I want my pictures in safety place. I have a pc and a NAS at home and a notebook in my work. I have created a new catalog, called "master", and I imported the pictures to my NAS/Lightroom folder. I worked on some pictures then I copied my catalog file and the master Previews.lrdata folder to my NAS, 'cause I would like to working on the photos at my notebook in work. So today, I have copied my catalog file and the master Previews.lrdata folder to my notebook from the NAS, but when I open the catalog file lightroom say: "The folder could not be found." I have got the pictures (NEF) on my notebook, too, but I don't know where can I put them to LR see them.
So how can I working on the same photos on two different pc (at home's pc and my notebook in work)?
Thanks a lot for your helps and sorry again for my bad english!
Have a nice day to all!
I put my photos and Library/Previews on an external USB drive so I don’t need to copy anything, anywhere, to work on the photos on two different computers. I backup the catalog and photos to another drive overnight so if I drop the external drive I have everything. To make this painless, I assigned the same drive letter to the USB drive on both the laptop and desktop.
Thanks for your quickly answer!
That is an option too, what you do, but if you drop your external drive, your photos will be lost or not?!? I haven't got a lot of storage so this is why I keep my photos on my NAS (4 terrabytes in raid5). I don't want to buy a big capacity external drive too for my photos...
I found a root-pixels.db and a previews.db files in the master Previews.lrdata folder. Can I overwrite the localization folder in this files??? Maybe if I make another way for the LR to fiend my photos on my notebook, it will works....or not?
Hi zsenillio,
Ssprengel has his photos not only on the external USB-drive, but as well copied over somewhere else for safety..
If you want to do all sorts of work on either PC/Notebook without planning ahead, i.e. Including Develop, then both machines need access to the same photos and catalog file, hence the advice to have everything on an external USB drive. Which needs to be large, obviously.
I have never read about editing interference in single files of the previews folder. But you would have to do this back and forth with every switch of working machine?
I would advise a different workflow, which needs more planning, if you do not want another terabyte-USB-drive as transportation vehicle between the two machines:
On your master-PC think of "checking out" a portion of images to work on on the laptop: export them as catalog, name this portion accordingly. You can include the photos themselves and the previews.
If your laptop should be capable to connect to your NAS, export them there, and import this check-out-catalog into your separate 2nd catalog on your laptop (which should be named differently feom the master, auxiliary-catalog or second-view).
Do your work on the laptop.
While you do, this bundle should be taboo on your PC. Unfortunately, as LR does not know such a checkout-concept by itself, dedicate some otherwide unused labeling feature, e.g. a colour, to mark the photos which have been included in the checkout catalog.
When you are ready on your laptop, export the photos again as catalog from there, which is now a "to-get-checked-in catalog", again just an intermediate transportation vehicle. Maybe you assign another check-in colour in case you would want virtual copies.
Import this into your master catalog on the PC, remove the check-out/in label colours.
Delete both intermediate transportation catalogs from everywhere.
So you see how easy this is to trap yourself, in case you deviate from strict discipline?
Is a terabyte-usb-drive really too expensive instead? It should be usb3.0, as it may be too slow in writing speed for a catalog otherwise.
Cornelia
Hi Cornelia!
Thanks for your help, too!
At now I try another way and it looks working, but I'll know only if I arrive to home...so I downloaded the visual subst program to my notebook and I made a same named virtual drive like my NAS at my home...LR has found all my photos, so I make some differents on some of these photos and when I arrive to home, I'll copy my catalog file and Previews.Irdata folder to my desktop and I'll see that works or not!
Thanks again for your answers, you are greats!
p.s.: I'll post my result afternoon!
My suggestion would be to use your NAS as the backup location, and use a 1TB USB3 WD Passport or similar to host your catalog and photos. I use PTReplicator overnight to copy my photos to my backup location every night. Other people use things like RoboCopy.
The issue you’ll have with what you’re doing is what happens when you run out of space for photos and catalogs. My 1TB drive holds about 1 years worth of photos, and I export a copy of my older photos, a month or a quarter at a time, to another catalog file my archive storage (not the same location as my backup copy of current work) and move the photos, themselves over there, and then remove the LR catalog reference to the photos. My archive storage is a collection of 2TB drives I put into a drive dock, so I can swap between the various hard-drives when I need to look for something.
Thanks a lot! I didn't found how can I set the location for the backup to my NAS...but what I did yesterday, it works...The copy's time will be very long when my catalog file will be bigger, so I have to do that what you wrote...I'll buy that 1TB WD Passport.
Thanks again for all, you helped me a lot! See you later, have a nice day for everybody!

Many users of the CS6 softwares complain about issues since their upgrade to CS6 with MAc OsX Lion 10.7.4 . For my part, I lost the use of my internal speaker and all videos in YouTube are soundless and freeze at 12 seconds. iTunes doesn't playback my mp3 but in Premiere, I 've got sound. I can't even adjust the volume of my speakers.
I have been running Lion (currently 10.7.4) for many months on an iMac and a MacBook Pro. In fact, Lion is about to be upgraded to Mountain Lion.
I have had no attributable problems when heavily running InDesign CS6, Illustrator CS6, Photoshop CS6 and other CS6 applications occasionallly.
Loss of internal speakers and ability to play YouTube videos may be Lion issues for you but it has nothing to do with Adobe. You might ask about those issues on the Apple Community Forums, or by visiting the Genius Bar at an Apple store.
I say so because it's when I installed my CS6 softwares that the problems occured.
I confirm that my problems where because of the CS6 softwares. I restored my system with time machine and voilà! Internal speakers are ok, iTunes is ok, streaming videos are ok!
OK, Adobe helped me and all you need to do is correctly uninstall older softwares prior to installing new ones. Here's the step by step: -problems.html

Hi,
I have a video player that I'm creating in Flash -- my video clips are on different scenes and I wanted a "menu" bar to allow the viewer to pick which scene they wanted. I found tutorials for various scrolling thumbnail menu bars and I eventually found a code which allowed me to click from scene to scene.
However, now that the menu bar works, the video clips do not automatically play anymore and I'm not sure why.
This is the link to my file:
I only have one action script on the scene, which is the top layer that has [AS]stop();[/AS]
I have two buttons on either side of the video clip:
[AS]on (press) {
nextScene(); play();
}[/AS]
[AS]
on (press) {
gotoAndPlay("SI", 1);
}
[/AS]
This is the coding for the scrolling menu bar:
Frame 1:
[AS]// Photoscroller 2.0
// Original Author: Barry Driessen
// Upgraded by: Rob Gungor
// I don't care if u use this thingy, you don't have to
// give me credit for it. Just knock yourself out with it!!
//
// If you like it or have suggestions, just drop me an e-mail!
//
// **stupid people tip**
// to use this scroller as is --
//copy all the frames in the timeline (by right/(control //for mac) click, copy frames)
//then right click on your timeline and paste frames
//
//sorry if that is insulting, but when I first started this stuff, I was dumb too :-)
//
// Okay... First let's set some variables......
//
// Xphoto = startposition of the scoll image
xphoto = 258;
//
// Widthmovie = This variable hase to be set to the
// same amount of the moviewidth
widthmovie = 325;
//
// Scrollspeed = The scollspeed of the image (high numbers result in slow scrolls 10=average)
scrollspeed = 25;
//
// widthphoto = the width of your scrollable image in pixels
widthphoto = 2116;[/AS]
Frame 2:
[AS]// Setting the xmouse to 0 in the centre of the movie:
xmouse = _xmouse - (widthmovie / 2);
// Setting the speed:
speed = (xmouse) / scrollspeed;
// If the speed is negative, the speed will be made positive here:
if (speed < 0) {
speed = -(speed);
}
//new function courtesy of Rob
//basically says that if the mouse isn't betwen these two y points it won't work
//**stupid people tip**
//make sure that you figure out the top and bottom y points of your "photo" and insert them accordingly!
mouseposition = getProperty("/myself", _y);
if (_ymouse < 330) {
speed=0;
}
if (_ymouse > 390) {
speed=0;
}
// If the mouse moves to left, the photo will scroll to the right:
// (That makes sense.... Doesn't it!! ;-)
if (xmouse < 258) {
xphoto = xphoto + speed;
}
// If the mouse moves to the right, the photo will scroll to the left:
if (xmouse > 258) {
xphoto = xphoto - speed;
}
// Checking for the left end of the image:
if (xphoto > 258) {
xphoto = 258;
}
// Checking for the right end of the image:
if (xphoto < -(widthphoto - widthmovie)) {
xphoto = -(widthphoto - widthmovie);
}
// Placing the moviclip (photo) on it's new postition:
setProperty("photo", _x, xphoto);
[/AS]
[AS]gotoAndPlay (2)
// make sure this clip this in your movie when you copy it.
//
//**last stupid people tip**
// if you copy these frames into any other frames other than 1, make sure you change the frame that it repeats (ie. if you copy these 3 action frames into 5,6,7 "gotoAndPlay (6)")--
///ok duh-i know. :-)
//
//
// The mouseovers are quite simple. Just open the Movieclip "MouseOver"
// to see how it works...
//
//
// Have fun!!!!!
//**i realized that it's more fun when drinking beer.
//-rg
[/AS]
Then inside the thumbnail, to make it serve as a button:
[AS]on (rollOver) {
button2.gotoAndPlay(2);
}
on (rollOut) {
button2.gotoAndPlay(16);
}
on (release) {
// You can assign an actionscript to each Button in here:
_level0.gotoAndPlay("my_target1");
}[/AS]
Thanks!
you have a lot of coding problems.
do any of your goto's work correctly?
All of my go-to's work perfectly! They all go the scene that they're suppose to. It's just that the movie clips no longer play when I go to the scene.
what are you calling video clips? flv's that are played in flvplayback components?
You are correct.
have your enabled the autoPlay property of your components?
Where do I check to make sure it is enabled?
go to the keyframe where you have one of your non-playing flvplayback instances, click to select the component and in the components parameter panel there is a checkbox for autoPlay. check it and retest.
When I try to look at it with the component selector, it's not selecting the file and gives me the generic "Select a component instance..." message
It might be because I'm not using a "flash player" component-- I just have the video clip/.flv on the stage.
then don't use nextScene() or prevScene. use gotoAndPlay().
That's not the problem-- even if I push "testmovie" or "testscene" without using the controls, the movie doesn't play. However, if I delete my thumbnails menu, it plays perfectly fine.
you need to remove:
gotoAndPlay (2)
so your video can play. you've embedded your flv into your timeline so it only plays when the timeline plays and that goto is preventing the timeline from playing.
of course, if you remove that the thumbnail code won't work.
bottomline: your project code is a mess and using an flv in a timeline is not what you should be doing.
you should have no code attached to objects, no frame loops and no flvs embedded in a timeline. you should attach your code to a timeline, user an enterframe loop and use an flvplayback component to play your flv(s).

Hi. Good work.
About the anatomy, in the 3rd image counting from the left, I find that there's a weird lump in the belly, looks weird from the sides. I think it should be flattened up. The arm pits-breast is too much hard-edged imho. The ears seem a tad small to me as well. The belly"hole" i think it is too rectangular, and lastly, the breasts seem a bithard edges as well.
Of course it could be of your reference tough, but without knowing her we can't say much.
These shouldnt be too hard to fix:thumbsup: . Looks great!

I agree with those that disliked the characters ... but I dislike the characters in every FF game. Actually, as far as FFVIII goes, the characters rank pretty highly on my list. At least Rinoa had the balls to chew out (the Mary Sue) Squall when he was being a douchebag. Well, once. She didn't do it the other fifty times.
--*--Bring Back MI:13
We need more Black Knight and Faiza Hussain!
The rest of the time she acted like a capricious little child. And everyone had to go after her
..
I tried to play the game three times, but the three times I couldn't continue because of a bug. I tried other CD (starting a new game), and I did not have that bug ... but another one later.
How come no one is coming in here to Defend Lair? LAIR, people!!!
I only know that it's pretty much the worst game that's been made for the PS3, so I expected to come in here and everyone defending it :)
As for me, I really love Web of Shadows. I do not know how much people hated it, but I think it's the best HD version of Spider-Man 2 that is available. There was a lot of innovation in the game. I haven't played a lot of the other Spidey games, but I'm pretty sure the aerial web attacks was new, the chaining of hits was new and fun, the wall attacks, the parkour-like elements, wall slide and running, etc.
The problems I had with the game is the voice acting and it's kind of glitch-y.

Shout out to Kev Walker! You're doing a hell of a job!
Find & follow me on Twitter & Instagram. Check out arfguy
Behaviour-wise, Rinoa was hardly the worst of the bunch either. Every single hero is a complete douchebag for one thing. I don't want this thread to be hijacked by Final Fantasy talk though, so I'll leave it at that.

Yuna was whinny and clingy but got redemption through X-2 where she was a diva with kick ass short shorts and guns
Celes was overall very whinny but we had Terra to fix things when she was being emo
we always have a 2nd girl that picks up where the other falls short, but for Rinoa... its kinda pointless she's alone, Quistis I don't know why she gets so much love when she barely has any lines throughout the whole story, I guess its the whole hot for teacher complex? And Selphie 0___o she's more of a dude than a chick she was a "female" version of Michelangelo from TMNT!!
Depending on who you talk to, Legend of Dragoon was horrible. But I loved it. Thought the cutscenes were great, enjoyed the timed attacks in battles, thought the dragoon magic was cool, and thought the game looked great. It's up on PSN now, so I'm not sure how well it holds up. Will have to go back and see.
There may be a little difference between them, but they all rubbed me the same way.
One thing that the developers recognized after 8 was that a gigantic realistic character running around an overhead map was very disturbing to the human eye/mind. In 7 it worked because Cloud was cartoony looking but in 8 it would slap you in the face everytime you moved around the world map, thus why from then on your characters were either cartoony on the world map or the realistic character did not move around on a world map.

We use Bento 4 professionally in our studio with 5 users and it is fantastic but we really need this and a couple other features that would make the iPad App and the desktop version a more complete solution.
FEATURE REQUEST:
1. Need the ability to work with a shared database running on a computer in our studio, on the iPad version when connected via wifi.
2. Would like to have the ability to have single relational fields.
3. Way to switch off all the UI with related data fields and simple list when we print so all we get is the header, contents and summery.
Please advise,
Dave
Answer
TeamSDA:
Thank you for your post.
Currently, Bento for iPad/iPhone can only sync to Bento for Mac; not share. I have forwarded this suggestion to our Development and Product Management departments so they can consider this in a future release.
Your request for a single relational field was previously submitted on January 7, 2010 via your post at, and the request is still marked as active.
Could you expand a bit on request #3? Specifically, what did you want to see in the header? The field names? Did you want a table grid? Maybe if you provide an example or picture, it will make the request clearer. I just want to make sure I forward the correct information to the appropriate people.

Redbox Sued Over Multi-Day Rental Fees
Sorry if this is the wrong area, I didn't know where else to put it.Check out my HDD reviews or learn more about me here.
Me on IMDb.com.
Ebates -- Where it pays to shop online!
Wonder why the plantiff ignored this:
implied contract
Definition
Legally enforceable agreement that arises from the conduct, assumed intentions, some relationship among the immediate parties, or due to the application of the legal principle of equity. For example, a contract is implied when a party knowingly accepts a benefit from another party in circumstances where the benefit cannot be considered a gift. Therefore, the party accepting the benefit is under a legal obligation to give fair value for the benefit received. Opposite of express contract. See also implied in fact contract and implied in law contract.
Another one of those lawsuits that without interpreting the legal wordings of a contract is just common sense.
What is so hard to understand in "$1 a night" and you must return the DVD before 9:00 pm?
$1/per night X 25 nights after 9 pm = $25
I think that the plaintiff is the scammer. She intentionally did not return the DVDs numerous times, which is her own fault, so she can exploit the wordings in the Redbox contract.
once again, the "sue happy" citizens of the world unite! having used redbox a total of...ummmmmm, twice, i had no problem understanding the deal. it's funny that the $25 "super fee" is referenced when that cutoff is just as helpful to the consumer. think about it. if they didn't cut off at $25, you could be charged a buck a day for god knows how long! i remember when i worked at the video store...remember those?...and a lost tape, that's right, would cost you $40!
plus, the redbox email receipts/reminders/etc are constants in my inbox. forgetting is not an option...no matter how much you want to.

people are idiots. Just return the movie on time! These are the same assholes that talk in movie theaters and text. People wanting something for nothing.Epson 1080UB, PS3 and 161" Draper Screen...pure theater bliss!
movie list:
But, Redbox is stupid to use the phrase "Never a late fee" - they already got one rental chain for that; I forget if it was Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. They weren't charging a late fee, but of course if you never bothered to return the disc they charged you a fee for it, and courts interpreted that as a "late fee" - and I notice this plaintiff conveniently got charged the Redbox $25 fee a couple of times for not returning a disc. The plaintiff and her attorney(s) will get something out of this one. Charging for another rental period if you don't return the disc by 9:00 PM is still a penalty for returning late, i.e. a late fee - no matter how easily understood "$1 a night" is.

Wouldn't you love to know who is actually behind the initiation of this lawsuit?

Sony 1080p LED/LCD + Yamaha RX-V3900 + M&K Speakers & Subs
evergreen contract
Definition
Agreement between two parties that is automatically renewed (rolled over) after each completion- or maturity period, until canceled by the either party.
I think Redbox will be fine on this one. They have published literature exaplaining how Redbox works and what no late fees mean. The basically describe that you pay $1 per day, with no fees above that $1. So it is 1+1=2 for two days, not 1+1+$.50= $2.50 for two days.
The plantiff was never charged a late fee. They were charged for a rental extension. Two different things...
When we start talking 'legalese', I could see RedBox taking a big hit for this. You're right: rather imbecilic to use "Never a late fee" as a slogan. I mean, was "$1 a day" not clear-cut enough? The "Never a late fee" slogan is almost a deliberate attempt to mislead, or make people subconsciously overlook the fact that if they don't return it in 1 day, they are going to be paying $2 (and so on). --Regardless of how many 'email reminders', etc. they are sent. Sure, you'd have to be a monkey to really be that naive to think that it's "$1 for a day", and if you happen to return it 40 days later, you owe nothing else because you already paid your $1. But, nothing says that it couldn't be interpreted in that fashion (albeit by the mind of a complete imbecile.)
Hotels charge a rate "per night". And, if you extend your stay one night, you can be pretty certain that they are going to bill you for 2 nights when you check out. But, they don't go through a silly scheme to say, "Never a late fee at our hotel!"
The plaintiff is obviously a big-time scammer. But, RedBox has foolishly left themselves wide-open to it. And, at the end of the day, if a cut-rate business that puts human beings out of work (albeit at relatively low-paying jobs), and removes the ability of others to enjoy perusing a wide physical selection of videos in a store .....if that type of business becomes unsolvent and has to go belly-up due to this lawsuit (and their own stupidity) .... I won't lose sleep over it.A)
An extra $1 is fair if you keep it past 24 hours. They simply need to make that clearer on the kiosk.
As for the $25 failure to return fee. It is not excessive. Those machines are frequently stocked with current hot movie titles. Titles not present in the machine for renting cost them money. Rental stores have charged far more for the replacement cost than that for years. Anyone that thinks they can keep the movie indefinitely without some kind of penalty are just plain nuts.
I hope Red Box prevails in both cases. They are offering a better service for less and often in under served areas that are too small for a full rental store.
If you go into the way back machine. Video stores used to charge (and some still do) a different rate for a late fee, or slap on a fixed charge. For example, a locally run video store in my town charged $3 for two days to rent VHS, but you could only keep it for two days, or you were late. If you returned it on day 3 or day 4, you paid another $3 plus a $2 fixed late fee. Day 5 or 6, $6 + $2 late fee.
Another example is Blockbuster. At one point they charged $5 for 2 days. After two days, you had a 7 day grace period of no late fees. After 7 days, a late fee of $1.31 for each two days was applied.
Or another example, my local library is free for 7 days. After 7 days, you pay a late fee of $1 per day.
Why are people so down on Kiosks? Sure, they may put a few minimum wage clerks and a mid-wage manager out of work. But making and maintaining the Kiosks employees skilled workers at better than minimum wage jobs.
Further, a Kiosk that only uses 13 sq ft can supply 1700 discs (this model is used in Europe)! The same company has a design for a 5426 disc version that only takes up 30 sq ft. A typical Blockbuster is 4800 sq ft and houses around 5000-6000 movies and games. Even a small video store is 1800 sq ft. But you can replace a 4800 sq ft building (with a 12,000 sq ft parking lot) with only 30 sq ft of efficiently used space!
Plant some trees and make a play park for the kids with the space you save. Hey, thats more jobs making and maintaining the park!
Then on top of that, a Kiosk doesn't require extra heating and cooling. It doesn't run 200 15W lights for 16 hours a day. It doesn't need water and sewer. Doesn't need as much energy in the initial construction. It is incredibly green compared to traditional stores. It's obvious that movie stores are a tremendous waste of space and energy. Kiosks are as efficient as you can.

The three young DL seem like good bets to different degrees.
DeMario Davis should do just fine at LB.
Holmes could have a quality season if there's a QB, but that wouldn't be a breakout. The two main CBs are capable of monster INT seasons.
Vlad Ducasse? Joe McKnight? Clyde Gates? Stephen Hill? Blah Blanchez? Kyle Wilson? Blah Blahbow? Blah Blahelroy?
The safest bets are all on defense with the DL guys leading the way.

Combining the best in new technology with the greatest compatibility
23 July 2012, Taipei, Taiwan – Elitegroup Computer Systems (ECS) has announced a new series of motherboards - B75 Series. These three new PC motherboards based around Intel's B75 Express chipset support for the latest CPU technology: Intel Small Business advantage, as well as compatibility with older products and a future upgrade path. They offer an impressive range of features for home and business use, including SATA 3.0 hard drive connection at up to 6Gb/s, USB 3.0 for high speed external data transfer, plus PCI Express 3.0 and DirectX 11 for advanced graphics.
There are three motherboards in the ECS B75 series: the B75H2-D, the B75H2-M2, and the B75H2-M3. The B75H2-M2 and the B75H2-M3 are compact 244mm x 200mm Micro ATX format boards, while the B75H2-D is a DTX format board.
Small business advantage
All three boards come with the Intel Small Business Advantage (SBA) security and productivity software, a set of tools designed to help small businesses manage their PC infrastructure to enhance productivity, protect valuable data, and cut operating costs.
SBA includes security features like Software Monitor, to monitor critical security software and alert users if it is compromised; Data Backup and Restore, which can start up the PC automatically outside working hours to save power costs and avoid interrupting users; and USB Blocker to protect the PC and network from viruses, malware and spyware infections carried by USB devices. SBA Productivity features include PC Health Center, which can wake up the PC to carry out maintenance and system checks; Energy Saver, to shut down PCs after working hours, and start them up automatically each morning rather than leaving them switched on all the time; the DTX-format B75H2-D motherboard features Intel vPro technology to enable the best solutions for businesses in a managed PC environment.
Unprecedented compatibility and solid power
The ECS B75 series motherboards provide full support for Intel's next-generation Ivy Bridge CPUs for cutting edge performance, but they still maintain compatibility with Sandy Bridge and older socket 1155 CPUs to offer an easy upgrade path. The boards' LGA1155 socket accepts new 2nd and 3rd Generation Intel Core i7/i5/i3/Pentium/Celeron Processors. CPUs up to 95 Watts are supported on the B75H2-M3.
The new Intel B75 Express chipset at the heart of these motherboards offers integrated USB 3.0 support without external chips, bringing greater performance, expandability, and reliability. And these boards have official support for PCI Express Generation 3.0 add on card technology, to get the most out of future generations of graphics cards as well as today's most powerful models.
Expandable and connectable
All of the B75 series boards provide a wide range of expansion and upgrade options. As well as the PCI Express 3.0 x16 slot for graphics cards, each board includes at least 1 PCI Express 2.0 slot, and the B75H2-M3 even adds 2 standard PCI slots to support older add on cards.
There's huge capacity for ultra high speed storage with the latest Serial ATA (SATA 3) 6.0Gb/s devices. Connectivity includes 4 USB 3.0 ports, 6 USB 2.0 Ports and Gigabit LAN.
Integrated video output is handled by a VGA and HDMI or DVI sockets, and there's also 6 channel surround sound HD audio.
For users who need to bring older applications and processes up-to-date, these also boards offer great legacy hardware and software support with features like a COM/Serial port header and line printer port (LPT) header (not available in B75H2-M2).
Advanced user features
For hardware performance enthusiasts, these new boards provide plenty of control to get the maximum performance out of the PC, as well as the ECS M.I.B. III software for easy and convenient overclocking. The software provides an advanced range of frequency tuning features for system performance and superior gaming capability.
Lifetime reliability
To ensure lifetime reliability and customer satisfaction ECS applies stringent quality control procedures to all its products. Solid long-life capacitors in the critical CPU area guard against failure, even in the most challenging conditions. ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection protects against component damage from static electricity in dry climates, to enhance durability and lifespan. All three ECS B75 motherboards are available now

One works as recovery, I think - the other one I have no idea about; some random software (bloatware) and a Showroom folder, whatever that is. I'm going to install Windows 7, so I don't want anything that has an XP preload like the one that shipped with my laptop, but I still want to retain Lenovo's recovery features without limiting my options. I don't want any bloatware partitions, though. I'm not exactly clear on exactly what they do. Are any of them worth keeping?
05-15-2009 06:52 AM
Hi,
I recommend to create recovery media. So you have a CD/DVD set available once you want to go back to your initial preload.
you'll find it in START - Programs - ThinkVantage.
The first medium is the Boot CD (you should use a CD as a DVD is wasted free space) the next media (number depending on imagesize - normally one) should be DVDs (not sure whether Blueray would work - I have none)
If you have installed Rescue and Recovery, you can use that tool to make a snapshot of your system as is (instead of the preload as it was shipped)
You will not be able to create the recovery media once you killed the partitions.
Maybe it's also a good Idea to copy the contents of the C:\SWTools folder as it holds all drivers (maybe outdated but still better than nothing) and the OS Fixes AND APPLICATIONS like WinDVD and the Sonic burning tools.

I set an IP, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers on one of my profiles.
But after each reboot OS (and a hibernate), only default gateway does not applies (I can see it by "ipconfog").
So I must each time (after reboot/hibernate) disconnect this profile and connect again.
And it's OK - gateway applies.
Why is this happening? Some time ago (three months ago may be) it works correctly... This in trouble after changing an IP on that profile.
P.S. I have an updated Vista SP2 and Thinkvantage Access Connections v.5.50 Build 6ICV16WW.
03-19-2010 02:49 AM
No any assumption or may be question?
I have good news and bad news:
1. After some times rebooting Access Connections can store 'default gateway' after hibernate.
2. But it still missed after each reboot.
Can anybody help me?
04-22-2010 03:01 PM
Hi,
did you tried to update to the lates t5.6x version of Access Connection?
If yes, then pleas ealso update following:
Power Manager
Power Management driver
System interface driver
Hotkey utility
Wifi driver
Let me know, if this worked for you, as I'm interrested if you still see the same with the latest build.
Cheers
05-17-2010 06:07 AM
I have the latest version of all of these products (all updates with System update are installed) and my problem didn't solved.
It stays for a profile with static IP, when I reboot my OS. (For dynamic IP it works correctly)
Filled fields :
- IP address
- Subnet mask
- Default gateway
2 DNS servers (may be they are not accessible)
- "Use following advanced DNS settings"
- "Append these DNS suffixies" (1 record)
- Connection specific DNS suffix
- Register this connection's addresses in DNS
- Use this connection's DNS suffix in DNS registration
and
- Do not use proxy
05-18-2010 01:31 AM
After reboot i can see correct
IP
Subnetmask
DNS-suffix
by the function IPCONFIG.
But if I'll open network connection properties, there will be filled not correct static IP 0.0.0.0 and 255.0.0.0 subnet mask.
If I'll open "advanced" properties, there will be 2 IP: 0.0.0.0 and the correct.
And no one Gateway.
06-08-2010 02:38 AM
I have last version AC now (5.62).
Problem stays.
I want to add some information:
Network connection properties contains wrong IP adress even it works perfectly after applying profile. There wrong IP 0.0.0.0 and real IP 172.17.1.91 in the properties.
I can delete wrong IP from there, but it stays after reboot (and the gateway too).
No any ideas?
It's really problem with a static profiles.

- Code: Select all
sudo passwd -dl root
To the main question how to I enable direct access to the account. I will probable keep it locked for now be i just need to know how to enable just In case i ever have to have use it any ideas
But why in the world is it enabled in the first place. Most people use there computer for simple tasks(such as internet browsers, listening to music, playing games) Which requires the root account in no way at all(Just use Sudo right?)leaving it unlocked just for the sake of it is a very good way to get the system totally distorted! You got root you got the system! Okay so important data you can just encrypt sure but what about the rest of the system files the boot and other important things with root as long as its not in use you can just delete it! What user would do that more like what application would do that! Running a cleanup in root not a good idea but what if the user forgets! Make users go through the process of enabling it rather than disabling it! I heard about a guy that unsecured his Wifi (Idk why maybe for a test?) and of coarse all his " Neighbors" connected to it like mad. So he changed the name to something like "please do not connect" and of course those people just had to see that Facebook sh#t. So he changed it again to something like "Seriously do not connect to my wifi" and yeah that twitter just had to be read so it was like Christmas time in Kmart on that poor router...... The man decide to change it one more time "DO NOT CONNNECT!!!!!!" (Okay i do not think that was the name but you get it
I am not saying get rid of the user account root (please do not) I am just saying to have it locked and make the user put in a terminal command to lock it and unlock as needed but keep it locked as default seems like a better idea to me. It can always be enabled by a simple little command! Some users might just run root account because of all the freedom it brings but a least making them look up the code will make them see the risks.
This is a nice topic discussing it
Also in the terminal when the font turns red its root right. Mine turned red from running su - root. It sure was intimidating that red font! I quickly closed it because I thought I was root and did not want to break my system!

To make a lon story short my LO is almost five weeks old. She has been a great eater since day one. Last week I got what I thought was a clogged duct, called ot be sure and the nurse agreed so I left it over the weekend. By Monday morning I knew it was mastitis because I was in so much pain and called again, they gave me a prescription over the phone took that until Yesterday morning when I went back in because the pain was sooooo bad! They gave me a stronger antibiotic and some percocet, thank heavens
I'm going back in tomorrow for a follow up because things are not getting better, I can't feel it any more but its still there!I'm going back in tomorrow for a follow up because things are not getting better, I can't feel it any more but its still there!
Here's my new problem though. My nipple is literally disappearing now! its just becoming smaller and smaller sinking into my areola. This morning when I was feeding the LO and took her off (I am currently using a shield to nurse) I noticed that all of a sudden a blister had appeared right up next to my nipple, but not the normal kind. It was big like a second nipple and after about 30 minutes went away.
Has anyone had either of these things happen to them? I really would rather not have one very protruding nipple and one inverted for the rest of my life lol
Oh and I am pumping and feeding trying to keep the breast as soft as possible besides the obvious mastitis lump so its not like my nipple is getting stretched out I don't think. Please help me!

The iMac is a consumer-level system designed to meet the needs of non-professional users. Only the top-of-the line iMac even comes close to matching the bottom rung Mac Pros in terms of processing power and the iMac is not expandable. Aside from adding memory and external peripherals, the iMac purchased today will be limited to the technologies it came with. That makes the iMac the bane of power users because it is in no way a mid-level professional system, but a mid- to high-end consumer system.
The exception are office professionals that could use an iMac because the nature of their work does not warrant the processing power of a professional system; the classification of a system as “professional” by an OEM typically means that the system is geared toward power users and not simply professionals in the business sense of the word. As such persons can continue to use a computer as is well into its obsolescence, and often have no choice but to do so until their employer decides to upgrade the systems in their office, the price of a “professional” system, is not justifiable. In fact, the business systems offered by Wintel PC OEMs typically differ little from their consumer-level offerings.

Here's the problem with your point of view. It's not a big enough market.
Yup, I just said it again.
Despite your opinion, and the opinions of the many posters you refer to, that's not what Apple is going to bring.
Maybe you noticed that Apple's Cinema Display's are horribly out of date and over priced relative to the market as well. That's been the case for how long now ? Is Apple doing anything about it ? No, because it's not a big enough market. Major manufacturers are all beating each other up competing in that segment so why should Apple bother.
Maybe you noticed that updates to computers don't happen in line with Macworld or the developers conference as they used to. Why ? Because that let the market dictate Apple sales, as it did for so many years. A slump in sales preceded the annual events as buyers held out for the latest update. Not a good business model. So now the Mac Pro and Xserve updates were unceremoniously announced a week prior to MW. MBPs will be updated in a couple of weeks, when they're ready.
Maybe you also noticed that Apple is no longer Apple computer. They're much more than that and they will continue to broaden their market, not chase the one you suggest is in need of a mid-level Mac.
You could say they, " Think different."

Hi,
I'm trying to read data from a transmitter via RS232 and DasyLab V9.00.01. The transmitter sends only HEX-values. I have got a conversion formula
to achieve the final result from this HEX-value. Therefore I'd like to work with the pure HEX-Values in DasyLab.
The HEX-String looks like this:
2C 01 81 16 F7
With the help of a format string I get the interesting HEX-values:
81 61 F7
Now I could calculate my final result, but DasyLab converts it to ASCII. So I only get:
□-÷
Which is equal to "0" as output value.
Is there any way to work with the HEX-Value alone and ignore the useless ASCII code?
Hopefully someone can help me with that.
Thanks!
06-29-2011 12:25 PM
what format string are you using?
ah?
or b, to just read the binary value of the character?
06-29-2011 03:17 PM
06-29-2011 03:24 PM
No matter which format you use, DASYLab will convert the incoming string to a floating point number.
If you use the a, then it will interpret the number literally.
If you use the ah, then it should take each character, and convert it.
so,
2C 01 81 16 F7
should be interpreted by ah as
2
12
0
1
8
1
1
6
15
7
2ah
should interpret it as
44
1
129
22
247
Once inside DASYLab, you can then operate on these numbers using the bit logic module or the formula module to do the Hex math that you need.
if you need the values all at once, then set up additional channels to read each character, so that the module will have 5 or 10 outputs. The formula works better that way.
You can visualize the interpreted data in the Digital Meter, by changing the display to Hex.
06-30-2011 04:15 AM
Thanks for your fast response!
Am I supposed to enter the format of the data at any other point than at the format string?
As I sad, my format string is:
2X 3AH.
Therefore I should already use the right format, at least I hope so. I tried also ah and 2ah as you suggested, but the interpretation (RS232 Monitor) is always:
2C 00 04 27 30 , - - ' 0
When I control the connection between the RS232 modul and my digital meter the value transferred is always "0".
Also little HEX values can't be used because they always yield a value of "-".
I'm really helpless at the moment.
06-30-2011 08:03 AM
Do you want to read the entire string as a single number?
To change the digital meter to display Hex, do this
06-30-2011 09:45 AM
Does this work?
5 channels are set to read "b" or byte
Display the value (0-255) on the list, and display the Hex value on the Digital Meter.
You should then be able to use the bit logic modules and the formula module to process your decoding.
07-04-2011 06:04 AM
That's exactly the solution I was looking for. Thanks very much for your help!

Hello everybody My first post! I haven't got round to doing an intro yet - been so busy lurking here and researching and getting tested and getting ready for tx. Anyway have some a/v and abx tx coming up (Vatrex and Doxy) - starting in couple of weeks. Got mercury out now and done two rounds of chelation. Am happy with what i'm doing with the DMSA, have read andy cutler a bit. Its the EDTA amounts i could do with help with. I am combining the two supps. I want to get as much done as possible before tx and so will only have time for 3 or 4 chelation rounds. (So 1 or 2 more). I want to get the very best out of my tx cos i am in the uk and so a/v and abx are very hard to get - so i doubt if there will be many more/if any. I am doing the DMSA (and adding in ALA later) for all the usual reasons, detox but also bio film break up if poss. The ETDA i am doing for more urgent and worrying reasons in that i have the second to worse degree of rouleau red bld cells - aggregated or protein linkage. I have high homocysteine at 23. Tortuous veins behind eyes (only place visable) and a pain in my left temple which scares me. With the rouleau and fibrin i am worried about a stroke. So i want to take as much as possible but be safe. 1st round - I took 10mg DMSA + one sixth of a cap ETDA (83mg). 2nd round was 20mg DMSA + 125mg (quarter cap) EDTA. I understand one can go up to 100mg eventually with the DMSA. BUT my question is what is the highest amount of EDTA one can take in a dose (doses every 4 hours) for the eventual amount? (amt to aim for) and how much should i take for my next dose? Although i realise i should stay on the same dose for 3 rounds i am prepared to risk a little because i will not have completed much chelation before tx starts and i dont think i will be well enough to do chelation during tx. My 3rd round will be a cautious inc to 25mg DMSA but i understand the ETDA is better tollerated so......? Sorry such a long post and hi again to all, love the forum and all the people trying to get better. wwxx (wishing well, kiss kiss)

Thanks mate...
EDIT: For those wondering, the above replay is a 4 player Axis Stonewall match, which played out normally until right at the very end, where, just when we were about to finish off the last ranger squad at the end of wave 16, I heard the sound of a V1 incoming, with my game (and that of two of my allies) crashing just before it landed. The replay for it did not show up on my temp.rec (rather, the temp file I had was still that of the game I had played prior to playing the Stonewall match in question), but it did show up on EdgeInc's who was the only player who's game didn't crash.
Naturally, I was curious as to what happened, so I directed Edge here on how to upload a replay using this forum's system. When sending me a link to the uploaded replay via PM didn't work, I told him to just make a thread about it in this section of the forum.
For those wondering, the replay shows all players bar EdgeInc suddenly crashing out and the V1 landing in what was the middle of the base, crippling EdgeInc's StuG but otherwise causing no significant damage. Edge was then able to finish off the last ranger squad and the game counted as a win despite its odd conclusion.
I don't suppose any of you know what might have happened? Note that this was not your traditional lag-out type affair. The crash of my game was sudden and unexpected...

GeoffS, the version was (as you might expect) 2.601. I say that because I'm not convinced EdgeInc's going to come back to this forum any time soon, he having only signed up to deliver this replay to me...

Hey,
I have noticed in the UK there some really stupid squad names. So as a joke I have made a video with the most cheesy music I could find and created the stupidest squad I could think of the "Hunts SC national vago squad". Me and my good friend Tim went to the vago nationals in our clubs new vagos and came 4th overall and got these clips from the second day of sailing.
Hope you enjoy, the video gets a bit more interesting towards the end, if any one wants to see a better video which isn't just a **************** take leave a comment bellow :P

We are pretty damn excited to say that work on our Artist Spotlight Site is finally done and we can now proudly show off some of the Concept Work, as well as the artists that have done it, to the world! As some of you may or may not know I've been heading up the Project Titled 'Paradise Lost' for a bit now and while it's been a struggle at times I think we've really hit our stride. So as a little way of thanking the Artists on board who make this project as visually amazing as it is we've put together a Spotlight Site where we showcase a new piece of Art every week that, due to NDA constraints, would normally be hidden away from the world. Through this site you can check out all members of our Creative Team as well as read Bio's and see last week's work. We will also be putting a new concept track from the Game soundtrack up which plays in the background. We are extremely proud of the work that is going into this Project and hope to bring as much recognition and attention to the artists who we are so grateful to be working with through this site! So without Further Ado: "Re-Education" is the piece for this week, there is of course a larger version on the main site. Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Tue Jun 10, 2008 9:37 pm Proud to present a new piece this week comically entitled 'Sleeping on the Job'. A bit graphic, although this fella's other deaths are a bit worse. The music is a little cello/violin riff we are fiddling around with that I personally like a lot. Again the link is: Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Thu Jul 03, 2008 1:10 am Micha, one of our amazing artists out of Belgium is in the Spotlight this week with his work on the Photospore.. We wanted a clean looking mounted energy weapon that could be setup quickly yet still provide some defense and pack a punch.. Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Wed Jul 09, 2008 11:56 pm I always get excited to present environmental pieces as they help portray not only the look of what we are working on but also bring across the emotions we hope to evoke during the experience. We are blessed with Paul Scott Canavan as one of our environmental artists and he did a fantastic job with this piece at narrowing in on the underlying feeling of isolation felt in one of our main areas Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 12:58 pm This week brings us another awesome character sketch by Joanna, her talent for getting the exact emotional response from her characters always impresses me. The Re-Educator is a sinister fellow of sorts who's job is to implant memories specific of what the government wants it's people to believe. The sarcophagus being one of our test designs for these memory implant pods Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Wed Jul 23, 2008 3:01 am Something perhaps a little less glamorous this week but essential non-the-less.. In order to maintain visual unity throughout our game and make it look like the entire project was conceptualized by one artist as apposed to a team of 25 located from LA all the way to Belgium we've started making a lot of items that are to be used throughout to keep things consistent. Items such as doors, cameras, lights, card readers, etc etc. So this week we have a group of lighting fixtures that we wanted to have a slightly futuristic feel to them but nothing so much over the top that it fee's star trekish and outlandishly sci-fi Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2008 12:29 am It's always fun to create stuff that can blow up the stuff that other artists are creating Or at least fill them full of holes. And that is exactly what our Concept Artist / Weapons Specialist did this week with his Energy Rifle. Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Wed Aug 13, 2008 2:07 pm Terry Maranda has blessed us with some great costume designs this week.. We are still tweaking them however we are all in love with the direction Terry is taking the children's clothing design. They will be used in one of the very sheltered colonies in our world that has been kept in the most pristine image of humanity while the rest of the race on the earth is struggling every day with life and death. A people who have maintained the luxuries of life while completely sacrificing their freedoms and individuality. Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Thu Aug 21, 2008 12:17 pm Another great piece from Timo Karhula this week, he just keeps on blowing us away with not only his amazing creativity but the quality of his presentation! The goal for this piece was to create an organic feeling building that lies in the heart of an overly high-tech society as it is meant to contrast sharply just how far they've gone to the technological side of things and how much they've sacrificed because of it Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Wed Aug 27, 2008 10:22 pm This week it is an absolute treat to bring you one of our nearly completed presentation pieces titled 'The Unexpected Hero'. Alex Gonzales, an absolutely marvelous artist has spent quite a bit of time now on this piece and after more discussions than I can count I think we are pretty much finished with it, although I know he will have a fair bit more work in his mind, in mine I just love where it is. Definitely a piece you don't want to miss so head over, check it out and let us know what you think!! Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Sun Aug 31, 2008 10:55 am We COMPLETELY revamped the site design, so as it is now 'finally finished' I wanted to show it off to you guys. The game itself is taking a much different path and we decided to hold off on the real nitty gritty earthy post-apoc part of it until the next title. So to reflect that this project will take place mainly in a cleaner, although soon to be turned into a nightmare, environment we had the new website design take on a much similar feel. There is also some slight changes to the actual spotlight image done by Alex so showing that all off too. We would all love to hear what you think Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Thu Sep 04, 2008 10:46 am Yet another unbelievable concept by our Polish Character Queen Joanna! The objective of this piece was to create a group of people living in an incredibly technological society which has become incredibly disconnected from nature. The main purpose of these people was to create them as organically, yet technologically as possible in order to contrast the harsh disconnect that the rest of their society suffers from Nature. As always Joanna nailed it! And I just wanted to share some of Joanna's attention to detail that just blew me away when I started to zoom in on the final concept here: Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Wed Sep 10, 2008 6:53 pm Roland Brown has been busy concocting some great environments for Paradise Lost and I figured it was about time that we show one, especially considering it's been months since he's been in the spotlight. For this piece we needed an apartment that was in the middle of the social pecking order.. These people aren't on the top, but not at the bottom and it was Roland's challenging job to create a mood and feel that portrayed this. Something which, as usual, he excelled at! Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Wed Sep 17, 2008 10:24 am Tyler Edlin is one of our new artists that we feel incredibly blessed to have on board our project. This week to contrast the apartment from last week we bring you one that is located in the 4th ring of the residential area, which represents a fairly significant drop in social status. Tyler is excellent at portraying this with coloring and lighting and we will probably grunge down this apartment even further when it gets taken to the level design stage. Check back in the next few months for some more amazing art work by Tyler and the rest of our Team!! Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Thu Sep 25, 2008 1:03 am We have a piece of 3D work this week, the first of many which we are extremely proud of. We have low-poly in-game model(shot on the left) and I've also included the high poly model(on the right) that we use to create our normal maps from.. Such an exciting time with normal mapping technology to be makign games.. It just makes these models look so stunningly beautiful. Raheel, one of our ever so talented Character Modellers has pumped out an awesome new NPC model this week! This dude is an interior security gaurd. We will end up giving him a semi-light weapon but wanted to keep his overall look somewhat fragile as he is going to be thrust in a scenario that he was definitely never meant to be thrust into. One of the interesting things in our first game is that it is almost completely void of A-typical hero's. None of these big bulky super-soldiers, but filled with ordinary people that are forced into extraordinary situations and becomes hero's in their own way. We are still fleshing the final bits out in our 3D conceptual stage so any crits would be much appreciated!! Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Tue Oct 07, 2008 11:51 am My humblest apologies for the lack of update last week, a daunting house move severed my connection to the online world for a week which was hell.. This week we have a piece called 'The keeper of Life' which represents the evolution of the water technicians in our culture. In a society where water is the most precious and rare commodity those charged with keeping it safe it's recycling have been placed in a revered light the same as bhuddist monks of our day. Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Wed Oct 15, 2008 10:43 am It is always a treat for our concept artists to see their creations turning into something more tangible that eventually comes to life before their eyes on the screen. Johannes Boem is giving us that pleasure this week by turning one of the lower class female children into a finished model. Well 90% finished at least, we are just putting the final touches on the skin tone, shoes and hair but everything else is ready to go and our animators are chomping at the bit to get her walking around and playing. This character is one of our background extras to fill the space and give a more human feel to our environment. Her emotional goal in the game is to make a connection with the player and make him/her more sympathetic to the plight of the underpriviledged in our game. I do want to re-iterate that besides giving props to our artists this thread is to gather critiques from you guys, so as always if you have something to say about it, something that could be changed please don't be shy, we are dying to hear from you. Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Wed Oct 29, 2008 4:33 pm My apologies about the lack of updates last week, my schedule was insane and at one point I had to put in 25 hours of straight work just to clear off my todo list that had piled up so that I could start on new jobs that needed to be done.. unfortunately the spotlight site fell on the back burner! But this we I hope to make up by giving an special treat which is one of the first studies of our mechanical enemies in the game.. These beasts were once pieces of automated mining equipment that have been retrofitted by a Rogue AI to serve a more sinister purpose. Micha did an amazing job on this guy and the version of him completely wrecked was so good I just had to make a before and after image. Enjoy Back to top umbusmemberMember #Joined: 12 Oct 2008Posts: 193Location: above? Posted: Fri Oct 31, 2008 7:34 am allowed to post in here? cool leaf costume, kind of original in a way. Back to top netflowmemberMember #Joined: 24 Mar 2008Posts: 53 Posted: Wed Nov 05, 2008 4:35 pm Of course you are allowed to post here, infact I wish more people would The leaf costume is one of my favorites.. Those characters treat nature with religious ferver and every aspect of their lives is embued with it. Another exciting day when one of our top modellers, Vicko H, turns a great character into a living breathing entity.. This fellow is an engineer mechanic that works only near the heavily radiated areas as well as other intense and hazardous environments. The colors were one thing that we had a tough time nailing down so any comments on that would be greatly appreciated Enjoy Back to top Petri.JmemberMember #Joined: 04 Dec 2003Posts: 428Location: Helsinki, Finland Posted: Thu Nov 06, 2008 6:27 am Yeah, nice work. I like the leaf idea too. But it reads Queen Joanna. In my mind, queens doesn't carry weapons, and their costumes are very aristocratic and decorated, instead of tight soldier like costumes. But that's just my impression of queen costumes. Anyway good stuff

Can't access tcrf.net
29 January 2013 - 12:52 PMRight. The title pretty much says it all.
I'm using Chrome on WinVista and whenever I type in tcrf.net in to the address bar. I can access the website through other connections but not mine.
I've cleared the history but I honestly wouldn't know the first step of what to do.
Gamesmaster Presents: Mario Vs. Sonic
25 April 2012 - 09:31 AMThe 8th issue in the Gamesmaster Presents series. Bit too expensive for my liking at £7.99 for a magazine.. You also receive some generic Classic Sonic 3 stickers of sprites and two very large double sided posters of Mario and Sonic respectively. Was very miffed at the fact that there was no article on Sonic 4: Episode 2 though.
Here's some shots of the mag in spoilers because
of image sizeeverything's in spoilers now.
Also my camerawork is awzums!

Softmodding a Saturn
30 November 2011 - 02:46 PMAbout 2 months ago as a birthday treat for myself, I bought a SEGA Saturn model 2 for the good price of £25.
Later on I got an E-mail stating that I would need to buy basically everything else for the console, I'd already bought 4 games by that point so it cost me over £60 in the end but that's off topic and a different story altogether.
ON TOPIC: I want to do the softmod treatment on my Saturn.
Looking around has suggested that the chips are no longer being made.
I'm basically asking on advice for what could/can I do now.
Anybody?
Wii RAR problems
04 March 2011 - 09:22 PMHere is my best attempt to write something whilst combatting sleep at the same time.
While I love my new homebrewed wii, I decided to make the thing play backups as I have almost everything I need finished.
I done some snooping as usual on the internets and found various sites with downloads. For testings sakes I used games I already have. (In my case which I shall explain include Tatsunoku Vs. Capcom, Warioware: Smooth Moves, Mario & Sonic at the Winter Olympics & Epic Mickey.)
My first download was off of a torrent with a complete 1 Rar of Mario & Sonic. I attempted to open the file but instead was greeted with this message "The archive is an unknown format or damaged"
I thought it could be a one off so I downloaded Warioware from a torrent but had the same message come up.
I then chose to try an alternative method of direct download from tehparadox.com. I downloaded Epic Mickey in 11 parts, opened the file and lo and behold. No luck.
I won't go into details again to save repeating myself. I used the Direct Download method for Tatsunoku Vs. Capcom with the same results.
I've figured this is closer to something I'm doing wrong myself rather than a string of bad luck.
I've searched through the web and have discovered similar results from other people but these are from 2009 with VERY VAGUE details. I've tried using Winrar 3.93 and 7-zip but no luck.
I'm coming very close to a dead end.
Ideas? Thoughts? Anything would be greatly appreciated.
EDIT: If this is either the wrong place to be posting this or shouldn't even be posting this at all just say and I'll remove this.
Problem with installing .Wad files
12 February 2011 - 05:17 PMIF this can be posted here.
Here's the thing.
I finally took the plunge and hombrewed my wii using the Jabba the Haxx exploit trick. Installed BootMii and Homebrew Channel.
I followed the step-by-step guide from this page Here
I've used WAD Manager 1.4, 1.5 & 1.7 and I always encounter the same problem with trying to install WAD's like the Sonic 4 proto.
Everytime I try to install a WAD I always get the same error message. I thought it could've been for one game so I tried Sonic 1 as well but got the same message.
I'll try my hardest to show you my problem. this is using WAD Manager 1.4
CODE[+] Available WAD files on the device:
>>Sonic_The_Hedgehog.wad (11.81MB)
[+] Press A button to (un)install a WAD file.
Press B to select a storage device
I press the A button which gives me the option to install or uninstall. Everytime attempt to install I get this page come up
CODE[+] Opening "Sonic_The_Hedgehog.wad", please wait... OK!
[+] Installing WAD, please wait...
>>>Installing ticket... ERROR! (ret = -2011)
Press any button to continue.
Sadly my feeble little mind could only think of so many failed options and now I'm in a dead end.
I'm using a 4.3E console using the Jabba the Haxx exploit which in turn is in a similar way to the Return of the Jodi exploit.
Please guys, I know at least one of you guys must know.

Yeah, I'm not touching this. No demo and no reviews, no buy. And that video above looks horrible, even more reason not to buy.
Well, this is an interesting subject:
about demo: There will be an English demo for Numen in a matter of a few weeks and it will be the same demo that was released for the Czech version. You will play as a mage in the desert (that is in the later stage of the game) and there will be lots of enemies to kill and a few quests to complete for you. If you want to give it a try, you can download the Czech demo here:
about no reviews: We naturally offered this game for a review to many gaming web sites, but with the exception of a handful of replies our offer was totally ignored. And those who replied wrote that they are not interested. It's a pity, of course, but on the other hand we can't blame them, because there are lots of games out there today and it's not possible to review them all. Nevertheless, Numen gets reviews between 6 - 7/10 on average (in Czech Republic/Slovakia/Russia and in user's reviews).
about that trailer: This is an unauthorized trailer made by our Russian publisher without us knowing about that. All we could do was to sigh and try to forget about it. Those camera angles are just horrible, not to mention music that absolutely doesn't fit to the game setting, and some parts of the trailer are from builds that were two years old back then. Of course, Numen lacks that polish you expect from AAA titles, but something like that wasn't in our power.
noodlesoup
06-30-2010, 05:22 AM
Yeah, that trailer sabotages the game more than helping it mate.
It looks like its running on about 15 fps, lacking combat animations and makes the game look pretty dull.
Need a review / demo or something, I no longer buy games on blind faith :(

Fatten or strip - the great Java debate, …
yay, more bloat
That's exaclty what Java needs. MORE bs apis. Eventually we won't have to code anything because Java will already have an api for it and any idiot will be able to code it and have no idea how to make it nice and efficient.
Hell, I once had a college professor tell me "its okay, if Java runs slow, throw more hardware behind it". How's that for the coders we have coming out of colleges these days?
Reminds me of vb. runs slow but damn is it pretty!
Please god, someone tell these ppl about c++
Sure, another language, why not?
Whenever I see someone say "we need another language" I read as "we need to squeeze more IT money in training, certification and 800-page in-a-nutshell, for-dummies or in-24-hours books and people won't fall for this with languages which already have more books about it than there are self-help books".
I am a Java fanboi. Is it really bloated? Won't the new, marvelous, light, enhanced language suffer the same destiny later? I wouldn't mind having the AWT removed (at least most of it) but it seems a case of fixing what ain't broken.
Before the flame war starts, I was a Pascal fanboi, and a (shudder) Prolog fanboi way back, before Borland stabbed our collective backs.
M'soft calling for backward compatibility???
Ha Ha Ha!!!! ROFL
But seriously, yes, RE: Rafael, I would like to see the AWT removed too but reincarnated as a plug-in library as we still have a lot of stuff out there relying on it.
No syntactic bloat, please!.
bloat shmoat.
Already bloated....
There's always some one)
Performance
The first poster's comment says more about the professor than Java. I'm a java developer in the real-world and we do care about performance here.
I like the dynamic languages like Python and Ruby too, but I don't see them being able to replace Java in the enterprise area. For one, many companies have a huge investment in Java already.
Are we talking language or library here?

Scottish news site hit by 'DDoS attack' in run-up to elections …
"unchallenged voice of Unionism"
Yeah, you never hear ANYTHING in support of Scottish independence, do you? They should set up some kind of 'Scottish National Party', and have the leader of it always be on telly, or something..
Soar Ablal!!!!
Pointless waste of time and effort if anyone really tried to "silence" newsnet. Calling it a "news" site is a bit of a stretch. All it is is a gang hut for discontented Scottish nationalists who are fed up spamming proper newspaper comments threads, and in that sense it does a good service to the nation. It was set up because the nats felt no serious paper gave them any positive coverage. However, Murdoch's Sun is now backing them, which probably makes them happy.
The top story there is a year-long whine about how somebody once said something disobliging about Scots on Radio 4's Any Questions - check it out once it's up again if you don't believe me.
Actually once it's back up again, expect the top story to be how MI5 and the BBC plotted to silence them and it's all a plot from them in London.
Anyway. let's hope it's fixed soon so the paranoid spammers have somewhere to hang out together again.
Conspiracy theorists
That site shows the twisted logic of some nationalists - I'm just waiting for the story that gravity is a LONDON PLOT to keep Scots stuck to the ground.
Are you trying to say...
"Saor Alba"?
If you must spout Gaidhlig in these pairts, do try to get it right, tapadh leibh awfully. That percussive sound you just heard was a million^H^H^H^Hhundred^H^H^H^Hdozen^H^H^H^Hcouple of teuchters facepalming.
(I agree with your post though. Apologies if the mangling was deliberate)
Slightly off topic, but...
Like many people I've just received the No2AV campaign's latest missive through my front door.
Now read this and see all the lies, half-truths and misinformation it contains:
I've seen that;
and I find it amusing that the image implies that No2AV are wrong because their leaflet uses an Ad Hominem argument, which is an Ad-Hom argument in itself...
My 2p: The campaigns for 'Yes' and 'No' are both full of crap, on the whole. Crap in politics; who'd have think it.
@fridaynightsmoke
I think you mean "Ad Hominem Tu Quoque" rather than just "Ad-Hom", however the point is that the attack on Nick Clegg at the end is just the No campaign going beyond the bottom of the barrel because they've already scraped a hole in it...
Surely another mistake
Shouldn't it be "shoo-in"? Does one "sic" cover everything? Do I hear an "ibid"?
Re: Surely another mistake
Yes it should. Frankly I couldn't be arsed/took pity on them. They were probably quite angry when they wrote it and not thinking straight.
Anyway, strictly speaking it should be 'shue-in', in reference to Elizabeth Shue's last-minute casting in Leaving Las Vegas.
Minor technical correction
> ...on Monday days before Scotland is due to vote in fiercely contested local elections.
In fact Scots are due to vote in a fiercely contested NATIONAL election on May 5th - the local elections in Scotland have been postponed to 2012. The Welsh General Election also takes place on the same day and that's pretty fiercely contested too.
Newsnet Scotland
I'd rather it was there than not.
Certainly, it's (slightly) more pro-SNP than neutral, but it's /still/ more objective than the venting of the disgruntled Yorkshiremen Eddie Barnes and David Maddox in The Scotsman -- a paper now vying with the Daily Record for Labour Rag of Year; a feat that takes some doing.
In the absence of any truly objective reporting, all you can do is read them all - NewsNet included - and make up your own mind.
AV isn't PR
"country adopts proportional representation (specifically alternative vote) "
hmm. I can't seem to select the FAIL icon.
Soar Ablal!!!! Anonymous Coward are you Iain Gray/Ed Millibrother/Fifi/Grahamski/Gardham
One by one your support will be no more and the real news will get out.
Psephology Fail
AV is NOT proportional representation. In fact it can be even less proportional than first past the post.
Fail
The correct name for the GB electroal system is plurality not FPTP, since there is no post in plurality (but there is in AV). If you want a shorthand form, why not 'MVW'; most votes wins.
AV is the wrong answer to the wrong question. Modernising electoral systems is about more than changing how you elect your Isle of Wight sized area's representative. Weirdly, since Scotland spent a couple of years agreeing what it would use in 1999, there has been not a peep out of anyone that the system should be changed. We've had 2 coalitions and a minority, and its all gone pretty well.
Denmark
While any kind of DDoS attack, or any other malicious interference with the Internet is a serious crime, I am puzzled that Scottish nationals, commenting on Scottish politics, are doing so on a server hosted in Denmark.
This raises suspicions that they are attempting to violate Scottish laws, such as limits on spending during elections - particularly as the article noted that they did this on legal advice, not because the Danish hosting company was cheaper.
Rubbish
No DDOS involved according to the hosting company - yet the hosting companies comment was quickly deleted and the story still stands - most likely because it was their own fault? :D
Piffling trouble up North...
Loving your first two posters comments. It's easy to post that Newsnet Scotland is just a gang hut for paranoid Independistas railing against the Union. Sums it all up into a neat little ball to dismiss as unimportant. It is also woefully ignorant of the what passes for the Media in Scotland.
We have no independent media in Scotland other than the couthy union busting Sunday Post and the Press and Journal. Our print media is owned and operated by Trinity Mirror, Johnstone Press, Newsquest and News International. Our state broadcaster by very dint of its being is dedicated to preserving the Union.
Since the SNP won the 2007 election they have been subjected to an hour-by-hour blast of relentless negativity from the media and the what passes for an opposition.
Rather than take my word for it, simply do a google search on the words 'SNP' 'accused' and then try to form your own opinion, rather than opt for the clichéd response of the first two posters.
The truth will out
At least you don't think that "The Sun" is a newspaper then, or is their support for the SNP supposed to be unionist irony?
You can do a google search on "anything and accused" or "anything and conspiracy" and get the same sort of results. Only a complete idiot thinks that googling is the same as researching.
The Shetland Times is not owned by any of the above media organisations either!
@Saor Abla [sic] and others
Press coverage in Scotland
Daily Record - Labour supporting
Herald - Labour Supporting/Unionist
Scotsman - Unionist
BBC in Scotland. Politics reporter who is an exLabour Councillor
Political Editors whose living used to be coaching Labour Politicians for media
Newspapers are all very well, they are private entities.
The BBC is another matter.
we pay for it, but it is guilty of very biased coverage, with very few exceptions. Sally Magnusson, when the SNP got elected, her first question to Alex Salmond was "What do you say now to the frightened people of Scotland"
Labour apparatchiks tend to get soft questions and no interruptions, the other three parties tend to get hammering and not allowed to finish their questions.
News stories showing the Labour group leader in Holyrood (he is not the Scottish Labour Leader, that position does not exist, Labour is purely a London party) in a bad light often do not make the news (Insulting the Monenegrins, accusing them of genocide and war crimes) or are slanted (running away from 9 protestors that the Annabel Goldie, when she encountered them, talked to and left on a handshake) to make him look better than he is
A common tactic is to show Iain Gray asking a question in FMQs, but not to show the answer, which often blew away the ridiculous "point"
When the Labour leader of Glasgow City Council left in very odd circumstances, the BBC had a journalist (once a spin doctor for Labour) on to assure us nothing was wrong and that was the line they carried.
When Iain Gray accused the SNP of wasting money on a rebranding on a Scottish inward investment body, the BBC political editor said he had seen the papers. It turned out not to be true, and we have yet to hear the BBC's man explain himself.
Given this, and given the indifference of the UK national newspapers to what is going on up here, this is why Newsnet exists. In has carried articles from Greens, Communists and others and would even, I'm pretty sure, carry articles from the Labour POV on the election as it has today with Colin Fox of the SSP, as long as any assertions were backed up with real numbers, something Labour have been a bit bad on this election
Danger, Will Robinson!
Troll alert! Looks like someones escaped from their padded cell on the Scotsman's comment section!
Freedom of Speech
Also I don't understand why, in an article citing Freedom of Speech so much, why they're deleting all the comments that say it was NOT a DDoS attack and that it was their own mistake.
Way to go, they've basically lost any form of credibility they may (or may not) have had.
Are you being ironic?
DDoS attacks are all about the signal-to-noise ratio (so to speak) of incoming requests... Much like the useless, trolling comments of people posting "you imagined it all" (etc) in the comments section. Delete them all, I say! Well, okay, keep maybe the first one but the rest are not adding to the discussion.
The newsnetscotland team have been careful to say they are not 100% certain that it was a DDoS attack - so, yes, maybe snafu. But it is interesting the that Caledonian Mercury online newspaper () is now also sufferring an outage of some sort. What a run of bad luck those websites in Scotland are having tooday
Just keep prosecuting these criminals
The more hackers they send to prison the better.
Hackers?
Hackers? Where?
Media bias
Regarding "SNP accused" - try Googling the Scotsman (scotsman.com) for each main political party. You should find the following:
- "SNP accused" : 11800 results
- "Labour accused" : 1660 results
- "Conservatives accused" : 217 results
- "Lib dems accused" : 300 results
And of course, let's not forget that the Herald editor was allegedly snorting cocaine with Stephen Purcell. To give it an IT angle, reading either of these papers alone is akin to reading Microsoft-sponsored surveys on Linux - pretty worthless on its own.
What's great about this bias, though, is it allows cretins such as Iain Gray to rise to the fore, over-promoted and underqualified, and rather perversely undermine the media tactics that seek to promote him. Even with all the king's army and all the king's journalists behind him, his feckless demeanor is apparent to anyone with an IQ in double digits.
This media strategy also means the SNP have to be twice as good as anyone else to survive - one false step and they're mince - which means we get better government. A win-win situation!
@other Anon Coward
I don't see signs of post suggesting it wasn't a DDOS being removed.
I do see some ABUSIVE posts being removed, but I suspect that that is common practice for many MODS
There are posts there saying that it's a bit early to call as a DDOS, or if it is, it might not be targetted at Newsnetscotland, so your argument kind of falls down there
Corrections
Most of them have been re-added. Had an email from their site saying their moderators are entirely separate from their editorial team, so they would appear to be lacking a little in communication. The posts were from their hosts then anyone else who was interacting with the host. Those comments have since been readded a couple of hours later on.
An edit to one of the host's posts from the moderators says they will be updating the main story soon. That was over an hour ago, though.
It wasn't a DDoS.
Newsnet Scotland
What Hanimex says.
The fact that Newsnets host server reported that the site had collapsed under the weight of 'unprecedented activity' is surely cause enough for a wee bit of alarm?
Yesterdays 'top story' was a fairly succinct analysis of BBC Scotland's preceived bias. Given that we have a daily dose of Reporting Labour it's no wonder Independence supporters, myself included and thought the worse.
It's fairly obvious from some of the comments above that since Devolution, not too many of our Southern brethren are aware of what politics is like in Scotland. Give Newsnet a chance, it's an honest attempt to redress open bias.
Call them what you want
Call them hackers or crackers or DDoS attackers. As long as they go to prison for violating law, it's all good.
correction
Looks like it wasn't a DDOS, but a coding issue. Thank flip for that
Loony dribbling CyberNat that I am, I've been on El Reg to long to not know that seeming DDOS attacks can happen for innocent reasons
And before the Reg staff get too cocky, they published Ted Dziuba.
No one's perfect, just sayin'
Dead again
Down again with a DB connection error.
No DDoS occurred
From their website:
The Newsnet Scotland website has resumed almost normal function and the cause of the service disruption yesterday has been located. We have been able to decipher that it was not a D DOS attack as previously thought. The matter is that an adjustment to a module created in essence a shortcut which caused a high volume of cyclic activity in the server. The hosting service provider had no alternative but to shut down the site.
In an attempt to resolve the problem quickly and respond to a high volume of enquiries regarding service disruption we sought advice from external advisors and understood the feedback information as confirming an attack. You will be pleased to know that we have put procedures in place to ensure that such a problem does not occur again.
We regret the inconvenience caused to our readers by not being able to access our site and we would also like to thank our readers for the ongoing support seen through the numerous comments and constructive criticism on our outage article. We stand by our hosting provider's decision to remove the site from view till the problem was resolved.
We regret alarming our readers and would like to reassure you the team remains committed to bringing you new fresh news content every day. Newsnet Scotland will continue to report and publish our perspective on Scottish politics and current affairs.
Good News
So presumably now an apology to all those organisations which were smeared by staff and commentators in saying that this was a deliberate attack by their political opponents?

Re: Not what I was waiting for
I'll 2nd that. The N8 is my first ever symbian phone and it just works - fantastic battery life, solid design, and has enough decent apps it can be used on the car console (sweet driving mode+maps).
My N9 is lovely too (from Malayasia apparently), but battery life is not even close to the N8. Screen is wonderful, and the linux is reassuring. You can hit an icon and broadcast the phone to your desktop, social media etc..
We'll all just have to see what the Jolla/Sailfish folks can bring out...
Re: Suse Studio
The whole openbuild environment is extremely impressive. Especially when you want to hack/build a package without installing everything on your home machine.
I too moved to Suse some time back, originally as a Redhat refugee , but mostly because we have it everywhere at work, and I have 6 desktops around the world, that all look that same...!
If there becomes a way to run android apps on a normal opensuse desktop (not Vbox), I would say we had reached a nice state of being...

Re: Whatever they do, I'm grateful
Hi,
My $0.02.
First - for the indexing stuff ,I couldn't agree more. Just rpm -e the lot of them, and occasionally run updatedb and use GNU locate. Either that, or OpenSuse need to make some more reasonable defaults for what it searches...
There are also some external factors (NVIDIA being one), where these drivers are *critical* to maintain the KDE desktop (or in my case 3D+CUDA) , but are not controlled by OpenSuse. The ftp website, for example, is always lagging behind the latest NVidia drivers, which leaves one with a "compromised" system by using the Nvidia installer rather than rpm.
I have many machines with OpenSuse, because although a linuxhead, I do not want to spend unnecessary time configuring basic stuff, so perhaps this rethink will improve things?
P.
and the winner is....
It would seem that the NHS is big enough to have its own bespoke system - a move to a provably open source framework, would be a first step. Not paying enormous consultants for the "wintel solution of the day" is probably a first step....
but then again...
I was just at SC11, and we really need faster (lower latency) networks for a whole host of tightly coupled scientific problems. This doesn't sound all bad, if it addresses

I am wondering if your surgeon is willing to refer you to a pain management specialist.
My neuro-surgeon referred me to pain management as he believed that I needed more pain med than he felt comfortable prescribing.
This was years ago.
You can also click on my name or little pic to read a very brief narrative of my history.
Pain management prescribed a long-acting opiate to be taken twice a day PLUS a short acting for breakthrough pain. That is to be taken only now-and-then when I really need it.
I also have an implanted spinal cord stimulator. For me, it has been a miracle in pain management.
What does ALIF mean? When you say, "injections through my tailbone", are you referring to epidural steroid injections? Did these help at all?
Is the surgery that's being considered an L5-S1 fusion?
So, in brief, I would ask and hope that the surgeon, with whom it sounds as if you have a good relationship, to refer you to pain management.
Keep us updated, ok?

Some folks use initials or abbreviations that I don't understand at all.
Take care, Annette
I haven't been on the site for a few days.
Duh, my lumbar fusion is also anterior approach and I am an RN. I should have known that.
More later. I'm just reading the new posts now.

Re: subscribe
I'm an economics grad student working on my dissertation,
which involves multi-agent simulations of an artificial economy which
will hopefully exhibit some endogenous fluctuations (ie. a business]
cycle---think of my thesis as "SimRecession"). I don't know anyone
in the econ dept. who knows anything about mathematica, and I've
run into a small but extremely aggravating anomaly in the way
mathematica interprets symbols on the rhs of functions definitions.
I'll gladly send an example of the problem to the mailing list if you
think that's appropriate, or if you have any idea how I could get
help with this problem.
To give you a brief idea of what the problem is:
I have a function defined
alg[{p2_,p3_}] := {p2,p3} - r market[{p2,p3}]
I want to be able to name {p2,p3} on the right hand side,
but if I just enter
p = {p2,3}
mathematica treats p2,p3 as independent symbols, not as arguments of
the function. I have similiar but more complicated problems in
making sure that the auxiliary function market[{p2,p3}] spits out
something that will be interpreted as an argument of the function
and not just "p2" or "p3". My ultimate goal is to right the
function alg as alg[{x___}] so I can call up a variable number
of arguments defined elsewhere.
Le me know if this is a suitable topic for the mailing list,
or if you know of any other possible sources of advice.
Thanks a lot, Ann Bell

A Polish governmental institute closed an investigation into the 1941 murder of 20 Jewish women in northeastern Poland, unable to name the victims or perpetrators.
Prosecutors for the Institute of National Remembrance in Bialystok could not determine the names of the victims, nor did they discover the identities of six of the seven perpetrators who went on trial in the 1950s for the crime.
They had opened the investigation last June into the deaths in Bzury in an effort to discover the names of the victims and other perpetrators while there potentially were still witnesses alive to identify them.
One of the killers, Stanislaw Zalewski, was given a prison term after originally being sentenced to death.
Prosecutor Radoslaw Ignatiew confirmed that the murderers were Poles, according to the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
The murdered women from the ghetto in Szczuczyn were employed for field work in Bzury. They were taken to the woods and killed after being robbed and, in some cases, raped.
The Institute of National Remembrance was established in 1998 by the Polish Parliament to preserve the memory of the losses suffered by the country from World War.

FYM ABIDES: OUR HERO JEFF “THE DUDE” DOWD
Way out West there is this fella I wanna tell ya about. Goes by the name of Jeff Dowd. It pains me to say how jealous this Art Director is of our Publicist Nick ‘Way to go Donnie!’ Codling currently. Flying on Virgin America today, Nick was able to meet one of FYM’s heroes (what’s a hero anyway) Jeff “THE DUDE” Dowd, (that’s right THE ACTUAL DUDE Jeff Bridges character in The Big Lebowski was based off of, and inspiring member of the Seattle Seven).
Unlike past sightings, Nick actually landed the photo this time (pictured above, with the White Russian Nick got him). The Dudes legacy still abides, giving hope and inspiration to all the young dudes across America to keep on, keeping on.
Dowd today continues to be a major player/writer/producer in Hollywood. It’s cool to see a guy famous and sooo relatable for just being, well a Dude. So this Jam of the Day goes out to the El Duderino himself, Jeff ‘THE DUDE’ Dowd. Sometimes there’s a man.. Sometimes… there’s a man. It’s a jam written by David Bowie, that Ian Hunter and Mott The Hoople rock out.
‘All The Young Dudes’
Check out The Dudes website for current info on all of this projects HERE. Dude if you’re out there, this Art Director would love to buy you a drink in Seattle tonight.
Cheers,
FYM

Ella Gourlay and the Nute volleyball team are focused on the Division III championship tonight against Winnisquam in Plymouth.
PLYMOUTH — The Nute High School volleyball team figured it was probably a year away from challenging for a state title.Well, next year is this year.The No. 5 Rams (16-3) will play in tonight’s Division III championship at Plymouth State University against No. 6 Winnisquam (15-4) at 7 p.m. Nute, with one senior on the roster, advanced with playoff wins over No. 12 Trinity, No. 5 Hillsboro-Deering and, most recently, No. 1 Campbell in Wednesday’s semifinal. It beat Winnisquam twice during the regular season, both times 3-1.“I’m hoping we can keep the momentum up and carry it through,” said Nute coach Kristin Wilson, who led the Rams to a state title in 2006 as a player. “They deserve it. They work hard.”Winnisquam works hard, too. The Bears impressed with wins over No. 3 Moultonborough in the quarters in five tight games and No. 2 Farmington in the semis in four games. Senior-laden Farmington was likely the pre-tournament favorite in mid-October when the Tigers were 14-0. But they went 2-3 down the stretch, losing twice to Winnisquam.Both Nute and Winnisquam enter tonight’s final on a six-match win streak and with largely underclassmen lineups. Nute was the last team to beat the Bears on Oct. 8. Winnisquam eliminated the Rams from the 2011 tournament in the quarterfinal round.“They looked good,” Wilson said of the Bears. “It’s going to be willpower. Who can play the hardest and stay mentally up. My team can get down when they lose three or four points. They’ve got to come back strong and swinging. That’s what we’ve got to do against Winnisquam.”The Rams struggled early in their semifinal match with No. 1 and then unbeaten Campbell. They had six service errors in dropping the first game and were down 21-17 in Game 2, facing a potential 2-0 deficit.“I think in the second game a light bulb came on,” Wilson said. “They said, ‘We remember how to play volleyball.’ They started to hit. They started to swing. They started serving better.”The Rams came back to win that game 25-23 and then won the next two to take the match.Sophomore outside hitter Alisha Flanagan had a monster match with 13 kills and 14 digs. Junior setter Michelle Guindon added 30 assists and nine digs, while junior middle hitter Heidi Cloutier had nine kills, sophomore Kristina Cerniauskas added 14 digs, and junior Ella Gourlay contributed seven kills, seven digs and four of the team’s 13 aces.But the Rams can’t afford to come out slow against Winnisquam.“We need to start strong and continue to stay strong,” Guindon said. “(Wednesday) we started way down. We need to start at the top of our game and continue. Winnisquam’s a good team. We just watched them beat Farmington. That’s the best I’ve seen Winnisquam play. We just need to know it’s not going to be an easy game at all.”The Bears were led by versatile senior setter Elyssa Clairmont, who had eight kills and 35 assists. Earlier this month she crested the 1,000 assist mark for her career.Winnisquam’s primary hitters were also effective. Hannah Chapin, a 5-9 junior, had 18 kills and 10 digs, while 6-1 junior Bailey Long added 10 kills and four aces. Mo Raymond chipped in with seven kills and 12 digs.“They have a few good hitters we need to watch out for,” Gourlay added. “We just need to play our game.”This is Nute’s first trip to the final since 2009, when the Rams were making the last of five straight trips to the final. That run included three consecutive titles and a 54-match winning streak.“They are a very strong team. They have no purpose being the No. 5 seed,” Winnisquam coach Mike Livernois said. “I’ve been saying all along to anyone who would listen to me that even though Farmington had the better record, Nute was the strongest team we’ve faced all year.“They attack very well. They cover the floor very well,” added Livernois. “We are going to have to work very hard to get ahead of them. We’ll need an exceptional serving and serve receive night.”Winnisquam won the title in 2010 and lost in the semis last year to Moultonborough as the No. 1 seed.“Last year they knocked us out of the tournament,” Wilson added. “That was a big thing for us also. That’s going to be big in the final. Can Nute step up and knock Winnisquam out of the tournament? Or are they going to beat us again.”

Holt McCallany, left, as Karl Lockwood, and Sean Penn, as Mickey Cohen, in the film, “Gangster Squad.”
LOS ANGELES (AP) — "Gangster Squad" director Ruben Fleischer was stepping out of the shower on the night of July 20 last year when he received a chilling phone call from a studio executive at Warner Bros. There had been a deadly shooting at a midnight screening of "The Dark Knight Rises" in Aurora, Colo. The studio was pulling the trailer for its "Gang theater this week's replaying of the July theater horror in a Colorado courtroom just as the film prepares to finally open on Friday.
Fleischer couldn't initially process what was happening in that moment when he was on the phone last summer but eventually, everyone involved with "Gang theater sequence featuring Josh Brolin's hard-boiled cop John O'Mara being ambushed inside famed Hollywood movie palace Grauman's Chinese Theater was excised from "Gangster Squad." For many of the film's cast and crew members, it was their favorite scene in the highly stylized theater."
Several members of the cast and crew reassembled nearly a year after filming completed on "Gang this week coincidentally comes at the same time that 25-year-old James Holmes, who is charged with killing 12 people and injuring 70 in the July theater shooting, is appearing at a weeklong preliminary hearing to determine whether the case will,  Dennis."

Straight from the dark heart of Italy
Richard Whittle
With the week’s international friendlies taking a large number of Serie A stars off on their travels, the coaches gathered at Coverciano on Monday for a technical meeting and to award the Panchina d'Oro (Golden Bench) for the coach of the year.
The award went to Jose Mourinho, who was snubbed last time round in favour of Massimiliano Allegri - but with the Portuguese (and his ego) now safely out of the country – and a treble winner - he is at last being given some credit by his former peers in Italy.
The day also offered an opportunity to swap ideas and listen to the latest musings on the game. The Italy squad were also at the Federation headquarters preparing for their match against Germany - so the coaches could keep an eye on their charges if they wished.
The majority of Italy players are as pious as cardinals when on Azzurri duty, but there is always the odd one or two who will use the occasion to break with club protocol - hence Allegri dropped in on Antonio Cassano to ensure that his recent signing was sticking to his diet.
There were no reports of the AC Milan coach finding empty jars of Nutella on the windowsill or chocolate wrappers hidden under the player’s mattress, but no doubt the portly Bari boy will be on the scales when he returns to Milanello on Thursday - just to be sure.
The pair had a quick word or two at the café inside the complex, where the player swore that lunch had been nothing more exciting than chicken before lifting his training top and tucking in his tummy - as if that was going to fool anyone.
Cassano arrived at Milan at the turn of the year looking well fed after being exiled from the Sampdoria squad for reportedly swearing in a different manner at club president Riccardo Garrone.
And for someone more in love with self-indulgence than self-discipline, Cassano has found it difficult to shed the excess baggage: in fact, he has made the latter-day Ronaldinho look almost svelte in comparison.
"ROOM SERVICE!"
Even the much-vaunted MilanLab have not been able to put any spin on Tony’s weight-gain plan - which is no surprise considering he has revealed that when he retires he plans to get fat, really fat.
There is no denying the skill and tricky are still there, but the initial thrill of seeing Cassano waddle on as a second-half substitute to set-up a goal or two has worn off somewhat amongst the Rossoneri faithful, who have now witnessed the league leaders draw their last two games in a worryingly collective wobble of their own.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic has admitted he is beginning to feel the strain of being the first name on the team-sheet and the Swede certainly has not been as sharp or clinical in front of goal in the last two games; spending more time growling at his team-mates than roaring past defenders.
A little R&R would no doubt not go amiss, but that seems unlikely - not with Cassano unable to last the pace and Allegri seemingly not yet having enough faith in Alexandre Pato to allow him to lead the line, despite the Brazilian netting a more than an adequate nine goals in 14 league appearances.
Cassano will at least have a opportunity to sweat off a few pounds in Dortmund, scene of that never to be forgotten World Cup semi-final in 2006, where Cesare Prandelli will hand him yet another ‘last chance’ – let’s hope he still has the appetite to take it this time round.
More hungry to leave his mark at international level is another descendant of the Italian Diaspora, Thiago Motta who will make his debut this evening.
The Inter midfielder has felt the tug of the old country on his heart strings for some time – his great grandfather emigrated from the Veneto region for South America when he was in his early 20s – which at the time you would have to say was not a bad move.
It seems that for now Prandelli has given up attempting to groom home-grown talent for the central midfield role alongside Daniele De Rossi, with Italo-Argentine Cristian Ledesma another of the ‘new Italians’ to don the Azurri jersey.
It may not have gone down too well with the tifosi, but if these homecoming sons - as with Mauro Cameronesi in the past – help lift the national side out of the doldrums, then boos will soon turn to cheers. And as Cassano will almost certainly testify, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

breaking news
For the second time this month,an area motel robbed. And police say the two crimes may not be coincidental. The Ramada Inn on Rangeline in Joplin was robbed early this morning. Police say two white males entered the motel with bandanas coving their faces. One suspect was armed with a small caliber handgun. Authorities say the two suspects got away with an undetermined amount of cash. Police say they are looking into the possibility that the robbery could be connected to a robbery at the same motel on July 4th. The suspects were last seen leaving south behind the Ramada Inn. One suspect is described as being around five feet, seven inches tall, weighing between 160 and 170 pounds. If you have any information, call the Joplin Police department at 623-3131.

If you are inclined to agree with Rush Limbaugh, it is possible you agree with his contention that The Dark Knight Rises is liberal propaganda smearing Mitt Romney.
“Do you think it is accidental that the name of the really vicious, fire-breathing, four-eyed, whatever-it-is villain in this movie is named Bane?" Limbaugh asked on his radio show. He added, “So this evil villain in the new Batman movie is named Bane. And there's discussion out there as to whether or not this was purposeful and whether or not it will influence voters. It.”
Never mind that Bane was created and introduced in 1993. Or that the third entry in director Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy basically went into production the second after The Dark Knight hit theaters in 2008 and selected Bane as its villain long before Romney was the last GOP presidential candidate standing.
Limbaugh’s reaction was predictable. He and many other conservatives never pass on an opportunity to bash Hollywood and lament what they see as rampant liberalism in mainstream movies. It happens at least a few times a year. Back in February The Lorax was accused of brainwashing kids with pro-environment propaganda.
The problem with these claims is that Hollywood only cares about one color, and it’s not blue. Yes, there is no shortage of liberals in the entertainment industry. But that is a matter of personal politics. Movie studios need their products to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. They are aggressively seeking the best possible return on their investments.
The fact is movie studios now are part of huge corporations. Universal is controlled by Comcast. Columbia is part of the Sony family. Paramount is part of Viacom. And what are the primary objectives of corporations? Maximize shareholder value and turn a profit. Make as much money as humanly possible. Everything else is secondary.
Hollywood will jump on any trend if it thinks there is money in it. Right now cheaply made “found footage” horror movies are popular. They are low risk, high reward.
Another example of this is faith-based films. After the runaway success of The Passion of the Christ, numerous studios got involved in producing and distributing movies aimed at viewers of faith. Sony Pictures Entertainment has Affirm Films. Their titles include Courageous and Fireproof. Samuel Goldwyn Films occasionally releases faith-based films including this year’s October Baby. New Line, part of Warner Bros. Entertainment, released The Nativity Story.
Often studios hold advanced screenings for churches to generate positive word of mouth with “spiritual” audiences even if the movie isn’t overtly faith-based. Prior to releasing Secretariat in 2010, Disney held screenings at large churches across the country.
The studios saw new revenue streams with these viewers. There was demand so they made sure to meet it. The same is true for the low-budget horror movies. After Paranormal Activity, everyone jumped on the bandwagon. The studios and the people running them just see dollar signs.
Warner Bros. spent $400 million to make and market The Dark Knight Rises. It needs to make far more than that to become profitable. The studio is not going to risk alienating millions of potential ticket buyers by making an overtly political film.
As The Hollywood Reporter points out today, there was a lot of debate about the politics of The Dark Knight. Both conservatives and liberals found ideological messages in it and the same will probably be true of The Dark Knight Rises. Many viewers will read into it what they want to and seek to find messages that are aligned with their beliefs.
However one feels about the movie and its content, the only thing the studio cares about is whether or not you buy a ticket.

I guess the barrel of burning issues has about bottomed out.
James R Hoffa
10:30 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
@Mr. Doro -
"The studio is not going to risk alienating millions of potential ticket buyers by making an overtly political film."
So then, exactly how did Oliver Stone's so-called biopic films about JFK, Nixon, and George W Bush ever get greed lighted? And why do the studios now agree to front Michael Moore millions of dollars to produce his line of so-called documentaries?
The mere existence of the Fox News and MSNBC pundits show that there is a demand for both right and left leaning political fare. And while the ratings of those two networks would suggest a far larger audience for right-wing political fare, Hollywood has consistently turned out more left-wing political fare. Need I even mention HBO Films as being a notoriously liberal production house?
So, how exactly do you reconcile the discrepancy between apparent demand vs the product actually turned out by Hollywood?
Paul Doro
10:33 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
Oliver Stone's films are biopics that did not cost $400 million to make and market. Michael Moore's documentaries make money. Like I said, they are in the business of making money.
James R Hoffa
11:18 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
And documentaries made from the right-wing perspective on issues wouldn't make money? Wouldn't the ratings of Fox News definitely prove otherwise?
So, just because Stone's biopics didn't cost hundreds of millions to produce and market, the studio was in fact willing to "risk alienating millions of potential ticket buyers by making an overtly political film?"
While I agree that a company's primary purpose is to make money, it often appears that Hollywood does take on the risk of alienating audience members by making controversial and/or biased product. And in taking such risks when it comes to overtly political film making, Hollywood tends to lean to the left more often than the right.
Paul Doro
11:21 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
You can't really avoid politics in a biopic about Kennedy, Nixon, or Bush can you? An exception every once in a while does not change the fact that it's still all about the money. Biopics are often chasing awards and prestige and that can lead to more money. And right-wing documentaries are made and released all the time. Just last weekend one played in Houston and did very well.
James R Hoffa
11:27 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
"And right-wing documentaries are made and released all the time."
Without going to the IMDb or other online resources, how many right-wing documentaries can you name that Hollywood funded a wide release of vs left-wing documentaries?
Yeah, I rest my case!
Paul Doro
11:28 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
The studios really don't fund documentaries James. They are often picked up for distribution after they are made.
James R Hoffa
11:35 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
You're right, that's why I qualified my statement with "funded a wide release of," as documentarians typically don't fund their own wide releases - usually the studios do this.
And the studios tend to take on the risk of wide distribution of left-wing perspective documentaries much more than they do right-wing perspective documentaries.
Paul Doro
11:37 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
Also very few documentaries receive anything close to a wide release. And the major studios are rarely involved with documentaries.
James R Hoffa
11:44 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
For theatrical releases, I agree. Moore is a very big exception though. However, every major studio has an art-house division for direct-to-video release and distribution of such fare. And one again, more left-wing product is consistently picked up than right-wing product for even the direct-to-video distribution. HBO Films is a perfect example of engaging in both the production and distribution of consistently left-wing biased product - even you must admit to this reality!
Paul Doro
11:51 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
And Moore's last three films were released by Overture and Lionsgate, not one of the major studios. And only Fahrenheit 9/11 received a wide release. The art house divisions are not really for direct-to-DVD movies. They are for Oscar bait and serious stuff more than anything. I think people probably see the bias they want to see in the films HBO makes.
James R Hoffa
12:08 pm on Thursday, July 19, 2012
"And Moore's last three films were released by Overture and Lionsgate, not one of the major studios."
You don't consider Lionsgate to be a major Hollywood player? They're publicly traded on the NYSE for heaven's sake! They have more quarterly output and revenue than is generated by MGM/UA!
"The art house divisions are not really for direct-to-DVD movies."
Really? And how many Fox Searchlight pictures received a theatrical release? The art-house divisions are where the studios tend to put the documentary product that they pick-up, isn't it? And how is a majority of the product that is released and distributed through the art-house divisions done exactly? I'll help you out here - direct-to-video.
"They are for Oscar bait and serious stuff more than anything."
You mean they're not all about making money? Many of those films are funded with government tax credits and art endowment grants.
"I think people probably see the bias they want to see in the films HBO makes."
Yeah, because it's totally not apparent. Game Change (2012) was 100% historically accurate and provided an accurate depiction of the people portrayed in the film, right? But isn't there a problem when the actual people who are portrayed in the film come out and say that the film is little more than a politically biased hit job that totally distorts the truth of what really happened?
Come on!
Paul Doro
12:13 pm on Thursday, July 19, 2012
Almost all Fox Searchlight movies receive a theatrical release, just not a wide one. Again, the art house divisions are for awards fare and prestige films far more than they are for direct-to-DVD movies.
Lionsgate is a major Hollywood player, sure, now more than they were back when they released Moore movies. They're not Paramount or Universal though.
James R Hoffa
12:47 pm on Thursday, July 19, 2012
So Hollywood makes bank on limited non-wide theatrical engagements? If it wasn't for the tax credits and art endowment grants to make many of those films, wouldn't many of them have produced actual losses for the producers and studios distributing them?
When Lionsgate merged with Trimark Pictures, their combined rental and home video distribution system became far better than anything that either Viacom (Paramount) or MCA Universal has in such regard.

Paul, If I could give you an award for this blog, I would call it The Hoover Award, because you are the biggest sucker. (I don't say that in a mean way) Rush Limbaugh, just like the movie studios, is in it for the money. He is an entertainer, he presents his opinion. If your head was not nodding so hard to Ed Schultz's babble, you would see he is just an entertainer. Bill Mahr, entertainer. Keith Olbermann, entertainer. Mark Behling, entertainer. They are all in it for the "green". Limbaugh and Belling would tell you that Obama is great for their ratings and bottom line. Schultz and Maddow may say the same thing about Walker or Romney, it's for the money. Ed does not take home an average UAW wage, these people are part of the 1%. Every one of them will use the same tax loopholes that the big corporations and CEOs use. Much of the stuff that Olbermann and Schultz spew is based less on fact than entertainment value. Get some pop corn, sit back and enjoy the show.
Paul Doro
11:46 am on Thursday, July 19, 2012
Don't watch Schultz or MSNBC, or Olbermann. So is the sucker actually the one making assumptions without really knowing what they speak of? I used Limbaugh to make broader points about Hollywood and accusations of liberal propaganda in film. Of course Rush is an entertainer in it for the money. That is stating the obvious.
Greg
12:07 pm on Thursday, July 19, 2012
"Don't watch Schultz or MSNBC, or Olbermann."
Maybe you should, so you would have a more rounded view for your next blog. Otherwise "So is the sucker actually the one making assumptions without really knowing what they speak of?", is nothing more than a commentary on yourself.
Paul Doro
12:14 pm on Thursday, July 19, 2012
How would watching more MSNBC have influenced a blog about liberal propaganda in Hollywood movies?

I believe Rush would call this a media tweak and fell face first into it.
Keith Schmitz

@Greg's right. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer, one of the first of the "shock jocks." My father, a Goldwater-era Republican, doesn't listen to Rush Limbaugh.
While some of these polititainment shows are interesting, they are no substitute for independent research and should serve as a starting point for that research rather than oracles.
There are many Batman movies and I have seen very few of them. I'll confess I enjoy movies for entertainment value, but real life is far more exciting!

2:17 pm on Thursday, July 19, 2012
Personally, Hoffa prefers the Tim Burton Batman films staring Michael Keaton in the headline role to the Christopher Nolan Dark Knight series of films.
As far as radio pundits go, there is no comparison to the great Michael Savage!
Heather Asiyanbi
4:59 pm on Thursday, July 19, 2012
@Hoffa. UGH - really? The Burton films? Oy. No way. The Nolan trilogy (I assume since TDKR isn't officially released yet) far surpass the Keaton franchise when it comes to writing, set design, directing, villains (Ledger's Joker is legend for good reason), and acting. Burton's set reminds me of cheesy B-movies in comparison.
James R Hoffa
5:36 pm on Thursday, July 19, 2012
@Heather A -
I think I told you my fondness for the Burton/Keaton Batman films once before, on FB, and you had the same reaction :-)
How can Batman get any better than Burton directing, Keaton as Batman, Nicholson as the Joker, Michael Gough as Alfred, the best Batmobile ever to grace the screen, and a soundtrack from Prince?!?! That film inspired a ride at Six Flags for heaven's sakes, and the sequel a live stage show at the theme park!
OK, I admit I love B-movies and am biased to the '80's/'90's nostalgia factor! Not to mention that I find it hard to embrace most of the new / young blood acting talent, although Bale's not bad.
I also prefer Roger Corman's unreleased 1994 version of the 'Fantastic Four' to the Hollywood films!

Hard to weight them Jimmy. Though the Nicholson/Burton pairing seemed good on paper, they were essentially cartons.
The latest pack is grim and excessive. How many times can Bruce Wayne get wiped out?
James R Hoffa
11:01 am on Friday, July 20, 2012
@Schmitzy -
That's funny - I would have figured you for a George Clooney as Batman fan!
Come on - Burton also benefited from Danny Elfman's score and original music from Prince which is far more iconic and 'Batman like' than Hans Zimmers work and any of the songs used in the Dark Knight series. Just compare these two scenes and you'll see there's no comparison:
Now, let's compare the stats on Batman: The Ride vs The Dark Knight Coaster:
Batman: The Ride
Height 105 ft
Length 2,694 ft
Speed 50 mph
Inversions 5
Duration 2:00
The Dark Knight Coaster:
Height 45 ft
Length 1,213 ft
Speed 30 mph
Inversions 0
Duration 2:00
See, even Six Flags recognizes that Burton and Keaton own Nolan and Bale!
Case closed ;-)

11:14 am on Friday, July 20, 2012
I hope that we can all agree that the worse thing to happen in the Batman universe was the Halle Berry stinker Catwoman (2004) - now there's a pos that should be erased from history by the film gods! Yes, it was even worse than the George Clooney / Schumacher film Batman & Robin (1997).

We stayed at the Hyatt Fairfax for three days to visit Washington DC. The hotel is located about 20 minutes from DC. A bit confusing to find of the... freeway but we got the hang of it after the first day. The hotel is clean and the room was spacious. Our room had a king and a double bed. My daughter loves to swim, however we found the pool was not open in the morning. The breakfast in the Nova Grill was great and we had excellent service. We would stay again if we return to the DC area. de Steve A de Toronto, ON le 22/03/2013

ZF-3408: Zend_Config does not decrease $_count when node is unset()
Description
The count() method, defined by the Countable interface, uses $this->_count, which is set in the constructor of Zend_Config. The problem now is, when you unset a value (done via the magic method __unset()), $this->_count is not decreased by one. So when you count() the Zend_Config object after you unset a node, you get the wrong number.

<p>I'm wondering if it might not be prudent to establish a common Zend_Image API and then to allow for multiple backends. In addition to GD, ImageMagick is another frequently used backend for which someone may at some point wish to implement a core module. The API detailed here looks very good in terms of being backend-independent and it should only take the addition of a method to specify which backend to use in order to implement what I'm describing. Perhaps an interface Zend_Image_API and a method Zend_Image::setBackend(Zend_Image_API). Thoughts?</p>

<p>autoThumbnail</p>
<p>setPercentage - have not right idea. <br />
If i want resize image by one edge, how i can do it? <br />
It's needed when in template all images must have equals height (getted by percent from original size).</p>
<p>Same in "setSize" <br />
usage, i know only result height, and width may be either<br />
So, method must be like: setSize(integer $width=null, integer $height=null)</p>
<p>And another one question: Let me know how resizing image with crop or save original geometry? </p>
<p>PS: Don't kick me for my english <ac:emoticon ac: </p>

<p>Erik,</p>
<p>your proposal looks good. I'd certainly use it.</p>
<p>About your Thumbnail class. It would be nice to have a method that resizes the image in one of three ways (either given as parameter, or as several methods):</p>
<ul class="alternate">
<li>resize until either height or width fits within given boundary and crop the image (you'll make a center cutout, but image width and height are predictable)</li>
<li>resize until both height and width fit within given boundaries (meaning that the exact size of the image is not predictable, but different for each image).</li>
<li>lose original geometry and fit the image in the boundaries (thus messing up the original)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, as Eugene mentioned, it would be nice to be able to enter either one of height and width.</p>
<p>If you need any help with the implementation, let me know: <last name>@gmail.com</p>

<p>However, working on image-manipulation for PHP is a great thing to do. We encourage you to get involved with the ImageMagick project: <a class="external-link" href=""></a></p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:macro>

Liberty on Tap since 1984
By Nancy Thorner and Ed Ingold
The administration, supported by the liberal media, denies that anyone apologized to the Islamic world for offending them. They take the narrow view that an apology expresses remorse for some offense the speaker has committed. In the rhetorical sense, however, an apology occurs when the speaker attempts to justify the wrongs anyone has committed, including someone else. Marc Antony's speech to the Romans was phrased as an apology for Caesar's faults, with surprising consequences.
That's precisely the substance of apologies uttered by the State Department, which justified attacks on the interests of the United States by Islamic militants by blaming them on an obscure video clip that hardly anyone had seen up to that point. It was compounded by apologies spoken by Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, on television in Pakistan, paid for by the US Government.
Like Antony's speech, this too had surprising consequences. Much like the firemen in Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451", who poured kerosene on burning books, this Administration continues to inflame the radicals and spread the violence.
We can't expect much support from the United Nations, which not too long ago appointed Muamar Gaddafi the head of the UN Council on Human Rights.
We probably can't expect more than sympathy from most of Europe, where it is a crime to say many things, even to defame a public official.
We certainly can't expect much of anything from nations where religion is the government, and free speech is considered blasphemy. However, if we fail to defend our nation's interests, and hold our concept of human rights up as an example to the rest of the world, we makes ourselves look weak to our friends and enemies alike, and invite further attacks.
What we need is an apology worthy of a Roman warrior, which places shame on the assassins, rather than our country and its principles, and inflames the quest for justice.
This nation, and especially Israel, cannot depend on President Obama to be that Roman warrior. It would upset Obama's carefully crafted, false image of himself, reinforced by the mainstream media, as one who is tough on terrorism.
Remaining in power with unlimited and unchecked power is all that matters to President Obama. He will say and do anything to retain his control, knowing that the mainstream media will function as his protective gear.
May that fearless Roman warrior soon show itself before it is too late and remorseful appeasement apologies lead to catastrophic consequences for Israel and this nation. Hopefully Mitt Romney is up to it!

Desperate.
Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) limited federal welfare payments to five years and conditioned them on a recipient’s effort to find work—in essence, stripping welfare of its entitlement status. As a result, the welfare rolls dropped two-thirds from 1996 to 2009, work rates of never-married mothers surged, and black child poverty fell to its lowest level ever.
But according to Times reporter Jason DeParle, TANF has not performed as it should have during the recession. Rather than skyrocketing, the welfare rolls have risen “only” 15 percent since 2007, and still remain 68 percent below their pre-reform peak..

Skip to comments.There is a tsunami of evidence that the man that sits in the White House is not who he says he is.
Posted on 04/15/2012 7:14:16 AM PDT by IbJensen
Pictures of Barack Obama are surfacing on a scholarly research site that show him shouting through a bull horn in front of possible members of the African Luo tribe named as his ancestors in Kenya. Other pictures without captions show Obama in African tribal attire with two other men; and with at least 10 men in western clothes. Yet another picture shows him with a group of women wearing traditionally African attire that may or may not be his relatives.
Attorney Stephen Pidgeon, author of the book THE OBAMA ERROR, states
that because he released his COLB (certificate of live birth) on the White House website, prima facie evidence exists to investigate Obamas birth and eligibility as proscribed by our Constitutions Article II, Section I, clause 5.
Another book, THE OBAMAS-AN UNTOLD STORY OF AN AFRICAN FAMILY traces the origins of Obamas lineage through the African Luo tribe which goes back 800 years to the southern Sudan region along the Nile River.
Obamas Luo line dates back to his 10th removed great grandfather Owiny. The name Obama is thought to have come from Onyango Mobam a man born with a curved back.
The Luos were both hunters and gatherers but also polygamous so tracing exact lineage could be confusing says the books author Peter Firstbrook. Their many wives lived apart from their husbands who had their six front teeth knocked out as the time honored rite of passage into manhood.
Obamas grandfather, Hussein Onyango, born in 1895, embraced European culture but rejected Christianity when he converted to Islam. Obamas father was born to this mans third wife Habiba Akuma in 1936, but the elder was broken by torture during the violent Mau Mau uprisings, leaving his now 92 year old fifth wife Sarah, still living , to rear the Presidents father. Kindly Sarah reared many orphans in her village and reports even quote her as saying Obama, Jr. passed through her hands when he was born.
Attorney Pidgeon told radio listeners, when Illinois Senator Obama involved himself in Kenyan national affairs that is a clear violation of the Logan Act (18 U.S. C.A 953[1948]. This act makes it a crime for a citizen to involve himself or confer with or negotiate with foreign governments in opposition to the United States without clear authorization. The attorney is also troubled by Obamas sending American assets into Libya without Congressional approval!
The Jay Treaty of the War of 1812 states; if you ever were a British subject, you could NEVER be a Natural Born Citizen of the U.S. This brings home the NBC issue for Pidgeon who says The Constitution is Finished. America took up arms again against Great Britain when she started impressing U.S. sailors for service in the Royal Navy.
Attorney Pidgeon isnt the only one troubled by whats going on in Washington, D.C. Thousands of comments online continue to demand action to clear anomalies surrounding Obamas convoluted nativity story! Pidgeon told radio listeners that There is a tsunami of evidence that the man that sits in the White House is not who he says he is.
A sad commentary is the fact that during my lifetime this nation has elected 13 presidents (Ford, of course, doesn't count (for much of anything), and only one was a winner: REAGAN.
This piece of lying trash currently occupying the White Hut is the poorest excuse for a leader in world history.
The Supreme Court will not take it up. End of story.
Pelosi and Ried sigend the document of legitimacy. Would love to see them in Orange jumpsuits and in a cell next to all thier friends
On January 20, 2009, a few hundred men, women, and children gathered under trees in the twilight at Kobama, a village on the shores of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. Barack Obamas rise to the American presidency had captivated people around the world, but members of this gathering took a special pride in the swearing in of Americas first black president, for they were all Obamas, all the presidents direct African family.
Ping for later reading.
And I know you're not implying Ford was a winner, either.
One conservative. One winner.
I don't know what is so hard to understand.
And that is where the real tragedy lies.
“Pictures of Barack Obama are surfacing on a scholarly research site”........have been scrubbed. (page not found)
IIRC, the SCOTUS rejected an appeal to strike 200,000 phony signatures (gathered by ACORN) from the election roles in Ohio before the 2008 election. Ironically, Zero won Ohio by around 200,000 ‘votes’. SCOTUS is complicit in this Obamanation.
I read something interesting, no idea the validity of it, but it was mentioned that George Soros threatened to take down the world economy if this was ever revealed, is it possible that a cover-up took place to prevent that?
Infamous tribe of mau mau.
Did they rule on this, or refuse to take the case? If they gave a ruling, what was their reasoning? We need a long-term strategy to take the country back.
I believe you’ve hit the nail on the head.
Oh, they understand just fine.
Conservatism obviously offers the best, most effective means to govern this nation. We assume politicians (of both parties) want whats best for the nation as a whole rather than whats best for themselves as politicians, bureaucrats and lawyers.
We assume wrong. Its that simple.
Obviously something is not right here.
I do not know if all those who would need to be involved in this were complicit from the beginning or covered up after the fact so they didn’t appear as incompetent as they are.
Of course, “need to be involved” is relative. At some levels below the very top of this, involved probably means simply going along, for whatever reason.
We see this even down to the lowest level of conservative bloggers locally, banning any such discussion and anyone who brings the topic up. Of course, they did the same poor job of vetting this man as almost everyone did.
I think the real question is one not being asked.
Obama’s mother and his maternal grandfather (the “furniture salesman”) were wholly owned properties of the CIA, and there are strong indications that Obama was raised to be a deep cover Cold Warrior, possibly in the corridors of power in the Soviet Union.
In other words, he is an artificial man. This explains is erased background, multiple SSNs, etc., as well as his association with leftists with impeccable credentials, who unlike all their peers who were imprisoned or killed, are still around and untouched by what they did.
The US military has had several generals become US presidents, but the CIA only two, H.W. Bush, its former director, and Barack Obama, who was supposed to be a field operative, but lost his “mission purpose” at the end of the Cold War.
Thus what the public needs to know, more than anything else, is what section of the CIA raised and was to control him, and was he “retired” from his purpose, or is he still regarded as performing an active role for that agency, as an elected politician?
The more we learn of the CIA the more it resembles a left-wing think tank.
Even if it were to come out in FULL disclosure, it wouldn’t make any difference.
Those that support Obama would probably think it was a good thing and the Media would simply whitewash it as they have whitewashed everything else that has ever come out about this guy.
The Supreme Court and the Republican party is filled with cowards, so they wouldn’t do anything about it.
So, even if the truth were to come out that Obama was ineligible, I honestly don’t think it would matter.
Liberals, those in the Media, Academics and those with that entitlement mentality don’t give a hoot about the rule of law.
Hummmm... I thought they were just good little Communists, like their friend & neighbor Mr. Davis.)
What you mean is "end of providing proof that one meets the eligibility requirements to become President".
We now live in a nation where one is "American UNTIL proven otherwise".
“The Supreme Court will not take it up. End of story.”

You are correct. Further, they are planting disinformation as they work the internet. There is no doubt this has been going on for quite some time, and certainly before he began campaigning for the Presidency.
I'm also informed that in preparation for the Presidency, representatives were sent to Indonesia where all records about him were collected and destroyed or scrubbed, with appropriate fees paid.
SCOTUS, front and center, time for you to commit treason once more. Comeon, you know you love doing it.
A fairly recent picture.

I prefer the Romanian solution over to orange jumpsuits. Much cheaper too.
The Obots not merely told us all that; they clearly believed it. Part of what made them so odiously obnoxious was their tiny-minded stupidity in repeating like a squadron of trained parrots ‘The COLB is all there is and all there ever will be. If birfers weren't so ignorant and racist, they too would figure out this simple fact’.
Why on earth didn't we raise more Cain when they turned on a dime after the release of a supposed original LF BC????? These IQ-challenged Obots swore no such doc existed. They swore it again and again. Not one—not even one semi-intelligent semi-autonomous thinker—admitted to being one-hundred percent stupidly, gullibly, stinkingly ***wrong***. Instead, they trumpeted the brand new doc as yet more proof that Obama is legit.
These Obots are too dense for words. No, they aren't smart enough to figure out they've been played. Rather, every time something happens to upset their Moonbat Talking Points, they simply hop aboard the new meme like good little trained rats (hoping for a food pellet). I even read one Obot discoursing on what it “cost” Obama to stoop so low as to release the ‘LF BC’. In this worshipper’s mind Obama is some noble, lofty figure hounded by ignorant racists. He finally capitulated, but at deep personal cost. Not even Stalin's worshippers had it over on this guy. He and his ilk are mentally ill to a freakish degree.
I haven't met a really smart Obot yet. All I've met are self-lobotomized ideologues who believe whatever Obama tells them to believe. I'm sure they believe Obama’s father fought in WWII. Obama said so, right? They believe Obama’s parents met at Selma. They probably believe Obama, left to his own devices, uses proper English. The myriad examples of his sub-proper usage must somehow be concocted by wingnut racists. After all, a Harvard Man would have some mastery of at least the most basic grammatical principles...right?
I can't get my mind around how stupid a person would have to be to believe Obama’s ‘LF BC’ is the real deal. I just can't do it. I can comprehend people like Soros, who know Obama is a fraud and who use it to their full advantage--while laughing at everyone else. That makes perfect sense. The flying monkeys I can't understand. It's to the point where they'd have to wake up each day and swallow a whole bottle of stupid pills, to believe Obama’s nativity tale/tales. I guess they're just so enamored of this trim, hip uber-leftist, they consider their brains a small sacrifice to make. I don't get it but Obots are real, so there must be some explanation somewhere.
Hasn't he pretty much already done that?
“The First Time I Heard of Barack - Tom Fife”
****************************************************
THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS ARTICLE!!!!
*******************************************************
This information has been hidden by the media.... I first read this in Jan. 2009
Tom Fife was a physicist with top Government Security...... He debriefed the Government with his information in the 1990’s; but, it was dismissed!!
He tried to get someone to listen to him during the 2008 campaign when he realized that Obama was the same man this Russian ambassador’s wife had mentioned to him in the 1990’s.
On ......election day evening...... he finally was intervied by a radio personality who allowed him to tell this story.
The information was picked up by Bloggers but not the MEDIA!!
IT IS TIME TO LISTEN TO TOM FIFE!!
What is the penalty you ask? Look around you... We’re paying it.
If the Supreme Court will not take up this issue, then certainly the Mainstreme Media will report on the story soon.
Slightly off topic (but not too far), it’s always bothered me that Chief Justice Roberts messed up when administering Obama the oath of office at his inauguration, and then he was later “sworn in” privately. I can’t help thinking that was by design — you would think Justice Roberts would have known better — and wonder whether Obama truly, legally, legitimately took the oath of office. I never heard this investigated or even brought up after the fact.
Obots can’t dare entertain truth or their entire fantasy world will crumble before their very eyes. I swear it takes so much more faith to believe in Obama’s lies than it does to believe in God. So they continue on. Pathetic.

Both Intel and AMD face a non-desktop centered world in which power consumption and not speed is the prime requirement.
My cheap ($100) COBY tablet is an amazing device. It runs android, but people are trying to port Ubuntu linux to it. A friend who broke his screen is using it as a desktop with keyboard, mouse, and a usb hub. Amazing.
Are you kidding. I love the IPad except for the fact that it is so cumbersom to have to work through ITunes. Just think how nice it would be to have an extension of your desktop with you all the time and easily transfer files and programs from one to the other.

in_place_editingplugin, but my form setup was just too complex for it to work. (From doing some reading up online, the plugin also has some other issues and hasn't been maintained. Because of this there are several alternative plugins out there.) But I eventually wound up finding a solution I could adapt and use.
So after implementing that, simple in-place editing worked beautifully! Unfortunately, simple in-place editing isn't quite enough for my app. When a page item is updated, sometimes I need it to update another item on the page. The script.aculo.us Ajax.InPlaceEditor is only designed to update one page item--the one that was edited. I tried working around it by changing something like this (in my controller action where I handled the AJAX call):
render :text => new_value
To something like this:
render :update do |page|
page.replace_html(original_page_id_to_update, :text => new_quantity)
page.replace_html(secondary_page_id_to_update, :text => new_value)
end
That didn't quite work. It updated the
secondary_page_id_to_updateelement correctly, but instead of putting
new_quantityinto
original_page_id_to_update, it put in something like this:
try { Element.update("original_page_id_to_update", new_quantity); Element.update("secondary_page_id_to_update", new_value); } catch (e) { alert('RJS error:\n\n' + e.toString()); alert('Element.update(\"original_page_id_to_update\", new_quantity);\nElement.update(\"secondary_page_id_to_update\", new_value);'); throw e }
I was stumped on this for quite a while. Spent a lot of time scouring The Google for answers, digging into the script.aculo.us documentation for Ajax.InPlaceEditor, and examining the actual Ajax.InPlaceEditor code. What my web searches turned up was that I'm not the only person with this problem--I found several forum posts on different sites from people trying to do the same, or similar, things. Unfortunately, none of them had a solution. :(
So I went for a run to take a break, then came home to take a shower and like Archimedes, I had a "Eureka!" moment. (Though his was in the bath.) I realized what was happening was that both of my
replace_htmlcalls were actually working, but as part of what Ajax.InPlaceEditor does it returns the final value of the
rendercall, and sticks it into the field that was edited. This is just the default behavior, as it assumes you only want to update that one field.
Looking into the Ajax.InPlaceEditor code, I found this (relevant lines in bold):
handleFormSubmission: function(e) {
var form = this._form;
var value = $F(this._controls.editor);
this.prepareSubmission();
var params = this.options.callback(form, value) || '';
if (Object.isString(params))
params = params.toQueryParams();
params.editorId = this.element.id;
if (this.options.htmlResponse) {
var options = Object.extend({ evalScripts: true }, this.options.ajaxOptions);
Object.extend(options, {
parameters: params,
onComplete: this._boundWrapperHandler,
onFailure: this._boundFailureHandler
});
new Ajax.Updater({ success: this.element }, this.url, options);
} else {
var options = Object.extend({ method: 'get' }, this.options.ajaxOptions);
Object.extend(options, {
parameters: params,
onComplete: this._boundWrapperHandler,
onFailure: this._boundFailureHandler
});
new Ajax.Request(this.url, options);
}
if (e) Event.stop(e);
}
What was happening was that it was creating a new Ajax.Updater, which is meant to update a single element with the return value from the url it calls, which turned out to be that chunk of Javascript above when I used the
render :updateblock. The Javascript was being eval'd correctly, and updating both my fields, but then Ajax.Updater was re-updating the 1st field with the result of the
renderblock, which was that chunk of Javascript. (BTW, I think this Rails bug is the same thing, but they didn't see that anything was being eval'd because they only had the one field being updated, so their guess was that the eval was failing.)
I tweaked the Ajax.InPlaceEditor code to replace the Ajax.Updater line with the Ajax.Request line, and suddenly everything worked! But that didn't seem like the right solution, so I looked at the logic in that block. It checks
options.htmlResponse, so I tried setting
:htmlResponseto
falsewhere I set up the Ajax.InPlaceEditor, and voila! It worked.
So hopefully this will be useful to people, and turns out to be very easy. Here's the summary:
- Use a
render :updateblock with as many
replace_htmlcalls as you need (including one to update the in-place edit field itself).
- Set
:htmlResponseto
falsewhen you set up your Ajax.InPlaceEditor.
And that's it!

Thank you for posting this! I was using the same updated in_pace_editor, and knew there was some way to make it stop trying to update the field, but your post was the first to solve the problem - just threw :htmlResponse => "false" into the :ajax section of the editable_content. Thanks!
Great, glad it was useful!

Topic: Not for "public" consumption, but for you guys :D
Not for the mass public, but this was a more streamlined way to show if off to a bunch of my friends.
I was lucky enough to be able to get nice high quality versions of just about all the shots that I worked on for last years, well this years if your in Europe & the UK, The Muppets. And with the breakdowns that I had access to I put together a showcase piece that shows off my work.
This is long, 8+ minutes, so not really for a "this is the kind of things that I've done" reel, more for a "these are the Muppets shots that I got to work on" piece.
Hope you enjoy.

I love EVERYTHING about these photographs! The CL shoes are perfection, and the Dior dress and lace top are exquisite!! I want them all. I would dress like this every day of my life if I could ♥

Donald S. Clark
Office of the Secretary
Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20580
Dear Mr. Clark:
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Federal Trade Commissions request
for comments concerning competition policy and business-to-business electronic
marketplaces.
Ernst & Young is a global leader in providing auditing, tax and advisory services
through our 77,000 people in more than 130 countries. Among those services we provide our
clients with fresh perspectives on operating successfully in the new economy and a
comprehensive suite of solutions to established and emerging business-to-business
electronic marketplaces ("eMarkets"). Ernst & Young understands the unique
issues and complexities associated with developing and maintaining eMarkets, and can offer
an objective point of view on how eMarkets and their stakeholders (i.e., owners,
participants, the public and regulators) can best address competition issues and related
issues of trust.
The potential benefits of proposed eMarkets are significant. They promise to provide
the opportunity for businesses to leverage technology and make dramatic leaps in improving
operational efficiency and effectiveness. While we cannot comment directly on the
potential for abuse of competitive market practices, we can comment on eMarket
stakeholders concerns and how to build confidence in eMarket practices. Broadly,
stakeholder concerns range from inadequate systems and internal controls, insufficient
security, and potential commingling of data, to concerns that eMarket owners may overtly
act in an anti-competitive manner. For example, eMarket participants do not want their
competitors to have access to their client lists, pricing information,
customer-satisfaction levels, and purchasing trends and habits. eMarkets need to establish
trust with their participants and the public stakeholders. Failure of an eMarket to be
viewed as a trusted, secure and impartial marketplace could raise stakeholders
concerns and result in reduced levels of participation and the ability to maintain
long-term viability.
To address these concerns, nascent industry self-regulatory activities are being
undertaken by the eMarkets in conjunction with the eMarket owners, participants and other
various stakeholders. These activities include formally publishing entity security and
confidentiality policies and obtaining various "seals" of approval. It is our
belief, however, that self regulation by the eMarkets would be facilitated by the adoption
of a more comprehensive and robust self-regulatory framework. This framework should
include the development and acceptance of standards that have been subjected to public due
process and, importantly, verification of adherence to those standards by an independent,
third party assurance provider.
Comprehensive standards should address the concerns of the stakeholders related to the
eMarkets business model and operations. Following are some of those concerns:
Neutrality,
Confidentiality,
Security,
Availability, and
Transparency.
Neutrality,
Confidentiality,
Security,
Availability, and
Transparency.
Comprehensive standards are necessary to increase stakeholder understanding of the
nature of eMarkets and to ensure consistent application of the standards and
accountability by the eMarkets. For example, today, eMarkets employ varied policies for
confidentiality and security of eMarket information that may not clearly articulate to
stakeholders the access others have to their data. Consistent industry-wide standards
would provide an avenue to remedy this confusion and provide a platform to obtain public
confidence in eMarket practices. Because such standards would necessarily need to
reconcile the conflicting needs of various stakeholders (i.e., balancing the need to limit
the sharing of competitive information against the desire to promote information-based
efficiencies), we believe that the FTC could play a role in fostering the development of
these comprehensive standards.
Moreover, our experience tells us that stakeholders will desire assurance that eMarket
participants actions follow the comprehensive standards. We believe that significant
value is realized when assurance is provided by an independent third party that actively
tests to ensure that the eMarkets "do what they say they are doing." If
standards are not complied with, the independent attestation report is withdrawn. In this
way, trust is built by the eMarket and the positive benefits of dramatic efficiency and
effectiveness are realized.
We would be pleased to discuss our comments and recommendations with
the members of your staff.
Sincerely,
Ernst & Young

Infomercial marketers Wellquest International, Inc. and Tony Hoffman Productions, Inc. (THPI) and others have agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that they made false and unsubstantiated claims for three products - Bloussant, sold for breast enhancement; EnerX, sold for men's virility, and D-Snore, sold to relieve snoring - in violation of the FTC Act. The defendants also have agreed to settle charges that they made misrepresentations and failed to disclose material terms in connection with third-party buying club memberships they "upsold" to consumers after the consumers agreed to purchase Wellquest's products. The proposed settlement requires the defendants to pay $3.2 million in consumer redress and to possess scientific substantiation before making certain claims about dietary supplements, foods, drugs, or cosmetics. The settlement also requires the defendants to comply with the FTC's newly amended Telemarketing Sales Rule.
"Marketers must have rigorous scientific substantiation for the claims they make," said Howard Beales, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. "In this case, the claims were inflated, but the science just wasn't there.".
According to the complaint, the defendants' ads state that Bloussant stimulates breast cells to regenerate the growth process, thereby increasing breast size by two cups in most women. The FTC alleges that these claims are unsubstantiated. Additionally, it alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that Bloussant is clinically proven to increase bust size in the majority of women, and is clinically proven to be safe. Bloussant was heavily marketed in magazines, such as Mademoiselle, Elle, and Allure, in monthly direct mailers, and through infomercials that ran on 30 major cable stations and numerous broadcast stations, as well as on the Internet. Consumers responding to these advertisements were directed to call a toll-free telephone number, where the telemarketers often reiterated the challenged claims. Bloussant cost $220 for a two-month supply and $574 for an eight-month supply.
The FTC also challenges claims made about EnerX, an herbal supplement promoted for male potency. The complaint alleges that the defendants' claims that EnerX is safe and lacking in side effects are deceptive because EnerX contains yohimbine, an ingredient known to increase blood pressure and to interact with other medications. A two-month supply of EnerX is sold for $109. EnerX was marketed through magazine and newspaper ads, commercials on approximately 50 cable television stations, direct-mail fliers, and the Internet.
The FTC complaint further challenges that the defendants, including expert endorser Dr. Mark.
The complaint contains two additional sets of allegations, relating to the defendants' marketing practices. It alleges that the defendants engaged in deceptive upselling practices by enrolling consumers in one or more third-party buying services without the consumers' consent. Upselling is soliciting consumers for additional products during the same telephone call after the consumers have provided credit cards to purchase the initially-offered product. According to the complaint, after consumers provided a credit card to purchase one of Wellquest's products, the telemarketer upsold the third-party buying services on a "no obligation" free trial basis. The defendants allegedly did not disclose adequately  Buchfuhrer order requires Dr. Mark Buchfuhrer to possess substantiation for future claims about D-Snore or any other dietary supplement, food, drug, device, cosmetic, or any service purporting to provide health, cosmetic or physical enhancement benefits. He also must make disclosures about sleep apnea in connection with future representations made in connection with the marketing of snoring products..

Comments:This change would emasculate the purpose of the rule by enabling marketers to exploit an especially obnoxious loophole. Although the existence of an "established business relationship" is countenanced, this is insufficient basis for a rule that would effectively alllow telemarketers to circumvent the purpose of the rule. Instead of protecting the public interest, this "safe harbor" enables telemarketers to abuse the role of the FTC as mediator between commercial interests and a private person's right to contemplate their navel in peace. This proposal completely perverts the purpose and policy of the original rule. I strongly object.

Naturally, John is faced with the death of his father Sherlock accompanies him to his hometown for the funeral. John is forced to come to terms with death, and feelings that he’s been fighting for far too long.
Because this fic utilizes several prominent tropes, including a drunken first kiss and being forced to share one bed, it reads as familiar and predictable. John’s strong emotional response to his father’s death is understandable, but slightly undermined in how the narrative voice frequently refers to both parents by first name. It creates a distance of sorts between John and his family. While Mrs Watson is written sweetly and quite well (I could see this version of his mother getting along with Mrs Hudson), Harry does not reach the same potential. As for John and Sherlock, there are moments of brilliance within their dialogue but these cannot be expected as the norm. To be succinct, the men are written from a safe, neutral foundation and never quite reach their own brilliance within this first-time narration.
I was initially drawn to the concept of this fic due to the slow reveal of Mr Watson’s death in the first chapter. It is clear that something is wrong, but the details are gradually provided. I looked forward to similar scenes later in the plot, but was disappointed. From a personal preference, heavy use of descriptors and descriptions is a turn off. This fic is guilty of relying on both crutches. Additionally, I noticed minor technical and content errors, which are most likely the result of this being the author’s first piece without a beta reader. With more of a subtle storyline, as the author concludes in her notes, this fic does not satisfy my wants for a fic but might please other readers!

“Horrible men can watch me masturbate from across the room and suffer.”
“Can horrible men try to convince you otherwise?”
“Horrible men can try.”
Okay so I’m absolutely in love with the back-and-forth banter between John and Sherlock here. It’s so playful and amusing and really a great reminder that sex isn’t just…sexy. It can be fun and lighthearted. The entire fic kept a smile on my face, because while it’s incredibly sexy (like whoa), it still keeps up the light tone and ugh I kind of just love this fic. It’s sweet and fluffy but still hot with a hint of mischief. And you should read it. Mature readers because porn! Beautiful, fun, adorable (yes it’s adorable shhh there are tickles) sexy times.

On New Years Eve, Sherlock drags John out in the rain to study the fireworks.
Just a short, fluffy little mini fic to counter any angst you may have gotten from other fics. And it is fluffy. Will definitely bring a giggly smile to your face and make you hug a pillow and squeal. I’d love art for the last bit, definitely. There are mentions of this being a post-reichenbach fic, but none that should put any damper on the fluff. For being a minific, I think it’s very well written and worth praise, so read it and flail.

Sherlock Holmes has a routine: take the Jubilee line train from Baker Street Station to Stratford Station and head to New Scotland Yard. Day in and day out, he repeats the routine and pays little mind to the masses of stories walking by him on two legs - until he meets the soldier.
I’m going to literally die from all this amazing fluff. It’s the cutest thing I’ve read all day!! This was based on Paperman which if you haven’t seen get on that!! Seriously it’s the cutest thing in the world and this is a perfect Sherlockian companion. I love that there is very little, almost no, dialogue. The short is silent so it was a good nod to that. I love the phone trick Sherlock pulls too! It was a cute way to replace the paper airplanes and a great reference to ASiP! I just loved this, it was so cute! The writing is beautiful, it has strong imagery without feeling heavy. Despite the fluff I thought this stayed reasonably in character, it wasn’t a romantic love at first sight reason that Sherlock kept chasing John but the puzzle! The game and mystery of John Watson. Maybe it’s a bit more…committed than Sherlock would actually be but I thought it was done very well. Overall my face hurts from smiling so hard at this one, if you loved that short you’ll love this fic!

The observations of an amnesiac murder witness force John to rethink his assumptions about Sherlock, himself, and the definition of love.
Meanwhile, a murderer is still on the loose …
I read this about a week or two ago so I probably can’t give you as detailed of a review as I usually do but here goes. I really really like this story! This one brings in an OC, a Jane Doe, and I am in love with her. She’s like an alternate version of Sherlock! They are both geniuses but she is better at manipulating people socially; She’s a bit softer around the edges than our favorite detective. One part I love love love is the fact that she took Mycroft up on his offer! I got such a giggle from that. What I loved most about this is Jane’s role in the development of a relationship between Sherlock and John and the way it slowly progresses. I like that this story was more about John finding out what he wanted in life and the friendships he makes rather than it totally being about a romantic relationship. Though I do admit that the way they admit their feelings was super cheesy and super adorable. I mean I really shouldn’t have liked that part as much as I did! So cheesy yet so wonderful! The writing and characterizations were very good and nothing stood out to me as being “bad”. Even though I can’t remember many little details this story overall did stick with me and the fact that I remember most of the story says a lot about how much I like it! It’s sort of funny to me that I’m telling you I can’t remember the details and Jane has amnesia in this haha.

Fawnlock catches John dancing, John tries to get Fawnlock to dance with him, in the end Fawnlock gets what he wants.
I want to kiss this story. I really like this Fawnlock because of how animal-like he is; some of the other stories I’ve read will describe him in the forest and doing literal animal things but here it’s the subtle animal characteristics that make a difference. Like the purring, rubbing himself in John’s clothes, his collection of things, belly rubs etc. With this story I knew he was a fawn not just a fawn version of Sherlock. That’s not to say this is a completely different character than Sherlock, he does have Sherlock characteristics and personality, but they are not the same person. Which, overall, I appreciated! I loved the bit of emotion from John, to see how he’s not entirely okay with being back from the war but I would love to see more. Maybe not in this story, but I would like to know how he’s coping with civilian life and Fawnlock in his life. Despite Fawnlock being the focus of this story I don’t want to lose sight of John’s feelings and thoughts. This story is so sweet and the domesticity of it makes my heart melt. I was giggling and smiling the entire time while reading it. The entire tone just really gives you that cozy, warm, sitting by a fireplace happy feeling. This story just really really made me happy.

No one has ever stayed with Sherlock for more than a month. At least, no human. Fortunately, John Watson isn’t about to let the little things - like biohazardous experiments and the constant threat of danger - get in the way of his friendship with a very special, very brilliant man like Sherlock Holmes.
I will be the first to admit that I have an unhealthy obsession with AUs (wing!fics in particular make me squeal in delight), so it shouldn’t be a surprise that I absolutely adored this fic. I loved how the author took the time to explain some of the mythology and back-story. So many times you get a wing!fic and the reasons behind the wings aren’t very well explained, but that is not the case here. John and Sherlock also felt surprisingly in character for who/what they are in this fic. The development between them was phenomenal, and built at just the right pace for me. The visuals in this story were fantastic as well; if I thought I could do a semi-decent job, I’d spend my next day off drawing fan-art for each and every chapter, particularly chapter five… Also, the additional pieces that turn this into a series are precious as well. Sherlock surrounded by ducklings just sounds freaking adorable. All-in-all, an enjoyable AU that I would love to read more about!

A young John Watson mourns his father’s death, and comes across something strange in the woods behind his house.
Another Fawnlock! This one is short and sweet and I love their first meeting. This time they meet as kids and they’re both so frightened, I just wanted to scoop them up and give them kisses on the cheek. This had excellent pacing for being so short, it didn’t feel rushed or like there were any spots focused on too much. It spread out very evenly. I do wish there was more though, this has so much potential to just stop here! One thing I would like to know about this one though is how Sherlock came to learn English, it’s just something that I’m curious about, but didn’t effect my reading. Overall just really heartwarming, I love how these two found each other when they needed someone the most.

Don't get drawn into the headline. By illegal gun, they don't mean a weapon that was used or intended to commit crimes, they mean an unlicensed one. Don't get drawn by the sub headline either:
A MAN who shot himself in the head had an array of illegal firearms, an inquest heard.By 'array', they mean three.
Both the Burnley coroner and a senior police detective expressed ‘serious concerns’ about how David Read came to be in possession of a Enfield .38 revolver, a Beretta handgun and a rifle.How on earth did this man get his hands on three unlicensed weapons?
He had acquired the guns after the death of his father-in law in 1987 and kept them at home ever since.Oh. Well that answers that one.
So he has kept them at home since 1987? Doesn't sound like much of a criminal to me.
Mr Read, 65, was found dead at his home in Cleveland Gardens, Burnley, by his daughter Andrea on August 26 last year.An old age pensioner with old guns in his attic. Still, under our current gun terrified nanny state, that still would have been enough to send him to prison for a very long time. Maybe even the rest of his life at that age. That's if he hadn't killed himself first.
The cause of death was given as a single gunshot wound to the head.If he had chosen to pipe his exhaust gasses into his car as a way out, this would never have made the papers.
Det Insp Dave Groombridge, said that the fact that unlicensed firearms were present was of ‘grave concern’ to the police.If that's the case, none of these 'unknown' guns should really be much of an issue for you, but of course you want to claim ownership of all the guns for yourselves. Can't even let people keep an heirloom. But it's this next statement that extracts the proverbial urine:
He added: [...] “The number of firearms held by people who may have chanced upon them during house clearances or keeping them as collectibles or heirlooms in unknown.
“Such weapons may not be intended for criminal activities their mere existence renders the holder extremely vulnerable and presents a danger to the public.Guns not intended for criminal use pose a danger to the public? Does that include all the legally held firearms, or just the unlicensed ones that aren't intended for criminal use?
And owning a gun makes the holder vulenrable? H.. How? Disarmed citizens are extremely vulnerable. Armed ones are not, but disarmed is exactly the way the government and police would like us to be. You keep trying to convince people that they will be vulnerable by owning a gun though, just because one old codger decided he wanted out and a gunshot to the head was the easiest way to do it.
“This case has tragically highlighted the dangers inherent with illegal possession of firearmsThe danger in this case being you may want to use it to take your own life. Ohh. Let's all be scared of guns.

Amon Tobin is one of the most outstanding DJs out there today. When the Brazilian was working on his latest piece, ISAM, he wanted to produce something truly amazing. And something amazing is an understatement.
Matthew Herbert - One Pig
Once a year Manchester plays host to some of the most amazing talent in the modern world. Future Everything is a yearly festival that brings together those that take the strange and represent it in unique ways. And this year has been no different. Matthew Herbert is an electronic artist who specialises in the usage of those sounds most of us forget. On 18th May he provided just that with his performance of One Pig at the Royal Northern College of Music.

Hey John,
In the last week, I’ve given lots of thought about your responsibility versus accountability post, and wondered how vocal we are about the ins and outs of our profession.
Frankly, there’s a whole list of things I’ve rather not be held accountable for, including but not limited to student attendance, adult comportment around students, and an education system that cares much more about its bottom line than its students most in need. Yet, I feel responsible for all those things because a) I came in with the ideal that I would help move the needle towards progress and b) I still believe it.
The optimist in me wants to believe everyone involved understands this dichotomy; the realist in me knows too many people in positions of power who ignore this purposely.
That’s why, at every chance I get, I remind people that one of the ways we’re going to push the profession forward is to take responsibility for their own advocacy as well. I do believe in a collective voice, so naturally, I love having a union (or in my case, unions), and their work matters now more than ever for us having a say in how teacher evaluation and contracts are formed.
However, in other spaces, I’ve found that, in the midst of trying to advocate “for teachers” or speaking on behalf of us, people completely neglect us and / or play to a similar power structure that their detractors do. They might think they’re speaking as part of a collective, but not quite. While people don’t always intend for this to happen, it’s hard for me as an advocate to sit there and wonder why teachers still get the fewest amount of seats (if at all) even in spaces that proffer us, physically or virtually.
Mike Klonsky said once that we might need to destroy the whole flippin’ table, and I tend to agree with him.
For, whenever only a couple of us feel responsible for the children we teach (and these tend to also get held accountable), those moments become part of our experience, moments no one can take away from us. We can speak collectively about our concerns, but we root it in the experiences we have as teachers on a daily basis.
Now that I mention it, I also don’t want to be held accountable for our honesty, but I’m well aware of my responsibility towards it.

Eddy turns another year older.
He was a cheat just like the rest of them, but the style in which he did it remains incomporable.
Not to mention his bikes are among my favourites.
Read all about him on Wikipedia.
It is said that Merckx was the best, but even Eddy was scared of someone. That someone was Gary Clively.
Sync also shares a birthday with Eddy.
Here's ye vnitage fyx for the day which includes the handover of one the GonzLab possesions,

In Canada many of the traditions to celebrate the birthday of your country are similar to Australian traditions; outdoor parties, BBQ's, and often accompanied by beer with friends.
Being winter here in Australia, this year we celebrated with a Canadian classic dinner offering. On the menu was French Canadian Shepherd's Pie. This is a easy dish that is super yummy. I remember having this for dinner numerous times, hot and cold and always served with a squeeze of Ketchup.

I have forgotten that the world is smiling
That my dreams don’t fit through any doorway
And my spirit shines brighter than the sun
I have forgotten what it is like to love
And have adopted cynicism as my coping mechanism
I have forgotten that strangers are open
And friends are available
That poetry is therapeutic
And that prayer is healing
The spark in my heart has dimmed to a flicker
Trauma now blankets my fears
And isolation is the only place I find solace
The sky is not weeping yet I see no sunshine
The path is clear
Yet I stand stagnant, stuck, still, uncertain
waiting for something that isn’t coming
I am lost in the translation of my own identity
I am not who I believed I was
And I am not who I wanted to be
But I am human, genuine, beautiful
Authentically confused
Uniquely disturbed
And daringly open to smiling again.
Writing again.
Living again.

How are your New Years resolutions going? We all make them—it’s part of the New Year’s tradition. We’re determined that this fresh New Year is the perfect time to resolve to do something that will leave us “better” or “different” than last year. The problem with resolutions is that they’re usually vague and end up abandoned by February or sooner.
So this year, instead of making New Year’s resolutions, try setting goals—goals that will strengthen the bonds with your grandchildren. The secret of success in fulfilling goals is more about setting them up and writing them down than willpower and determination. Sharing your goal with others, means you’re much more likely to accomplish it.
As a grandparent, you may set some goals for your relationship with your grandchild, but remember you need buy-in from the parents. Remember they are indispensable when it comes to having access to your grandchild. You may even want to sit down with your family and come up with some shared goals, for example, a three-generation family vacation or a family reunion.
When you write your goals, there’s a popular acronym for remembering the five essential qualities of a goal: SMART, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time Framed.
Specific
Nebulous wording makes goals confusing and overwhelming. Defeat sets in before you even start. Imagine that you say: “I will be a more involved grandmother.” There is no way to know if you reached this goal. But if you write, “I will send a letter to my granddaughter once a month,” or “Once a month I will learn one new song, story or game to teach my grandson,” then you will have a specific action that you must take each month and hold yourself accountable.
Measurable
There’s an old saying: “What gets measured gets done.” When you make your goal measurable, you’re able to see your progress. So instead of saying: “I’m going to spend more quality time with my grandson,” you could say: “I will take my grandson fishing six times this year” or “I will take my granddaughter to three new museums this year.” Goals also need to be meaningful to you. That just insures that the goal you’re setting is something you want to do and not something imposed by someone else. Ask your grandchildren if they’d like to set a goal that both of you could work on together like starting a collection.
Achievable
This doesn’t mean your goal is easy, but that you can have a good chance of accomplishing it, which again may mean getting buy-in from your grandchild’s parents. If your goal is to have your grandchild come for a sleepover, you’re obviously going to have to get permission from her parents. And that means establishing a trusting relationship with the parents from the very beginning. Sitting down with your adult children even before your grandchild is born and discussing your commitment as a grandparent creates a sense of trust and value in open communication that will be last a lifetime.
Realistic
Realistic also means that the actions associated with your goal are things that you can actually do. If your goal is to get together with your grandchildren every weekend and they’re involved in too many activities of their own, then you’ll either have to set your goal lower or find a way to observe or participate in their activities. If that’s not realistic, then think about another avenue for staying connected with your grandchildren. You could take a computer class to learn how to stay in touch through email. Focus on your strengths and interests and how you might be able to share those with your grandchildren.
Time Framed
Having a time limit will give your goals structure. If your goal is to establish an education fund for your grandchild, you need to figure out how much money you want to contribute and by when.
Setting goals is more than deciding what you want to do. It involves figuring out what you need to do to get where you want to go and how long it will take you to get there. Here are some general suggestions when setting goals:
- Get working on your goals right now while you’re motivated.
- Take small steps when making changes.
- Develop a ritual for reviewing and updating your goals.
- Look at them once a month to check your progress.
- Be flexible – expect that your plan can and will change.
- Recognize partial successes at every step along the way.
- Be a good listener and open to feedback about your goal.
As grandparents, we can expect to be around for more than three decades, according to U.S. life expectancy. Our relationships will evolve as we all grow older. By setting some goals to strengthen your relationships now, you will build the foundation for future bonds. So get SMART! Take out some paper and pencil and write down your goals for 2009.

Twelve Colonies of Kobol (D26)Talk0

The Twelve Colonies of Kobol were founded approximately 2,000 years ago when the Twelve Tribes of Humanity were expelled by the 'gods' from the Kobol.
Following their expulsion from Kobol, the Twelve Tribes came upon the Cyrannus star system, a fairly unique double-binary formation with enough habitable planets for each of the Twelve Tribes to settle on a different world in order to preserve their unique cultural idenities while they worked to rebuild in the wake of their exodus.

Session One
*When you walk into a room full of new people, who are all equally unfamiliar to each other, do you not smile at the other people? Don’t you make a little contact, like, hey, I see you, person…? It looks like we’ll be in this class together. See, I do. And most people give you a little something back, a little smile or a hello. But one lady didn’t. She left me hanging, a couple of times. And when that happens I get all sniffy inside, like, are we going to have a problem?
*We all go around and say our names and when our baby’s coming and where we’re having it and who’s our caregiver, and also we’re supposed to mention a non-baby-related passion of ours. Except for me and Dave, this is a room full of snowboarding gardeners. Like, to a one.
*….Oh, yeah. It looks like we are going to have a problem. When we went around and talked about ourselves, I said that we were going to have the baby at home. What I did NOT say was anything remotely to the effect of, “And anyone who doesn’t is a fucking SUCKER. Home births are for champions, hospitals are for PUSSIES, pussies!” A little later, Miss No-Smile-For-You is talking about what she wants for her birth, and she looks right at me with this dirty look and says, “…Home birth is right for SOME PEOPLE but not EVERYONE is going to want to do it that way.” Aw, snap. She told me!
*Break time is awkward! I can’t seem to smoothly get into a conversation with anybody except Dave. I alternate between hiding my face in the baby photos on the wall, and tentatively trying to open out my body language so as to welcome conversation. Nothing happens. First day of school sucks!
*The teacher, though, is great. More about her later.
*Towards the end of class, she leads us in a relaxation exercise and guided visualization. The thing is, as I’m one of the two farthest-along women in the class, getting into a comfortable position isn’t something that I can pull off very quickly. So by the time the relaxation part has started, I’m in this totally awkward whackjobber position that I just end up going with:
In the red circle it says, "My shoulder is above my ear."
I figure I’m going to miss the whole thing if I keep trying to get comfortable. The visualization part is great. I always thought the womb was this pitch-dark scene! Apparently not! Depending on how bright the room/the day is, there’s quite a rosy glow going on in there! Finn can see the shadow of our hands on my belly and whatnot! This detail makes me unaccountably delighted.
I’ll tell you about the second class later. The second class rocked it, and was also terrifying!

I've had a hard time in my baby class with people, I think I'm the youngest one there now the obvious youngest "graduate" this week. Everyone else seems to be best friends already. Maybe I'm not making eye contact or something, I'm just so shy!
I had no idea that the baby could see our hand's shadow, thank you so much for posting that. I love it!
I've always noticed that when i got to a new class ! Even with yoga, where you'd expect everyone to be zen , there is always a lady ( it's often women i must admit..) who looks at you like you're going to be able to do the hand stand and she won't and you'll make her feel like crap. But I am always smiling and it's hard not to take it personally. But people are just like that aren't they ?
and by the way... i am the one who is really scared of the hand stand even after years and years of yoga. but i don't care that the others can do it well !
It's so cool to hear all this baby news and info.
When it;s my turn in a few years, I'll be all prepared thanks to the tina blog !
Hugs
Geez! It was like Clown Class, full of really unpleasant and judgemental clowns. What was WRONG with those people! I would LOVE to be in your class- we could whine and giggle together!
I really loved our prenatal class last time, and our teacher too. It was a fun weekly date for us. Good times. :)
Can't wait to hear more!
RIGHT!
Get her name - I'm on my way!!!!
I had a crap group in my Childbirth Class too. I had a complicated pregnancy and everyone was treating me like I had some communicable disease. Only one guy (that's right, one half of one couple) would speak to us. I didn't go to my last class because I couldn't deal with a roomful of grinning pregnant ladies assuring themselves that pregnancy was FANTASTIC and that everything about pregnancy was FANTASTIC and nothing about pregnancy was anything but FANTASTIC.
Ugh. I wanted to throw things at them.
We went to our first birth class last Monday, number two is tonight. We started right in on the videos. Saw four births. One right up close and personal that had me cringing. I know I did it before, but it is still really overwhelming and that bulge, that INSANE bulge--eesh, it gives me shivers right now.
There are four couples in our birth class. One is taking a different birth class on Sunday nights and was telling the instructor (and the rest of us) how toned her Kegel muscles were--but perhaps that wasn't as odd as our instructor's unusual explanation of Kegels...in that she told us that when doing the Kegel exercise, we should try to imagine picking up a penny and pulling it way up and then lowering it back out slowly. I couldn't figure out how you would pick it up...right this instant (after a week of strange contemplation) it occurs to me that perhaps the penny must start standing on its edge.
Can't wait to hear about the second class...
that woman is a stupid cunt wad. i want to smack her silly. obviously, she has serious issues if she is taking you saying you are having a home birth personally. i mean jesus. of course it's not for everybody. what a stupid thing to say. and of course you didn't mean that when you SAID it because anyone who has ever spent 2 seconds with you knows that you haven't a condescending of presumptive bone in your body, let alone your tone of voice. she's projecting all sorts of shit on you. probably because you are further along and have a large belly. there is a larger surface to project onto. well, she sucks and i hate to say this but i feel sorry for her poor baby. it would be nice if you found fun, cool people in the class to share with but the most important thing is you and dave and finn. so just focus on the teacher and do your own thing. having a baby is such a personal thing and then everybody has all of these really strong opinions about it. i think that's why there are all of these egos flashing around and feelings getting so hurt surrounding it. it's a crazy thing. i can't wait to hear about the next class. and the ICE!! oh my gosh. please wave a finn for me.

Welcome to parenthood, unfortunately this gets carried right on into childrearing.....to breastfeed or not, immunize or not, co-sleep or not, pacifier or not, etc. etc. etc. etc.
We try to gather all the important information and make a decision. You must be a stupid and bad parent if you did not come up with the same conclusion as I did.
And the worst of it is that we women do it to each other! But that is a "whole nuther" class to take. My advice......follow your instincts, they are good!!!! and each child and set of parents are different, so what works for one child doesnt work for another. Gather your information, and listen to your instincts, not everyone elses! Even though we insist on giving you advice.
omg i'm reading this during a conf call and i snorted into the phone...the penny on its side, oh my.
tina, obviously the woman is jealous of you because you are cool and awesome, and also jealous of your groovy husband.
Yes, what La Ketch said.
Also, who knew about that rosy glow?!? What the heck? That sounds dreamy.
Ah, man, thanks for the support, everybody!
Things picked up dramatically at the next class, socially-wise. I'll go write about it now! But dang, you guys are great.

"Paul Morphy and the Evolution of Chess Theory"- discussion
I am starting this thread for a discussion of this book by Macon Shibut. Several people have indicated an
interest and have the book. My copy arrived today, and I will begin reading tonight.

Since you don't have the book, I will try to identify the game that we are discussing as we go along, so you
and others without the book can follow any discussion about the games and participate.
The first game is:
Morphy v de Riviere Paris 1863
Game #361 in this collection that can be played on line.
and the first of at least two Morphy v de Riviere 1863 games in the downloadable png collection at the
bottom of the page in this link.
Unfortunately there is no easy way to go to the correct game in either collection.
This is identifiable by the last move -- 64.c8

Reading and studying "PM and the Evolution of CT"
My strong preference is to work through the book systematically from the beginning.
That would mean focusing our first discussion on the "Introduction" (pp.3-4) and the first chapter of "Part I: Analysis," which is "Paul Morphy and the Play of Our Time." (7-33).
As James states above, the first game considered - and extensively analyzed - (9-15) is "Morphy-de Riviere." The second is "M-Lowenthal" [London, 1859], (16-25), and the third is "Lichtenhein-M" [New York 1857] (27-29). There follows a 5-pp supplement with commentaries and games of other players.
So I'm suggesting we all read pp. 3-15, and discuss the ideas/concepts there and then
the game analysis of M-dR. What do you all think of this general plan? Are there other
suggestions for how to proceed?
coopershawk
16-May-09, 15:57
A Plan
Clark, That plan works for me.
I think we should go slow for another day or two until some people who have ordered the book receive it.
But I don't see any reason not be begin now. I will post something late tomorrow.

PM and the Evolution of Chess Theory- Shibut
Ironbutterfly's plan works for me. We may need to change some things as we go, but it seems very doable.
I received my copy for Amazon.com today. I think I placed the order 3-4 days ago, no sales tax and no shipping costs. My copy is new and the total charge was $12.12. And I thought McDonalds was the one with deals. Listed price on the book is $16.95. I think someone cut a deal.
I'm not sure how we are going to approach the actual discussion of pp 3-15, but I guess our style will evolve through the chapters.
First of all, I am not a fan of Shibut's writing. Of course, I'm not a fan of Fenimore Coopers ("Last of the Mohicans"), either. Fo me, I have difficulty grasping what he's saying on first read and inevitably I comment, "what in the hell is saying." And I end up having to re-reading his paragraphs. The other criticism I have, and maybe you folks do too, is his use of abreviated notations. That drives me crazy. I like to see the little "x" for captures and the "+" for check. Anyway, I'll have to work through those issues.
I wouldn't say that Shibut's intent is to bash Paul Morphy, but it is quite evident he wants to "clear up" some Morphy myths and correct the reader's perspective. Anyway that's my take on the intro.
I played through Morphy v de Riviere, Paris 1863. Here's a link to the game
It makes it a lot easier than manually making the moves, especially with his abbreviated notations
(
I don't think anyone would have a problem with the statement that this game is clearly not a "best" for either player. I assume that it was not a blitz type game and the clock was not a factor. The game occurred during the Civil War, and to what extent that Paul's interest in the game was wanning, I don't know. But I don't think we can expect a masterpiece each time the master goes to his canvas or picks up his pen. I'm looking to see further arguements by Shibut on this.
On the game, itself, I was distracted by the Morphy "reknown" and was doing exactly what Shibut warned not to do. It will take a while for me to separate the "man form the position". But I did find something interesting- On 55. Qf7+ , would not 55.Qh7+ have netted de Riviere's bishop h1 for Morphy??
Anyway, these are my initial reactions. There is no way I'm going to talk this lengthy on next posts. Looking forward to see what others have to say.

9. h3
This move interested me so I spent a fair amount of time with it and Shibut's variations on 9.
I usually think of this as a wasted move and don't do it because it weakens the pawns in front of the location where I am likely to castle. But as Shibut says, it seems to work in this game, and it demonstrates that we can't play chess successfully by blindly following a set of theoretical tips. One of the great things about the game is the constantly shifting blend between tactical and strategic considerations.
I played through the whole game once quickly, and now I am studying it more carefully.
JohnClark, I think the move you are referring to is 56. Qf7+ not 55.
56.Qh7+ would win the Bishop, but it loses the pawn on g3 with check. Morphy might have considered that pawn and the tempo more important than the bishop in this circumstance. My guess is that Morphy liked his chances to win better by not giving up the initiative. I will look at it more closely when I get that far in the game.
And yes, the highly abbreviated notation is more difficult than it needs to be.
OFF TOPIC:
John, have you read Mark Twain's essay criticizing Cooper? It is incredibly funny.
johnclark
18-May-09, 14:38
56.Qf7+
It's probably true about keeping the initiative that PM opted for, but he takes a check with 58...Qe1+ *. I more inclined to think PM want to push his g pawn. Here's a probable position had PM opted for de Riviere's bishop:
56.Qh7+ Ka6 57.Qxh1 Qxb3+ 58.Kg4
I would have been very tempted to snatch balck's bishop.

Through 26. Ng1
Worked through Through 26. Ng1 tonight. A few comments.
There were a couple of moves by Morphy that left me puzzled until later when a purpose became apparent. For example:
10. Nde2
I was thinking 10.Nf3. But then after seeing his move, I understood that Morphy did not want to block the advance of the f pawn on his next move. 11.f4.
21.Nge2
This move was very counterintuitive for me. I wanted to bring more pieces closer to the King for his defense, instead of moving pieces away, and exposing him to an attack that appeared to be imminent. Then later I saw that because of 21. Nge2, white was able to play 24. g3 and drive the black Queen all the way back to her first rank, taking much of the steam out of Black's attack.
Be sure to go over Shibut's analysis of move 26 and the tactical manuever available if White moves 26.Nd5 and Black tries to take the pawn with Rxe6.
As I read the notes, it occurs to me that Shibut is primarily critical of the prior analysis of Soltis and the venerable Reinfeld. So far, more often than not, Shibut is defending Murphy against critical comments made in their prior analysis.

Macon Shibut (whoever he is) and PM
Well, I just finished working through the first 16 pages of Shibut's book, inc. the M-dR game.
Here are some of my thoughts:
1. I never heard of Shibut before getting this book. Normally a chess writer's ranking and exploits are trumpeted in his book, but not here. So I googled him, and here's some of what I found - a NM (National Master), which means that he acheived the USCF rating of 2200, even if he later fell below it. Good for a chess player, only ok for a chess writer. He is also 2-time VA state champion and since '91 the editor of the VA Chess Newsletter. (A friend of mine who is a GM told me once - for whatever it's worth -never to bother reading the analyses of anyone below GM.)
2. Like jc, I have trouble with his style. I'm not bothered by his leaving out the x for capture, it's the fact his language and style seems antiquated. I would have guessed the book was written 75 years ago, not 15+. Definitely not smooth and easy to read, at least for me. [As an aside, Cooper's style is heavy and ponderous too, but he wrote almost 200 years ago. Twain's essay on Cooper's Literary Offences [thanks for bringing that up, cj!!] is the funniest and one of the most brilliant literary criticisms I've ever read - it's one I still read occasionally and chuckle over - but he basically misses the point: Twain is a realist analyzing a romanticist; Cooper isn't at all interested in the factual kind of truth Twain is, but what he sees as a much deeper spiritual truth. But that's probably more fit for another thread...
]
3. Interesting discussion between jc and cj about taking/not taking the B. I would probably take it myself, but am not at all sure it's the best move, since it gives the opposing Q so much room, and possiblities for perpetual, etc. I also agree with you, james, about PM's h3 causing me to think a long time about how that strengthens or weakens the position. I probably do it too often, according to master play.
4. As usual, Alekhine's comments are spot on. I particularly like "he clearly pictured to himself in each separate instance just what the given position required..." That's a concept I've been trying to understand for years, and don't really yet.

Finished game. Read to p.16 comments
I enjoyed the game and annotation. I don't have a complaint about Shibut's use of language- just a difference of perspective I guess.
Couple of comments as a result of Chess Master 9000's analysis.
a. CM has black leading by small fractions of a pawn until 46.Bh1. At that point it gives white an advantage and that advantage is steadily increased through the rest of the game.
b. CM likes Black's moves at 40 and 41. Shibut gives both moves question marks.
c. CM agrees with Shibut's criticism of PM's move 26.Ng1.
To my mind, this was a good complex game in which PM took advantage of small positional errors by black.
Those errors cummulatively led to a win in the end game.
Ironbutterfly, Your GM friend is speaking from the perspective of a player much better than us. IMO Woodpushers like all of us here can learn a lot from an NM commenting on a Morphy game. Fred Reinfeld, who taught a generation of club players was not a GM, and neither is Silman, who I think of as Reinfeld's contemporary counterpart, but both are good teachers. I would not say Mr. Shibut is comparable to either Reinfeld or Silman as a teacher, but that is not really the avowed purpose of his book, so I am not critical of him on that basis.
On the subject of move 56-- after playing through the game more carefully, I think it likely that Morphy did not overlook the opportunity to capture the Bishop. I suspect that he decided on the spot that he was going to be able to queen the g pawn and didn't need to waste time taking the Bishop on h1.
It's interesting that in this game black's light square bishop had control of the long diagonal, a theoretically excellent strategic position; but the bishop was ultimately irrelevant to the outcome. In my experience there is a big difference between a bishop on h1 or a8 and a bishop on g2 or b7. The reduced mobility of the bishop on h1 or a8 looks like a small thing, but in practice it seems to make a big difference. The same is true for dark squared bishop on the other diagonal of course. Comments?

pp. 16-19
Played through the Lowenthal game to the end, and then spent additional times with moves 1 through 16. I like to play the Evans Gambit occasionally, and I need work on my end game. So this is a good game for me to study.
Shibut questions Morphy's moves 10 and 13. Chessmaster likes Shibut's choices better, but only by a very small margin, so small that the margin might go away or be reversed if I let the computer think about it longer. In any event this is another complex game that I am enjoying.

Moves 16 to 32.
To me the tactical sophistication of these players is awesome. I get a different insight into
the depth of their understanding when playing through the game on the computer program such as
Chessmaster. Sometimes after CM thinks about a move for 60 seconds and it evaluates a move not played
by Morphy or Lowenthal as then best by some small factor: BUT if you let the computer program continue
to run for another 15 minutes, or maybe even an hour, CM may switch its evaluation and prefer the move
actually played by Morphy or Lowenthal.
Some of the middle game moves either make or defend threats that I would never see, so the motive for
the move is hard to understand. That makes it a difficult game to analyze, even with help from CM and
Shibut's variations.

cascadejames is back!
It's time to pick up game #2.
I just noticed that Shibut does not include the famous "Queen Sacrifice game (Paulsen v Morphy, November 3, 1857, game 6, First American Chess Congress, New York City).

Enjoyed this material. Especially the annotation by Reti and the author's comments. I don't
have much to add to it. Went lightly through 31-33, since they are non-Morphy games. I will
take the author's point that there were other good chess players with similar ideas. Ready to
begin Anderssen-Morphy Paris 1858 p.34 next.

Can we go back to Lichtenhein-Morphy, NYC 1857?
Asking your indulgence, I would like to take a look at pp. 26-30. On a side note, I think this game was played at the First American Chess Congress, NYC 1857. Personally, I think the Congress was pivotal for Morphy's ascending onto the international stage. Granted, he was the favorite coming into the tournament. But his winning the tourney cast aside any doubts that he was other than a world class player. Secondly, and much more to our initial interest, pp. 26-30 sumarize Richard Reti's views on Morphy's reknowned development of his pieces with some critical comments by the author.
So I was wondering if we could take a look at the game, Shibut's summary of Reti's insights and Shibut's commentary? We might want to tackle "Reti's Logic Applied to Another Game", pp. 30-33.
I'll post my reation in a day or so.
Thanks,

pp 26-30
I found pages 26-30 intriguing for both the content and his thesis. As you know, these pages, and the ones that follow deal with tempo. Shibut calls to the readers attention via Richard Reti's words Morphy's superiority over his contemporaries in his undertanding of "open positions" and the need for developing pieces without delay. Shibut uses Reti's example of The Evan's Gambit to illustrate the differences in "pre-Morphy" development and Morphy's development, which we now see as natural (p26). I thought the illustration was very clear and pertinent.
Shibut then examines Lichtenhein v Morphy, New York 1857 (I think this was an actual tournament game at the First American Chess Congress as Morphy did meet Lichtenhein in the third section of the tournament) and discusses it in the perspective of development and tempo. I thought the discussion was well done. It includes a superior line to the Two Knights Defense/Max Lange Attack now found in the Scotch Gambit variation of the opening (p.27; white's 5th move). In the analysis, Shibult points out several times how Morphy never lost tempo in the development of his pieces where Lichtenhein did several times.
Now all this is good and well. And then Shibult drops his thesis gavel pronouncing that development was very well known prior to Morphy and Morphy's acclaim to development and the use of tempo is a "sort of blind idealism" that the next two chapters will attempt to set aside AND will reexamin Morphy's chess vis-a-vis that of Adolph Anderssen and Wilhelm Steinitz! That's when I practically fell out of my chair.
Our author is attempting to correct the Morphy idealism on the backs of Anderssen who lost 8-3 in 1858 to Morphy and Steinitz who never played Morphy, but barely beat Anderssen in 1866. So you can see my skepticism and what I will be watchful for.
On content
-"Rapid development in the open game". I never quite undestood open v closed games.
is an excellent article on the two. Rule of thumb, open games/positions are usually 1.e4 e5 openings whose lines do not obstruct bishops. Queens pawns openings that obstruct bishop movement fall into the closed category. Now I get it.
-Just because a line of play has an established name, does not mean it's the better play. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.e5 loses to 5.0-0! Excellent little paragraph.
-The analysis on tempo through the first 14 moves of the game is very good.
Well, these are my thoughts on these pages. What do you guys think? Am I totally off? Will go forward with Reti's Logic Applied to Another Game and the Anderssen and Pre-Morphy Chess.

Shibut's book: pp. 23-33
First, I'd like to elaborate on what jc suggests in his comments above. On p. 26 Shibut says:
"our modern understanding of Morphy's style derives from what Reti wrote in Modern Ideas in Chess and Masters of the Chessboard." I haven't found my copy of MIC, but Reti spends 20 pp. in MotC arguing the point about M being "the first great player to understand the nature and characteristics of the open positions and to elaborate adequate principles for their treatment." (27) Reti analyzes six of M's game in some detail to illustrate these points. Shibut's conclusion is that: "Reti decided that Morphy's 'secret' lay in a breakthrough appreciation for rapid development in the open game."
Second, don't miss the fact (I did the first time around) that the material on the Lichenhein-Morphy game [NY, 1857] on pp. 27-29 is RETI's analysis, not Shibut's! Though Shibut does, inexplicably add "in pace" to the next to last paragraph on p. 27, and omits a couple of capture signs.
Third, it seems to me that Shibut is guilty of just what he accuses Reti of - generalizing.
Like jc, I am skeptical of some of Shibut's judgmental conclusions: he doesn't convince me that Reti and Saidy and Heisman are mistaken in their "blind idealism" in suggesting that PM advanced and focused principles of developing open positions, for example.
What more are you guys thinking about this section?

Anderssen-Morphy Paris 1858 10th Match Game
pp 41-52
A marathon win for Anderssen, 77 moves. Part of a match. Material was nominally even at the
end of the game, but Morphy resigns after a pawn promotion for Anderssen becomes
inevitable. Fascinating game, Anderssen opens with 1. a3 and plays the game as a reverse
Sicilian. Anderssen controls the center and the game is initially very clogged up. Morphy never
seems to have enough space to operate, even into the end game.

Morphy-Anderssen Paris 1858 informal game
pp 61-63
Kings Gambit in which black (Anderssen) attempts to defend his extra pawn on f4, and gets
beatrn badly by Morphy in 19 moves. Interesting notes from Shibut, and a reference to a 1961
Bobby Fisher article titled "A bust of the King's Gambit." Both are very different games than
our consultation game with the same opening, but they both shed some light.

Playing as the Medic in Mann vs. Machine is odd as it quickly becomes apparent that the standard load out for the class is less useful than the unlockable weapons. This is especially the case for the medigun. Due to the tower defense aspects of the game play, survival isn’t the priority of the game at all, but doing damage in a defensive manner. For this reason the UberCharge, while useful is worse for MvM than another medigun. Both the Kritzkreig and the Quickfix have a faster heal rate than the standard medigun, and the kritzkreig’s crits are extremely helpful against the enemy machines. This isn’t to say that you should play Medic in MvM if you don’t have a better medigun, but if you do then use it.
Another strategy that you should be aware of while playing as Medic is who you should be healing. The usual, almost cliché choice of the Heavy might not be the best choice depending on the oncoming wave. In the first few waves you’ll want to heal someone who can do some damage to a lot of people quickly, so the Pyro would be a better choice. Against giants, someone doing a lot of accurate damage is best, like the Soldier or maybe the Sniper. Obviously this kind of thinking becomes more complicated.
A great benefit to playing as Medic is starting out with the passive regenerative health. As this is an upgrade I would normally buy anyways, it nice having this from the beginning to save some money. When buying upgrades you’ll want to fully round out the medigun. Try and buy more upgrades rather than the more expensive better ones. All of the upgrades for the medigun have weird prices, so you’ll want to watch your math to be able to get the most before each round.

While I agree with most of what you say, there’s just one thing I’d like to point out. The only reason you should be focus healing a Pyro is because either they’re dying, or you’re giving them overheal, not because they do damage.
Pyros should never, ever, EVER, upgrade damage on their Flamethrower. The reason Pyros are useful in MvM is due to their ability to airblast and either reset or stall the bomb – therefore, they should be adding airblast force/resistances/uber canteens/speed to help them survive as long as possible. If you upgrade everything the right way, you’ll have no excess money for +damage on your flamethrower.
Like my friends and I say, a Pyro can easily decide the outcome of a mission, and unlike some other classes, there really is no wiggle room in what a Pyro should be doing.

Minecraft – v1.4 Cool New Features for Gamers and Servers
The most exciting new feature coming for Minecraft might be that mobs can spawn with equipment and armor. These mobs might be wearing a complete set of diamond armor or just some leather boots. You’ll be going from running into a naked mob to one potentially dressed in full battle gear, even ones with enchanted weapons and heavy armor. It’s being reported around the internet that these mobs aren’t dropping any loot, apparently due to gameplay balancing issues.
If you enjoy trading within your Minecraft world, this element of the game will also be update. Villagers will be able to gather up their own feelings, meaning if you abuse them, they won’t give you the same deals when you decide to barter with them. If you give them plenty of love, they’ll want to trade more and even give you some specials along the way.
Getting back to baddies, in this update for Minecraft (v1.4) zombie raiders can actually metamorph villagers into zombies – ones that will actually retain the facial features of the original villager. Even the babies aren’t safe – they can become baby zombies! These villagers can actually be saved, but it’s a long process and one you probably will forgo in favor of just cutting them down.
For the Minecraft techies out there, this update will bring some goodies as well. There’s going to be something called the “Minecraft Control Block” which will allow you to execute server commands when executed by redstone. This way, you can do things like alterating the amount of experience or even alter the day/night settings. In addition, the modding API for servers will be included with this stack, so servers on their own can host mods which can be auto-downloaded by players as soon as they join the server. this makes playing on modded servers ridiculously easier and should help move more great mods around servers around the world.
Players should note that there were quite a few bug fixes in v1.3.2 and more should be on the way for v1.4 of Minecraft.
Stay tuned to Gaming Illustrated for the latest Minecraft news and information!

Fall 2011 has been an incredible season for gaming. Big name titles like Batman: Arkham City, Uncharted 3, and Skyrim have given previously successful games like Call of Duty a run for their money. While Modern Warfare 3 shows success once again in the financial side of the gaming industry, does it have any room to compete with the much more immersive games that have released this year? And by itself, does it out-perform its predecessors and define what a Call of Duty game truly should be?
The biggest disappointment I found when I opened up MW3 and popped in the disc, was its immediate similarity to MW2, the previous title in the Modern Warfare Series. The game runs on the EXACT SAME engine, with no improvements graphically or mechanically. With this said, the game quickly received criticism, being referred to as “MW2.5”, or “the new MW2 map pack.” While those statements are a bit harsh, the game doesn’t do much to defend itself from the attacks. Like Modern Warfare 2, you will load up a menu with 3 options: Special Ops, Campaign, and Multiplayer.
Upon starting the campaign, you will be given a very brief relapse of what happened in the previous two games (it won’t really bring you up to speed if you haven’t played them), and you are systematically thrown back into the fight, as a U.S operative named Frost. MW3’s campaign, as you might have guessed, is a direct continuation from MW2’s plot. In this installment, Makarov, the trilogy’s main antagonist, has single-handedly started WW3. You will not be playing as Frost for much of the game, as you will be bouncing back and forth between U.S, Europe, and even Africa, as different characters. With that said, you will also find out the fate of Captain Price and Soap, now wanted men thanks to the events of Modern Warfare 2.
The campaign is an explosive, fast-paced adventure that you should be familiar with if you’ve been following the series. I have found that the plot is just as satisfying as previous titles, and the ending is a good close to an exciting trilogy. While it doesn’t stack up to other stories from games I’ve experienced this year, the campaign is what I consider the best part of the MW3. The rest? Not so much.
Special Ops is the only part of the game that I saw any real improvement. Special Ops features a brand new mode this time around, called Survival, which is more or less a MW replacement of Nazi Zombies. You start off with a pistol, and must survive the onslaught of endless waves of enemies, by getting money from the kills and purchasing better equipment to defend yourself. Survival mode is fairly entertaining, and you can even grab a friend to join in too. I’m not the biggest fan of endless waves, but I can definitely see that with the right type of person this mode will satisfy for hours upon end. Both Survival and the familiar mission mode of Special Ops have a global leaderboard now, that compares your scores in these modes with everyone that plays Modern Warfare 3. You can also Find Matches with other players, simply by hitting the “Find Match” button, similar to the multiplayer.
Speaking of multiplayer, I hope you brought your camping gear, because MW3 offers some of the best campgrounds ever seen in the series. Seriously speaking, MW3’s multiplayer did a lot of things to fix the problems of MW2, but in the process created even more. A lot of the problem with MW2 was that the perks were very unbalanced, thus giving people extreme and cheap advantages if they make the right classes. Noob tubing, quick scoping, and scary fast commando pro players started running the scene, and it made the experience daunting, if not frustrating. MW3 killed two of those three birds, but let out an entire cage of pigeons in the process.
The number 1 problem I had with the multiplayer was the quickness of death. I have NEVER experienced a multiplayer where you die so fast, and this alone creates a plethora of problems. Because you die so fast, you can almost never escape a situation if someone has you in their sights. Why is this a problem? Because people, being normal human beings, are quite prone to finding the easiest ways to go about things. Quickness of death makes it easy to camp in a corner and wait for someone to run in your sights, because they really can’t do anything about it.
This ruins the experience for those who are trying to play the game like it’s supposed to be played. They added Support/Assault classes for a reason, to allow players to have an option to support their team instead of just mindless killing. But how can they go about this when they have to watch every single corner for an asshole who can’t just play the game like normal? Truth is, they can’t.
Another problem is the very poor collection of maps. These maps are by far the worst batch of recycled buildings ever put out by the series, because there are way too many openings and paths that people can take. Why is that bad? Because of what I stated earlier. Too many entry ways lead to less tactics and more hoping and praying, as well as camping.
Of course, it’s not just the many pathways, and illegitimate structure. The respawns certainly do not help at all. Now I haven’t played all the modes, but I think I’ve played enough of them to get the jist of the terrible respawn system. Like previous COD games, they never quite get a good respawn system, that spawns you in substantial and plausible locations that aren’t too far or too close to the enemy. However, this multiplayer seems to go a step backwards, as Black Ops was definitely a bit more fair. I can’t tell you the number of times I killed a guy, and then 10 seconds later, the same guy comes from behind me and kills me. It’s just awful, and makes me rethink playing the game.
Of course, a Call of Duty multiplayer can’t be a multiplayer without the insane amount of replay value. While I extremely dislike the multiplayer, I still for some reason, found myself playing it. I couldn’t play it for more than a half hour at a time, but the addictiveness remains. MW3 has probably the longest road to capping out your level, offering 80 levels of experience, and then 15 prestieges to climb. I find this amount of leveling to be ridiculous and unnecessary, especially considering the series busts out a new game every year. Activision even announced the next Call of Duty game one day after MW3 was released. That’s real incentive to play your multiplayer brah.
Many people were hoping that Modern Warfare 3 would be the game to revitalize the series as a whole, after the mediocrity of Black Ops and Modern Warfare 2. If you ask me, I think that this game puts the series in even worse of a position than before. We are only 5 days past the release of the game, and it already feels unbalanced. And let’s face it. The multiplayer is what the reputation of Call of Duty is based upon. When people think Call of Duty, they think of it’s multiplayer.
Despite all these things worth mentioning, Call of Duty was a financial success. It set a record for most sales in the first 24 hours, beating the previous record holder MW2 (no surprise), by 1.8 million sales. Is this enough to call it a great game? No, not in the slightest.
Call of Duty has an enormous fanbase, and their devotion resembles that of a cult. No matter how often they are pouring out $60 for a new Call of Duty game, they’ll do it almost out of a need to keep up with the series. To put it blatantly honest, the game is just a shadow compared to the many titles that have come out this year (Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3 are two different styles, so I do not compare them).
If you are any type of Call of Duty player, and are reading this review, you most likely already have the game, and are simply reading to reassure yourself. However, I will not be reassuring; the game is not worth the $60 price tag. I split the purchase with my brother, and still feel pretty ripped off. Call of Duty remains a party game at best, or for those who have a plethora of online friends that enjoy mediocrity. If you are thinking of picking this game up, I suggest you look towards the better games of this year, as they will give you a better experience than a game that is forced to duplicate itself every year without the slightest thought of innovation.

It’s a very long essay and shouldn’t be spoiled by using many excerpts. Besides, if you don’t read the whole thing, you miss the connections he makes to a more palatable future. In order to understand those connections you need to see his take on a previous grab for power by the elites.
In the course of arriving at his optimistic prediction, he shares some gob-smackingly amazing
For example, we have this to ponder, as Whiskey describes the mindset of the trans-national elites:
This model, that of a trans-national elite, taking steps to control the US Presidential election, does seem to describe what Obama’s campaign really is. There are other data points. San Francisco columnist Mark Morford describes Obama as a “Lightworker”, a near-parody of the WB series “Charmed” “White Lighter” characters..
Yep, these folks really believe that Philosopher-King Obama is going to help us to evolve into more soulful beings. I can’t wait.
- - - - - - - - -
Whiskey compares the rise of Obama-ist transnational elites to the rise of monarchies and the consequent taking by force the wealth of which monasteries were the repositories:
The Kings of Medieval Europe could not match the production of wealth that the Catholic Church’s Monasteries produced. The Kings could not produce the large amounts of educated, loyal to Rome, and absolutely required functionaries that the Church alone provided. But the Kings could create alliances to seize said Monasteries and distribute the wealth among themselves and barons, such as Henry the VIII. Or found universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, and the University of Paris, to create their own, loyal, literate functionaries. Because while the Monasteries were a huge source of wealth, they could not be defended. Defending the wealth required men under arms, something the Church was never able to produce.
So, Whiskey says, did Obama perform likewise, in creating alliances to gain power, though he sees a problem arising in O’s bypass of the large populist group in America:
In the same manner, the “Obama Model” of media in the tank, illegal foreign money (not reported by said in the tank media), voter fraud, and thug tactics has a weakness.
By moving entirely outside the media, through building grass-roots organizations, populists can control their message and use it create wedge politics, particularly through using nationalism and populism. This would include such things as various social events, private insurance, entertainment events, and so on. Particularly as the global economic crisis makes the ability of trans-national elites to provide welfare payoffs to broad slices of the electorate very questionable…
I don’t want to give away the rest of his argument. Go read it for yourselves and make your own judgment in the matter. I will leave you with this quote, though it is not his last word on the subject:
…It is a simple matter to show the intimidation and thugocracy of minority-oriented governments, be it an Obama thugocracy, or that of a Sarkozy, or Gordon Brown Sharia-compliant regime, and make the case that the majority, made second-class citizens or worse in their own nation, have no other alternative but the populists…
I prefer the term “Culturism” myself. As the author of the text on it says:
The words “multiculturalism” and “racism” undermine important policy discussions. “Culturism” can start them again.

State where you are, where you can go, and if you're offering or seeking transpo or lodging.
No digressions. Don't make a maniac out of me. Do digressions, tips, and chitty-chat in an open thread post I'll start now. Keep this clean of static. Just to match willing canvassers and phone-bankers with rides and beds.
An excellent idea. So why isn't the RNC doing something on a wide scale like this?
No, never mind. It doesn't matter anymore. The Aces will have to rebuild from scratch so I'm glad they're willing to do this now.
Later they will have the creds and moral muscle to rally others.
Let's face it: the GOP needs rebuilding from the trunk back to the tail. It is going to take people like Ace to get the energy flowing, never mind the logistics.
That is, if the Fairness Doctrine doesn't close him down before oh, say, 2010 or therabouts. If the Dems make their move on this, it will be in time to snuff the next round of campaigning two years from now.
Meanwhile, for our American readers, go over and see if there is any way for you to participate in this effort.
Great essay.
...finding and putting up candidates, who are Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan...
More importantly, these guys will have combat experience, which I suspect will prove useful in the coming crises.

I don't know what else to call them...the analogy is apt in my mind.
They are the intellectual construct by which I deal with the barrage of bad news from Baghdad. They work for me...I'm not sure how others do it...and I'll be honest: in the end, my fences are very, very selfish.
The fences come into play when I hear or read a news report that says "another soldier killed today".
I listen carefully. If the report says the tragedy took place in somewhere other than Baghdad...I am relieved...and all my fences are intact.
But if that report is from Baghdad...the bad news just breached the first of my fences.
And so I listen some more...I search the internet. I look for any clue. Sometimes the report will indicate the Soldier belonged to the 4th ID or the 82d Airborne. If so...my second fence remains solid.
But if the report says 1st Armored Division...my second fence has been breached, my fences...my defenses...are weakening.
I have other fences. Unlike most, I have the "female soldier" fence. I've noticed the press is likely to make special note if a casualty is female...or perhaps the story will refer to the soldier as "he".
If I can be reasonably sure it isn't a woman, the third fence has protected me.
Inside the 1st Armored Division I have the 1st Brigade, 2d Brigade and 3d Brigade fences. Inside the 1st Brigade I have five battalion fences.
Not quite as useful, but handy occasionally, are the Officer/NCO/Enlisted fence, the Quartermaster versus Infantry fence and the east-or-west-of-the-Tigris fence.
But the ugly little secret that we don't really talk about is that in the end, I have about 120,000 fences...in the end the fences are about protecting my Soldier.
I don't want any Soldier to die. But there are varying degrees of that - and they work in the inverse sequence of the fences.
First and foremost I'm concerned for my wife. Next, is for her soldiers...because she really is the sweetest woman on the planet I know how devastating it would be for her to lose one of hers. Beyond that, I pray for the 1st Brigade...because somehow I believe that every time that 1st Brigade fence is breached, it becomes just a bit weaker and doesn't protect quite as well.
These are my fences...I don't have to ensure they are rational.
I don't really like to look at my fences too closely. I like to pretend they are real and solid and offer true protection. But some days when I'm weak, if I look at them carefully, my fences look like the slot dividers on a huge roulette wheel. There may be thousands of slots on that wheel...but if they spin that little white ball it must come to rest somewhere.
I wonder sometimes about those who don't need fences...because they have no personal stake in this war. And I wonder how that feels.
I can't remember how that feels.
I was a child during the Vietnam era. As I learned to pray in the Southern Baptist church I learned that every prayer must include the phrase "and Lord, please bless our Soldiers in Vietnam". I suppose I had no personal stake in that one -although I was very aware when my big brother got his draft number - and it wasn't a particularly good one. But the example set in my church led me to feel as if I had a duty to pray for those Soldiers...as if somehow God had a huge scale and the weight of the prayers had to tip the balance in the Soldiers favor.
On the eve of Desert Storm I took my little brother to the airport. Ostensibly he was heading for a new unit in Germany but we had it figured out...soon after his arrival in Germany that unit would be shipping out for Iraq by way of Kuwait in a serious shooting war. I fought that war at "maximum standoff range". I was in Atlanta. He has sand in his boots, a Bronze Star medal on the wall, and demons that sometimes still call in the night.
I learned a couple of days ago that my neighbor, the guy whose front door is ten feet from my own, the guy with whom I had a beer and barbecue only a few weeks ago - he was wounded on Friday. He's been medivaced from Iraq to Germany and they are talking about flying him to the US. He has severe burns and needs skin grafts.
And my wife is in Baghdad. And many of my friends.
A dear friend of mine whose husband just concluded his R&R leave told me that while preparing breakfast this weekend she popped the seal on a can of Poppin' Fresh biscuits. He flinched. As she told the story I got the feeling that the flinch was almost more disturbing than if he had reacted in a greater way. As if all the evil and heartache and fear symbolized by a sudden, quick sharp noise has insidiously taken up an unshakable residence deep inside his soul.
So I don't know - indeed I'm not sure I ever knew how it feels not to have a personal stake in a very dangerous endeavor.
Without that stake, is all this just something happening "over there"? If one has no personal stake...is that what allows some politicians to use this all as their political football, posturing for the pithy sound bites and the provocative headlines...and votes.
I don't know. I don't know how it feels. Perhaps it is an exhilaration that one needs no fences of one's own. Or perhaps it feels like liberty...the sweetness of which can only be tasted in its absence.
Or is it sweet? I don't know.
History is being made and we are on the right side of it. Of that I am not in doubt. And I have a personal stake in that. Virtually everyone of us living here in Giessen and Friedberg, in too small apartments shopping at too small commissaries and tiny little PXs...getting together for frank discussions of our fears over lunch...opening our hearts to our neighbors to fullfill the palpable need for human contact and understanding...virtually everyone of us has a personal stake in the liberty of 25 million Iraqis...and possibly the peaceful future of the world's most troublesome region.
I have a stake. I own a piece of that. And I am proud that I do. I am proud of my wife for her sense of duty to her country and to her Soldiers. I don't mean some jingoistic sort of arrogance sort of proud. I mean being a part of something that is greater than one's self. I mean having a speaking part in a role that is noble.
And I wonder what it feels like to have never held the fickle hand of a noble calling. Do the concepts of duty, honor and sacrifice hold any meaning for those? I don't know. Does knowing that one will bear no cost balance with one's lack of investment?
For I don't know...until the bill is delivered... the price that will be required of me for my personal stake in history. None of the stakeholders do.
And so I build my fences. I build as many as I can...as strong as I can. I bolster them with prayers and scripture and bravado and probability and sometimes too many glasses of wine.
I vent my anger to strangers on the Internet and my hopes to that tiny inner circle of the truest of friends.
I build my fences and polish them with optimism. I hiss loudly at tresspassers who would cheapen the value of my investment. Stay away from my stake! Don't stain it with your fingerprints...I don't know what it cost me yet!
My fences keep me sane.

Scandal alert: Barack Obama has been complicit with rappers since at least 2006! He has collaborated with their nefarious aims! It's all there in a sordid report from Human Events, which lays bare the undeniable ties between Obama and individuals who have released albums containing rap music at one time or another. He hasn't rebuked them or repudiated them or even renounced them! Not even "foul-mouthed rappers" like Will.I.Am! Not even when, throughout the rap industry, "folks talk so openly and regularly about b———, n——— and hoes"! Yo Evan Gahr of Human Events, can you please drop some knowledge on these muhfuckas?, 'ight let a n—— rock. Cause we 'bout to eat real s—-, not s—- slop."
Further research indicated that those weren't even in proper sonnet form! And that Q-tip is black!
Obama thus far has equivocated on rappers. He has criticized their language, but adamantly refused to denounce the whole sordid genre as the unique cultural problem that it is.
He refused to denounce De La Soul's 3 Feet High And Rising even after it was pointed out that one of the group's members has been photographed in baggy jeans!.
All confirmed rappers. Except Russell Simmons. Coincidence?———?"
Ludacris and Obama both like b———!
Evan Gahr, shut your bitch ass up, hoe bag!

Remember Susan Burns, the woman "from the American CIA" who in April tried to beat up a Gauguin hung at the National Gallery of Art? Well, she got back inside the gallery somehow, and this time allegedly went nuts on a Matisse.
Court documents posted by The Smoking Gun say that on August 5, Burns walked up to "The Plumed Hat," then "grabbed both sides of the frame holding said painting and slammed the painting against the wall three times, damaging the antique original frame of the painting valued in excess of $250." The painting itself is worth $2.5 million— a lot less than "Two Tahitian Women," the $80 million Gauguin that Burns tried to destroy earlier this year. At least she's becoming price-conscious.
You might not be surprised to learn that in the wake of Burns' first art attack, she wasn't supposed to be in the museum. She even signed paperwork barring her from the gallery and grounds. Because she allegedly violated her agreement with the government, she's being charged with unlawful entry and contempt of court, in addition to felony destruction of government property. She's also supposed to be transferred to St. Elizabeth's hospital to be "monitored closely."
Given that the Gauguin depicts two women standing around with their boobs hanging out, it almost sort of makes sense that Burns would regard such artwork as "evil" and "homosexual" and want to destroy it. But there's nothing overtly homosexual or naked about the Matisse—it's just a portrait of some chick in a hat. Maybe Burns harbors prejudice against the French? She probably still uses "Freedom Fries."

Bad news for West Coast junkies (is there really any other kind of news for junkies?): Two cases of suspected botulism in Seattle have been blamed on tainted black tar heroin, in addition to four recently in Texas, according to the Los Angeles Times. It's especially bad because the only real way to find out your stash is tainted is to contract botulism!
.
According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, symptoms of botulism include "Breathing difficulty that may lead to respiratory failure, difficulty swallowing and speaking, double vision, nausea, vomiting, weakness with paralysis (equal on both sides of the body)" and more. Add those to the general shittiness that comes with being a junkie and, well, the heroin scene just got a lot worse.

Actor and profesional crazy person Charlie Sheen recently hosted the opening of his new bar in the El Ganzo hotel in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, was on hand to watch Slash perform. What a party!
Too bad Sheen ruined the night with a homophobic slur.
When greeting the crowd, Sheen asked, "How we doing?...Lying bunch of faggot assholes, how we doing?"
Sheen quickly gave a two bullet-pointed apology to TMZ:
1. "I meant no ill will and intended to hurt no one and I apologize if I offended anyone."
2. "I meant to say maggot but I have a lisp."
A lisp you say, dear Charlie? Well let's take a look at some quotes from Sheen's 2011 public meltdown and see if he really can't pronounce that "ma" sound that's in the word "maggots":
- "I'm tired of pretending I'm not a total bitchin' rock star from Mars."
- "If you borrowed my brain for five seconds, you'd be like, ‘Dude! Can't handle it, unplug this bastard!' "It fires in a way that's maybe not from, uh… this terrestrial realm."
- "Look what I'm dealing with, man, I'm dealing with fools and trolls."
- "I'm sorry man, I got magic and I've got poetry in my fingertips, you know, most of the time, and this includes naps."
Charlie, it's safe to say that you can say that word, and other crazy dumb things, just fine after all, ya maggot.

The President of Uganda-, he has spoken out about homosexuals in
It is not the first time he has spoken.
In 1999, he famously ordered the Criminal Investigation Department to look for us and arrest us. It was a quite popular pronouncement, except that it did not go down well with some of his Western friends. They told him that it did not square with their idea of human rights. And he had to walk back the pronouncement. Not in
With the recent gay bashing, he has not been very vocal. Nsaba-Buturo and others members of his cabinet have been doing the job. But he came out and spoke, urging lawyers…
Here are his words, as quoted in the New Vision.
The President further observed that African culture was under threat from Western influence. He advised lawyers to research on African jurisprudence, addressing issues that had been left out by the adopted Western legal systems.
“There are some Western things that we cannot accept, for example homosexuality,” he noted.
“Europeans are saying it is a right and we are saying it is a deviation. You don’t kill them, but you know it is abnormal. But the Europeans come and say it is an alternative way of life,” Museveni added.
Interesting take on the issue. No. He doesn’t want us killed.
It does seem like a concession, doesn’t it? I think I am a bad guy. I just don’t think I should be persecuted in anyway just because I am different. Why should my life be guided by someone else’s morality? Why should I live at the mercy of someone else, someone who admits they think me abnormal and unnatural?
Strange world. And of course, I do have to listen to what they say. Doesn’t mean that I will sit back and wait for them to decide what punishment suits me in my degraded state.
Heard this. At a conference about HIV, when some African activists were being asked about the persecution of gays in their countries, one government official was riled by all this emphasis on ‘rights’ for homosexuals. He stood up, and said, ‘They should be thankful. The law says we should stone them to death, but (in my country) we have not done that for years.’
Yeah, right.
Suicide to trust in the benevolence of one’s enemies. Should Ssempa or Nsaba-Buturo decide the best interests of gay people in

You are the most Paranoid person I have ever come across in my life
Paranoia (Description):Paranoia is a thought process characterized by excessive anxiety or fear, often to the point of irrationality and delusion. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs concerning a perceived threat towards oneself.
Oh, just so you should know, out of curiosity, I pulled up the Internet Protocol (IP) address you use to publish this blog, so I know the company to which it is registered,the host computer/laptop and therefore I know where you work. Your anonymous cover has been blown. An IP address is like a telephone number which you use to dial to the internet.If one wants to find it, they will, and I just did. I might (havent decided yet) tip off your boss about the precious expensive internet bandwidth you waste writing this blog yet you are free to be Gay and proud without being so brush and obnoxious about it. Now you have a reason to be paranoid
Ha Chris,
sigh, Of course I can guess who you are...!
So, besides being gay, and (the rest of the things I am), I am paranoid?
Thanks, I will fix that word into my vocabulary.
So, why does the paranoia of a stranger so interest you that you show off this kind of morbid fascination?
So, now you know everything about me? What is that going to help you with? It is really interesting. You have never commented on this blog under this pseudonym, but in a few words you have betrayed a lot about yourself.
About my anonymity, dont worry. I am not too worried...!
What a pathetic, bitter person "Chris" manages to make himself appear.
I think, given the violent homophobia we're seeing at the moment, gay people have good reason to fear for their livelihoods.
"Chris" - get a life. Preferably doing something useful. Away from here.

It has been so cool this summer here in the PNW that not only have my rhubarb plants started growing a second crop (woah), my strawberries are only now forming but more telling is that my blueberries have not yet had one turn blue – even vaguely blue. I am hoping though, I can see the first ones are starting to get the tiniest hue of blue on the edges. If we can get a couple warm days they may ripen. Thing is if it does warm up I will have what appears to be a bumper crop this summer! The bushes are loaded, even the new plants have put on berries. And with my little berry plantation now to over 15 plants….I want my berries!
I suppose that is still better than sitting in 100* temps so I am not complaining! Low 60′s is actually kind of nice…and I am wearing a sweater right now..lol!

I am about to get a gigantic crop of overgrown tomatoes! Wish me luck with all that Vitamin C!

Are you looking for a way to demonstrate the sustainability of the projects you are working on?
A growing number of executives at leading global infrastructure consulting and engineering firms believe that the key to sustainability, which includes balancing the need for economic development with the imperative to use resources prudently, goes well beyond buildings and must include surrounding infrastructure – power, transportation, building campuses, telecommunications, waste and water and wastewater, and all elements must be integrated. A growing number of these professionals also believe that it is necessary to develop a sustainability rating system for infrastructure, modeled on LEED and based on agreed-upon, and in many cases, quantifiable metrics. Such a system would provide a consensus-based measure of how localities are doing in bringing sustainability to their communities, as well as provide a clear yardstick for achievement by infrastructure developers, who increasingly need to justify their capital investments to stakeholders on the basis clear criteria. The Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI) and the Envision sustainable infrastructure rating system was developed just for this purpose.
The Environmental Business Journal November 10, 2012 article details how ISI has developed and is expanding on the Envision sustainable infrastructure rating system, which does just that.

Diversity, Heterotrophy, Autotrophy & Relationship with Antarctic Microorganisms
Project Description
The research project “DHARMA. Diversity, Heterotrophy, Autotrophy and Relations among Antarctic Microorganisms" was funded by the CICYT (ANT-97-1155). Led by Carlos Pedrós-Alió (ICM, CSIC), the project involved researchers from six Spanish and one foreign institutions. The project was carried out in the waters of the Southern Ocean, in an oceanographic expedition on the BIO Hesperides research vessel where we sampled the Drake Passage waters, the Wedell Sea and the Gerlache Strait. The objectives of this project were:
- To analyze the diversity of microbial communities in surface and deep Antarctic waters, and
- To know the effects of temperature on the different activities of microbial plankton.
Our group was responsible for analyzing the degradation processes of polymeric organic matter carried out by the bacterioplankton....

When the third presidential debate was held in Boca Raton, Fla., city police were able to bring together video feeds from three surveillance systems to a single location, giving them a better view of what was going on across the community.
The Boca Raton Police Department decided the expense of operating a physical security information management system in-house was worth it. Read more.
"It's not like a Super Bowl," which draws tens of thousands of spectators, reporters and on-site TV operations centers, said James Burke, the police department’s director of support services. But with 3,000 reporters and the Secret Service in town, the added visibility eased the task of coordinating security for the Oct. 22 debate.
The system, which remains a work in progress, is the result of a four-year-old initiative to tie together disparate video systems from different departments, including police, parks and traffic cameras, for the use of police analysts.
"We're trying to build a physical security information management component into our communications center," Burke said. To achieve this, the department in mid-2012 implemented the VidSys PSIM platform and began bringing in video systems.
The VidSys system was chosen for its ability to integrate a variety of systems into a single point immediately, as well as for its analytical features and ability to handle other forms of physical security data.
Full use of the system probably is another two years off, when the new communications system now being designed goes into operation.
"Right now it is reactive," he said of the department's use of the system. "And at this point it's strictly video." But plans call for eventually adding other information, such as intrusion alarms and data from gate access systems, and to begin using feeds for situational awareness and real-time analysis rather than solely as investigative tools after an incident has occurred.
The VidSys system addresses a growing market for management of the increasing volumes of data being generated as physical security goes online, be it from video surveillance, alarm and access control systems, chemical and biological sensors, radar and vehicle tracking systems.
"It can include any of the subsystems used by a city or agency," said VidSys CTO James Chong. The systems already in place usually are silo installations, often using proprietary protocols with no provisions for interoperability, which limits their use. To bring this data together, VidSys is agnostic to the type of data, communications protocols and hardware being used.
"We have the ability, through a software development kit to allow multiple departments' systems to talk to a common standard in the PSIM platform," Chong said.
PSIM is a younger sibling of security information management tools developed to bring some meaning to the growing volume of data being generated by IT security systems. Physical security traditionally has been a separate domain from information security, but as physical security systems began moving online to deliver and store data using IT systems to manage this data, and maybe even merge it with IT security data, became a viable option.
"It is a fairly new technology," not as mature as SIM, Chong said. But because the concept of information management through IT no longer is new, it is being adopted more quickly than SIM was in its earlier stages, he said. Some of that adoption has come from the demands of large events, such as the NCAA 2012 final four in men's basketball in Houston and the Baltimore Grand Prix.
"The event management piece is a growing part of our business," Chong said. "Some of the driver has been the sense of urgency when you have these events."
But more often, adoption is driven by the need for continuing visibility rather than managing a single event, such as in Boca Raton. Although combined video feeds were part of planning for the presidential debate, the decision to implement it was made well before the debate was scheduled.
VidSys' PSIM platform is Web based, residing on an application server in the user's network. Feeds coming into the server are translated to a common standard and filtering and correlation engines can analyze the data based on policies set by the customer.
Setting up policies for analysis can take several weeks, Chong said. "That's a collaborative process. It rarely starts from scratch." Most customers already have policies and procedures for handling security information, and these form the basis for PSIM policy. VidSys also has templates and policy libraries to help with development.
Policy development is not yet an issue for Boca Raton, where VidSys is being used simply to provide a common view for video feeds and not yet for analysis. But that common view is becoming increasingly important as the city in 2011 launched a citywide surveillance system with up to 200 cameras to monitor streets, parks and public buildings in the initial phase. Later expansion could include plans to partner with private business to bring their cameras into the system. The city is providing $538,000 to cover the cost of installation, and has a $700,000 Justice Department grant for construction of a new communications center and build-out of a wireless system carry video signals.
Burke said the city already had a robust fiber ring used to backhaul video. "When the fiber wasn't available, we're using a wireless mesh network to bring it onto the fiber as soon as possible."
The new communications center is expected to be operational in about two years, and is being designed to use the comprehensive video feed. A planned video wall will give real time views of the city, and will be used by dispatchers as well as crime analysts who are being trained to use the new system.
"It's an evolving process," Burke said the PSIM platform. Without additional data feeds and use of the analytics capabilities, the system has made the city's surveillance resources more valuable by integrating and making them more available to the police department. "We are happy with our purchase, even without all of the bells and whistles,".

This was a frightening performance by Eagles quarterback Michael Vick and it makes you question his development as a quarterback. Vick was making rookie mistakes like throwing the ball across the field, staring down receivers and making foolish and careless throws with the game on the line.
#1 – The first of the interceptions occurred when he was rolling to his left and under pressure from the pass rush. He tried to complete a pass to tight end Brent Celek, who was sitting in the middle of the field. When a quarterback is rolling to one side of the field, it draws the coverage to that side.
This was another case of Vick trying to play Superman, when a moment or two as Clark Kent would have been better. Browns defensive end Emmanuel Stephens beat left tackle King Dunlap inside and forced Vick to abandon the pocket. I will talk about the pathetic play of the offensive line later on.
Once he was forced out of the pocket, the quarterback should have started thinking about playing Clark Kent and abandoning the play by running out of bounds or throwing the ball away. He could have looked down that sideline to see if somebody was open, but no he still insists on playing Superman all the time, so he put on his cape.
I know Vick has a strong arm, but he broke a quarterback fundamental that is taught to ten-year old Pop Warner quarterbacks. Don’t throw the football across your body and across the field. Vick was attempting to throw the football back to his right by throwing it across his body without setting his feet. He got nothing on the throw.
Celek could have helped him by coming back to the football, but he waited for it, “patting his glove”, which is a mistake by any receiver. You always go get the football when it’s in the air because it lessens the opportunity for the defense to cut in front of you and pick it off.
Browns linebacker Craig Robertson took advantage of the situation came in from the other side to pick off the pass. It was an easy pick because Vick couldn’t get anything on the throw, so it was hanging up there and saying catch me.
The quarterback is only supposed to throw the football to that side or if his arm is strong enough, he can throw the ball over the coverage deep to the other side, if he can set his feet and follow through. That kind of throw is rare.
He should never throw the football across his body and across the field because he can’t get very much steam on it and it is sure to be picked off. For the most part, the quarterback needs to look downfield to the side of the field in which he is rolling and throw the ball in that direction, short or deep.
A quarterback is never supposed to throw the football to the short area in the middle of the field. It’s just like the rule in basketball where you never throw a cross court pass because it gives every defensive player a chance to intercept it.
#2 – On the second interception, the offensive line did a great job of protecting for their quarterback. Vick dropped deep into the pocket after faking a hand off to LeSean McCoy. He had plenty of time to see the entire field. Usually on these deep drops, Vick is looking downfield to DeSean Jackson or Jeremy Maclin. He spotted tight end Clay Harbor and decided he was going to go to him.
The throw was intended for Harbor who was open for an instant, but Vick was staring at him and taking his time getting him the football. The Browns were in a zone coverage and middle linebacker D’Quell Jackson was in the middle of the field, but started moving to his right as he followed Vick’s eyes. Jackson should have picked the ball off, but it went through his hands and was picked off by Cleveland outside linebacker L.J. Fort.
Cleveland safety T.J. Ward was standing right behind Harbor and draped over him when the ball arrived. The throw had no chance of making it to Harbor.
#3 – On the next interception, Vick tried to hit Maclin on a crossing from the right side of the formation to the left. This was the one interception which wasn’t Vick’s fault. He put the throw on Maclin’s hands as he got to the left side of the formation.
Maclin had a tough time yesterday. He was hit a number of times after making some tough catches. The young wide receiver was in and out of the lineup because of physical problems during the game.
I think an earlier hit on a crossing route, influenced Maclin to peak downfield just before Vick put the ball in the air. The wideout put his hands out as the ball came his way, but his focus was totally on the football and that’s what caused him to let the ball hit off his hands and into the hands of Browns cornerback Joe Haden.
I have to give Vick credit for not giving up on the play because he hustled downfield and stopped Haden from taking the ball into the end zone.
#4 – On his final interception of the day, Vick dropped into the pocket and followed Jeremy Maclin from his outside alignment on the Birds right side. Number 18 was running an inside curl route versus a simple strong-zone defense.
His eyes were straight down the field during the entire play. The signal caller didn’t try to look any of the defenders off by looking to his left or his right. He was tunnel vision, looking straight down the middle of the field and attempting to connect with Maclin on the curl route.
Maybe he thought he was invisible because Browns middle linebacker D’Qwell Jackson broke on the football when Vick let it go and cut in front of Maclin. The lefthanded quarterback lifted his arm and left go of the throw as if there was nobody in the area. Jackson simply reached up to pick off the pass and continued down the sideline.
He showed off his speed while taking the ball in for a touchdown, while doing a forward full-body flip.
#5 – Or course on the last drive of the game, Fort let a Vick pass go right through his hands on a throw Vick made which was intended for Maclin. If the young linebacker had caught the football, it would have cost the Eagles the game.
Short URL:
To me it seemed like Vick’s head was everywhere else but in this game yesterday. Towards the end he woke up a little but he is gonna get himself hurt out there if he plays like that against the Ravens Defense. btw I give all credit to the Eagles Defense who carried this team on its back yesterday.
Wonder what the feeling would be if the Browns Defender held onto that bad Pass by Vick in the End-Zone the play before he threw the winning TD Pass to Harbor.. Game and Season would have been over..
Can you imagine that Paulman. It would have been a 16-10 5 interception loss. ANd that’s what it really should have been.
I was on the phone to a guy in Cleveland after they took the lead, and he was all, “ah, we’ll still find a way to lose”. If we hadn’t been playing Cleveland, we wouldn’t have won.
There were several other incidences when Vick threw the ball into heavy coverage. There were at least 2 balls batted down at the line. There were 2 fumbles.
I mean seriously….4 ints, 2 fumbles, 2 batted…..what does this guy have to do before he gets benched?
Vinnie – you are exactly what I thought you were…a catcher! bend over and just take it type of cat….you’re a grown ass man, on the phone with a man in Cleveland? and you are known for calling Rex Grossman “sexy Rexy”…Vinnie you are a limp wrist fraud…live your life by day as husband, family man…by night, on the phone with strange men from Cleveland…
The announcers kept talking about how confused vick looked! it is a constant with him. i remember when jim johnson was the dc and vick was in atlanta that i was never worried about him because JJ would confuse him with blitz schemes. nothing has changed! in his last like 10 games he has thrown 22 td’s and 20 ints-
he also put the ball on the ground yesterday-
I’m also ready a lot of…”oh well he was rusty….”
BS.
In Atlanta
“He’ll be a good QB when they get real Wrs”
“He’ll be a good QB when they get a real coach”
“He’ll be a good QB when they improve the oline”
In Philly
“He’ll be a good QB when they get a real Oline”
“He’ll be a good QB when Reid changes the play-calling”
“He’ll be a good QB when he has a full offseason to practice”
And now….its because he missed the preseason games (interesting – same anti-Foles crowd who went on and on about how Foles only played in “meaningless” pre-season games are now bemoning the fact that Vick needed those same meaningless games)
“He’ll be a good QB when he gets more reps under his belt”
What will be next week’s excuse? And the week after that.
I originally predicted that Foles would become the starter week 12. I’m moving that up to week 6 now.
He couldn’t do worse.
I disagree the 3rd INT was not on Vick – yes Maclin tipped it – but watch the play again if you can 1) good protection 2) Vick had happy feet and was dancing around 3) he was sliding forward and sidearmed it it out to Maclin and it sailed 4) instead of being delivered belt high in front – the pass was high and in front..
Not at all impressed with Vick yestruday -
on the OLine – nice run blocking – should have run the ball more – good pass protection in the 2nd half – sometimes the other team sends more people then you can block – QB needs to exploit that..
on the good side – Vick did throw a couple into the sidelines!
no excuses, Vick made some very poor decisions and got lucky to come away with the win…Vick did rise to the occasion and lead one of those 4th qtr drives to win the game…you know the kind, that many of you say he isn’t capable of doing…well he did!
I’m disappointed with the decisions but happy with the win…
We def need better play from MV7 week 2…
Real cmon wake up Vick blows dude.
Vinnie you must of love watching yesterday’s game…all but the end when Vick helped get the Birds in the end zone for a win…
Everyone is overlooking the elephant in the room….and that is the play calling…I was watching the game with my sons….my 9 year old says, why we keep getting in the shot gun? when are we going to run the ball? came to the point where my 9 year old new that the Eagles were going to pass, pass, pass….there was nothing being done to keep Cleveland off balance…but what about the penalties? how many plays were brought back because of penalties…and i’m talking about plays 15+ yards…it was awful across the board…only thing that looked good was the defense!
Agreed Navy. That throw was high and wide.
Realtalk….You’re being pretty favourable saying that last drive was “rising to the occasion”. Vick went 6 of 12 on the final drive. At least 3 of his throws hit Cleveland defenders (the 2nd last throw being the diciest) and could have been picked, and he fumbled once. There were at least 4 occasions on that drive (the fumble and 3 into Browns defenders) when Vick tried his best to give the ball to the Browns, but they, being the Browns, didn’t want it.
I can only imagine what you’d be saying on here if it was Kolb, or any other QB who had vomited up the 4 (5) INT, 2 fumble disaster that Vick orchestrated yesterday.
Would you be saying he, “made some poor decisions”? Doubtful. You’d be calling for his assasination.
umm did I say Vick played great? no…what in my comments make you think I’m giving Vick accolades for his performance…Since when does “what if’s” matter? what if Vick threw and INT on the final drive? did he? what if he loss the fumble? what if, what if, what if…
Did anyone question Brady when he threw 4 picks in a loss to the Bills last season? nope…
Brady also has won multiple SB’s, is arguably the best in the NFL & is a walk in HOF! Not even a comparison for discussion. Put the wet down.
Real out of curiosity am I a hater or racist still because I can see this guy is awful and always has been?
Real I could be wrong and tell me if I am but I thought I remember you telling me you were making 100k a year and had a great job? If that is correct I want to point out that you are very fortunate to have got that job when you don’t know that shotgun is one word not two, also you dont know the difference between new and knew.
If you are someone different my apologies in advance
@Mhenski @Vinnie
I knew your stance on Vick before the game was even played yesterday…i’m sure you both enjoyed watching Vick struggle…
you guys seem to have some insight on Vick and his performance…how did you like the play calling? was it good? how about the O Line? penalties?
Eagles 1-0 last time I checked….that is what’s important
@Mhenski – actually I make 90K and I’m 31, you’re 45, right? make less money right? and part of my money goes to you and your family for Wick assistance right? dumb ass! you still jealous I see… …and honestly we aren’t in grammar school, so get off my nuts
Who calls 56 passes in the first game of the year and our tailback just had a Allpro year…oh wait..he was actually the best back in the league according to some?Walrus.Come on bro.
I saw that coming in the second after they scored.Hes tossing it too much and the Browns are gonna get a few.
End of the game he engineered a 4th quarter comeback.He didnt turn the ball over. He almost threw a pick.Harbor almost didnt catch the td pass.Guess what…he did.
1-0….stop wasting your time talking about Mike like hes some inept moron incapable of not improving.
Big bad oldmen Balty coming to town without a DMVP….i like our defense against that offense and my guess is Mike is more effective. There o-line is old and worn out.Get after Ray Rice.DRC on Smith…advantage Birds…Boldin on Nmandi…Birds.Ray Rice could be tough.
Negadelph
Thankfully I missed the game for a Christening. I had thought that Fowles would take over on injury, but I wonder if another dreadful performance by Vick will accellerate things. Vick never seems to overcome his superman tendencies. Playing Baltimore should be very difficult unless we get a great QB play.
enjoyed? thats idiotic, i had no joy watching this bum struggle it pained me because he is worse than i thought and remembered. i root for the eagles and vick im just real that the guy is a total loser.
regarding the coaching absolutely dreadful, whoever was calling the plays and drew up the game-plan shouldnt be coaching in the nfl. after yesterday i am 10000% convinced that reid is just as awful as vick. going into the 4th quarter shady had 11 carries and vick had 40+passing attempts and we were winning basically the whole time, that is just totally idiotic. we have one of the best rbs in the god damn game… reid, vick and marty gotta go cant win with them.
i watched vick a lot yesterday and all i saw him do is lock onto one wr and force the throw on almost everyplay. i did not see him go through his reads once, all i saw was lock onto the #1 option and if he didnt throw to the #1 option he just checked down and never looked at his true #2 option on the play. this tells me is awful and will continue to be. he is fortunate the eagles have playmakers that CAN make him look decent SOME GAMES.
“Did anyone question Brady when he threw 4 picks in a loss to the Bills last season? nope…”
Ummm…because Brady is a multiple Superbowl MVP winning Qb and gets the benefit of the doubt. Wheras Vick is a deteriorating never-was, sub .500 in the playoffs turnover machine. and therefor does not have the luxury of the benefit of the doubt. That’s why.
I did not enjoy watching Vick struggle. I found it very infuriating (though predictable). I also found it extremely annoying that Reid kept trotting out there disasterous drive after disadterous drive.
The Browns scored 16 pts yesterday, and Vick was directly responsible for every one of them. (oh, and to took my own worn, I wrote this on this site 2 days before the game:
“Vick is a master at keeping both teams in the game. One big run followed by one big sack.
I can easily see an early sack-fumble leaging to a Cleveland 3, then a VickPick for another 3 and Birds get out of the half 10-6……
Into the second…..and its some close 17-13 into the late 3rd. Vick will pull off some escapee Savardian spin-o-rama for 30yrds…..Leads to a TD.
All the Vickpologists will say, “see – he’s amazing!! He won the game!!” Forgetting that Cleveland was only competitive due to his early foibles…
Remember that this Cleveland team has a new owner. Everyone and his dog (pardon the pun) knows there will be wholesale changes next year at GM and every coaching position….along with players….this is dead team walking.”
Am I happy that Vick is this predictable? No. Am I gloating that I predicted exactly what would happen – you’re going to interpret it as that – but I’m not. I hate that this team will go nowhere untill we have a competent QB behind centre.
Vick was once a bad QB who could compensate with his legs…now that those are fading (and fast) he’s just a bad QB.
Again Vinnie/Mhenski – we know you dont like Vick and we agree that Vick played very poor for a majority of the game yesterday…
any thoughts, on the play calling? could that have helped out the QB? O Line? penalties? any thoughts, or are you only concerned with Vick play…
in my opinion, there are more concerns on this offense than Vick, and it all starts with the play calling !
vin well said and very articulate!
This site sucks. I see comments over in the recent comment area but when I try and go to the article to read them it is limited to a few comments and not the most recent. I have stopped coming on here because it has become so frustrating. Fix this thing G!!!
52%
4ints (could have been a lot more)
2 fumbles
Against Cleveland.
Keep defending.
yea Vinnie thats right, I forgot we (Eagles) won 10 SB’s already because we had so many competent QB’s in the past…I totally forgot….
Vick’s legs are fading? where the hell do you get that from? He still looked fast as hell to me…
Congrats Vinnie on your special day.
Recognizing that Vick s a terrible QB isn’t a very sepecial feat Stevo.
Ignoring reality and desperately remaining lached onto his nut sack with a litany of, “Hewasjustrustymissingrepsinthepreseasonwaittillnextweekitstheplaycallingthatmakeshimterrible” excuses. Well, that’s pretty special.
As for your other points Real
1 – The playcalling needs work, Shady was having success and Vick was struggling and I don’t know why they kept throwing…but on the flip side…he’s the QB. He’s supposed to be able to throw the ball. I’ll echo what Navy said earlier. If you want the Eagles’ to run the ball 40x and have Vick only throw 20x because you don’t trust him. Then why is he the QB.
2 – You will suddenly see a dramatic improvement in the oline the moment Vick is replaced. You can count on that. Pockets collapse all the time. Its the nature of 300lb men charging forward. Vick doesn’t know how to deal with this…slide to the side or forward. Its not in his nature.
3 – You will also see a reduction in holding penalties when the Oline no longer has to block for the QB who is (and we’ve already shown thiis over and over) one of the slowest making decisions in the league.
There are several problems with this O that need to be worked out, that’s for sure, but QB is absolutely the most important.
ERock, I am pretty excited to see the D play next week against Balt. I am really concerned with him catching screens and dump-offs.
Vick is still fast. OOOOOOOH!!!! That’s going to win us a SB now, isn’t it?!?!?
My Take
Clearly Vick played like crap. If this happens next week he needs to be benched. However, the first half was not his fault. In fact, the jelled together there at the end of the first half with a few really nice plays. The first half issues were 1…. Penalties. Every great play was called back because of holding. Hard to get pissed at Vick when he starts every drive with 1st and 20. 2. The Oline sucked. Flat out sucked. On top of the first half woes i really dont understand why the fat man wont run. I just dont get it.
Thats the fun part Vinnie….. id love to see you show me ANYTIME ive ever said anything about how amazing he is. You are arguing with an Atlanta fan from 2001 im guessing because I never ever said anything like that.
@DCAR hahaha – you are a funny cat…
guess what…you never know, Vick may have to use his legs which will help us win a SB…and guess what….we’ve had QB’s that stand in the pocket and we haven’t won a SB yet, so shut the hell up!
Glad, you get my sarcasm. ROFL!!!!
This is something we need to get straight…my only wish for this season is that the Eagles win the SB…my wish doesn’t revolve on Vick completing 30 plus TD passes, Vick rushing for over 1000 yards…my wish is for the EAGLES to win a SB…I don’t care how they do it, or how they get it done! A SB is what I want it is that simple!
Exactly Real. I dont own a Vick jersey, I never will. Why? because of who he has shown himself to be as a person. But i darn well will be rooting for him every week to do what he can do. Im not going to apologize for being a fan for my team.
@DCAR and in response to your Brady/Vick comment…
Brady hasn’t won a SB since 2004 and he needed a little help winning possibly all 3…we all know the Patriots and the cheating, plus he had some teammates that had a little to say in regards to winning a championship….Almost 10 years ago, so get off his nuts and again shut the hell up!
Real, he’s won 3, 1 as a rookie, after being drafted in the 6th round, & has been to 5 SB’s. 5!!! Last year, he led his team to the SB, with one of the worst defenses, in the NFL. WTF, are you talking about. It’s sour grapes, with the cheating excuse. Cut it out man, you make yourself look clueless. I ain’t on anybodies nuts. I love the Eagles & hate the Patriots, but I can respect a REAL, great, leader at QB, & not the dumb @$$ fraud, we currently have, making a futile attempt to do the same.
here’s a fascinating thing: The only two times Sunday that Vick looked comfortable, the only two times he got into a rhythm, were at the end of the two halves. Drove the Eagles 74 yards in just 32 seconds for a touchdown in the closing seconds of the second quarter, then put together that game-winning 16-play, 91-yard drive in the closing moments of the game.
Think about what happens at the end of a half. Things speed up. Everything moves faster. The plays come in quicker, the ball is spotted quicker, the huddle breaks quicker. There’s little time to think. Just call the play, drop back and fire. And that’s when Vick excelled Sunday.
That’s what Vick needs to get back to all the time. Call the play, break the huddle, take the snap, drop back and fire for 60 minutes instead of four or five minutes. Find that two-minute drill rhythm early and keep it.
Stop over-thinking everything
Real not knowing the difference between new and knew isn’t grammar bud it’s spelling and it demonstrates your a fucking idiot just 1 of the many examples.
Not knowing the difference between grammar and spelling is another definition of how much of a fucking mental midget you are too.
Damn you got my nuts all in your mouth and all on your chin, bitch! so maybe you got better spelling grades than I did, maybe did better in English class…but I love how my 90K salary is pissing you off! you jealous bastard! Like I said, if we were face to face, I’d whoop your ass all through the city of brotherly, while making you say Vick is the best QB in the league! Alot of you clowns talk big shit over the internet!
That being said…. Im fine if Foles comes in sooner than later. I want a ring, dont care who gives it to us.
Great blog I thought id share
So Rizzo had his shot to try to talk us all down off a ledge and make us appreciate getting the W over anything else, but that’s all horseshit. The Eagles’ offense didn’t simply play poorly yesterday, they straight-up made a fool out of all of us. Andy Reid and Marty Mornhinweg told us all off-season (and every year for the past 5 years) that they wouldn’t do this again…then went right ahead and did it! We’re like battered wives who keep getting talked into coming back home. “It’ll be different from now on baby I swear.” Then what did we do? We just put the frozen steak on our black eye and walked back into the house without calling the cops. Well win or loss I’m fucking sick of it. FIFTY-SIX CALLED PASSES my dude? FOUR (should have been FIVE) interceptions? Motherfuck you both.
The simple fact that Fat Andy had the stones to call 56 passes when his All-Pro best-player-on-the-team was ripping off 10 yard chunks every time he touched the rock should be a fire-able offense. Just consider the very BASIC and COMMON-SENSE reasons why the Eagles should have run more:
LeSean McCoy was averaging 5.5 yards per carry.
Michael Vick is a fragile figurine made of glass and Super Bowl predictions.
Michael Vick had thrown multiple interceptions already.
We had the lead.
Our offensive line was getting called for holding every other play.
The Browns D was 30th against the run and 2nd against the pass.
Joe Haden.
Maclin already got injured twice in the game.
LESEAN MCCOY WAS AVERAGING 5.5 YARDS PER CARRY.
I can’t think of another coach in the league who would even dream of having the boulders to keep daring his quarterback to throw another pick/get assassinated by a much improved Cleveland D. It literally makes zero sense. And what did that fat fuck say was his reason for passing the ball 56 times with an injury-prone quarterback, the lead, AND a Pro-Bowl RB at his disposal:
.”
This dude must’ve gotten higher than any of his children ever have to say some audacious nonsense like that. Shady had one fumble, dog. One. Vick was picked off four times. What fat idiot backwards-reasoning Mormon God planet are you living on, Andy?
And Mike — keep freaking out in the pocket, scrambling like a decapitated chicken, then throwing it across your body into double coverage. We all can’t get enough of that shit. I mean, who wants to see their quarterback actually READ the coverage, step up in the pocket, and make a confident throw downfield? Not us. We just love seeing you play shitty jazz when everybody else is playing classical they’re reading from sheet music.
No matter what any glass-half-full jokers want to feed you this week, stay true to yourself and remember how you felt watching the game. Doesn’t matter if we’re the #1 defense and #2 offense in the league. A win isn’t always just a win. Sometimes it’s proof that your local Philly Barstool blogger knows more about what’s better for the Eagles than the own coaching staff does. I predicted the offense would be the worry for this season more than the D, but never did I think our own head coach would call plays like he threw down $100 Large on the Browns.
agreed all around mhenski. exactly.
The Browns may have lost yesterday, but there is no doubt that Dick Jauron is still laughing about the errors that he was able to force the Birds to make. For all of the talk about Andy & Marty game planning for months, Jauron certainly had a plan for this offense, but the stubborness of the head coach and OC to stick with the pass and leave their All-Pro running back without the ball is something they cannot continue to do if they plan on winning many more games.
If Vick & Reid are back next year I wonder what will be there reasoning for optimism and or their excuse for Vicks poor play this season. Oh wait I already know it will be – Vick didnt have a preseason to prepare for the season .
TEAM WORK!!!!! Makes the dream work. Rich Hoffman Philly.com has a great article and perspective of the game. WOW did i just type that. umm hmm. But dang isn’t this a team sport? Everyone wants to focus on Vick so much, and yes he had a poor day, yes, he is the QB, but what stood out to me was the way this team BATTLED through a very tough opponent seated as the underdogs. Remember the phrase ANY GIVEN SUNDAY? that means that any given sunday you can get absolutely spanked in the NFL by any team, because this is the NFL. Yeah Vick had a horribly disgusting game, but Shaddy Mcoy, DRC, and Demeco Ryans, and Ashimogua had exceptional plays that carried this team and Vick to victory. Everybody wants to see Vick fail to prove thier points, and themselves right about this QB. EVEN YOU “G” say it aint so. But next Sunday when he bangs another 400 yards on that A#$ what will the headlines be? VICK SHINES BUT!!!!!!!!! anyway take ya head out of it. This eagles TEAM showed some toughness and RESOLVE yesterday. E.A.G.L.E.S
@TheONe1 – good post!
the one…. make no mistake this is a team game with the qb being the absolute most important position.
2. did i read a while ago that brady threw 4 ints and vick should be given the same consideration? yeah right.
3. the o line gets too much blame. 7 holds the ball with happy feet instead of getting rid of the ball… why? because he can’t read defenses!
“Michael Vick is a fragile figurine made of glass and Super Bowl predictions.”
Laughed my ass off on that one
“scrambling like a decapitated chicken” Fantastic.
“
Watched Peyton Manning last night and wept for the beauty of seeing a true pro play the game with his Mind and Body to throw off a good defense. If we don’t get a QB that knows the position (i think foles does…he is not manning dont twist this) we are screwed and wasting guys like 10,18,25,87….
Still laughing at real talk calling out vinnies manhood, on the phone with some other man from Cleveland, reminds me of the godfather telling that sap to man up and take care of your family ,hey vinnie, great analysis of Vick but seriously man up, get off the damn phone with some queer from Cleveland, take care if business at home

How can genealogy attract more Millennials and Gen X and Yers?
Is it even possible?
Yes, but properly snaring them seems to require the right fishing technique. Depending on who you ask, the traditionalist says it’s all in the lure while another claims it’s the casting technique that really matters. Then there are the shoulder-shrugging types who say, “A day off, my lucky hat, and a cooler full of beer—who cares whether I catch any fish?”
In the past few weeks, more than a few articles have wondered whether the genealogy field might be labeled the laissez-faire fisherman type than the industrious lure and casting trawler.
High Definition Genealogy goes straight for the jugular by stating several reasons just why people younger than 45 might think this field yanks the welcome carpet out from under their feet. A recent post on Roots and Rambles goes further, observing that conference dates and times often conflict with school and work day commitments while the cost of the conference itself can be prohibitive for families on a budget. One younger enthusiast commented that at a conference, ‘The woman behind me said “Aren’t you too young to be doing genealogy?”
Welcome, indeed.
Thankfully, technology is helping to tear all of this down. Between Roots Television, genealogy Twitter lists, genealogy blogs, and countless articles now popping up online, the perceived age gap is finally narrowing.
However, we believe the best Catch-And-Don’t-Release award goes to John Harris.
Mr. Harris, a teacher in Somerset, Pennsylvania, came up with an innovative way to snare Millennials through their own tools. His “Hunting History: Discovering Your Hometown” high school class has students using GPS devices to track down old churches and specific cemetery headstone markers from coordinates given out in class.
Harris says: “When you can offer something that kids can get their hands on – in their backyard – when they go through town, they see historical sites. When you can turn them on to that, word gets out that that’s pretty fun. They discover the history all on their own.”
He’s on to something because not only did he win a $5,000 award from the History Channel but more importantly, this elective, twice a year class maxing out 30 students per semester, is always full. That’s sixty new history and genealogy enthusiasts caught each year.
Now that’s a winning fishing technique that gets ‘em while their young.

Excellent points! I wonder if starting a History [sort-of] Geocaching game would be a good idea. I say “sort-of” because no one would be hiding the treasure. It’s already there. Kind of a new spin on genealogy research. Do you realize how many play Geocaching? It’s like a cult. [Shrugs] Something to ponder.

Funny you should mention this. I’m planning on writing an article about geocaching and cemeteries sometime next week!”

Today I did a guest lecture for CPSC 310, the software engineering class at one of the local universities that’s compulsory for the computer science degree program. I took this class when I did my degree there, and I really disliked it - it was in the process of being redesigned, I believe, and we only got through about half of the required material. At the time, it convinced me that I hated process and just wanted to keep my head down in the code. How times have changed!
The curriculum has changed since I took the course, although it is still mainly focused on traditional software engineering techniques. I was quite excited this past summer when I was asked to give a guest lecture in the class on the topic of what I do at work. I’ve spoken at schools before on the topic of Agile development, but never in a software engineering class. Apparently I did a passable job, as I was asked back to lecture this term.
I’ve never given the same presentation twice (although I’ll have an opportunity to do that soon), so I still have troubles with timing and fitting in all my content, but I think today’s talk went well. It was 50 minutes, less than half the length of the talk I gave this summer, so I had to cut out a lot of content. I know what I’d do next time to fix up the pacing, so hopefully I’ll get another chance to try it out.
Now that I’ve given a talk or two to professional groups, I actually find student groups more of a challenge. With professional groups, I can assume a certain level of base knowledge and experience, and if someone isn’t familiar with a term they’re quick to ask for clarification. With students, I’m often dealing with people who have never developed software professionally with a team. If I was talking about programming languages, that wouldn’t be an issue, but since I talk about shipping software, team dynamics, and process, I’m always scared that I’ll leave people behind. Students can also be quite timid, so if they don’t understand something they’re not necessarily going to put up their hand.
I don’t mind talking to students, and I want to get better at it, but to do that I’ll need to find a balance of easily-understood terminology and widely applicable concepts. In the meantime, I look forward to my next two presentations, both of which will be in front of professional audiences.
(Once upon a time I had another blog at a similar URL, which I hardly ever updated and which was subsequently hardly ever read. I’m posting more frequently now, but I since I have a slightly higher readership I thought I’d share some of the old posts I think still stand up. The project I mentioned shipped and was a success.
The title of this blog post comes from a Bad Religion song.)
For those not familiar with the ideas behind Lean software (and even for those who are!), please check out Competing on the Basis of Speed, a talk given to Google by Mary Poppendieck in 2006. One of my work goals for 2010 [ and 2011! - Ed.] is to compete on the basis of speed. Specifically, I want to help my team:
I think I’m already off to a good start. The aim of the project I’m currently working on is to add functionality to our product that makes it easier to integrate into customers’ existing infrastructure. The technical requirements are known to us, and we’ve finished implementing the functionality. However, we’re at a point where we’ve hit a bit of a wall - no one on the team has any experience as a consumer of this functionality (that is to say, none of us are IT administrators), and it has been difficult to get focused feedback from others within our organization who have such experience. What it comes down to is that we’ve got a feature that is technically correct (follows RFC specifications, has been load tested, etc.) but has not been tuned to customer environments.
This is not an uncommon situation in software - in fact, it’s part of the reason why “Have an embedded customer representative on the team” is a practice in Extreme Programming. However, it’s not always possible to find internal “customers” (we call them Product Managers) with extensive experience with every particular area of the field. For larger projects it may make sense to train the Product Manager in the specifics of the new functionality by having them consult heavily with paying customers, but for smaller projects this is not always feasible. My current project is less than a month old and we’re code complete, and much of the time was over the Christmas holidays with our Product Manager (and most of our customers) on vacation, so consultation wasn’t much of an option.
So, here we stand - a mostly finished project that can be release-ready within 2 weeks but that has not been fine-tuned to meet all customer requirements (as such requirements are unknown). What to do? The traditional approach within the company has been to do a beta, but these don’t necessarily solve all problems. Our betas are opt-in, and often contain very few members (less than .5% of our customer base). Feedback can be hard to gather as beta systems are often put into non-production situations. There is also quite a bit overhead involved in coordinating and communicating with all of the customers involved.
Instead, I’m pushing towards getting this thing released to all customers as early as possible. The more people playing with it the better. The code is not buggy (we hope!), it just may be lacking some specific features or compatibility. Rather than wait around for 2 or 3 months as we do research and try to completely accurately model customer scenarios (a process that’s inevitably difficult and fraught with errors), we’ll get the code out into the field.
The best case scenario is that everything we’ve done so far is adequate for the market, and there are no future requirements. This means we’ve starting recognizing value 2-3 months earlier than if we had waited and done more market research, and we haven’t sat around gold plating the project for a quarter. The most likely scenario is that our code is adequate for some, but others will need some enhancements before it will work for them. We can then prioritize these enhancements based on some sort of financial metric (renewal date of customers who need the feature, likelihood that the enhancement will bring new customers, etc.) and deliver them over the next little while.
The worst case scenario is by far the least likely to happen - that would be where customers get the new feature, find that it’s not quite up to snuff, and because of this decide to overhaul their IT infrastructure and rip out all of our company’s products because of this. That’s so unlikely that it’s barely worth mentioning. Something like this is more likely in the case where we’re changing an existing feature instead of adding a new one, but even then it’s a slim slim chance, and would be the result of a decision on the customer’s part based on emotion rather than reason.
If you presented a customer with the choice between the following two options:
… I’m willing to bet that most customers would pick the first option. The choice would be even easier once the customer realized that the “complete” version from the second option would likely have to be followed up by a release or two afterward containing improvements that the developers / Product Management failed to identify in the first go-round.
I’m excited that there seems to some buy-in to this approach so far - hopefully it pays off for us!
For the past two years, I’ve been managing a software team. This role has a lot of requirements, and I think I’ve been fairly successful, but there’s one thing I used to do that I never really do any more - program. Sure, I review a lot of code, and occasionally pair with people or help problem solve, and when asked I give my opinion on architecture, but it’s been a while since I’ve sat down with some code to myself and tried to get something done.
Well, I’m trying to change that. I’ve realized (through a few false starts) that I’m not going to pick up a new programming language, hop into an open source project, and start contributing. I think I have the ability to do so, but definitely not the motivation. Instead, I’m going to chip away at small improvements in my product’s code base that will hopefully make life easier for my team. For now, I’m going to stay away from changing a lot of production code - I want to ease myself back into the groove slowly, and while I’m not afraid that I’ll write a bunch of awful code and ship to customers, I don’t want to get too bogged down in our automated test rig at the moment.
I’ve got two little projects going on right now. The first is to add Perl::Critic tests to all of our packages. Perl Critic is a highly configurable automated code style critic, inspired by Perl Best Practices, that can help you detect all sorts of wrongness in your code. It’s easy to add a test, and then a lot of fun (for various definitions of “fun”) chasing down all the failures and getting your code up to snuff. I’ve only added the test to one package so far, but it’s a package with over 100 files so it took me a while to clean up. Subsequent packages should be easier, and it should be self-enforcing going forwards (as all of our tests are required to pass before a build is produced).
The second project is to ease our use of CPAN modules by rewriting part of our build system to use cpanminus. Our current system makes it difficult to import CPAN packages, or even upgrade the ones we have easily, so I think this could really benefit us. Replacing some of the packages we’re still using from 2002 would be most welcome, and there’s a lot of exciting stuff being developed for Perl right now that would be ncie to experiment with. So far I’ve got just been playing around a bit with cpanminus, but I’ve already managed to find a bug (I think - I’ve filed it anyway). I may write more on this once I’ve got it working.
These aren’t exactly monumental bits of code I’m fiddling with, but it feels good to get back into it, and the important thing is that I’m actually motivated to do this coding. I have no desire to go back to being a full time developer, but it’s nice to keep up my technical skills..
As previously mentioned, I’ve got a talk coming up for a UBC class. This is the required software engineering class in the UBC Computer Science program, and a class I vividly remember as being a waste of my time. Fortunately, the course content has changed quite a bit since I took it - after four months in this class, I came out with a 25 page specification package and no code written. It was one of my least favourite classes, and it convinced me that I didn’t care at all about process (how things have changed!).
I spoke at this class during the summer, but I plan to deliver quite a different talk this time. Part of this is time - this summer I had two hours, and two weeks from now I have half that. Time isn’t the only factor - the more fundamental difference is in the content. While the talks I’ve given to previous classes before have been rather broad overviews of Agile (and more recently Lean) concepts, this time I’m going more with what I know best. That means less theory, and more description of how my team successfully delivers software. I’ve talked to the class instructor about this and she also thinks it’s a good idea.
I’m still finalizing an outline, and I need to make sure I present this at a level that’s approachable to a class of students who likely have no real (professional) software development experience. I also hope to find time to polish my slides, and make sure I’m not just reading list after list of bullet points, but I’ll have to see what time permits.
Even though I work for company that has millions of end users and is one of the leaders of its industry, whenever I tell people where I work I’m met with blank stares. Why? Unlike some of our competitors, Sophos doesn’t sell directly to consumers (you won’t find us for sale at Best Buy, nor are we bundled when you buy a Dell) - we only sell to business, governments, schools, and other organizations. Thus, blank stares. Luckily, Sophos has come to my rescue and released a great free tool that’s already raised their profile among non-business users - Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac (Home Edition). Best of all, this release is free!
Now, I know what some of you are thinking - why would I bother with anti-virus for my Mac? Well, Macs are not immune to malware, and they can host Windows malware that can infect friends and family. Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac is featured on Apple.com, is mentioned as a staff pick, and has been positively reviewed in several places. I’ve been running this for a while, and it’s hardly noticeable, even though I have hundreds of gigabytes of files on my Mac. The one time where I did notice it is when I downloaded a “demo” of a program (a torrent of something that I wanted to see the interface for), and it immediately detected a keylogger in one of the files.
If you have a Mac, there’s no real reason not to be running this.

Ha ha I tricked you--I'm not discussing anything risque here, just oil stuff. As readers of Crash Landing know, I have been pontificating at Hayekian-like length on the oil markets, and in particular whether speculators are driving up prices. My general answer has been that it is theoretically possible they are doing so, but I don't think in fact that they are.
Now the one thing that has really been worrying me in my stance is this: With war brewing with Iran--where they might mine the Strait of Hormuz etc.--shouldn't speculators be driving oil prices way up? Shouldn't there be massive contango (or something more exotic involving the prices of options) in the oil market, giving people the incentive to buy oil today and stockpile it? As I speculated (ha ha) earlier, I think one of the reasons the Bush Administration was so reluctant to cease filling the SPR, is that we are going to need that oil if Israel bombs Iran.
But I need to take the (un)friendly criticism of emailers to heart, when after my articles on futures markets they blast me with, "We don't have a free market in oil!!"
Let's say you are a refiner and so you actually know how to stockpile thousands of barrels of oil. (Most people, especially me, would have no freaking idea how to do this.) Further suppose that you are really convinced there will be war with Iran before Bush leaves office.
OK, so are you really going to pay $1.4 million to buy 10,000 barrels of oil, then shell out another $?? to warehouse them for six months, buy insurance in case someone robs you or starts a fire, etc., and then try to sell them for a total of $4.2 million when oil triples? Do you really think when oil is selling for $420 per barrel, and we realize we've got about 2 months' worth of net imports in the SPR, that the politicians are going to say, "Good job, Mr. Speculator! Like a wise squirrel, you hoarded 10,000 barrels. In this country, such foresight is rewarded with entrepreneurial profits! Ah, don't forget to pay a low capital gains tax on that profit. Our small government needs its funding too, don't ya know" ?
Of course that wouldn't happen. Your oil would be seized and you'd be lucky if you didn't get shot as an example.
So this explains to my satisfaction why no US citizens, at least, are stockpiling oil like crazy. It doesn't, by itself, explain why speculators aren't driving up prices, but I wonder if there is something similar going on.
Bob,
Speaking of the Strait of Hormuz, now that you are a Big Oil insider, tell us if the insiders think it can be mined, since at its narrowest it's 20 something miles wide?
I don't know, RW. I'm in with oil guys but the only minesweeper I know is on my old computer.
Back when I did research for my novel, I had looked into the basics of mining etc. I think if Iran wanted to, they could definitely move the supply curve left.
Okay, just wanted to make sure you weren't a terrorist, after that Hillary/Obama plane.

Figured I'd dust of Ye Olde General Admission to do a rundown of my Top 10 Favorite Albums of 2010. I've effectively deluded myself into thinking people might actually care about my opinion, because nothing says Musical Authority™ quite like a person sitting at their computer in a basement who can neither sing nor play an instrument.
Anyhow, I've traditionally thought of myself as an Indie Rock Kid. But, ignoring the fact that I'm 35, the main thing that's surprising about this list is the near complete absence of indie rock. One or two albums made it on the list, but for the most part this was apparently a year of hip hop and dance music for me. Maybe this just wasn't a good year for rock music, but just as likely, this list reflects the fact that 2010 was sort of a downer of a year, and I was trying to shake off the aura of doom and gloom by listening to music that made me want to shake my proverbial money-maker. Regardless, not many fuzzed out guitars to be found here.
So, onward to the list...
(In alphabetical order)
Aloe Blacc Good Things - "Hey honey, I was just listening to NPR on the drive to the store and heard this really good sounding album..." I'm not sure what it means that I'm getting my music recommendations from Public Radio, but -regardless- this album is a revelation. Somehow he's managed to capture the sound of spirit of early 70's soul music while not sounding cliched or derivative. And, even when he's singing about being scorned by a lover or needing a dollar for some cheap wine, his album makes you feel like you are enjoy a lazy Sunday morning.
Arcade Fire The Suburbs - Unlike Funeral, this album didn't didn't have the "thrill of the new" to it. And, unlike Neon Bible, it didn't have the opportunity to be stuck in a car with Sarah and I as we drove around South Africa for a couple weeks. Still, even an unremarkable Arcade Fire album is better than 90% of what's out there in my book. And, like both previous albums, The Suburbs continues to grow on me even after months of listening.
Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse Dark Night of the Soul - While most of the albums on this list could be described a "feel good" this album is the antithesis of that. A fact that was only driven to home by Mark Linkous' suicide before the albums completion. But, that's not to say that the album is chore to get through, far from it. Instead, its an album for dark nights, rain and wine; an album for recognizing beauty in sorrow and tragedy. It doesn't hurt that, like several other entires on this list, this album features a veritable cornucopia of guest artists, with everyone from the Flaming Lips and James Mercer to Iggy Pop and even David Lynch making appearances.
David Byrne and Fatboy Slim Here Lies Love - Despite my love of all things David Byrne, I have to admit that even I didn't know quite what to make of this album when I first gave it a listen. A two-disk collection of disco and dance songs roughly chronicling the life of Emelda Marcos, that Byrne has been researching and organizing for years. To make matters more surreal, it features a laundry list of famous female singers (including Tori Amos, Cyndi Lauper and Natalie Merchant) plus Byrne and Steve Earl singing the various rolls. But, despite my initial reservations, repeat listening paid off and the album revealed itself to be not just unusual but also a lot of fun. "Solano Avenue" is easily my favorite track of the albums, but "Please Don't" (featuring Santigold) is the main single, and features a video of sorts...
Dessa Badly Broken Code - Oddly, another NPR recommendation. And, almost as surreal, a white, female rapper. Dessa's album inhabits a world where everyone is constantly racing into and trying to escape from self-destructive relationships, but thanks to her nimble rap skills and surprising singing voice, it was a world I found myself revisiting. This song isn't as good as others on the album like, say, "Matches to Paper Dolls" but its got a video, so here ya go...
Gorillaz Plastic Beach - A cartoon bands third album, featuring a not so subtle environmental theme.... yeah, that sounds like it should be a disaster. But, despite that conceit, and despite the fact that it lacks the big singles found on the Gorillaz first two albums, Plastic Beach is possibly the Gorillaz strongest album to date. Without a big name producer to help steer the ship, this Gorillaz outing is definitely Damon Albarn's baby. That said, like the previous two outings, the disk is overflowing with an eccentric array of guest artists: Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Snoop Dogg and Lou Reed amongst others). And, of course, there are the trademarked weird and amazing videos by Jamie Hewlett...
Janelle Monae The Archandroid - When I first heard this album, I was convinced it would be huge in the same way the first Gnarls Barkley CD was. But, while it does seem to have gotten its fair share of love on various critics Top 10 lists this year, it never reached that over-saturated and overplayed level other album did. Probably for the best, I suppose. While other albums on my list lean heavily on guest artists, Janelle takes another route, instead drawing from a huge spectrum of musical influences from the last 30 or so year (ranging from Bowie to Outkast), and somehow jams them together into one cohesive album that lives in a world somewhere halfway between Phillip K. Dick and Metropolis.
Sadly, you can't embed the video for "Tightrope" the featured single, so you'll just have to go here to see Janelle do her thing, in all its pompadoured glory.
Junip Fields - Have you ever been at a party late at night, when everyone's pretty much left, and heard the sound of rock music playing through the walls from some other distant location? Or, have you ever wondered what it would sound like if the Beta Band made 70's folk rock? If you can imagine either of those sounds, you get close to approximating the sound of this Swedish duo. As the parent of a 2-year-old, you grow to appreciate music that is quiet enough that it won't wake your child up from a nap, but upbeat enough to keep you awake yourself. And, while the end of the album flirts with being too jam band-y, one can't deny its hooks and appeal.
Kenye West My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - I thought I had this list all figured out in early December, but then Kanye had to go and release this album. Nominally a concept album in which the artist himself is the concept, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is an overstuffed, Baroque epic that should collapse under its own self-importance. It's self-indulgent, occasionally offensive, and abrasive ...and also pretty incredible and essential listening. In the main single, "Runaway," Kanye urges the listener to raise a toast to the douche bags, assholes and jerk-offs of the world while simultaneously acknowledges himself as one. Well, Kanye, I raise my glass to you.
Mark Ronson & the Business Intl. Record Collection - This is probably my guilty pleasure of the year. This is popcorn fluff of the highest caliber, but it's (I'd argue) also high quality fluff. Apparently Mark Ronson is a wealthy, privileged East Coast producer or something. I'm not too sure, but I do know the album brings a smile to my face and its mix of pop, dance and hip-hop makes me want to dance. Both timeless and soon-to-be-dated. In the album Mark confides that he just wants to be part of our record collection. Well, if I collected records, I would definitely consider it.
So, that's it. My list. I'm sure I'll regret it when I look back on it in a year. It's probably worth mentioning some of my other favorites that almost made the list:
Broken Social Scene Forgiveness Rock Record
Broken Bells Broken Bells
Cee Lo Green The Lady Killer
Charlotte Gainsbourg IRM
The Roots How I Got By
Vampire Weekend Contra
Also, the band (or individual) How To Dress Well was someone who I considered for this list. It sounds like late-80's R&B bounced off the moon and played over a crappy radio. It's an interesting one, and one that I can't help but think will gain some traction in the coming year but, ultimately, the album in its entirety was a little too esoteric. When it works though, it works...
Finally, I'll mention that while the above lists reflect my picks from the 2010 releases, there are a ton of older albums that have been getting a lot of play at the Hill-Stach Manor, including...
The XX The XX
Mos Def The Ecstatic
Basia Bulat Oh, My Darling (Stella's favorite of the year)
The National Boxer
Blue Scholars Hello From Oof
See you next year!
Biking Dry - Today is bike to work day and thus there is no better time to discuss how you can bike on most days without fear of getting wet....or at least very wet. Y...

Macadamia Nuts grow on an evergreen tree that can grow up to 12 meters high which is about 39 feet. Macadamia Nuts can contain either one or two seeds inside of its hard and woody shell. Macadamia Nuts were named that way after a guy named John Macadam. Other names for Macadamia Nuts that you might encounter are like Bush nut, Queensland nut, Queen of nuts, Macadamia, Bauple nut, Boombera, Jindilli, and Gyndl. Macadamia Nuts are native to Australia. Today we can find Macadamia Nuts growing in Hawaii, South Africa, Brazil, California, Costa Rica, Kenya, Bolivia, New Zealand, Colombia, Malawi, and Israel. Macadamia Nuts are considered very Nutritious. Because of the health beneficial ingredients people use Macadamia oil in today’s Cosmetic, Hair, and Skincare products. The Nutrients that we find in a cup or 134 grams of Raw Macadamia Nuts are:

Heading off the plateau today for the long drive to Yarnell. Yet another dentist appointment. One of these weeks/months I should be done. Here’s where I’ll be driving through.
The meadows on the Kaibab Plateau.
Also forest. Watch out for the not-so wildlife.
Drop off the plateau.
Past the Vermilion Cliffs.
Over the river and already went through the woods.
Across the painted desert.
Around Mount Humphreys.
Through Chino Valley where the pronghorns browse.
And home to the Weaver Mountains as the sun goes down.
360 miles. How far do you have to drive to the dentist?
15 Responses to “Going to the dentist, a long drive”
If you are adding the gas $$$$$ to the cost of the dentist $$$$$ you better be getting solid gold teeth installed! Beautiful drive BUT! Stay safe!
Between the hours of driving and the fuel this dental process is getting way too expensive Geri. But otherwise I’d have to wait until the season’s over, which may not be until mid-November.
Thirty miles round-trip to my dentist. Scenery not one iota as fantastic as yours!
Jeannelle recently posted..Chopping Corn
Well Jeannelle, I’d rather drive a shorter ways then settle with the lack of scenery.
Oh gosh — at least it’s beautiful scenery. My hope is that you feel OK to navigate the trip back. It’s a bit of a nasty commute no matter how gorgeous. (PS: I sure wish Typepad had the ‘please confirm you’re human’ button available. Just deleted 50 spams.)
Sallie (FullTime-Life) recently posted..GLAD … it’s summer
Er, I’d have to drive 625m here in EA. With nothing as lovely as your scenery to take my mind off the long trip and ultimate destination. At least we get to share this beautiful country of yours although for you it’s a painful process. Hope you’re feeling better and that the end of the dentistry is in sight, Gaelyn. (((Hugs))) Jo
Honestly — I’ve driven that route so many times in my life I thought I was driving it again. So pretty. And – I go one miles. So you beat me. I was suppose to have surgery this morning but it got delayed until December so the insurance would pick it up. The games we have to play.
RoeH recently posted..Montezuma Well
Wow, that’s quite a drive for your dental visit. I hope he’s doing good work for you. Will be nice to get it all done.
At least the drive is incredibly scenic.
I gotta say…..that’s a beautiful trek:) Hope your dentist visits slowly dissipate. You’ve gone a lot over the past several months. My Russian dentist is 40 minutes away. And she hurts me.
That is dedication to your chompers! Mine is about 2 miles away…and I still hate going.
Candace recently posted..Saved
That is a long way to go to the dentist but at least most of it is an amazingly beautiful drive. Now that we have been there I take delight in looking at your images and saying to myself “I know where that is!”
Martha Z recently posted..Moonrise at Mono Lake
Yikes, Gaelyn – I thought the 90 miles to Denver was bad! I’m still dealing with mine, too. Good luck – hope this is it for you. I still haven’t even gotten measured for the crown.
Barb recently posted..Random Thoughts – Summer Dreaming
Trying to fix the scenery in your mind on the way to the dentist is a good way to later relax on the chair…
And I thought we had to drive far to find snow…. It may be far but the route has such an amazing veriety of sceneries. A beautiful part of the world you live in

The scenery en route to the dentist would almost make it worthwhile! How far to Algodones from Port Townsend?….Maybe 1400 miles! Ours will have to wait till winter…

The Whipping Tree
From the personal collection of M. Jones, the owner of this blog.
From the personal collection of F. Mathis, owner of MyNolaHeritage
The pictures are from my trip to Savannah, GA this past weekend where I met geneabuds Luckie Daniels, Felicia Mathis, and Sandra Taliaferro. The dark marks that you see on the trees are a present day reminder of the brutality of the chattel slavery system. They are where the leather whip that was used to "discipline" a slave sliced into the bark of the tree as well as the skin.
What a terrible reminder of what some of our ancestors endured.
Mavis,
What Kathleen said is so true; it's a terrible reminder. It is one of my most treasured photos from the trip. Viewing the tree was a very emotional experience.
San
Out of all the sightings this past weekend, this one cut me the deepest. Why I cannot tell you, but I literally could not lift the camera to snap the shot.
I am so glad that you and Felicia did. This is an image that though painful, cannot be forgotten.
Luckie.

First let's look at Georgia's remaining schedule, the records of those teams, and associated RPIs for each team (from realtimerpi.com):
Keep in mind, Georgia's current RPI is in the 250 range. Based on that, we should be favored in one game (Florida A&M) based solely on schedule. We get a break in that our two most winnable games in conference, Auburn and Mississippi State, are at home. We should be favored in those two due to home court advantage. Also, we've always seemed to come up with one performance against a very good team (think Florida last season) and win a game we have no business winning.
If you are doing the math at home, that is 7 wins and 24 losses. Since this is the simplest way to look at a median number of wins, I'm ok with calling this our expected number and go with 7-24.
What about the upside?
Realistically, we cannot be expected to beat Florida either time this year. Same goes for Texas A&M or Alabama. For that matter, the only road games we should be anywhere close to being competitive in would be South Carolina and Vandy. Furthermore, any home game against a team with a sub 100 RPI would be a huge upset. I'm willing to say we can win one of USC (not likely, but possible) and George Washington (who has struggled recently and also lost to Youngstown State).
That leaves Florida A&M, one of George Washington/USC, Mississippi State, Auburn, South Carolina at home, one of South Carolina/Vandy on the road, and that one crazy game that we always have at home where we slip up and surprise someone. For good measure let's say we have two of those games. That is 11-20.
Isn't 7-24 the downside?
God no. We could go 1-17 in the conference and only win one of the remaining OOC games. That'd be a gut wrenching 5-26. For that matter, we could go 0-18 in the conference if Fox loses the team. The SEC, while far from being as good as it has been in some years is much better than it has been. Furthermore, Georgia's schedule, looking forward, is very tough. We get four of the top five RPI teams in the conference twice. We only play one of the other bottom feeders (South Carolina) twice.
Like I said earlier, the only thing that gives me any hope for better than 10 wins is somehow the younger lineup starts to gel and we find some offense to go with the plodding game pace. You can complain about the pace of the game, but we aren't going to win
Then the question then becomes is 14-17 good enough for Fox to keep his job?

I think it's a 10-21 season. Upside is 13 games. We will play better with the 3 fr starting.
The downside depends on KCp's health.
Meh. It's basketball. Fire Fox or whatever. Nobody really cares. Isn't there a bowl game coming up?.

CyberSource, the largest Fraud Prevention and eCommerce Transaction Security company in the world, was extending their footprint into the Asia Pacific region. In light of this, the Visa subsidiary wanted to generate more APAC leads. CyberSource already had an established traditional marketing system which involved direct mailers, events and database marketing. What they needed was a solution that would not only provide them with valuable leads but would also take their marketing beyond traditional methods.
Our solution involved using CyberSource's existing content and re-purposing them creatively. Tapping CyberSource's industry reports, we developed a rapid survey solution called a "Pulse Survey". The interactive survey is web-based and device-independent. As potential leads answer the 5-minute survey, they can immediately see detailed analysis based on their answers. And if they wanted to have an offline copy of the complete survey report, all they have to do was provide basic information like name and email.
Aside from being used as an effective online tool for lead generation, CyberSource also uses the "Pulse Survey" at events where booth assistants directly engage leads using mobile devices. As potential leads answer the survey questions, the detailed analysis that they get gives them an on-the-spot snapshot of how their company is benchmarked against the industry. The real time information that they glean from the survey gives prospects valuable and actionable insight. The immediate nature of this rapid survey solution has proven to be very effective in achieving better conversion rates. Online forms that are not powered by good and enticing content usually deter prospects from converting. Through a solution that offers something of value first (automatic analysis, instant benchmarking) before asking for contact information, CyberSource is able to net more high quality leads.

I have been gone for a very very long time I know. My camera broke. One minute I was taking photos of food and the next it just wouldn’t switch on again. Then I was in Maputo working for a couple of weeks. And then and then and then… Now I am left with a broken camera and an empty bank account. Any camera donations will be greatly appreciated. A Canon Powershot G10 wouldn’t go amiss…
Anyway… I recently spent a weekend in Dundee checking out Vaughn and Neil’s public art project as part of Two Thousand and Ten Reasons to Live in a Small Town. We were all staying on a farm just out of town and Vaughn cooked us dinner. I borrowed his camera and took some pics. They are not of the usual standard I’m afraid, but they still give you an idea of the deliciousness of it all.
Ingredients
- 2kgs baby potatoes
- a few sprigs of rosemary
- 4 sliced cloves of wild garlic
- 2 packs of calamata olives
- 2 rounds of feta
- 100g mixed roasted seeds
- olive oil, salt and pepper
Put the potatoes into a roasting dish and douse with olive oil. Take the pips out of the olives and mix through the potatoes. Strip the rosemary from their stalks, and slice the garlic and mix through the potatoes and olives. Add salt and pepper and mix everything through with your hands, rubbing all the flavour into the potatoes. Roast in an oven of around 180 degrees until the potatoes are crisping nicely on the outside, but soft on the inside. Dry roast the seeds and mix through. Crumble the feta and mix through gently. Serve with a green salad, such as the Baby spinach, roast sweetcorn, asparagus, almond and parmesan salad that Vaughn served for this meal.
Vegan version: remove the feta

Yummy! Will make before the year is out! Welcome back!

Homeschooling while holding a job?
This is not an official GE post, but more of a request for a column I'm writing for USA Today on homeschooling. I would love to talk with a parent who homeschooled a child while holding a job (working from home/self-employed is OK, as long as it was a "real" reasonable money-making enterprise). Please let me know if you'd be willing to be interviewed. Thanks!

Hi, I'm Annie. Not sure if I'm quite what you are looking for. My husband and I run our small computer company from home, and I homeschool our two oldest sons (7 and 5). We basically provide all the tech support small professional offices need without the cost of hiring a full time tech staff. My husband goes to the various offices to the computer work. I handle the business side of things from home. If you want to see more about the homeschooling side of things, look at. If we are what you are looking for, feel free to contact me.
Annie- I would love to talk to you. Blogger doesn't record your email for me, and it isn't readily available from your website (I guessed at one possible address). Can you please email me directly at lvanderkam at yahoo dot com? Thanks so much.
My husband and I are homeschooling a 10yo while both working full time. It's actually been much easier than I anticipated. Feel free to contact me if you want. mmulder at triad.rr.com .
Just started homeschooling, while trying to negotiate with the school to get my 13 y.o. son tutored/reimbursement for online CTY courses (or similar).
I'm a freelance copywriter and sole support for the family. It's not easy, and I'd REALLY appreciate a support group of single parents doing schooling on their own.
Once you've made contact with others, would it be possible for you to ask to share their email...as I'd like to form a group.
I work full time for an internet company and homeschool 5 kids.
Feel free to email me if you want to know more. . .

Closed captioning is a technology that’s been around for a few decades, but it’s changed very little since then. The techniques and processes behind the scenes are even still roughly the same as they were in the beginning. Some Canadians have been complaining that the quality of their captions are even worse than those in the United States.
But no matter how you look at it: Captioning Sucks. Yep, and it needs to be improved; especially with new media. It’s still embarrassing on DVD, too! And HDTV captions aren’t much better. The technology is slow, clunky, limited in the number of fonts, accuracy is sometimes lacking – if they even bother at all (some media companies and broadcasters just don’t care).
There is one company that I think is trying to help and make a difference – Apple, of course! They do have a long way to go, but they’re doing their best to encourage movie companies to put captions on their iTunes-hosted movies (not that the movie companies care enough to actually do so).
When I downloaded the WWDC session videos from 2007, I noticed that they’ve added captions (the transcription is bad, but it’s a start). Horray!
Anyway, I wanted to give a shout out to Apple, and encourage them to keep improving in this area… and to point everyone to the Captioning Sucks website, so that we can pressure those companies to improve captioning for the hearing impaired.
Someone should tell them Comic Sans sucks worse.

Every icon has his or her imitators, and while The Daily Show‘s Jon Stewart didn’t invent the concept of snarking at the news in a quasi-reporting format, his influence has had a profound impact not just on the television world, but on web video. And shows.
The people behind ENN are Canadian and have said that ENN is more closely modelled after the Canadian show This Hour Has 22 Minutes, which has been on air since 1993. With that said I’m sure lots of other influences have made their mark, like The Daily Show or The Onion News Network.
Wow, that Bri Holt guy is super handsome and smart. I would totally sleep with him and I advise all other attractive females to do the same.
Uhhhhh … you might want to fix that typo.
Walter Cronkike? Huh?
(And yes, ENN is an amalgam heavily influenced by 22 Minutes. I’m Jerry Boyle! If you can mark an “X”, you’re MY KIND OF PEOPLE!)
Fixed that typo, ENN, thanks!

Great idea. Video is a perfect way for people to share exactly what is going on. I used video to solve a problem with Comcast suport via QIK video back in 2008:
Micheal dell is an innovator, he sure knows how to take his business to the heights! its an excellent idea. You can actually see the tech you are speaking to..
It occurred to me the other day how ironic it is that the newest social media platform could possibly INCREASE face to face interaction. It seems like the days of people hiding behind a name and picture will eventually be just a memory. Why “chat” when we can “hangout”? It will certainly be interesting to see, especially its implications for B2C interaction. Just a little tidbit about other possible effects of Google+
Indeed. If Facebook was about getting people to show their personality through photos, I think Google+ will be all about getting people to show it directly through video, in a much more realistic way, and also to unite people in groups, which is what “social” is all about.
This spells big trouble for startups which are focused on social media based customer service apps. Google hangout, social networking and search & knowledge management could help solidify its position as a leader in the small business market.
So how do you hangout with the tech guy when your computer has issues? Maybe on your iPad?
That issue crossed my mind too, but I expect it to be less of an issue in the future – Dell are smart here by again demonstrating an innovative use of social media.
As you say, iPads, other computers and eventually smartphones will be great for this sort of customer support in the future – the ability to clearly display the problem and solution will surely make the experience for both parties much smoother.
I like that they are also thinking about group self-help, it’ll be interesting to see what ideas other brands have for using Google+’s features.
I sure look forward to this initiative by Dell.
Although good idea, Dell is going to have to wait, there’s currently no option for google apps for business to be incorporated in google plus (although it’s been promised).
cooperation between Dell with google which is very impressive, hopefully it can make a lot of positive reaction from most customers.
Great for online computer training / product introduction. Sometimes little problems with the computer could be solved easily by a brief talk. Far better than emails.
I believe using “hangout” would be a better option than Facebook Pages – Hangout is fast and easy, in my opinion. All the best Mr. Dell

Hey,
Perfect timing on the contest! I shoot film so the processing and scanning never seem to match up for a entry. Shot this one while doing some bike riding around Denver. I stumbled upon a cool looking plastic chair. I moved it out into the nice spring sun to get a cool shadow snapped the photo and rode off, simple. Shot with Nikon FE2 on Fuji Neopan 100.

This is a photograph of the reservoir that I am near. I took it during the evening where I set up both my Canon 7D and T3i and took numerous shots throughout my time there. I really enjoyed how this one came out, but it called for black and white as the colors were just slightly off. After changing the image to B&W I got an image that I really liked.
The light really wasn't that great for shooting, the sky was colorless and it was too bright for really long exposures. But, I knew I wanted an image that was smooth and clean while still showing the natural movements in nature. I realized I could do this with the help of black and white. At the same time, I wanted to be sure not to catch too much movement from the wind and the geese and ducks (seen moving in the water). To do this I took a series of photos at different intervals. This one brought just enough movement to the photo to keep the rougher nature feel while being quiet and smooth.
ISO: 100
Lens: Sigma 50mm f/2.8 with Canon EF Converter
Shutter Speed: 4/5 sec
Camera Setting: Manual
Editing: Adobe CS6 (beta) — Conversion to B&W from RAW color image, and slight touch ups/changes

I was driving home from work and and saw this statue in front of the Penrose Equestrian Center. The storm clouds behind the statute added some drama to the wild pose of the horse and rider. Wild horses + Cowboys + Afternoon Storm Clouds + Mountains = Quintessential Colorado.
I shot this image in RAW and converted to black and white in post processing. I used a Nikon D3000 with a 50mm NIKKOR 1.8G lens. It was shot with ISO 100, f/5.6, 1/200 sec with a flash to fill in some of the shadows on the dark bronze.

Thanks for the opportunity to participate in this shooting contest, I am a very, very amateur photo enthusiast. This photo is of my 8 month old daughter in our back yard. Since watermelon is just in season we figured we would let her try some out.
Here are some details of the photo:
Camera: Nikon D3100
Lens: AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G
Lighting: Natural Sunlight / Stock Flash
ISO: 280
Lens covers: Close-up x2 Lens with UV Filter

I wanted to get into this week's contest because I love black and white! However my dSLR is under the weather for some unknown reason, and I had to improvise. This was taken with my point and shoot Sony HX5V. f/11.0, 2 second exposure, and ISO 125. 2 external flashes triggered manually w/ a wireless flash.
I've been in a very piano-y mood over the past week and wanted to integrate that interest into my photo. I set up my scene with a few tealights and a couple other candles (off screen) and got shooting! It was kind of fun to try and use external flashes with a point and shoot. Overall, a fun shoot!

Hey,
This photo was taken in my hometown of Mississauga, ON. Photos provide a good way to remembering home when I'm homesick. It being my birthday today, and being away from home, family, friends, is driving me homesick.
Time to scroll through photos.
Cheers.

This shot was taken with a Panasonic DMC-TS3 Point and shoot camera that my family won in Roll up the Rim.
shot on auto from halfway up the branch (nothing too fancy, i did more of the work in photoshop), the file states an ISO speed of 100, 0 step exposure with an exposure time of 1/100. the photo is using photoshop's black and white filter with a minor adjustment on the maximum black preset.
I am a casual photographer who likes to take macro pictures from angles people don't usually notice (maybe a little cliché , but i like the results). when i heard of the contest, i decided to take a walk around with my camera. this shot was taken vertically from halfway up a shrub in my front yard. out of all the 20 or so pictures i took today, this one stood out for me.

Used a Canon EOS Rebel T2i with EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS in Av Mode at 1/500, f/5.6, ISO 100.
This is a handheld capture of one of the many American Crows residing in Santa Monica's Palisades Park. Perched on the stump of a dead palm, he remained almost entirely still for quite some time, shifting his head only slightly to better observe me. I'm pretty sure he was posing. Yeah, he was definitely posing.

5" @ f / 22 (ISO 100)
Montreal's recently redesigned bus station. Because of the classic typeface, I decided to aim for a noir-inspired look. The flares around the headlights/streetlamps are a side effect of a long exposure at a really narrow aperture (f/22).

Shooting Summary:
Camera: Canon Digital Rebel XT
ISO 400
F/13
1/50shutter speed
Standard 18-55mm lens at 22mm zoom
Shot in color, converted in Photoshop to black and white
Story behind the photo:
I took this photo while on vacation with my girlfriends family in Las Vegas last week. Her parents wanted me to take a portrait of all of us in front of our hotel (the Aria, really nice btw!) window that overlooks some of Vegas. However, when setting up the camera on my tripod and getting all the settings correct, I snapped a TEST photo before I set up the timer so I could get in the photo (I am not in this photo). Turned out to be a great "capturing the moment" photo that I really love. You can tell everyone is having a great time (even though we were getting ready to leave) and the overall feel is light and happy. Glad to share it with you guys/gals!

I took the shot In Oakville, Ontario, Canada. My equipment - Canon T3i with an 18-55mm Lens, I followed your steps and used a low ISO and shot in RAW and used Photoshop's Camera RAW 6.6 to edit the exposure, sharpness and most noticeably the tone, saturation and vibrance. The shot came out so mid focused I had no reason to use any post production blurring (this is all straight from the camera)
The shot was actually taken in a park called 16 Mile Creek thats stretched, you guessed it 16 Miles.(this was one of the many steep paths leading down to the creek.)
I had many great shots however this one just looked perfect in Black & White. Most of the other shots looked stunning in over saturated production. If you would like to see more of my photographs check out my instragram account "ryanwattz"
Enjoy

I snagged this 7 shot Black and White HDR of this Porsche 911 GT2 at Festivals of Speed in St. Petersburg, FL 2 weekends ago. Shot with a Canon T2i, 18-55 kit lens, processed in Photomatix, Lightroom and CS4. Thanks.

Tomorrow's Wellness Horoscope for CancerPresented by Horoscope.com
You can benefit tremendously from a physical group activity such as a team that trains together for an athletic event. The group spirit is uplifting for your nature, which has a tendency to be introverted when left alone. And, having a goal can help shape your perspective about life, which can otherwise become obtuse and slightly pessimistic if you aren't careful. Enjoy yourself with friends who are physically active and see what energy comes of it.

Just before Christmas, the new mom was out with her infant and husband Dancy on the streets of New York. Even bundled in an army green parka and hat, she still radiated style and joy.
Winning Ticket9 of 31
The then-pregnant actress glowed at last year's Emmy Awards, winning Best Lead Actress for her role in the hit show Homeland and best dressed for this chartreuse strapless Lanvin gown from 2013's resort collection.
Blue Belle10 of 31
At Showtime's Emmy soiree, Danes elegantly covered her baby bump in a cobalt blue Jason Wu sheath dress with a slightly jeweled neckline and peep-toe heels for a dose of throwback grace.
Work It11 of 31
Danes looked as if she were going undercover while spotted on the streets of New York in workout gear and no makeup last summer.
White Hot12 of 31
At the Met Gala, Danes stunned in a J. Mendel gown embellished with snow white crystals, Christian Louboutin heels and a chic French twist.
Retro Fit13 of 31
Looking like Hollywood royalty at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, the Homeland star wore a curve-hugging silk Vivienne Westwood gown.
High Style14 of 31
In a terracotta Lanvin crinkled shift, statement necklace, and a pompadour (the hairstyle of the moment), Danes looked fashion-forward while sticking to her minimalist mantra.
Pretty in Pink15 of 31
The fuchsia-and-black Narciso Rodriguez dress the actress wore to the Hysteria premiere was vintage Danes: modern, clean, and understated.
Frill Seeker16 of 31
The star garnered much attention at the 2012 Vanity Fair Oscar party in a red Valentino sheer, multi-tiered gown—a departure from her usual streamline silhouettes. Slightly messy hair kept her looking fashion-forward, not fairy-tale princess.
Black Beauty17 of 31
Danes looked effortlessly elegant sitting front row at Narciso Rodriguez's Fall 2012 show, in one of his simple black double-strapped dresses.
City Slicker18 of 31
On the streets of her hometown, Danes was spotted in a fitted black puffer jacket, ankle boots and carrying an oversize orange-and-black striped tote.
Class Act19 of 31
The actress radiated old Hollywood glamour in a sleek black-and-white J. Mendel gown paired with pulled-back hair and a statement red lip at the 69th Golden Globe Awards.
Trace of Lace20 of 31
Decked in a red ruffled and organza Valentino creation, the star celebrated with the iconic designer at his museum launch party.
Work of Art21 of 31
For the 63rd Emmy Awards, Danes donned a blue georgette sequined embroidered gown from Oscar de la Renta's 2012 resort collection.
Gold Rush22 of 31
At the Met Gala in 2011, Danes flexed her fashion chops in a gold metallic Calvin Klein A-line gown and Fred Leighton jewels.
White Nights23 of 31
The queen of minimalism looked pretty and polished in a winter white Calvin Klein dress paired with matching sandals and a silver clutch at the 2011 Vanity Fair Oscar Party.
Flower Power24 of 31
Veering from her sleek, monotone style, Danes was a pleasant surprise in this green floral Louis Vuitton gown embroidered with silk flowers and black pearls at the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards.
Pink Lady25 of 31
Possibly one of her most memorable red carpet moments: a bubblegum pink custom-made Calvin Klein halter gown for the 68th Golden Globes post-party.
Crystal Clear26 of 31
Danes stunned at the 2010 Emmy Awards in a crystal strapless Armani Privé gown with a cascading train.
Nude and Improved27 of 31
Wearing a Zac Posen nude dress with cap sleeves and black lace overlay, Danes kept things sophisticated but romantic at the Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Party back in 2009.
Mad for Plaid28 of 31
Danes' classic, understated choices on the red carpet are also reflected in her street style. Back in 2006, she wore a cozy wool plaid coat and boot-cut jeans.
Red Hot29 of 31
Danes went all out for her turn in The Vagina Monologues in 2001, making a splash in a sharp red dress and matching boa.
Teen Drama30 of 31
While starring in My So-Called Life, Danes already showed a penchant for timeless style.
Eastern Influence31 of 31
That same year, she made a statement in an Asian-inspired evening coat and twisted hair that was all the rage in the '90s.

I live a few steps from the Pacific Ocean and love watching the ocean waves by day and hearing them crash softly in the night. Ocean Beach is a special neighborhood—artsy, funky and a little set back in time, yet timeless. I recently heard someone describe it as “the best little town on earth”… To say it is unique would be an understatement. The ocean is so healing and peaceful; living so close to it definitely brings a constant calmness into your life. I created this illustration to represent all these characteristics and the beauty of my neighborhood, Ocean Beach.
Name: Jenn David Connolly
Place you live: Ocean Beach, San Diego, California
Place your postcard is designed for: Ocean Beach
Occupation: Owner/Designer of Jenn David Design.
Preoccupation: Enjoying the outdoors as much as possible with my kids.
A perfect day? A day filled with many hours spent outdoors having fun in the sun with great friends, a dip in the ocean, followed by the weekly farmers market in the evening and drinks on the porch at sunset.
For the visitor? If someone were visiting Ocean Beach, they should definitely experience the weekly farmers market which is filled with great food, artisan goods, music from local bands, and the community coming together for a weekly celebration of all things good.
A perfect meal? A meal from one of the many great vendors at the farmers market or from the deli at the local co-op.
A little known fact about where you live? There is an annual Christmas Parade that can get pretty wacky!
Where is your favorite place in the world? Right now, it is right here where I live.

1 cup unsweetened dried grated coconut
1 13 ounce can reduced fat evaporated milk
1 13 ounce can reduced fat unsweetened coconut milk *
1 can or plastic squeeze bottle of coconut cream**
Agave syrup or sugar to taste
6 egg yolks
2 T. dark rum, optional
Toast the coconut for about ten minutes or until golden in a pan on the stove or in the oven. Set aside.
Heat the evaporated milk, coconut milk, coconut cream, and agave syrup or sugar in a medium saucepan on the stove until it simmers. (You won’t need much sugar because the coconut cream is very high in sugar.) Do not boil. While this mixture is heating, mix up the egg yolks in a separate bowl. Take 2 cups of the simmering mixture out of the saucepan and add it into the egg yolks, whisking quickly. Now, incorporate the egg yolk-milk mixture back into the simmering milks in the saucepan and bring to a simmer once again or until the back of a metal spoon is coated by the thickened custard. Remove from stove and mix in the rum, if using.
Chill mixture in your refrigerator for at least an hour or two. Pour into ice cream freezer and freeze. Half way through the freezing, add in the toasted coconut.
Makes: Approximately one quart of ice cream.Notes: *I use Trader Joe’s. ** Found in your grocery’s liquor dept.

The long anticipated #604Photowalk number 8 was finally upon us and everyone seemed pretty enthusiastic to get to some fun and friendly photography that day. The weather was cooperating for the most part (at least it didn’t rain!) and I think we all enjoyed being outdoors. So without further adieu, here are some of the sights we saw in and around UBC.
This is what happens when I let a little bit of organizational power go to my head. Dance my minions. DANCE!
Not only is Irv Lau (@irvlau) our administrator in charge of logistics, equipment and general stuff porter and tour guide, he has also become our unofficial model. Very GQ.
One of our goals that day was to catch the cherry blossoms before they disappeared for another year.
I’m glad we did see the the blossoms as they make for some pretty photos. Even though the above photo is anything but in focus, I like the effect the blur gives the shot. It’s almost as if Thomas Tang (@tmasoo) and Irv are casually stepping into another ethereal world.
It was at this point in the day where I decided to become a bit more interactive with the people in my viewfinder. I had heard before that anyone can press the trigger on a camera, but that it takes a certain level of social poking and prodding to uncover a really great “moment” or particularly interesting demeanor from the person you are taking the photo of. Here is Vince Chow (@vincechow)
This photo of Tianna Kwong (@tiannank) is only slightly (and hilariously) marred by the Thomas photobomb. I would have spliced Thomas out, but I think this is a better representation of that memory.
The stylish shoe models of our group.
Yet another photobomb care of Thomas, this time on Cicy Chan (@CicyChan).
Cicy sans the sunglasses.
The usually quite reserved Sukhraj Bhattal (@sukhrajb).
Who can be quite animated given the right circumstances.
Thomas Tang, who was oddly without a camera this time around, should be congratulated for finishing his engineering degree (and for making it back to his car without passing out from food fatigue).
With the camera turned on him this time, the photographic force of nature Nhi Le (@noyophoto) looking svelte and just as comfortable on this side of the lens.
One more photo of Vince sporting his blood donation band-aid.
And in a rare moment of weakness I was thrown in front of the camera myself. Thanks go to Nhi Le for this photo credit.
The ever popular Irv, almost definitely coordinating the world from his phone.
Someone spotted this Banksy-esque stencil of Chomsky in the UBC rose gardens.
A lamp post riddled with stickers from the UBC Museum of Art.
A coyote made an appearance near the tail end of our walk and hardly seemed phased by the presence of so many humans.
Posed and contrived, I couldn’t help but force my will upon the remainder of our group one more time for the above photo. My only hope is that my abuse of power does not end up causing a violent uprising against me. I would like to express my appreciation and thanks to those who made it out to this last #604Photowalk. It was a fun experience and I look forward to seeing you all again soon!

Haha, love the one of me and Thomas! Great summary of our day.
Thank you for the comment and the suggestion about adding share buttons!
Some real good story telling shots from the Photowalk, big boss! And portraits too!! (Gotta love em brick walls)
And thank you for the congratulations and yes, I survived from food fatigue, I’ll bring my camera next time!
Thanks Thomas! If you want bigger, higher res photos then let me know. I’ll send them privately.

Claytons Post #10
A Clayton’s Post (The post you have when you aren’t having a post).
There are 3 things I feel like highlighting today, so without further procrastination…
1) Twinkinfo.com
When the WoWInsider induced storm swept over my blog this week, the most noticeable thing was the absence of comments.
Well near absence…
The one comment that hit my blog, that was a truly valuable comment (directed here, at the guide) was from Drayner.
Now, if you are interested in Twinking a level 19 Warlock, then this probably isn’t a bad place to start. However if you want to twink something else, or want to know more, then I would have to suggest you go pay Drayner a visit… please remember to thank & leave (positive constructive) comments while you are there.
Comments wont make or break a blogger (although some bloggers have broken down in the past under the weight of negative comments), but it sure puts a smile on our face, and spurs us on to do one more post.
2) Dual Spec Relativity
SpicyTunas has a brilliant post up about the relative cost of the forthcoming Dual Spec system. Relative to other optional items in the game that we haven’t blinked an eyelid at.
If you haven’t read it yet, get over there!
PS: Did you know that he uses one of those snazzy blog plugins (that WordPress.com doesn’t have for us freeloaders) that allows you to read his blog on a portable device? While I am thinking about it Saresa at Destructive Reach has just installed a similar plugin (and is running a “competition” too), so be sure to check her blog out from your iPhone or other portable device.
The closest you will get to reading my blog via a snazzy feature like that is to subscribe to it via a feedreader on your phone… the feed should give you the same look & feel.
2) Stabbed in the Iceblock
Mr Euripedes has nothing to say about an upcoming change to Warriors…
Mmm something strange about that?
On maybe two counts…
- He has nothing to say?
- He isn’t a Warrior!
His interest in the change is related more to the unintentional nerf Mages receive rather than to the buff the Warrior.
Of course I particularly like the post not because he is talking amazingly rationally for someone with a Double Critical Q, but because he suggests it’s time to buff Fire Mages…
Gnomer and Out!

Diary of a Dairy Goat. This blog is the diary of one goat, Baby Belle, a Nigerian Dwarf who lives on a small dairy farm in Western Washington.
Thursday, August 20, 2009
Pipe Gate Massage
And that is what happened yesterday.
Not to me, but to my Aunt Hannah Belle.
It was a red letter day. The farm had been rendered spotless. This was because the dairy inspector was coming for a visit. He came right on time and inspected all around the barn.
Even Walker the Talker, the little minimancha buckling who has something to say about everything, had been instructed to keep quiet.
The dairy inspector nodded at everyone in the barn. We nodded back, pretending to admire him. Then he put on a hairnet, which meant he was going into the dairy. The farmer went with him, and they were gone for about five minutes.
While they were gone Aunt Hannah Belle mysteriously appeared. She had been 100% banned from the barn during the inspector's visit, owing to her incorrigible behavior. In fact the farmer had put her down below with the fat girls and mended the little hole in the fence that Melly had made.
"That ought to hold you," the farmer muttered with satisfaction, having woven the field fence back together with an attractively rustic snaggle of baling twine.
Maybe the farmer shouldn't have said that.
We watched in shock and awe as she sashayed down the aisle toward the grain cans. She hannahbelled all three of them in rapid succession, spilling 150 pounds of dry cob and 14% dairy ration onto the barn floor in a seven foot swath.
She ate with lightning speed, like one of those people turned loose in a grocery store for ten minutes. Even Betsy was impressed.
Then for a change of pace she jumped onto my mountain of pea hay, knocking a few bales out of the stack while she searched for hay with the peas still on it. Even Winnie was shaken by her audacity.
A gasp went up as everyone heard the door of the dairy open. Aunt Hannah Belle scuttled away, moving like a worried crab with her feet seeming to rotate underneath her. She ran around the corner toward the pipe gate into the front pasture, and it seemed she had time to make a clean getaway, but then there came a familiar grunting noise.
She was stuck in the gate, too fat to squirt through from the angle she had chosen. Stone cold busted. The dairy inspector, three feet away, popped his eyes in surprise to see a fat little goat teetering between the pipes of the gate.
"What is that?" he said.
"Oh she gets stuck in the fence sometimes," we heard the farmer say nonchalantly. "She is a little bit fat."
"Isn't that cute?' said the dairy inspector.
"Yes," agreed the farmer grimly, looking daggers at Aunt Hannah Belle, who had shrewdly adopted the attitude of someone enjoying a nice relaxing pipe gate massage.
"Well, I better get going," said the dairy inspector. And he turned around and walked in the opposite direction. The farmer took a step into the barn, saw for the first time the hannahbelled cans and the wanton destruction of the one-goat buffet, and smoothly pirouetted back out.
"I'll walk you to your car."

Interesting Times
Also, I thought we lived on a nice cool farm where the main kind of weather would be patchy morning fog. It turns out where we live is actually stifling hot and no one can stop talking about it. Interesting.
People came over and they were saying things like. "Goodness it's hot," or "is it hot enough for you?"
One lady came over and she said, "is it hot enough for you?" and then she laughed and laughed. I guess this is some kind of joke, although I noticed the farmer did not laugh. I think it must be hot enough for anyone, certainly for the farmer.
I have not seen a lot of farmers, really only one, our one that lives here. But I noticed our farmer is somewhat on the round side, and does not seem to like the exceeding hotness we are having, which is predicted to last all week. They are saying that it is going to be 100 degrees in Seattle in the middle of the week.
The farmer's friend came over and told the farmer that even though it was 92 today it was going to be much hotter in the middle of the week. I wondered what the farmer would say and sure enough, just as I would have guessed, the farmer said, "that's interesting."
But with a stony stony stony face.
Hmm, I thought. Interesting.

Atticus Pupicus
Atticus Pupicus is our guardian dog. He used to let all the babies jump on him like a trampoline. But now he doesn't like it any more, those sharp little hooves in the ribs. He has aches and pains now and jumping makes him grumpy. He woofs anybody who jumps on him. Zanegray jumped on him and got woofed.
When he woofs you it really gets your attention.
Oh ok, you say to yourself, maybe I will not jump on you any more. Note to self.
Anyway Atticus Pupicus has been very hot and short-tempered lately because he didn't have his summer haircut. It was blazing hot several days in a row, and Atty lay around panting and gulping water and digging a hole under the porch to try to find more shade.
The farmer had tried to give Atty a haircut, but the clippers died going into the first turn. They were no match for Atty's magnificent dingleberries and his woolly ruff.
Really there was only one person who could help Atty, and that was the kindly neighbor who really knows how to clip and has super industrial sheep shears.
She came over and fixed Atty up. It was not an easy job. And when she was done, they had to get the tractor to take away all the hair.
Atty is in heaven.
His hair is in the tractor bucket.

All The Way or So
My Aunt Hannah Belle had two sons this year and the other day they went to their new home. This left Aunt Hannah Belle with a lot of milk and no one to drink it.
"Come on Hannah Belle," said the farmer meaningfully. "You have been on the dole long enough. It is time for you to go to work."
Hannah Belle kept mum and did not betray anything by her expression. Instead she watched the fat milkers trundling over toward the milk parlor. She could tell by the way Jammies was bobbing and weaving toward the head of the line that there was sure to be food inside.
All right then, Hannah Belle agreed, and when the farmer took her by the collar she marched along docilely. She didn't have any gum so she just chewed her cud, eyeballing the whole operation like she was the regional manager.
"Here is the ramp," the farmer explained. "Go up it when it is your turn, and on the other side you will find a nice buffet of free grain."
All right then, thought Hannah Belle, shrewdly staying out of striking distance of Winnie who likes to t-bone everyone in the waiting room who dares to look her in the eye. As long as they are a lot smaller than she is.
Hannah Belle got in line, choosing a sensible spot near the end. When it came her turn, she went right up the ramp, through the sliding door, and into the milk parlor.
I never saw any of the rest because they closed the door, but I heard it, and so did everybody in the next few counties.
Some of it went like this: "PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN! I MEAN RIGHT NOW! DO NOT DO THAT AGAIN!"
Meanwhile this whole time was a festive sound of hopping, like maybe some leprechauns doing a riverdance in the milk parlor, and in the foreground the loud sucking noise the milk machine makes. Then was followed a series of questions.
"CAN YOU HEAR ME? DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT MACHINE COST? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
Sadly the only answer was more hopping.
Then came a pronouncement: "YOU ARE GOING TO BE MILKED OUT TODAY YOUNG LADY! I MEAN ALL THE WAY!"
Followed by more jolly hopping and then the sound of the exit door sliding open, and then Hannah Belle appeared in view on the down ramp, hair slightly awry but overall I would have to say in an unfazed condition. She proceeded into the barnyard chewing her cud with an air of satisfaction.
I am something of an expert on milk and I did notice that while she had been milked, I would not say that she had been milked out ALL THE WAY.
No one mentioned anything about it and everyone pretended not to notice.

by Jacqueline S. Homan,
author of Without Apology
Combatting the scourge of human trafficking has become the sexy, trendy newest cause for privileged opportunists in need of their newest feel-good activism fix as they seek to profit by wrapping themselves in the cloak of social justice. Of course, those whom are the very core of this cause—the sex trafficking victims (or exited women) themselves—are without real, adequate and appropriate help in terms of income support, medical care, education, job training and job placement to regain control of their destiny to rebuild their lives and live with dignity while trying to do so.
Restoring trafficked women to “normalized” status in society is an important goal, but there is an enormous resistance to that on the part of society, including many “allies” that will not stop their privilege-clinging and power-overing to actually facilitate restoration. Sadly, even most such “allies” look down on adult prostituted women who started out as trafficked under-aged girls.
The very women and girls whom this movement is supposed to be about are exploited for their stories and then discarded and thrown under the bus by most “allies”, including many well-heeled academics who’ve been enriched with chair endowments and many other social prizes and rewards after prostituted/exited women’s stories of tremendous suffering have helped pave the career paths of those who enjoy all the status, prestige and prosperity in the name of “speaking for” downtrodden, marginalized women.
After decades of throwing the poorest, most marginalized women away with misogynistic laws and policies of “benign neglect” tantamount to social Darwinism, everybody suddenly wants to cash in on the big business of helping trafficked women and girls. How odd, considering that it was this very same male supremacist society that threw away poor marginalized women and girls into the prostitute caste in the first place—first by ripping away what meager, inadequate threadbare safety net that did exist for destitute women in the name of “personal responsibility”, and second by continuing to discriminate against women for good-paying blue-collar “men’s jobs” that don’t require an expensive college education, and third by reaffirming male entitlement to women’s bodies as disposable reproductive goods and sex goods.
The Obama administration has unveiled a plan inviting public participation for helping to fight human trafficking, and part of the plan is to open funding for battered women’s shelters whose funding was recently cut by the 2010 Congress. More troubling is that most of these domestic violence shelters refuse to take prostituted women who want to exit but who are also destitute and have nowhere to go. Funding for emergency shelters that turn away trafficked women and under-aged girls is funding that won’t be given to shelters run by anti-trafficking groups that help the trafficked.
Cash-strapped survivor-run and/or secular NGO’s that are geared towards providing real material help to survivors get little to none of the funding from the US Department of Health & Human Services through its Refugee Resettlement Office. Non-profit groups that get the lion’s share of the annual grants from the Office of Refugee Resettlement are nearly all anti-abortion Christian organizations that are huge, deeply entrenched corporations with Catholic Charities and Polaris Project getting the most funds.
This is problematic because faith-based charities refuse to provide abortion care to trafficked women and leave them no choice except to be further physically and psychologically violated by their rapists-johns by forcing them to endure a full term of incapacitating pregnancy and a traumatic, grueling childbirth—thus, continuing the rape and torture. Forcing women to get/remain pregnant against their will when they don’t want to go through it has been the time-honored way that men have oppressed and continue to oppress women, using our vulnerability to pregnancy to keep us from having an equal opportunity to have the same good jobs that are automatically handed to men, denying us full citizenship and equal civil and human rights—which is what fuels the sex trade in the first place because it limits women’s opportunities and rights.
If it’s wrong for women and girls to be sexually exploited, how is it NOT also wrong for them to be reproductively exploited by their “rescuers” for the benefit of Christian adoption agencies and rich, white childless couples who are buying the “right” to further exploit those victims with forced factory-farm reproduction to provide them with babies—free grata?
How does this make them any different than the johns who bought the “right” to first use these girls’ bodies for forced sex to provide him with his precious orgasm?
There is something radically wrong with the system when the non-profit mega corporations (aka “faith-based” charities) that enjoy the backing of well-heeled patriarchal, misogynistic religious powerhouses get all the federal grant money from the US Department of Health & Human Services while cash-strapped secular and survivor-run non-profits started by impoverished exited women who are the real human trafficking experts can’t get funding to help destitute survivors and women who want to exit prostitution but can’t due to nearly insurmountable barriers.
A trafficked teen girl who has no choice becomes that 22 year old drug-addicted woman found in a dumpster with her throat cut from ear to ear because of being thrown away by a bootstrap-happy society that pushed her into the arms of traffickers in the name of “personal responsibility” while refusing to give her real equal opportunities and provide a social floor through which no one can fall.
The Exploitation Continues After Exiting
Now not all men are bad, and neither are all Christians. But the fact remains that the majority are comfortable with the status quo because it privileges them at women’s expense, or else there would NOT be a right-wing War on Women where it is women (especially POOR women) who punished with gratuitous cruelty for men’s sense of entitlement, greed, and debauchery. And there would not be a pandemic of sex trafficking fueled by male demand secured by female poverty and disenfranchisement due to discrimination backed by 6,000 years of institutionalized patriarchy.
People with privilege really don’t want to upset the status quo—it may mean having to relinquish some of their own privileges that come at the expense of the disprivileged. Even within the abolition movement, there is a LOT of privilege-clinging and power-overing.
Exploiting women as sex goods and as reproductive chattel are inseparable. It’s the same end game: objectification, reproductive enslavement, sexual terrorism and cruelty towards women to support male supremacy and male privilege to benefit men at women’s expense, suffering and misery.
Forced pregnancy/childbirth was the main linchpin that upheld the plantation slavery system in the antebellum South. African slave women were forced to breed. All for men’s sexual AND economic benefit at women’s expense and suffering. And even though not all men are porn-consuming, prostitute-abusing pigs, the fact remains that ALL men benefit from this sadistic, exploitative hierarchical system of unearned privileges in which women are kept economically, sexually, and socially oppressed in the ‘one-down’ position. And poor white women (“poor white trash”) have also been convenient throw-aways into the sex class so that men could have a free license to be sexually sadistic predators.
It’s no secret that most who are thrown away into the sex caste are those who either lack class privilege or race privilege or both. Poor men get offered helping hand up and job opportunities that are denied to women; poor women get told to take our clothes off—that being “only a whore” is the ONLY place in society for us, the only “option” if we don’t want to starve or be homeless. Or end up disabled or dead for lack of health care from jobless poverty due to discrimination. This is also how you get so many rescued trafficked women who, out of utter despair, reluctantly return to the traffickers and johns.
Traffickers tell their victims that there is no other place for them, that society won’t accept them and treat them nicely. Unfortunately, the lack of support, help, social acceptance, and a leg up for poor, marginalized exited women faced with no alternative except to return to prostitution gives this credence: Everybody (including many “allies” and “rescuers”) in society proves the traffickers right.
Almost all of the faith-based organizations that get the lion’s share of federal grant money only help a select few kids that make good photo opportunities for their charity’s fundraising PR. What kind of message does this send to trafficked teens and adult women who desperately want to exit prostitution that they were trafficked into before reaching that magical age of 18?
Meanwhile, poor adult women who either have already exited (or who want to exit but feel trapped because they’re physically and/or financially unable to exit) never get anything because there’s this idea that grown women cannot suffer and therefore don’t matter. Adult women are just discarded and written off as having made their “choice.” Almost all anti-trafficking groups focus only on children and ignore the women.
The Cost to Society of Ignoring Poor Prostituted Adult Women
Conservative estimates based on limited data collection place the percentage of sex trafficking victims with HIV at about 25%, but actual numbers may be much higher. According to the Office of the Secretariat of the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS, 63% of HIV-positive sufferers aged 15-24 are women.
A 2007 study published in JAMA showed that 38% of a study group of 287 sex trafficked Nepalese women and girls tested positive for HIV. The study also showed that the younger the trafficked girl, the higher the likelihood of being exposed to HIV since johns specifically request younger girls (under age 15) at brothels and johns often refuse to wear condoms and the prostituted women and girls realistically cannot compel them to.
Many other regions have much higher rates than that, such as Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside where 75% of prostituted women and girls are HIV-positive. Women and children who are trafficked for commercial sex experience a tenfold risk of contracting HIV compared to any other subgroup of the population. The average age of entry into the sex trade for females is 12-14 years of age. The US is one of the top three source and destination hubs for sex trafficking.
According to the US State Department, 80% of human trafficking victims are women and girls, and according to the Harvard School of Public Health study authored by Dr. Jay Silverman, the HIV infection rate exceeded 60% among girls forced into prostitution prior to age 15 from the 2007 sample of 287 Nepalese women and girls. The public health consequence, and ultimately, the devastation to society caused by male demand for commercial sex is astronomical.
“Addressing the widely accepted male demand for commercial sex is critical to ending this modern day form of female slavery,” Silverman said.
As sex trafficking survivor Lisa Bouvet, said: “Saying someone chose to become a prostitute is like saying someone chose to jump off the roof but no one mentioned that the building was on fire.”
Those who manage to exit the sex trade also face a substantial risk of being re-trafficked if they are from a country that lacks adequate social and economic support systems because of the contempt, scorn, derision, neglect and social rejection suffered by the prostituted. Many exited women and girls, out of sheer desperation, re-enter the sex trade when they’re left with nowhere else to go and no real social and economic support because of the criminalization and stigma that comes with being a prostituted woman. And when that happens, chances of being able to re-escape and survive are almost zero.
Many exited women are unable to afford proper medical care and due to total social exclusion and marginalization, they have almost zero employment opportunities and no hope of economically fending for themselves. Almost no one will hire exited women due to the social stigma alone, and finding some middle class Prince Charming to rescue her from utter destitution by marrying her and supporting her so she has a home, food, and medical care is definitely off the table.
As an aside, a study of johns showed that upwards of 60% are married men with families—they bought prostituted women so they could get away with doing to a woman what they would never be able to do to their own wives. If you torture and kill one of the “madonnas”, you will likely get prison; if you torture and kill one of the “whores”, you will likely get a free pass and a pat on the back.
Convicted Child Molesters Get More Social Acceptance and Better Economic Support For Re-entering Society Than Sex Trafficking Survivors
According to Dr. Brian Conway of the University of British Columbia, people who contract HIV—the virus that causes AIDS—can live very, very long and high quality lives without ever developing full blown AIDS as long as their CD4 (white blood cell) count remains well above 200 on medical therapy. But the vast majority of exited women struggle in abject poverty, and in countries like the US and the impoverished regions of Eastern Europe and the Balkans, destitute human trafficking survivors don’t have access to adequate medical treatment or any social income support to be able to live with dignity. Consequently, the sex trafficking survivors who contracted HIV from johns and traffickers are slapped with a cruel, torturous death sentence: slow, painful death from AIDS related complications.
Two major factors that negatively impact CD4 cell count are fatigue and stress. The stress from having to suffer in utter poverty and complete social exclusion due to stigma, compounded by the trauma levels of anyone who survived the amount of violence and torture as prostituted women have, only serves to intensify the agonizing progression of untreated HIV, which is hallmarked by ravaging and unrelenting opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) which causes fatal treatment-resistant pneumonia for which medical intervention does not come cheap.
Untreated HIV is a certain death sentence, but it is a very slow and torturous one that surpasses the level of torture that would be permissible at Guantanamo. Treatment of HIV requires a series of antiretroviral drug therapies, of which there are several classes—each one inhibiting the mutation and multiplication of the HIV virus at different stages of cell invasion in the HIV virus’s life cycle. Often, several classes must be combined to effectively treat this devastating retrovirus which targets CD4 cells, injects healthy CD4 cells with its genetic code (RNA) which is then used by the reverse transcriptase enzyme to build HIV DNA.
The HIV DNA is injected into the CD4 cell’s DNA by the integrase enzyme, establishing HIV infection in the CD4 cell. When the HIV-infected CD4 cell reproduces, the HIV DNA is activated. This is how a retrovirus like HIV destroys the immune system and causes full blown AIDS—by attacking the body’s white blood cells. And this is why multi-faceted therapy drug schedules are needed to treat and subdue or limit the HIV virus’s activity within the body.
None of the current medical technologies for treating HIV can protect an HIV-positive person’s sexual partner from contracting HIV no matter how well the infected person responds to the antiretroviral therapy. So an HIV-positive john with access to good medical care and who is able to improve his healthy CD4 cell count and limit the devastation of HIV in his body, who then turns around and buys rape-on-demand sex from poor prostituted women (and likely refuses to wear a condom) then infects the trafficking victim who is unable to compel him to wear a condom—never mind dictate any other terms and conditions of the sex-for-money transaction. In fact, it is usually in attempting to refuse a particular sexual act that gets prostituted women murdered—if not by the john who wanted to hurt her as part of the “services” he paid for, then by the traffickers in whose eyes a “troublesome” woman’s life isn’t even worth eight cents.
Unlike the traffickers and the johns on sex tourism “vacations” at home and abroad who paid for the “right” to get “you-do-what-I-say” sex from prostituted women and children, poor trafficked and/or exited women that contracted HIV from these self-entitled sexually sadistic men that refused to wear condoms have little to no hope at all of living a long, high quality life if they cannot get proper care due to being from a country in which women do not enjoy equal rights with men, and a country that either does not have the medical technology of antiretroviral therapy available, or that does not provide good medical care to those unable to pay for it because of that country not having universal health care.
To be sentenced to death from full blown AIDS as a direct result of first being forcibly infected with it by cruel, sexually sadistic men that are carriers of HIV and secondly by lack of access to the same quality of medical care to adequately treat HIV that their class-privileged HIV-positive rapists enjoy, meets the definition of torture and crimes against humanity.
In the US, convicted serial killers sentenced to death row get more sympathy and avenues for legal redress and concern for their rights than an adult sex trafficking victim who struggled to exit “the life” against all odds. Regardless of where one stands on the death penalty issue, the fact is that the way the state is permitted to execute a convicted serial killer is restricted by Constitutional laws against cruel and unusual punishment and torture—which is why no one is executed by being drawn and quartered or burned alive at the stake like they were in medieval Europe.
It is also why the state cannot (in theory, anyway) execute someone with biological terrorism, and neither can an individual resort to that under Stand Your Ground Laws. Bioterrorism is precisely what traffickers and johns are doing by deliberately infecting prostituted women with a fatal, incurable STD. Women and children did not enter prostitution with HIV—traffickers and johns infected them with it.
It is a crime against humanity for any other identifiable group to be targeted for death by sexual torture, destitution and bioterrorism—except women. Do the math: 95% of the prostituted are women and girls, 94% of those living below poverty suffering without basic human needs are women and girls. Women comprise 52% of the population yet women have less than 2% of all good-paying blue-collar skilled trades jobs and science careers due to institutionalized sexism and discrimination. Men comprise 88% of the government leadership and lawmaking bodies, and men comprise 98% of the top 1% of the financial elite. Although 5% of the prostituted are boys and men, nearly 100% of the sex buyers are men. Money, privilege and power are gendered. And so is the institution of prostitution.
There are upwards of about 10 million trafficked women and girls trapped in prostitution in the US and only 200 shelter beds nationwide for women and girls who desperately want to exit but cannot. So the final question remains: will destitute exited women get helped with income support to live with a little bit of human dignity while they struggle to heal and rebuild their lives, or will this new anti-trafficking plan by the Obama administration merely serve as a boon for large charity executives? If this country is serious about the sex trafficking problem, then funds for destitute trafficking victims payable to the destitute exited women whether they exited 20 minutes ago or 20 years ago must come first before anyone else’s enrichment. What is needed is: income for destitute exiting/exited women to live with dignity as they try to get on their feet and rebuild their lives, medical care, dental care, therapy, advanced educations and/or vocational training and REAL job placement—guaranteed job slots for poor marginalized exited women.

What I forgot to say yesterday
I remembered later that so many years later, I did do something for Tante Lena.
Tante Lena had no one to remember her when she died. She had no one to continue her line, as the expression goes. There was no one to name a child after her according to tradition. Who would do that?
But I did that. I named my daughter Lauren after Tante Lena. Lauren’s Jewish name is Lea Bela, Tante Lena’s Jewish name.
What a major event I forgot.
And I named my daughter precisely after Tante Lina so that Tante Lena would be remembered for so long as anyone is.
Indian Ocean Update:
A delicate ocean this morning. The horizon is a straight clear line. A band above it, a band as wide-seeming as a wide hair band, is a beautiful light pink, and above that a band of pure whiteness, not identifiable as clouds, and then, above the whiteness, a pale blue clear sky.
Even as I type, the sky above the sea changes its appearance, and the pink band has gone somewhere, I know not where.
Comment
Gloria Dear, we must be related in some way, as your love for the oceans is similar to mine. When I go down the coast (Cairns), I take a detour along the beach and look at my first Love. Love you and next time, lookig at the Ocean think I am at the other side thinking of all of you with Love. Jack

TCU (7-11; 0-7) vs. Oklahoma (15-4; 5-2)
FORT WORTH, Texas - TCU will continue its two-game road swing Wednesday at No. 21 Oklahoma, beginning at 7:00 p.m. from the Lloyd Noble Center. The Horned Frogs will look to record their first conference win this season and eighth overall after falling to Texas Tech in their last outing, 53-42.
Wednesday's showdown will be shown live nationally on Fox Sports Southwest with Chad McKee (Play-By-Play) and former TCU men's coach Billy Tubbs (Color) calling the action live.
The Horned Frogs will look to even the season series after falling earlier this month in Fort Worth, 85-79. TCU and the Sooners will meet for the 17th time in program history Wednesday night.
The OpponentNo. 21 Oklahoma comes into Wednesday with a 15-4 overall record and 5-2 mark in conference play after falling to No. 1 Baylor, 82-65. Against the Bears, the Sooners hit 11 three pointers and were carried on the night by junior Aaryn Ellenberg's season-high 33 points.
On the season, Oklahoma ranks No. 2 in the NCAA in three-point field goal percentage, shooting almost 40 percent from behind the arc. Individually, Ellenberg is averaging 19.7 points per game, while shooting 46 percent from three-point land. Nicole Griffin and Morgan Hook are also averaging double-figures, scoring 10.7 and 10.4 points a contest, respectively.
The SeriesTCU and Oklahoma will meet for the 17th time in program history Wednesday. The Sooners lead the all-time series, 13-3, but the Horned Frogs have won two out of the last six meetings. On Wednesday, the Frogs will look to record their first win in Norman in program history.
Return To SenderJunior Latricia Lovings had a breakout game against Texas Tech, recording a new career-high in blocks with nine. Her nine blocks not only ranked as the fourth-best mark in program history, but it is also tied for the best mark in Big 12 conference play this season with Baylor's Brittney Griner. It currently sits as the second-best block performance in the NCAA this season, trailing only Winthrop's Schaquilla Nunn who posted 10 against Mississippi State in November. Lovings currently ranks No. 3 in the NCAA in blocked shots per game.
Coming Of Age After 18 games, Latricia Lovings has blocked as many shots as she did during the entire 2011-12 campaign, swatting away 68 shots. She has also surpassed her total from a year ago in rebounds. In 30 games a year ago, the junior grabbed a total of 169 rebounds, while this season she has already corralled 184 boards.
More On MedleyZahna Medley has hit the 20-point mark four times this season, which is the most of any freshman in the Big 12. She closed out the first half of the K-State game by scoring 11 of the Frog's final 21 points, then recorded 10 of the team's final 16 in the contest. Medley is the only rookie in the Big 12 to rank in the top 11 in scoring and assists.
Newcomers Making HeadwayDuring a stretch of play against Kansas State at the DMC, freshmen Zahna Medley and Kamy Cole combined to score the last 21 points of the first half for the Purple and White. During conference action, the duo has scored 40 percent of the Frogs scoring. In the last four games alone, Medley and Cole have accounted for 45 percent of the Frogs scoring. In all, the five newcomers have combined to score 70 percent of the Frogs 198 points in the last three outings against Iowa State, West Virginia, Kansas State and Texas Tech.
Keep Her On The CourtSophomore Natalie Ventress, who had not missed a single free throw during conference action prior to the Texas Tech game, has played in a total of 48 games during her short career, starting 46 contests. The Fort Worth native has started 37-straight contests. The last time Ventress didn't start a game was Dec. 20, 2011 against Tulsa. The next closest Horned Frog to start that many consecutive games is junior Latricia Lovings who has started 25-straight.
The Block Party ContinuesJunior Latricia Lovings has become one of the NCAA's elite shot blockers in her short time at TCU. The Fort Worth native now has 157 for her career. The junior, who closed last season ranked No. 25 overall in the NCAA in blocked shots per contest, needs only one more block.
Headlines To Look AtDuring the Jeff Mittie era, the Frogs are 233-33 when leading at the half. TCU is also 136-3 when leading by 10+ at the half.
Overall, when the Frogs score 80+ points in regulation, TCU is 78-2 under Mittie. The Frogs are also 184-18 when the opponent scores 60 or less.
The Last Time OutJunior Latricia Lovings recorded the fourth-most blocks in a single-game in program history Sunday afternoon, but TCU dropped a 53-42 decision to Texas Tech at United Spirit Arena.
In a physical back and fourth game that was a lot closer than the final score indicated, the Horned Frogs cut the Lady Raider lead to seven with 5:14 remaining in the contest, but couldn't complete the comeback despite forcing Texas Tech into 18 turnovers and 33.3 percent from the floor, which is a season-low in conference play.
TCU, who trailed 27-25 at the half after being up by five with two minutes to go in the opening frame, moved to 7-11 overall and 0-7 in league play, while the Lady Raiders improved to 16-4 and 6-2 in conference action. Texas Tech is receiving votes in the AP poll.
On the day, Lovings posted a new career-high nine blocks, while also tallying six points and seven boards.
Donielle Breaux and Zahna Medley led the Frogs on the offensive end of the court Sunday. Both scored nine points apiece, respectively. Sophomore Natalie Ventress followed with eight on 3-of-5 shooting from the field.
Up NextTCU returns home to face Texas Saturday at 11:30 a.m. CT. The game will show live on Fox Sports Net.

MOOSIC – At a time when many small businesses are struggling, Candice Chilek took the leap to reopen Thomas' Barbecue in Moosic, becoming the third generation of her family to run the restaurant.
The Moosic landmark was opened 83 years ago by Chilek's grandmother, Caroline, financed by a low-interest loan of $500.
Over the years, Thomas' Barbecue passed from her grandmother to her Aunt Theda Thomas. In 2003 the long-standing business closed its doors.
With the economy emerging from a severe recession, Chilek reopened the business in 2010 after a seven year hiatus.
Some people advised her not to reopen the restaurant, especially during the tough economy, and she had other options for the property.
"Many other types of business wanted this spot, even a few law offices," Chilek said.
Inspired by her grandmother's drive and perseverance, Chilek pursued her dream.
"We all worked here," she said. "My mom worked here. It was my first job at age 13."
Some renovation was needed, but Chilek kept the original retro themed atmosphere.
"One dining room still has a 1930s-1940s feel to it," she said. "There is a World War II room and a pinup wall."
Even the kitchen still boasts original equipment, including a potato peeler dating back to 1948.
"We still use it all," Chilek said.
But this is not what makes the food taste so good. After watching her family for years make the secret barbecue sauce, Chilek carries on the tradition.
"It is not written down," she said. "When I make the sauce, nobody is allowed to add anything. Nobody."
She goes to great lengths to maintain secrecy. When she goes away on vacation, she will make a pot of sauce for the staff to use until she returns.
Chilek said her grandmother, who lived in Kingston at the time, developed the recipe in her kitchen and began making barbecues to sell.
"Her children would collect orders for barbecues when they went to school," she said.
Her grandfather, a mason, was out of work due to the Depression. They had six children to feed and a mortgage to pay.
"She made her money with 25-cent barbecues and 5-cent Cokes," she said.
What started as just a way to make ends meet grew into a thriving business, and when an affordable property became available, her grandmother purchased it.
"It was formerly a cow pasture," she said.
The original 15-foot-by-15-foot building is now surrounded by years of expansion. Pictures scattered throughout the building show changes over the years, as well as her grandmother, aunt, mother and other family members.
"It is a tribute to my grandmother, mother, and aunt," she said.

Awhile back, I remarked (I do not recall where) that I sometimes give books more of a critical leeway if they are in a genre that does not get as much attention from comics. For instance, I was not a big fan of Love As A Foreign Language, but I admired what J. Torres was trying to do with the comic, so I probably gave it more leeway than I normally would for the same type of story in a different genre. Well, Action Philosophers works in the genre that I personally think comics is severely lacking in, and that is (non auto) biography.
Each issue of Action Philosophers gives the biography of three famous philosophers (the Action Philosophers, as it were). The biographies are done in differing page amounts, some as small as 6 pages, some as long as 14.
So, even if I was not a big fan of the comic, I would have to give them credit for doing something different, expanding comics into a new genre.
However, the comics, themselves, ARE good.
The format of the biographies is, while making the comics as accurate as possible, add comedic elements to the presentation. So presenting Plato as a “wrestling superstar.” Or depicting some of the philosophical conflicts of someone like Saint Augustine as, well, ACTUAL supernatural conflicts. Most of this comes down to Dunleavy, and he is well up to the job. His art has a nice Mike Avon Oeming feel to it. Really nice stuff.
When I was a kid, the school library had these series of biographies of famous people, and the way they attempted to make the agreeable to kids was to open up the books with stories (almost certainly apocryphal) of the famous person as a child, then fast forward to their famous deeds. At the time, I probably enjoyed it (I ended up reading the entire series, so I now know more about John Muir, Cyrus McCormick and Gus Grissom than is probably advisable), but looking back, I think it is a bit of a dirty trick. To tell someone’s history, but FAKE some of it?
That’s fine for entertainment, but it not a great approach for a biograhpy.
Luckily, Van Lente does not do that, but rather, he gives us the truth, just presented in a fun manner.
At times, the writing is noticeably cramped, but that is to be expected, given the format.
I, personally, describe Van Lente’s approach as sort of like those expandable washclothes. They come in these little vials, but then you add water, and WHAMMO, they are a big washcloth!!
Action Philosophers works like that. It is a short story, but by the end of it, without knowing it, WHAMMO, you’ve collected a giant washcloth’s worth of information about the subject. And since the subjects are pretty interesting people (#1 is Plato, Bohidharma and Nietzsche; #2 is Thomas Jefferson, Ayn Rand and Saint Augustine; #3 is Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell), it is nice to know a little bit more about each one of them.
Finally, another thing that I admire about the work is the pretty much neutral point of view. Van Lente is only presenting their ideas, he is not really critiquing them (although he slips a few times). He lets US make of them what we will, and to help this, he recommends a text for each one at the end of the comic, which is a lot of fun. Sorta like how Alan Grant used to recommend texts about anarky…only a lot less pretentious…hehe.
Okay, so now that we know why Action Philosophers is a good comic, we can all sing a traditional Van Lente Day carol,
Here we come a-wassailing
Among the leaves so green;
Here we come a-wand’ring
So fair to be seen.
Love and joy come to you,
And to you your wassail too;
And God bless you and send you
a Happy Van Lente Day
And God send you a Happy Van Lente Day.

The Desert of Maine (Desert Week)
Thursday, 19th June 2008 by James Turnbull
We’re continuing the first annual GSS Desert Week! We’re mostly posting about deserts and it’s lasting about a week!
The 40 acre Desert of Maine is located in a pine forest near the town of Freeport. Although not a real desert, the “sand” is natural to the area: it is glacial silt that would have been ground down under the earth sometime around the last ice age.
The silt would have remained hidden underground if it wasn’t for some poor farming practices in the early 1900s that eroded all the soil. The farmer eventually had to sell up to an enterprising man who correctly assumed tourists would flock to see some sand in the middle of a forest.
Since 1925 up to 30,000 people a year have visited the “desert”, which is made even more exciting by the inclusion of plastic camels. If that wasn’t enough, there is also a “sand museum” where you can see the sand of real deserts donated from around the world… sounds fascinating!
More info on the official website and NY Times.
Thanks to Elliott C. Evans and jon moses.
A SAND MUSEUM !?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
books first flight available to Maine
Gosh, and I thought there was nowhere more exciting than the History of Concrete exhibition
hello this is very off topic but i found a UFO on street view ive mentioned this on this site many times but nobody seems to care.
if your interested it is on 242 chestnut St Manchester New hampshire.
look towards the signal on the street you will see a black shape,then when you go forward its gone these pictures are taken with in seconds so this isnt a plane.
There are signs all over the area touting the “Desert” of Maine.
You should have called it ‘Sand week’, so far you have covered two sandy deserts and two patches of sand. Why not cover some stony, or cold deserts? I want to see some Polar Bears or Alpacas.
@Timothy – fair point! We conceived this idea because lots of people had suggested sandy things to be honest, but see my next post about the Atacama Desert for some stuff that might tide you over till next year’s desert week (which I shall endeavor to ensure has as little sand as possible
)

MIAMI —
A season of destiny, as it had been billed in South Bend after a 12-0 regular season, was no match for a newly-minted dynasty from Tuscaloosa.
The return to glory for Notre Dame, which hasn’t won a national championship since 1988, will have to wait after Alabama dominated the Fighting Irish, 42-14, to claim an historic third title in four years Monday night in the Bowl Championship Series National Championship Game here at a rocking Sun Life Stadium.
With music blaring and celebrities such as rocker Jon Bon Jovi and actor Vince Vaughn roaming a star-packed sideline, the pre-game atmosphere was as electric as anything sport has to offer in what many considered to be the most anticipated match-up in college football history.
But then the Crimson Tide pulled the plug on any real drama right after the opening kickoff.
“We were surprised with how the score ended up, but we knew we would come out and dominate,” said Alabama All-American center Barrett Jones who imposed his will on a Notre Dame defensive front that made a living this season pressuring quarterbacks and stopping the run. “Not to take anything away from Notre Dame, but we really came out and played hard and were successful.”
The Fighting Irish, boasting the No. 1 scoring defense in the country, allowing just 10.3 points a game, won the ceremonial coin flip and elected to kickoff. That was a mistake.
It took veteran Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron and the Alabama offense all of five offensive plays to march 82 yards for the game’s first touchdown, a powerful 20-yard burst by game MVP Eddie Lacy who rushed 20 times for 145 yards.
Six minutes later McCarron hit tight end Michael Williams for a 14-0 lead. Six minutes after that, it was 21-0 when TJ Yeldon plunged in from 1 yard line.
Barely 15 minutes into the game, the optimistic hope of the Irish gave way to a painful reality. Alabama was as good as advertised. Notre Dame was not.
For Alabama, Monday night’s game was a coronation as the Crimson Tide claimed the storied program’s 15th national championship. The only other team in the modern era to win three national championships in four seasons was Nebraska, which won consensus titles in 1994 and 1995 and split a title with Michigan in 1997.
For Notre Dame it was another BCS bowl game collapse. Including appearances in the 2000 and 2006 Fiesta Bowls and the 2007 Sugar Bowl, the Irish are 0-4 in BCS bowl games and have been outscored, 158-57.
Alabama was just clearly better than Notre Dame, adding another national title notch for the SEC conference that now boasts the past seven national champions. Chants of “SEC, SEC,” rose from the ‘Bama fans with two minutes remaining in the game. Many of the Irish fans, however weren’t around to hear it, having already seeing enough.
But for those Notre Dame loyalists who dared peek through their fingers as they were covering the eyes, there was a certain peace in the dismantling. There was nothing to be ashamed of given how far this program progressed this year under head coach Brian Kelly. Sure the Irish were no match for the Tide Monday night. There’s not a team in college football that would have been.
“They were just the better football team today,” Kelly said, “but I loved the way our guys just kept playing.”
The Tide just had too much speed, too much size and too much experience for the Irish to overcome.
As a result of those three things, Notre Dame lost because its they were overmatched at every position on the field, yes, even middle linebacker where Heisman Trophy runner-up Manti Te’o was virtually a non-factor most of the game.
“It was pretty clear,” Kelly said afterward. “(Our defense) had a hard time getting off the field. A lot of that had to do with Alabama.”
Alabama is the blue print for college football greatness under head coach Nick Saban, who became just the fourth coach in college football history to win four national titles. He also coached LSU to a championship in 2003.
“I think it’s really special,” Saban said of the accomplishment. “One of these days when I’m sitting on the side of a hill watching the stream go by, I’ll probably figure it out even more.”
In the meantime, the Irish program learned that while they’re a great team, they have much work to do before they’re the greatest team.
Notre Dame’s next glory day may be on the horizon, but this night, this season and this dynasty has a sweet home in Alabama.

The Dude: Ye Shall Tread Down The Wicked, For They Shall Be Ashes Under the Soles Of Your Feet Turner - a.k.a. "Ash Turner." He finally gets the chance to exact vengeance upon the duke who abandoned his family to poverty when he discovers the peer's secret first marriage.
The Rub: His vengeance unexpectedly winds up hurting the one woman he's come to care for the most.Dream Casting: Rob James-Collier.
The Plot:
Ash: ALL YOUR DUKEDOM ARE BELONG TO ME.
Old Duke: LOL, I'm dying, I don't care!
Margaret: I DO.
Ash: Wow, you're hot. We should date.
Margaret: Wait, what? NO.
Ash: But I respect your mind!
Margaret: No!
Ash: But I'm secretly illiterate and all torn up and angsty over that fact!
Margaret: ... okay!
Richard, Margaret's Asstastic Brother: Hands off my sister!
Ash: Wait, WHAT? ... actually I'm pretty cool with that.
Margaret: Yay!
Ash: But I'm still going to get the dukedom and condemn your brothers to a life of impoverished bastardy. They deserve it, you see, because they picked on my brothers in school and I would do anything to protect my brothers.
Margaret: But that's what I'M doing!
Ash: No no no - trying to protect your brothers is silly and sentimental because your brothers are ignorant and hurtful.
Margaret: ... so are yours!
Ash: Yes but MY brothers get sequels. So as you can clearly see, my problems are more important than yours. Let's get married!
Margaret: No thanks.
Richard: BTW, Margaret, we're only filing for our own legitimacy, not yours, because otherwise we'd lose everything!
Margaret: FUCK THIS NOISE. Take the Dukedom, Ashy! Let's get married!
Ash: HOORAY!
Margaret: ... but you still have to be nice to my brothers.
Ash: Crud.

The Word: The book starts shortly after the hero utterly ruins the heroine's life - and ends up redeeming it, in the process.
The hero, Ash Turner, blames the death of his sister and his brothers' poverty and sufferings on the selfishness of the Duke of Parford and his weak, spoiled sons. When he discovers the Duke secretly married his mistress as a young man years before publicly marrying his current one, Ash gains a twofold vengeance when he exposes the Duke's bigamy to the ecclesiastical courts - it renders the Duke's despised sons illegitimate and unable to inherit, and it leaves Ash (the closest legitimate relative) as the legal heir.
However, the Duke of Parford also has a daughter, Lady Anna Margaret. Thanks to Ash's exposure of her father's first marriage, she was stripped of her title, outcast from society, and abandoned by all her friends. Because of that, Margaret is determined to do whatever she can to help her brothers' quest to convince Parliament to restore their legitimacy. When Ash travels to the Duke's country estate, Margaret stays on in the guise of a nurse to the ailing Duke - partly to protect her father from any attempt on Ash's part to inherit sooner, and partly to spy and gather intel she can pass on to her brothers, to convince Parliament that Mr. Turner is an unfit addition to the House of Lords.
Her plans go awry when Ash spots her and is instantly attracted. An intelligent, intuitive businessman who made a fortune in India, Ash has learned to trust his instincts above anything else. He sees Margaret and immediately intuits that she is a woman of substance, and starts treating her as such as he tries to seduce her.
Ash's method of seduction is clever as well as sweet. There is a twisty, reversed aristocrat-commoner vibe between the two of them. Margaret is accustomed to the life of a peer, and has been raised to believe that names, wealth, and titles are emblematic of one's worth as a person - so she is very disturbed when Ash continues to pursue her and find value in her despite the fact that he knows nothing of her name, family, or history. Because of that, she discovers her own strengths and talents only after losing everything she initially thought was important about herself.
Ash is an equally interesting character. Thanks to a learning disability, he relies on his personality, confidence, and quick wit to conduct business, but at the same time he is taunted by his shortcomings, torn by the belief that his proud, brash face is all he is capable of offering to the world. This increasingly comes into play when he interacts with his university-educated brothers - he paid for their educations in order to make up for the privations they endured as children, but as a result, he feels isolated and inferior around them.
Honestly, the only real problem I had with this novel was the continuation of the revenge plot. As I've stated before in other articles, there is a thin line to walk when writing a vengeful hero or heroine. I mean, most romance novels ultimately tell us that Revenge is Wrong and we should just Forgive and Love Everybody, but it all boils down to how far the hero takes it and why he's pursuing this revenge in the first place. Ultimately, I didn't buy it with Ash:
- He's already wealthy as sin and his brothers are already provided for.
- He doesn't even respect the prestige that comes with a Dukedom ANYWAY, so why is he screwing up so many lives to get one?
- His revenge creates a LOT of collateral damage for people who either didn't hurt him (Margaret and her mother) or only in the most petty of ways (he's essentially ruining Margaret's brothers' lives because they were mean to his bros in HIGH SCHOOL)
- He continues to actively try and ruin the Dalrymple's lives EVEN AFTER HE KNOWS WHO MARGARET IS because he'll just marry Margaret which will totally fix her life because protecting his brothers is an important and righteous man-problem but Margaret protecting her brothers is a weak and sentimental woman-problem.
B+
this was the first romance I've read all the way through in ages, so I definitely enjoyed it. I agree with you about dragging the revenge plot out - but actually my main beef was the complete reversal of the Big Misunderstanding. Ash was so understanding of who she was, which was refreshing (a hero who gives his heroine the benefit of the doubt!), but left me feeling oddly let down.
I think it's because she wrote the book as though the mistaken identity was the major conflict, but it obviously wasn't. If they'd known each other's identities right from the start, I reckon she would have gotten more mileage out of the obstacles they had to overcome to be together. It would have made for some interesting conversations, right?
Her hidden identity did allow for the lovely aristocrat-commonder inversion you talk about, but it was kinda there in their characterisations already with her bastardy and his childhood.
I loved Ash's inner pain with his bros, though :-)

OK, so I realise Gosstronomy has been all quiet on the gestation front this past year. And I know, I owe everyone an explanation. A blogger can’t just disappear into the ethernet and go without saying a word. I have seen the folly of my ways, and I am back asking for forgiveness.
Right, ready? The sad truth is this – I got a real job.
“No!” you say. “Mon dieu.” “Bastarde.” “Oy gevalt.” Well, my parents said “About time” as I set about helping Lonely Planet transform its famed travel guidebooks and figure out ways to allow people to access the same great information on their mobile phones. Yes, I was a high-priced geek who shrunk guidebooks, but I missed my freedom, I missed writing about food, and I missed people like you reading about it. Yes, dammit, YOU were missed.
So after 14 well-paid months, I chucked it all in and went back to food writing. In the middle of the global financial crisis. And I couldn’t be happier.
Yesterday was my first day of freedom, and it was a whole couple of hours before I got a whiff of a Spanish and Portuguese wine tasting by the Spanish Acquisition, Australia’s top distributor of Iberian drops. The tip-off was thanks for Ryan Andrijich, the former food expert on the Australian version of ‘Queer Eye for the Straight Guy’, who’s now doing catering and cooking classes in Melbourne. Thanks Ryan, I owe you one.
So on my first afternoon back, I was at North Fitzroy bowls, sampling from a massive variety of sherry, whites, roses, Cavas and reds. Sausages and lamb cutlets were sizzling on the barbie as small village of sommeliers, bottle shop (liquor store) operators and chefs sampled from the extensive line-up. The Spanish Acquisition crew started us off with a chilled glass of Delgado Zuleto ‘La Goya” Manzanilla sherry, which got the palate going before we net dipped into the classic Spanish sparkling: Cava. Amid a sampling of white and rose sparklings, I was particularly drawn to the 2005 Agusti Torello Mata Brut Reserve, a fruity, yeasty and lively bubbly.
Then it was onto the whites, which were in their element on this hot summer’s day. One of my favourite whites in Albarino, and there was a good selection at hand, but I found myself struggling to find a stunner among the 2006 and 2007 vintages. Instead, I was drawn to a grape I had never heard of, godello. The only way to describe it is as a Spanish alternative to sauvignon blanc, but far more interesting. The 2007 Telmo Rodriguez ‘Gabo do Xil’ , a hand-picked godello from Spain’s Valdeorras region, was fruity, citrusy and had hints of honeydew, and is a great example of an easy-to-quoff wine that still has personality. It’ll ruin that next glass of same-o Marlborough sav blanc forever. On the more seriuos wine front, it was hard to go past the 2006 Remelluri Blanco, a white blend from monastrell, tempranillo and syrah that had subtle oak on the nose with lemon/lime notes, lots of minerality and a tinge of pepperiness on the back palate – and from reading the tasting notes, lots of other things I couldn’t pick up, like pickles. Save this one for your wankiest wine friends; they’ll love it.
I took a time out after downing all of those Cavas and whites in the heat, gorging on the juicy lamb to soak up the alcohol. And since I was having so much fun, time flew (as it does), so I found myself doing a speed tasting session before the Spanish Acquisition folks shut down the free-for-all. What I found were two killer tempranillos among the mix, stating with a 2006 Artadi ‘Vinas de Gain’ that to borrow the words of Mitchell Mcloud (because he said it better) – the owner of Northcote’s new Harvest Wine & Liquor boutique bottlo – was a brilliant mix of morello cherris and cola beans, confected but not sweet. Whatever, it was drinking beautifully. And while Mitchell found the 2002 Traslanzas as good but a bit light-on, I found it to be a beautiful red, with the kind of subtlety I’d be happy to find in more tempranillos. Top stuff.
But just as we thought the fun was over, there was one more highlight in store for us – an impromptu performance from the comedic duo Elbowskin, Enrie and Dave, the stars of “Are We Stupid” in the upcoming Melbourne Comedy Festival. The two sang a quirky, acoutic-guitar pisstake on the humble vine, which started off with “We were gonna write a song for the sommeliers, but it was all wine, wine, wine” and then headed straight to the gutter from there. All I can remember is the use of wine varietals to describe a man who meets a woman, only to discover she’s infected with phylloxera. It was a good laugh, so the Elbowskin boys promised that they’ll send over a link to a video they produced of the song, which I’ll happily share as soon as I get it. “This is only the second time we’ve had a chance to sing it,” said Ernie – guess it’s not every day you get knowing chuckles from wineheads. For now, check out their request to move their MySpace users to Facebook. It’s not G-rated, so if the kids are around, maybe use the headset.

so let’s all learn Taxonomy and Views!
I’ve got this video
right here for you,
it covers Vocabularies
and then Terms too.
It’s great to learn what can be done,
now let’s all go and have some fun,
being addicted to Drupal stuff,
which really isn’t all that tough.
Wow! that’s not something I normally do when writing about some silly Drupal video tutorial designed to help you learn more about Drupal and how Drupal Taxonomy works. But, hey, it was fun!
Yes,it was fun! : )
Great!.
Thanks for the great video.
It would be great to have a video on Context Module. coz i think most people dont realise how effective the module is.
Anyway thanks a gain for the video.
***Note: Chrismas contribution coming your way soon.
Great video!
An intro to context is indeed a very good idea
Here are a few screen casts,if you are interested in the Context module.

Enjoy.
Really enjoyed that video. Provided a great all round summary on taxonomy, which, like you said, can be confusing at first.
I can't quite yet grasp the importance of categorizing lists using Taxonomy versus the CCK Text field.
For instance, in your example you explain how we're limited to how drupal core's taxonomy is able to present categories.. "In in order to present all option terms, check boxes for multiple selection (radio buttons), etc you need to download the content taxonomy." Instead can I just use CCK Text Field and do the same thing?
I am attempting to create a job listing board for my school. So some listings I am categorizing are long but others are shorter.. It sounds like Content Taxonomy I will need for the major stuff but what about small things like (6, 7th 8th grade selection)? When I have a category that has only 3 terms, can I just as easily create a CCK field: text field and go under global settings and type in my 3 terms? So instead of using Taxonomy I'm using the CCK Text Field to categorize..
What are the advantages or disadvantages of using Content Taxonomy versus the plain CCK Fields to organize my categories?
Great video. Thanks for sharing your knowledge/experience.
Helped me out alot with a few things
- didnt know about synonyms
- Never used CCK but experiemented with adding a new content type and field its pretty good.
- Nice to know what some of the other modules that are related are doing...
Matt,
This is a great overview of taxonomy. I especially liked your venture into relevant contributed modules - given the huge number of modules, it's helpful to get some pointers on the important modules to start with.
Thanks,
Micah
You should write a child book on Drupal rimes!
But,..I've got a problem.
When you show turning on the radio buttons or check boxes with a new field using the Content Taxonomy it seemed to automatically collapse the selections from the Taxonomy Vocabulary Terms.. Do you know if there's a setting someplace that controls whether some modules appear collapsed or expanded when you're working on a node edit page?
Thanks again Matt. You're a really good teacher.
Jeffrey
I'm having the same issue. In fact my Taxonomy Vocabulary doesn't disappear at all when adding a Content Taxonomy Field. So I'm left with both the flat list (from the Taxonomy module) and the Content Taxonomy checkbox list I created. One was supposed replace the other.
I've looked everywhere and can't figure out why the Content Taxonomy field didn't replace my vocabulary listing.
I also don't have a collapsible 'Vocabulary' group on create content page.
Anyone got any ideas?
Thanks Matt, that was really helpfull and easy to understand. Everything's clear now!
What is that menu bar at the top of the page that appears around 3:18?
ya it was really fun in it. i got some useful modules there.

Tourism in Ohio reaches $40 billion in total sales, tops pre-recession level
COLUMBUS, Ohio - The Ohio Office of Tourism earlier this month announced that Ohio's tourism economy grew 6.5 percent in 2011 and generated $40 billion in total sales, up from $38 billion in 2010, according to research conducted on behalf of the Ohio Office of Tourism.
Tourism last year generated $2.7 billion in taxes for Ohio - $1.6 billion in state taxes and $1.1 billion in local taxes. This growth in sales helped increase tourism employment to 443,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs with an associated income of $10.6 billion, an increase of 4,000 jobs over 2010.
"About 1 in every 11.5 jobs or 8.7 percent of Ohio's jobs in 2011 were sustained by Ohio's tourism industry," said Amir Eylon, State Tourism Director. "Tourism is a resilient industry with the ability to quickly add new jobs to meet increased demand, which has put it at the forefront of economic recovery."
"These results reinforce the strength of Ohio's tourism industry as an economic driver for our state," said Christiane Schmenk, Director of the Ohio Department of Development. "We are pleased that travelers continue to take advantage of our state's resources and experience Ohio."
More than 36 million visitors who traveled to Ohio in 2011 stayed overnight, an increase of 5 percent from 2010.
"This is a good indicator that Ohio tourism has returned to pre-recession levels and represents very good news for our industry since Ohio's average overnight visitor outspends day travelers by three to one," Eylon said.

Clear your mind! Try not to think of anything! Uh oh, it’s too late – look what popped in there … it’s the Stay-Puft Marshmallow man from Ivan Reitman’s 1984 blockbuster Ghostbusters. It’s a fine image of one of the unlikeliest bad guys in movie history, and it’s on the front cover of issue #17 of the visual effects journal Cinefex. Gracing the back cover is a still from The Last Starfighter, Nick Castle’s sci-fi adventure from the same year. The picture shows the film’s Gun Star spaceship in all its computer-generated glory. Inside we find two articles spanning 72 pages.
- Ghostbusters (article by Adam Eisenberg)
- The Last Starfighter – Imagery Wrought in the Total Forge (article by Peter Sørensen)
When I first saw Ghostbusters in the cinema, back in 1984, I didn’t ‘get’ it. There’s a particular flavour of American SNL humour that doesn’t always survive the journey across the pond to the UK. Plus, the movie had been so hyped, with that infectious Ray Parker Jr song playing endlessly over the radio, that maybe anything was going to be a disappointment.
Or perhaps it was just me because, second time round, I loved Ghostbusters unreservedly, and I’ve loved it ever since. How deliciously spine-chilling, then, to read up afresh on the miracles wrought by visual effects maestro Richard Edlund and his team during the making of this classic supernatural comedy.
Ghostbusters was Edlund’s first assignment after leaving Industrial Light and Magic to take over EEG, formerly operated by Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich. Edlund tells how, after he’d taken hold of the reins, initial negotiations to work on first Dune, then Ridley Scott’s Legend of Darkness (sic) fell through. ‘I was depressed for a week,’ he says. Then, proving the old adage about feast or famine, he ‘was approached to do both 2010 and Ghostbusters just days apart from each other.’
Eisenberg’s coverage of Ghostbusters is a full-featured affair, embracing everything from Edlund’s initial restructuring of EEG – ‘Basically we had to totally change the place’ – through preproduction, location and studio shoots all the way to post and optical. As usual, the article is based on first-hand accounts, but there’s an added breadth here as we get to hear not only from the key effects personnel, but also from a range of other folk including writer/star Dan Aykroyd and producer Michael Gross.
While Aykroyd tells us a little about the origins of the name Gozer, and why he chose to feature a villain made of marshmallow, Gross confesses that ‘the concept of the Stay-Puft man made everyone a little nervous going in.’ We don’t always hear from producers in Cinefex, and Gross’s voice is an especially interesting one here, giving us a wide-angle view on the production as a whole, while still zooming in on the little details.
Another good voice is that of John Bruno, the EEG art director who also storyboarded all the effects scenes. The storyboard artist is something of an unsung hero, so it’s nice to hear Bruno talk in detail about his process. Gross compliments him on the way he ‘created specific illustrations that took into account … what angles were best for the effects,’ and remarks that ‘when the set was finished … we realised that what [John] had boarded many months before was exactly what we were seeing through the camera.’
Ghostbusters might be a hip comedy, but you only have to read Eisenberg’s article to be reminded that it’s also a major effects picture. We get the goods on everything from stop-motion animation to cloud tank photography, animatronics and puppetry to matte paintings. Matthew Yuricich, assisted by Michelle Moen, produced over forty of the latter for the movie. According to Gross, ‘They’re so good I can find only about half of them myself.’
There’s a lot about special effects too: those on-set physical illusions like exploding walls and hydraulically-operated earthquakes. My particular favourite is the eggs that pop out of the box and start frying on Dana Barrett’s kitchen worktop, a live stage effect that involved pre-scoring the shells of real eggs and using compressed air to fire their contents out on to steel tiles preheated with hidden burners.
Every page turn of this article reveals a new effect and a new challenge for the film-makers, so it’s all the more extraordinary to remember that the entire Ghostbusters production was turned around in just a year … and that it still looks amazing. Here’s Richard Edlund’s summary of the experience: ‘Making a big picture like Ghostbusters is like fighting a war … it really is like battlefield conditions.’
Reading old issues of Cinefex in sequence as I am reveals a kind of background story arc to these major effects films – particularly when it comes to the characters involved. By tracking the careers of people like Edlund and Trumbull, we get an insight into how things are constantly changing in this ever-volatile industry.
With Edlund specifically (and I realise this could just be me reading between the lines), I get the impression he was much more content after the move to EEG/Los Angeles than he’d been in the latter years at San Francisco-based ILM. ‘I’m a naturalised Angelino,’ he says. ‘I knew I just wasn’t a Marin County person.’ Moreover, he seems very happy with his work on Ghostbusters, concluding that, even though the film ‘was like doing Poltergeist and Raiders together, in half the time … ultimately, I think, we pulled it off.’ Upbeat words from a man who, back in Cinefex #2, rated his work on The Empire Strikes Back at a rather disappointing 6.5 out of 10.
On the subject of story arcs, by far the most significant one in the 80s and 90s is, of course, the steady emergence of digital technology. If Ghostbusters is a hectic lightning storm spewing out the very best in optical and mechanical effects, The Last Starfighter shines with the pure, clean light of the laser-sharp cutting edge. At the same time, it’s worth noting that, like Tron before it, The Last Starfighter has a storyline in which video games play a key role, in part justifying the use of CG effects … and perhaps excusing any shortcomings those effects might have.
The Starfighter article is written by Peter Sørensen, the man responsible for several previous Cinefex pieces on computer generated imagery. Once again, he offers us what is now a fascinating snapshot of the state of the art circa 1984. Back then there were no desktop PCs, and an outfit that wanted to crunch the kinds of numbers needed to make photo-real images had only one option: buy themselves a Cray X-MP supercomputer.
The outfit in question was Digital Productions, a breakaway from Triple-I, operated by John Whitney Jr and Gary Demos. Sørensen is in his elements as he reels off the specifications of their monstrous number-cruncher, which was ‘absolutely jam-packed with 200,000 special microchips’ and needed a liquid freon cooling system to keep the temperature down on its monumental 100,000 watts of power.
In modern-day parlance, the Cray was to all intents and purposes a self-contained render farm, running software that took its instructions from a lesser VAX 11/780 workstation and churned the necessary thousands of individual movie frame images. The VAX, by all accounts, wasn’t as user-friendly as a modern system, especially when it came to creating the model spacecraft needed for The Last Starfighter.
‘Objects are first drawn on paper in a manner similar to that of engineering blueprints,’ Sørensen explains. ‘The drawing is then placed on an “encoding table” to be “digitized”.’ A lot of this article is devoted to the intricacies of these and other processes, many of which seem quaint and clunky today. All the same, it’s clear they form the basis of everything that’s happened in the discipline since. The only thing that’s really changed is the processing power available and the sophistication of the computer interfaces. Even by 1984, the basics of geometric manipulation, mapping and rendering were all well and truly in place.
When all the technological jargon gets too much, concept artist Ron Cobb is on hand to give it that human touch. Talking about his inspirations for the various vehicle designs, Cobb tells how he combined what he describes as ‘Spitfires in space … a kind of Star Wars thing that’s becoming a bit of a cliche’ with ‘some of the crazy faddishness from the attack of the killer helicopters – Blue Thunder.’ I was interested to read how Cobb drew inspiration from real-world developments reported in Aviation Week and NASA reports, and amazed to learn that he was ‘able to envision designs so clearly in his head that he skips the sketching stage … and confidently makes blueprint-like drawings right off the bat.’
It’s fun to read about the various glitches all these new techniques, including the moment when the operators forgot to use the appropriate computer commands, resulting in a randomly-coloured Gun Star that ‘came out looking like a black-light “flower power” spaceship.’
You can also sense the excitement – and frustration – that came from working with systems that promised so much, but were not yet perfected. Director Nick Castle cites the big advantage of working digitally as the ability ‘to do everything in one pass … that saves you the loss of several generations, which is great in terms of look.’ But some of the new tricks he wanted to try, like scanning the face of actor Lance Guest on to his computer-generated counterpart, remained tantalisingly out of reach. ‘There were time problems,’ Castle laments.
This frustration is evident in Sørensen’s somewhat evangelical text as he lapses something that occurs only rarely in Cinefex: editorial comment. ‘Perhaps the major problem with The Last Starfighter,’ he states, ‘is the fact that the imagery still suffers at times from the overly clean, surrealistic-reality problem.’ But he ends on a positive note, asserting that, ‘Those problems could have been overcome if there had been a little more time to dote on details.’
More interesting to me were Ron Cobb’s closing remarks about the impact of computers on, well, everything … and in particular the uncertainy that still surrounded the new technology. ‘I think there’s a real need for the culture to grab ahold of this technology,’ he says. ‘To most people, computer graphics is a detached, alien technology … It’s a shame if that persists.’
It’s worth noting, however, that Cobb was clearly in awe of the Cray, saying that it ‘reminded him of the monolith in 2001.’ His remarks remind us that these were the frontier days when computers, in the minds of most people, were still magical things. What better place then than Hollywood, that fabled western land of the American Dream, to make the magic real?
There are oodles of behind-the-scenes photos in the Ghostbusters article, including some hilarious shots of Mark Wilson and a team of puppeteers performing Onionhead (AKA Slimer) on the EEG stage. My favourite image, however, shows Bill Bryan’s head and shoulders poking out of the top of the Stay-Puft suit, while the marshmallow man’s detached foam rubber face sits grinning in the foreground.
When it comes to The Last Starfighter, there are plenty of frame blow-ups demonstrating the slick quality of the Digital Productions CGI images. To the modern eye, they have that pristine computer-game look that betrays their origins, but there’s no doubt that, for the time, they were damned impressive. In a photograph that shows the reality of working with 1980s computer technology, Kevin Rafferty is shown poring over his encoding table with a pair of hand-held cursor devices, painstakingly converting detailed blueprints into digital assets.
Thanks again for another fine entry.
Cinefex 17 has always been a personal favorite, largely because of my enduring fondness for “Ghostbusters,” which, as a film and a cultural touchstone, has certainly stood the test of time, but also for our coverage of the deservedly less memorable, though perhaps more historically significant “The Last Starfighter,” which was an important milestone in the evolution of computer generated imagery.
The inclusion of producer Michael Gross in the “Ghostbusters” article may have been unusual for Cinefex, but since he was responsible for production oversight on the film’s visual effects, it made perfect sense to include his well-informed voice. And we had a personal connection. Michael and I grew up in the same town and have been close friends since high school, when he and I and other like-minded pals made amateur movies together. Michael was always an extraordinary artist and designer, and prior to his film career, was, among other things, art director of National Lampoon during its heyday. (His “If You Don’t Buy This Magazine, We’ll Kill This Dog” cover is invariably ranked among the best magazine covers ever.)
By way of my relationship with Michael, I played a small part in “Ghostbusters’” early development. Director Ivan Reitman was a master of film comedy, but he had never done a visual effects film – and this was going to be a big one – so Michael called me in for some consultation early on. My major (perhaps only) contribution was putting the filmmakers in touch with Richard Edlund. I knew that Richard was planning to leave ILM to set up his own effects studio, but, to the best of my recollection, it was not common knowledge at the time. I arranged a meeting with Ivan and Michael and Richard that led to their collaboration on “Ghostbusters” – which happily worked out very well for all concerned.
Thanks for dropping by, Don, and for adding your own memories to this blog. I’m sure I’m not the only person fascinated to learn of your matchmaking role in the early days of Ghostbusters! I agree that both Ghostbusters and The Last Starfighter were touchstone movies, in very different ways, which does indeed make this a particularly memorable issue.
“My favourite image, however, shows Bill Bryan’s head and shoulders poking out of the top of the Stay-Puft suit, while the marshmallow man’s detached foam rubber face sits grinning in the foreground.”
Funny, that, and the front cover are my favorites, too.
Hey Bill. I never thought the Stay-Puft marshmallow man would be posting a comment on my blog. Thanks for reading. I hope those pesky proton packs didn’t leave too many scars! Cheers, Graham

Some Minnesota legislators are introducing a "complete streets" bill that would design and build roads "right the first time" for multiple users, instead of exclusively for moving vehicles.
Winter helps illustrate the idea that pedestrian- and bike-friendly streets also work for cars, especially when heavy snow and ice build up around the city.
It's obvious that streets without icy intersections are safer for stopping vehicles as well as for pedestrians making their way across them. Likewise, streets cleared curb to curb create safer passing zones and bike lanes, leave better, more consistent parking zones.
It works the other way, too. If the emphasis is on clearing just enough for vehicles, cyclists must ride in the main lane or follow an unpredictable path.
On my ride downtown today, I stuck mainly to major streets and the riding was decent.
The worst spots were created by street parking that had impeded plows and by taxpayers who cleaned their own driveways by moving the snow into the streets after the plows had gone through.
In other words, wherever car owners treated the street as their exclusive domain.

Day 23: Youth In Revolt (2009)
R, 1 hr. 30 min. Directed by: Miguel Arteta. Release Date: January 8, 2010. DVD Release Date: June 15, 2010.
It's probably a good thing that Michael Cera found this niche acting job market, because otherwise he'd be totally screwed. My concern is what's going to happen when he's obviously NOT 16 (as opposed to being only somewhat not obviously 16). The good news is that he's pretty funny in Youth In Revolt. I don't always like Cera, in fact I think other than Scott Pilgrim v. The World, and Juno, I haven't liked him in anything. I also liked Zach Galifianakis in this movie and I don't like him in ANYTHING.
Youth In Revolt is your basic coming-of-age film with a few twists that aren't totally unique. It's all about that first flush of romance and the pull of first love. As a species, humans are never dumber than when we're in that moment of our lives, and Youth is a testament to that stupidity. What is unique is that this movie wasn't set as far back in the past as I had thought (based on the clothes of the cast members). My clue was the purchase of a dog with a "Subway card with four stickers on it." It's also unique that this coming-of-age movie is funny. Ridiculously so. There are one-liners and situations that are so hysterical that if they aren't being freely quoted on the internet, they should be. Justin Long bumps this up just a bit and I regret that his part wasn't a bit bigger. But the man does do a good cameo.
The multi-personality creation between Nick and Francois is brilliant. I especially like that regardless of which is talking or moving around, there's no change in perspective on the part of the rest of the cast. Although what self-respecting modern teenager would create an alter ego that wore white sansabelt pants and a blue button down linen shirt? Don't get me started on the mustache.
If this movie has a fault, it's that none of the cast of characters feel real in something other than fits and starts. It's not that this keeps the movie from being funny, but it takes the story from being funny because these things could happen to funny because of how ludicrous these people are.

I've worked here for over a year and to date have had no annual review; there are numerous problems with this agency which have caused me to give my resignation. All of the "directors" should be let go and an entire new leadership brought in. The current leadership is more focused on media/public image than they are on the fundamentals of care for the clients or the rest of their employees. This is the worst place I have ever worked and the only way for it to get better is to totally revamp it with the focus on the clients, better treatment of the employees and a more balanced pay system. The Executive Director's salary is literally 10 times that of mine, and last year rather than taking a pay cut himself he laid people off.

The Best Thing about a Postal Strike
Is that all your packages arrive at once! Here at last is my Fall Felted Bag from my partner Penny
Here's the HUGE bag she made for me and it's full of goodies! Question is, will my laptop fit inside?
You bet it will and Penny has sewn in an extra pocket on the inside which is exactly the right size for the mouse! Well done Penny, it's a really great, useful bag, thanks a million. But wait, Penny sent more...
The dark yarn you can't quite see is Hacho 100% Merino which is SO soft, Regia Bamboo and a thick single from DuraSport with some Canadian Kool-Aid for dyeing with. How fabulous is this? But wait there's more...
Clods (apparently addictive so I haven't opened them yet!) Cadbury's Dark Chocolate and some handcream(Penny, how did you know I had just finished my last tube?) And a really pretty beaded bag - isn't this lovely? Inside is a necklace and a pair of earrings which are beautiful but can I take a decent picture of them? No of course not. I'll keep trying though as you deserve to see them - they're great.
So thanks to my new friend in Canada who sent me a wonderful package that was definitely worth the wait. I love it all and don't worry I won't be giving any of it away Penny!!
Oh yeah, the worst thing about a Postal Strike? Is people who buy something from you on eBay (or via your website) in the middle of a Postal Strike and then complain that their parcel hasn't arrived..... Messages vary from ' bk not arrvd...problem? thnx' (I kid you not, people really do use text language to complain.) to the longwinded letter of meticulous complaint spanning several paragraphs. It's been impossible not to write sarcastic replies beginning with 'Yes, there's a problem - it's called a Postal Strike, it's beyond my control.' or ' You may not be aware but we have been having a series of Postal Strikes.....' I'm at the end of my tether with them and I don't think I can bear to write anymore replies.
Off to try and finish my Tilted Duster....

I am glad your package finally arrived. I didn't know there was a postal strike until you wrote it on your blog. Glad the lap top fit in the bag. Guess the heavy piece I put in the bottom of the bag will work out if you are going to use the bag for your laptop. My exchange bag should be arriving anytime now and I am ansy with anticipation.
Wow - great swap! Love the bag - how nice that your laptop fits. Hope the postal strike ends soon!
My package arrived today, and it's GORGEOUS! Thank you, details are being posted on my blog now...
And there is another connection here....
Those people need to just shut the fuck up! Who complains about an item not arriving when there's a bloody postal strike?! Idjits.
Pardon my language.
Love your new bag!! :)

Our play. It was amazing because each drawing I made changed into a three-dimensional object. Hot glass is beautiful and has an amazing red glow…and the way the colors are added is wonderful. The object is created very quickly and cools for days. I was thinking of making containers and vases for flowers or some brew. I wish I thought about the practical aspects more…like how do you hold a flying cup? Or do you spill or even get hurt when your pitcher has pointy ears?
Now I know I will not compete with professional glassmakers! And I appreciate how much work it takes to make something complex and beautiful. And I had fun. Also, the Corning Museum—and the history of glass—is amazing. You should visit! Happy summer.”

Felix gives a thumbs up after playing catch
Felix Hernandez played catch and did his normal stretching with the team before tonight’s game in Anaheim and gave a big thumbs up and “bueno” to manager Eric Wedge as he left the field, which should be a good sign for his ability to return to the rotation by this weekend.
Hernandez, who tweaked his back in his last start Friday in Chicago, will throw again Thursday when the team returns to Seattle and a decision will made Friday on his next start. Wedge said the best-case scenario would be a Sunday start against the Dodgers.
But if there is any uncertainty, he’ll be held until at least Tuesday against the Padres.
Hernandez felt some soreness in his lower back in the third inning against the White Sox and then was replaced after giving up a pair of home runs in the fifth inning. He was scheduled to start Wednesday night against the Angels, but Hector Noesi is starting that game on three days’ rest instead.
With Thursday’s off day, the Mariners can continue skipping Hernandez for the time being without causing any problems with their rotation. Kevin Millwood will start Friday on his normal fifth day, having last thrown Sunday in Chicago.
Jason Vargas, who won his seventh game of the season Monday in Anaheim, will also stay in his normal five-day routine by starting Saturday.
Sunday’s starting is being listed as TBA for now. If Hernandez is fully recovered, he’ll start the 1:10 p.m. series finale. If not, Blake Beavan would slide into that spot on his fifth day, having last pitched Tuesday against the Angels.
Here’s tonight’s lineup in the series finale against the Angels, who are going with right-hander Jerome Williams:
Ichiro Suzuki RF
Dustin Ackley 2B
Kyle Seager 3B
Jesus Montero DH
Justin Smoak 1B
Michael Saunders CF
Miguel Olivo C
Mike Carp LF

So I wrote this benchmark analyzer to analyze benchmarks that have many parameters and try to figure out what the important ones are. To that end, it creates a decision tree in R, and also generates lots of boxplots to visualize the different parameters. Here's a sample report (with boring data). It also (somewhat cleverly) saves the original .csv file with the web page it generates, so you can save the page and send it to a colleague who can play with the options and rerun the analysis.
It occurred to me as I was prettying this up that most benchmarks don't involve lots of parameters, and so the probability that anyone else is going to find this useful is pretty low. I'm OK with that because
- it's useful to me right this very moment for work stuff
- I had fun writing it and learned some more about R
- pretty graphs!
- it was good to work on something other than whereslunch.org for a while!

Rehearsals are going pretty well, albeit a bit tiring. We're about to get into "oh crap the shows is really really soon and we all suck" mode (it's an annual occurrence), but once we buckle down I think all will be well.
After rehearsal last night, I arrived home to find a few "dude, did you steal all the stuff in the guild bank?" IMs. Not a good sign. Tried to log in to WoW and couldn't, so I reset the password online and discovered that I had, indeed, done so. The weird thing is that the thief took basically all 5000 of my gold, but didn't sell any of my soulbound gear, and cleared out most of my bank but not all of it. And didn't find the 8 Primal Mights and 450 gold on my auction house mule.
Anyway, I filed a petition to get my crap back, which I think they usually do, and presumably they'll restore the guild bank as well. Yet another way WoW is better than the real world :-)

From one perspective, being notified of a problem as you get to work and later fixing that problem means you haven't made any progress - from your point of view things worked as well as they did before you came to work.
From another perspective, there was a horrendous bug that you didn't know about and now that it's gone peace can reign over the codebase. I find it very satisfying!?

My right eye has been doing this weird twitching for the past 5 days or so. It doesn't happen all the time, and it doesn't hurt, but sometimes it'll just start twitching like the eyelid is stuck open or caught on something. And the eye does feel a little dry. Anyone have any clue whether this is serious or not? It's a little irritating, but I can live with it if it's not the sign of some larger problem (eye falling out, for example - that would be bad).

Big work meeting today after lunch.
We met with our mortgage guy yesterday and everything seems to be in order, so bully for that. After work we're gonna view the house again and then, in all likelihood, make an offer, which is exciting! This just in: the house was not used previously to manufacture methamphetamines (yes, this question is on the seller's disclosure).
Also, $32 per month is a ridiculous sum of money to pay to a homeowner's association, for use of a pool that we'll probably never use.

Wow...so, crazy weekend.
Friday night was gala night, which was very well attended. The show went pretty well, then I went out and hung out with my family - it was nice to see them again, although I'm going to see them next week on vacation as well :-) Then I was cashier for silent auction people, and then my family and djedi and I headed over to Kerbey Lane Cafe which was good (although the service was quite slow). After that, bed, then we met my family for brunch the next morning at Whole Foods and went back to the theater for two more shows. By this point I was really getting tired - my part is pretty high-energy (stumbling all over stage and whatnot), so it takes a lot out of me. Anyway, after that we went to church and came home and had wildrice13 over for dinner.
Unfortunately, I had some work stuff I was pretty worried about so I went in to work to try to fix stuff while djedi and wildrice13 played some FFX-2. I ended up spending longer than I meant to at work (3.5 hours) but I eventually got in a groove (involving listening to my current music over and over again) and fixed both of my major issues, which I was quite pumped about! Came home, and FFX-2 was passed (including the special 100% cutscene) not too long afterwards. Congrats!
Sunday I slept in a little bit, which was really nice, then back to theater for two more shows, striking the set, and the cast party. We didn't stay too long because we were tired, then we headed up to destroyerj's for a monitor-viewing and games, including a rousing game of Simpsons Clue (Smithers did it!), Snipe Hunt, and a few rounds of Bop It!
So, today is my day between shows, and Charlotte's Web rehearsal starts tomorrow. I need to work more on memorizing my lines. Busy week between gamenight, two rehearsals, and djedi's birthday (happy birthday!). I think I'm done with djedi's code for now - it seems to work and the major source of confusion we had was cleared up...
So I wear a nightguard now when I sleep so I won't grind my teeth (which I apparently do like nobody's business...). The last time I had a nightguard it was for orthodontics work I had, and it hurt every morning when I woke up (presumably because my teeth were trying to shift back or whatever), so I was pleasantly surprised to find that this one doesn't hurt much at all, and it only makes it a little harder to get to sleep (which hasn't been much of an issue so far given how exhausted I've been!). Yay!.

GORHAM, ME (Jan. 28) — With 12 seconds remaining in the game and the Western Connecticut State University men's basketball team holding a one-point lead over the University of Southern Maine, senior Gary Robinson (Torrington, CT) missed the front end of a one-and-one that was rebounded by Southern Maine. Nine seconds later when USM's Chris Pagentine was fouled, he sank both foul shots, giving the Huskies a thrilling 85-84 win over the Colonials.
Senior guard Chris Pagentine (Lexington, N.C./North Davidson) calmly sank two free throws with 2.8 second remaining in regulation to lift the University of Southern Maine Huskies to an 85-84 win over the Western Connecticut State University Colonials Saturday afternoon at Hill Gymnasium in Gorham, Maine.
With the win Southern Maine rebounds from a two-game skid to improve to 8-10 overall and 2-7 in the Little East Conference. The loss is the first in three games for the Colonials who dip to 15-4 overall and 6-3 in the LEC. The Huskies’ win over the Colonials avenges an 88-58 loss earlier this season.
Pagentine was able to sink the game-winning free throws for the Huskies following an outstanding defensive effort from senior forward Jeremy Jackson (Laplace, La./Independence). After blocking a shot on the Colonials previous possession, Jackson was able to coral a huge defensive rebound off of a missed free throw that would have given the Colonials a two-point lead with seconds remaining. However, Jackson’s career-high 15th rebound of the game gave the Huskies another possession trailing 84-83 with 12 seconds to play. Fouled on the perimeter while attempting to drive to the basket, Pagentine sank both ends of a 1-and-1 for the win. The Colonials were unable to get a shot off in the final seconds of the game.
Jackson finished the game with a monster double-double on 25 points and 15 rebounds. He added three assists, one block and one steal. Pagentine, who was 7-for-12 from the field, had 18 points and two assists. Sophomore guard Brandon Tomah (Princeton, Maine/Calais) and junior guard Alex Kee (Bath, Maine/Morse) chipped in with 15 and 12 points each. Kee had four assists, while Tomah had three assists and three steals.
Senior guard DaQuan Brooks (Atlanta, Ga./Bristol Central (Conn.)) led the Colonials with 24 points and nine assists. Senior forward Gary Robinson (Torrington, Conn./Hotchkiss) added 14 points and six rebounds, while junior Michael Jensen (Gales Ferry, Conn./Ledyard) and sophomore center James Barnes (Middletown, Conn./Xavier) had 12 and 11 points each. Barnes led the Colonials in rebounding with seven boards.
The Huskies trailed Western Connecticut by as many as 11 points in the second half. Following a three-pointer from junior guard Ryan Pelletier (Wolcott, Conn.), the Colonials held a 72-61 advantage over the Huskies with 8:42 to play. The Huskies responded however scoring 13 straight points to lead 74-72 with 5:12 remaining. Four different players scored for the Huskies in the run, led by four points each from Jackson and sophomore forward John Roberts (Falmouth, Maine).
Brooks scored five straight points for the Colonials to regain a 77-74 lead with 4:02 to play and both teams battled over the next one minute and 19 seconds before Tomah canned a game-tying three with 2:43 on the clock for an 81-81 deadlock. The Colonials Jensen responded to Tomah’s three with one of his own for a 84-81 Western Connecticut lead before Pagentine hit a jumper to pull USM to within one 84-83 with 1:19 on the clock. Jackson came up with the block on the next Colonial possession and then secured the big defensive rebound setting up Pagentine for the game-winning heroics.
Southern Maine on Tuesday (7:30 p.m.) when it hosts Colby College. Western Connecticut hosts Connecticut College on Tuesday (7:30 p.m.). Both games are non-conference.

Dear Umbra,
At a gym I go to, lots of guys pick up bars of soap, use them for two minutes, and then leave them (even though there is a liquid soap dispenser in the showers). Is there any good use for several pounds of partially used soap per day?
Dennis
Seattle, Wash.
Dearest Dennis,
I have some harebrained schemes for you, but there are some natural limitations on the success of used-soap projects. First, there is the cost/benefit limitation: As I’m sure you know, the environment would be better served if you spent your valuable time convincing the gym owners to install low-flow showerheads or compact fluorescent light bulbs or other tried-and-true conservation measures. Second, there is the Ick limitation: I’m afraid that soap pre-owned by strange sweaty men is not the most appetizing commodity.
If you still want to pursue this project, don’t despair: Any true soap can be re-milled — that is, heated to melting, then poured into new molds. While the soap is liquid, you can add scented oils, oatmeal, tiny rubber duckies, or whatever strikes your fancy. I think you know what I’m getting at: holiday gifts! Nothing says “I Love You” better than somewhat homemade soap.
If gifts don’t grab you, how about donations? Organizations with bathing facilities and tight budgets might appreciate a soap-redistribution system; I’m thinking of shelters, mostly, though you could ask at schools. But here again, the sweaty-man issue rears its unsavory head: Used bar soap can be a veritable bacteria-mobile, and might be rejected on that basis.
Alternatively, you could campaign for your gym to cease offering solid soap — an environmental initiative that could be cloaked as a cost-saving measure or even as an anti-germ campaign. But be careful not to let anyone propose antibacterial liquid soap as the solution; we don’t want your gym to contribute to the creation of antibiotic resistance and Super Bacteria.
Fitfully,
Umbra

Awareness of global warming among Americans is shooting up faster than the mercury in a drought-ravaged cornfield.
According to two major surveys published this week, most people in the U.S. now know that climate change is the reason the weather is being so weird. Acceptance of climate science has almost climbed back to its 2008 levels, following a depressing propaganda-powered dip that hit a low point in 2010.
University of Michigan researchers asked about 1,000 people [PDF] this past fall whether there is solid evidence that the world has been warming during the past four decades, and 67 percent said “yes.” That’s down from the 72 percent that responded affirmatively in the fall of 2008, but up from just 52 percent in the spring of 2010. Of those who agree that the world is warming, just 19 percent attribute the change to natural patterns. The rest say humanity shoulders some or all of the blame.
Even 51 percent of Republicans agree that global warming is happening, according to the U of M poll, up from 33 percent in 2010.
Meanwhile, Global Warming’s Six Americas, an ongoing joint project of Yale University and George Mason University, reported a similar trend from its own survey of 1,000 people. The project puts Americans into one of six categories based on their climate-change views: alarmed, concerned, cautious, disengaged, doubtful, or dismissive. From that report’s findings:.
Enough words. Here’s a nice graph from the Six Americas report that shows where Americans stand on the issue, with bigger bubbles representing more people:

One of the primary concerns about expanded oil drilling in the Arctic is that the Arctic is far away from everything. Until very, very recently, no one lived anywhere near the Arctic; even today, it’s pretty sparsely populated. As we’ve noted before, an oil spill a few hundred miles from New Orleans in 2010 took months to stop. How long will it take to cap a broken well in icy water thousands of miles from any resources?
To that end, governments interested in exploring resource extraction in the Arctic came together to develop a plan for just such a contingency. And as Greenpeace notes, the plan sucks. From the BBC:
In 2011 The Arctic Council members [Ed. - Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, U.S.] signed the Nuuk Declaration that committed them to develop an international agreement on how to respond to oil pollution in the northern seas. …
The plan says that “each party shall maintain a national system for responding promptly and effectively to oil pollution incidents” without requiring any clear details on the number of ships or personnel that would be needed to cope with a spillage.
Seriously. Greenpeace has a copy of the full draft document [PDF]. It can be summed up in three bullet points:
- Here are the countries making this agreement and here is what “oil” means.
- If anything happens, we agree to deal with it.
- Here is everyone’s emergency contact information.
Think I’m oversimplifying? Go look. This took them two years.
Sweden’s ambassador to the Council thinks the agreement is great, saying, “The agreement is a great step forward for the protection of the Arctic from an oil spill because it sets up a system for the states to co-operate in practice.” Because if this weren’t in place — what? If Shell fucked up and caused a spill, Russia and Canada would just tell the U.S. “tough shit”? No, if there were a spill that threatened the shoreline of any country, it would get involved with or without this document. And I suspect everyone already has the right phone numbers.
There will be a spill in the Arctic. That’s not me saying it. That’s Shell Alaska Vice President Pete Slaiby saying it. When that happens, it would be nice to know that there’s some sort of well-funded, well-staffed, resource-heavy international entity standing by to spring into action. That there’s something there in the empty Arctic that can be on-scene in short order to deal with the problem.
But, you know. Lip service is good too.

You were born to work for God!
You know you have a destiny. You know that God has a calling on your life and you want to fulfill the incredible plans he has laid out for you. Seeing souls saved, needs met, and the gospel preached gets you pumped. You were born to work for God!
Or, maybe you are the type of person who cannot say with confidence that God has big things in store, but you have a heart for God that is huge. Something in you breaks when you think about people who do not know Christ. Your heart is torn when you picture the state of the world. But you’re not one of those people who merely point out the need, you want to be there when God answers the need! When God answers prayers and does miracles, you want to be there, not only to watch, but to participate.
If your prayer is that God’s kingdom would be built and his Son glorified, this book is for you. By the time you have turned the last page, and read the last words, you will be better equipped to participate in God’s plan.
However, it would be a shame to skip the first step in this whole process. We must get first things first, or nothing will come out right.
You are called to make Him known, to be effective and to produce lasting fruit, so your first priority must be to know God well. The next several articles are about getting to know God – His voice, His strategies. If you learn who He is, how to hear Him, and what He is most concerned about, you will be effective in making Him known.
Be sure and read the following articles. As these are more lengthy articles, take the time to process through each before moving on to the next.
What do you see?

Season extension enables a plant or crop to be grown and cultivated beyond the normal outdoor growing season and can take a variety of forms:
Raised Beds
Raised beds are constructed to hold soil and plants above the ground. The loosened soil, which can be piled a few inches to more than one foot above the surrounding ground, heats up more quickly in spring, enabling earlier planting of crops. Learn more.
Mulches
Mulches refer to material placed on top of the soil surrounding plants to help them retain heat. Mulches can include straw, compost and synthetic materials such as plastic sheeting with slits cut to allow for plants to grow through. Learn how to use mulches in your garden. Learn more.
Row Covers and Low Tunnels
Row covers refer to light fabric or cover, such as newspaper cones or plastic, placed over plants for frost protection and heat retention. Low tunnels are floating row covers constructed like high-tunnels, but are much smaller in size. Low tunnels cover plants to provide wind and frost protection and they are removed once outdoor temperatures reach the necessary levels for growing. Learn how to use floating row covers. Learn more.
Cold Frames
Cold frames and hot beds are enclosures built low to the ground with transparent roofs. They are used by gardeners to protect plants from cold weather. Typically hot beds, which have a heat source, are used for starting plants and cold frames, which do not have a heat source, are used to harden plants to outdoor conditions before transplanting.

Matt Damon's Uncle Swims In Uncharted WatersPosted September 27, 2007, 12:35 pm in Water Sports
Credit Growing Bolder
Nobody likes a good swim better than George Brunstad. But not many decide to set a world record for their 70th birthday.
Just three days after blowing out the candles, he slipped into the waters off Dover and didn't get out until he had crossed the English Channel off the French coast at Sangette. He was in the water for 15 hours and 59 minutes, making him officially the oldest person ever to swim the English Channel.
It was no fluke thing for Brunstad. He told Growing Bolder that he's won more than 100 medals in Masters Swimming events.
He also talked to us about what it's like being Matt Damon's uncle. He said although Matt leads a fascinating life, Uncle George is more than happy with his more quiet and sedate lifestyle.
But all that began to change back in 2004 when Brunstad's swim made him a celebrity in his own right. He said the Channel swim did present some challenges. How did he do it? The Connecticut resident trained in Long Island Sound and the chilly waters of Maine.
In the Channel, he slathered himself in lanolin and petroleum jelly. Then he swam with escort swimmers pulling alongside for a few minutes every six hours to steer him in the right direction. In total, taking into account the tides, he probably swam 32 miles.
But he didn't do it just for himself. He raised $11,000 for a Haitian orphanage. How did he feel the next day? "Stiff and sore." And just a little wrinkled!
Brunstad, who retired in 1994 as a pilot for American Airlines, beat the previous record holder, Australian Clifford Batts, who crossed the Channel in 1987 at the age of 67 and 240 days.

Cutie. Thanks Jo Anne E. Cacnio. I super like it!
Is been 20 years and we still have that bond like no other. We’ve shared a lot of fun-filled memories when we were growing up. We used to sneak out to spend time together. Haha! Our parents were very strict, not for everyone though, but mine was.
Peace Mom! I know you were doing what was best for us. /hug. I spent most of my childhood years with them. We learned many things together and from each other; shared experiences; fell in love – for some (you know who you are). Haha! Now, I wonder, never in this circle of friends made it to forever. I guess, that’s just the way it is.
After many years, we’ve bonded again last night, felt like old times. Thanks Jo for the invitation and to your mom too who has always been the mom for all. Happy Fiesta!!! Looking forward of our next get together.
By the way, this is how we were few years back. Let’s not mention the year anymore. Lol.

A Bar at Avenue Suites twinkled last night with "Bravo-lebrities" for leggy NYC Housewife Kelly Bensimon's book party for her new book, I Can Make You Hot: The Supermodel Diet. Tickets purchased through Gilt City granted ladies a signed copy of the diet lifestyle book and two specialty cocktails curated by A Bar's Brennan Adams. Ladies that opted for a third cocktail sprang for the "Midnight in Paris," a spicy champagne drink with a splash of Saint Germain.
DC Housewives Lynda Erkiletian and Mary Amons attended. When Lynda's glasses were off, she accidentally mixed Mary and Kelly up--the tall dark-blonde stars were both channeling boho maxi looks at the party.

Dangers of ‘dynastical democracy’
Perhaps people reach for known brands such as Trudeau or Le Pen when crises make them frightened by uncertainties
- Image Credit: AP
- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
Kennedy. Roosevelt. Bush. Clinton. Gandhi. Bhutto. Gore. Aquino. Miliband. Le Pen. What do these familiar names have in common? They are all, in one way or another, names of political dynasties — families from whom more than one member has come to prominence in political life. Justin Trudeau, son of former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, became the most recent addition to the list as he announced his intention to run for Liberal party leader this week.
The Clintons and the Milibands skew the trend — marital and fraternal bonds rather than a multi-generational lineage. But Trudeau’s recent rise to prominence in Canada reminds us that dynasty — the “trusted brand” of the alpha family name — still plays a significant role in many democracies. What does this tell us about how modern democracies are operating? For surely “dynastical democracy” is in some sense a contradiction in terms?
Take France and the US: Countries founded, in part, on a conception of civic nationalism in which “all men are created equal”, not the hereditary power of monarchies. When Hillary Clinton announced her bid for presidency in 2007, it was noted that, at that point, “40 per cent of Americans have never lived without a Bush or Clinton in the White House” — although America’s hereditary low-point of the new century was surely in 2000, when Al Gore, son of Senator Albert Gore, ran against George Bush, son of, well, George Bush. Even Barack Obama’s election — a democratic endorsement of a figure who did not emerge from a dynastical elite — was met with inevitable references to Kennedy’s “Camelot” and the iconography of golden-age patrician politics, while a Vogue interview with Chelsea Clinton this summer gushed that she was “waiting in the wings” before a (natural? entitled?) turn to politics. When the last French presidential elections were in the party-primary stages in 2011, the Socialist party’s Martine Aubry, daughter of Jacques Delors, was a possible presidential candidate alongside Marine Le Pen, inheritor of her father’s xenophobic Front National.
Dynasties once governed Europe, of course, in the monarchies that cling on in constitutional arrangements or, in the case of coalition Britain, are utilised through their weddings and jubilees to reinforce the regressive notion that all’s well and everyone “in their right place”. Elites are self-perpetuating; the different spheres of power interplaying with one another, meaning the economic elite can more easily dabble in politics — think of the Mitford sisters trying ideologies on like dresses. Dynasties that emerge in republics are perhaps more compelling: From Bonaparte to Gandhi, a name can become so bound up with the nation’s birth that it comes to embody it in the eyes of many. There is also an obvious gendered dimension: Many modern female leaders have been daughters of presidents and prime ministers, as though the importance of bloodline negated the usual disadvantage of female-ness, little help as that is to most women. Dynasties in modern dictatorships are common enough — hard to think of an autocrat without thinking of his playboy son, PhD-plagiarising or Ferrari-crashing, who gets appointed something like minister of finance, no doubt on the basis of his qualifications. State corruption in the form of clientelism and kleptocracy manifests when the nation’s wealth becomes diverted to the ruling family and those whom nepotism grants access to this walled world.
But what’s striking if you look at the current political landscape is the prevalence of dynasties in self-proclaimed liberal democracies, where the descendants of statesmen are voted into power. In countries like the US, it may be facets of democracy itself that cultivate dynasties — the mushrooming cost of electoral campaigning leaves politics to those who have already accumulated wealth as well as connections. It can be bound with the historical dominance of a party and a family’s role within that party, such as the Congress party in India. Perhaps, as with the truism that extreme ideologies become more electorally palatable during economic crises, voters do indeed reach for “trusted brand names” when crises make them frightened by the world’s uncertainties.
The negative effects of “democratic dynasties” are obvious: A fossilisation of the elite decays democracy as well as social and economic mobility, fostering “rent-seeking” behaviour in deference to the powerful families. But political discourse can deteriorate as names become more important than issues. You don’t need to say the name “George Bush” to know that a dynastical tendency might mean you don’t get the most competent candidate, and — while having a political family heritage doesn’t mean you can’t be a competent politician — those who haven’t struggled to make a name for themselves are likely to be made of different stuff to the pioneer who carved out their own place in the world.
Perhaps it is worthwhile asking ourselves: As voters, why do so many of us keep going for the “trusted brand” of dynasties? And if we are living in an era of the “democratic dynasty”, how did we come to choose our own aristocrats?

ZAGREB: Away fans will be banned from both World Cup qualifying matches between Croatia and Serbia, the two football federations announced on Thursday.The former enemies took the joint decision in a bid to avoid crowd trouble at the games in Zagreb and Belgrade. “It was decided that there will be no organized travel of visiting squads’ fans for the next two Group A qualifying matches between Croatia and Serbia,” the federations said in a joint statement.“The decision is based on the fact that both matches are high risk and it was concluded that this is the best preventive measure.” They added that the move was made in line with recommendations by FIFA, UEFA and the relevant local authorities.The first match is to be played on March 22 in Zagreb, and the second on September 6 in Belgrade.Relations between the two countries gradually improved since Croatia’s 1990s war against Belgrade-backed rebel Serbs who opposed its independence from the former Yugoslavia.However, sports events including teams from the two countries are still considered high risk.The qualifiers are the first football matches between the two nations since the 1991-1995 conflict.In 1999, Croatia played their 2000 European championship qualifiers against Yugoslavia — at the time composed of Montenegro and Serbia — without visiting fans.

Black screen with blinking cursor[ Edited ]
08-01-2012 05:45 PM - edited 08-01-2012 05:53 PM
Yesterday I experienced a blue screen occurrence, which I did not take seriously. I let it run its course and simply restarted. Following the blue screen I used my computer as I normally would. I ran a thorough virus scan last night to assure that my computer was clean and nothing came up. Today, while I was browsing the web, my computer shut all of my applications and restarted. After the restart I have been unable to get beyond the black screen with the blinking cursor.
I am using an HP Pavilion Elite e9220y PC. I am using Windows 7 64-bit. Besides the blue screen, I have had no forewarning of this occurrence. Recently I have downloaded the game series "Dawn of War" through steam. Today I updated "Minecraft." Beyond those two recent additions to my computer, I cannot recall installing anything.
Thus far I have used another computer running Windows 7 64-bit to create a system repair disk to access the system recovery tools. I have run the Startup Repair option multiple times and come up with nothing. However, it did recommend I unplug devices and try to restart windows. I did this to no avail. Currently I only have my mouse, keyboard and monitor plugged in. I have also tried a System Restore to earlier today where a Windows Update: Type "Critical Update" was said to have been installed.
I have been able to use the "Recovery Manager" to Backup files onto an external hard drive that I connected through a USB port, So I do not believe that anything is wrong with the hard drive itself. Please help me with this problem.
Sorry for the long post.
Solved! Go to Solution.

Since you have backed up your files you could go for the Recovery Manager option to reinstall back to Factory specs.

Why I’m Not Reading George Eliot, Same Goes for COBOL
Critical transformation decisions can't ignore application functionality.
But how do you "read" all your code beforehand?

Ropes, Strings, and Threads
In my recent posts, Meet the Clones in My Neighborhood and You're Only as JUNG as You Feel, I mentioned how JUNG could be used to extract clusters of cloned code from a complex graph of an entire application. This has been very helpful to drill down into code to look at sub clusters as in the tiled image below. (I’ve substituted number for module names, since this is actual code.) But even with this simplified image, the team wanted to convey more meaning in our next generation tool: Visual Intelligence Explorer. The amazing thing about JUNG is that it allows our team to have complete control over the image rendering process. So we can control how the lines are drawn between the nodes. Up till now, with other tools, we’ve been coloring the lines, green for a weak relationship, red for a strong one. But using JUNG we’ve discovered lines convey meaning more intuitively when weighted instead of being colored.
This is especially useful in large graphs, where lines can hide other lines and get lost in the tangle. Line weights are natural and intuitive. Think of cable, rope, twine, string, and thread. Just the sound of those linear objects conveys strength. Cables pull barges, ropes rope cows, twine bales hay, string wraps packages, and threads? Well a thread is what I’m hanging by with this metaphor.
But just look at the image below, over 200,000 lines of code are represented by this graph of code modules, what’s important, what’s not? Let’s add some weights to those lines.
Here’s a zoom-in of the same image. Here we’ve made four types of lines; the weakest are dotted lines, the threads. Then we move all the way to our ropes and cables. The point is now we can see the most important cloned code.
Our Visual Intelligence Explorer is taking shape very quickly. Please check back here, soon I’ll be posting about using the text search engine Lucene to find legacy source code signatures.

@Dex Why would you be spending money on a fuckbuddy? I think you need to learn the difference between one of those and a girlfriend.
Anyway, wasn’t this posted ages ago?
lol Dex, what a post.
I guess this is cool in some ways, but part of me is screaming, “Just go outside, damnit!”
Master’s thesis on that? Really ?
I think Tacx has him beat at present
The Tacx is a little more expensive…..
Considering google street view is a series of images, why would you expect it to be anything other than a slideshow? Were you expecting a video to construct itself out of images?
Why would you expect that it would be a smooth experience? Anyone who has used street view knows that you can’t smoothly scroll through it, you need to continue to click to advance to each next segment along the route.
@Marco I was wondering the same, but after all, it’s not engineering or computer science, it’s “a 12-month intensive course that is designed specifically for art and design graduates”
@Marco
Agreed. This is trivial. Its sad that some people spend money on a degree like this thinking it will land them a real job. This would be a cool project if an 10 year old had done it, but coming from a masters student this is just sad. Good luck finding a job in this economy
“Whets” your appetite, not “wets.” Common mistake.
For a master thesis, for any course, this really is sad. You can determine the direction with a single latching hall sensor, if you place the magnets such that both the north and south poles pass over the hall sensor, and the distance between the magnets is much larger then the width of the magnet. Pedaling in one direction would give a small duty-cycle (short high pulse), and the other direction would give a large duty cycle (short low pulse). I’d like to thing any masters student would be able to figure that out.
The concept of point-of-view rides could be viable, with a number of improvements. First of all, a larger number of magnets would be a good idea, to get a shorter measurement interval.
It would be really cool to incorporate steepness or pedal torque data in the stream, and use an eddy current or other electronically controllable brake on the bike, to mirror the pedaling torque required for a given speed to the actual ride.
A panoramic view (from a panoramic helmet camera) would be really cool, because that would enable the use of a VR helmet.
You can really make it as simple or complicated as you like. There could even be a commercial market for the ride data…
A masters thesis? Seriously? Wow. What a piece of crap. A masters thesis on… Generating forward/back/left/right keystrokes from and exercise machine???
Really?
Seriously???
Wow. I’d be embarassed to be that guy. What a fail. People with REAL masters thesis’ are going to laugh this guy out of the indistry!!!
Also, HAD, you should be embarassed for posting this worthless writeup. FAIL. Go sit in the corner for a MILLION YEARS.
it says “PART OF” a master’s thesis, FYI — lots of theses in design and the applied arts involve a portfolio of projects, and this could be just one of them. No one is going to get a master’s degree just for making this one thing.
I like HaD, but frankly the cranky bitter frustrated-engineer mindset that shows up in the comments (not on the site content, imagine that) is just gross. If we left everything up to the designers and artists we’d have gorgeous products that felt great to use but didn’t work mechanically; if we left it all up to the engineers every single product would work fine but it would be a 600 pound stainless steel cube.
People here need to learn to accept that they can do some things better than other people, and other people are much better than them at other things, rather than the whole “omg you mean he didn’t wind his own resistors from carbon wire what a fucking n00b HaD sux” bullshit attitude.
Out(in) for a leisurely ride and Dammit,I looked, the light was green and WHAM one frame later and I get hit by a bus. To make things worse it had an add for Microsoft Windows mobile 7 on the side.
@Marco
My thoughts, exactly.
It’s awesome — breaks the monotony of stationary exercise equipment nicely, except it looks like his screen is too small and not ergonomic enough to get really… immersed. i think it’s a great project and creative and resourceful.
i finally wrote a book:
To those of you who appreciate the project, Thank you very much, for those of you who dont, thats up to yourselves, whatever, considering I come from an art background and never touched so much as an LED prior to this year, I feel I did all right out of it, as for a job in the ‘indistry’ at least I can spell the word!
Also this was only a tiny PART of the Masters Thesis not the complete assessed work for the year,
I guess it is easy being so critical when hiding behind your computer screens,
Thank you to those of you who at least tried to be nice about it.
First off I saw this more than a year (maybe two) ago already, so this guy steals stuff for a thesis?
And @jake you scream he should be embarrassed then type the word “indistry”…
This still isn’t going to get me on an exercise bike, though I would happily jump on one if I could play some San Andreas from the seat.
At least use a head-mounted display to give you more immersion.
@M4C
Simulator sickness would be a huge problem. HMDs require significant further development before you can really just drop them in like that.
@Lette
The electrical side of this is really not that complicated no matter how you set it up, and you chose an approach that would seem sensible to someone with much more experience in the topic area. I wouldn’t worry about that too much. The design and human sides of this are much more complex and interesting anyway.
This would be really cool if you recorded favorite routes, and then just used faster / slower key inputs into VLC based on the interval between passes. It would be fairly simple to code as well.
On a side note, people around you would look quite funny.
@Whatnot
I’m doing pretty damn good for typing all this crap from a blackberry, dammit!
Also, I agree with Whatnot, saw this somewhere else a long time ago!
hello,
made same thing one year ago using an usb keyboard controller to allow not electronic people to build one.
used to allow my father to distract when do some cyclette exercises (he has some problem walking…)
allow also to choose location with super easy interface, with best city around, and an option to randomize location based on db.
is usefull for people with some disabilities, and funny for all others…
@ Jake and others, yup This idea was out before, I never said I was the first to come up with the idea, far from it, but this was built for people with disabilites and have no experience with computers and also to prove that something like this can be built at little or no cost, all build and code is original though, I didnt steal anything thanks!!
Why did you have to “prove” something that was already common sense?
Only required input: Left, right, forward, back. Lol.
I’m sorry, sounds like it’s better suited for a highschool science project. I’m shocked that anyone would consider this a relevant thesis topic, it must have taken all of what, 2 days to finish? If that??? A thesis is supposed to mean something, be relevent and complex…
*sigh*
You know, I just realized something. You *aren’t* an electrical person, are you. See, I’m going on the assumption that your “Interactive Media” description implied that you were some sort of electrical engineering technology student or something. If you don’t have an electrical background, then bravo for figuring out the use of hall sensors and whatnot, but still – If I did my masters in EE with a thesis that tried to do someting that had already been done 10 times over, they’d tell me to go to hell and laugh me out of the office. Maybe things are different in your program. I dunno.
Jake, but who said its EE? :) u clearly havent read any of my post or blog to find out anything about the project, its all there if you read it!! Im not an engineer I am a creative with a background in art and absolutely no background at all in electronics of any kind, if you had read the full post you wouldnt have had to ‘realise’ that!
There is a massive difference and the Masters was not just based on this build alone because yes, its very basic electronics, but graded rather on the quality of content in research and explanation and in showing documentary evidence of everything involved in this project, not just the build but working with people with disabilities and palliative illness themselves.
The project was built for them and was PROVEN for them because the majority if not all the people I worked with during this project in the care centre had never heard of a hall sensor much less an arduino!!
Try not to be so critical when there is far more to the picture than what you read in a brief blog post, where my engineering fails it makes up for in the HCI, user studies and Human factors involved, thats the side of interaction design I studied!
I use the Taxc almost every day in the winter for a Cycling Trainer .. You can import Google Earth kml..with elevation controlling a torque inducing motor to mimic very realistically hills both up and down .. Ride it .. Save it .. Upload to a Tacx supported web site and “race” against ppl from all over the world . And there is a Live REal Time way to ride with other riders . . the cost is around $1200 pricey for most, but for a serious Cycler it’s not much…

Work/Life Balance in Library School
05/12/2011 § 14 Comments our schoolwork, we must obtain as much library experience as possible prior to graduation so that we can maximize our job prospects. Even those of us who are fortunate enough to land paying part-time library work find it necessary to broaden our CVs through volunteer positions or unpaid internships – often more than one! In order sell ourselves to potential employers, we participate in conferences, blog, tweet, network, maintain digital portfolios, and try to find time for a beer once in a while. Such overextension can quickly lead to exhaustion and burnout…but in this economic climate where jobs are scarce, we’re all anxious to set ourselves apart from the hundreds of other candidates out there. So, how can we be successful librarians and lead balanced lives?
This is a question I’ve been grappling with throughout my first semester. I came to library school after several years in the workforce, in a position that I adored but that also demanded my every waking moment. After three years of seventy hour work weeks and a personal life that was in complete limbo, I finally admitted that my lifestyle was not sustainable. When I started at library school in the fall, I wondered what changes I could make that would allow me to downshift. I still wanted to work hard, but I also wanted to enjoy my life.
So I decided to be systematic about how I spent my time in library school. I asked myself what achievements and skills potential employers would seek in me after graduation. I knew that varied work experiences and French language abilities would be high on the list, so I took a part-time job at a public library as soon as I could. I enrolled in a French class (I hope to find work in Montreal so bilingualism is important). I also signed up for two student committees, took volunteer opportunities when possible, and committed to presenting at one conference at least this year.
Although these activities have spread me pretty thin, probably too thin to downshift successfully, I feel I’ve made a good decision about how to allot my time. Happily, I also find that I am devoting a great deal more time to my relationship, family, and friends, leading to a much greater sense of well-being in my personal life. I do have more balance than I did before.
Even so, I still struggle. Letting go of my own perfectionism has been a major hurdle for me this semester. Sometimes I find myself thinking thoughts like, If I didn’t have so much to do, I would have a perfect GPA. Then I berate myself for not being good enough to do it all and have a perfect GPA. I continually have to remind myself that being well-rounded is not only important, but healthy.
The ACRLog has an interesting post on this subject. According to them, many libraries are experiencing difficulties attracting solid candidates in the Gen X and Gen Y age brackets to directorship positions, as the younger librarians prefer to devote more energy to their families and friends than to a stressful, demanding position that is not perceived as rewarding. While I am not sure that Gen X and Gen Y are really that easy to pigeonhole, for me the main point of the article was that the younger librarians are not pursuing advancement simply for the sake of advancement. They want their lives to be fulfilled in every context.
As librarians-in-training with many demands on our time, how can we avoid exhaustion and burnout? The website LIScareer has a list of articles that deal with these issues in a library setting. I can also share with you some time management techniques that have kept me sane this semester:
Limit Your Available Time
I had a professor who always said, “Work expands to fill all available time.” I didn’t understand what she meant back then, but now I realize how true this statement is. Since I don’t want my work to dominate my life, I try to limit my available time. For example, just because I have all Saturday to complete a homework assignment doesn’t mean I have to take all Saturday to do it. I ask myself, could I finish it in five hours? If the answer is yes, I work as efficiently as I can to get it done in that five hour block. Ironically, I’ve found that the work I produce in these limited chunks of time is usually better than it would be if I dragged it out for days.
Ask Yourself Where Your Time Really Goes
In the same way it’s easy to lose track of how much money you spend if you don’t record every purchase, it’s easy to lose track of how you actually spend your time. I might tell myself that I worked on my essay until 3AM, but if I was checking Facebook every few minutes then that’s not really true. I want to exercise but keep telling myself I don’t have the time, when I could easily scrap the TV I watch before bed to get up early for a swim. Being aware of where your time really goes can make a huge difference in your efficiency.
Give Your Work All You’ve Got – Then Leave
It used to be that the boundaries between work life and home life were a lot more distinct. You just left the office and that was it. These days, the onus is on you to set those boundaries. This requires some planning and communication, but a few simple changes can help a lot. Do schoolwork on campus or in a coffee shop, not at home. Tell your coworkers that you don’t check your work e-mail on weekends. Try to have an established routine even on days when you don’t have classes so that you don’t unintentionally end up wasting the whole day. Above all, work as hard as you can while you’re working – then get out of there and stop thinking about it!
How about you? What do you do to manage your time? Drop me a comment here or e-mail me at lauramariesanders at gmail dot com!
Good article Laura! I struggle with time management. I usually start out my semester with a calendar of all homework due dates, and sometimes weekly schedules with To-Do lists. But somehow these efforts become futile after the first two weeks.
My homework always seems to stretch to fill all my empty time…but you’re right I do waste time on “distractions” like Netflix or Facebook.
I have considered spending more time on campus to do my homework, instead of doing it at home. I think I will try that next semester. When I do work on campus, I feel in the school-mode and I do feel more productive, whereas when I do work at home, I’m more likely to wish I just go to bed or relax.
Thanks for sharing. Hopefully I can do better in the spring semester.
Netflix is the worst when it comes to distraction! I could spend hours on it just watching movies.
Great article- I know finding a balance can be very, very difficult. I find it quite hard to fit in everything I’d like because while I am in library school (online program through UW-Milwaukee) I am also working a full time job (database editing/managment, sort of library related). Internships are impossible because of work. So I rely more on volunteering and networking.
A big help for me is asking the professors for reading lists/syllabi early on, so I can start reading before the classes begin for the semester.
The best advice I can give is to not worry about your lib school grades. Seriously. No one will care if you didn’t get a 4.0. Your time is better spent getting work experience, or picking up a new language, or building tech skills…pretty much anything else.
Rebecca, I have heard that from so many recent graduates who now have good jobs. And I have tried to make that my attitude this semester…but it’s hard not to slip back into my old perfectionistic habits, particularly when everyone around me is freaking out about grades all the time!
And, as a corollary to that, don’t avoid useful classes just because you won’t get an A! I saw this happen depressingly often when I was in grad school.
You mean classes like Cataloguing?
It’s pretty much been the bane of my existence this semester…but I have to admit, it’s a highly useful class, so much so that I think it should be mandatory for all library school students.
I’m totally guilty of dragging my work out for days. I need to sit down and just get my projects done. I look forward to the day when I don’t have to work and go to school full-time.
Annie, me too! There are many days that I don’t have the mental energy to do homework at the end of a workday. I am only going to school part-time and working full-time, and I’m looking forward to only having to work. One more year to go….
Thanks for a great article! I’m just wrapping up my first semester. I also feel like I’ve been spreading myself fairly thin though I’m really happy and feel like I’ve achieved some kind of balance. Your tip about limiting available time is really helpful, though. I’ll give myself a day to finish an assignment (usually well in advance) but then I think, “Oh, I have the whole day to work on this” and then it gets dragged out. Limiting it to smaller chunks of time will help a lot – definitely will try it next semester!

The bone on the seder plate represents the Passover lamb. Many residents in food deserts are forced to consume unhealthy fast food, but with more supermarkets, residents can regain the opportunity to purchase healthy food.
Can low-income communities support supermarkets?
Yes! Many low-income communities are densely populated, and incomes add up. In South LA, the annual income per acre is $350,000, roughly four times that of the LA/Long Beach metro average. South LA residents spend hundreds of millions of dollars per year on groceries.

A wise and noble people...
Were nowhere to be seen...
More than 200 native and nonnative people shouted down a sheriff who was delivering a court order that called for the immediate removal of a blockade at a proposed uranium mine north of Sharbot Lake.Once again, it's the inarticulate, nonsensicle voice of the cult of personal victimization. You'd get more coherent communication from a boxcar load of starving, tormented chimps.
Yesterday, two sheriffs, escorted by Ontario Provincial Police, were met on the road outside the mine by Ardoch and Shabot Obaadjiwan First Nations warriors who would not allow the court officers on the property.
Shabot Obaadjiwan war chief Earl Badour, who oversees the security of the protesters at the site, said he met the officers with a group of about 24 warriors.And then he held his breath until he turned blue.
"I said to them we were not speaking," said Badour.
Badour then signalled for the native flag to be turned upside down as a symbolic gesture that "all natives are in distress."

Yeah? ..and this court order says i don't really give a rats ass if you speak or not..speaking is over, upholding the law is where we are now at..
What part of shut up and obey do they not understand?
Tell them you are going to come back with the riot quad next time..

that would involve political will... not a commodity in generous supply, in ontario these days.

Police in Ontario actually attempting to enforce the law, I don't believe it!
And the Indians shouldn't, either. Hold fast, Chief, the Great White Father in Toronto will cave pretty quickly, there's an election coming.
Hand out some "Dudley George" masks, that should have everyone on the run.
Oh, yeah, anything around to burn, tires, police cars, bridges?
Prison for all those idiots.
Unfortunately this is not just a native issue in this case.
Us righties are pissed too.
View from the local Con candidate.
Property values are already being affected and sales dipping in the market. This thing is screwing more then just these natives.
*
"ewalden said... his is not just a native issue in this case"
totally not the point, my friend.
how can you negotiate, or even discuss what's happening here, if the aboriginals hijack the issue and then act as if they're starring in a less-civilised remake of "lord of the flies."
maybe next time they'll decide your house is on sacred land. watch property values plummet then.
anarchy is most decidedly not the answer... not now... not ever.

Mining Uranium in anyone's neigborhood gets them worried about health and environment issues. Native or non native, increased cancer risk and contamination of out natural resources is no joke. I am thankful that the community both sides of that gate, are there to stand against the mine.

"anon said... Mining Uranium in anyone's neigborhood"
again...
how can you negotiate, or even discuss what's happening here if you replace the law of the land with hysterical lawlessness?

Apparently King George II gave them the land in 1763 in a proclamation that also recognized the nation-to-nation relationship that the Crown has with the indigenous peoples of North America and acknowledged the Aboriginal title of their homelands.
From what I hear these particular lands were never ceded. So the rule of law (and the Ipperwash commission) would suggest the discussion should be as one between nations, rather than cops and trespassers.
I would have thought even a righty would be against a Mining act, such as the one we have in Ontario, which allows the Government to sell the mineral rights to my (non-native) land to a corporation without even consulting me. The Algonquins just cut a better deal back in the day than we colonial subjects did.
*
"anon announces... From what I hear these particular lands were never ceded."
from what you hear?
there's an entirely new concept... "anecdotal law."
no real study, or law school required... "your honour, rumour has it..."
lemme know how that works out the next time you're in court.
*
It's not new, it's at least as old as "stand-up law": If you can't refute a point with facts then hit'em with a zinger.
The pivotal question in cases such as this one is what is required on the part of the Crown (as well as its agents, and ministries) to maintain the honour of the Crown and to achieve reconciliation between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples as is required under Section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982?
Aboriginal title and rights are still in existence in the Kiji Sìbì (Ottawa Valley), including what became Northern Frontenac County.
These lands were never ceded or surrendered to the Crown. As the Algonquin community holding title and rights within the lands in question, and as an Aboriginal community whose rights are embedded, recognized and guaranteed in the Section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982, clearly both the Province of Ontario and the federal government have Constitutional duties and obligations to protect aboriginal lands from the detrimental activities associated with uranium mining.
What’s more, Frontenac Ventures Corporation should not have been granted claims or staking rights on these traditional lands without prior notification by the Ministry of Mining and Northern Development, and they should not have been allowed to purchase crown lands without our consent, as the Algonquin people are the only autonomous authority within those lands.
*
it's good to know this is all so legally "cut and dried"... all the aboriginals have to do is stop acting like crazy children and go to court and get their own injunction.
oh wait... they don't recognise the "white mans law", do they?
*
neocon realized...'oh wait... they don't recognise (sic) the "white mans (sic) law", do they?'
By George!!! If I interpret your naive regurgitation of post-colonial jargon correctly, I believe you've got it. Or at least you are getting close.
At any rate they are also blockading on the settlers' behalf. Supporting good conservative ideals, as expressed by Randy Hillier, PC Candidate and longtime leader of the Lanark Landowners Association:
"First, Ontario should award all property owners the subsurface rights to their land...
"Second, revenues from mineral revenues on Crown lands should be shared with municipalities...(well, they may have their own interpretation of this one)
"Third, it should be the local people themselves who decide whether mineral exploitation goes ahead..."
source: "Ontario Mining Law is a Mess" By Randy Hillier and Scott Reid
*
anon protests... they are also blockading on the settlers' behalf"
ya just gotta love that aboriginal altruism.
and randy hillier, of course... it's exactly the same thing.
remind me again... which tract of land have randy and his band of conservative thugs illegally occupied this week?

Skeletons in legal closet
Activists charge Law Society made away with stolen Six Nations funds
By DEB O'ROURKE
As rain drizzles onto the old stone cobbles outside the Law Society of Upper Canada on Queen West this August 21, Six Nations activists are giving the org, to which every Ontario lawyer belongs, a back-to-school history lesson.
It's being taught by Janie Jamieson, one of the originators of the ongoing Caledonia reclamation. She charges that the venerable society, founded in 1797, was funded in part by money stolen from the Six Nations trust.
"Canada has a deep-rooted history in regards to its illegal activity and discrimination against Indians," she says, addressing 30 supporters outside the Law Society's building.
Jamieson's argument comes from Six Nations perusal of archival Indian Affairs records. These, Aboriginal legal experts say, demonstrate clearly that money raised by the Crown through selling or leasing Six Nations land in the 18th and 19th centuries and supposedly held in trust for them was siphoned off to many government projects, with no record of repayment.
Among these were cash payments made to fund budding municipalities and various public works and a mystery 1847 transfer in the amount of $1,000 to the Law Society of Upper Canada.
"Our money was used to run many projects that created this country," says Six Nations' Philip Monture, who has spent 30 years researching issues related to land rights.
"Between the 1830s and Confederation, our money was used to start running the country. There were no financial institutions per se that were creating revenues like Six Nations lands were. We built a lot of the infrastructure within the province of Ontario today, and we've got no returns for it."
At Indian and Northern Affairs , media rep Patricia Valladao responds that a lot of complex historical issues are at stake, and ongoing negotiations between Six Nations and government are a painstaking process. "The parties have to work through these challenging issues," she says, "but the use of the media in negotiations is not conducive to a peaceful and timely result."
And the Law Society itself? The organization exists, it says, to uphold the "independence, integrity and honour of the legal profession." It's made its home in Osgoode Hall, famous for its ghosts, but it seems unaware of this embarrassing skeleton rattling in its closet.
"The issue predates Confederation, and the Law Society is conducting a search of archival records,'' says spokesperson Susan Tonkin. "We don't have all the necessary information available yet."
Native rights lawyer Chris Reid, attending the rally, points out, "One of the issues we've raised both in the case of Caledonia and in the case of the Ardoch Algonquins and uranium is the failure of Canada and the government of Ontario to respect their own law and the many treaties or agreements that have been made with Indian nations."
A sign carried by a tall Mohawk man puts the argument succinctly: "Break a treaty break a law."
Meanwhile on the campaign trail, Conservative John Tory steps into Mike Harris's brimstone-scented tracks in this election with a promise of zero tolerance for Aboriginal occupations.
Tory is using the oldest trick in the New World: turning legitimate native protestors into criminals in the eyes of the public. In this day and age, governments accomplish this by stalling on landclaim negotiations and then relying on the courts to grant injunctions. It's a strategy that the Ipperwash Inquiry found repugnant.
Caledonia demonstrators defying a court order faced a violent OPP raid a year ago last April, holding lands they never relinquished.
The Algonquin today face similar issue in their anti-uranium blockade at Sharbot Lake near Kingston."Every time a judge has made an injunction against indigenous people, it has led to more violence against us,'' says Robert Lovelace, a former Ardoch Algonquin chief who is showing his support at the Law Society protest.
As the protest winds down, lawyer Sarah Dover offers to take demonstrators to see the Law Society's replica of the two-row wampum a document in the form of a beaded belt, one of the earliest treaties between European settlers and the Haudenosaunee, the centuries-old Iroquois confederacy.
A motley crew bearing cameras, signs and a baby, we file in past three skittish security officers. Even the baby is walked through the metal detector. We tiptoe upstairs, through a maze of marble, mahogany and tapestry.
A couple of demonstrators point upward. Glowing above our heads, embedded in a stained glass window, are images of wampum belts. Like the relationship between Canada and the Iroquois, these windows and this building are older than Canada. Like Osgoode Hall itself, the rule of law is built on earlier foundations.
In a quiet back stairwell, we find the replica wampum, presented when Mohawk Michael Mitchell of Akwesasne was called to the bar. Two parallel beaded rows represent the two sovereign nations: the canoe of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and the boat of the settler peoples from other parts of the world who came to stay. Though they travel the same river, they don't intertwine or merge. Two parallel lines move forward, side by side together.

I have never, repeat: NEVER - understood the relationship between Jews in America and the Demorat party when it comes to support for Israel. I still do not understand that skewed relationship and their apparent abandonment of that country and their lack of insistence on the firm and strong link between Israel and America.

What BZ said.
I left a comment at Flopping Aces, Wordsmith. Excellent post!
Perhaps American Jews have simply quit caring about Israel. What else could it be?
I don't understand it either Wordsmith. It is the same way with black people voting democrat. Republicans have done more for them, but their prejudices and preconcieved notions are stuck in their brains and that is all they allow themselves to see.
Jews will give Obama 72% of their vote, according to latest pollng.
After centuries of being persecuted in the name of Christianity, they just do not trust mixing government and religion, rightly or wrongly.
As traditional underdogs, they stick up for the disenfranchised -bleeding hearts, as they say.
As minorities they distrust all government and view liberal politics as more open to their POV.
..just an opinion, of course....

Photo by Matt Mallams.Rainbows form in the mist from the waterfall in the distance. Patches of red soil contrast with the dark green foliage of native lonomea and koa trees. This valley looks primeval, pristine, the sort of place you’d expect to see in Jurassic Park. That’s because Olokele Canyon on Kaua‘i is just that sort of place: a setting for many of the scenes in the film Jurassic Park. Until recently its steward had kept this privately owned area kapu—off-limits—to outsiders..
Keith Robinson’s friends call him Curmudgeous robinsonii because the conservationist who’s worked for thirty years to protect Hawai‘i’s endangered native plants is a maverick: reclusive, eccentric, opinionated. He co-owns the island of Ni‘ihau and 4,500 acres on Kaua‘i with his brother, Bruce, and he frequently tangles with Hawai‘i’s environmental community —the US Fish & Wildlife Service, the Audubon Society, the Sierra Club—over managing the flora living in this valley, much of which is endemic and endangered.
In 2007 Robinson opened up this remote area of Kaua‘i and collaborated with Safari Helicopters to run eco-tours that would fund his conservation work. Visitors touch down on a landing pad overlooking the canyon where Robinson, who often leads the tours personally, greets his guests wearing his trademark green hard hat and patched jeans. While the tour doesn’t go down into the canyon itself, visitors will see critically endangered plants like the palm Pritchardia aylmer-robinsonii (named for Keith’s uncle); only two are left on its native Ni‘ihau. There are the native Hawaiian cotton, Gossypium tomentosum, and the increasingly rare naupaka shrub Scaevola gaudichaudii, among many others.

Pot-smoking Driver in Saskatoon Deemed Not Impaired

A urine sample was also taken and confirmed that the woman had used marijuana.
However, the judge was not convinced there was any evidence that the woman’s driving ability was impaired.
If marijuana is ever legalized, they’ll need to figure out a way to determine intoxication levels easily, and indeed decide what constitutes impairment under the influence of it…

What we're watching – Cain goes for 10th victory
Jul 1, 2009, 4:20 PM EDT
- The Yankees will go for a seventh straight win against a pitcher they
tried to acquire in the second half of last year, Jarrod Washburn. They
beat the Mariners 8-5 on Tuesday to improve to 22-14 at new Yankee
Stadium. Washburn, who had an impressive 2.82 ERA in six starts against
the Bombers at the old yard, will be pitching at the new park for the
first time. Andy Pettitte will start for the Yankees. The Mariners are
one of two AL teams he’s under .500 against in his career (9-11, 4.68
ERA). Cleveland is the other.
- Cole Hamels and Jair Jurrjens will try to snap winless skids
tonight with the Phillies in Atlanta. Neither picked up a victory
during interleague play. Hamels, who last won on June 4, was removed
after just 4 2/3 innings last time out in a loss to Toronto. Jurrjens
has lost four in a row since his last victory on May 29.
Game of the Night
San Francisco vs. St. Louis – Matt Cain had two chances to become
the NL’s first 10-game winner, but he was undone in part by poor run
support, giving Jason Marquis a chance to beat him there. He’ll settle
for being the second to reach the mark if he can win in St. Louis
tonight. The Cardinals, who are trying to avoid dropping three straight
to begin a four-game series, will counter with their eight-game winner,
Adam Wainwright. St. Louis lost night despite getting a pair of homers
from Albert Pujols. Pujols is 4-for-8 with a homer and a double against
Cain in his)

NAZI "BUDDHISTS" IN SRI LANKA FUCK OFF! and CHRISTIANS IN THE ZENDO!
Here are some "Buddhists" who don't have a fucking clue what Buddhism is all about.
This story just disgusts me to no end. I have no idea what the fuck is up with these so-called "Buddhists" in Sri Lanka. But I do not represent them and I want nothing at all to do with jack-offs like this. I hope they ban my books over there too. This kind of nonsense makes me embarrassed to call myself a "Buddhist."
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (the hardline "Buddhist" ruling party in Sri Lanka) can bite me! More power to you Sarah Malini Perera. This shit makes me want to convert to Islam too!
How's that for a typical Brad Warner style reasoned argument?
ANYWAY, the 2010 Southern Dharma Retreat Center Zen retreat with Brad is now done. So let me tell you about it.
I counted 18 or 19 brave souls up there in the mountains of North Carolina. As always this was a very interesting group. People come to Zen retreats for all kinds of reasons. One woman was a born-again Christian and missionary to Africa who wanted to check out this Zen stuff. One other woman was drafted in by her friend when her friend's daughter who'd originally signed up came down with strep throat. One guy went to Woodstock. One guy was a Rinzai priest (the enemy!).
Someone asked about doing zazen retreats for the "wrong reasons" or something like that. But I don't think there are wrong reasons. If you just come along to experience three days of peace and quiet away from the job and the kids, that's just as valid as someone who's all gung-ho about The Great Way of the Buddha. Maybe more so.
It was a bit of a hard retreat for me because I caught a cold on the first day. It was all I could do to just get through all the talks and stuff without keeling over. I felt a little bad about that. To make up for my lack of energy I read the group the intro to my new book, which takes place at the Southern Dharma Retreat Center.
See, last year, just before that retreat I'd been dumped by a woman I was truly crazy about (perhaps literally so). And I was feeling pretty broke up the entire time. I figured that story would be a good intro to a book about sex and zen. The rest of the book is less personal than that. I guess that's kinda sad for all the anonymous commenters who got all worked up that the book was gonna be a big catalog of my sex life. Maybe next time.
Did I mention I got recognized by random people while I was in Austin -- twice? No? It's true. The first one was a college student on Spring Break who turned around as we waited for a light to change and asked my name. I thought he was gonna try to sell me something! Turns out he's an avid reader of this blog! I'm sorry I've forgotten your name if you're reading this. But I forget names as fast as I learn them. The next was a guy at a CVS. This is getting spooky! (Hence the photo above)(It's a joke)(The star is for H.B. Warner, a popular star of the 30s now sadly forgotten)
This weekend I'll be in Brooklyn at the Zen Center there running a retreat. There's still space available. All info is on this link here.
Then I'll be at Sheppard College in West Virginia. The date is April 8th, but I don't have the other specifics yet. Then it's on to Baltimore and following that, Richmond, Virginia. So be there or be a Sri Lankan hardline "Buddhist!"
(And this: Oh my God(zilla)!)

Re: Daigan's comment -- Folks, it actually IS!
As I previously commented about control.

The rest doesn't matter.
If Islam is so desperate as to accept s Perera as a convert, then all Buddhists throughout the world should be praying for their survival on an hourly schedule.
From the story you linked to, Brad, her arrest appears to be due to some violation of Sri Lanka's export laws and/or postal regulations. Many countries, including many west European countries, have very strict laws governing the import and export of items for sale. It looks like she was trying to illegally ship books out of the country without paying some kind of tax or duty or some other fee, or otherwise trying to get around some regulation she thought she could get away with getting around.
Nazism is serious business. Accusing people of Nazism should only be done for some good reason. For starters you should have some idea of what the fuck you are talking about.
You can find more news about her if you use another spelling of her name: Sarah Malani Perera.
Also, Sri Lanka is still emerging from a little thing called a Civil War -- which lasted for more than 25 years and which cost more than 80,000 lives. The people that the Sri Lankan government were fighting against were literally the inventors if suicide bombing as we know it.
None of the news reports, including the one Brad linked to, give an official reason for her arrest. Therefore all claims that she was arrested "for offending Buddhism" are purely speculative. And screaming about NAZIS on the basis of such speculation is bullshit.
Brad is using Nazi in the metaphorical sense of the word meaning "overly authoritarian."
It is thus commonly used on the Left Coast.
Of course the German National Socialists were talking socialism while being lap dogs to the corporatists.
We have the anti-socialist party in America being the lap dogs of corporatists (e.g. the republican fascists).
"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power." -- Benito Mussolini

Hey kids (sorry about the suckahs thing, I couldn't bring myself to shout out #1 like a f-in loosah), I just updated my google profile with a new pic that should amaze even Mysterion (one meter, schmeter). Just click on my blue name and all will be revealed!
Now, Alan, that's entertainment (if not attainment, schmattainment..:).
I'm more interested in the Christian who attended the retreat...especially a "born again" Christian who was a missionary in Africa. That's pretty hardcore. Wonder what she was looking for?
By the way, Brad...I always seem to miss you when you visit the Austin Zen Center!!! Maybe I'll run into you next year...
john e mumbles,

Wow! Bee-uti-Full photos, Alan! I only perused the front page but will take more time and look.
Thanks so much. Very Cool!
Wow! Never thought I'd hear about Buddhist fundamentalist. That is really fucked up!
Hmm.
The idea that a country could elevate Buddhism to a national religion is one thing. The fact that buddhists who arguably should know better could go along with that dicta is entirely another thing...
On the other hand--delusion is delusion, and no one is exempt.
The Sri Lankans are not alone.
Ever go to Thailand and make bawdy jokes about their royalty in a public forum?
About the Rinzais being the enemy..
An old zen monk one day told me: "The Christian idea about loving your enemy is a joke. The real challenge is to love your brother" :)
We here sometimes get in touch with the rinzais. Just some weeks ago they invited us (the Soto guys) for together watching the Dogen movie at their place.
Apuleius,
An interesting point. I did take the news story at face value, and maybe I should question it. It would be interesting if this turned out to be a big PR stunt by the author.
But the very existence of something that can be called a "hardline Buddhist government" is ... I just have no words for how absurd that sounds.
Also, the article title is a reference to the old Dead Kennedys song "Nazi Punks Fuck Off". The DKs were not accusing the punks of actually being Nazis, but of acting like fascists.
Honest, the last 13 years has been Soto all the way! (Was facing the inside of the room while being time keeper that is "Rinziaesque"?)
It was a very intimate Sesshin. I mailed my application to Great Sky Sesshin. I will get an extra can of "spray on Soto" from Target.
I'm floored that such a thing as "hardline Buddhist nationalists" actually exist. I never would have guessed.
BTW, I'm friends with your pal Sean Saley - I told him you were coming to town (Wash DC area), and he said drop him a line...
Allison
Concerning Sarah Malini Perera: It's true that the article looks very bad on the face of it. But I am by nature paranoid, and when I see a news item that tries to make Buddhists look bad I automatically assume Opus Dei is behind it.
So far there is still very little information, at least in English, available about what is really going on. And as far as I can tell, no one had ever heard of this "author" until a couple days ago.
Sarah Malini Perera has lived in Bahrain, where she converted to Islam, since 1985. In Bahrain Islam is the official state religion. Shia Muslims are the majority, but the country is dominated politically and economically by Sunni Muslims. All religious groups in Bahrain must obtain a license from the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. All anti-Islamic writings are prohibited by law in Bahrain. Women only received the right to vote and to stand in elections in 2002 in Bahrain (in Sri Lanka women got the right to vote in 1931, just 11 years after the US).
If Sri Lanka is home to "Buddhist Fundamentalism" then we need to develop a whole new vocabulary for talking about Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc.
Isn't it nice of the Sri Lankans to show how any religion, even Buddhism, can be used as an excuse to oppress and judge others.
i don't think this a new occurence though, right? didn't buddhists support hirohito during world war 2?
also, taoism had a huge military cult in china called the yellow turban sect, and if taoists can go fundamentalist, any religion can.
I had a Dead Kennedy's T-shirt back in the day that said "Too Drunk To Fuck". The DK's never intended that people take the message literally, just a public service announcement pointing out a potential occupational hazard.
well that takes care of birth control
and no need for the morning after pill either

OMG! Dont you know?
Once you go Rinzai
You never go back!
All organized religions seem like a scam to me, even the Buddhist ones. Some of the most beautiful places on earth are ruined by religious nonsense.
Ever think about putting out another D-13 album Brad?
hey john e...
I've had an interest in historical alchemy. Cool that you've written a book.
Do you know where the phrase "As Above So Below" originates? I thought I had read that it came out of an alchemical tradition.
yes,
from experience
coming down with a cold at the beginning of a sesshin sucks
the good part: sesshin (aside from samu and being tenzo helper is sitting quietly
and at the end of a 7 day sesshin
your cold is gone!
(bust be buddhist healing bajic!) (said while blowing nose)
a "too drunk to fuck" t-shirt? now THAT is awesome.
"holiday in cambodia ...
everybody dressed in BLACK!"
In general, crowds throwing rocks at someone, regardless of their religion scares me.
theres a whole lot of folks calling themselves buddhists in the world who may or may not actually know what the fuck they are talking about. Including me.
It was my understanding that while certain buddhists in japan supported the military regime in the 1930's that the regime itself made Shinto the official and sole state religion out of a fear that Buddhism would make it harder to whip up the kind of fanatical nationalism needed to conduct a 10+ year war.
Yeah, I cut the sleeves off, and the neck out, back then you had to make your own modifications, rips and tears and safety pin chic hadn't been co-opted by Wal-Mart (and Green Day -snap!) yet.
re; Anonymous said..."as above so below" -a whole appendix in my book is dedicated to the completely apocryphal info on that one. It IS the most famous alchemical phrase and basically sums up the whole thing nicely...
Just a note of thanks to Brad...
What a great retreat. It was nice to talk the "nuts and bolts" of Just Sitting with someone in the know. I actually woke up Monday morning and was sad that I wouldn't be spending 5 hours staring at the wall of a zendo.
If we're talking about the same person, I think the Christian at the retreat wound up there by accident, due to someone pulling out at the last minute due to sickness. I don't think that she participated much in the sitting.
It looks like she was trying to illegally ship books out of the country without paying some kind of tax or duty or some other fee.
Usually there's a duty or tax when importing, not when exporting. Most countries want to export as much as possible. So this explanation doesn't make sense to me.
was sad that I wouldn't be spending 5 hours staring at the wall of a zendo.
Five hours a day of zazen isn't much for a seshin. Did Brad fill up the rest of the time with talks, or did you take long walks in the woods?
Ray -- wrong Christian! One of them sat the whole darn thing!
5 or 6 hours zazen, with talks, meals, and time for walks in the woods is a pretty typical Dogen Sangha retreat, Jinz. (They're not silent either).
It was a retreat that was open to novices, and as such, the amount of time spent in the meditation hall was about right..in my opinion, at least. :-)
Thanks for the clarification, Brad..I was only aware of the lady that spoke up during introductions.
Someone who thinks Buddhism is tolerant and has never persecuted other religions isn't very familiar with their history.
In California (a different world) Jesuits who had 'lost their faith' would join Zen Retreats throughout the 70s. It's a kind of 'don't ask, don't tell' thing but, out here on the left coast, a lot of former Xtians use Buddhism as a one-step recovery program.
It's no secret that perhaps 1/3 of the cardinals have lost their faith.

Mrs. Beulah Bucklen, 59, of Charleston, W. Va., died last night, eight days after being bitten twice by a rattlesnake in a snake-handling ritual at Jesus Pentecostal Church at Frazier's Bottom in Putman County, near Charleston. Roscoe Bucklen, her husband, said he persuaded her to seek medical attention when she became violently iii the day after being bitten. Bucklen, who was sitting in his car outside the church when his wife was bitten, said: "I've seen that snake before. It's as big around as your arm. It hit her twice between the thumb and forefinger on the left hand. They had to pull the fangs from her."

This looks like fun. Absolutely LOADSA stuff about mean, vicious Buddhists.
1972 ??!! What the hell, have all the snake handlers gone to the rattler rapture? SALVATION ON SAND MOUNTAIN is an incredible read, for anyone curious about this very extreme form of Xtian worship. Also, HOLY GHOST PEOPLE, a film about snake fondlers and poison drinkers that I think parts of are on Youtube...SSSSssssssssssssssss......
Jinzang, are you arguing that Toyotomi Hideyoshi's ban on Christianity was because he was a Buddhist? From my reading, he was concerned by the Europeans who insisted upon combining business with Christian missionary activity, and he increasingly came to view such activity as dangerous and subversive both to his own rule and to Japanese society in general. Originally, Nobunaga had actually encouraged the foreign missionaries, owing probably to his desire to check the militant Buddhist sects that opposed him.

Don't be floored. This is a reaction to the invasion of Islam. Fundie Xtianity and Fundie Islam share dualism. They are right and any and all others are wrong.
1972 - Ceylon changes its name to Sri Lanka and Buddhism given primary place as country's religion, further antagonising Tamil (Hindu) minority.
the Tamils of Ceylon
Strictly speaking, the Tamil (Vel) people invaded Ceylon from the North. Ceylon was originally a land of the Dravidians. Archeology has confirmed this a number of times over during the last 50 years.
wikipedia
So there is a conflict between those who were long ago invaded and those who invaded 2,300 years ago.
Same everywhere. Everywhere, the same.
Ist das nicht richtig?
Or they're not "in the spirit" or whatever. Regardless, it takes balls of steel to pick up and hold a huge pissed off timber rattler and dance around with a bunch of other people shouting and clapping and stomping their feet "in the spirit."
It strikes me that 100 reported cases is not all that many...besides, this is something the Hopi people have done for millennia to ensure rain for their corn harvest. My old alchemy teacher Jean Dubuis used to say "Big trouble equals big reward."
And John Lennon sang "whatever gets you through the night."
It's alright, it's alright.
To whom it may concern,
For a bunch of people who sit around staring at a blank wall for a significant portion of their lives, casting aspersions on people who dance around with snakes seems kind of strange.
The snake stuff at least sounds kind of interesting.
It might even be more dangerous:-)
Jeeeez.
Cheers.
all right, I deleted snake bites.
Dakhinathupa in Anuradhapura is currently identified by archeologists as a Buddhist temple and NOT the mythical tomb of 2nd century BCE Tamil king Elara.
When a new culture arrives, they claim that the preexisting stuff was theirs. The Aztecs claimed Olmec structures, the Xtians claimed Mithraic and Ptolemic stuff, Islam claimed the Hindu (Qube - Kaaba).
Chinese Buddhism - and its Japanese offspring - are somewhat distant from the Pali Tripitaka. After all, China had to integrate Taoism and the remnants of Confucianism into their Buddhist Traditions. And both Jodo Shu(Pure Land) and Jodo Shinshu (New Pure Land) introduce a Christianized 'heaven' concept where none exists upstream.
One day, I plan to introduce "New, Improved Pure Land Buddhism." But first I must decide on the art work and logo.
How about:
"Marked improvement in liturgy does not disturb famous Buddhist simplicity."
Islam is like the borg. Once the followers reach a certain size they wipe out all other religions. Could Brad do what he is doing in any country with Muslim majority? It was the growth of Islam that led to destruction of several buddhist centers in different parts of Asia. No other religion is allowed to operate freely in Islamic countries. Even Zazen will be banned. Then what will you do?
Buddhism's like the Borg too. So many times in dharma talks I've heard the sentiment "resistance is futile".
On behalf of my previous link to vicious Buddhists, I apologise for the many dead links therein - but if you're keen and persistent you'll find many that do work, and seem to confirm this to be true.
In islamic countries, you sit ZAZEN on the toilet.
Alan, I could look at your photos all day.. Really interesting!
And for the ladies...
Actually, the Xtian fundies have the same concept for America - forced conversion to the Xtian religion (which is borrowed from Buddhism).
There is plenty of ignorance to go around.
"A careful comparison, word by word, sentence by sentence shows that the Christian Gospels are Pirate-copies of the Buddhist Gospels. God's word, therefore, is originally Buddha's word."

It's only entertainment. I know for an absolute fact that the only reason they have any appeal at all is their novelty.
If more people were doing this kind of stuff, it would be a huge yawn.
I read someone who was quoting Susan Sontag on photography to the effect that the first person who took a picture of Half Dome had it easy.
Any photograph would hold great excitement.
The following photographers have the harder job, to re-imagine a scene that becomes more and more known with each new photograph.
Saw your work. You are doing exciting things with color. I'll have to show it to my wife, she is the Rothko fangirl in the family.
Cheers.
I've done zazen in Jordan, which is a predominantly Muslim country. I had a conversation about Buddhism in the hotel restaurant late at night (one of the other musicians in the orchestra asked me.) Also, I saw THIS internet cafe.
There are Christians and Jews in Jordan, so I imagine there could be some Buddhists, but there might not be any.

You know the old Buddhist saying:
""Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity."
The moment fighting starts, peace is lost. A generation after the fighting stops, peace may be restored - unless the parents teach their children bigotry..
This looks like fun.
The Trimondis are not a valid source of information about Tibetan Buddhism. For example, they write this:.
This is caricature, if not outright slander, not sober analysis.
There is at least one Buddhist in Jordan right now. Her name is Katy.
The Trimondis are not a valid source of information about Tibetan Buddhism.
Oooh! My link! Let me defend it!
From the brief tour I made of their site, Jinz, it is clear that the Trimondis have an agenda: "Buddhism - if it will become congruent with western values like democracy, human rights, equality of gender etc. must be “reinvented” The condition therefore is an open, critical and honest debate", they write.?
The site links to very many articles - must be over 50, by no means all written by the Trimondis - which I think are useful in challenging our wishful thinking about "Buddhism" as a world religion...many of which back up your original point:
Someone who thinks Buddhism is tolerant and has never persecuted other religions isn't very familiar with their history.
Jinzang.
I haven't read much of the comments but I came upon M's quote: "Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity".
I think virginity is usually produced by only one means.
Else than this I think we’ve been there before.
Somewhat before Jundo.
I’m sure a few can still recall. Hasn’t been that long.
Or it has been quite long, in a way..
As above, so below.
Then Thich Nhat Hanh is an idiot, as peace does not equate to the end of suffering.
Extremist Islam is a cancer that should be scalded with boiling water, and that women is a proponent of it.
Oh Brad, sick 'em!
You are quite dashing in that pic by the Hwood star!! :)
Any more details on the event at Sheppard College in West Virginia? April 8th is tomorrow and I would definitely be interested in attending.
AHEM!! As Above, So Below! Respect!!
Well said
I was reading the Dhammapada when I heard about the trouble in Sri Lanka. I hope the JHU finds time to reflect on scripture in the midst of their troubles.
I don't know much about the Zen school, but your use of language seems to suggest klesha. I have heard that the Tibeatn can speak and act with a foul manner without klesha. I can't. :D
Righteous indignation is hypocrisy, are you the same as the JHU?
Be Well!

FLAT EARTH SOCIETY and MOTH
Over the last couple months while I've been traveling two more Dimentia 13 downloads have become available. I've been scurrying around too much to promote them like I should have been. So here goes:
FLAT EARTH SOCIETY
Flat Earth Society is Dimentia 13’s pop album. It was 1989 and I had been making Dimentia 13 records for five years. Two years before the first Dimentia 13 release I’d been a member of the hardcore punk band Zero Defex who had also been on a few compilation albums. After seven years in the music business at age 25 I had yet to be able to earn anything close to a living wage and I was getting desperate. It’s amazing how old you can feel at 25.
In spite of being known as a hardcore punk guy in Zero Defex and a psychedelic dude in Dimentia 13, I had always been interested in pure pop music for its own sake. In those days I wrote songs constantly. When preparing the Dimentia 13 records I tended to pick the most psychedelic pieces from among the dozens of demos I made each year. Or else I’d dress up the pop songs I wrote in psychedelic clothing, adding vintage Farfisa organs or Mellotrons or fuzztone guitars to disguise the goofball pop songs underneath. Which is what most of the original psychedelic bands of the Sixties did anyway.
By the late 80s a lot of vaguely psychedelic and overtly Sixties inspired bands were selling records and getting noticed by the emerging “alternative” scene — bands like REM, Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians, The Stone Roses, and a boatload of others now long since forgotten. I wanted a piece of that action. So I decided to tone down those elements I felt were tying Dimentia 13 to the narrow confines of garage/psych revival scene. There would be no Mellotrons or Farfisa organs, no sitars or backwards tapes, the fuzztone guitars would take on a more contemporary sound, and I would admit musical influences and lyrical references from after 1967.
I also worked out a new guitar sound I was particularly proud of. I bought a giant red hollow bodied Eko guitar, made in Italy in the late Sixties and plugged it into both a bass and a guitar amp at the same time, added some vintage spring reverb and turned it up to seventeen. In the studio it sounded amazing. Unfortunately that sound didn’t transfer well to tape. You get a hint of how awesome it was on the James Bond theme-inspired riffing of album’s first song Can This Be True Love but elsewhere it gets lost.
The band on this album was me on lead vocals and lead guitar, Jeff Lisk on drums, Joe Nofziger on bass, and Louanne Varholick on vocals and keyboards. Jeff was a hot shit drummer in Chicago at the time. He was very good and he knew it. His playing on the record is really sharp and precise, but it's a little too clean for my tastes these days. Joe had been my best friend since seventh grade and kindly drove all the way up to Milwaukee from Columbus, Ohio to play on the album. Louanne had been the bassist on the previous album, Disturb The Air. But she was a better keyboard player and singer so I had her do what she did best instead of being hampered with the bass, which she was never all that enthusiastic about. The musicianship on this album is far tighter and more professional than on the previous Dimentia 13 records.
I hoped the resulting album would help me break out of the tight bound confines of the pysch genre and maybe even make some money. In the end, though, it didn’t sell any better than the previous Dimentia 13 records. In fact, it did a little worse than the albums that came before. In the end, it was the final album I put out on Midnight Records.
It took me a long time to start liking this album again. At the time of its release I thought it was great. But when it met with poor sales and critical indifference I started looking at it as a failure, a reminder of a bad time in my life and a misguided attempt to sell out and be commercial. Nowadays I can listen to it and enjoy it, but for years I couldn’t.
These days I sometimes play a couple songs from this album when I give talks about my books. Buddha Was A Good Ol' Boy always gets a laugh and God Pt. III, which I also play at speaking gigs sometimes, is a prototype for some of the topics I write about these days. In fact the lyrics on most of the album are really philosophical and very much inspired by the Zen training I’d been going through for close to a decade by then.
Here to tempt you into buying the album are two tracks that I had intended to include as bonus tracks on the download. I’m not sure why I didn’t. I think I just spaced out and forgot to send them to the people at Smog Veil Records who arranged the download. The good news is that you now can have them absolutely free of charge. Hopefully they will act like the first taste of crack a dealer gives you and make you need to buy the rest.
SKULL SHINING
This instrumental was meant to be a bonus track on the original CD release. But it never made it on there and I don’t remember why. It’s based on a riff I once heard the Meat Puppets play. It’s also the most overtly psychedelic song recorded during the album sessions. So maybe that’s why it was left off. I like it a lot now and if I could I would make this the first song on the album.
TELL ME WHERE SHE’S GONE
This is probably the most overtly pop song recorded for the album. Again, I don’t recall why it was dropped. In fact, I didn’t even remember recording it for the album until I found it on a cassette about a year ago. I remember thinking at the time I wrote the song that it had the potential to become a college radio hit. So why would I have left it off the record? Who knows? Anyway, I was especially proud of ripping off one of the riffs from the 70s prog rock masterpiece Hocus Pocus by the Dutch band Focus in the middle section.
MOTH
This was the final album I recorded as Dimentia 13 for Midnight Records. It was never released by them, though, because I had a huge argument with the record label. I felt like I deserved to be treated better. In retrospect they treated me pretty fairly. It’s just that they were never very open with me about what they were doing. Whatever.
I remember trying to correct some of the mistakes I’d made on Flat Earth Society with this record. I was no longer so obsessed with making a contemporary sounding album. So some of the overtly psychedelic sounds I’d eliminated on Flat Earth Society are allowed to return. The result is a much more balanced album. It’s still more of a pop album than the early Dimentia 13 records. But it’s truer to what I really wanted to hear.
Because of the disputes with Midnight Records, this album was never really finished. I made a mix that I submitted to Midnight. But it was awful. I was trying to recapture the sound that Glen Rehse had created when he produced the Disturb The Air album. But I didn’t really know how he accomplished it. So I just overloaded every track with reverb and echo until the whole thing sounded like it had been recorded in a cave. It was a murky depressing sound and for years I thought of this as a murky depressing album.
Then late in 2009 when I was cleaning out some old boxes I came across a cassette of rough mixes for the album. These were created as reference mixes to guide in making the final mixes later. I told the engineer to simply make all of the tracks we recorded audible and not add any effects. When I listened to these again I discovered that the album itself was not murky and depressing at all. It was just all that reverb and shit I added on later.
For the currently available download version, I used these rough mixes and ran them through a digital mixing system to bring out some of the nuances. The only song on which I used the mix I had considered “final” back in 1991 was Anjalina. The rest are rough mixes.
The band on this album was the live version of Dimentia 13 as it existed in 1991. I sang lead vocals and tortured the guitars. Joe Nofziger, my best friend since seventh grade plays bass and sings backing vocals, and Steve McKee, once the drummer of my favorite Akron-based punk band The F-Models plays drums.
The lyrics are a kind of autobiographical rock opera about my return to Akron after three years in Chicago. But that would have been such an incredibly mundane subject for a rock opera that I never let anyone know that’s what it was. The Pamela Song is about a girl I dated in Akron. The Calico Girl in the song of that name is someone I left behind in Chicago. That same girl is also the subject of Panther.
Anjalina isn’t about a girl at all, but is about my friend Jim Bradler who had died a few years before very suddenly when he was only 25 years old. The song lists off a whole string of phrases he used to say, like “give me her number.”
Precious One is my attempt at writing a Badfinger song. But I was too embarrassed to use the original heart-on-my-sleeve romantic lyrics I’d written and instead wrote a bunch of psychedelic sounding nonsense. Love Song '73 was my attempt to write the kind of song The Partridge Family might have played in 1973. Again it’s about someone I knew. Walk Like An Insect contains my poor attempt to do a rap about the then-current state of the country. Another Song About Heaven is a parody of the band Warrant, who were huge at the time. The reason I wrote a Warrant parody is because Joe had been in a band called Blu whose drummer Steve Chamberlin had moved to California and joined Warrant. We’d both been friends with Steve and were kind of amazed by this.
Honey I'm Your Ghost was an attempt to write a Cramps song. Lux Interior was from Akron. Smash Your Head was about the frustrations of trying to make it in the music business. Somehow all of this stuff related to Akron and what was happening in my life there at the time.
I still really like this album. I know it sounds egotistical to give your own record a glowing review. But I was trying to write and record songs that I personally liked. So, of course I’m gonna like them! But I feel like this is a happy, upbeat album even though some of the specific subject matter is not. It’s an album about fighting the good fight even when you feel like you’re probably going to lose in the end.
Here is my favorite song from the MOTH LP, available for free on this here blog to hopefully make you feel guilty enough to buy the rest:
Anjalina

Well, as the "outside independent member", I would like to offer a seat to my brother Brad, if he would have it. Seriously, I cannot think of anyone who would be a better candidate for that, and it would be a great bridge so that people can see that the things between him and me were a tempest in a teapot. So, consider it hereby officially offered, and I ask you to talk with him about it and see if you can get him to accept. He would not have to be involved in monitoring every post, but any member could write to him with a complaint and he would investigate and write about it as he wishes. I think it a nice idea. Please talk with him about it, as it is a serious offer.
If not, I will try to find an unrelated, respected Zen teacher (not related to Genpo! :-) )who might step in in that role.
I will keep you informed of how the rest of the board is set up, and I expect you will post about it.

Dude, Anjalina is awesome.
It's cool how the balance between retro-psychedelic and dance pop ended up with some good old new wave punk like Anjalina. I love that kind of stuff.
"A courtyard common to all will be swept by none."
True enough Seagal.. The Godless Commies never sweep their courtyards except when threatened by force.
Taigu posted this on the treeleaf site. - [Taigu, teacher at Treeleaf Sangha, was born in 1964, started Zazen early and received Shukke Tokudo in 1983 at age 18 from Rev. Mokudo Zeisler of the Deshimaru Lineage. Received Dharma Transmission from Chodo Cross in 2003. Now resides in Osaka, Japan.]
This seems odd.. at least to me, that Mike Cross, who was basically told by Jundo Cohen that he needed psychiatric care after he was booted out of Dogen Sangha, decides that Pierre Turler has what it takes to be a teacher in his former teacher's tradition. Then Pierre partners up with the same Jundo Cohen at Treeleaf after Jundo is booted from DS. Does this make any sense at all? Why did Taigu go to Mike Cross for his transmission and Jundo Cohen for students? If this was a job resume I wouldn't hire him.
Because they are the sane, wise and gifted ones in the disfunctional crazy family? That also explain a lot of the jealousy directed toward them around here and in DS,
Now I know already 3 people of Dogen-Sangha (or at least former DS participants, regarding Jundo)who would need psychiatric care!!!
Every organization has different ways to handle people !
As far as I know Nishijima, he is not the one who recommends psychiatric care for his students.
And I can't get this impression from Brad either.
re: the music.
Good stuff.
I liked it.
Jundo! Have you lost your mind?
Why are you always posting your personal things in this blog?
Collecting soldiers? Lost Brads email-adress?
You got dharma-transmission?
For what? Holding Nishijimas hand, when he signed the documents?
Man, even Seagal Rinpoche is a little more joyful than you.

"Buddhism ia based in the psychological grammar that says we cannot eliminate the so-called negative forces of afflictive emotions. The only way to work with them is to encounter them directly, enter their world, and transform them.
Thus, according to Buddhist psychology, anger can be transformed into mirrorlike wisdom or clarity; pride can be transformed into equalizing or equanimity and generosity; desire can be transformed into discriminating wisdom or discernment; jealousy can be transformed into unhindered wisdom or enlightened activity; and ignorance can be transformed into the wisdom of our True Nature, or clear and energetic intelligence."

"So there's hope for everybody."
Hi,
There sure is; too much in some cases we need hardly mention. However, the "psychological grammar" of hope might not be all it's cracked up to be... sincere effort, on the other hand...
Regards,
Harry.
Sincere effort is sooo hard.. Hope on the other hand is so easy a child can do it.
Hi Anon,
I find that kids, up to a certain age (sometimes 9, sometimes 90), are much more direct and honest than 'hope'. I find that they just want things straight away and if they can't get 'em straight away, rather than hang around pissing everybody off with their wonderful, elaborate 'hopes' (that are just extended, complicated 'wants'?) they bawl their eyes out, stamp their feet, scream and shout, call us adults evil, hurtful bastards... and then just get over it.
Regards,
Harry.
Back in the cassette culture days I used to write reviews of all kinds of independent musical releases for SOUND CHOICE and OPTION mags. If I couldn't find a way to say something nice about the tunes, I would always find something to compliment the musicians on, knowing myself how much blood sweat and tears goes into recording. In that vein, I have to say that the album cover artwork on both Flat Earth Society and Moth is excellent!
Harry: Hope is dope.
John E: You ain't that good yourself old son. But you got a hell of a haircut.
Dope indeed.
...BTW, I'm having a funny exchange over on the About.com Buddhist blog with Zen Master Barbera there arising from her post about one of Brad's posts here:
It involves koans and the role of the language/expression of realisation and non-realisation. Rinz, you might get a kick out of it, seeing two Sotoist ley bums floundering around like hapless self appointed Zen authorities.
Regards,
Harry.
Dear Jundo,
You wrote: ."
That describes my condition too. I have post-trauma stress-condition which is essentially a disregulation of the part of my nervous system I can't control. It resulted from experiencing some significant physical injuries from accidents in childhood. Although I'm now receiving therapy, when my system is 'activated' by a stressful event I charge up with energy and become disconnected from how my body feels. I also interpret things suspiciously, act more aggressively, and say and do things I wish I didn't, etc. Later I will 'collapse' with exhaustion and feel unmotivated for extended periods.
I don't know if your friend has the same condition, but from your description that person might be interested to read about the kind of therapy I am receiving:

Hayzus Christi, Harry. You've got alot of time on your hands. Put them to better use and you and Barbara get a F'in room...
Rinz, Anything you read is read subjectively, you can't help but read it "your way." How you read it is simply how YOU read it.
One person's "words divorced from practice don't mean anything" is another's poetry.
I find Babs assertion that you shouldn't read sutras without an advanced zen person to guide you a little odd. This is exactly what many fundamentalist christians say about the bible. Reading it on your own may even lead you to unbelief, so you should have a theologian or preacher standing by to interpret everything for you so that you don't misunderstand. Presumably we need a mullah handy before we can read the quran too. Perhaps we need a genuine advanced communist available before we read the works of Marx and Engels. So you need an orthodox soto zennist standing over your shoulder telling you exactly what Dogen meant by xy or z.
I don't buy it. I do think a strong zen practice is important to understand either the sutras or writings of any old master, including Dogen. But to suggest it requires someone to interpret it so that there's no misunderstanding seems to enforce orthodoxy to the nth degree. Perhaps the 'adnvanced zen person' herself has misunderstood the whole point of a text. Who gets to determine who is advanced or who has misunderstood? I keep expecting Babs to say; "Ahhh Grasshopper..."
Barbera said wanted: "a teacher who has good understanding of dharma."
So who is it? Brad, Jundo or anonymous?."
Delusion mixed with realization. Defilement with purity. Throwing them both out and overturning the bowl sounds like a good zen answer but it points to an attachment to emptiness, a one-sided view. Such a throwing away leaves no way for buddha to actually function and save all beings. What will the community eat? The adept must be able to drink the milk and leave the poison though they are mixed in one bowl.

In your three posts in this blog you are critical of three different people. Telling Brad his music isn't that great, telling Harry he has too much time on his hands, and telling Rinz the one true way to read....
That's impressive man....R u that critical of everyone in real life?
This blog has become so boring.
Fuck it, I was having a really bad day. Thanks for pointing that out Anonymous. My apologies to all.

I'm nothing more than an ANONYMOUS CUMSHOT, so take this for what it's worth:
Jundo's behavior over on "Reblogging Brad Warner" shows that, if anything, he's regressing and becoming even more childish (in a not-good way) and passive-aggressive.
And to think he and the other one are about to start cranking out Zen cybermonks.
"Baraka", anyone seen it?
Yeah, I liked in and you probably will too, as long as you like the music of Philip Glass.
"Unmistaken Child" was also pretty cool. The high point of the movie is actually the shots of the beautiful Himalayan scenery.

If any of you fine folk at Treeleaf, and I believe there are many, want to take a peek into what someone very close to you has been up to recently, take a VERY CLOSE look at comments to Gniz's post, "Genpo and Jundo are not one the same." I think you might recognize one of the trolls over there.
He is posting from Japan.

Regarding the "best buddhist blogs" award this blog has gotten.. I looked over the list, and it seems that Brad is the only one who isn't completely nuts. Good job, Brad.
Some of you may think all of this dharma soap opera is a modern or american thing.
These are from a discussion about Shen Hui over on ZFI:
About Shen Hui:
"For him to say he cared nothing for his own life is a laugh! He wanted that robe and lineage for his own. He wanted to be the seventh patriarch. Later in his life he was involved in selling ordinations. Wanna be a monk? Pay enough and we'll ordain you on this platform, right here in this square!."
Then there's this from another site by Vladimir K on the Northern vs Southern Chan split:
"Although history has, in a sense, vindicated Shen-hui’s position, in many respects he was, at
best, a questionable (though highly effective) evangelist for Ch’an. He was not above making
up stories to promote Hui-neng and his “school”. He claimed that Bodhidharma and all
subsequent masters in the lineage taught the Diamond Sutra rather than the Lankavatara
Sutra, a claim Yampolsky (1967:34) dismisses as “pure fabrication.” Dumoulin (1994:113-
114) called him “unscrupulous” in his attacks on the Northern School. Shen-hui accused
Northern School practitioners of attempting to steal Bodhidharma’s robe, trying to cut off the
head of Hui-neng’s mummified body, effacing Hui-neng’s tomb inscription and altering the
inscription on Shen-hsiu’s stele to call him the Sixth Patriarch (Yampolsky, 1967:28-29;
Dumoulin, 1994:113-114) He also claimed that he was a tenth stage bodhisattva, a claim
Poceski judges as “outrageous”."
Wow. Selling ordination certificates. Is this any different than charging for Big Mind seminars?
To support the military too. What if Genpo gave his money from Big Mind seminars to George Bush to finance his invasion of Iraq?
Does Jundo claim that he's a 10th stage bodhisattva?
As the dharma turns.
You have testicles? Huh. Sure sounds like you're hatin' on Me, brutha. I ain't fat, except with love for you Rinz.

But what about people who get killed in violent attacks such as you faced. Did they also actually need to be killed or was it their true will to be dead?
If one believes in rebirth literally this theory could be logical, but I know you don't so please explain further.
Janne- Dont miss the point where Brad says "I only apply this to myself"
You cant think for another and you certainly cant think for the universe. you can look at your OWN life and try to make sense of that, but what I think brad is saying and I agree with myself is that this way of looking at the world can only be applied by YOU to YOURSELF, not ohers.
Even if you take a vow of silence, that too can and will be misinterpreted. Such is life.
Well said. I wish I could take a vow of silence, but everyone around me would just say "aww, he's being aloof", or "he must be mad at me".
Finally finished the new book. Love it. (X-cept fo' the goofy footnotes, he-he, ha-ha....but I realize that's just Brad's humor).
.”.
It doesn’t sound very sincere. And it doesn’t make sense, too.
I don’t believe you can’t apply it to others, and I have a good example of someone who did, successfully.
“I don't even care if this idea is objectively true or not. I believe it is or I wouldn't use it.” - What does this mean? (!)
I don’t know but this may be just the reason brad got this comment. KWIM.
(- and Janne, - how do you “know” - I’m kind of curious, - did Mysterion tell you?)
Once again...
Wise men talk because they have something to say; fools, because they have to say something.
Janne - I'm joking about Mysterion (btw, - talking about a vow of silence, - I mean, - just consider ...) but I am serious about the question. Not that important though.
Well Brad said himself:
"In fact in my case it didnt really fix much of anything. OK. A few nagging fears that had dogged me for ages were gone.. Yet you're not going to live forever either. Youre gonna be dead as a doornail someday and ain't nothin' gonna bring you back. You won't get reincarnated either."
Janne - .” - I could say this for myself too. And even if I could disappear this wouldn’t necessarily be frightening. I just wouldn't exist.
Second - I'm gonna be dead - but not as a doornail, doornails don't die in the first place.
- And - “You won't get reincarnated either”, - B is misleading you. - He is not going to. - Most people will. - He’s intentionally getting misunderstood. - Some do that too.
(I haven’t read the whole thing. I might want to but I easily get a headache.)
Years ago, at the time of the infected blood scandal, in France, a minister declared that she felt responsible yet not guilty. Immediately she was shot down in full flight by the media, who pretended that she was playing upon words. But the distinction was, I feel, important.
We have a share of responsibility in what happens to us. But we have to be careful into not transforming that into guilt. We are NOT guilty that thugs assult us. But we have to examine our responsibility in it.
I have stated this countless times, but I have had a very bad master in my trade, who was more interrested in humiliating me than in teaching me violin making. But I had been warned by my father not to trust him. And I had had quite a few warnings from the man's behaviour as well. So if I stuck with him, wasn't it that, through my desperation to learn violin making, I was providing the thug with the club with which to club me?
The real solution would have been to go somewhere else, but I chickened out because that would have meant going abroad, in a foreign land, having to starve and work hard outside the school to pay for my tuition fees and so on.
So the "buyers beware", in the end remains the only solution. What's more, Anonymous' attempts to drag Brad into the feud with Graham are counterproductive, since they just annoy those who are too far away to be able to do anything about it, and won't change anything to those who are still enthralled by the man. I have here, in my city, a Dharma "uncle" who might deserve a lot of criticism, but that won't deter his disciples, who think that his Dharma talks are "truly inspired" and would probably think mine are a tad too plain and down to earth.
wtf
Brad... I am surprised.
Disappointed and a little sickened too...
You seemed to find all the time in the world to go after Genpo and his scam, arguing over topics like what is enlightenment, and how you know that what Genpo is selling ain't it... Stuff, that is arguably hard to pin down.
But when it comes to things that are EASILY verified such as ordination papers - it just isn't worth your time???
Oh yeah?
Where is YOUR proof that you are ordained?
(and with that question, *BAM*, you can instantly substantiate your ordination right? Pictures of your papers? Pictures of your ordination ceremony? OF COURSE YOU CAN!)
Barry Dogo Graham has NEVER done this, even after being repeatedly asked!
Just by looking at the Raksu's he has done for people you can tell he is a sham!
You know Japan...? he claims (on Sitting Frog Zen website) that he trained "...at Butsudo Zen Center in Kyoto, Japan, where he received Dharma Transmission from Ando Yamashiro Roshi."
Is that hard for somebody that speaks Japanese to verify this??
I will NEVER for the life of me understand why teachers don't think that exposing fakers is important...
It's hard enough for a new student to figure what's what when first starting out on the Zen path, and having the proof, pictures, paper and pedigree is no guarantee that the teacher is a good one.
But THIS...
There has got to be a standard, a base line at least, to be able to tell if people are even what they say they are.
And most importantly, there has to be teachers who take it as their responsibility.
(And PS - Hawking your T shirts in a blog posting where the poster you quote is ripping on you for being more interested in hawking your t shirts than caring weather or not Barry Graham is legit.... a tad low brow IMO.)
Sorry - this whole thing makes me a little hot under th' rakusu...
What is the difference between enlightenment and schizoid personality disorder?
Zach, someone asked me once a long while ago about whether a certain Zen teacher (you guess who, I'm not telling) was legit or not. I told him that I honestly didn't know but that if he wondered about this he could simply ask that Zen teacher to produce his certificates or have his ordaining teacher write a letter vouching for it. I told him that's what I did once when such questions came up about me. When I saw a lot of stuff about that Zen teacher on the Internet I started wondering if I was the one who touched off the storm..
In fact, Genpo's paperwork is all very much in order. Which also says something about the issue of paperwork. It doesn't mean you're not a charlatan just because you have a certificate of authenticity.
."
Sigh...
Sadly, you are all too right about this. I am in the same lineage Genpo is, and to me personally, Genpo is doing EVERYTHING that my teacher warned to look out for... and is a charlatan. Even my teacher never came out publicly against Big Mind, but to his students he said the whole thing looked like a scam to make money...
Sorry if I came out strong.
I guess the authorities can only do so much - it's just frustrating.
As an aside, Barry Graham has booted folks who asked him about papers/proof...
I guess this is proof enough that he is a fraud.
Check this link from Zach.
Check the bottom two lines.
Tells you what Tricycle is good for.
What Dogen calls “stupid secular people” may not always be apparent.
Apparently.
It may be more important than the what's-his-name story in itself. (- Not that I understand why Brad won’t mention his name)
If a person fakes his credentials once it means he's a fake.
No true master would do that.
I can't really see why anyone would see such an essential need to go further.
If I buy into the notion of anatman (that there is no "self") - and I do - then "blaming the victim" makes no sense. I am the universe; the victim is the universe too; so I am to blame for others' suffering.
Even if I don't buy into it, it makes no sense. I mean, which is more likely: African kids starve because of negative consequences of karma from a previous life, or subsidies to US and European farmers made by people I elected make indigenous African farming prohibitively expensive causing repeated famines, all so that I can spend $4 on Cheerios and buy my third plasma-screen TV with the money I save?
But even if you don't accept that, the starving Africans cause you suffering as well because if they weren't suffering, they would be economically, socially, culturally, academically, intellectually and politically more active, contributing more to humanity generally. We all miss out because little Mbutu isn't eating today.
"I don't even care if this idea is objectively true or not. I believe it is or I wouldn't use it. But even if it turns out I'm wrong, this way of thinking has been so incredibly useful I still wouldn't give it up."
Fascinating.. It seems to me that you are saying that belief is more useful than the truth.

What a complete and utter load of bollocks. You could have "gotten to the bottom of it" in half the time it took it took me to read this post, much less the time you took to write it.
You refuse to use a name that you simply point to elsewhere on your blog - why? For what reason? Why the gamesmanship, obfuscation? Just say what you mean. Is it related to the picture of you embracing each other? You are already involved - own it.
Brad, you seem happy to accept your role as Zen authority when it suits you. You keep saying how you don't like to accept money for teaching Zen, and complain about others who do so, but you make your living essentially teaching Zen, in the guise of writing books - If you weren't a "Zen Master" no one would care, and you apparently wouldn't have any subject matter to write about.
Graham is symptomatic of exactly the shadow you and your work is casting. He's clearly modeled himself on you, as others are. You seem to have plenty of time to form opinions about all kinds of other pointless things. Own your impact in the milieu - I wish you weren't so prevalent, but unfortunately for us all, you are.
Kevin Souza seems to have made your work easy - go to his blog, spend the 15 minutes it takes to read all of its contents, and if you aren't convinced that BARRY GRAHAM is a complete fraud and pathological user then you shouldn't be teaching anyone anything, much less asserting yourself as an authority about Zen - which you unequivocally do, all your disclaimers notwithstanding.
What a cop out.

How much verification of his sleaziness do you need?
Why do you need Brad to denouce the pathetic dude's ass to be satisfied that the dude has been sufficiently denounced?
snessfir: I kid you not
There are always sociopaths and psychopaths who seek to use others, steal from them, abuse. The methods just change with the scenery, as new opportunities present themselves. Warner has largely crafted the parameters for this con job.
Do we leave victims to just figure out in what way they 'secretly desired' to be abused? Or do we speak out when we smell rat?
When the smoke around Graham grows so thick that potential victims have to virtually choke on it to get near him, then the American Zen community will have done its job. He is asserting himself as an authority in that community. He isn't. He's a two-bit con man and abuser.
This is not "he said/she said", or anything close to it.

You sound exasperated that Brad isn't doing what you'd do if you were Brad...Or that Brad isn't responding how Brad would respond if he were you.
Well...
The trouble with SBZA is that it gains most of it's authenticity from members who truly are working dharma or whatever... but like all organizations it will be infiltrated and corrupted by some and membership withheld as blackmail or used as a shield for evils. Such things are inevitable.
So one must be very careful whom they lend their trust and identity to because you will be judged by the company you keep - just like Aesop's farmer catching the stork in his field.

Brad has no problem slamming Genpo as a fake. But when it comes to someone like Barry Graham, he is not willing to even name him. One wonders why...
Master Svaha,
Perhaps Brad hasn't named whoever, this time, because he doesn't want to provide quotes that will very likely be used by this person's friends or enemies as fuel for yet another online spat - - for all the reasons stated in his post and in his subsequent comments.
But Brad seems to have no problem providing quotes that can be and has been used by Genpo's friends or enemies as fuel for online spats...
Yes indeed, Master S, but Brad feels rather differently about Genpo and...whoever.
Have you read the post and comments?
What post/comments?
Brad and Barry are lovers. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I'm just saying.
Not Lovers, butt buddies.
Funny, Graham claims to not believe in anything and Mysterion claims not to believe in anything. Butt buddies.
Karma=one of the 5 Niyamas or processes that move in the world.
There is no karma without intention. Unless Brad intended to get the shit kicked out of him, by taunting those guys or whatever, karma attached to him is irrelevant. It was not his "karma" to take an ass-whooping. Similarly with other "victims". The whole point, it seems, when Brad writes about the application of karma to himself is this. His intention.
Tsunamis, rape, abuse, fraud and so forth are not karma driven by those who are victim to these things.
There is no big scorekeeper in the sky keeping a list of who's naughty and nice.
Here's a big explanation about it. There are many if you google Buddhist Niyamas.
The Theory of Karma Basically Karma is not fatalism.
And if you don't like the Theravada explanation here's one from the Mahayana, specifically from a Zen guy.
Komment on Karma
Here's a list of the Niyamas for those too lazy to look it up.
Utu-niyama are the laws of physics, such as the weather and the changes brought about by heat and cold.
Bija-niyama are laws of heredity, which is best described in the adage, "as the seed, so the fruit."
Citta-niyama laws of psychology and cognition.
Kamma-niyama is law of cause and effect. [and it's not "personal" =anatta, nor is it the "law of attraction" or some other kind of bullshit like that]
Dhamma-niyama is the laws of the interdependence of all things, the way all things arise, exist and then cease.
Basic fucking Buddhism. Sheesh.
On the Barry Graham situation.
I've been writing about this for a couple of years as have a few others.
There's no reason Brad has to get on his high horse and go after the guy. He's got his own issues.
So what if Brad takes a stand and denounces him. Anyone actually think Graham cares about that? Brad, Joko Beck, John Tarrant, Kobutsu Malone, guys on death row and hundreds of others are only extras in the melodrama Graham's created and wallows in. He plays all these parts-big time international writer, Zen master, death row reporter and so on. Then invokes Ikkyu and/or some PTSD victim role when he gets called on it. He's got the angles sussed out.
Other than warning people, which Brad is rather tepidly doing, there is not much more that can be done unless someone files some charges. And I know that there are a few people who do have a viable legal case. This would likely include anyone who he performed a marriage ceremony for since he is not a recognized clergy person by any authorizing body. [that's called fraud Here is more on that specifically in reference to the Graham situation.]
I agree Nella, he doesn't have to go after the guy, but I don't agree with the comment of "having the bullshit detector on" or the "buyer beware".
Yes, we do have to be aware, and do our best to weed through the bullshit.
But. Brad's met Graham, and even believed that he was a Rinzai teacher. He mentions it. I believe they were even in communication for a bit.
So, where was Brad's "bullshit detector"? If he was a new student off the street, like myself, he could've just as easily been duped like the rest of us. Yes, this is speculation, but Graham is VERY convincing off the bat. He talks a great game. He hasn't made it this far by not.
Sometimes that detector just isn't sharp enough. The guys that are good at this, know what they're doing. It's dangerous.
Seriously said...
What is the difference between enlightenment and schizoid personality disorder?
9:29 AM
The enlightened one sees the disorder in himself, the unenlightened one doesn't.
Brad, thanks for your teaching. I think I know why I wanted that shitty thing to happen -) and I'm already acting with a new understanding.
Rich, If it was a simple as that, most all of us here would already see ourselves as enlightened.
Oh..
Most all of us here do see ourselves as enlightened.
First mumbles now ashiq chris this blog is taken over by black magic sufis!
Hey Kevin @11:32 I do recall when Graham was making remarks about being Brad's good buddy, dharma cousin or whatever. It was around the same time he was trying to get the dharma book published by Brad's old publisher. We don't hear anything about that book these days though. So who knows, maybe Brad, the publisher and other affiliated people got scammed by him too.
It's helpful to step back from these teachers and check out who actually publically supports them and who doesn't. I don't see many (other than Bernie Glassman) openly supporting Genpo for example. He just isn't mentioned by anyone or quoted, nor does his writing appear very often outside the Wilber/Cohen circle. But then again there is a whole underground set of connections in the Zen hierarchy. For example Big Mind is used at Jan Chosen Bay Roshi's very mainstream Great Vow Zen Monastery but you *never* see that advertised, mentioned on the website or in any ads. [it is mentioned in this video as a workshop topic at timecode 9:22]
So yeah the buyer not only has to beware but do some digging as well to find out what's really going on.
Jello Biafra once said that if you don't like a certain television show, turn the channel and if you don't like the Dead Kennedys then put on a different record. You dont need to eradicate the things you are uncomfortable with in the world.
If this Barry whoever is bothering you then dont go to him as a teacher. Simple as that. When you begin to round up a posse and demand that everyone be just as outraged as you are then you are the problem. Sooner or later those sort of witch hunts turn on themselves and everyone get a taste of burning at the stake.
Do the best YOU can in your life, spread the word if you must, but demanding that others to join in your crusade is where it gets scary. Please note that Brad never asked anyone to hate Genpopo, he put forth his view and facts and figured you would either be outraged or not, at the end of the day he didn't denounce anyone who decided not to agree with him.
I don't know who Barry is or anything about him, but if what he did is criminal then you should call the cops, if its merely morally reprehensible then don't patronize his services and spread the word in a reasonable way, more than that and you are causing harm, in my opinion.
Fake R @ 5:42 up here - I must've missed ashiq chris. Didn't read much.
R @ 7:49 am says: “I don’t believe you can’t apply it to others, and I have a good example of someone who did, successfully”.
There you are.
First real R then fake R then real R then fake R, these R's R taking over this blog!
Anon Bob @ 1:12 pm & Uku @ 1:27 pm: - What Brad is saying is not about Prajna. Brad kind of contradicts Sangai-yuishin and I’ve referred to this before but this is not the point.
Brad’s idea is that even though his thesis may be wrong he found out the subsequent line of thought proves practical. - So even if his initial assumptions are wrong this somehow works. Perhaps (theoretically*) due to other reasons he does not know. So he’d follow the line of action that proved useful even if he doesn’t really know why or how it works. Even in case he’s wrong, - he might find the real reasons later.
This is the rationale behind what he’s saying.
[* Cause Brad does not seem to always tell us the truth. See mine @ 8:36 am.]
And 6:36 is a fake.
What is a pirate's favorite letter?

Funny name, - Siegel.
Says who?
Brad says: "to me the Genpo Roshi stuff is far easier to pin down. I can see simply by watching one of his Big Mind® videos that he is a charlatan."
This is exactly how I feel about Graham. I've read his blog and watch the vid clips strewn about online, and all I can figure is that his accent is too seductive for Americans to handle. Scots are charming, no doubt. But the crap he says is almost invariably total bullshit.
And your opinion about Merzel is simply that - your opinion. It doesn't "pin down" anything. Graham on the other hand has a half-dozen women testifying that he suckered and abused them, a dozen former students saying he deceived and stole from then, the only Zen teachers he's had any proven contact with disavowing him and worse, and a long trail of proven deceptions, thievery, and lies IN PRINT. How you extrapolate that this is somehow less convincing than your exalted assessment of Merzel is beyond me.
So yeah, Brad, get your bullshit detector recalibrated, dude.
Kevin said: "So, where was Brad's "bullshit detector"? and, Sometimes that detector just isn't sharp enough. The guys that are good at this, know what they're doing. It's dangerous."
Despite his early nom de plume of Doubtboy, Brad has great faith and to his credit stands in polar opposition to dirtbags like Barry Graham even if he doesn't want to say so.
Brad said earlier, "I don't even care if this idea is objectively true or not. I believe it is or I wouldn't use it. But even if it turns out I'm wrong, this way of thinking has been so incredibly useful I still wouldn't give it up."
I think this is basic in Brad's philosophy and it doesn't seem much different from what the Baptists down the road believe. Put yourself in God's hands and get out of the way. What he wrote above seems to be a nice mental trick. But is it Buddhism?
One of the best reasons for going after people like Barry Graham was stated eloquently by Carl Sagan.
.
People seek out a teacher at first... well... because they can acknowledge that there is something they don't know... and are willing to disconnect the bullshit detector to give the benefit of the doubt to the person representing the "tradition"...
That is how people get hooked.
That is how "zen Master Rama's" start.
And most importantly, that is why teachers need to lead the charge against frauds and hucksters like Barry Graham.
I havn't read so much of the C so I am not sure how the following would come off, however...
What is a "zen" thing to do?
I mean is "zen" about "zen" or is it about the universe everybody lives in? Is it aimed at itself or is it aimed at everything? Are you seeking to master some weird unclear thing called "zen" or are seeking to master living in reality?

I didn't even post the last one. I posted another one and it was there, and I don't even think I clicked PYC and it posted the new one, and the old one is gone. It's worse than trolls.
Must be black magic, like you, or me or who? said earlier. Fucking sufis.
108 - you must not miss the 3rd link up on Brad’s post;
I think mumbles will like the book I linked @ 6:30 am; (not joking)
I linked the wrong song @ 7:00 am.
Why are you being so mean, Brad? We want you to agree with us and save us from ourselves. Is that so wrong? Isn't that what a zen saviour is supposed to do? We need your validation because we are not sure enough of ourselves to believe our own opinions. Please help! Quit "copping out"!
And there's another me up there too. [9:10 am]
Real diligent T.
Next is Zen.
Wow Old Bamboozles...
What a load of trolling crap.
Do you actually think folks are waiting with baited breath for Brad's holy words to "save us from ourselves"...??
The issue is that Barry Graham is a obvious fake.
Folks are just trying to understand why authentic teachers remain silent in regards to it...
Jesus, it is even obvious from the blog's responses that even IF Brad came out endorsing Barry Graham, that people would still not buy "Dogo's" bullshit.
If teachers can get together (as in the Aitken - Shimano letters) to call out another teacher on their bullshit, then why cant they come together to publicly decry outrageous frauds.
And my post is gone again.
It was there before “and”.
I’ll try again.
Zach, yours and others righteous indignation is pretty funny. Getting all worked into a lather like a bunch of tea partiers.
Who gives a shit about "authentic teachers" whatever that may or may not be? Like Brad says there are legit ones who will bamboozle you, and fake ones who will enlighten. WTF?
Grow ...
You know why I mention this chapter.
"Who gives a shit about "authentic teachers" whatever that may or may not be? Like Brad says there are legit ones who will bamboozle you, and fake ones who will enlighten. WTF?
Name a fake teacher who has enlightened anyone?
All you are saying is that there is no difference between real or fake, so who cares anyway... and THAT sir/ma'am, is a load of nonsense.
According to Red Pine (the amazing Bill Porter, if you haven't already, go now and read everything he's writ) Bodhidharma was indeed a real person, born in 440 in Kanchi, the capital of Pallava, a kingdom in southern India. In his book The Zen Teaching Of Bodhidharma, Red Pine has found by accident in Huang-Po's Essentials on the Transmission of the Mind a collection of sermons attributed to Bodhidharma. Here is an excerpt from the Bloodstream Sermon:
...And this real body is your mind. And this mind, through endless kalpas without beginning, has never varied. It has never lived or died, appeared or disappeared, increased or decreased. It is not pure or impure, good or evil, past or future. It. Its like space. You can't possess it and you can't lose it. Its movements can't be blocked by mountains, rivers, or rock walls. Its unstoppable powers penetrate the Mountain of Five Skandas and cross the River of Samsara. No karma can restrain this real body. But this mind is subtle and hard to see. Its not the same as the sensual mind. Everyone wants to see this mind, and those who move their hands and feet by its light are as many as the grains of sand along the Ganges but when you ask them, they can't explain it. They're like puppets. Its theirs to use. Why don't they see ...
- And if he’s a charlatan what about all the people he’s supposed to have transmitted. - Are they all charlatans as well? - Or has he fooled them into thinking they’ve been enlightened? - Or are they liars?
It doesn’t seem to make sense.
I don’t think you’ve ever referred to any of those questions.
And - … on the other hand - … I can’t really understand how could this person whom I understand even his name isn’t true have fooled you into thinking he’s a master, assuming you met him personally, and as I got it you spent a couple of days together.
Got it. FWIW.
Zach: Running after one teacher because he has "transmission" and rejecting another because he doesn't is hardly discrimination.
"Running after one teacher because he has "transmission" and rejecting another because he doesn't is hardly discrimination.
It IS discrimination.
HEALTHY discrimination.
I want to KNOW if my teacher at least is who he says he is!
If he is NOT, then it is healthy to discriminate.
A person who just sees this guy's picture together with Brad might see this as an affirmation that the guy is at least honest.
I'm not saying Brad should haunt him, (see pm’s @ 9:09 pm, perhaps others too) but I am saying he should make things clear for the record, especially since he's been engaged with him, it seems.
I can not really see why otherwise, though Brad might have his reasons.
Zach: Do you think Brad Warner is his "real name?" Thats his punk rock name like Jello Biafra.
FWIW I think Tattoozen at 5:58 AM said it best.
Change the channel if you don't like it. Exercise your free will that you claim this guy has control over.
Brad has already chickened out of fighting Genpo Roshi (Remember when Genpo used to post his challenges here on the blog?), and now this?
I'm losing respect for Warner.
*burns Hardcore Zen t-shirts*
I don't agree with changing the channel or turning our backs on what we see is wrong. It's not the same as not liking a band or a tv show. It's pretty much saying "hmm, that guy is pretending to be a zen teacher, and taking advantage of people? I'd rather not pay attention to that."
That's plain ignorance to me. But, yeah, you have the right to look away of you want. I'm just putting the facts out there. Something I, and alot of others wish there was a long time ago.
But you don't have to look.
Sour grapes.
You got too close and got your fingers burnt, now you can't move on.
Quit giving this guy your energy, he's still using you.
"After one of Genpo's students, Dan Hoen, started hanging out with Graham --- Graham denounced Brad in public several times -- I was present when he changed his whole position from "me and Brad are like that" to "Brad is a huckster". Barry went on to tell me Genpo was the finest Zen teacher he knew of and that he wanted to incorporate Big Mind at the Sitting Frog"
no, actually... I have moved on.... I've been practicing under another teacher for 2 years now, and haven't thought much about the guy until I started receiving emails from girls with their stories of abuse. To me, it's worth the energy spend what I have been. When it was just me and a few others, I didn't give a fuck. But when I heard the stories of what was actually going on, that's when I decided to speak up. I got my fingers burnt a long time ago. I've moved passed that. I was actually already gone and moved on before any of this started to surface in 2008. When I left Phoenix, I was still under the impression he was an ordained monk. I left for other personal reasons.
I'm just doing what I feel needs to be done. Take it for what it it's worth or change the website.
"Buddhism teaches that what we get in life is somehow something we wanted"."
This is want I think. Thanks for saving me the time to post it.
make that what not want
Brad: "Buddhism teaches that what we get in life is somehow something we wanted" (my bold)
NellaLou's post at 10:58pm above might help - -
"There is no karma without intention...The whole point, it seems, when Brad writes about the application of karma to himself is this. His intention."
I think that's what Brad's getting at too.
Happy Halloween!
That was a nice little documentry in the last post.
This current post reminds me of a book I read my freshmen year of college called On Course: Strategies for Creating Success in College and in Life by Skip Downing. I actually kept the book, because I found it inspiring and useful. There is a chapter that talks about how people that meet with difficult circumstances can either play the "victim role" or the "creator" role. Here's a quote "When people keep doing what they've been doing even when it doesn't work, they are acting as Victims. When people change their beliefs and behavoiros to create the best results they can, they are acting as Creators...When you accept personal responsibility, you believe that you create everthing in your life...Would it improve your life to believe that you create all of the joys and sorrows in your life? Answer 'Yes!' and see that belief imporve your life." Then the chapter goes on about the different attitudes of the Victim and Creator, but I'm not about to go through them all here. It's late and I need to go to bed.
So, Brad, your wanting to die or be dead caused some guys to beat you up with the intention to kill you?
Are they then not at fault?
"Buddhism teaches that what we get in life is somehow something we wanted"
Brad, may I inform you that your statement is misinformed. The Buddha taught that life in this world is characterized by eight kind of suffering:
1)Suffering of Birth
2)Suffering of Old Age
3)Suffering of Sickness
4)Suffering of Death
5)Suffering of being apart from the loved ones
6)Suffering of being together with people that one dislikes
7) Suffering of not getting what one wants
8)Suffering of the flouishing of the Five Skandhas.
Life is full of shit. We don't always get what we want.
So, Brad, your wanting to die or be dead caused some guys to beat you up with the intention to kill you?
Part 1 -
I'll take the liberty of editing some of what Brad wrote:
"I have often said that I believe whatever we get in this life is, at some level, something we wanted or needed. When I say this I am only applying it inwardly to myself...I often look at myself when I'm in a shitty situation and ask, "In what way did I want or need this shitty thing to happen?"
...when I apply this view to myself, my own suffering becomes much easier to bear. I remember...
...after the attack I thought to myself, "Buddhism teaches that what we get in life is somehow something we wanted, how does that apply here?"
When I began framing it this way to myself I felt like less of a helpless victim and more like a person who could do something active to improve his own life. And I did...For the first time in my life I stopped feeling like a victim of circumstance and really took control of my fate.
I don't even care if this idea is objectively true or not. I believe it is or I wouldn't use it. But even if it turns out I'm wrong, this way of thinking has been so incredibly useful I still wouldn't give it up."
Part 2 -
Seems to me Brad's saying that seeing yourself as a victim of random events can leave you confused, helpless and miserable. But understanding the Buddhist idea of the inter-connection of all things, including our own intentions, desires and actions, provides a model of how and why things happen "to us" that, by including our own 'wilful' behaviour, can give us a perspective in which the events of our lives are as much the result of what we intentionally did - as the result of what we've previously 'wanted' or 'needed' - as of what what others intentionally did - as the result of what they wanted or needed.
Why are we where we are in the first place? Solely as a result of 'circumstances beyond our control', or have our volitional/intentional actions (what we have 'wanted') play a part too?
I think Brad's saying that, looking at random, particularly unpleasant, events as being "somehow"/"at some level something we wanted or needed" has proved, for Brad, to be a useful and constructive approach - even if it's not an accurate/'true' model of how and why things happen (and what model is?).
Brad's not giving a lecture on the doctrine of Karma, but providing one example of how his understanding of the Buddhist idea of the role of (co-dependently-arising) volition/intention/desire/need/wants in what we usually see as 'things that happen to us' has enabled him to be happier.
That's how it reads to me, anyway.
Hey 108 - I thought you didn't believe in free will?
Don't start.
Interesting.
Here is a "LoL"...
Seems like Barry "Dogo" Graham bout his Kesa from Ebay.
He even gave the seller a review - and signed his name to it... *facepalm*
*bought* rather...
I have fat fingers this morning.:)
Of course, I’m sure Genpo and his butt-buddy Ken Wilber will end up on Oprah before then.
I can't speak for Brad, but:
My intentions aren't always readily apparent.
I have a penchant for crappy emotionally abusive relationships. If I'm not mindful (there's that dirty word again) of my actions, I'll choose to be around people who also like crappy emotionally-abusive relationships.
Why? Because I dig the rush of adrenaline from fighting and the rush of dopamine/endorphins/oxytocin that comes with make-up sex. Righteous anger followed by dirty/guilty/pissed-off poontang is... well, it's just tops. It's the bee's knees.
I also get something out of overbooking myself. Living my life in a never-ending crisis mode makes me feel... busy. And busy is important, so I must be important. It also means I'm a victim of being busy, so I always have a ready-made excuse if I fuck something up: not my fault, I have to rush.
Posting know-it-all comments on a stranger's blog, such as I'm doing right now, also provides cheap thrills. I can argue self-righteously because the bit of my brain that tones shit down for social cohesion gets turned off when the exchange is through an impersonal medium, such as the Internet.
My frontal lobe was designed by evolution to run permutations of future outcomes based on my previous experiences to figure out what I should do in the present moment. It's the miracle that has made humanity what it is, and it's about as good at predicting the future as a Magic Eight-Ball. It wildly overestimates benefits and underestimates costs, or vice versa: good for ensuring procreation and survival, not so good the rest of the time.
Especially because it runs on my previous experience. So if I've only ever been in emotionally-abusive relationships, I simply don't know there's another way to be in relationship with people.
That happens with everything. I always assume the way I do things is the best way to do things because I don't know it can be done another way.
I'm not a zen-genius, but isn't this that whole "Zen mind, beginner's mind" thing? A beginner actively recognizes he doesn't know and actively seeks to learn. The guy who's been doing it for years is stuck where he is because he doesn't realize there's more he could learn if he dropped his old ideas, assumptions, theories, hypotheses, paradigms and assorted mental crap?
So yeah: I dunno about you, but I certainly end up with crap I want, whether it's a conscious wanting or whether it's an unconscious one. Maybe y'all know better, but... because I'm a skeptic and a cynic and a bitter asshole ranting on the internet, I sincerely doubt you do.
Hi 108: Of course our actions play the big part in where and who we are. But what I find so interesting about Brad's scenario is his being able to adopt a fantasy and accept it as real in order to move through life a little more expediently. He doesn't care if it's true or not.
I sort of admire this because it is very practical and is based on Buddhist ideas and that makes it a little more palatable for me. But after everything is said and done, it is only a mental trick, just as crazy as believing that jesus has died on the cross to save us.
Well.. maybe not that crazy but still..
CAPTCHA : ohrici : I kid you not
Hi AB,
"(Interesting that Brad is)...able to adopt a fantasy and accept it as real in order to move through life a little more expediently. He doesn't care if it's true or not."
Brad did say, "I don't even care if this idea is objectively true or not. I believe it is or I wouldn't use it."
But you're right that he also said, "But even if it turns out I'm wrong, this way of thinking has been so incredibly useful I still wouldn't give it up."
- which does seem to contradict the first part. But he's just trying to be honest, I think, and when you do that, you often contradict yourself. I find.
I hear this part of Brad's post as confessional rather than didactic. None of us have to think how Brad does, or adopt the inconsistencies Brad confesses.
Didn't the Buddha say that his teachings are just a vehicle to get to the other side, and that once you get there it's about as useful to carry them around as it is to carry around a boat on dry land?
Karma, rebirth, the Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, the Precepts... they're just ideas to get us somewhere. If they work, great, use 'em. If they don't, find other, better ones.
Yes.. and like I said it is a rather graceful idea which I admire mostly. But it does take some mental adjustment to get there. At least for me it does.
If Genpo Roshi is really claiming ability to endow “Satori” within one hour, or even one day, or generally to whomever wishes, (which I do find hard to believe) see Mathew 20:20-23. “Ye know not what ye ask”.
The joke is heavy, but few will get.
And AC, - part of it becomes part of you, inherent, - no question of carrying it around or not carrying it around is left; - and as for - “If they don't, find other, better ones”, - the question is whether you can, and whether you can tell which ones are better.
- About the worst thing about humanity is that it can't see its own blindness. In my view. And the second is it won't admit wrongness even when it does see it. - Because tought otherwise.
And: - R @ 8:44, – [am] “Matthew”, - not “Mathew”.
Else is right.
ROFLMAO

If you were able to experience the totality of an entire lifetime as if it were one breath, then most of the details would seem quite minor. They all contribute to the big picture, but only in a supporting role.

Great Post by James Ford over at Monkey Mind
It's All in Your Head: A Meditation on Blaming the Victim as a Spiritual Practice
Here is another way to look at it.. if you are walking along the street and trip over a rock, fall down and bust your ass - do you blame the rock? Do you need to forgive the rock?
In reality, "forgiveness" is nothing more than the pacification of spurned entitlement.
Forgiving someone for killing your mother doesn't bring your mother back to life. All it does is pacify your sense of being entitled to respect and consideration from other people. If you had no expectations of people acting in a civilized manner, then you would not need to forgive them when they act like murderous animals. Yet people feel entitled to civilization. They feel they deserve it, that it is their right, as if it is a cosmic law of some sort. But if a shark bites a chunk out of your leg while you are swimming in the ocean, do you need to forgive the shark? The shark is just being a shark.
In this sense, everyone is like that rock in the road. You cant blame them for anything that happens to you, in the same way you cannot blame yourself for anything that happens to you. It is the process of life itself happening, and all the various ideas of "people" and "me" and "you" and "world" and so on just get in the way and make things infinitely more confused.
And when your entire life flows from the level of self image, there will be no end to the suffering it causes. It is ignorance begetting more ignorance, and pain magnetizing with itself. The entire idea of blame and forgiveness is a mirage caused by the self image.
So essentially, it DOES begin and end within you - regardless of how righteously indignant that perspective causes people to react. If you are too fragmented to remember the possible results of your chosen vector, you will never understand why the process exists in the first place.
The attitude and content of this post is exactly why I don't bother reading this blog much any more.
Even when I was more appreciative and a fan of Brad's, his take on what happened to him in Akron was something that bothered me. I find it rather along the lines of The Secret style magical thinking.
I do believe karma and intention play a role in much of what we experience. But not all, at least not in the sense implied by this. Even Buddha attested to this, as NellaLou points out. Some "karma" -- such as natural forces -- has nothing to do with our thoughts or intentions.
I don't think that expedient magical thinking has anything to do with Buddhism. I embrace Buddhism, Zen in particular, precisely because of its focus on truth. I prefer an uncomfortable truth to a comfortable lie.
It's scary to think that bad things can happen to us for no moral reason. It's disempowering, definitely. It ruins our overwhelming desire to believe in a "just world." But that doesn't mean it's not the way things are.
More and more, I find the study of evolution, science, and natural history to go hand in hand with my Buddhist practice and inquiry. And the more I learn about science, the more I appreciate that a mystical or spiritual perspective can grow out of it. And if you "believe" in evolution, as opposed to some form of creationism, you accept that chance and probability play major roles in the development of life. That is not to say life itself is random--the way I think of it spiritually is that what we are was "programmed" or "coded" into the universe from the beginning--but that what particular events lead to it are.
The way I get around the dilemma that Brad poses--of not letting an experience of victimization become demoralizing--is not to resort to magical thinking. It's to look at what I can do to improve my situation and reduce the odds of experiencing whatever it was. Much of the time, I find I played a major role in the series of events leading up to the problematic event. But not always. Sometimes you have an auto accident because you were driving while sleep deprived; sometimes you have an auto accident because a deer happens to randomly jump out in front of your car. I think the problem is looking at an event like the latter and trying to tie it to something one was responsible for. The Secret and the "Law of Attraction" encourage this kind of confused thinking, and Brad seems to do so too. But all the positive thoughts in the world aren't going to affect whether it's your car the deer jumps in front of.
Brad calling upon this attitude to justify his lack of interest in the Barry Graham situation is something I find hypocritical, but this is in keeping with what I've come to expect from Brad. I find it a symptom of cowardice. In many ways, Genpo is an easier target. There's no real backlash for attacking him. Brad opening up a line of criticism against Barry Graham would open him up to a lot more things than Brad's criticizing of Genpo.
To me, that is the only reason. If Brad is so blase about people needing to be responsible for their own choices and research when assessing Zen teachers, he wouldn't continually return to his quixotic crusade against Genpo, which he repeatedly attributes to his felt duty to protect people from spiritual abuse like he experienced in the past.
There's something very nearly silly about the whole Genpo issue. When I saw Genpo's audition video for Oprah, I laughed. Yes, Genpo offers up some blatant spiritual materialism, but at worst he's going to waste some folks' time and money. The Graham issue opens up a lot of darker and more unsettling things to examine, and the consequences are potentially uglier. Genpo is just a Daruma doll Brad can knock down again and again to "energize his base." I find it all self-serving, part of the industry of "self promotion above all" that Brad has developed around himself.
Stephanie:
You're playing a zero-sum game which I don't think Brad or anyone else is advocating. It's not like "Either you're 100% to blame or you're not." But I do think that everybody plays some part in the stuff that happens to 'em. A deer can't jump out in front of my car if I don't drive down that road, I don't drive in the countryside, I don't drive...
... the point is to take ownership for your part of what happens to you. A deer jumps out in front of my car - I can't control the deer, but I can drive slower and I can recognize that driving a car entails some degree of risk. If I don't want to run the risk of hitting a deer, I shouldn't drive a car down that road.
The problem is that people want all the benefit and none of the drawback. I believe this is known in Buddhism as the "Second Noble Truth." And people being people are absolutely brilliant at deluding themselves into thinking they can have it.
And: it takes 2 to tango. You can't have a psychotic ex-girlfriend or -boyfriend unless you (at some point) attracted to you, were attracted to, and chose to date, a crazy person. I could be way off the mark, but I think Brad's saying that the same is true of spiritual teachers. If he isn't, I'm saying it. You don't drink the Kool-Aid unless you abdicated responsibility a long time ago.
There's plenty of literature on this subject: "The Guru Papers" by Kramer and Alstad, "Do I Need a Guru?" by Mariana Caplan... what's funny is that us "spiritual" types think we're somehow evolved while ordinary folks seem to avoid these poisonous relationships without even trying.
Ashiq,
Yes, you could avoid ever hitting a deer by never driving a car through a rural area. I don't think that makes a person "responsible" for the random event of a deer jumping in front of his or her car. By your logic, the way to avoid ever tripping and falling is to never walk, the way to avoid ever getting sick is to live in a plastic bubble. There is no practical application of your point of view, because the only way to completely avoid the chance of negative outcomes of random or probabilistic events is to never do anything.
And I find it a morally repulsive view when it comes to victims of random, or even non-random, violence. To me, the much more sane way of addressing these issues is to treat them as social issues and proceed accordingly, not shrug off with a "thugs will be thugs, it is our responsibility to find a way to avoid them" philosophy. I think it is our general human duty to make our communities safer, and much moreso for those of us who have made the bodhisattva vow. I do not believe a bodhisattva with a clear view would take a neutral stance against a victimizer, while imploring the victim to consider his or her role in the attack. Yes, part of the response is to help the victim make choices so as to not find him or herself in harm's way again, but the brunt of the responsibility lies in the attacker's actions. In my view, a sane, moral person focuses on the attacker as the focal point of necessary action, not the victim. Otherwise, we encourage and promote a culture in which thugs have the control and the power, while potential victims must stay in their foxholes. An intolerable situation, and one that seems insane to most normal people, thankfully.
As far as the Barry and Genpo issue goes, I'm far from advocating for Brad to start a PR campaign against Barry. I don't think Brad has anything useful to contribute to that collective action. I'm pointing out the total hypocrisy and inconsistency, however, in his defense of his crusade against Genpo in order to protect all the potential victims of Genpo's "scam," while shrugging off a teacher accused of far worse as a "buyer beware" situation and inviting victims of violence to look at their victimization as, at least in part, their responsibility.
Brad's stance is completely logically and morally inconsistent. If Brad were to be consistent, he would carry his apathetic attitude toward social and political issues, and most spiritual Zen issues, through into his approach to Genpo. But if Brad didn't have Genpo to rail against, a convenient, easy, and non-threatening target, he would lose a big part of what makes up the "Brad Warner" brand, which I increasingly see as a shiny, empty package filled only with air.
Hi Stephanie,
I don't hear Brad advocating a method for apportioning moral responsibility. I hear Brad posing a question in response to a comment on this blog: Once an unpleasant event has occurred, how then do we deal with it? As victims, or as contributing participants? Which approach is more likely to result in a view which can be employed to constructively modify our behaviour? Brad answered the question by describing an approach that works for him.
From his post:
." (my bold).
Could Brad have made it any clearer that he's writing about a way of thinking that he's found useful, NOT providing an analysis of the way the world works that should be applied to others, or that others should adopt?
Re Genpo - Brad don't like what Genpo gets up to one bit. Re the other fella - Brad, it seems, isn't that bothered whether the guy has a transmission certificate or not (he may still be a good teacher), or whether he's lied about it (the cat's out of the bag). Brad knows no details about any abuse of students that may have taken place, so reserves judgement. He also says there's not much he could do about it that isn't already being done. So Brad doesn't care that much. And you're saying he should; lately you're thinking Brad is an inconsistent, self-promoting hypocrite...
You may see Brad's objections to what Genpo gets up to as evidence of a general 'commitment to social and political issues' which should extend to the issues surrounding the other fella, but, clearly, Brad doesn't. Why should Brad's objections to selling/advocating enlightenment glimpses/experiences commit him to adopting positions on sundry issues? Merely because in both cases a teacher of Zen is involved?
We care about what we care about, we do what we do, and we deal with things the way we deal with them. We don’t have to like what other people say, do or write, or the way they deal with things, but while you're perfectly entitled to object to what you see as contradictions, much of what you’ve criticised about this post wasn’t written or meant. Not as I read it.
Malcolm it's the only completely uncensored Zen Buddhist forum I know of and because I like writing; I like the sound of my own voice. At least, I'm trying to find my own voice. This blog is crazy and infuriating. It's also an education and an entertainment. Mainly an entertainment...on a good day. Some of the other people who post here make comments I can engage with and relate to. Some of them are pretty funny too. I'm sympathetic and supportive of where Brad's coming from and what he's trying to do, and so I sometimes rush to defend him when I think he's been misunderstood or misrepresented.
Still, I sometimes muse that Brad's celebrity may not be an entirely positive factor in his life - but Brad's life is not my business. Brad owes me nothing and I don't owe him. I do think he tries to be honest though, and for me, that's more important than always being consistent or right.
Moral outrage comes in many forms, and like any other human expression it has countless subtle shades.
At the core of moral outrage is the sense of entitlement accorded by the idea of a superior self, as in: a self that is better than others, more important, more valuable, etc. This reality might be hard to accept, when one realizes their entire life is based on a lie. Or it might be liberating.
But as long as one is unable or unwilling to examine the root causes of their own mind and its workings, they will do nothing but wander amongst the details, poking and prodding and isolating and magnifying.
The insidious nature of the divisive illusion is all-encompassing. It is the idea that "me" is separate from "you" or the "world" and so on. The objectification of such abstraction is usually the most "real" aspect of a persons life. Without it, they are reduced to little more than a vegetative state. The vastness of universal connectivity actually stupefies them. This blank space can come alive, or it can remain ignored - but in the great majority of the population it remains ignored, willfully.
So its quite understandable why confusion happens and why it continues to happen. People are lost among the endless objects, as just another one of them.
You do not own your body. Its just a temporary loan. Wake up to the reality behind "me", "my", "mine" if you can. If not, then go ahead and enjoy the war.
Stephanie:
I am a victim: I have a brain disease. I didn't want it, didn't do anything to get it, wish I didn't have, have suffered (greatly) because of it.
I am also a victimizer: because my brain controls my behavior, and my disease affects my brain, my disease affects my behavior. And in this case, I hurt other people with my actions - my parents have been hurt by my actions, my ex-fiancee was hurt by my actions, my dog is now dead because of my actions.
Or: criminals. In this country, they're overwhelmingly poor, black or Hispanic, under- or uneducated, jobless, ghettoized: victims of our failures as a society. And yet - they commit crimes. Often against each other. Often violent crimes. Often violent sexual crimes for that matter. Which are they: victim or victimizer?
I'm not Brad, so I'll speak for myself: I think that a bodhisattva counsels both victim and victimizer on their respective responsibility for the suffering they cause and the suffering they suffer so that each can do something about it.
The reason a bodhisattva talks to a victim is that a victim can often lessen their suffering by (at least) seeing if they play a part in it. In my case, I'm responsible for treating my brain disease - to lessen my own suffering, as well as that of others.
As for Brad talking smack about Genpo but not about Barry, well... since I've never been inconsistent or hypocritical in my life, I think I'm morally pure enough to cast the first stone, so hand it here...
PS and for the record -
I wrote "...Which approach is more likely to result in a view which can be employed to constructively modify our behaviour?" ?
What a crock. I doubt whether anyone can employ a view to constructively modify behaviour.
Whadya think, Steph?
"The reason a bodhisattva talks to a victim is that a victim can often lessen their suffering by (at least) seeing if they play a part in it."
There is some truth to this. Where it often goes off the rails is when there is some kind of presupposition of omniscience or fortune telling, meaning "They should have seen it coming" kind of thinking. That just doesn't happen. Not everyone has the same life experiences from which to draw conclusions nor to be able to predict another's or random behavior from the environment. Human beings just aren't that powerful though we like to think we are often.
So taking responsibility from a victims point of view is rather constrained by whatever available information is at hand. To hold someone responsible for something they could not have possibly known is quite ridiculous.
I may be beating a dead horse here, but that mindset "in what way did I want or need this" is very existentialist in nature. In my own mind, existentialism and Buddhism are practically synonymous. I guess this is my chance to ask if I am that far off. Am I?
To understand that Karma exists and that we each reap the fruits of our past actions has nothing to do with Blame. Blame as an act of attributing fault; censure; reproof: Saying there should be no compassion because you have judged that a victim “deserved” what has happened to them is simply another set of delusions that need to be overcome. Leave such value judgments to the theists who see ones fate as punishment or reward by some all powerful judging God. You may be experiencing the fruits of prior actions, it may be your Karma, But Buddhism dose not attach value judgments to this, it is not the Buddhist concept that those who are experiencing karma “deserve” this or that, Karma is not punishment or reward. It is simply cause and effect.
To have the clarity of mind to diagnose your own thoughts and behavior to avoid mistakes of the past is another subject completely. If in doing this you begin to lose sight of your goal and start “blaming and judging” you will have missed the mark completely.
The first Zen Buddhism lectures in the US, as far as I know were given by Soyen Shaku in 1905 and published in 1906, the translation being done by D.T. Suzuki. Shaku was and still is often attacked for his support of Japanese military expansion during the Russo–Japanese War of 1905. It seems that making subjective evaluations of teachers who don’t fit into our mental expectations traveled with Shaku when he came here and it seems to never stop.
I had never heard of Dogo Barry Graham until I inadvertently ran across a blog dedicated to his utter destruction the other day. The blog started out by accusing him of wearing a terrible colored Rakusu, then accused him of putting his chop on several Rakusu’s crooked, and leaving a line off of a Kanji. But my Favorite was the 3 paragraph forensic analysis of some letters from a couple of his teachers that the author concluded must be fake because they were done on a laser printer, and laser printers were not commonly available in 1994. I had to laugh my ass off here because I purchased my first HP 4L laser printer in 1991, and by 1994 they were the professional standard and you could pick up at least 5 different models at office depot. This Guy Dogo might be a total ass, but these attacks I read are just malicious BS.
Like Brad I have to say the Genpo Roshi stuff is so glaring it almost blinded me when I first saw it. PT Barnum said there was a sucker born every minute and I suppose he was right. The world is full of victims and it is certain many are both willing and enthusiastic in their search to be victims. People like Sogyal Rinpoche and Genpo should be exposed but what anyone person can do, even the mighty Brad Warner is very limited.
I agree with Brad that The Soto Zen Buddhist Association’s (SZBA) effort to weed out the fakes is doomed to failure. Already this effort has turned into an exercise in wall building. They who never had to do half of the things they want to require of others sit smugly sealing up the door so they are the new dictators of Zen. Many crooks and charlatans love complex credentialing, the more paper they can hang on their walls the better.
The simple fact is I could make a wonderful case against almost any teacher now teaching and question their linage, their teacher’s qualities of character and their spiritual fitness to teach. This Brad Warner guy lets rip him apart, hell how many Ango had he lead when he was ordained, etc. etc. Organized Zen is about 50 years old in the US; all this stupidity may kill it before it has had a chance to really grow.
When up is up and down is down and down is up and up is down - I cannot be found.
WAKE THE HELL UP!!!!

LES KAYE’S LETTER IS UNBELIEVABLY IRRESPONSIBLE
No one commits suicide for a single reason. No one. Never.
In my book Zen Wrapped in Karma Dipped in Chocolate I wrote about my friend Robert “Iggy” Morningstar committing suicide. Iggy’s girlfriend had just broken up with him. She did it as much for Iggy’s good as for her own. I was sharing a place with them at the time and she was absolutely justified in what she did. Iggy was making a mess of his life and hers as well.
When Iggy killed himself he did the deed in such a way as to ensure that his girlfriend would be the one who found him and that it would appear as though he killed himself because she broke up with him. In the weeks that followed those of us who were around Iggy’s girlfriend had to constantly assure her that she bore no guilt in the matter. Perhaps the break up was a factor in Iggy’s suicide. But it was not the only factor or even the decisive one.
On February 14th, 2011, Dosho Port put a letter written by Les Kaye of the American Zen Teachers Association (AZTA) to the board of directors at Kanzeon, Genpo Roshi’s temple, on his blog. You can find that post here. This same letter from Les Kaye also appears here on the Sweeping Zen website.
Les Kaye’s letter was written in response to accusations by some people at Kanzeon that AZTA had failed to respond when they knew that Genpo Roshi was having sex with his students and misappropriating funds. Les Kaye points out in the letter that AZTA had been trying to get Genpo’s authorization to teach Zen revoked at least since 1992.
I understand Les Kaye’s desire to clear AZTA’s good name. But one section of his letter strikes me as perhaps the most irresponsible thing I’ve seen come out of this whole mess. It makes me very angry to see this.
In his letter, Les Kaye reveals the story of a woman who was allegedly seduced by Genpo Roshi. Kaye says that she “had been abused by her father as a child, which left her extremely vulnerable and confused.”.”
Although he uses the proper somber, sepia colored tones of heartrending melodrama approved by contemporary American Buddhists, Mr. Kaye appears to me to be accusing Genpo Roshi of causing this poor woman to kill herself. Please see the opening two paragraphs of this article for my opinion on that. I know that the effect of what Mr. Kaye wrote is to make people think that Genpo’s sexual behavior caused a suicide because that is precisely how it was defined to me by two people who emailed me about these articles.
I don’t like Genpo Roshi. I’ve made no attempt to hide that fact. But accusing him of causing someone to commit suicide is taking things much too far. We do not know what really transpired between Genpo and that unfortunate woman. I’m going to say that again and I’m going to be a little firmer this time. You -- and I mean you dear reader, whoever you are -- do not know what happened between Genpo and that unfortunate woman. If Genpo is reading this (which I doubt) maybe he has some clue. But even he doesn’t know all of it. The rest of us only know what we’ve read about it. And that is not very much.*
Am I trying to say that it’s fine that Genpo seduced some poor woman who’d been abused by her father? No. No, I am not saying that. No. OK? Not at all. No.
I’m saying that we do not even know that’s what really happened. Maybe it did. Maybe it didn’t. We don’t even know what that woman actually said at the meeting. All we have is someone’s paraphrase of what he thought he heard her say 18 years ago.
Which is also not to say it did not happen or that I don’t believe what she said. I don’t know what she said. So I cannot either believe or disbelieve it. But I do know what Les Kaye said because it’s there on the Internets for all to see.
There is no reason to add this to the piles of accusations that have already been hurled at Genpo. Believe me, I am not someone who would easily stand up in Genpo Roshi’s defense. But this is too much to ignore.
Why is it all about sex? Why do we have to wait until Genpo is caught with his pants down and his dick where it shouldn’t be before we can say anything about the much more serious and far-reaching abuses he was involved in?. The hidden details of Genpo’s sex life had nothing at all to do with any of that.
The things that Genpo was doing that made me so pissed off were not concealed in any way. They were right out in the open. He explicitly advertised that he was selling enlightenment experiences for $50,000**. He clearly said in his promotion material for Big Mind® that it could give you a glimpse of Buddha’s realization in a couple of hours with no prior experience. This was no shocking revelation discovered by someone finding secret messages on Genpo’s Blackberry. This was stuff you could see for yourself by looking at Genpo’s own website. Where was everyone’s righteous indignation three years ago?
The AZTA has written a letter to Kanzeon, Genpo's group, recommending what they think Genpo ought to do to cure his sex problem. You can see that here just under Les Kaye’s letter, at the bottom of the page. My friend Zuiko, one of the signees, told me the letter.” OK. I accept that Zuiko contributed to the letter in this spirit. To me it all sounds a bit sanctimonious.
Hey Genpo, here are my recommendations, which stand just as much chance of being read and followed by you as AZTA’s. I have a lot of trouble with phrases like “sex addiction.” Though there may be a few cases that could qualify as true addiction, I believe that for the most part it’s just that some people are simply hornier than others. When an individual has a different sexual orientation from mainstream society, there are two main ways to deal with it. The individual can adjust to mainstream society, usually with unhappy results for the individual. Or the individual can seek out others who share their orientation and they can play together. (There is, of course, also the traditional religious response of learning to deny your sexual desires entirely. But few people are able to accomplish this. And sometimes when they fail at denying their desires the outcome is even worse than if they had not tried at all.)
Luckily for you, you live in the Western world in the early 21st century where the option of seeking like-minded play friends is available to you. It is far easier than it ever has been for so-called “sex addicts” to find each other. You don’t need to do your students.. Fortunately for you that particular kink is very widespread and common.
(You learn a few things when researching a book about sex!)
*It was subsequently revealed by a friend of the woman in question that her suicide occurred quite a long time after the meeting and was probably completely unrelated to what transpired with Genpo.
**The fee for Genpo's Big Heart Circle retreats subsequently dropped to $25,000 and these days it’s hard to find any of the material he originally posted about these high priced retreats. Here is a blog which quotes most of Genpo’s now-vanished sales pitch for the Big Heart Circle retreats. The standard price for Big Mind® appears to range between $150 and $1000.

Jesus Brad. Do you really know what you're talking about? I suppose the numbers of people with gambling problems are overstated too. Mostly just people with losing problems right? Alcoholics? People with no will power or self control. And we all know about the type of women who get raped..

I don't have as big a problem with Kaye stating the facts in the chain of events. People can draw conclusions or do as you did and not. You are not the only critical adult reading this stuff. Is the suicide supposed to be hushed up in Zen circles? It facts sound bad because they were bad.
Hi,
I understand that White Plum, which is a loose confederation of teachers associated with Maezumi Roshi, is taking actions on its own. I am not sure who is involved or the details however.
Gassho, Jundo
“No one commits suicide for a single reason. No one. Never.”
Yes and no.
There are multiple events/reasons in a person's life that take them to the point of suicide. However, there is only one successful suicide per person, so there is usually only one trigger event.
Hi,
Here's a website where you can learn about ASIST suicide intervention trianing. The widepsread training days/workshops are usually free or come at low cost (over in these parts at least) and are very useful and insightful for anyone effected by suicide, or for anyone who works with people or who is just interested.
In the US:
In the UK:
In Ireland:
ASIST trains participants to reduce the immediate risk of a suicide and increase the support for a person at risk..

Drunkenness is temporary suicide..
- “No one commits suicide for a single reason. No one. Never.”.
- What kind of bullshit is that?
See SS, B. 1, no. 1.
merciless, there is some interesting literature available regarding addiction which pits forward the idea that what is commonly called addiction is actually poor choices. Individuals are not powerless to change such behaviour, and labelling such choices as addictions in fact perpetuates this behaviour.
This is rather controversial amongst the majority of clinicians working in the field.

"[Bertrand] Russell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in sex, religion and mathematics, and that only the wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.

Sorry: Brad's being metaphysical. It's a Zen teaching on causation.
With a bit of Googling I was able to find this, too.
It gets deleted down here so I put it up at the “name”.
(That’s why I got mistreated by Google in the first place)
- “All of these AZTA people are getting upset about absolutely the wrong things. They should have been publicly stating that Big Mind® was not Zen Buddhism years ago.”.
Than why? This is one point I’ve been wondering about Brad gives no explanation to.
- “He explicitly advertised that he was selling enlightenment experiences for $50,000. He clearly said in his promotion material for Big Mind® that it could give you a glimpse of Buddha’s realization in a couple of hours with no prior experience.”.
This seems like a bit of a withdrawal. See bolding.
- “Why do we have to wait until Genpo is caught with his pants down and his dick where it shouldn’t be before we can say anything about the much more serious and far-reaching abuses he was involved in?”.
- Again - my point from 10:27 - [am] if Brad is right about this - why is he the only one shouting about.”.
Read the letter and see if this is what is sounds like.
Just in case anyone imagines M @ 10:46 is relevant to mine @ 10:41: - The question was how much sense does Brad's quote I quoted @ 10:03 make.
Taking a break from the comments eh? Sure you are...
mine @ 10:21
- “I believe that for the most part it’s just that some people are simply hornier than others”.
I loved that. But hated what follows.
- B’s idea, - is that whatever your inclinations or tendencies are, - you can never change or improve them, no matter where you get, - in any field whatsoever.
Not only zazen is good for nothing, - but any other practice you might think of.
- And to (108 the) merciless @ 9:34: - [am] Remember we’ve heard of alcoholism since before either one of us was born, - I suppose. - Same might go for hopeless gamblers I guess. - But “sex addiction” seems to be a new phrase we only seem to encounter in the last decade or two. Sounds to me like a new idea of the typical conceited intellectuals. - I don’t know much about the subject but I’m quite with Brad on this point.
+ - [back to Brad] Brad seems to assume that since humanity has not been able to hold stable and continuous standards as for appropriate or inappropriate sexual behavior, - such may not be found in existence.
[Or to pretend to assume that.] (- I’m a real trouble maker, - am I not?)
- It is quite like assuming since many do not know the Buddha Dharma it does not exist.
Not just the same but I guess you can grasp the similarity.
- It is true some things may change due to development in humanity, - but mainly this is claiming the subtle to be nonexistent for the sake of popularity.
May be fine for anyone who can truly enjoy 0DFx.
OK. So this is what I'm reading
1. Implication of responsibility in suicide is wrong
2. The emphasis on sexual misconduct is missing the point
3. The point is that packaging instant-enlightenment as Zen commodity is wrong
a) Because instant-enlightenment is not a Zen perspective
b) Because misleading people to believe this is true can be harmful to them
What might help would be to speak more to point 3a) Why is instant-enlightenment wrong view? What is right view? and 3b) How is holding wrong view harmful?
That might help your readers to make a more informed decision that avoids confusion about correct principles due to confusion about personality.
Suggestion for increased effectiveness in message: Separate the principles from the personality to make your point more clearly understood to more people..
The society of traditional Japan was long held to be a good example of one in which shame is the primary agent of social control.
I can see why Brad thinks that the idea of sex-addiction is just new-speak for mega-horniness but I'm not so sure he's right.. If you believe that a person can become psychologically dependent on certain behaviors and I think there is evidence for that, then I think that it is possible for someone to become addicted to certain experiences that release certain neurohormones. The only question would be; are you addicted to the experience or the rush of the neurohormones? Or is it the same thing?
two aspects of the same process?
For decades, endorphins have hogged the credit for producing “runner’s high,” that fleeting sense of euphoria and calm that many people report experiencing after prolonged exercise. Who among usI, after an especially satisfying workout, hasn’t thought, “ah, my endorphins are kicking in.” Endorphins are the world’s sole celebrity peptide....

Brad,
Can one be addicted to celibacy?
...about 'sex addiction' :
"Though there may be a few cases that could qualify as true addiction, I believe that for the most part it’s just that some people are simply hornier than others."
Whoa whoa whoa, hold on. I think everyone is focusing on the wrong thing here.

Which websites are you talking about here?
If sex were simply sexual Brad's post reads ok
But sex is a many nuanced and complicated behavior between persons
Depending on what kind of circumstances were present during one's first sexual arousal and release states you can get some strange imprinting which factors in to your behaviors
I am glad for 12 step programs sex and love addicts anonymous--of tremendous benefit--
I do not think it is possible to judge others sexual dispositions
Sometimes it is not possible to clearly know who the victim or who the perpetrator is
Humans have quite the ability to see the same things with exact opposite interpretations
I can't judge other people's sexual involvements.
Only my own
I might not fully know my patner's intentions...I might find out later.
I am in a position to know my own intentions.
If I had a more active libido I'd be living a different life
I think it would make me more popular, but who knows
I do think it is important to take responsibility for one's actions particularly when cobbling together different life styles where sexual intimacy is concerned.
Couples decide for themselves what works for them
Sometimes finding out what that is includes collateral damage, namely other people and other people's relationships
The mental image of a zen teacher (or catholic priest, or CEO of a company for that matter) sitting in a zendo, officiating mass in church, sitting in a board room with multiple persons with whom they have had sexual relations with present strikes me as strikingly odd and icky
A bit too akin to familiar incest if you ask me
-------
There is help out there
"A bit too akin to familiar incest if you ask me"
do you mean "child molestation" or did you really mean incest? The difference is that Incest, while icky and weird, is between consenting parties while child molestation is between a party that has not or can not give consent.
Its an important difference. If both people are grown ups then they bear the right to take whatever decisions they choose, and to deal with the consequences.
its a little scary to me that people make the argument that just because one person wears a funny robe and has a title that the other person in a relationship should be treated like a child.
Is what you are doing "Zen Buddhism" Brad?
Me thinks Brad doth protest too much...
It seems obvious that Brad simply wants to propagate the Genpo scandal IN FULL by repeating what Les wrote, and his denial of agreement with it is simply subterfuge.
I for one would not have seen it (Les's statement), or sought it out otherwise.
We need that guy who kept obsessing on Brad's penis length to come back here and offer us some perspective on this mess.
Brad,
Can one be addicted to zazen? I'm serious. It doesn't do anything, but people have these subconscious hopes.
Forgive them for they know not what they do.
Brad-
Beautiful post. I mean the part about Merzel's not being responsible for the woman's suicide. Dead on there. The other stuff I largely agree to the point of I guess it don't need sayin'. But I guess to you it does.
To me, "Big Mind®" was a scam from the get-go. I think I get it for maybe different ways then you get it, but we both get it.
But, as I wrote on my blog, the sex thing reveals something. And at the same time, neither you nor I can barely imagine the crap Genpo is going through these days - unless he's a friggin' psychopathic narcissist, which is not out of the question. But imagining this guy is one of us - I can't imagine the hurt I would be going through at this moment.
Also - make no mistake: folks in Genpo's sangha read your blog; they read my blog. So it's more than likely Genpo reads your blog.
I appreciate your passion on this; maybe I'll even send this comment in an e-mail to you.

"Brad,
Can one be addicted to zazen? I'm serious. It doesn't do anything, but people have these subconscious hopes."
Brad is distancing himself from the comments section.
I would say it is possible to become addicted to ANYTHING - providing you have a compulsive-addictive personality disorder. Now a few things - nicotine being one - are so addicting that even people with moderate to light CAPD can become enslaved to nicotine.
It's not quite like genetic OCD.
As for Genpo and Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD)???
Who knows? Certainly not I.

LOL. What is "Zen Buddhism"? Ask 10 Zen teachers and you'll get 17 answers. Big Mind is no more or less "Zen Buddhism" than anything else anyone claims it to be. Despite the entire lineage nonsense, Zen teachers are really just making all this up as they go along, and have been ever since Hui-neng came along (assuming he ever existed). Steven Heine wrote a book about it: "Zen Skin, Zen Marrow: Will the Real Zen Buddhism Please Stand Up?"
And now this:
"Response to an Open Letter from 44 Zen Teachers."

Perhaps where Genpo was remiss was in his apparent boundary violations - perhaps taking that which was the sangha's as his own. Those boundary violations included, but were not limited to allegedly exploiting his students emotionally, financially, and sexually.
My take is that this is probably where Brad wanted to, albeit not clear enough. it is not the sex in itself which is "sinful", it is the being oblivious of the harm done unto others. If you are a buddhist teacher, your responsibility is greater just because you are a teacher.
No one on earth is free to do harm onto others, buddhist or not. And who does will bear the consequences of it, with fortune if they can get them in a way clearly related to their deeds,.
It sure sounds like the Kanzeon folks are doing there best. It is also true that they are probably best qualified to deal with there own problem. There must be a bit of embarassment as well because this sounds like a problem that they were ok with not dealing with it when it was benefiting them financially.
It is a free country and people obviously get into talking about all this controversy because it is scanadoulous and sexy and an easy topic to feel help people feel better about themselves, or more moral, "I would never do such a thing", that kind of stuff. I just wonder if that's the best theme for the Hardcorezen Blog. I know these are all very recent developements and people are gonna talk about whats going on, but I hope it this blog doesn't become the TMZ of the Zen community.
I know i have been criticcal of people who are on Brads case for not writting the right things or not being enlightened enough of what not, but yeah i have never been a fan of soap opera drama, weather fictional or real, and i just kinda hope this all starts to fade away soon. Sounds like things have been aired out and people are informed. Everybody kinda said there piece.

I didn't even realize that Mr. Merzel was selling more than one "product" so let me make sure that I understand how this process works. First you buy a "Big Mind" and then you buy a "Big Heart"? Is there something "big" that comes after that? Maybe "The Big Lebowski"? That would be pretty cool, but only if Jeff Bridges was the instructor.
Yeah, that's what Genpo got in trouble for: using his Big Lebowski.
"When Iggy killed himself he did the deed in such a way as to ensure that his girlfriend would be the one who found him and that it would appear as though he killed himself because she broke up with him."
Suicides are as much about causing suffering as they are about ending suffering.
FORE!
First of all only the person afflicted decides whether or not he/she is an addict. No one else. Hence only the person afflicted decides if their behaviour can be classified as addiction.
Man oh man, the buddhist community is seriously dysfunctional! Gossip, back stabbing, name calling, sheesh... who knew?

My reply to Moonface:
Fuck 'experience'. Experiences can be misleading.
The despire to repeat certain kinds of experiences is called addiction.
Experiences can be manipulated
Experience can be highly misleading. I once had fevers that went to 104 as measured by a thermometer, and though my body was blazing hot, I *experienced* my body as chilled to the bone, because my immune system was pumping cytokine compounds into my blood and these in turn were messing with the tempreture regulation center in my brain.
I was misled by experience to feel chilly cold, when I was actually roasting. Instead of doing what I had to do to cool down, I rolled in blankets lay next to a heater and had temporary brain damage that left my tripping and falling over sidewalk cracks.
Luckily this was temporary.
So experience can be misleading as living hell.
And, FYI, I was in a room with a guy who was an expert at trance induction, and I could barely keep my pen in hand to take notes.
By contrast, I was far more alert and able to write after being doped with tranquilizers for a medical procedure.
Genpo, by advertising his method as insta enlightement, and charging the kind of money he does and calling it Zen has violated many of the Bohdisattava Precepts and failed to preserve the Treasures.
Here as a memory aid are the precepts.
I take refuge in Buddha, The Dharma and the Sangha.
I vow to
Avoid All Evil and Cultivate All Good
In the Live for the benefit of all beings (not just the wealthy)
To uphold forms and ceremonies and this includes not allowing ones own career or personality to become a distraction from the Dharma
I vow to beware of
Killing
Lying (and this includes misleading gestures and misleading silences)
Taking what has not been freely offered
Beware of abusing sexuality
Beware of darkening mind and body of self and other with intoxicants (which today include manipulated experiences of ecstacy, group thrills, trance, charisma, rhetoric and the pursuit of intoxicating fame/celebrity and mass marketing)
Beware of speech that brings injustice and disharmony where before there had been justice and harmony
Beware of praising self (or ones trademarked method) at expense of others
Beware of harboring ill will (by insinuating that people lower on the pecking order suffer from green memeitis
Beware of greed in relation to resources (and this includes greed for fame, media exposure, wealth, glamour and greed to rise higher on some abitrary 'evolutionary' scale or greed to get higher on Ken Wilbers rank scheme
And..to defend the Treasures of Buddha Dharma and Sangha such that
One does not distort Buddhadharma by suggesting additions that are any different from the guidelines left by Buddha in the Mahaparinbibbana Sutra
Whatever rank exists is not to give comfort to the powerholder but to support the practice of all, regardless of age, health, whether rich or poor.
Finally, Dogen advised to avoid fame.
If Genpo wants fame, its best that he leave Soto Zen. However, he gained his early fame while in Soto Zen and his later adverts showed him in his Zen Dharma Transmission robes.
Gaining fame while standing on the shoulders of Soto Zen is not cricket. That was the real problem.
Hey 4.43pm,
Your version of the precepts makes a few suggestions and additions that are different from the guidelines left by Buddha in the Mahaparinbibbana Sutra.
You really shouldn't do that, you know.

Right now I am reading Flaubert's book, "The Temptation of Saint Anthony."

"its a little scary to me that people make the argument that just because one person wears a funny robe and has a title that the other person in a relationship should be treated like a child"
Not so much that one is being treated like a child as much as the acknowledgement that this is not necessarily a relationship between equals on a relatively equal playing field
Same for the subordinates and the CEO example
As expressed above, sometimes it is hard to distinguish who is the victim
Persons in a position of power can also be victimized--by those who seek access to power through intimacy
I am just saying that it is hard to tell sometimes who the victim is. The kneejerk reaction is to hold the person holding the more powerful position responsible. Understandable. I am pointing out that this is not always the case. There are exceptions.
Sexual behavior between equals is one thing
things become distorted the wider the power /privilege differential.
Granted the distortion may be experienced by one or both participants as adding to the excitement.
watcha gonna do?
if your zen practice is based on heightened experiences, I guess you are going to look for heightened experiences
the zazen I am familiar with is boring
it isn't exciting to experience, it doesn't lead to particularly interesting states
Not that the state of boredom is without interest to me...

I agree. I am glad Brad has addressed the issue of Big Mind. That he has done something to keep the finger pointed towards it, amidst the distractions and confusions of a single human being's very private, very public problems.
The practices and discourses that help us shine a light on our own 'misfortune', our tendencies to blind ourselves to what 'relation' are gardens that need tending - lest too many of us stroll by, oblivious, into another 'too late'.
Western liberalism and capitalism (to dust off a few more weather-worn words) to my mind go hand in hand: reshaping, renewing, reifying (ouch) the 'buddhisms' we may be fortunate or unfortunate to encounter, or that the worst or the best of ourselves (mis?)target on our way.
The western 'individual' (which, yes, is a fiction here, factional) has seen the potential of Zen, hones a sophisticated stupidity, a new stagnancy, fresh hysterical responses to the plates left unwashed; nurtures the intellect under the guise of emptiness, re-translates grief into the play-pen of no-fault, and so on and so on.
The flames may be at rest, at ease, but they do burn.
"It's like I'm realising my worst fears about myself coming true" someone, an intimate, said to me yesterday.
"It's a good job you're not yourself then." I replied, off-the-cuff, and we shared a smile (thank god!)
That happened and it happened quite naturally. This morning, it was just something we said last night.
I know that if I tried to repeat that situation, that mote of something in a similar situation, I'd deserve to feel like a prick. Sooner, hopefully, rather than later.
More so, if I'd tried to justify it, one way or another (what with me being such a nice guy, a clever guy, quite often misunderstood.)
I hated what Brad has written about Iggy but when DS has joined in that [9:32 pm] it seems it might be worth a response.
Referring to the same quote DS quotes, - “When Iggy killed himself he did the deed in such a way as to ensure that his girlfriend … and that it would appear as though he killed himself because she broke up with him”.
People don’t kill themselves for nothing.
If a person goes as far as killing himself it would normally mean he was concerned with nothing else but what drove him into this, that it outshadowed his life, - that in his view there was no escape. Though this is not always true this is quite clearly iggy’s case.
The idea that he “did the deed in such a way as to ensure that … it would appear as though he killed himself because she broke up with him” seems to suck as severely as possible.
It seems much more probable that Brad & Co. were insincerely comforting the miserable girl.
Relate to the story as to a koan - which version would make more sense? I haven’t read the book but Brad’s case doesn’t easily stand. Carefully phrased.
One of my best friends killed himself at 34.
I'm not sure it was bad for him.
"Though this is not always true this is quite clearly iggy’s case."
How in the hell would you know? What a pompous ass. You make Mysterion look like a Christian Saint.
"It seems much more probable that Brad & Co. were insincerely comforting the miserable girl."
This also goes too far. How can you possibly draw this conclusion? You are being insensitive to all people involved.
Which do NOT include you.
Talking about a situation you know nothing about is the epitome of foolishness.
You, R, are a goddamn fool. Your opinions are worthless. SHUT THE FUCK UP.

Reading all the snide comments from these cool cyber-Buddhists makes my head ache...
Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurp!
Khru, take a buddaspirin, and Seagal sounds like he needs a buddalka seltzer.
What happened to this blog? Looks like it committed suicide. For several reasons.
All the regulars are taking a break. The trolls are rampant.
- “Though this is not always true this is quite clearly iggy’s case”.
I thought this might be misunderstood.
What is meant by “this is not always true” is that this would not necessarily apply in the case of a samurai performing Seppuku, in the case of Master Sensu jumping into the river I mentioned @ 10:05 am, [- “Sorry”] or in other cases very different from the ordinary [and I know some stupid is going to jump and say - “how can you say ‘ordinary’?” - but I won’t refer to that: - there’s a limit to the amount of explanations we can supply] way or form of miserable westerners killing themselves, sometimes for the silliest reasons, - generally not being able to attain this or that.
So the sentence my unworthy debater is first concerned about could be seen as unnecessary.
Take the sentence before the sentence both me and him have quoted: - Could you think of any case in which it would not be true? Other than a case of a truly great man which would clearly not apply to Iggy?
So far as for the first quote.
I hope you SWIM.
- “How can you possibly draw this conclusion?”, - I said - “it seems much more probable”. - And if you still hold your question: - It is because I am not the miserable asshole you very definitely seem to be.
- How about that?
You - like many - seem to imagine the minds of others follow the patterns and standards of your own, - which is not necessarily the case.
As the principle Dogen somewhere seems to mention, - weeds are abundant. - And now days are very confident too, - blindness assures and holds firm.
Still - just for the record, - [but not for ykw @ ykw] I may be wrong. I think it tells from the original post. Notice the “name” I used there. [11:36]

Hi moon face buddha,
Lately I've noticed your posts here as well on ZFI, so I'm assuming you check in here now and again. I find ZFI's TOS and house style a tad restrictive (I'm not sure if I'd have to start another BW thread - I don't want to - where this comment 'belongs', and so forth*). So, as this place is a free-for-all I'm taking the liberty of quoting over here a snippet of something you wrote over there a short while ago:
"...Genpo is still selling Big Mind (tm) and Brad is still selling Punk-Zen.
I'm not buying either."
What is "Punk-Zen"? I don't think Brad is selling "Punk-Zen". He IS selling books about Zen/Buddhism which include frequent references to his experience as a punk bass player in a punk band, and he does have an informal style of writing which might fairly be described as 'punk' (to me it just sounds informal, personal and a tad 'hip' - not exactly 'punk'. Whatever...). But the Zen/Buddhism that Brad writes about and tries to explain (teach?) in his books and his talks I would describe as Dogen's Zen as taught to Brad by his teacher.
The style may be 'punk' to you and some others, but the content is 'Buddhist'. No?
...I know - you still ain't buying it.
* If you fancy, suggest where I might post this on ZFI and...I may do.
108: Brad's problem is that Zen isn't for sale and Zen masters aren't supposed to covet fame. He said he needs to be famous to sell his books and he needs to sell books to make money. His unique skill set is such that he can make money writing about punk, Buddhism and lately sex. This isn't isn't an uninteresting formula but the formula could accurately be labeled "Punk-Zen" could it not?
Hi merciless,
I guess if the label "Punk-Zen" accurately sums up for you what Brad writes about and does, then...it's accurate. But to me the phrase sounds dismissive, and I don't like what Brad has to say - the substance of it - being quite so easily dismissed.
Brad's life choices don't bother me. There are the books and this blog. I own and have read HCZ and I've read bits of the others. There are some good bits in the books...I mean bits I liked. I met and heard Brad talk three times when he came to London a year or so ago. Nice guy. Nice talks. But having read what he's written, having seen him in RL --> next thing. My own teacher has had much more influence on what Zen/Buddhism means to me, so I don't look upon Brad as my teacher, or any kind of authority or exemplar. But - whether I agree with his take on individual issues or not - I do value what he's saying and that he's saying it.
I have no problem with punk, or sex, or anything at all being written about from a 'Buddhist' point of view. Neither - for me - does writing about those things amount to a "Punk-Zen formula". I don't see writing, publishing, promoting and selling books on Buddhism as a 'problem', although I can see how the concomitant fame/reputation might create difficulties. They're not my difficulties, though. And those things, in themselves, don't invalidate what Brad has to say. Not for me.
Hi 108..
I rather like Brad when I'm not disliking him. :) I'm just getting tired of his shtick. Maybe the things that make him a good Buddhist hurt him as a writer.
Always derivative, he has become calculated, formulaic, repetitive.. I think he might be played out artistically. Maybe he's only going through a rough patch before he FINALLY matures.
I hear ya and understand whereof you speak, merciless. We'll see innit :)
but I hope it this blog doesn't become the TMZ of the Zen community.
This blog is more criticism of other teachers than anything else.
It is kinda weird.

The Cumberland City Council questioned Mayor Carl Hatfield concerning the financial report during a meeting on Tuesday. A city vehicle that had been sold as surplus was the subject of a heated discussion.
Council member David Dixon brought up the matter of the vehicle.
“It (the financial report) has surplus police car $100. We were supposed to have been paid $700,” said Dixon.
“Actually the car was $800 and there was $100 paid on it. For some reason payments were left to be paid that we didn’t agree to. It only shows here $100. So the car only sold for $200?” asked council member Charles Raleigh.
Mayor Carl Hatfield explained the circumstances behind the deal.
“The council member bought that car from us,” said Hatfield. “He paid $100 down with the agreement that he would not accept his $600 council pay. Then he paid the other $100.”
According to members of council, the transaction is not shown correctly in the report.
“The money should be shown under income that it came back in after the check was issued,” said Dixon.
“We didn’t issue the check,” explained Hatfield. “The money stayed in the general fund. The $100 you see there is his balance of the $800 he owed on the car.”
“How did the agreement come back to even let him pay payments?” asked Raleigh. “We were supposed to sell that for $800 cash.”
“He was without a car,” said Hatfield. “The city didn’t lose a dime.”
Council member Carolyn Elliot pointed out there could be some bookkeeping problems.
“You sold an item for $600, you only got $100,” said Elliot. “Somewhere in the books it should show that $500 has not been paid. You can’t just keep money in there without paying it out.”
“It’s going to look like the money was saved during the year,” said Raleigh. “You should have paid it out and put it back in.”
Dixon stated there could be problems during the next audit.
“The auditor’s going to come in here next January and show that we had a check for $600 that never came back,” said Dixon.
“It’s just a matter of record keeping,” said Elliot. “I don’t keep records at home like that, we sure shouldn’t do it in city hall.”
“I don’t know what you’re going to do about it, but like David said I believe it’s going to be caught by the auditor,” said Raleigh.
Hatfield said that the city did not lose any money.
“We’ve got records that show nobody profited from this deal,” said Hatfield.
In other council activity:
* Jim “Muggins” Bennett and Cleon Cornett were presented with the key to the city for their service to the city;
* A Motion was passed to adjust future meeting agendas to include sections for old business and new business;
* A motion was passed to replace the light bulbs in city hall.

After helping to lead the Black Bears to their second regional title in three seasons, Harlan County running back Jake Middleton and defensive back Treyvon Long were named second team all-state on Friday by the Associated Press. Harlan County linebacker Carson Whitehead and Harlan quarterback Ty Saragas were named honorable mentions, while Long was also named an honorable mention at wide receiver.
Middleton led the state’s top rushing attack with 2,141 yards and 29 touchdowns in 2012. Long had four interceptions on the defensive side of the ball, while Whitehead led the team in tackles with 191 stops.
“That is a pretty big honor. It is selected by the sportswriters and it’s pretty hard to achieve something like that. As a coach, I have had very few players to earn that honor, and even honorable mention is something to be proud of,” said Harlan County coach Tom Larkey. “All of these kids have really put in a lot of time, and this just shows that that their talent has been recognized throughout the state. I am really proud of them.”
Saragas helped to change the football identity during his time at Harlan. Because of his talents under center, the Green Dragons transitioned from a ground-oriented attack to relying more on the passing game. As a senior, Saragas completed 121-of-210 passes for 1,902 yards and 23 touchdowns.
“Ty deserves to be in that select group. He has really worked hard and is very intelligent,” said Harlan coach J.B. Donahue. “Ty has put a lot of time and work into his craft, and I am glad that he is getting recognized for it.”
Louisville Trinity’s James Quick was named Mr. Football. Quick hauled in 85 passes for 1,416 yards and 16 touchdowns as a senior.
Pleasure Ridge Park’s Jason Hiser was named the state’s coach of the year..
The AP All-State teams included:, Harlan.
The definition of overlook: to look over or at from a higher place.

This is comment #3 which will not get published because it is totally off topic. Guess I will have to start calling attention on the more visited free speech sites such as Facebook and Twitter. We will create a page just so everyone can see how fed up the county is with your garbage. Thank you!

[29] Not to be ignored, the rarified atmosphere in high level scientific research journals has been politicized – most outrageous is the censorship of a genetic-immunologic study (by a leading international team of scientists) showing the close genetic relationship, if not identity between Levantine Jews and Palestinians. University libraries around the world were advised to ‘tear-out’ (eyes closed) the offending study from the pages of the journal, Human Immunology, lest such data might undermine the racist ‘raison d’etre’ for an exclusively Jewish State.

Three of the nine justice s,Ginsberg, Breyer and Kagan, are Zionists unwilling to challenge the Executive usurpation of war powers and promotion of torture and rendition. The others are all affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. Not a single Protestant-affiliated Justice (numerically the majority religion in the US ) has been appointed to the Supreme Court since the 1990 appointment of respected constitutional scholar, David Souter (by George Bush the First), because of their ‘unreliability’ (code-word for upholding the Bill of Rights and Constitution). The recent appointment of Justice Elena Kagan, whose lackluster academic career did not deter uber-Zionist Laurence Summers from appointing her Dean of the Harvard Law School, uderscores the mediocre criteria used in the high judiciary. The most recent appointment of Sonya Sotomayor to replace the brilliant (and Zionistically ‘unreliable’) J.P. Stevens, was promoted heaviliy for the Supreme Court on the basis of her strong ties to Israel, starting with her first (of many) ‘leadership’ tours to Israel (see The Jewish Chronicle – Life story Israel trips tie Sotomayor to Jews, Ron Kampeas – May 26, 2009).

Hi, I'm Emma. I'm 17 and I live in Shropshire, England. I love music and the works of Tolkien. I like to overuse the wink face and I live a life which predominantly revolves around Downton Abbey, Thomas Howes, Dan Stevens and Elijah Wood. I'm also really into Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Jane Austen and learning random new musical instruments.
I am a happy person, and I love to make other people laugh and smile. I've just started studying for my A levels in English literature, history and music. I'm hoping to go on to university next year to study music.
At first glance, this blog probably looks like an oddly-named fandom appreciation blog, but it's actually my personal blog. I'm just really obsessive, K?
I hope you enjoy my blog. I won't delete it this time. Promise. :)
Kickass Violet. XD

When Did the Potters Go Into Hiding?
this wiki
Forum page
During her 2007 appearance at Carnegie Hall, JKR mentioned that Lily and James were full-time fighters for the Order "until Lily fell pregnant with Harry" and "then they went into hiding," which contradicts her 2004 World Book Day statement that it "looked as if the Potters would have to go into hiding" at the time of Harry's christening. In the 2005 MuggleNet/Leaky Cauldron interview, however, she stated, "At the time that they christened Harry, they were in hiding," leaving open the possibility that they went into hiding before Harry was born.
It seems JKR changed her mind about when the Potters went into hiding between writing OotP and HBP. In DH33, when we see Snape go to beg Dumbledore to keep Lily safe, it's autumn ("...the sound of the wind in the branches" and "Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them..."). This scene could thus fall in late 1979, when Lily was a couple of months pregnant, or in late 1980, when Harry was a few months old. But late 1979 seems more likely, given that the prophecy was worded "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches," not "has arrived," implying its subject wasn't born at the name Trelawney made it.
The order of events thus seems to be:
- Autumn 1979: Lily finds out she's pregnant.
- Autumn 1979: Snape overhears Trelawney making the prophecy
- Autumn 1979: Snape tells Voldemort about it and he targets the Potters.
- Autumn 1979: Snape goes to Dumbledore, seeking protection for Lily.
- The Potters go into hiding.
- July 1980: Harry is born while his parents are in hiding.
This leaves open the question of how Voldemort learned Lily was pregnant, much less expecting a boy, but I think there's enough evidence from various sources to support the above order of events.
What does everyone else think? ★ Starstuff (Owl me!) 00:08, August 7, 2011 (UTC)
- I would say that the 2007 statement would be the more "official" as it is the latest statement made by Rowling. However, personally, I think that a large amount of time in hiding is unfeasible since it means that Pettigrew waited a long time before betraying the Potters. Perhaps this is one of the things that Pottermore will clear up in the coming months. - Cavalier One
(Wizarding Wireless Network) 00:30, August 7, 2011 (UTC)
- I'm revamping the Lily Evans article to include more known canonical information and I was wondering how to cover information about the Potters going into hiding. Personally, I always had a bit of trouble accepting that Pettigrew's betray came suddenly, I'd find it more believable if the Potters were in hiding for two years and he had that long to progressively grow frightened enough to sell them out. ★ Starstuff (Owl me!) 02:38, August 7, 2011 (UTC)
- I'm inclined to agree with Cav and go with the more recent interview. After all, Lily's letter to Sirius in Deathly Hallows mentions Peter visiting them around Harry's birthday in late July, and they still weren't killed for another three months, so it's not unreasonable to think he'd been conflicted enough to wait for quite some time before betraying them. Then again, we all know the REAL reason is simply because it's J. K. "I hate teh maths" Rowling. - Nick O'Demus 10:26, August 7, 2011 (UTC)
- Snape has overheard the prophecy in late 1979 or early 1980. It must have been later than Halloween 1979, because Harry was born on 31st July 1980, so he was conceived around Halloween 1979.
- Snape asks Dumbledore to protect Lily after Harrys birth, because they talk about "her son". The weather is not necessarily in autumn, it could well be winter or early spring, when the dry leaves are still around. But if we assume that it is autumn, then it would be in 1981, because it would take even Voldemort some time to find out about all children born at the end of July 1980 to parents who have thrice defeated him. (The prophecy could also be referring to Neville Longbottom, but by attacking Harry, Voldemort "marks him as his equal".)
- So lets say Snape talks to Dumbledore in autumn 1981 and tells him, Voldemort thinks the prophecy is referring to Harry. Dumbledore warns the Potters and they use the Fidelius Charm to go into hiding. BUT only because they change to Pettigrew as Secret Keeper at the last moment, he is able to betray them. I think that he did it immediately, because Sirius talks about how happy he must have been realising that he could be of great service to his secret master. No sense in waiting, imho.

Wizard who killed a ChimaeraTalk0
10,963Edit
- This character is most likely a reference to Bellerophon, an ancient Greek hero who defeated the mythical Chimaera from the back of the winged horse Pegasus. He also collapsed from his steed after the encounter, but not from exhaustion; he felt that his defeat of the Chimaera was enough to earn him a place among the gods, and attempted to fly to Mount Olympus. He was stopped by Zeus, who sent a gadfly to bite Pegasus and make Bellerophon fall off. Futhermore, he did not die from the fall, but was merely injured enough to live out the rest of his days as a blinded, crippled hermit.[2]

The Agassiz Zoological Club is named in honor of Prof. Louis Agassiz, the founder of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. (see site: harvardbioblitz.tumblr.com/)
Times: ROUGHLY midnight Sunday, May 1 to midnight Monday, May 2
Location of coordinating center – MCZ Labs, 4th floor
What is a BioBlitz? Over 24 hours, the total plant and animal life of the area will be cataloged to the best of our ability and recorded in a public database hosted by the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). Over time, the HUCBB will provide an invaluable record of the changes in diversity over time, and the types of species present on campus.
When will this happen? The BioBlitz will begin at midnight on Sunday, May 1st and continue through midnight on Monday, May 2nd. Volunteers will lead taxa-specific sampling expeditions across the campus, cataloguing plant, insect, bird, etc. life. Samples will be identified in the field or sorted under microscopes.
How do I participate? Show up at any point over the 24 hours, either at our sampling location (see below) or at the coordinating center at the MCZ Labs. Student experts will lead guided nature walks for each trip, provide collecting equipment, and help with specimen identification. See which trips you are interested in – we’ll be leading them all day!
Locations: North Area – Harvard Yard, MCZ Labs area, Radcliffe Quadrangle
Southern Area – River Houses, Charles River
How can I get involved?:
Email the AZC above, and cc Adam, atclark@fas.harvard.edu. We are looking for volunteers who would like to attend guided walks, taxonomists and naturalist who would like to guide walks, and photographers or writers who would like to record events.
Sampling Trips (as of April 21):
All images from 2010 BioBlitz. All corny trip names are solely Adam’s fault.
1) 9AM-12PM: “The birds and the bees” - insect and avifauna of the the Arnold Arboretum.
a. A guided tour of the forests, fields, and rills of the Arnold Arboretum. We will be looking at local insects and birds, and will collect data for part of a New England-wide inventory of pollinators.
b. At 10:30AM, we’re meeting up with Robert Mayer, a naturalist at the AA, to go on a guided birding trip of the facilities.
c. MEET AT Harvard Yard subway entrance (by “the Pit”) at 8:30AM
2) 2PM-4PM: “A walk in the woods” - guided walk featuring the plants of Harvard Yard
a. Taking advantage of Harvard Yard’s tree map, we will visit and identify plants from around the campus.
b. MEET AT John Harvard state at 2PM
3) 4PM-6PM: “Sleeping with the fishes” - fish and aquatic arthropods of the Charles River, by the Harvard Woman’s boathouse
a. Using water nets and seines, we will collect fish, insects, larvae, and other aquatic animals to record the diversity of the Charles River. Waders or sandals are highly encouraged.
b. MEET AT Women’s Boat House at 4PM
4) 12AM-2AM: “Three sheets to the wind” - light trapping for nocturnal insects
a. We will set up light traps in the MCZ courtyard to see the local insect wildlife.
b. MEET OUTSIDE the Harvard Geological Building (by 26 Oxford St.) at 12AM.
Insects and arthropods, round 1.
Arthropod pitfall samples have finally been sorted! Three pitfall traps were placed at each of seven sites, and left open for about 24 hours. Where possible, insects were later sorted to family, arthropods to order. Results from hand collecting and light trapping at night will be available later this fall.
Data tables are available through Google Docs here:.
Pictures of each specimen can be found hosted by Google Picassa at. Images are named by (site code)_(taxonomy)_(number of individuals)_(morphospecies code). Below is a summary of findings.
Please keep in mind that “individuals” data is sketchy at best. When many (>10) individuals were present, they were not counted.

Fantastic, a whole family of hawks right where I buy my groceries!
The Boston Globe reports on a family of red-tailed hawks that is nesting right by the Fresh Pond Parkway in West Cambridge.
Watch the video! It really shows how people have a great innate enthusiasm for nature when it’s pointed out to them. I’ve noticed that the ‘aha!’ moment tends to be when they can make a connection between what they’re seeing with their own eyes with something they’ve read in a magazine or see on TV. For biology educators the challenge is to trigger the thought: “I never thought I’d see this with my own eyes!”

We are about half done ID-ing the pitfall and light trap samples. We have photos of them all, and will post them soon!
Rob’s Sightings
Rob Gogan emailed us recently with the following notes.
This morning (5-3-10) on my way to campus, I saw these birds:
- Magnolia warbler high among young leaves and catkins of white oak tree across the street from Shannon Hall
- Goldfinch flying over Charles near Weld Boat House
- Warblers high in elms in Harvard Yard
In the blog for 5-2, I suggest you add to the caption of the gorgeous ink-cap mushroom photo that the host tree is an American Elm.
Also, please add to the Radcliffe Yard part of the blog that we stopped at the Radcliffe crabapple tree. This tree nearly died when Harvard discussed fully merging with Radcliffe in the mid-90’s. Then, Harvard announced that the Radcliffe name would live on as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study was announced. A new crabapple was planted next to the old one at this time. Suddenly, the old tree burst into new life, and has thrived ever since.
As we pondered it, Chris noticed a palm warbler flitting among its leaves. Rob saw it poke its beak into a tube-rolled leaf and extract a fat green larva, which it ate in three or four bites.
Also, I suggest that you add that Sam spotted some lichen with fruiting bodies growing on the north side of the giant pre-Columbian, Central American stone sphere behind Tozzer Library.
Also on the giant sphere (from Costa Rica) was a fat insect larva of some kind, a few spiders, and lots of tiny red mites…
Thanks Rob!
That Big Mushroom…
Gen Lewis-Gentry at the Farlow Herbarium took a look at our Stropharia photo and suggested that it might be Stropharia rugoso-annulata. It’s one of the common mushrooms seen around the area, and was first described by William Farlow himself (picture of Farlow below, from HUH website).
Farlow was Professor of Cryptogamic Botany at Harvard from 1879 until the turn of the century, and helped to establish botany (then including mycology) as a scientific discipline in the country. His description of Stropharia rugoso-annulata was published posthumously in the Icones Farlowianae, which has sumptuous color lithograph plates illustrating each of the species described - each printing is slightly different because the stones were all inked by hand. The type was described from Massachusetts, and was ‘rare’ at the time, but it’s now very common growing on mulched beds, which was where we found it (in a flowerbed in the Div School).
The character to look out for, apparently, is the annulus around the stipe, which has a star-shaped appearance when seen head-on. The cap is chestnut-brown with a purplish hue, and the spores are ‘snuff-brown’. Back in the day when most people would know the color of snuff very well….
Fish is now IDed!
The small fish we pulled out of the Charles has been identified by Prof. Farrell as a juvenile Largemouth Bass.

*A representative from Colorado Parks and Wildlife will join us for a tour of this 1600-acre conservation project.
Please remember that “easy” and “moderate” are relative terms, and at altitude and in mountainous, rugged terrain, challenges exist. All hikes require suitable capability and acclimation, as well as water, hat, raingear, sunscreen, lunch, hiking boots and sense of adventure. All distances are approximate. Registered hikers meet at the Crested Butte Visitors Center parking lot at 8 AM and carpool to trailheads (please bring vehicles).
Our online reservation system makes hike registration easy. To reserve space for the next week’s hike, visit after 5 PM on the Wednesday prior to the hike you’d like to join. (If you have no internet access, you may call 349-7104, ext. 3).
We will continue to abide by Forest Service regulations and environmental ethics, limiting our group size to a maximum of 15 people (or fewer in certain Wilderness Areas) each week. (Please, no pets.) We encourage you to register early and bring your friends to introduce to these majestic mountains and to High Country Citizens' Alliance.
Thank you for your participation and support for our conservation work over the years. With your help, we will continue to prevent a molybdenum mine from encroaching on our public lands, water and communities, as well as advocate for sound management and wilderness designations for environmentally sensitive public lands.
We look forward to seeing you on the trail!
Sincerely,
Sue Navy

At first glance, the article seems hopeful. Divorce has "lost its groove," the New York Times headline proclaims, or at least it has among the hipster-Brooklyn crowd.
.”
“The notion of divorce has become one of failure again,” said 42-year-old Stacy Morrison of Park Slope, an author of another divorce memoir. “It used to be, ‘You’re free, rock on!’ Now it’s, ‘You couldn’t make it work, you failed.’ ”
The article continued on by declaring, "Among a certain demographic, marriage is viewed as something that, like work-life balance, yoga and locavore cuisine, needs to be continually worked at and improved upon."
Bizarre comparisons aside, the piece does a good job discussing last year's study by the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, which revealed a trend of college-educated Americans divorcing at significantly lower rates than the rest of the population. For instance:.
So that's the good news. What I find unsettling is the article's conclusion.
Because these "children of divorce" -- the latchkey kids of the '70s and '80s -- suffered profoundly the effects of their parents' split, they will go to great lengths to ensure their own children's happiness after they undergo a divorce, themselves. At what point, though, does this just because a band-aid solution for the parents' own wounds -- assuaging their guilt for putting their children through a similar situation to what they faced in their youth?.”
.”
I'll be clear -- if it's a matter of kids living in an abusive environment, then their safety is absolutely a priority. But, "humane" or not, let's not glamorize the fact that even modern-day children of divorce still lack the stability and security of a two-parent home, as well as the love of their mother and father for each other that serves as a foundation for that home.

As told to
Michelle Badash, MS
Patricia is a 32-year-old criminology professor at a state university. She is married and has a five-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter. They live in the suburban area where her husband grew up.
What was your first sign that something was wrong? What symptoms did you experience?
I first had a problem in graduate school when I developed a rapid pulse rate and high blood pressure for no understandable reason. I would also get hot flashes. Shortly thereafter, I developed the worst headache I’d ever had behind my right eye and on the right side of my head. I went to the university clinic to see a doctor there. After an initial exam, he concluded I had a migraine, along with other problems. He prescribed some medication that helped a bit.
What was the diagnosis experience like?
I saw various doctors at the university clinic. I had insurance that only covered my visits to the clinic and really did not cover specialists. I was referred to a cardiologist eventually, but not a neurologist or headache specialist until just about 6 months ago (I’m now in a new state with new insurance).
What was your initial and then longer-term reaction to the diagnosis?
I had heard of migraines, and discovered that my mother experienced “painless migraines”. I was very uninformed and just assumed it was a headache, something I’d deal with from time to time. Now I realize that migraines are not just headaches, and dealing with chronic migraines is more of a challenge than I’d ever have imagined.
How do you manage your disease?
I am currently managing this disease, but not very well. I have tried several types of medication: five migraine abortives, eight rescue pain medications, and five migraine preventives. I am currently taking two preventives—Prozac and Atenolol. I use two abortives—Amerge and Relafen (which is more of a rescue) when a migraine hits, and I use either Darvocet or Fioricet as a rescue, but only 2 times a week—same for the Amerge and Relafen.
Recently, I began to have menstrual migraines for the first time. For this type of migraine, I am now trying Relafen 2 times a day starting 2-3 days before I expect the headache (which is hard for me because I am irregular). I also use Benadryl (generic), ginger, and/or Reglan (generic) for nausea. Now I can knock out the nausea within an hour, which is a new and wonderful thing!
I am also trying “alternatives”—I recently started taking 500 mg of feverfew every day, and I do see some improvement. I also take magnesium and vitamin B2. Since I am prone to stomach ulcers, I have to be careful with the feverfew, B2, and Relafen. So I also take ginger for nausea or upset stomach, and drink chamomile tea when my stomach hurts. I take Tums during the day if necessary, but not within two hours of taking any medication.
Without my husband, I couldn’t do what I do. He’s learned what to do when a migraine hits: he immediately gets me coffee or diet coke, makes toast for me to eat when I take medication, etc. And even my five-year-old son will trot over with sunglasses, because light (even from the television) hurts my eyes.
I joined two on-line support groups to get and give support. I did not realize there were so many people struggling with the same disease. I have done a lot of research—books, websites, journal articles—on migraine, stroke, epilepsy, anything I can get my hands on.
Most importantly, I was referred to a headache clinic and work with a doctor and nurse practitioner who specialize in migraines and work closely with me. I’ve had to take my health firmly into my own hands and help direct my care. I’m not particularly assertive, but this disease has made me so, at least as far a migraine care is concerned.
Did you have to make any lifestyle or dietary changes in response to your illness?
I’ve made LOTS of changes. I go to bed at the same (early) time every night now. I get up early in the morning to avoid any “sleeping in” headaches that can morph into a migraine. I drink just about the same amount of caffeine every day—not too much, not too little—to avoid caffeine withdrawal headache and allow the caffeine to help me. I kept a food journal for four months, trying to identify a food trigger (to no avail). I drink almost no alcohol now because I fear it might trigger a headache. I try to exercise almost daily to release endorphins that might help.
I cut back on committee work on campus to avoid very heavy stress, since stress is the only trigger I identified. I also make sure to drink as much water as I can every day, because that seems to help. And mostly, I just try to stay healthy. I take a lot of vitamins now. I recently bought some books on meditation and relaxation and plan to look into this as well.
Did you seek any type of emotional support?
I seek emotional support from my family and from the two online support groups. Sometimes people who do not have this disease do not understand it. They have the attitude, “take some aspirin and get over it.” But it’s not that easy. So it’s really helpful to know others have the same problem and go through the same stuff.
Did/does your condition have any impact on your family?
Well, both my five year old and three year old know what a migraine is. I have missed some birthday parties (for their friends), trips to the theater, school parties or events, trips to the zoo… all because of the migraines. That can upset my kids, but all in all, they handle it well. My husband is nothing but supportive, though I don’t think he really understands the disease—but then, neither do I. The rest of my family lives far away, and I don’t think they have any idea what migraines have been like for me.
What advice would you give to anyone living with this condition?
I would tell anyone living with this condition several things:
Read as much as you can about this disease so you can have an informed conversation with your doctors.
Find a specialist right away—not just a neurologist, but a headache/migraine specialist.
Listen to that specialist—give the medications and/or therapy a try no matter how bizarre it sounds.
Most importantly, trust yourself. If a medication is making you sick or making things worse, tell your doctor firmly that you need to discontinue it.
Try alternative therapies like herbs, acupuncture, etc. under the direction of your doctor (or at least informing him/her).
Tell your family and friends what migraines are like so they can have some understanding of what you are going through.
Know your rights at work, in case you need to take a step back and slow down.
Find people who will listen to you and not judge you—online support groups are really great that way!
Interviews were conducted in the past and may not reflect current standards and practices in medicine. Talk to your doctor to learn more about how this condition is diagnosed and managed today and what treatment approaches are right for you.

Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) announced Monday he would not run for reelection in 2012. Frank is the powerful ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee and co-author of a controversial 2010 law regulating the financial services industry, colloquially referred to as “Dodd-Frank.”
The following statements from finance.
“Barney Frank spent much of his career expanding the powers of and defending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which have been involved in multi-billion-dollar scandals that helped enrich their corporate leaders, inflate a housing bubble until it burst, and spark the financial crisis. Even after watching Fannie and Freddie pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines because of their corrupt practices, Frank left them untouched in the ‘Dodd-Frank’ financial regulatory bill that was supposed to address the causes of the financial crisis.
“Frank has been shameless in using Fannie and Freddie as social engineering and income redistribution tools. Unfortunately, Maxine Waters, who apparently will fill his slot as ranking member, has shown herself to be every bit as shameless.”

“While I didn’t agree with many of Rep. Frank’s ideas, he was always smart, thoughtful, and very funny. As a former state legislator, furthermore, he was one of the few members of Congress who really understood insurance. He will be missed.”

“We can expect to see more longtime Washington insiders retiring before next year’s elections. Although he may well have personal reasons for leaving, Frank is smart enough to see that the public is disgusted with Congress and its inability to rein in spending. His high-spending voting record would have been an intolerable millstone in any forthcoming challenge for his.

Nothing is better than a concert by one of your favorite bands…..and it’s even better when it’s FREE! I went to the Mohegan Sun Casino Friday night to catch Ace Frehley live in concert at the Wolf Den. For those of you who haven’t been, the Wolf Den is an intimate club that sits right in the heart of the casino surrounded by the sounds of slot machines and gaming tables. The Wolf Den holds about 400 people and it usually brings in some of the better known Hard Rock acts. Earlier in the month, Kix played there and Helix is coming in April! A lot of tribute acts get on that stage and play for the casino patrons as well.
Being a KISS fan, I knew that an Ace Frehley solo show would bring tons of New England KISS fans to the casino so my friend and I got there for 3:30 in the afternoon (showtime was 8pm), had a nice meal at one of the buffets, and got in line around 5pm. As predicted, the KISS Army came out in force. We counted and we were within the first 50 people but the line stretched to over the 400 capacity. The cool thing about the Wolf Den is that it is primarily open so you can see the show from the casino floor, there were people three deep around the arena and many fans took over slot machines close by to take in the show. We had a great table inside, very close to the stage with a perfect view, so I didn’t run down to the front when Ace and the band came on. Ace was joined by Scot Coogan (drums/vocals) and Anthony Esposito (bass/vocals), who both played on his new record, ANOMALY, as well as, new guitarist Todd Youth.
Ace Frehley setlist:
Intro – Fractured Mirror
Rocket Ride
Parasite
Snow Blind
Sister
Pain In The Neck
Into The Void
Speedin’ Back To My Baby
Rock Soldiers
Love Her All I Can
Talk To Me
2000 Man
Strange Ways
New York Groove
Rip It Out
Hard Times
Shock Me
Ace guitar solo (w/smoking guitar)
Let Me Know outro
Shout It Out Loud
Encore:
Deuce
Love Gun
Cold Gin
This was a great concert…..a KISS diehard’s dream! Ace and his band came out and put on an energetic show full of Ace solo and KISS classics. Not surprisingly, Ace and the band focused on most KISS material that featured Ace either as lead singer or primary songwriter. It was extremely cool to hear deep tracks like ‘Rocket Ride’, ‘Strange Ways’, ‘Hard Times’ and ‘Talk To Me’, songs that were rarely played live by KISS during their ’70s heyday. Ace also pulled out 4 songs from his 1978 KISS solo record (‘New York Groove’, ‘Rip It Out’, ‘Speedin’ Back To My Baby’, ‘Snow Blind’) and 2 brand new songs off ANOMALY (‘Sister’ & ‘Pain In The Neck’) but one of the most gratifying songs of the set for me was ‘Rock Soldiers’ from the first Frehley’s Comet album…..to this day, Frehley’s Comet is one of my all-time favorite bands. The ’78 solo album songs were great also, the Ace album was my favorite by the four members and it was so cool to finally hear ‘Rip It Out’ and ‘Snow Blind’ live. I thought ‘Sister’ came out great live and Ace announced that this was the first performance of ‘Pain In The Neck’ ever so we got a little extra KISStory at the show. The audience was mostly KISS fans so all the KISS classics got huge ovations, as did the entire set. ‘Parasite’, ‘Shock Me’ and ‘Shout It Out Loud’ were all great but the encore really brought the house down with cool versions of ‘Deuce’, ‘Love Gun’ and ‘Cold Gin’. Ace also managed to get in a great guitar solo complete with his signature smoking guitar and then he was joined by the band to complete the ‘Let Me Know’ outro solo with the signature KISS moves…..something that got the crowd really going! What a show! Ace and the band played 20 songs in an hour and 45 minutes, including an extended guitar solo and the opening into tape of ‘Fractured Mirror’ from the ’78 solo record…..so it was really 22 songs worth of time! You can’t ask for much more! It was a great show at a great venue for a great price…..FREE!
Definitely catch Ace on tour if you can…..check out Ace Frehley.com for tour dates.

[Edited on 2010-10-22 to describe how to use TextEdit to apply this key mapping]
[Edited on 2010-11-12 to mention that TextEdit sometimes adds a .txt extension]
I'm a longtime Windows user who recently purchased a Macbook. Overall I'm very impressed with the machine, but it does have a learning curve, especially for the key bindings.
The first thing I noticed was that the Macbook does not have the Del and Ins keys at all, and the Home, End, PageUp and PageDown keys require pressing 'Fn' and then an Arrow key (which is understandable because the keyboard on a small Macbook is somewhat cramped -- also, I've asked a couple users who have not used PCs much before using a Mac, and they did not even know these keys existed, or what they would do with them)
However, when I'm not on the road, I like to use a nice full sized Microsoft Natural Keyboard, to reduce tendinitis. As a (former) hard-core programmer, I very extensively use the Home, End, PageUp and PageDown keys to quickly navigate code or text documents. I was very dismayed to discover that Apple pretty much doesn't do anything with these keys.
In hunting through all the configuration options, I noticed that you can reconfigure a lot of key mappings through the System Preferences utility (go to the apple in the upper-left corner, select System Preferences..., click on Keyboard & Mouse, and click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab). This was useful for a start, but I quickly determined that the Mac wouldn't allow me to bind keys to any of the 6 special keys (Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, Delete, Insert). This made me sad.
I did discover, however, that it is possible to switch the Control and Command keys. This is a big help because now all the windows favorites like Ctrl+c for copy, Ctrl+v for paste, Ctrl+x for cut, and Ctrl+z for undo now work the same on both systems. I still switch frequently between Windows and Mac platforms, so it's very nice to have the same key mappings.
Most recently, I discovered that there is a special file you can create that allows special mappings to the 6 special keys. This made me happy. I was now able to get much closer to having a unified key mapping. For more details, see this article.
To do this, create a new file called
~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dictand put the following text into it (You'll probably have to create the directory the first time -- this is okay).
/* ~ */ }
Remember: These key mappings assume that you've switched Control and Command. If you don't want to make this switch, replace each @ (command) with ^ (control).
Here are steps to take to apply these changes:
- Open TextEdit under the Applications folder. If TextEdit was already open, create a new document using File->New. There should be a window labeled 'Untitled'.
- Select the text within the window above, copy it, and then paste it into your new TextEdit window.
- In TextEdit, convert this to plain text (the default is rich text) by selecting Format->Make Plain Text.
- Next, select File->Save As... In the "Save As" dialog box, navigate to your home directory (look under PLACES on the left side for a house picture that has your name next to it). In your home directory, double-click on the Library folder. If you see a KeyBindings folder then double-click on it. If not, then click on "New Folder" (within the Library directory), name the new folder KeyBindings (with no space), and then double-click on it. Type
DefaultKeyBinding.dictfor the filename (at the top) and then click Save.
- Warning: TextEdit will sometimes try to 'help' you by appending a .txt extension to the filename. Make sure this doesn't happen. If asked to use a .txt extension, tell TextEdit to instead use .dict. It will not work if you use .txt. If you have trouble, see comment by Nathan below.
- Before these changes take effect, you need to log out and then log back in.
There you have it! I know this emulation isn't perfect (not all applications honor this mapping), but it's a good start. Please drop comments if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements.
Thanks much! I've been looking for something like this.
Perfect! Many thanks, that's very helpful!
thank you so very very very much!
Thanks for this post! They all seem to work for me on Leopard 10.5.6, except for one. I am having trouble making Shift-Insert work for paste. Strangely, Shift-Delete works for cut just fine. Any ideas?
Aaron: This is a problem that I have in other non-Cocoa applications as well. I really do miss the Shift-Insert paste option, because I use my left-hand for the mouse, and my right hand for cursor navigation and cut/copy/paste (at least on Windows systems). On Mac, having to use Ctrl/Cmd-V forces me to either take my hand off the mouse, or move my right hand to the left-side of the keyboard, either of which slows me down.
I suspect that the 'Insert' key is actually some kind of help key on Macs -- pressing Insert sometimes changes the mouse cursor to a question mark. A real Mac keyboard doesn't even have the Insert key, but has the 'fn' key in it's place (which is completely different than Insert).
I think that the bindings to the Insert key are at a higher level and have to be remapped using a different approach. Since this key is not on any standard mac keyboard, I suspect it may be a low-level hack. I would be very interested in finding this out too!
Thanks a lot for your perfect work! It'll be cool if Shift + Insert became work too... Let's keep us informed! // Dmitry Kovba
moveWordBackwardAndModifySelection doesn't work too:( // Dmitry Kovba
WRT moveWorkBackwardAndModifySelection not working, it seems Cocoa doesn't like the $ to be infront of the @
I was able to make it work using this minor change:
"@$\UF702" = "moveWordBackwardAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Cmd + Leftarrow */
"@$\UF703" = "moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Cmd + Rightarrow */
Thanks for the suggestion to swap shift and cmd! I've confirmed that this works and have modified the code with this change.
Cool, so in addition to swapping $ and @, I have another binding suggestion for you. Many times I've hit delete to backspace by word which is the windows behaviour. On mac, it deletes the whole line! So, here's another binding to try:
"@\U007F" = "deleteWordBackward:"; // cmd + delete left
Kevin G
Oops, I had a typo in my previous comment, I intended to write that on Windows backspace that deletes by word. -- Kevin G
Thanks a lot for your post - it made my life a lot easier.
However, I managed to switch command and control on the desktop applications as you suggested, but they don't switch in the terminal - do you know how to do that in the terminal as well?
@Anonymous: For Mac Terminal.app key bindings, I wrote up a brief discussion here:
This doesn't include ctrl and cmd, but will hopefully give enough information to get started... :)
Awesome, thanks for this info!
I'd like to switch my control and command keys like you mentioned but then I can't quite get used to pressing ctrl+tab to switch applications. Do you know if it's possible to change that shortcut?
Noah: I haven't found a way to change ctrl+tab to alt+tab for switching windows, so I've been having to re-learn that aspect of the windowing system. I would be interested if anyone else finds a way to change this... :)
I ended up not switching the Control and Command keys; instead I added Keyboard Shortcuts for All Applications, setting ^C for Copy, ^Z for Undo, etc. This way I can keep my precious Alt+Ta... oops, I mean Command+Tab :)
Thanks for posting here I have switched the Control and Command keys, what is the next step (where I have to past your code..?). Please explain me once. I am not familiar with programming. If it’s works for me it would great help for me…
Siva: I've added new instructions for non-programmers that should hopefully help. Look back at the main article, possibly pressing 'Refresh' on your browser, and you should see these instructions.
Hi Matthew V Ball, Thanks for your great, great help I am looking for this change from so many years. I also tried in the way of keyboard keys power supply changes which was not a great IDEA. I need one more facility in Windows 7. I need every NEW FOLDER WITH NOTE PAD in single click. I strongly believe you are the correct person to do that. If you do this that would be great help for me.
Siva: Unfortunately, I never used Windows 7, and won't be able to help in that regard.
OK, to save anyone else the hours of pain I've just endured trying to get this working, here's a little tip.
I'm a total Mac newbie, so you'll have to forgive me my ignorance here...
I'd tried time and time again to get this working and the DefaultKeyBinding.dict file I'd created simply wasn't being picked up. No shortcuts were working, even ludicrous ones like mapping letters to other letters.
The cause? The file I'd created using TextEdit had an invisible .txt extension on it. *facepalm*
I only realised this after I downloaded the KeyBindingsEditor utility () and it created the correct file for me, showing up the other file with the txt extension.
Thinking about it now, I'm not surprised that OS X is hiding extensions, it's what Windows does by default too and I turned that off loooong ago :-) But what got me is that I had no idea that TextEdit would add its own extension if you'd specified one in the save dialog. Perhaps the instructions above can be modified to warn for this?
Well you live and learn. I hope this helps anyone else who runs into a brick wall on this!
Nathan: Interesting point! I typically run in a mode where all the extensions are always shown, so I didn't notice the feature where TextEdit can silently append a .txt. I'll update the blog to mention this.
Serenity Now! Just switched from 16 years of Windows to Mac and was going crazy. On top of just normal Mac usage, I use Citrix for work so I would have to use Ctrl-C in Citrix windows, then Command-C in my local Office apps....driving me crazy.
I swapped the Ctrl and Command keys and used your key binding file...it's like being stranded in the desert and coming upon a cooler full of Sierra Nevada. Thanks!
Now to figure out that Alt-Tab dilemma....
I couldn't even do it with as simple as "b" = ("insertText:", "a");
logged out, restarted, nada.
I don't know all the possible problems, but you might check whether the whole thing is enclosed with curly brackets and whether the filename is in the exact correct location with the correct name: ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
The ~ is the location of your home directory (e.g., /Users/myusername)
I don't know off-hand whether you can remap unshifted keys like "b". You may need to at least add a @ or something. Maybe try:
{ "@b" = "insertText:"; }
Thanks for this article.. very helpful. Just wanted to chime in about text editors that respect these bindings. I was disappointed to find that editors like TextWrangler, TextMate, and gedit (for Mac) do not respect these custom key bindings for keyboard text navigation. They mostly just use the Mac defaults, giving some limited options for changing a couple actions. The Mac built-in TextEdit does respect the bindings, which is nice, but I wanted something with syntax highlighting etc. Fortunately I found a free editor -- Fraise -- that does respect the key bindings and also has syntax highlighting and other features. Has anyone else found good text editors / IDEs that respect these key bindings for text navigation?

Curse of the Krokodil – Russian Homemade Heroin that Eats Junkies
All I can ask is WHY? The photos bellow will figuratively turn your stomach.
There’s a super bleak story in The Independent about a home-made heroin substitute that’s becoming popular in Russia. The problem is that “Krokodil” is so detrimental to the human body that it practically eats right through it.
Dubbed ‘the drug that eats junkies,’ Krokodil is a street version of desomorphine, an opiate that’s 3 times more powerful and 10 times cheaper than heroin. It’s named so because regular users develop gangrenous, scaly skin resembling that of a crocodile… it rots from the inside, causing such severe damage to tissue that users suffer from gangrenous sores which open all the way to the bone (as seen bellow).
The condition can lead to limbs being amputated, but life expectancy for addicts is at the most two to three years, with the majority dying within a year.
Extraordinarily, around 1.2 million Russians are believed to have been ravaged by the narcotic, which can be easily produced for a fraction of the price of smack. At just $6 (£4) per injection it is a much cheaper alternative to heroin, especially in Russia where the painkillers are available without prescription.
Even hardcore methfreaks are better off than Krokodil addicts. Withdrawal from the drug can take an agonizing month (Heroin detox lasts a week to ten days, a relative walk in the park).
Kids… Stick to stuff that grows out of the ground, please!
Say NO to DRUGS!!! WTF
Friends, you MUST check this out! Truly unbelievable.
This is VERY sad.
this is wrong and everyone should say no to any drug . BECAUSE U NEVER KNOW WHAT IS IN IT AND IT COULD BE DEADLY AND KILL U . life is to short as it is we are not promised tommorrow .every day is a gift not a given .SO HAVE FAITH AND BELIEVE AND TRUST JESUS.god bless everyone
Well said.
You want me to inject god instead?
If it was possible….yes!
This is not possible
dirty little bagheads need to wipe em out

"I'm in what I think is an unusual situation. My first book was published by a small-but-respected publisher who subsequently ceased trading. [Gah.] My second book was - via an agent (which I didn't have for the first) - published in a foreign country, translated into their language. Said country are not into making a big fuss of "first time" authors (apparently my first book doesn't count), so it has been rather non-eventish for me. [Not sure if this is a line you've been spun - on the other hand, actually, most books are non-eventish and it's all somewhat in the eye of the writer]. No author publicity, no big marketing bucks, and sadly the book hasn't made much of an impact. No reviews apart from two critical Amazon reviews: a one-star and a three-star. Personally I think it was a bad translation (I happen to speak the language concerned) and was pitched at entirely the wrong market. But then I would say that. [You could be right, though. And bad luck with the Amazon reviewers, who may or may not have been drunk at 3am when they wrote those reviews.]This all raises several points, as well as a few tears, and I asked BS if I could use her story to highlight a few things. She agreed.
"Unfortunately, at around the time the foreign book was published, I lost my agent. You'll just have to believe me when I say it wasn't my fault, [I do - though I'd give the anonymous agent the benefit of the doubt by saying that there are often one and a half sides to the story] as it wouldn't be professional to go into details. Whether they would ever have managed to sell the book into other territories is questionable, but we'll never know now.
"So here I am, my baby is out there but unreadable in its native tongue, and no agent will touch it with a barge pole cos it has already been flogged to death by the original agent. I - egotistic author that I am - am in a massive sulk about the fact that nobody I care about can read the damn thing, and the holy grail of publication hasn't involved a single piece of ego-stroking or validation, and it feels as though it may as well not have happened. [Ugh, this is painful.]
"Indeed, I'm so depressed that I've given up writing altogether. Abandoned the third novel in first draft stage and embarked on a new career.
"Don't worry - I'm not expecting you to tell me I did the right thing by giving up. It clearly shows a lack of backbone and an excessive degree of childish sulk, the kind which would preclude a successful publishing career. [I disagree most strongly.]
"Actually I don't know what my question is. I think it was going to be something along the lines of, "Do you think sometimes a writer just has to admit they are a bit crap, and give up?" [I will answer this.] which is only the aforementioned sulkiness in a very thin disguise... or maybe, "Don't you agree that I've had a particularly raw deal? [possibly but not certainly].You feel sorry for me, right?" - which would be more of the same...
"Obviously what I need to do is either (a) keep going and make each book better than the last, or (b) stop worrying about publication - just write for the sake of it, or (c) acknowledge that I've been writing for the wrong reasons, and have a break until I can think of some better reasons to keep doing it. But stop with all the whingeing.[can you do b) ??? If you can, then you should, anyone should, but if you can't.... a) is what we should all do if we believe in ourselves. Hmmm re c) - HAVE you been writing for the wrong reasons? What ARE the wrong reasons? But I'm not interested in your reasons and nor are your readers - we only want to know if you're good enough.]
"Hmmm. Thank you. That helped. [Er, really?!]
"Oh! I thought of a question! Here it is:
"Have you come across this phenomenon before? Writers who have a book which is only ever published in one other country, translated, and with no fanfare or success? [Frankly, I haven't come across this. But it may happen. I don't think it's the central issue. The central issue is that you came close - more than that, you were published, but it didn't deliver success. We think that success is being published - it's not.] Do they get sulky about it too, or am I just outrageously ungrateful? [Oh, trust me: we are all ungrateful because we are not megastars!] So far I'm the only writer I know who has experienced this thing."
I asked BS a few more questions but I specifically did not want to know her real name or the name of her books. Because, just for now, I don't want to read her writing - despite the fact that it's whether her writing is any good that's the most important question.
I asked what genre she wrote in, because whether it's lit fic or not makes a difference, or whether it's a genre that's easy to sell.
"Genre: That's part of my problem. I've tried to write to a genre, but it just doesn't seem to be something I can do without losing my own identity in what I write. "Contemporary fiction" is the laziest description. [No, it's a good description if it's the right one.] My second was described as a comic thriller, which is vaguely accurate. My first had large dollops of suspense. The second was published in an imprint devoted to "urban fiction". Both can definitely be described as quirky. My third is definitely a comic thriller. They're all for adults."BS lives in the UK but her second novel was published by a large publisher in Germany. Also, if you'd like more details - and it's a moving story - she's written about it here.
OK, here's what I think, apart from my italicised comments above.
- BS is serious about her writing, as she should be. The fact that she crosses genres tells me so - she just loves to write and is doing it from the heart; plus the fact that she's angsting so much about whether she's good enough. She's not a whinger; she doesn't sound deluded. She got published. From then on she was unlucky, on many counts. Now, her book(s) also may not have been fabulous - we don't know. But she got published and what happened then does not sound like her fault. (Unless she's spinning a complex tale and is in fact deluded...)
- Stuff happens: books are published badly; some agents and publishers are rubbish (hers may not have been but some are and you won't care when you sign the contract - you'll only care when "stuff happens".
- The Amazon reviews hurt. They may be right or they may be wrong. Personally, I think most Amazon reviews, even the positive ones, are suspect and I generally wouldn't trust them. But, when you get publshed you have to take them; you also have to take the fact that they can destroy you.
- listen to this: "the holy grail of publication hasn't involved a single piece of ego-stroking or validation, and it feels as though it may as well not have happened." Publication is often not the way to eternal happiness. You are all embarking on a journey which will contain many hours of heartache. Most of which no one else will ever see. Thank God. Beleaguered Squirrel has been movingly open about it. If you knew what screws me up at night you'd be surprised - I am often a mess of angst and failure.
- BS is so depressed that she gave up writing altogether. OK, that's awful but I hope it's not true. And in fact we know it's not, don't we? We know that BS will pull herself together and get back on the horse. I twice gave up writing during my 21 years of failure - or I said I was giving up. I was giving up outwardly. But I never really gave up. You can't. Not if you're a real writer. I don't know if she's good enough to get further than she already has - but gosh, I hope she is.
In fact, suddenly I really want to read it.
Why have I posted this? Why have I revealed the terrible heartache of the long-distance writer? Because you need to know. You need to know how good you have to be, how much you have to want it, and how even when you get it it may not be enough. In fact, if you're any good and if you want it so much, it probably won't be enough. Wanting more, being hungry, being greedy for success, being grasping and dementedly desperate are the things that will screw you up and carry you through. They will bring you heartsong and success and they will hurt you in the process.
That's the horrible paradox of writing.

Okay, here's my story. Shorter than the unfortunately-tagged 'BS', but misery loves company.
I'd published a bunch of nonfiction books, but wanted to write fiction. So I started writing novels, and nothing sold. Then nothing sold and nothing sold and I got an agent and nothing sold. Insert the passage of many years.
Then I got an offer on a novel. A big offer. A six-figure offer. The novel was published in the US, Germany, France, the UK, and Holland. The publisher pushed the book. They spent money on marketing. They did everything you dream of a publisher doing.
The novel tanked.
I got this wonderful ego-stroking validation--for a while. But at the end of the day, I was given that one amazing shot that every writer dreams of ... and readers simply didn't like my book.
BS: You've had two books published, but you haven't had the chance to break out. You seem inclined to conclude that you're crap, but if you're really crap, then the small-but-reputable house wouldn't have published you and the agent (if also reputable) wouldn't have repped you, and the Germans wouldn't have translated you.
Writers control almost nothing in the publishing process except the words on the page. Everything else is bullshit. Foreign sales are bullshit and reviews are bullshit and self-promotion is bullshit and Bookscan is bullshit and advances are bullshit. Hell, even readers are bullshit.
We're writers. We write. Sometimes we get a break. Sometimes we don't. Sometimes we get a big break and still go down in flames. Nothing we can do about that. Just keep writing.
Proe
Nicola, if I say how much I love you and your blog and your commenters and everyone's wisdom, will I appear as a gushing fool? Okay, I won't then, just in case.
I read about Beleaguered Squirrel's tale awhile back on another blog and FELT something about what it all meant but then moved on. You have outlined so thoroughly what it all means. Also, Prue's story shows the truth of the matter-- that the writer unpublished sees publication and that first contract as the happiest event imaginable. And then reality sets it. Much like marriage. But we just have to move on don't we? And keep working at it. To coin a trite phrase--nothing worth having comes easy. Sometimes we have to eat dirt.
Dear Beleagured Squirrel,
"Writing is a life sentence" (Richard Hughes). You have to keep writing, keep writing, keep writing.
It is not a nice occupation. It is lonely. It is difficult. You are stuck with it.
I sometimes think it would be nice to just read books and never try to write one. It is unfair that it takes an author much longer to write one than it does for me to read one.
I will not chase you up a tree Beleagured Squirrel (Ms Morgan would ban me from her blog if I did that - and who could blame her) but I will say that the only answer is to keep hoarding your nuts and then share them out with the right squirrels when the time comes. There will be squirrels who appreciate this!
Many thanks for this story, Nicola. I have followed 'BS' in her various blogs for several years and have a copy of the foreign language book (which I can't read because of the language).
I'll have to come back this evening and read the post properly, since I need to go to work.
Proe - that's a tough story. Yet here you still are, still writing and proving the truth of your last paragraph. (I'd rather ignore the penultimate one - even though on the darker days it feels true. I did meet some very uncrap readers yesterday.)
Karen - all gushing fools most welcome!
Catdownunder - indeed!
Pierre - thanks for calling by - have a good day at work!
You have my sympathy, BS, and my strongest encouragement. Well, as strong as it can be over the internet.
I hope you find the drive to write a fourth novel, informed by all that's happened to you (or at least to give your third a chance).
I can't tell you how much BS's story chimes with me. I, like most bright-eyed and bushy-tailed 'new' writers, initially set myself the goal. Mine was that I would have a novel published and piled high in bookshops by the time I was 45--amended to 50, 55--it's now 60. I'm oh so near that moment--and yet so far away. And when it happens--if it happens--I now know that that the 'big splash' I'd once imagined will be as insignificant as a grain of sugar slipped into a coffee cup. Who'll notice? And even more importantly, who will care?
Is my writing good enough to be published? Dunno. But I know it's better than some and a lot worse than others.
That's writing. Sometimes it sucks. Sometimes it sings. We keep writing.
Well said Sally Zigmond! I feel enormous sympathy for BS and know half a dozen true variations on her theme. But I also know people in IT and distribution - to my mind dull-as-ditchwater jobs that deserve recompense who are working unpaid and have for a couple of years to try and keep the companies that 'employ' them afloat.
I think it can help to see writing in two apparently disparate but actually harmonious lights. 1) It's a job - keep doing it, like waitresses still serve at table on quiet nights or teachers still teach when they have mean munchkins in their class one year - i.e. just ride with the bad times they happen in all professions, and 2) simultaneously treat it as a hobby - something we do for love. Beats watching Come Dine With Me on a wintry night; cheaper than flyfishing or jujitsu classes. Do it for the love of it, keep on doing it after a certain project has tanked, but only if we want to. If that attitude can satisfy us, then we can keep going. If not, no shame in doing something else.
Haven't written a book yet, but as Nicola says, stuff happens. And stuff that is out of one's hands. The only thing that writers can control is the writing.
BS shouldn't think of this as failures, per se, it is just the journey. So two or three or however many other books don't "make" it. I can't recall the name, but a U.S. writer finally got his first book noticed, which had received a very modest & uneventful printing years after three other books became bestsellers.
So, BS, take option A. Keep going. You're a writer. And writers write. Good luck!
Hell, even readers are bullshit.
Aiyeeee! I hope you don't mind if I take great exception to that. Without our wonderful readers, I'd probably be standing on a corner wearing a sandwich board that says, "Will edit your book for food."
As for BS's story, it tears at the heart, doesn't it? At the end of the day, each of us has to decide what defines us. Do the stories burn in our souls and scream to get out? Some of us fight that urge by getting fit for a straight-jacket. The rest write.
I have read the post on squirrel's blog along with this and what worries me is that I get the feeling that she has taken on a job which leaves her with no time at all to write on the rebound so to speak. I am concerned that she may regret not having time to write in the future. I'm sure that writing is in her bones if she has taken it as far as she has and I hope she finds some time to get back to it in the future. Best of luck for the future Squirrel. Sorry I've had to post anonymously as my google account is playing up. Gwen
Thanks so much for posting this. My first book came out through a small but award-winning publisher too, and although the initial 'buzz' and reviews were great, it basically sank without a trace. I too lost my agent (she left the business) and tried to sell a stand-alone sequel elsewhere myself before deciding reluctantly to shelve it and write something new. I now have a new agent who is shopping the book. I write because I love it and I'm not really happy unless I'm doing it, and I refuse to stop because of anything that might happen out there in the publishing world, which is probably outside my control anyway. It's a leap of faith to some extent to put your work out there, let it go, and start again at the beginning, but that's what you must do.
Perseverance is key. And a mulish stubbornness doesn't hurt either.
Behlerblog:
Well, you're a publisher, right? It's your job to think about readers. If you didn't, we'd all be screwed. That's why your cut of every book sold is larger than mine, even though I wrote the thing.
As a writer I face different hurdles. I need to summon the courage to splash myself all over the page, even though I know some people are gonna hate every word (witness the one-star Amazon review), and others won't understand a single paragraph. I need to summon the courage to keep writing even after my book tanks, or is published only in German--after my agent is hit by a bus and my publisher goes bankrupt and my spouse starts leaving the Help Wanted pages open on the kitchen table.
What's that AA prayer? 'Give me the strength to accept the things I can't change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.'
Writers can't make readers like our stuff. We try, of course, but that's ultimately not something we control. All we control is the ability to get our ass in the chair and write.
I love basketball players who work for children's charities and sign endless autographs, but those things are not the measure of the athlete: the measure of the athlete is stepping onto the field and leaving nothing behind.
One of the things I say too often is that publishing is high-stakes gambling.
It may not be very comforting, but the best thing I can offer, after 18 years in this business, is that you NEVER know when the next book will be the one that hits the jackpot.
And from my own experience, I can tell you that no one, not even the editors who are famous for picking winners, or the publicists who are known to have the Midas touch, NO ONE can put out winning books every time, nor can anyone break out the deserving books every time.
That's just one more of the things that make this business addictive.
BS, and the other commenters, you need to hold fast to the truth that you're writing the best books you can, and that you're doing as much to help your publishers sell them as you can.
Thank you all for being so sympathetic. In many ways I don't deserve it, because I've always known that this industry was hard. I've always known that most writers remain in obscurity, never make a living out of it. I've always known the drawbacks (bad reviews, no publicity, poorly pitched books, long wait times, lack of control and all the rest). And I've had more luck than many.
It's true that I've made it difficult for myself to write for the next two or three years. But I'll be busy, so it'll pass quickly. And I'm only 40. My grandparents are in their 90s. There's plenty of time. I'll write again. And maybe one day I'll produce something really, unarguably, compellingly... good. Because that is the holy grail, and it's one which is hard to stop pursuing.
My work so far has been immature, flawed, good in parts but not good overall. The flaws are fixable, in time and with experience. Give me another twenty years, another ten books, another x-thousand temper tantrums and handfuls of lost hair... and maybe I'll... Succeed? Finish? Arrive? Of course not. It's one of those damned journeys with no end.
I'll just have to admire the view.
P.S. I guess the "wrong" reasons would be money and fame. The biggest wrong reasons, I think, is money. The irony is that I was never one of those people who saw publication as route to wealth. I've never wanted to be rich anyway. But I did try and make a living out of it, and I think that killed it. For me, at any rate.
Just remember, guys: God does not play dice. Sure, there is luck in publishing and timing, but eventually your determination and inner strength is what makes it happen. You just can't give up if it's something you love. It may not happen in our timing, but it will happen if we're stubborn enough and constantly strive to improve.
On a side note, this post made me realize why a lot of the great writers were alcoholics ;).
Best of luck to you, BS!
Following various blogs & forums re writing, agents, publishing, query letters, etc., it struck me how many folks seem to make publication the be-all/end-all, expecting, if not wealth/fame, at least a living from their writing.
I suspect that if you went to Borders or B&N (or the UK equivalent) and wrote down the names of 100 fiction authors found only on the shelves (as opposed to the hard-sell tables in front), then researched them, you would find a lot of them don't make a living at it (or live damn frugally).
I write because I enjoy it, including a lot of poetry - and who was the last poet you knew making a living from his/her published poetry?
I just want to make each book as good as I can make it. If I make a buck, fine. If not, that's okay, too.
Great post and I really wish BS all the best. The whole story sounds like it would be crushing and I can fully understand why sometone would need to take some time out.
Anyway sending general cyber good luck to you all
Kate xxx
steeleweed, the poet comparison is a good one. The silly thing is I never thought a living from writing was very likely, and if I hadn't been made redundant would never have been contemplating it as this stage in my writing career. But the redundancy payment provided a cushion, and there was nothing else I felt like doing with my life. I fell into it, really, but if nothing else I hope my tale shows that people should think very hard indeed before trying to make a living out of writing. If you attempt it when you're not ready, it can really batter your confidence.
Breaks can be good, I think. Sometimes I just can't settle to writing, for no real reason - or so I think at the time. While I'm taking a break from it, doing other stuff, it often hits me suddenly that the scene I've been working on is all wrong, or there's some big problem with the plot. It's as if my subconscious has spotted the problem and found ways to stop me writing until my conscious catches up and sorts it out.
Maybe you're experiencing a similar thing, Squirrel. Regardless of your struggles with publishers etc., it sounds as if YOU are not happy with your work to date (although I think many writers can say the same!) - maybe a break is just what you need to reassess the direction you want to take with your writing.
You have my full sympathies, Squirrel, and my full hopes that you will write again when you feel ready for it. Sometimes a break is a good thing, and the time will come around again to a point where you have another story to tell. Lots of luck.
The main reason I started writing was that I had a story I wanted to tell. Over the years this mutated into a story to save me, get me out of the mire and into the sort of life I always wanted - a place of my own, a garden, somewhere safe and nice. This was far too much pressure and my writing crumbled. I took a break, work took over. And then I started writing for the fun of it again. Magazines here, online there. And suddenly I had a story to tell once again - yet my situation hasn't changed - I still want a place of my own, a garden, somewhere safe and nice. But that is no longer the reason I write. Maybe it is the rite of passage - like teenager to adult - it takes a while to settle down and realise what is important. I like creating stories. That's all.
That's why your cut of every book sold is larger than mine, even though I wrote the thing.
Anon, you always have the choice of self publishing your book and keeping all the earnings for yourself. But what you'll find is that your personal fortune will rapidly disappear as you work to get your book into the libraries and on store shelves.
You'll have to foot the bill for print runs, editing, distribution, sending ARCs to reviewers, media kits, page layout, interior and cover design, advertising, promotion, the list goes on and on.
After all that, at the end of the day, your book will more than likely create little notice, and that's because you would be a very small voice in a very competitive industry that thrives on name recognition.
Believe me, we don't sit on our posteriors eating chocolate and margaritas. It takes a lot of money to propel an author's book, and after all that expense, our take is also quite small.
I think the real issue for many writers, and not just for the person who situation is dealt with in this post, is keeping on top of the businss side of the publishing process.
If you have an agent, he or she is working for you. (Agent: one who acts for another in business.) If you are working with a publisher, you are entering into a business relationship with an organisation.
Maybe this writer needs some (more) support with the business side of the process. For example, I always have my contracts checked by a third party. The Society of Authors does this very well.
I also think about what could go wrong, and do I really want to work with these people, before I sign a contract.
Getting published is part of what we all want, but making money, building a personal brand and the right sort of reputation are all important aspects of the process, too.
It's hard, but sometimes it's better to turn down a publishing deal than to go into something that doesn't feel right.
I know I've walked away from a few offers and haven't regretted it.
For what it's worth, you know you're a writer if, whether having sworn to give it up or not, in the wee small hours of the morning a plot idea or a narrative description comes to you and prevents you from dropping off to sleep. If you get up to start noting these intrusive thoughts down, then you are still a writer 24-7. If you roll over and sink your head beneath the pillow, then maybe, just maybe, you will be able to give it up. I have been an insomniac for 20 years now on the above model.
The only forces working against this are 1) Banging your head agaainst a brick wall (to wit, the publishing industry)does yield concussion and at some point you may reel away for a lie down
2) There is alway an existential crisis provoked everytime one gazes up from one's writing desk to see unrequited MS after unrequited MS gathering dust on the shelf above your head.
These two counter-forces periodically interdict the writing drive, but never enough to hole it beneath the plimsoll line.
I'm self-pubbing for the first time. If it leads to no rungs further up the publishing ladder, I will probably just publish my other 3 novels in full for free, on Smashwords and Bookbuzzr. And then get back to my WIP with the same intention for that when it's finished. In the end, I just want my words to be read. (The Bookbuzzr sample of self-pub'd one has had 650 hits, which is more than I've had from posting to various online writing communities). How many sales will emerge from that? Who knows. Getting paid a token for them is irrelevant. It's about getting my words to the reader, by any means necessary.
Good lord, behlerblog, I never said that publishers didn't sit around eating bonbons. I didn't say publishers don't deserve the larger cut of the gross; they do.
But they reason they do is because they 'foot the bill for print runs, editing, distribution, sending ARCs to reviewers, media kits, page layout, interior and cover design, advertising, promotion, the list goes on and on.'
That's their job. That's why they get a bigger slice. They care about reviews and readers and everything else. That's great. Someone needs to.
Good lord, behlerblog, I never said that publishers didn't sit around eating bonbons. I didn't say publishers don't deserve the larger cut of the gross; they do.
Sorry, Anon. I must have misunderstood your original remark of "publishers get more, event though I wrote it." It sounded as though you found the publisher/author arrangement unfair, and I wanted to clarify.
Sorry, Nicola, didn't mean to veer this important thread off course.
I sympathise with Beleaguered Squirrel. But it's true, writing is tough. And who knows what success really is? Think of John Keats, dying at 25, not knowing if, as he hoped, he would be counted 'among the English poets' after his death, and who asked to have written on his grave merely: 'Here lies one whose name was writ in water.'
Never fear, behlerblog, Nicola knows exactly who's responsible for thread-veering!
(And sorry if I got a little prickly. I've repeatedly insisted on this blog that I'm by nature a bit of a jerk, but I -do- try not to prove it too often.)
Proe
V sorry, everyone - have been horribly tied up with stuff, none of which was proper writing.
To Proe: awww, you know yourself so well, you curmudgeonly old so-and-so! And I should have warned Lynn of the bblog about your grumpy habits... Lynn - if proe can find something to stir us up about, he will. But I think he's mellowing - gosh there was a time when he rivalled me for crabbititude.
Others - lots of wisdom there for the beleaguered squirrel. Thank you all so much.
I love the Squirrel dearly and know that this stage too is part of her journey. We all have our tales to tell and she has articulated a personal story that resonates with many other writers (inc me!).
Meanwhile, something very good has come for me personally from this post. I was feeling swamped with Real Life and getting bogged down and stressed. Reading this, the obvious solution hit me. So obvious but ...
So now I'm off to give my WIP some well-deserved space. I always feel better when I'm immersed in fiction world, which is one of the better reasons for writing. Maybe the only one that counts ...
Thanks for reminding me!
Hello Beleaguered Squirrel, it's nice to see you here despite the sad tale. I hope you'll decide to continue writing and have more inner strength unlike the quitters such as myself. The fact that you're published indicates to me that you have the ability. I think you've just been very unlucky and I hope that changes.
Nicola, thank you for posting this. I already know Squirrel and this story from another forum but it was useful, though saddening, to read it again. Readers and writers need to be aware that the art/craft/science/industry of writing can be unforgiving. Success stories such as JKR's are the exception rather than the norm.
All too often we hear from the authors who have made it, albeit usually with a struggle. We hardly ever hear about the ones who gave up or who were forced to give up. Why would we? They're useful stories though, as the give us a balance and often a much-needed reality check.
Good blog posting thanks for given this information.

Hands of the King: 29. Foundation
Denethor sat on the bench at the end of the battlement while the sun set, but for once he did not stare east across the plain. He sat and watched the Tower, and wondered how he could get past the locked door to the upper chambers. The Steward held the key to the lower door just as he himself held the key to the topmost chamber, now strung on the mariner's lanyard around his neck. One day, while walking with Ecthelion and discussing water rights on the upper Cirith, Hathol, the Warden of the Keys, approached and requested something from one of the storerooms in the Tower. The Steward very grandly led them to the arch and unlocked the new door. Denethor offered to assist Hathol with his burden, and was able to ask about the new door, once out the Steward's earshot. The key warden grumbled greatly at new locks and no key for himself and how was he to do the Tower's business if he had always to go bothering the Lord Steward? After he rejoined Ecthelion, Denethor was careful to make no mention of the new door, which only amused the Steward more.
A half-dozen plans for obtaining the key had been considered and abandoned, and now there was no time. He would soon need to leave to travel to Edoras for the marriage of Prince Théoden, and before that he had to go to Osgiliath for an inspection. Anórien, Cair Andros, and Henneth Annûn would receive their inspections after he returned from Rohan. It would be mid-July at the soonest before he would be back in the City. With a sigh, Denethor stood and returned to the Stewards House. It was in disarray, with Aiavalë's work crew busily poking into every corner and mussing every room. To take advantage of his absence, they were to work first on his apartments. Denethor had taken Aiavalë's old rooms on the ground floor, refusing her invitation to stay with her at the widow's house. Only his desk, bed, and chest of drawers had been moved – all else he locked away in a small warehouse at the back of the Citadel.
Imrahil and Beregar greeted him cheerfully when he came into the sitting room. Supper was laid out for the three of them on his desk. As long as there were no guests, Denethor insisted that Beregar would eat with himself and Imrahil, though Beregar insisted just as stubbornly that he would serve them and clean up afterwards. It seemed a small enough bit of dignity to leave the young man, so Denethor assented. As they ate, Denethor decided it would be best to go to Osgiliath at once and also to depart for Rohan as soon as could be arranged.
'Hound?'
'Yes, my lord?'
'I will go to Osgiliath tomorrow, and will remain at least one night. On the second day after I return, we will set out for Rohan. I will have letters to give to Lord Brandir so he will know to be ready.' As soon as Denethor had learned that Maiaberiel was not going to make the trip, he had decided that he would take both Imrahil and Beregar along.
'Yes, sir.' The youths exchanged pleased looks. They were almost inseparable now. Aside from the afternoons when Denethor made Imrahil attend councils or be his clerk, the two did everything together – arms training, running errands, getting into small mischief. Denethor dismissed them for the evening, and retreated to his bed chamber to read Finduilas's latest letter.
There were so many letters from Alquallë that he could no longer keep them all tucked into her book. He sat tailor-style on his bed, looking at the stack. The older ones were beginning to fall apart from being opened and refolded. The recent letters were longer and less formal, which said to Denethor that Adrahil probably was not reading them anymore, though it seemed likely that Luinil would. He picked up the one that had been delivered that morning.
Dearest Friend,
It gladdens my heart to know that you and all those whom I love in Minas Tirith are well.
I have little news to tell. A storm came through two days past and the kitchen gardens took some harm. It is early enough that more may be planted. But what a storm it was! Grandfather and I stood out on a balcony when it first approached and delighted in its ferocity. We ran inside fast enough when the rain hit. Thunder rolled like drums and the wind churned the harbor water into froth. A few ships will need repairs, as will some roofs in the town.
Please thank my little brother for his letters; they are making it easier to bear his absence. Mother was relieved to hear that you will not permit him near any of the eastern garrisons. I think she wishes to see Imrahil as soon as she can, though she does not say so.
I send my love to all there, but most of all to you, Friend.
Your beloved,
Finduilas
He reread this letter twice before sighing and tucking it into the book. The very oldest, those beginning to disintegrate, he took to the desk in the outer room. There he wrapped them inside a sheet of paper and carefully sealed the packet shut. They went into the compartment below the false bottom in one of the drawers. A persistent thief could find them, but a casual snoop would not.
***
Denethor set out not long after the second bell and took his time riding across the Pelennor. It was the first time he had come to the garrison since turning it over to Thorongil. As he neared the causeway to the fortress gate, he felt a tightness in his chest. He wondered what he would find and how he would be received. The sentries called out that the Warden approached, swiftly followed by the creak of the gates as they were opened for him. For the first time since he set foot in Osgiliath as a youth, Denethor felt a stranger. Thorongil came out of the barracks followed by another man, and for one moment, Denethor thought it was Adrahil before he recognized Halmir. The Lost's shoulder-length hair had been cropped short and was almost all grey, and his face was clean-shaven.
'Warden,' Thorongil greeted him, bowing.
Halmir gave the younger man a disapproving glance, then bowed more deeply. 'Captain.'
'Gentlemen,' Denethor replied, walking past them towards the barracks. They followed him in. He was up the stairs and almost to his room when Denethor wondered if it was still his, or if another had been put into it. After a split-second pause, he bumped the door open, and tossed his saddlebags to the cot as he always did. He continued down the hall to the officer's meeting room. If someone else had been put in his old quarters, it would be corrected by the time the meeting was done. Denethor took the black chair, accepted a cup of wine from Halmir, and waited for the other two to speak.
'When do you want to inspect the garrison and when do you want to go out?' Halmir asked without preamble. The absence of hair to soften the sharp lines of his face was disconcerting.
'The garrison this afternoon. I meet with Galdor first. Tomorrow for a patrol.'
'Yes, sir, but no patrols.'
'You have none going out tomorrow?'
The Lost hesitated for one second. 'None you will be part of.'
'Indeed?' Denethor allowed himself to sound amused at Halmir's stubbornness. 'Then you shall not go on one, either.' Halmir nodded. Denethor let his eyes move to Thorongil, waiting for the other to begin.
'How fares the south?' the captain asked.
'Well. The winter was mild compared to last year, and all signs point to a peaceful summer, at least as far as Harad and Umbar are concerned.' Placing Lark as the Archivist of Pelargir had been a good decision. Marach sent regular reports from his trade network and they arrived safely tucked in with ordinary correspondence between the Archivists. Denethor made certain that Morwen continued to receive payments for the information – he preferred to stay in her good graces. Evidently she had sent Lark's mother south to be the Matron of a new whorehouse in Pelargir. 'What of here?'
'Many fewer patrols and incursions. Birds are nesting, not just flying through,' Thorongil replied, Halmir nodding in agreement.
'Good.' Denethor drained his cup and stood. 'I will be with Galdor.' He found the surgeon in his miniscule apothecary concocting something that turned out to be passably good brandy. He ended up having dinner with the healer and spoke of the strange plants he had seen while traveling in the south. Galdor complained in equal measure about the stupidity of young men and the absence of whores. The surgeon noted that there had been almost no fumes from the Vale since just after the battles of mid-winter. Denethor thanked him for his company and assured Galdor that he would be invited to the wedding. He then set out to inspect the fortress.
Nothing had changed. That was the greatest surprise. The garrison was just as he had left it. It looked the same, smelled the same, sounded the same. It was only when they climbed the walls and looked out at the ruins that Denethor found difference. Even across the river, he could make out scorch marks on the stone, could see gaps where previously something had been. As soon as he could, he left the wall. When the three were back in the courtyard, Denethor asked Thorongil, 'How far out do we command?'
'To the Crossroads. We patrol beyond it, but I wouldn't say we command it.'
'We'll go that far tomorrow, then, and a ways north.' Halmir looked displeased, but said nothing.
'You will stay two nights, sir?' Thorongil asked.
'Yes. If you will excuse me.' With a nod, Denethor dismissed the officers and headed back towards the barracks. He wanted to look again on the ruins, but did not want to be accompanied while he did. Passing through the barracks, he slipped in between the outer wall and a row of storehouses. There was a little-used stair that led to a barred window overlooking the ruins – the dank corridor continued a dozen yards to another narrow stair that let out behind the privies. Denethor rested his arms on the window ledge and looked at Osgiliath. He ran his eyes slowly over the edges on the river, noting exactly where Anduin had carried away parts of the past. A breeze came from the east. In it, Denethor thought he smelled burned flesh. He made himself stay there and look until he had examined all that could be seen from the small window. Dinner had caught up with him, so he carefully picked his way along the cramped and slick passage towards the privies. The sound of two familiar voices made him stop part-way down the stair.
'No.'
'It is…'
'No.' From the sounds of the voices, Halmir and Thorongil were near the entrance to the stair, their voices amplified and echoing slightly against the stone. After a pause, Halmir continued, 'There is no reason for you to go. I can answer any questions.'
'And I am the one to answer to the Warden.' Thorongil's voice was patient. Halmir made a rude sound. 'He will expect it.'
'Not both of you over the river at once. Why can't you understand this?'
There was another long pause, accompanied by the rustle of cloth. Denethor surmised they were using their sign code. Afterwards, Thorongil said 'Very well,' though he sounded reluctant. There was more sound of cloth.
'He has business being here!' Halmir's voice was low but sharp.
'As do I.'
'You don't belong here. You…' The words ended and there was more noise of cloth, ending with the sound of a hand slapping stone. After another long pause, Halmir said, 'I do my duty. You have yet to understand yours.' The next sound was footsteps, but Denethor could not determine if both men had left. He stealthily withdrew and came out by the other stairway. Later, at supper, Denethor sat with Galdor and Thorongil and spoke about the condition of south Gondor. Halmir sat with the other four of the Lost stationed in Osgiliath. The King's Men also sat together, though they were subdued. The cot in Denethor's room was comfortingly familiar, and he got his first good night's sleep since he had been moved out of the alcove in his study.
The ride with Halmir the next day was uneventful. They and a dozen other horsemen rode over the bridge just past sunrise. They were to the Crossroads by midmorning, then rode a few leagues north on the main road before turning west and returning slowly through the small paths and overgrown lanes that crisscrossed the western slopes of Ithilien. Thorongil was right; there were more birds in the land than Denethor had heard for several springs. The blooms were gone from abandoned orchards, and green fruit hung thick on their branches. Half-demolished walls bore witness to where fields once lay, a faint memory of how Ithilien had mirrored the Pelennor and the eastern reach of Anórien, each protected by a proud tower. Every so often they would pass the remains of an old house, sometimes with a wall or chimney jutting up through brambles and wildflowers, sometimes just the burned foundations. Twice they stopped to allow a rider to dismount and give reverence to a family home. Each left a handful of waybread on the hearth and knelt in honor of what had been lost. Denethor knew each was to promise to retake their lands, but wondered if any still believed that would happen.
They were nearly back to Osgiliath when Halmir said, 'The defense of Ithilien is poorly done.'
'In what way?'
'It needs better coordination. We here know nothing of what the northern rangers do.'
'I could say the same.' Denethor looked at Halmir until the other dropped his gaze. 'Yet, somehow, it appears we are safe enough, though we are told little and are asked to take all on faith.' The Lost did not reply. 'I command Cair Andros and Osgiliath through my seconds. I know what is being done. Unless there is something here of which I am ignorant?'
'No, sir.' They rode for several minutes before Halmir asked, 'Why do you trust us?'
'Should I not?' Halmir did not answer and they rode in silence back to the garrison. Denethor wrote a note for the evening messenger to take to Beregar, telling him to be ready three days hence to set out for Rohan, then spent the rest of the day going over the ledgers and reports of the garrison. Once again, he slept well.
At breakfast Denethor told Thorongil, 'You come with me today. I inspect the ruins.' Halmir looked sourly at them both before leaving the mess. Soon, Denethor heard the gates to the bridge creak open and shut and knew extra guards had been sent out.
They began by walking the length of the bridge, Denethor inspecting it carefully. It was in acceptable condition. They left the bridge near the eastern end and entered the ruins. It was further than he remembered to the edge of the Fire's reach. At first, all he could see were scorch marks, then there were places with shattered stone. In all of the protected crevices, soot clung and stank. Denethor did not want to touch the stone, afraid of what it would say to him. Finally, when they stood amidst the center of the Fire-fall, where spidery cracks veined the stone and there was an odor of rotting things, he laid a hand upon the crumbling skeleton of an arch. It refused to weep despite its burns and breaks, grinding stone upon stone like an injured man clenching his teeth, while Anduin tried to wash away the memory of the desecration. Denethor walked on, looking for another wound. A fragment of stone came away in his hand when he touched an old window sill. One edge was sharp and he gripped the stone tightly, letting it bruise his palm. In another spot, he brushed his fingers over a scorched carving and they came away coated with an oily soot. He rubbed them on his clothes but could not remove all of the filth.
The smell increased as the sun warmed the stone. While not as strong as on the day of the battle, the stench was of the same kind. Under his feet, Denethor could feel the stone yearning to stoop down into the river's cool embrace and be cleansed. A wave of nausea came over him, forcing him to stop and lean against a wall until he overcame the impulse to retch. Thorongil touched his shoulder, tentatively at first, but more firmly when Denethor did not resist. It was like Finduilas's touch, or the mariner's, removing the turmoil in his heart and leaving a kind of peace behind. Gently, the hand pulled on him.
'We should leave this place, Denethor.'
'Yes.'
The two men picked their way out of the center of the ruins and back to the bridge. As he had in the winter, Denethor led them to the pier of stone in the midst of water. They sat in the same manner, he to the west, Thorongil to the east. Denethor could feel something different to the pier, a greater trembling before Anduin's current, and knew the stone would give way in the next few years, perhaps even in the floods of the coming spring. One of the tiles, decorated with a sun, had an exposed edge. Denethor pulled his belt knife and began chipping at the mortar under the tile.
'You're going to ruin your knife.' Denethor shrugged and kept trying to work the tile loose. 'Why did you send me that note?'
It took Denethor a moment to remember the message he had sent to the captain concerning the pyres in Umbar. 'Did you understand?' There was no one else to tell.
'I think so.' Chip, chip. 'Do you know any more?'
'No.' The pyres, they would smell like Osgiliath. When Eldacar fled, the stones also burned, and those faithful to him were burned. The city escaped into the river, casting itself into her murky depths. The corpses were drawn south by the current, even as far as Pelargir, where the rebels mocked them.
'Does the Steward know?'
'I said nothing to him of this.' The point of the knife was ruined. Ecthelion would welcome the Fire as long as it destroyed the bridge and the past.
'What is Umbar like?' Denethor looked up. Thorongil sat, knees drawn up and arms wrapped around them. 'Tell me of this place. What would I find there?'
The question was asked so honestly there was nothing Denethor could do save answer. 'It is beautiful. It sits on the hills and cliffs overlooking the firth. Below is the greatest harbor you will ever see, with many docks of stone and ships of every kind. There are no large trees anymore, though once there were cedars. Every square has a fountain. The streets are silent, for no one dares to speak. The women and even some of the men wear veils to shield their faces from the sun. The slaves are not permitted veils or much clothing, so their skin is dark. Worse than the black ships are the black hearts. Umbar is like a peach with a pit consumed by mold and rot. All that is left is the skin that holds in the putrescence.' Denethor returned to chipping the tile loose. It was almost done. 'Crime binds them together and to worse excesses, and the powerful vie to see who shall be the most wicked.'
'You believe the report?'
'Completely.' I fired an arrow into its black heart.
The captain sighed and looked into the swirling waters. 'I should see Umbar.'
'It is here, if you know where to look. Everything is here.' With a final chip, the tile was free. Denethor looked at it closely, then spat on it and rubbed it with his sleeve to clean off the grime. He slipped the tile into a pouch at his waist. 'Now, it is my turn for a question.' It was difficult not to laugh at Thorongil's wary look. 'What is the north like? Tell me of this place. What would I find there?'
'It would depend on where you went.' The captain looked down at the tiles. 'Some settlements. Not much.'
'Is there nothing left?'
Thorongil's eyes caught his own, fierce and bright. 'Hearts. Hope.' The man half-smiled, but it had no humor in it. 'Mercenaries. Little that would interest you, Warden.'
Denethor stood. 'No, Captain, I would find it all interesting. But I think most of it is already here.' He led the way back to the garrison. When they arrived, Denethor asked for Gaerhûl to be readied and went to his room to collect his pack. Thorongil waited for him in the courtyard.
'Is all to your satisfaction, Warden?'
'Yes.'
'I will see you next week when I come for council.'
'No, you won't.'
'Why not?'
'I will be in Rohan for the next month. I go to attend Prince Théoden's wedding.'
'When is that?' Thorongil asked eagerly.
'Mid-summer, I believe.'
'Would you…' The captain paused and began again in a more formal tone. 'Warden, if I write a note of congratulation to the Prince, might I entrust it to your care?'
'Of course. Send it by the evening messenger.' A stablehand brought Gaerhûl up. 'Good day, Captain.'
'Good day, sir.'
The return to the City gave Denethor a chance to think. The wilds of the north, the depravities of the south, and Gondor caught between them like the bridge that ran through the ruins of Osgiliath. Both north and south were lost and each grasped at what lay between them. Umbar was a hollowed out thing, a shell or garment wrapped around rot. It survived only as long as Gondor did, its soul the hatred it bore towards what gave it life. In this it spoke the truth of the Enemy and the greater foe who had been that one's master. The Lost, however, what to make of them? Why do I trust you? Denethor tried to name the reasons to himself; they are Dúnedain, they have always served well, we know them… No, I do not. But I trust them. They are like the northern ruins, nearly gone, but still strong. Slowly their foundations erode, and they wander more. He looked north as he rode, wishing once more for the palantír. The tiny bit Thorongil said had captured Denethor's imagination, and he wanted to ride north and see this place for himself. Hearts and hope you say, Captain. But you must live somewhere. What of these settlements? For the first time, he found himself ruing the bargain he had struck with Adrahil to move the wedding up. If he had until the summer after next, surely that would be enough time to go to the Lost realm and return? Then he would understand why these men wandered and suffered the indignity of selling themselves. That was it. Now he knew his true question. Why do you wish to wander rather than return here, to Gondor? Do you not want a home in the world? The Tower gleamed ahead of him, shining and proud in the summer day. There were foundations reaching deep into the bedrock of Gondor itself. Denethor enjoyed seeing the details of the City emerge as he rode closer. Neither the putrid hate nor the rootless hearts for you, fair Queen. You bear the burden of preserving what has been for those who are yet to be. And soon there would be a queen for Minas Tirith, a woman as beautiful and brave, as caring and kind as the City herself. Denethor urged Gaerhûl into a canter, eager to return.
***
'Denethor.' Imrahil had a conspiratorial look on his face as he sidled up. They were one day past the Anórien garrison on their way to Edoras. They should arrive at the Golden Hall on the fourth day from today.
'What is it?'
'Do you know what today is?'
'The fourteenth of June.'
Imrahil grinned, then glanced around quickly. 'It is Beregar's birthday!' That explained both the mirth and the caution. 'We must give him what celebration we can this evening.'
'Tell Brandir. He will help.' Imrahil nodded and scurried off. Denethor glanced around until he saw the Hound and whistled to get his attention.
'My lord?'
'You will ride with me today. We have a few things to discuss that are not for the young prince's ears.'
Beregar nodded soberly. 'Yes, sir.'
'I will tell Lord Brandir that he is Imrahil's companion today. He can instruct the other on Anórien.' Beregar bowed shallowly and trotted off to help ready the horses. During the ride, Denethor and Beregar spoke of the young man's arms training, any rumors or odd things Beregar had come across, and how the ordering of the Stewards House was coming along. As Beregar astutely presented the condition of the King's Men – floundering, unfocused, falling out of favor – Denethor had to take a new measure of the man. The Hound might not be a master of lore, nor clever with figures and calculations, but he understood power, much more so than Denethor had credited to him before. When they rested during midday, he watched the two young men practice their archery. Beregar's skill was impressive. I'll need to keep him away from Marlong, or the captain will demand him for Henneth Annûn. An idea came to Denethor's mind, which he liked. He settled in for a nap, looking forward to the end of the day.
They camped in a place much used by travelers along the road, with a pen for the horses and some sturdy windbreaks for the men. The soldiers set up camp in a cheerful manner, exchanging sly looks and winks. When it came time for supper, Denethor called Beregar over, face stern.
'Beregar, I am displeased.' He said this in a strong voice so all would hear.
The young man looked worried. 'At what, my lord?'
'You. You have not been truthful today.'
'Who says so?' was Beregar's indignant reply. 'I have spoken no falsehood!'
'I asked you for all that you knew and you failed to tell me one very important thing.' Denethor paused for effect. 'Is it true that today is your birthday?'
Beregar stood there with an astounded look on his face while the soldiers whooped and hooted. Imrahil and one of the younger soldiers ran up and dragged Beregar to a hastily improvised throne made with a saddle and crowned him with a daisy garland. Beregar was made to sit and accept Imrahil waiting on him for supper. He was given a pouch with a few small coins from the soldiers and a piece of silver each from Brandir and Denethor as a gift, amidst much joking that he had to start saving for a wife. The evening was merry with stories and songs performed in Beregar's honor. Denethor refused to let the young man serve him at all that evening, not even to lay out his bedroll.
'Not today, Huan. The Lady would shake a finger at us both.'
'Thank you, master.'
'You are becoming a good archer.'
Beregar smiled. 'You think so?'
'Yes. When we return to Minas Tirith, I will see that you are given a longbow and a quiver of arrows for your own.' He brushed off the other's thanks and went to bed.
***
In the afternoon of the fourth day after the celebration, the party drew near Edoras. Meduseld's golden roof shimmered in the afternoon heat. A group of horsemen, their hair shining as brightly as the hall's crown, raced out to meet them, circling like swallows and singing a welcome to the guests. Théoden led them. Quickly, the golden warriors formed an escort for the Gondorians and guided the travelers up the road to the gate that pierced the stone and wood wall, singing all the while. When they reached the gate, Théoden dismounted and bowed grandly. Denethor slipped off Gaerhûl and bowed somewhat less grandly in return.
'Welcome, Denethor, son of Ecthelion, High Warden of Gondor, and friend of the Mark! Welcome Lord Brandir, counselor and friend! Lord of the Mark, King Thengel, has sent me to greet you and to bring you as quickly as may be before him. Will you come now and enjoy the hospitality of our halls?'
'Thank you Théoden, son of Thengel, Prince of Rohan, friend of Gondor. We are honored by your greeting and ask to be presented to your lord, Thengel, King of Rohan,' Denethor replied with another shallow bow. Théoden smiled and gestured for them to follow him. As they passed through the gate, the riders sang once more, enjoining them to rest in peace and safety under the golden eaves.
Denethor looked around with great curiosity as they climbed the hill to the hall. People came out from the houses to see the guests, and many waved and called to Brandir when they recognized him. The houses clustered thickly upon the stone way and alleys built of hewn planks led to more houses built behind. None of the houses was more than a ground floor and a loft above in height. Many had carved doorways and eaves, and a few had simple images of flowers or horses stenciled on their walls. There was not a sense of disappointment seeing Edoras as there had been when he looked upon Dol Amroth, though there were a few times that Denethor wished to laugh. This is the capitol of a kingdom? He could count a dozen towns of Gondor more grand than this, and several dozen villages fully its equal. Only Meduseld itself gave nobility to this rustic outpost. He looked at the stone street they trod, and had to shake his head. It was Gondorian work, as was the watercourse that ran alongside.
The hall itself sat upon a foundation of Gondorian stone. Before the hall, six tall guards stood, silent and fair, waiting for them. Théoden hastened up the steps before the rest, then turned to stand with the guard. As one, the seven offered their swords hilt first.
'Hail, noble guests!' The man to Théoden's left sheathed his sword and stepped forward.
'I am Hárald, Doorward of Thengel. Leave here your arms, for our lord will allow no harm to come to you within his halls.'
Denethor had to admire the graceful phrasing of this law, and gave over his sword and knife. Brandir had left his sword on his horse and had only a knife to surrender. Imrahil and Beregar had no swords of their own, so presented their knives. Hárald laid the weapons carefully upon the stone before the seats and signaled for the doors to be opened. Théoden preceded them into the hall. They passed though the dim and beautifully decorated hall too quickly for Denethor's liking, for he wished to examine the carvings and tapestries. Skirting an open hearth, they approached the king. Denethor was shocked at Thengel's appearance. The last time he had seen the man was at Steward Turgon's funeral, twenty-two years before. Then Thengel had been like to his son, tall, proud, and golden, with a ready laugh and a strong back. The man before him bent forward in his throne the same way his gnarled fingers curved over the arms of the chair. Thengel looked older than Angelimir.
'Hail, Thengel, son of Fengel, Lord of the Rohirrim!' Théoden called out. 'I present to you noble guests from Mundburg.'
Thengel stood more smoothly than Denethor expected and stood almost upright. He laughed and that was the same as it had always been. 'Welcome, indeed! Two friends I see, and two new faces I must come to know so that they, too, may be counted friends.' The king descended the dais and embraced Denethor. Thengel was lean, but not frail, and there was strength still in his arms. 'Denethor, son of Ecthelion, too long has it been since we have spoken. Once I was shown the generosity of your city, and now shall I return that kindness!' Brandir stepped forward for an embrace. 'Good friend, Brandir! The Queen has said you must pay a call upon her ere the sun sets!'
'I shall do as she commands, friend Thengel,' Brandir replied. Chairs were brought and set near the foot of the dais. The king waved them to seats, taking one for himself.
'Denethor, who are these young men that you bring?' Thengel asked.
'A kinsman of your Queen, Imrahil, son of Adrahil of Dol Amroth.'
'Brother to your betrothed, yes?' Thengel said with a quick smile.
'Yes. Brother to Lady Finduilas.' The king nodded pleasantly to Imrahil, who stood and bowed. 'The second is my squire, Beregar the Hound.' Beregar mimicked Imrahil, bowing to both Thengel and Théoden. A serving woman brought forward a tray with mugs of ale for each of them. Denethor raised his mug in a toast. 'To the friendship, honor, and courage of Rohan.' They drank to this toast and several others, then settled in to talk. Nothing of great importance could be discussed in this setting, but the converse was pleasant. Thengel's wits were sharp and his speech engaging.
In no time it all, the afternoon turned to a gentle summer evening, and supper was laid in the hall. Queen Morwen arrived with her daughters, two of whom Denethor faintly remembered from the previous fall, and more greetings were exchanged. The hall filled with people who came to see the guests and honor their arrival. The dishes were plain, but the food plentiful and served with great courtesy. As the meal progressed, the guests were no longer so interesting and chatter turned to the wedding in two days. Théoden was the object of teasing and ribaldry which he cheerfully accepted.
The day's ride was beginning to take its toll upon Denethor. From their barely stifled yawns, Imrahil and Beregar were in much the same condition. Denethor glanced around the room, wondering how much longer the meal would last. Everywhere he looked, he saw happy faces, golden hair, many children.
Except over there. In one of the darker corners, an older man sat and stared at him. This man's hair was dark, as were his heavy-lidded eyes. Next to him was a tired woman with pale brown hair, shot through with grey, and she had a child in her lap. To the other side were three more children, two girls as mousy as their mother, and a lad somewhat younger than Imrahil, though Denethor realized that he probably could not determine the ages of Rohirrim by looking. They would all look older to him than they really were. He nodded politely to the dour man, who did not respond but kept staring. To Denethor's relief, the meal ended not long afterwards, and the Gondorians were guided to a small house near the hall so they could sleep. Their weapons were already there. Denethor gratefully crawled into a sleeping booth at the side of the central room.
A soft rap on the door of the booth woke him the next morning, letting him know that breakfast was there. Théoden came to the guesthouse within the hour, asking for Imrahil and Beregar. When the young men left, Denethor decided to look at Edoras. There was not much to see. The entire village could be known in less than an hour. There was no market place within it, nor any great building save Meduseld, nor even a common tavern. Behind the hall there were some low stone storehouses, made of river-rock and broken stone bound with coarse mortar. Tow-headed children followed him and women watched from their doorways. If he bowed, they would giggle and bow or curtsy in return. He walked back up the stone way, noting where the dressed stone had come loose near turns and along the edges, and how it had been repaired with simple cobbles. Denethor climbed the steps to Meduseld. One of the guards stood to give the guest a stone seat. From there, Denethor looked at the paved street snaking its way down the hill.
It is not enough to build a durable foundation. That is but the start. Then it must be tended, and with knowledge, else the repairs but cobble things together. Denethor did not understand why the Rohirrim did not ask for a stonemason to be sent to reset and bind the stones of the street. When walking around, he saw that many of the wooden planks used for the alleys were new, replacements for others that had rotted or split. There was not a way in Minas Tirith, no matter how mean, that was not paved. Where is the pride in foundation, to build something to outlast you? Already, after but one morning, Denethor found himself impatient with this place. There was contentment here and honor, even glory, but no thought to greater things.
And why should they strive, if all that is made will be unmade, and all that lives shall fail? Denethor had a fleeting memory of the vision of the towers and once more the world seemed dim. He struggled against it like a diver seeking the surface. To make is to be unmade… No. He would not succumb to the Steward's despair and wish destroyed what could not be made eternal. Even so, he felt weighed down, dragged away from the surface by a burden of thought. Denethor rose from his stone seat and returned to the cobbled road, squatting down and studying the juxtaposition of stone cut by hand and that smoothed by a river. It was easier to gather a basket of rocks and pound them into the dirt. It was something an older child could be entrusted to do. Do the Lost have even cobbled streets? Perhaps this is why they wander. There must at least be farms. It was a peculiar idea, that one might not have a home, but also an enticing one. To be able to just go…
'I knew Gondorians loved stone, but did not realize the romance was so complete.' Denethor jumped at the voice and almost fell over. Thengel stood next to him, face crinkled in amusement. 'What fascinates you so much?'
'The disrepair of the street.' Denethor stood, feeling foolish. 'There are stonemasons…'
'I know.' Thengel's humor disappeared. 'I know all there is in Minas Tirith that is not here.' The king motioned with his chin. 'Come with me. I am off to watch the young men at their practice.'
Thengel did not wait for an answer but briskly set off down the road. Denethor followed him out of Edoras to a low hill overlooking some lowlands between the road and the Snowbourn. There a number of horsemen were gathered, practicing with spear and bow, shouting insults and encouragement to each other in equal measure. Denethor could see Imrahil and Beregar in the midst of the Rohirrim, very much a part of the drills. Thengel motioned towards a large flat stone, indicating they should sit. As the king did not seem inclined to talk, Denethor watched the horsemen. Soon, he could pick out a pattern from the hurly-burly; there was an order to who followed whom, which weapons were used, even what insults were offered. Théoden kept the squad moving constantly, shifting speed and direction at a shouted command, a whistle, or an arm motion. The golden riders changed between spear and bow with grace, the two ravens among them less so. Théoden kept a close eye on his guests, skillfully guiding them in the intricate weave of attack, retreat, reform.
'Your son orders his men well. Even the new recruits.'
'He has earned it.' Thengel watched his son with pride. 'King's heir or no, he had to prove himself worthy to be First Marshal. That is his own éored, gathered from across the Riddermark and trained to his approval. It was this company that held off the orc incursion through the Wold last summer. Even with what we send to you, Rohan is not left unguarded.'
'Théoden has not commanded the Riders in Gondor.'
'Nor will he.'
'Not after the marriage, of course.'
'I do not want him to serve Gondor.' Denethor left off watching the horsemen and turned to face Thengel. The king's face was stony. 'His place is here.' Thengel's gaze returned to Théoden. 'He must not be divided. It must never occur to him that there are things to be found elsewhere.'
'You lived a long time in Gondor.'
'Twenty-four years. I would fain have stayed the rest of my life.' The old man once more looked at Denethor, his blue eyes sharp. 'Once, when I was foolish, but not so young, I dreamed of remaking this simple place into a great city, of bringing my people finally out of twilight.' He laughed, a mere bark of derision. 'I have lived another four and twenty years, and age will soon end my foolishness. I have learned to be silent on it, but it stalks my dreams and stands as a rebuke.'
The king rose and waved to the éored below. The company wheeled smoothly, even the ravens, and charged up the hillside. King and Warden found themselves surrounded. Thengel praised the horsemen and exchanged loving words with Théoden, then bade them continue. The horsemen would not leave before they sang of their king's valor and wisdom, then saluted and left in a thunder. Thengel walked back to Meduseld. Denethor followed as he had not been dismissed.
'No,' Thengel began as though their conversation had not been interrupted, 'he will lift them no higher, but there will be contentment. I also begin to wonder where our enemies will come from. The Great Enemy rises, it is true, but I am concerned about our western borders as well.'
'Curunír?'
'You mean Saruman, the wizard? Perhaps. Dunlendings most certainly. Orcs return to the mountains near the Gap.'
'Is there trouble from the wizard? Queen Morwen said she thought him unfriendly.'
'Unfriendly? Oh, yes. But I do not know if he is a threat. He does not allow Eorlingas to draw near Orthanc. He will protect Dunlendings who flee to his lands. Even so, he has offered us no harm directly.'
'Wizards perform their works out of sight.'
'Hmm.' The two passed through the gate and walked up the hill. 'Théoden will think of Rohan, but he will not forget Gondor.'
'Is that why you allowed him to come last fall?'
'Yes. He will regard Gondor with honor, but his heart will live always here and he will be a beloved king.' Softly, as though speaking to himself, Thengel said, 'Had I known such a king, I would not have known Gondor.'
'Will you not see her once more? This winter.'
'Yes, I would like that.' They continued up to Meduseld and took seats upon the terrace. Far off, they could see the éored finish its drill. 'Thank you for bringing Imrahil. It pleases Morwen to have a kinsman here. He was not doing too badly in the drills.'
'I saw.'
'Your squire is quite good as well. Better than the other boy.' Denethor waited, curious at Thengel's words. 'Would you be interested in having him remain?'
'I do not understand.'
Thengel shrugged. 'Not all wives are pleased by kinsmen.'
It was several moments before Denethor understood what Thengel was suggesting. As he could give no answer to the question, he stood and bowed to Thengel, then returned to the guesthouse. The house was empty. Denethor took a seat and pulled out the book with its letters tucked inside, laying his treasures on the table before him. It was difficult to think; now said, Denethor was amazed at his own blindness, and wondered who else had arrived at the same conclusion as Thengel. Surely, you have not, Alquallë. You know the truth. This is what Morwen meant, that I would but cause more harm with rumors. Denethor deliberately read over each letter, then read from the book. Food arrived at noontide, then again in the evening, accompanied by the others of his party and apologies from Morwen for laying no table. The wedding feast was tomorrow and the hall was being readied. That night, Denethor dreamed of Gondolin falling.
Edoras was in merry chaos the next morning and promised to remain that way until early-evening when the feast would begin. Morwen appropriated Brandir first thing to assist. Denethor sized up the situation and went to the stables to ask for Gaerhûl to be readied. Within an hour of the sun's rising, he was riding south towards Harrowdale. Beregar and Imrahil caught up with him not long afterwards and the three journeyed into the steep, narrow vale. By midmorning they had reached the wall below the mountains, with a narrow switchback road leading upwards to a high meadow, and climbed the steep way. Denethor felt a sense of wonder at the weathered carvings marking each turn in the path. They stopped at the meadow and ate some dinner, Beregar having slipped bread, cheese, and sausage from the kitchens. Far away north, Denethor could just make out the glimmer of Meduseld's roof. While the horses grazed, the men walked along the track that led between a double row of black stones. The closer they drew to a forest of dark pines, the stronger Denethor felt a sense of dread. It was akin to the sensation he experienced in the Osgiliath battles, of hatred and evil so cold it froze the soul, but this was less piercing, more like a numbing fog leaching life from a traveler's limbs. They stopped at the forest's eaves and peered into the gloom under the boughs, but even Denethor did not care to venture into the darkness, nor did he try to touch the standing stones. He contented himself with pocketing a fragment of stone that had fallen from one of the watcher statues. They collected the horses and were back to Edoras in good time to wash and dress for the feast.
Near sunset, Théoden and his bride spoke their wedding vows upon the terrace before the hall. They spoke Rohirric, not the speech of Gondor as the court usually spoke. Denethor understood most of it, though he had to concentrate. The open ground before Meduseld was packed with Rohirrim, and more filled the main street and the lanes just off the hilltop. When Théoden kissed the girl to seal their pledge, the wooden walls of Edoras reverberated with the onlookers' joyous shouts. The doors of Meduseld were thrown open and people crowded inside for the feast. More tables and benches were set up before the hall. Denethor found himself seated next to Thengel at the high table. There were many toasts, and boasts, before the food was passed and a low rumble of talk filled the room.
'I must apologize, Lord Denethor,' Thengel said cheerfully. 'I did not mean to drive my most noble guest away with the hubbub this morning.'
'I wished to view Harrowdale, which I have heard described many times, and the day seemed good for riding.'
'Good! Good!' the king replied. His voice dropped as he added, 'I beg leave for my presumption of yesterday. I fear I have insulted you.'
Denethor studied Thengel's face. The words were sincerely meant, but there was also a challenge in the other's blue gaze. 'There is no reason to leave my hound anywhere.'
'Truly?' Thengel's expression was amused and unconvinced.
'Truly.'
When all had eaten their fill, people came and went in the hall. Denethor took advantage of this to leave the high table, following the new couple outside where there was dancing. He found a dark corner where he could watch everything without being seen. Théoden and the girl held court while other young people toasted them and tossed slightly ribald compliments at them. The couple took it all in good cheer, drinking, kissing, and dancing as the crowd demanded. Now and again he spotted Beregar and Imrahil among the revelers. He had not been able to give the man much attention during the ride, but now Denethor examined Beregar's face and gestures intently. There was no denying the Hound's resemblance to the Steward's offspring, but Denethor did not know his own face well enough to say that the two of them looked enough alike to be sire and get.
'And none too soon!' Some men were standing just past Denethor, backs to him, watching Théoden and Elfhild try to drink out of a horn at the same time. One of the men was the dark-haired fellow who had stared at him the evening before. The son stood nearby and there were two others.
'Finally, we'll have a proper queen,' the dark-haired man said in a gloating tone. Denethor had to strain to understand the Rohirric speech.
'Yes, Gálmód, you have that right,' the taller of the other two men replied. 'No more arrogant women who cannot speak their lord's tongue!'
'I am not sure the lord knows his own tongue,' was Gálmód's sneering reply. 'He has too long been under the sway of foreign things.'
'Shh!' the second man entreated. Denethor drew a little further into the shadows. 'There's no call to speak so!'
'You're half ensorcelled yourself, Gram,' snapped Gálmód. 'What have we to do with such deceitful ways? We are hedged about by wizards and dwimmer-crafty women and men who think naught of spilling our blood as their own fails. We need a true king, who spends not his time always wishing he were bounded by stone.'
The tall man sharply signaled for Gálmód to be quiet, which made the other snort and stride off, his son at his heels. Gram and the tall man whispered fiercely to each other before slinking away in the other direction. Denethor wondered if Thengel knew that rebellious words were spoken openly among the townsfolk. Given his words of yesterday, he does and knows what has caused this discontent. He prepares for what is best for Rohan even as he would fain lead his people another way. Denethor was not particularly dismayed by Gálmód's words against Gondor – there were those in Gondor who resented the use of the Rohirrim – but wondered what status this man held in Edoras. Was he a tradesman, a farmer, a rider? There was not much formality as to who of the town could dine in the king's hall.
Denethor also was intrigued by the man's words about wizards. Not simply Curunír, I deem. What trouble have you been stirring up among the horsemen, Mithrandir? He had not considered that perhaps these two wizards were working in concert. It would appear that I have not given enough attention to our northern borders. A quick glance said that the carousing was not going to end soon. He trusted Beregar would keep the young prince out of any serious trouble, and returned to the hall. Thengel and Morwen sat with some others at the high table, speaking cheerfully, while a minstrel led a group of children in a clapping song about farm animals near the central hearth. Brandir, sitting next to the queen, saw Denethor and waved him over.
'There you are, Denethor,' Brandir said. 'I wondered where you had wandered to. You have been missing for most of two days.'
'I did not wish to interfere with wedding preparations.'
'An excellent decision, Warden,' Morwen interjected , 'and good practice for you. Simply say "yes" to whatever the women plan if you wish to enjoy your own wedding.'
Denethor bowed in acknowledgement of her wisdom. 'I shall hold your advice dear, Queen Morwen.'
Thengel motioned for Denethor to sit next to him and poured him a mug of ale. 'Denethor, I know that your duties are many, but will you agree to bide a while with us here in Edoras? I promise things will be quieter by tomorrow.'
'Alas, my duties demand that I depart tomorrow, or at the latest the day afterwards.'
'Nonsense, Denethor!' Brandir objected, 'There is naught so pressing in Minas Tirith that you must return at once.'
'I did not say I was returning to Gondor.'
'Where then do you go?' asked Thengel, blue eyes alight with curiosity.
'I am off to see a wizard.'
***
As it turned out, Denethor did not set out until the morning of the third day after the wedding, and he did not go alone. Thengel decided that he, too, wished to speak to Curunír, and Morwen announced she was going with them. The extra day's delay was caused by the king and queen trying to convince each other to remain in Edoras. Neither succeeded. Denethor had greater success making Beregar remain behind with Brandir and Imrahil. A half-dozen of the Gondorian soldiers attended Denethor and two dozen riders followed their king and queen. Also in attendance were four of Thengel's counselors, including Gálmód. Each counselor had several horsemen, and Gálmód had his son, no doubt so the young man could learn statecraft. The company was rounded out by a string of pack horses and a hostler.
Thengel stood, wearing no armor but with a sword on his hip, and surveyed the gathered men with a wry chuckle. 'All this to pay a call on a neighbor.' His blue eyes twinkled as he glanced at Denethor. 'We did not get a chance to ride together, Warden, when I was in Gondor. Now we shall correct that.'
'I hope there is no occasion for battle on this ride, Thengel,' Denethor replied. Ahead of them, they watched Morwen mount her horse and ride towards them. She carried a short bow and a quiver of arrows.
'Indeed not,' Thengel softly answered. Morwen reined up before them. 'Good morrow, my queen. You are determined in this foolishness?'
'As long as you are, my heart,' she answered firmly, 'I will not be parted from thee, not even if there is danger.'
Thengel sighed but smiled. 'Then let us be off.' Gaerhûl and the king's horse were brought over, and soon they were fording the Snowbourn and heading west.
It would be fourteen days to reach Isengard and return. Word of the king's travel ran ahead of them, and there were often groups of people afoot or on horseback at the side of the road, waiting for Thengel to pass and asking for his blessing. Denethor wondered where they all came from. Once in a while he would see a few houses together, spy a herdsman out upon the rolling plain to the north, or see wood smoke rising from behind a fold in the foothills to the south. The land was beautiful, a great green sea of grass that reached from the road to the edge of sight north and east, but it was barren. Far away, he saw the first spires of Hithaeglir, with a low, dark smudge he knew must be the ancient Fangorn forest just to its east. He was glad for the reassuring bulk of the Ered Nimrais beside them, providing an anchor against the vast nothing of the plains. Denethor wanted mountains and high places, trees and hills. Ithilien, for all of its danger, was more inviting than the plains of Rohan.
For the first day, Denethor did little but observe the king and his counselors. Gálmód surprised him. From the man's surly behavior in Edoras, Denethor had expected he would be either disdainful or flattering towards his king. Instead, the man was stern and direct. The man's darkness set him apart from the other men, as did his short-stature, but he held himself as proudly as any of the golden riders. His words were as proud as his carriage, chosen carefully and pronounced with dignity. Denethor listened closely so his own Rohirric would improve. It was clear that he was chief among Thengel's advisors, which made the man's words at the wedding more mysterious. Thengel asked for Gálmód's wisdom about planting, the weather, weanling foals, the making of ale, and many other things. In all of his answers, the counselor referred to the acts of past kings, or the wisdom in songs and tales, or the practices of their forefathers. He often corrected the faulty memories of the other counselors and always knew the customary way for doing this or that. The son, Gríma, said nothing if not spoken to, but listened attentively to everything.
The only thing in which Gálmód did not appear the master was conversing with the queen. He insisted in speaking Sindarin when addressing her directly, and mangled the speech enough to make Denethor wince. From the overly-patient look on Morwen's face, he assumed this was a long standing state between them. Thengel and the other counselors pretended not to hear it. Denethor did not understand how Thengel could allow Morwen to be insulted in this way, particularly as the other counselors spoke both Westron and Sindarin to her, and none spoke the latter as atrociously as Gálmód.
When they halted for dinner at noon on the second day, the eldest counselor, a man named Walda, asked in Sindarin if he could sit next to Denethor and speak to him. 'Please do,' Denethor answered in Westron. 'We should speak in the Common Tongue, though, as I know not your noble speech and I would not have you speak my own when I cannot return the courtesy.'
Walda bowed. 'Thank you, Lord Denethor, that is kind of you.' The man had questions about the battles of last winter. He had been a rider in Gondor at the same time as Thengel, though not for as long, and his grandson was now in Anórien near Cair Andros. It turned out this was the man who actually selected which riders would be sent. He was very curious about how the riders were being used now and what Denethor believed would come in the next year.
'Orcs in Ithilien, mostly, and raiding along the coasts. The victories of last summer did great harm to the Easterlings and to Harad. What do you see here?'
Walda shrugged. 'There are orcs out of the Misty Mountains more than before, and sometimes from the Emyn Muil. What concerns me most are the Dunlendings.' As the man spoke, his eyes moved to Gálmód. 'They are sly and devious folk, skulking in shadows. They ever swear fealty and friendship, we treat them with honor, and then they betray us. They will wait many years for their plans to unfold.' Walda's voice softened and he spoke in his own tongue, 'Even when they say they are of us, they plot our destruction.'
'Excuse me?' Denethor asked politely, allowing his brow to furrow in confusion. 'I did not understand your last words, Walda.'
'Forgive me, Warden, I said I hope they have not found favor with the wizard.'
***
They arrived at Aglarond midday on the third day. Denethor was glad to leave behind the empty plain and enter a green valley that rose into the mountains. For the first time, the land was thickly settled, reminding him of the southern vales. The cots were modest, but in good repair, and the land well tended. The heat of the plain retreated in the face of cool breezes flowing down from the mountains. Thengel said they should lodge in the garrison since their company would be too large for any farmstead to manage. Alebrand, the young lord of the vale, had joined them on their journey to Aglarond and insisted on staying with the king and queen in the fortress; even his substantial house would not suffice to hold them all. Denethor agreed, wishing to see the ancient fortress at the top of the vale. When he saw the spire of the tower and the stout curtain wall, however, he could not help but feel some disappointment. It was a squat thing, built from local stone, and there was little grace to it. It had been raised by Tarannon Falastur after the division of Arnor to augment the defense of the Fords of Isen provided by Angrenost, for the king had wisely seen that the north would soon lose sway over Enedwaith. That king cared only for the sea and gave little thought to anything that did not touch water. Even so, the stonework was strong and the whole well wrought.
Once inside, it was another matter. The open space behind the wall had encouraged the Rohirrim to scatter their garrison. Too used to horses as their legs, their outbuildings straggled up the gorge behind the wall. While the horses themselves were on pickets inside the fortress, fowl and goats wandered freely. The inhabited part of the tower was neatly kept, with sturdy furniture, well-scrubbed floors, and bright hangings to soften the echoes. Most of the tower chambers were locked. Twenty times the number of soldiers that were there would have been sufficient for the garrison.
Thengel insisted that Denethor should go with Alebrand and see the caves further up the gorge. The king himself declined the jaunt, saying he had seen them before. In truth, he looked weary, and Denethor did not miss Morwen's worried glances. His concern for Thengel disappeared when he saw the caverns. Perhaps they were wise, the builders, to make the defense so plain. It could not compare with this glory. He spent several hours following Alebrand about, awed by the subterranean splendor. Menegroth could not have been more beautiful. It was near dark by the time they emerged and supper awaited them. To Denethor's relief, the short rest had left Thengel looking much restored. After the hearty meal, Denethor excused himself to stroll upon the curtain wall and look down the vale. He could just see over the parapet. When he leaned against the wall, Finduilas's book pressed into his chest and Denethor wished for a glimpse of her, or even a new letter – none had come with the messengers from Minas Tirith. Under his fingers, the stone murmured of summer heat and winter ice and siege. Like himself, it was lonely.
Footsteps warned him that another approached. It did not surprise him that the visitor was Gálmód.
'Why are you following me?' Denethor asked in Westron.
'I only came to see if you…' Gálmód began in his twisted Sindarin.
'Your horse speaks better than you do,' Denethor crisply replied, still speaking Westron, 'though I doubt you are as clumsy with your words as you pretend. Speak like a civilized man or go talk to the animals.'
'Arrogant pig,' Gálmód grumbled in Rohirric.
'I have been around enough Riders to have picked up that much of your tongue,' Denethor said, 'however, as I said, I only care for civil speech, whatever the language.' Gálmód glared, but said nothing. The top of the man's head did not reach the height of the parapet. 'You are deep in the king's counsels, Gálmód. Why do you so dislike Rohan's greatest and most faithful ally?'
'Because you are arrogant pigs,' Gálmód said in Westron.
'Uncouth in any language, I see' Denethor dryly noted, 'Perhaps we should return to Sindarin. Then I would not understand you.'
'You men of the West are too proud and too clever,' Gálmód growled.
'You are jealous.'
'No! I do not want what you would offer, for it is given deceitfully. For all your greatness, you have naught to give but only take,' was the hot reply. 'You look down from your high places and think all others to be less than you.'
And if they are lesser? If they live rudely and wish for nothing beyond a full belly and some songs to sing? 'You would fault me for liking the mountains? I fault you not for liking the plains. It sounds to me as if you doubt your own worth.'
'Never would I doubt Rohan. This is a clean place, a simple place, far from your dark whispers. You steal our kings and leave them dead, or send them back ensorcelled.'
'And never have your kings fallen in battle save at Gondor's behest?'
'The Eorlingas are greater than you entombed specters!' Gálmód spat, 'We are not in misery and filth like the Wild Men to the west, nor will we partake of your decadence and decline. We could tame the West were we not always drawn into your battles. Did we not come from the east and tame this?' Gálmód gestured north towards the plains.
'You came in and settled on the foundations laid twenty-five hundred years or more before, like this,' Denethor tapped the wall, 'and have yet to raise anything to compare. Before you dream of taming the west, perhaps you would care to learn a few simple crafts, such as stone masonry?' With a nod, Denethor walked back to the tower.

Earlier tailgating for Buffett show
By Jessi Virtusio jvirtusio@southtownstar.com May 4, 2012 10:38PM

To appease the Parrotheads, First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre has bumped up the tailgating start time for the June 30 Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band concert.
Originally slated to open at 3:30 p.m., the parking lot at the outdoor theater in Tinley Park now will open at 2 p.m.
“We just know how much tailgating is part of the concert experience with the Jimmy Buffett audiences,” said Jon Reens, senior director of marketing/Midwest for Live Nation, which operates the theater. “In working with the village of Tinley Park, we were able to get an earlier lot time that allowed for tailgating.”
But some Buffett fans are passing on the Southland concert because of the late start to tailgating.
Previous Buffett concerts at Toyota Park in Bridgeview featured all-day tailgating prior to the show, with gates opening at 9 a.m. for last summer’s show.
Oak Lawn resident Jim Baker, 47, has gone to about 32 Buffett concerts and said he’s passing on the Tinley Park show due to the later start time and setup at First Midwest.
“For core Parrotheads, hanging out in the parking lot is a big deal,” said Baker, who attended the 2011 concert. “Last year, we had one of those inflatable pools. I think it was 5 feet across, 10 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep. We brought a water truck and filled it up. I also brought 2,000 pounds of sand and made a beach.”
“Tinley was never a ton of fun,” Baker said. “The only space is the walk-around. I guess that’s great if you don’t put in all the work and bring props and displays and really don’t think about what your theme for the year is.”
Reens said fans will have plenty of time to tailgate at this summer’s show.
“We are opening when we can open to accommodate tailgating,” he said. “I don’t know what they do at other buildings, but I know what we do typically at that building and we wanted to provide tailgating and took the steps necessary to provide it.
“The show starts at 8 p.m., and we’re opening the doors at 2 p.m. That’s six hours of tailgating. This tailgating experience is going to be like any you can have at any other building. We hope everyone will join us for the show.”

Bossier City — Dubach Coach Theodis Johnson expected a big game from his star player Friday.
He sure did get one.
Junior point guard Sueterrica Key scored a season-best 42 points in a 65-61 win over No. 3 Plainview.
Her 19-of-27 afternoon on the free throw line showed just how physical the game was. She made 15-of-19 free throws in the fourth quarter alone.
“That’s a great team,” said Key, who also added seven rebounds and five assists. “Now I got another game to play. I can’t even explain it. It feels so good.”
For two at Dubach, the win was particularly sweet. Johnson said this season is his last at Dubach. It’s also the last season for Key, who is scheduled to graduate in the summer.
“Sue Key was Sue Key,” Johnson said. “Whatever we needed her to do, she did it, but we can’t get too excited. We have another hurdle to cross.”
Dubach lost to Saline in last year’s semifinals. Plainview lost to eventual winner Pelican in the other semifinal last year.
First-year Plainview Coach Justin Miller brought a physical style to the court this season. The visiting Hornets trailed by two early in the fourth, but Key was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 6:51 left. She made all three free throws and finally opened more of a cushion.
Three Plainview players fouled out of the game.
“You can’t win with foul trouble,” said Miller, who used to coach the Plainview boys team. “We get knocked down, it’s a block. They get knocked down, it’s a charge.
“We came out strong in the first half, and we let them back in," Miller said. "We had to adjust due to foul trouble.”
Plainview slowed Key early, but the Hornets couldn’t maintain it.
“They started out with two on her,” Johnson said. “It was hard to adjust. They were pushing her, grabbing her. It was like an NBA game out there.”
Dubach started to slowly cut at its deficit late in the second quarter. Plainview led 26-18 with 4:24, but Key and company were just warming up.
Seventh-grader Jade Anderson made a 3-pointer off a Key assist and a Terriauna McMurray layup tied it at 26. Dubach led 31-28 at halftime.
Katy Doyle’s 3-pointer gave Plainview a 36-35 lead with 4:43 left in the third quarter, but the visiting Hornets never found the lead again.
Dubach’s Carletta Thomas got in early foul trouble, but Anderson filled her shoes.
Despite Plainview's foul trouble, the Hornets continued to fight late in the game. Morgan Mundy made a shot off a missed free throw with 6.5 seconds remaining and the Hornets added one more free throw before time expired.
Breanne Webb scored 23 points in the loss. Webb, a versatile senior guard/forward, played with three fouls late in the first half.
“My kids played their hearts out,” Miller said. “They have nothing to hang their heads about.”

He was stuck on the highway of life in traffic
Listening to the busted radio’s static
His car just a beat up, rusty, old heap
The door locks were broken, the horn wouldn’t beep
No air conditioning, a hundred and three degrees
Not a cloud in the sky, he prayed for a breeze
The windows were cracked, but only rolled down half way
But it was still better than walking to work every day
The traffic was caused by heavy construction
The signs up ahead told him to use extra caution
Bright orange cones guided him through the maze of a mess
The broken gas gauge said empty, that meant he had even less
So he turned the wheel sharp and he swerved past the cones
He put the pedal down and hurried around the construction zones
Cutting back onto the highway, he shifted into second gear
As he laughed at the line of cars in his broken rear view mirror
As he focused his eyes from the mirror back to the pavement
He was surprised to see a dark blue mass where there should be cement
A bridge had slowly eroded and was finally washed away
He slammed on the brakes, the old car began to sway
But those brakes were old and dull, he plunged into the sea
His car splintered on the jagged rocks, and the waves devoured he
His lungs slowly filled with water, stopping his young heart
He should have listened to the cones that warned him from the start…

Here's the relevant legislation:CHAP. LXXII.--An Act to organize Battalions of Sharp Shooters.April 21, 1862. Battalions of sharp shooters. How to be armed. Commissioned officers appointed by the President. Also field and staff officers. The Congress of the Confederate States of America do enact, That the Secretary of War may cause to be organized a battalion of sharp shooters for each brigade, consisting of not less than three nor more than six companies, to be composed of men selected from the brigade or otherwise, and armed with long range muskets or rifles, said companies to be organized, and the commissioned officers therefor appointed by the President, by and with the advice, and consent of the Senate. Such battalion shall constitute parts of the brigades to which they belong, and shall have such field and staff officers as are authorized by law for similar battalions, to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.May be armed with long range muskets, etc., in the hands of troops.

The Enkoder Plugin for Ruby on Rails
I am happy to announce that the Enkoder, a tool that hides your email address from email address harvesters, is now available as a Ruby on Rails plugin!
That’s right, you can now include the full functionality of the Enkoder (including on-the-fly enkoding) right in your own Rails applications.
What is the Enkoder?
The Enkoder helps protect email addresses by converting them into encrypted JavaScript code, hiding them from email-harvesting robots while revealing them to real people.
The Enkoder plugin provides an extension to the Rails TextHelper module that can be used to protect email addresses (or other information) by obfuscating them using JavaScript code.
Installation
You can download the Enkoder plugin as a zip archive. Then, just unzip the archive and drop the
enkoder folder it creates into your project’s
vendor/plugins folder.
Usage
There are two methods:
enkode( html )
This method accepts a block of html (or any text) and returns an enkoded JavaScript.
The second method is:
enkode_mail( email, link_text, title_text, subject ), you could just do this:
&lt;%= enkode_mail('user@domain.com','click here') %&gt;
And the following link would be returned (enkoded as JavaScript):
&lt;a href="mailto:"user@domain.com" title=""&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;
Of course we can also enkode many email addresses on the fly:
&lt;% @users.each do |user| %&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= enkode_mail(@user.email,@user.name) %&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;% end %&gt;
To enkode a snippet of XHTML, we can do:
&lt;%= enkode( "&lt;p&gt;This block will be hidden from spambots.&lt;/p&gt;" ) %&gt;
We could have anything we wanted in that block, XHTML, links, email addresses, etc.
For more information, usage details, and additional examples, please visit the Hivelogic Enkoder page.
Special Thanks
I’d like to share my gratitude to The Guru, wherever he dwells, for his assistance with the latest Enkoder algorithm. Without his help, we’d still be in the stone-ages, using easily-decoded HTML entity conversions or performing voodoo rituals to try and ward-off spam.

zzzzzzzzZZZZzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZ……
The above “zzz” are me pretending to sleep, it was NOT a peaceful night at the Hoge Runs house last night. It’s been super quiet/peaceful/friendly/relaxing at our apartment complex for the last 6 months (can you believe it’s been 6 months since we moved in??) but last night, ugh. To start with, I get random bouts of insomnia which just plain stink to begin with. Last night C was quietly watching an unnamed cartoon with his headphones on and the light from the TV was driving me bonkers. If it wasn’t for the insomnia bout it would have been cool, so I waited an hour to ask him to turn it off start sighing and tossing/turning loudly. And then, around 11, the noise started. We apparently have new neighbors across the courtyard from us and they were SO freaking loud! They were playing random music – everything from techno to Jay Z to Colbie Calliat, had all their lights on, were sitting on the porch smoking/drinking/taking FB pictures (“oh my gosh, this pic is so hottttttt”) and finally at midnight we called the “Courtesy Patrol.” They’re essentially the mall cops of our apartment complex and sometime around 1 the neighbors either gave up on their mini-party (there were only 2 of them, so weird) or the rent-a-cops asked them to shut it down.
And then, I was awake til almost 2. Blech!!! And wouldn’t ya know, I woke up again at 5:30?? Does anyone have any tricks for dealing with insomnia? I get a random patch of 3-4 days every month or so and absolutely hate it.
A few fun eats from yesterday, as I’m barely hanging on mentally today and can’t carry on much witty banter
BBQ cheeseburger meatloaf for lunch:
This was leftover from Monday night and so.freaking.good. It was the crunchy corner piece and all the BBQ sauce had caramelized on the edges and was loaded with flavor. I hadn’t made this meatloaf forever, and hadn’t made it with hamburger for even longer than that, but grass fed hamburger was on sale at Whole Foods this weekend and I couldn’t resist. The meatloaf contains 3 kinds of BBQ sauce (since we were running low and needed to finish the bottles), Paula Deen’s Butt Massage seasoning (hehehehehehehe), cubed sharp cheddar, bread crumbs, an egg, and bacon. The bacon truly takes it to another level…mmmm! Expect to see more leftovers later this week!
Along with my meatloaf I had a spinach, bleu cheese, tomato, carrot, celery, craisin, and candied walnut salad. For those of you who bring salads for lunch – do you have a way to make the spinach not get slimy by lunch time? I pack my salad the night before and it’s perfectly dry and crisp (I bring dressing in a separate container) and by the time lunch rolls around my spinach is wilted and kind of creepy. Suggestions??
And my afternoon snack was a pretty cup of lemon yogurt topped with fresh raspberries, perfection! I don’t know why I haven’t tried this combo before.
Dinner last night was chicken enchiladas – you’ve seen ‘em before, you’ll see ‘em again, so I’ll spare you a picture
Post-dinner I worked on a throw for the couch (pics to come soon as it gets a little bigger, right now it’s kind of like a sad scarf), and we caught up on this week’s episode of The Glades and The Colony. September is such a crazy TV month – True Blood finale, Dexter premiere, Glee premiere, Grey’s Anatomy premiere, Lone Star premiere, and on and on. What fall TV show are you most excited to see back?
And with that…have a wonderful day bloggies! I’m now going to go see about getting a coffee IV set up
hope you can find time to rest today! and then get some good sleep tonight!
and fall TV. gosh i haven’t even thought about it! ncis is a big one though. guns and hot men?! i’m soooo there hahahah
Hahahaha – I hear you! There’s a show on the Discovery Channel called Surviving the Cut, following various military forces in their extreme training – i.e. really, really ripped men who know how to fight off attackers, swim the length of the ocean (;)) and give you medical care. hawttttt!!!
Well, you know I can empathize on the noisy neighbor situ. Glad they finally chilled before the witching hour.
That salad looks yummylicious!

I arrived at the bus station in Vientiane, Laos, bound for Pakse in the southern part of the country via an overnight bus. In the dark parking lot the sign on the double-decker bus brilliantly declared: “Sleeping Bus.” I expected seats that reclined but was surprised by a triple tier of double beds stretching down either side of the narrow aisle.
Triple tier of beds inside the overnight Sleeping Bus that travels between Vientiane and Pakse, Laos
My “bed”was all the way at the top; I climbed up and introduced myself to my bunkmate for the evening, thankfully another woman. By wedging myself against the window and tucking my backpack behind my head I was just able to straighten my legs and I was fast asleep before we had gotten a few miles down the road. My bunkmate wasn’t quite so lucky. The metal railing on the outside of the bed wasn’t high enough and she spent the night hanging onto the rail to keep from falling into the aisle each time the bus rounded a corner. I woke up only once – to the sound of banging as the driver and crew changed a flat tire in the middle of nowhere sometime during the night. The Lao Sleeping Bus has to qualify as the craziest bus in the world.
And I thought that the “King of Bus” from Luang Prabang was the craziest! You are one brave woman!
Wow! And I thought the train to Chicago from New Orleans swayed and bumped too hard to sleep.
Oh wow! I’ve heard of these buses but didn’t realise you got so up close and personal with the person beside you.
Can’t believe there’s 2 laptops in that picture…does anyone travel without one anymore??
In a crazy bizarre way, this actually sounds quite practical. Though I’d rather the window bed than the aisle bed…
I’ve seen many of these in Asia – but never ridden in one yet! I’ve always wondered how safe they were…but then again – how safe is any transportation in Asia?!

Still Fried
Life on the lamp dock
The door is still locked, the phone off the hook, and the drapes still pulled -- and I'm not coming out until I feel like it. Right now, I don't feel like it. With no pearls of below-the-line wisdom to share this week, here's a photo I snapped while on a mission to the studio lamp dock last year. If you're in the biz, you'll probably understand -- if not, you'll doubtless be baffled by the terminology.
Much as I was thirty-five years ago.
I'll be back when I've got something worth posting, but given that the baseball playoffs are currently underway, that might be a while. We all have our priorities, and for a baseball fan, this is the best time of the year. When not at work, I'll have my eyes on the Toob or my ears glued to a radio broadcast for the next couple of weeks, until the World Series has been decided.
If time and inspiration permit, I'll put something up. Otherwise, see you in November...

Local 16 --
Oh yeah...
First and third are two bits of slangthat I don't think I've heard before. More West Coast lingo?
JD --
A "grumpy" is a flat metal plate with a double-headed baby-spud fitting allowing a lamp to be mounted (over or under-hung) on a set wall. I've seen many iterations of this particular device, but they all accomplish the same thing.
A "happy elephant" is similar to a grumpy, with only one baby-spud fitting. That means you have to think about it before screwing it into the set wall -- and make sure the gaffer knows whether he wants it over-or under-slung.
Both devices do the same job, but a grumpy is more versatile. With an under-slung lamp, the grips can use the top spud to mount a gobo head and short arm with a flag to top the light. You can't do that with a happy elephant.
One of these days I'll get some pics and post them -- in this case, a picture really is worth a thousand words...
JD -
While the slang is new to me as well - and I'm west coast - they seem to be variations of the standard "baby plate" or "nail-on plate" (I think I've heard them called "pigeons" or "pigeon plates" as well)
The happy elephant is simply a right angled version of these. Pretty common.
The grumpy, I have never seen before, but seems to be a combonation of the baby plate and double header side arm made for stands...2 90 degree heads. I wonder if these are made in-house because I can't find them anywhere.
I gotta say, the only thing I understood from that picture was "butt plug"...
...Now if you'll excuse me, I may have to go re-think my career choice. :)
Jessie M --
Your descriptions are better than mine. I haven't heard the term "pigeon" for about twenty years, but when I did, it was in reference to a junior plate for studio 2Ks and any 5K or 10K smaller than a Big Eye Tener. Essentially, a pigeon is like a baby-plate, but bigger and with a female receptacle rather than the male baby spud.
How this got to be called a pigeon is the deepest of mysteries.
Grumpys seem to backing up your notion that they're home-made.
My frame of reference comes from various books, Uva's Grip book, Set Technician's, etc. and on set slang usage. Neither Grumpy nor Happy Elephant appear in either book nor in the catalog of any grip manufacturer I've seen. One would thing that Mole-Richardson, being as old a company would have both in their equipment lineup. I hear and use the term pigeon or baby plate. Junior plate or Junior nail-on is the same, only 1-1/8" in diameter and female.
Butt Plug is in the same "category" as Ubangi.
Why does pizza box persist as slag for a 2x2' beadboard reflector when "real" cardboard pizza boxes haven't been 2x2' for ages?
...one would think....
AJ --
Given the current state of the industry, I wouldn't argue with anyone in our biz who's motivated to re-evaluate their career choice... but for most of us, here's where we are and here's where we'll stay. For better or worse...
JD --
The term "butt plug" seems to be universal (and in the same politically incorrect jail cell as "ubangi"), but I never ran into a grumpy, happy elephant, or becky (yet another device for hanging a baby or smaller lamp off a wall) for the first 20 years of my so-called career, during which I mostly did location jobs with a occasional forays on stage. It was only when I started working extensively at the major studios that I ran into all these oddly named items.
It doesn't really matter. There's always another way to skin a cat, and you can have a long, successful career in grip/electric without ever seeing or using a grumpy or a happy elephant.
As for "pizza box," I have no idea. Some key grip probably came up with that as on-set shorthand with his crew, and the term spread. None of the grip crews I currently work with use that term.

The retail giant just announced the latest collaboration — and we couldn’t be more excited!
Fresh off the success from the mega collaboration with Missoni, Target announced the next designer they’re teaming up with — and Michelle Obama fans will be thrilled to hear that they’re collaborating with Jason Wu!
“My collection for Target embodies my signature aesthetic of feminine sophistication, with a mischievous nod to the 1960s,” the designer said. “I’ve had an incredible experience partnering with Target and I am looking forward to bringing these affordable designs to women across the country.”
Set to launch in February, the collection will include apparel, handbags, and scarves ranging from $20-$60. Considering the designer is known for his chic dresses on the red carpet, we’re sure you’ll be able to achieve some of that star style — for a fraction of the price!
Are you excited for the collaboration?

After having a tough week, you’d think Selena would have some sympathy for Justin. But a source tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively that Selena has good reason not to pick up her phone when he calls. Keep reading!
Justin Bieber isn’t impressing Selena Gomez with his recent behavior. The 19-year-old pop star had a tough week in London, fainting on stage, showing up late to concerts and lashing out at the paparazzi. But Selena “doesn’t find his behavior hot.”
A source close to Selena, 20, tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively, “Justin calls Selena from time to time, but she’s over him. behavior hot or anything. She just wants a man who has his s**t together, and not a weird boy.”
Selena is currently having fun in Austin, Texas. Spring Breakers will premiere at SXSW this week. The former Disney star tweeted this pic, saying, “Deep in the heart of Texas.. I missed my papa!”
Justin Bieber Had The Worst Week Ever
Justin’s tour has been marred by controversy ever since the pop star, 19, had the “worst birthday” ever on March 1, and showed up two hours late for his show at the O2 Arena on March 4. A few days later, on March 8, Justin fainted and was hospitalized after complaining of experiencing shortness of breath. To top it all off, Justin lashed out at a photographer on March 9.
Hopefully Justin finds comfort by leaning on Will Smith, because it doesn’t seem like Selena is going to be helping him anytime soon.
What do YOU think, HollywoodLifers? Should Selena answer Justin’s calls?

Great
As someone with a purple themed kitchen, I am loving that it is finally becoming an "in" color. How about you? What color's your kitchen - and could these coordinate?
My kitchen is basically beige, yellow, and black. NONE of these colanders work for me
Also starting to think my yellow and white kitchen was a mistake.
Might switch to red appliances and utensils, I'm a Redskins fan anyway, so the colors would match up, if not the particular shades.
where are the measuring spoons/cups manufactured? The company website gives no info on those products. I don't want Chinese (or any) lead in my food :-/

Update: We've been told India. Hope that helps!
Call me crazy, but the lime colored items are catching my eye!
CaptainTr1pps wrote:Also starting to think my yellow and white kitchen was a mistake.
I have a yellow and white kitchen, and find it a perfect, bright canvas for a crayon-box of bright colors. Cobalt blue, bright red, vibrant green, and here & there a little purple and orange.

I -love- purple but have never updated my kitchen from the strawberry theme it had when I moved in.
However, I have taken the stance that Purple & Red look awesome together, and since I have the knives, my family agrees :D
bpr2 wrote:Call me crazy, but the lime colored items are catching my eye!
You should go for it then!
I bought one of these a couple years ago at the full price from a local store in San Francisco. They are serious about HAND WASH! One round in the dishwasher ruined it; it wasn't tagged from the store as hand wash and it got thrown in during post-party clean up. Just a heads up.

I. Pretty much no air barrier and insulation dropping all over the place. There are multiple furnaces(I think 4 or 5) all installed on top of trusses with grilles incorporated into the dropped ceiling. Ideally we would like to go with an unvented roof assembly with foam on the underside of the deck. My concern is all the non-sealed combustion appliances and corresponding combustion air requirements. We feel that not only is there no space to move the furnaces, it most likely would not be cost effective. We considered various insulation strategies on the existing attic floor, but seems to patchwork to me. Two options left were foam the underside of roof and either A) buy all condensing furnaces, or B) create a box around each furnace with combustion air running to the outside.
I would like comments on Option B, as I do not think new condensing units are going to fit in the budget.

You mean the furnaces are installed under the trusses,not above them right? My first thought is those are commercial vent-less units & thank goodness you are in Flagstaff.
I am not sure I would be worried about combustion air running to the units, but rather changing air out for the occupants with an HRV which would provide needed combustion air. Now if they are vented units, you have other issues
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply
The furnaces are installed above the bottom chord of the trusses - so in the attic space. These are normal 80% non-condensing, forced air, vented furnaces.
I didn't think about using conditioned volume for combustion air requirements. We will have to run the calcs and see if there is enough volume. If needed we can have pass thru vents from the living space to conditioned attic and introducing fresh air with an HRV.
We're you thinking of code issues for vented furnaces? That is what I was concerned about with having non-sealed combustion ap.0pliances all in conditioned space once the thermal barrier is moved to the roof deck and venting removed.
It seems to me, barring any specific code issues, you can pull combustion air from conditioned space if the volume is sufficient. It just makes me nervous, but barring replacing all the hvac, it may be the only solution.
Any other ideas or comments?
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply
I think option B makes great sense. The air injector fans shouldn't run more than a few hundred dollars each. Much cheaper upfront cost than replacing furnaces.
However, you should definitely map out a payback on the furnace upgrade option. With $9k in heating costs (will be less, of course, after the insulation retrofit), the payback may seem appealing to the building owner. It may also be possible to completely drop one of the systems, and replace it with a zone, avoiding one of the system upgrades all together. In general, I think option B is certainly a reasonable approach.

Field Controls has a "fan in a can" product that can be wired to the furnace. A pressure switch must be proved before the furnace will fire. Could be used in lieu of hi/low if only one envelope penetration was desired. This also works well for furnaces in crawlspaces that require "sealing" but don't have the budget for a furnace upgrade.
There's a statement in the code that allows combustion air grilles from the conditioned space of a building (larger sqin/btu ratio than to outside, if I recall correctly). It may be worth investigating whether or not you could deliver this combustion air from the conditioned space. Obviously not ideal to exhaust conditioned air. But, would be more affordable upfront, as you wouldn't need to box-in around each unit. This may be an issue related to thermal barrier coatings on foam. But, you'll be facing that anyhow if there is only a dropped-tile ceiling separating the attic from the office space.

What's the budget?
If you drop the bill to $2000, will they let you have the $7000?
I'd guess that'll cover cost of spray foam the space and allow for 2 hybrid heat systems. Can't image you couldn't manage that space with two 100mbtu/5 ton hybrids. I did this with a similar space. Building owner is now unhappy because he spends more on energy for his 2200 sf house.
I wouldn't start doing analysis without some participation from the client. They need to give you some $ for design and analysis work.
Also, you have the PAIN - $9000 a year. You need MONEY, what they are willing to allocate to this project. Then you need DECISION, commitment to move forward with the work if it solves pain for less than or equal to money.

New Releases: Former Champions CD Former Champions' self-titled debut studio album spans a multitude of genres including Rock, Funk, World-Beat, Live Electronics, and NuJazz. Amongst these tracks you will find a story of an American man's experience in the modern world, and his past and present dealings with life's fascinations. Tales of his adventures and of his realizations of the mystery of love are expressed through a variety of combinations of groove, harmony, melody, and poetry. Songs of Water - The Sea Has Spoken CD. Coming Soon: 10ft Ganja Plant - Shake Up the Place CD - 10 Ft. Ganja Plant comes back with a vengeance. Two years after releasing their critically acclaimed album "Bush Rock" and a year removed from dropping "10 Deadly Shots", the 'Plant is back stronger and with their deep in the pocket roots sound in full effect. The 'Plant were thrilled to collaborate with reggae legends Prince Jazzbo & Sylford Walker, each dropping two vocal gems, while Meditations great Winston Watson kindly provided additional harmonies throughout. Pulling out all the stops, "Shake Up The Place" was flown first class to the UK and mastered by Blood & Fire veteran mastering engineer Kevin Metcalfe. The sound is 70's exquisite. Beatlejam - Live at the Webster Theatre (2CD) - The third volume in the series is a two CD set, packaged in a fold out Digipak. BeatleJam are Matt Abts from Govt Mule, Vince Welnick from The Grateful Dead, Slick Aguilar from Jefferson Starship, Johnny Neel and Berry Oakley from The Allman Brothers This show was recorded in 2002. Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey - Race Riot Suite CD -. Last Week: Moksha - Here to Go CD - Las Vegas rock outfit Moksha, who finds a common musical stance with bands like Phish, Pink Floyd and The Grateful Dead, among others, release their second album. "Here to Go" was produced independently by Moksha Music Limited and four-time Grammy Award winner James 'Bon. "Starswarm", "Here to Go" and "Bubbles" Take a rocket blast, straight into a deep space, psychedelic funk, rock utopia, back down to earth with melodic pop, and back again into hyperspace with a rip-roaring instrumental. "Real Show", "Into Thin Air", and "Fruit of Tulum", stay closer to earth with Reggae, World Music, and Spanish Instrumentals, that keeps the energy moving and the horns and vocals shining. "Leg up" is a sweet melodic country inspired ballad. The cornerstone of the album "The Measure of all things" is a beautiful and mercurial song that delves into the depths of the mythic realm and the heights of keyboard solo heaven. The remaining songs switch between explosive funk with soaring vocals and classic horns, to good solid rock that pushes until it eventually comes apart at the seams With their music circling the world, then to space and back, Moksha is "Here to Go" Dave Littrell - Now I See CD - Dave Littrell's songs pair his storytelling skills with methodical acoustic guitar playing, bouncing rock rhythms and hook-filled melodies. The endless array of instruments Littrell has in his repertoire contributes a further level of sophistication to his effortlessly smooth vocal delivery. A solo project was a natural way for Littrell to express the lighter, more melodic side of him than the guitar solo-filled intricate rock and electronica of The Station. This progression culminated with Littrell's 2011 solo debut album, Now I See. In addition to his captivating vocals, Littrell plays acoustic guitar, bass, saxophone, piano, organ, percussion, and flute, on the album. Now I See was produced by Littrell's longtime collaborator and co-founding member of The Station, Dave Carter.

A Color Palette of Lilac, Red and Apricot
I was inspired by a potential new client whom I met with this past weekend. She loves the color Lavender {or lilac- I like saying “lilac”}, and I thought I would put together a color board to show her what she could do to make the color really pop!
What a super gorgeous color combo, love it!!!
Why thank you Coleen!!
I love your color board, but I would since I used lavender (lilac) in my wedding. My bridesmaids wore voile gowns. They were pale lilac, the maid of honor wearing a slightly darker shade. The flowers were assorted pastel colors including pink roses in the mix. I still love these colors.
Sheer brilliance, my lady!

(Forward to the Next Post in the Series)
While reading the “Oracle Tuning the Definitive Reference Second Edition” book I found a handful of interesting suggestions regarding Oracle wait events. For instance, page 406 of the book states that:
“Excessive db file sequential read waits on an OLTP database might indicate a suboptimal disk subsystem or configuration issues with the disk array. High I/O waits on the db file scatter read waits associated with large-table full-table scans may not always indicate a problem, but they are most commonly found on these kinds of databases:
- Data warehouse and Decision Support applications
- 32-bit Oracle systems with SGAs of less than 1.5 gigabytes
- Databases that do not have enough buffer cache space to cache their working set of frequently referenced objects”
Keeping in mind that the book is printed after the release of Oracle Database 11.2.0.1 (and possibly 11.2.0.2 for some operating system platforms), what, if anything, is wrong with the above quote? See example 1 on this blog article for a “Top 5 Timed Events” report section that is similar to what is found on page 406 of:
- Page 713 of the previous edition of the book
- remote-dba.net/oracle_10g_tuning/t_oracle_bottleneck_tuning.htm
HI Charles
My problem with the above text is non version specific. It just isn’t clear what Don means by Excessive and High in the extract above. In the case of the db file sequential read then there are about 2k single block reads recorded in the timespan of the report – we don’t know what that timespan is Don doesn’t say (and so we can’t draw his conclusion that it is I/O bound even) – but 2k disk reads in a timeframe that you can do 25k multiblock reads doesn’t seem excessive. In that case perhaps he means excessively long. Now this makes more sense since his single block reads took on average nearly 3 seconds if the output is to be believed (Frankly I don’t believe it to be reliable but anyway). However the High multiblock reads take on average a reasonable time (and the examples given strongly suggest that High doesn’t mean slow, but caused by workload or server configuration issues).
This section of the book would have been so much better if
1) We had a time frame to understand how Don drew his conclusions – in fact each report should have the timeframe and cpu count listed as the original report does
2) We had a clearer definition of Excessive and High (maybe single block reads that take longer than 20ms for Excessive wait times, or more than 100 IOPS/Underlying Disk for high wait counts.
It would be perfectly reasonable for the casual reader to conclude that any system where these 2 disk events are the top 2 is Disk I/O bound – in the sense that Disk I/O is constraining performance. I’ve seen enough examples of statspack reports on otn and elsewhere where help with the disk subsystem is sought for databases that appear to be on average idle to know that folk do just look at the names of the top events and think that this tells them something about the database application they have.
Niall,
Very well stated response. I agree completely with the listed shortcomings of that sections of the book and how to improve the book. Regarding your OTN comment, I think that it is hard for people to initially understand that a “Top 5″ report will always have something in the “Top 5″, and that something is usually an I/O type of wait event in a well performing database instance.

At long last, Cloverfield arrives to give New York City a whuppin'! Elsewhere Teeth aims to bite you where it counts, and on DVD, a bunch of straight-to-video oddities from Asia, Italy and Spain land in the good ol' USA.
Cloverfield
The major theatrical release of the week is, at long last, Cloverfield. Thanks to ingenious marketing, mystery surrounds this giant-monster-attacks-New York film, shot on digital video from the point of view of the survivors. Won't we all be surprised when it turns out to be Dragon Wars 2?
Teeth
Opening in limited release this week is Teeth, an old-fashioned story about a boy, a girl and a girl's man-eating vagina. That's right; a young lady discovers that her vagina sprouts teeth when she feels threatened -- sort of like The Incredible Hulk meets Little Shop of Horrors.
The Attic
From Mary Lambert, who directed Pet Sematary (and to a lesser extent, Pet Sematary Two), comes this ghost story of a teenaged girl who encounters a doppelganger in her new home. Who you gonna call?
Autopsy
A blind millionaire gets bumped off in this Spanish murder mystery from 1973. Whodunit?
Ghost Son
Prolific Italian horror director Lamberto Bava (Demons) tells the tale of a woman in South Africa who believes that her son was conceived by her late husband from beyond the grave. Just don't call her a spirit skank.
Land of Death
Italian schlock-meister Bruno Mattei apparently didn't get the message that cannibal movies burned out in the early '80s. This 2003 entry finds soldiers sent deep into the Amazon to retrieve a bigwig's daughter who's been captured by cannibals.
Matrimony
In this Chinese period piece, the ghost of a dead woman possesses her ex-boyfriend's new wife. Not exactly the ménage à trois he'd hoped for.
Monstroid: It Came From the Lake
One of those cautionary pollution tales from the '70s, Monstroid finds a Loch Ness Monster-styled creature being risen by industrial pollution. And it's not as friendly as Woodsy the Owl.
Red Eye
Not to be confused with the Wes Craven thriller from 2005, this is a South Korean horror story about a stewardess who works the night shift on a haunted train.

dogsoldier on May 9, 2013 at 1:32 PM
Nixon lied about, or covered up, or something, a third rate Watergate burglary. Iran-Contra was about financial shenanigans, moving Iran money to Contra funding. But this coverup … this is about basic representations about very important foreign policy issues. Why wasn’t there enough security at Benghazi. If a video caused the attack and deaths, then, the video is to blame, and we couldn’t have anticipated that. If the primary Libyan Islamic terror group caused the attack and deaths, then Hillary is to blame, for not identifying the threat and providing the proper level of security for our diplomats. Which certainly looks like the case.
Hillary let it slide.
Four brave diplomats died.

rbj on May 9, 2013 at 1:41 PM
It’s amazing how much damage the media is allowing to occur in order to protect Obama(and by extension the Democrat Party). Dead Americans in Libya, a stagnant economy mired in the worst recovery in 70 years, infanticide at abortion clinics, a health care system on the verge of implosion, the Middle East in chaos, the southern border wide open, and ironically even their own industry suffering massive losses in jobs and revenue.
And to think, we’re just past the halfway point of this guy’s time in office. Imagine how much more we’ll have to suffer in order for him to maintain his precious 45-50% approval rating from the ignorant masses. And then we’ll have to fight tooth and nail to avoid another 8 years of this under Hillary(that’s assuming of course that America survives that long).

burrata on May 9, 2013 at 1:54 PM
I’d describe this White House as positively Nixonian, but that would be unfair. To Nixon.
Good point, and a question. Is there a contemporaneous record of the President’s actions? Are there audio tapes? Is there any way of documenting what this failure as a CIC (and human being) did before blithely going nite-nite while his Ambassador (note: the President appoints the Ambassador, not Hillary Clinton) is under attack and missing?
One thing is certain. If then were now, you would never have heard of Rosemary Woods. There would have been no missing minutes from the Oval Office tapes. There would have been no tape in the first place.
IndieDogg on May 9, 2013 at 1:55 PM
But would Nixon have made it so we have not had a single instance of domestic terroism in the past five years?
We should all be on our knees thanking God for endowing us with such a wonderful super-smart leader.

One thing Nixon was, he was patriotic. He told JFK he wouldn’t put the country through a crisis by challenging the election results and there was plenty to challenge in Chicago and Texas. And when REPUBLICAN leaders told him to release the recordings for the good of the county, he did and it led to his resignation. Goldwater and the other two Republicans that pushed Nixon TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR THE COUNTY are in marked contrast to what we saw with the Democrats with Clinton and now Obama. For the Democrats it is what is best for me, the party and then maybe the country. Disgusting.

Half of the Obama gang is spewing Big Lies- about Benghazi, Fast and Furious, etc., etc.- and the other half is working feverishly to cover them Up.
Government is now a toxin re-labeling itself an elixir.

That is what prompted my question I had a broken arm and guests arrived to see our new house and I ahd nothing prepared and nothing to make. It was awful I felt so bad but I just couldn't do anything.
Hi, I was just thinking about this the other day. My husband is a farmer and didn't get his crop off last fall due to an early winter so last weekend we combined unexpectedly (didn't think it would be dry enough) and I ended up with neighbors to feed. I was kind of caught off guard.
I thought after that I should always have a pan of lasagna, some french bread, a white cake, strawberries and ice cream on hand. That way I could put a decent meal together without having to do much or get stressed.
...they came over last nite unexpectedly and brought a homemade souffle, pasta salad, wine, baguette, and apple pie with them.
Fendi
has only happened to me twice and both times the couple rang my doorbell with bags of food so we could all eat together, but no cooking required on my part!
Fendi
I keep tuna casseroles in the freezer. Make a salad and a baquette of frozen bread and it's done.
sorry.... unexpected guests was the topic
Frozen crab cakes....black beans, corn relish. salsa.....
from take-out places that deliver :D
Lagnasa, you can cook from Frozen.
How about keeping some bacon wrapped filets and salmon filets in the freezer. They don.t take long to thaw. Also for quick appies have some crab ragoons (freezer section) in you freezer with some cocktail sauce.This is what i do.

Create Valentine dishes with edible paint
For a party or special dinner, try decorating plain dishes with icing. Designs will be perfectly edible, and if you make a mistake while painting, just lick it off and start over. (Don't tell anyone your tongue made contact with their plate.)
To make this "paint," I mixed 3 tablespoons of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon of water, and 2 drops of liquid food coloring. Apply with a paintbrush. If needed, run your fingernail around any wiggly edges to smooth them out before they dry.

Love this Jessica! I totally want to do this!
I bet kids would like it. Or big kids like us. :)
That is awesome... I love this... and not only for Valentine... Great Idea... Thanks for sharing
Greetings from Germany
Catrin
great idea! Thank you for sharing!
:P laughing about the licking. Very cool.
This is such a great idea !!! This could be so cute for a surprise ! I'm really thinking of doing a special dinner using this idea !
Thanks so much !
Great idea! Now white dishes are in right now too. The only thing is if you had to put salty food on top, I would think it would get a little sweet. Too bad you can't make the icing more savory.
this is a great idea....A+J, already personalized for me and my husband! :D
Wow, simple and beautiful!!!
cute idea. great job -- works for any occasion.
so, so simple, lovely + clever! thank you for sharing your great ideas! :)
that is the cutest thing.
Aww... so SWEET!
(How many time did you lick Alex's? I won't tell him!)
Mum
this is such a sweet idea!
This is so clever! I can't justify buying lots of plates for different different holidays, but I could do this!
Speechless. This will solve everything, forever.
What a great (and simple) idea! I think I might do this for my girls' Valentine's Day breakfast plates!
I read your blog all the time, but I just had to comment on these plates. They are SO CUTE!!! I love this idea. Thank you for sharing it!
Brilliant! I just love simple but WOWEE ideas like this. Can't wait to plan my V-Day party with some of these accents.
You have such amazing ideas! Thanks for sharing them :-)
Oh how fun! I think this would be sweet at any point in the year. Maybe draw up some colorful balloons to accompany a piece of birthday cake?
You could, maybe, substitute the powdered sugar with corn starch. It will go with the savory dishes as well.
Thanks for the cute idea.
A wonderful idea. My daughter would love this while drinking her milk!
"Don't tell anyone your tongue made contact with their plate." - Hilarious!!! Thanks for the early morning laugh!
Brilliant! It's made even cleverer by being so simple :) Thanks!
so great and easy! yay!
thanx =)
Brilliant Jessica. So great to meet you as well!
Love this idea! In the past, I have used kids washable markers to write names or draw doodles along the outside border of dishes as place markers (not where food would touch), to rave reviews. This is a fun, safe and unexpected way to add some pizzazz to any meal :)
What a cool idea! Looks so cute!
Absolutely delicious! The greatest idea for Valentine's Day.
A kiss from Portugal and Congratulations for the fantastic blog!
I was just thinking the other day I wanted to paint dishes but have them edible. Does this wash off once you clean them?
Completely.
nice picture
What a fun and fantastic idea! Thanks for sharing.
What a great idea!
Love the hearts on the cups. Super cute idea!
You'll love this one! An orange pen!
Oh how fun!! Might have to try this!
The greatest idea for Valentine's Day
What a fabulous and fun idea!
did you use a stencil for the letters?
I love it! We're going to try it for sure this year.
That's just great ... thanks for sharing the idea!
This is wonderful! Mainly because you've found a way to paint with SUGAR. Bless you.
I love sugar. :)
Anonymous, nope, I freehanded.
What a fun idea. This would be great to personalize dishes for a party. Love this!
SO adorable!
So brilliant! Just shared on my blog, many thanks! :)
I love the idea, but the suggestion of LICKING someone else's plate is unbelievable. I hope none of you actually do this.
That was a joke.
I love this!!! I did it this morning with the kids and it was so much fun. I can't wait to show off my decorated plate tomorrow at a valentines party!!
I love the idea! shame I found it today! will be perfect for the Valentine's Day 2013 ;)

Fire needs Earth and Air to burn.
It's dependent upon Earth and Air to maintain itself.
Fire is stationary based on the location of Earth and Air.
Water is dependent only on itself,
Takes the shape of its container
and pretty much goes wherever it wants.
That's why the little streams of ancient water can make itself
Through the tiny little crevices
In the huge rock fortresses of the Earth.
Fire is mighty
But Fire is sometimes jealous of Water's pervasiveness.
Too much Water can kill Fire.
Though, Fire can evaporate Water,
It gently suspends itself in Air,
Only to condense later
And begin the process of renewal again.
Water is actually mightier than Fire.
Together, the unification of Fire and Water creates steam,
A very powerful energy
A carefully metered and balanced
Form of Fire, Water, Air and Earth.
Love is like Steam

Is there a Parkinson’s personality?
A new study by researchers at USF Health adds to a growing body of research suggesting that the risk for Parkinson’s disease may be higher among people with cautious, risk-averse personalities. Furthermore, the study found patients’ tendencies to avoid risk and prefer routine activities appeared to be stable personality characteristics across their adult lifetimes, exhibited long before movement disorder symptoms began.
The results were presented last month at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) annual meeting inNew Orleans by Kelly Sullivan, PhD, a neuroepidemiologist in the Department of Neurology at the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine.
Dr. Sullivan emphasized that much more research is needed to confirm the hypothesis that certain personality traits may be early manifestations of Parkinson’s disease.
Still, the presentation created quite a media buzz, with an article about the study shooting to the top of the Yahoo News! Most Popular Science stories list (May 1, 2012).
Kelly Sullivan, PhD
Dr. Sullivan and colleagues from the USF Departments of Neurology and Family Medicine and College of Public Health asked 89 patients with Parkinson’s disease and 99 controls (patients without Parkinson’s disease) whether they engaged in risky activities, such as skydiving, riding a rollercoaster, speeding when driving or gambling, as young adults (ages 20 to 35). They also assessed the study participants’ current personalities using a variety of measures.
“The people with Parkinson’s disease took fewer risks as young adults,” Dr. Sullivan said.
Dr. Sullivan was surprised by the attention generated by the study, but said she understands the inherent interest in possible links between personality traits and disease. “If you hear about a study linking pesticide exposure and Parkinson’s, you might not be as interested if you don’t work in agriculture,” she said. “But everybody has a personality, so they are more likely to relate to a study correlating characteristics of personality and disease.”

The Qin people were one of the clans that belonged to the Zhou Dynasty. Originally, they had made their home in the Qianlong area. When, in 770 BC, King Ping of the Zhou Dynasty moved his capital east to Luoyang, the Qin people moved into the Shaanxi region and the valley of the Wei River. They prospered there and inherited the infrastructure of the Zhou. Skilled craftsmen, factory sites, towns, roads, and irrigation were ready and needed only expansion. As the Zhou Dynasty fell apart and the various kingdoms began to vie with one another, the Qin Kingdom was well placed to take over. They only needed the right ruler and the right strategy. They had both. Most of the work of uniting and conquering the other kingdoms had already been done by the father of Qin Shi Huang Di, but he was well trained by his father and inherited his father's advisors. As anyone who is familiar with China has seen images of the Terracotta Horses and Warriors, little introduction to the dynasty has to be made. A collection of objects from the Terracotta Warriors and Horses Museum from the Qin Dynasty are described HERE on this site (opens new tab). The index also includes pictures of the Terracotta Warriors and Horses.

Hannah Werth (44) plays for the little girl who fell in love with the game.
Journal-Star on Werth’s Unparalleled Athleticism
By Randy York
This is a story about a 9-year-old boy and his mother who took him to the Nebraska-Iowa volleyball match in the Huskers’ last week in its historic Coliseum. It’s about Karla Wingard and Colin Wingard, her 9-year-old son whose sister got to see Nebraska upset UCLA and Penn State, two No. 1-ranked teams in season No. 36 – the final one at the Coliseum.
The experience was so awesome that Karla thought Colin deserved the chance to see Nebraska volleyball with its ultra-talented players and an atmosphere that was bound to intrigue even a star-struck little boy.
And it did … immediately.
“When we walked into the Coliseum, he saw Kenny Bell,” said Karla, a Human Resources manager for a Lincoln banking business.
Karla shook her head and couldn’t help thinking to herself: When isn’t that dude (Bell) at a home volleyball match.
‘I See Him … I Gotta Get His Autograph!’
Still, as things got quiet during the National Anthem, Karla Wingard was somewhat embarrassed when Colin spotted Nebraska’s sophomore wide receiver again. “I see him … I see him!” Colin yelled enthusiastically. “Mom, I gotta get his autograph!”
Wingard, who commutes to her Lincoln job from Rising City, Neb., told Nebraska assistant coach Dani Busboom that she was “pretty sure that everyone in our section” heard her son blurt out his intentions.
But a funny thing happened for a 9-year-old boy hooked on football. The minute he sat down to watch set one of a Big Ten Conference match, his enthusiasm switched from his favorite sport to something entirely new that appeared to his wandering eyes.
“He was amazed that a girl could do what was being done on the floor,” Karla said, quoting things he kept asking: “Mom, did you see Gina (Mancuso) hit that ball? Mom, did you see Morgan (Broekhuis) hit that?” Then, during the second set, Nebraska played right in front of a first-time grade-school fan.
Son ‘Crazy’ after Werth’s Somersault Play
When Hannah Werth made a defensive play that forced her to sprint to a ball and somehow manage to set it up so the Huskers could score, “My son went crazy!” Wingard said. “He was like: ‘Mom, did you see that? Hannah ran after that ball and then flipped after she hit it! That was awesome!’”
Awesome indeed … so awesome, in fact, that from that point on, “It was Hannah this and Hannah that!” Wingard said. “In my son’s eyes, she couldn’t do anything wrong.”
This is fact, not fiction. In that transformational time of meaningful maturity, an impressionable 9-year-old no longer was talking about getting Kenny Bell’s signature. He was talking about getting Hannah Werth’s autograph!
Yes, Werth’s scribbled name was the new holy grail that Colin Wingard wanted to chase, and a proud mother couldn’t resist writing a thank-you to Busboom, who shared it with Nebraska head coach John Cook, who, in turn, shared the amazing little story with his team. Actually, this modest narrative is so potent and so powerful that it should be shared with all Nebraskans, as they prepare to watch the Huskers take on Washington. If they win Friday night, the Huskers will advance to the regional finals against either Oregon or BYU for the right to proceed to the NCAA National Semifinals in Louisville.
Volleyball: Fast, Fun, Fashionable in Nebraska
I don’t want to over-hype here. But the most wonderful time of year really is high drama, high stakes, high octane and high interest for a state which has incredibly faithful football fans that are almost uniformly devoted to volleyball, especially when everything’s on the line and everyone seems to be planning watch parties, just like Husker football loyalists.
In terms of dedication, these two superlative sports are not mutually exclusive. Over decades, I’ve learned that even though volleyball can never match the numbers or Nebraska football fans’ unparalleled level of interest, even the staunchest gridiron fans make sure they track the volleyball results. even when a football-crazy state is preparing for a New Year’s Day bowl game.
First and foremost, Karla Wingard wanted the Huskers to know how much luck she wished upon them in a rugged regional at Omaha’s Century Link Center.
“Thank you Hannah (and the rest of the Huskers) for opening my son’s eyes to what girls can do,” Wingard said. “Hannah will definitely have a 9-year-old boy rooting for her this weekend. I hope they play their best and leave it all on the floor for a win not only Friday night but Saturday.”
Then Wingard said what all good Huskers add to the conversation: “Go Big Red!”
Is Werth Nebraska’s Version of Mia Hamm?
Hannah Werth is your classic premier athlete who grew up in a family that has five World Series rings among them, not to mention a mother and a sister who were both national-caliber athletes.
In my opinion, Werth is Nebraska’s version of Mia Hamm, the Olympic soccer star who transcended her own remarkable talents. Hamm once said that “Somewhere behind the athlete you’ve become and the hours of practices and the coaches (and in Werth’s case, parents, siblings, grandparents and uncles) who have pushed you … is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back … play for her!”
And that’s what Hannah does. She plays for the little girl she was and, at the same time, the young woman she’s become. She’s competitive, emotional, inspirational, fearless and motivating – for 9-year-old boys and senior citizen bloggers who can’t wait to watch Hannah and her teammates compete this weekend on a regional stage for the right to contend nationally a week later.
Here’s hoping fans from across the state open their wallets and get ready to close the year watching a group of young women that will give their level best to carve out a place in Nebraska and NCAA history.
Kenny Bell Hates to Miss Any Volleyball Match
May the force be with Hannah and all of her “sisters” and all of her “supporters” and that includes Kenny Bell, who loves watching Husker volleyball every bit as much as a 9-year-old boy examining the sport for the first time.
I can’t help but wonder how many more Colin Wingards are out there in Lincoln and across the state. In my mind, when Nebraska moves to an expanded Devaney Center next fall, the Huskers should sell out before the season even starts.
Husker volleyball is that good, that exciting, that exhilarating. It’s worth every penny, even when Werth does what all Husker legends do … exits stage left, waiting for the next batch of superior athletes to leave their mark on a program that almost always manages to meet pressure with … what else?
… Performance.

Voices from Husker Nation
We recently were in Tampa for a national convention. A Division II team was staying in our hotel while they were in a tournament there. When we said we were from Nebraska, the coach said: “Oh, you’re in volleyball heaven!” p.s. Colin Wingard is our neighbor. Ramona Ellison, Rising City, Nebraska

star defensive tackle on Nebraska’s back-to-back national championship teams in 1970 and 1971. Jacobson was a pioneer for the Huskers. He was an All-American, an Academic All-American, a first-round NFL draft choice and a trailblazer for all who followed his lead, including Ndamukong Suh, who shared those same accolades and went beyond, including winning his own Nagurski trophy immediately (not the Legends award).
Jacobson is quick to point out that every honor that came his way “wouldn’t have been possible without the exceptionally talented players who were my teammates and the icons who were our coaches,” he said. “I mean, I played with Johnny Rodgers, who won the Heisman, and played right next to Rich Glover, who won the Outland, plus a Lombardi (the next year).”
On the Same Staff: Devaney, Kiffin, Alvarez, Osborne
“We had such coaches as Bob Devaney, Monte Kiffin, Barry Alvarez and Tom Osborne – all on the same staff!” Jacobson said. “Just last year, Sporting News magazine named our 1971 team college football’s best of all time. Twenty-five players on that team went on to play in the NFL, and you have to remember there weren’t nearly as many pro teams then as there is now.”
In Jacobson’s era, the Big Eight was the nation’s most powerful conference. “In 1971, we finished first in the final poll, Oklahoma second and Colorado third,” he pointed out. “We had three shutouts in ’71 and only three teams scored more than one touchdown against us while we were scoring from 31 to 55 points every game. The only game we trailed in all season was against Oklahoma, and we’re still proud about that game being routinely referred to as the Game of the Century.
“I’m often asked what I remember most,” Jacobson said. “For me, it’s my teammates, and they’re also what I miss the most. Over the years, I’ve come to sincerely appreciate the bond we developed as we played together in the trenches. We picked each other up and were determined not to let anyone beat us. It’s all about working together toward a goal – to be the best in the nation – that I cherish the most. In the past few years, when I’ve had the opportunity to be on the sidelines, it brings back just how hard players have to work and how much they have sacrifice to get to the top.”

Based on the study of a dress, the Maison of Martin Margiela presented a collection that was more wearable than some of their latest offerings. Dresses were draped in a way that seemed haphazard and spontaneous yet undeniably precise. Cut in heavy wools, padded fabrics and floral printed furs in pastel hues, models slowly staggered across the runway looking beautifully disheveled and slightly bewildered in smudged eye make up and gorgeously soft and fluid evening wear. The colour palette was varied from underwear inspired flesh tones to bottle greens, bordeaux and black. The shoes at Margiela are always a treat, this seasons stand outs were of the variety where models appeared to be wearing stockings on detached soles. Made from nude leather and covered in sheer net stocking. The ultimate leg extension.

Apex save them later on. I found a whole bunch of information on the oracle forum but I couldn’t find the right information I needed, so therefore this post
My specific problem can be described as: we would like to let users add order lines to an order, update and delete them without saving anything in our database until the user confirms that the order is correct and wants to create it.
1.1 Delete Collection
Our first step when working with collections is to make sure that no collection with the same name exists. So create a process ‘on Load – Before Header’ that deletes a collection with the collection name you are using, in this case that would be ‘ORDERS’. We can use ‘wwv_flow_collection.delete_collection’ to delete a collection.
Now we are ready to create our collection, use ‘wwv_flow_collection.create_collection’ to create your collection. You might notice that there is already another thing I do, I already put one record in my collection. You are not obliged to do so but I do it here because now the user can already start filling the collection without pressing on a add row button.
I use ‘wwv_flow_collection.add_member’ to put a record in my collection. You must specify your collection name and then you must use p_c001 – p_c050 to specify your columns. In my first column I put a unique key that I will use when deleting a member from my collection. The third column specifies the amount and will be default 1.
1.3 Display Collection
Now we are ready to display our collection and update/add/delete members from it. Create a new page with a report where you will display the collection. Make sure you can navigate to it from the page where you create the collection (you can do it on the same page if needed). Add 2 buttons to your report, one to add a member and one to delete a member of your collection.
Some things explained:
- Our first column is a checkbox that will allow users to delete selected lines from the collection. The function ‘pck$genlib.f_get_next_row_id’ will return your row_id (0001,0002, …) so we can refer to the specific row in a correct way.
- The second column is the seq_id, automatically assigned to your collection members, we need this value in order to update the right member from the collection.
- The other columns must be displayed as text fields so we can put data into them.
Part 2 will include adding, deleting and updating members from your collections and will be posted very soon.
March 7, 2007 at 9:48 pm |
Working with collections sounds great but how do you prevent lost updates?
March 8, 2007 at 3:29 pm |
Hey jornica,I don’t really understand what you’re refering to, could you please elaborate?
March 18, 2007 at 3:16 pm |
Oliver,This an example of an lost update:Suppose you have two users, Scott and Adams editing the same order with one order line at the same time. Scott changes the description. Adams changes the price. If Adams saves his change before Scott does, Scott’s change has disappeared.In your problem definition you mention inserting an order. If order updates are allowed, the lost update can occur. I see in part 2 order lines are only inserted, there is no update and lost updates will not occur.

IAEA General Conference
Message to 56th Regular Session of IAEA General Conference 2012
by United Nations Secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-moon
I am pleased to send greetings to the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
It has been an eventful year since your last session, marked by extraordinary challenges that were transformed into fruitful opportunities for progress.
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March, 2011 was an immense tragedy that sparked a global response. The international community came forward with aid to the victims and came together to address the broader concerns about nuclear security and safety. The United Nations convened a High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Safety and Security in September last year, followed by a Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in Vienna. I welcome plans to hold another ministerial conference in Fukushima itself - a setting will provide a stark reminder of the stakes.
In the field of nuclear security, the Communiqué adopted this past March at the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit included a welcome reaffirmation of the essential responsibility and central role of the IAEA in strengthening the international nuclear security framework. It also recognized the value of the IAEA Nuclear Security Plan for the years 2010 to 2013.
We are also aiming for progress on the critical issue of nuclear terrorism. On 28 September, I will convene a United Nations High-level Meeting on Countering Nuclear Terrorism, which I hope will contribute strengthening the rule of law in this field.
With respect to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, one of the highlights of the 2010 NPT Review Conference was the agreement to convene a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, an initiative for implementing the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East.
I congratulate the IAEA for convening last November's Forum on such a zone, which was an excellent opportunity for participants from the Middle East and other interested parties to learn from the experiences of such zones in other regions.
I commend Director General Amano and his staff for the fine work they have been doing. The IAEA and the UN Secretariat enjoy a close partnership which provides a solid foundation for future progress in achieving our common goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.
Please accept my best wishes for success as you address the challenging issues on your agenda.

Few days ago, I happened to walk past a beautiful scene: a bright-orange pot, holding a tiny, Little-Prince-like tree, caught up right in the never-ending battle between light & shadow. Obviously, I had to stop for a look and a quick shot:
Half an hour later, still thinking about the photo, I felt like putting more emphasis on the subject, closing the frame in and warming the whole scene even more — while I was quite skeptical about Instagram at the beginning, dismissing it as yet another ‘hipster-app’, I came to love it quite fast after giving it a try: it’s fast, it’s simple and it lets me focus on the subject and on the title — a great exercise for any creative person (true, some use it to share their breakfast menu to the world, but I guess that can’t be helped in the current no-privacy world). So here came the second, more focused treatment, titled ‘It’s mostly about being there at the right time, eyes opened.’
As my Instagram account publishes instantly to my Twitter account, one of my followers retweeted it. While it’s always nice when people ‘like’ your stuff, seeing the retweet made me look at the photo again. Oddly enough, there was something new, something I didn’t see the first time. Or, better said, I realised that, in spite of the title, my eyes haven’t been open enough.
As a big fan of Pentagram, I have pretty much all the books they’ve ever made, starting with the above beauty, “Graphic Design: Visual Comparisons” (1964), written by Alan Fletcher, Colin Forbes and Bob Gill before the official birth of Pentagram (the Fletcher Forbes Gill studio eventually became Pentagram in 1972). The simple drawing on the cover, depicting the book’s title, would’ve probably went just as well on the cover of Alan Fletcher’s later book, The Art of Looking Sideways (2001). So with these two constantly roaming through the back of my mind, I saw an entirely different scene, where the orange pot was no longer the main subject, but where several other much more interesting ‘characters’ were ‘looking’ around in many different ways. The title this time, ‘… and there’s always more than just one way of looking.’
After this, I started playing around some more, trying black & white versions of the photo, other crops and so on. None made me happier than the above one, but it really was a great to be reminded that one can look at things from so many different perspectives. Of course, the scene had quite a lot of things to play around with and focus on, but the same exercise can be done with almost anything, even just one single object. For example, I remember one of the assignments my high school design teacher told me about: you are given a single push pin — you have to come up with a complex pencil drawing composition on a large A1 paper, based only on that tack. Now, there’s a challenge, if you needed one.
And since I mentioned push pins, there’s no better way of concluding it than with this Milton Glaser poster:

Chennai: Protests opposing the visit of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to India threw traffic in the city out of gear for over three hours on Friday. The protests come at a time when the city was recovering from the traffic snarls caused by protests against the alleged anti-Islam movie ‘Innocence of the Muslims’, made by an American. Sources said more than 200 members of the Viduthalai Chiruthaikal Katchi (VCK) led by Thol Thirumavalavan attempted to enter Sterling Road where the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission (SLDHC) was located. Their attempts were foiled as the road was closed on both sides not just with barricades but with barbed wire fences as well.
Though traffic was regulated at Sterling Road, temporary diversions were made across the city and vehicles piled up on Haddows Road, Valluvarkottam High Road, Tank Bund Road, Greams Road, Nelson Manickam Road, Kodambakkam High Road, GN Chetty Road, Venkatanarayana Road, South Usman Road, North Usman Road and Sir Thiyagaraya Road. The cascading effect was felt in Aminjikarai and on Anna Salai as well.
Meanwhile, Thirumavalavan, who attempted to ‘besiege’ the SLDHC after an agitation, was arrested along with 225 VCK cadre at 10.30 am. Some of the cadre lay down on the road obstructing traffic and were removed by force. Simultaneously, a group of Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam members attempted to besiege the BJP office on Vaidyaraman Street affecting traffic further in T Nagar area. The protestors were removed from the spot as the situation turned tense when enraged BJP members hurled stones at protestors who raised slogans against the BJP for entertaining Rajapaksa.
Protests opposing the visit of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa threw traffic in the city out of gear.
Motorcyclist thrashed
A motorcyclist on Sterling Road was roughed up by protesting members of the VCK after he reportedly spoke about the travails of motorists due to an agitation by the political party, to a television channel. As he was attacked, he lost footing and fell on the ground with his motorcycle bringing down a few other motorcyclists as well.
Police intervened and advised him not to invite the wrath of the protestors. The VCK members were attempting to lay a siege on the Lankan Consulate on Sterling Road. Police identified the victim as Kumar from Villivakkam. He was among the motorists stranded for nearly three hours due to the protest by the VCK cadre. He was even branded as a supporter of Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa by the protestors.

New Delhi: The Centre's proposal for raising the age of consent for sex from 16 to 18 years would be "regressive" and "draconian" as it would remain a penal offence, a Delhi court has said.
The court opined that keeping in view the change in social attitude and sensibilities, exceptions should be made while deciding the age of consent for sex as in rural parts of the country marriages are solemnised at an early age.
Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau made the remarks,.
"In the absence of such a safeguard the proposed increase in the age of consent would become regressive and draconian as it tends to criminalise teenage/adolescent sex. The need is to correct this behaviour and not punish," the judge said.
The court's observations came while acquitting a youth of the charges of kidnapping and raping a 17-and-a-half-year-old girl, to whom he got married and is now having a child with.
The court referred to the proposed special 2011 bill for protection of children from sexual offences, which provides. the acceptable limits and no exploitative coercive situation is reflected," ASJ Lau said.
Referring to the case in hand, the court noted the girl, at the time of recording her statement before a magistrate told him the child," ASJ Lau said.

Kochi: The Kerala High Court on Monday directed the government to produce the order, if any, to lease out Halcyon Castle, popularly known as the Kovalam Palace, to Ravi Pillai (RP) Group of Companies. A Division Bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice A M Shaffique issued the directive on a petition filed by K Dasan, secretary, Jana Samparka Samiti, Ernakulam, seeking to quash the order to hand over the palace to a private group.
According to the petitioner, the palace should be protected as an ancient monument and handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), under the Ministry of Culture, which is the premier organisation for archaeological researches and protection of the cultural heritage of the nation. The petitioner submitted that the Cabinet took the decision on the basis of a request from RP Group for permission to use the castle and the adjoining land.
“The political leaders and the bureaucrats are not concerned about the interests of the public and are showing eagerness to handover the palace to the RP Group. The Cabinet decision and all other proceedings before and after, which led to the order, is the result of corrupt practice,” the petitioner said. He submitted that the move of the government to lease out the land was vitiated by mala-fide and favouritism. The government has taken steps to hand over the palace and 10.2 hectares of adjoining land on lease, the petition pointed out.
The court directed the government to produce the order, if any, to lease out the palace to the Ravi Pillai Group.
“The RP Group has made stealthy and sham arrangements with M-Far Hotels which has controlled the palace earlier, for managing and running the property, including the Kovalam Hotel and Resort. Ravi Pillai, a business tycoon having high influence over the Central and state ministers has exerted high influence for handing over the possession of the palace,” the petition said.
The LDF government had taken control of the palace from M-Far Hotels Pvt Ltd, which had acquired possession of the palace when it bought the adjoining ITDC Kovalam Ashoka Beach Resort as part of the Central government’s disinvestment policy. The government had issued the Kovalam Palace (Taking over by Resumption) Ordinance in 2005 for the takeover. The ordinance was quashed by the Kerala High Court in 2011. While doing so, the High Court had ordered maintenance of status-quo and supervision of the castle by the Archaeology Department, the petition said.

Science paper: Emergent sensing of complex environments by mobile animal groupsPosted by Andrew Berdahl on Jan 31 2013 in Headlines, Scientific article, Video • No comment available open access from our publications page.
The short movie below shows a portion of an experiment in both visible (top panel) and infrared (bottom panel). Filming in infrared allowed us to track the fish unhindered by the light gradients. The trajectories we obtained could be overlaid onto the projected light fields to calculate the gradient tracking ability and uncover the mechanism behind the collective taxis we observed.

Exact Local Whittle Estimation Of Fractional Integration With Unknown Mean And Time Trend
AbstractRecently, Shimotsu and Phillips (2005, Annals of Statistics 33, 1890 1933) developed a new semiparametric estimator, the exact local Whittle (ELW) estimator, of the memory parameter (d) in fractionally integrated processes. The ELW estimator has been shown to be consistent, and it has the same asymptotic distribution for all values of d, if the optimization covers an interval of width less than 9/2 and the mean of the process is known. With the intent to provide a semiparametric estimator suitable for economic data, we extend the ELW estimator so that it accommodates an unknown mean and a polynomial time trend. We show that the two-step ELW estimator, which is based on a modified ELW objective function using a tapered local Whittle estimator in the first stage, has an asymptotic distribution for (or when the data have a polynomial trend). Our simulation study illustrates that the two-step ELW estimator inherits the desirable properties of the ELW: 501-540

Improving the SGP Through a Proper Accounting of Public Investment
AbstractThe Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) contains a serious error: the way governments are expected to account for public investment. Correcting this error and applying, as article 104.3 of the EU Treaty allows, the current rules of the Pact to a measure of the budget where the treatment of investment expenditures is done properly would, over time, drive the debt-GDP ratio to the ratio of public capital to GDP. Excluding net public investment from the definition of the budget that is relevant for the Pact would also help in the short run, by inducing countries to shift the composition of domestic demand, rather than to reduce 4220.

This world belongs to us, the products used in this world are created for us to make our lives better. So as I sit here at 1236am in my room I wonder its not necessary that only Industrial Design Engineers can improve the quality of a product, you and I can do it as well. Its our responsibility to create new ideas either they are about improving the quality of life, marketing of a company/idea, improving a product etc so that it enhances our lives.
So based on these thoughts, IDEAS FROM LIFE blog is born. Here I will give my ideas on how to improve any product. Ideas will range from completely silly to very thought provoking and I hope you all join me in this process.

Author's Description:
FINAL SUBMISSION
Well this is it. Finally over. Made some finishing touches here and there. Also see if you can spot Bubbles Favourite toy ‘octi’
This was a blast today and i had tons of fun doing something like this. Hope you all did!
Gah i hate not knowing what the timezone is for this forum! It’s Friday 8th 2am (yes in the morning lol) and if i put that in my post doesn’t show. Had to guesstimate the time to get it on lol
WIP4 (Click to view maximum size!)
Okay here’s my 4th WIP. Made a lot of changes to this one. Changed the leg armor a bit. Also changed the shoes. Improved sword. Also (most obvious one) i’ve redone the face. Unfortunately i’m struggling on the hands A LOT! just cant seem to get it right. Next update might involve a more completed character and work on the background (which i didn’t do in this wip) Thanks again for watching!
Okay i’ve somewhat got the body complete. I just hate the face so i might do that part all over again. And there are some parts on the lower legs that i’m not happy with so i will be making changes there too. Threw in a quick background and realised how i will have to change the lighting on the armor lol. Would like some critique on this and any improvements i can make. Thanks
Still working on the armor and i’m really struggling with the face. I’ve re-did the eyes and i’ve just realised that the one of the right looks completely wrong, so i would really appreciate some feedback so i can make myself a lot better as an artist. Judging from other peoples entries i got no chance of winning haha but it’s so fun just participating in this!
EDIT: Okay i’ve decided to do a full body pose, relaxed of course. I don’t usually do this so could anyone point out any issues with the anatomy, pose errors that they can find? would be much helpful! thanks guys
EDIT EDIT: Okay from the feedback, i’ve shifted the facial features more slightly to the right. Better?
im not the best with anatomy, im still learning just as you are but i think the problem with your eye is that its not on an angle her face is at 3/4 view but both eyes are front on.
ahh yeah i did try that, but it just felt that her eyes looked too far apart. I’ll keep on trying to redo it, thanks for your input =)
Faces are the one of the hardest things to get right. It took me months before I started getting the hang of it. I recommend to keep practicing the face structure. There are some good books out there, it’s just a matter of finding them. The book I started on was by Jack Hamm “Drawing the Head and Figure” and I also use Chris Hart’s “Drawing Cutting Edge Anatomy” book. Both are very very good books. I would try to find copies of those to use as reference. I still do and will have to for a long time.
Thanks Havok, i’ll definitely look into those books you’ve suggested
with where you are now if you were to remake her what would change?
umm probably everything hahah. However for this comp i will be changing the face and also adjusting the armor, will also be working more on the background i guess.
I know how you feel. I left my piece last night in a bad mood as I could not get the face right and I kept screwing it up no matter what i did! Keep it up you are getting there

Poitou CharenteThe Poitou-Charentes region has a magnificent coastline - and is one of the finest destinations for countryside holidays. The region's reputation is closely linked to cognac – the superb, refined, locally-produced spirit. Poitou-Charentes is a land of tradition, where skills are passed on from generation to generation: its inhabitants know how to wait for a good product to mature – and they also know how to take the time to enjoy life and to welcome guests.

The problem of identifying significantly differentially expressed genes for replicated microarray experiments is accepted as significant and has been tackled by several researchers. Patterns from gene expression (PaGE) and q-values are two of the well-known approaches developed to handle this problem. This paper proposes a powerful approach to handle this problem. We first propose a method for estimating the prior probabilities used in the first version of the PaGE algorithm. This way, the problem definition of PaGE stays intact and we just estimate the needed prior probabilities. Our estimation method is similar to Storey's estimator without being its direct extension. Then, we modify the problem formulation to find significantly differentially expressed genes and present an efficient method for finding them. This formulation increases the power by directly incorporating Storey's estimator. We report the preliminary results on the BRCA data set to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach

Reliable detection of objects using the Hough transform is often possible even if just a small random poll of edge points is used for voting. This can lead to significant computational savings. To reduce the risk of errors, it is customary to preset the poll size to a value that is much larger than necessary in average conditions. An adaptive setting of the poll size in the probabilistic Hough transform is suggested. It is experimentally demonstrated that by monitoring changes in the ranks of peaks in the parameter space, sensible decisions on voting termination can be made. Adaptive stopping leads to polls that are on average smaller than the fixed poll that leads to the same error rate. In many applications the number of objects to be detected is unknown. Finding the number of appearances of an object in a noisy image is difficult, especially with partial data. The authors present an adaptive stopping rule that terminates voting as soon as any number of objects seem to be reliably detected, even though the existence of others may not be ruled out yet

A pattern classification method is proposed for remote sensing data using neural networks. First, the authors apply the error backpropagation (BP) algorithm to classify the remote sensing data. In this case, the classification performance depends on a training data set. In order to get stable and precise classification results, the training data set is selected based on geographical information and Kohonen's self-organizing feature map. Using the training data set and the error backpropagation algorithm, a layered neural network is trained such that the training patterns are classified with a specified accuracy. After training the neural network, some pixels are deleted from the original training data set if they are incorrectly classified and a new training data set is built up. Once training is complete, a testing data set is classified by using the trained neural network. The classification results of LANDSAT TM data show that this approach produces excellent results which are more realistic and noiseless compared with a conventional Bayesian method

Recent regulatory requirements in the United States and the growing complexity of transmission grids worldwide have prompted the need for greater substation data communications security. Southern company, one of the largest utilities in North America, required a comprehensive security solution for providing and controlling access to intelligent electronic devices within its substations. Using a combination of commercial hardware and software, in conjunction with software developed by SUBNET solutions Inc., southern company has begun a standardized rollout of the proposed solution across four of its electric utility companies. This paper explores the challenges faced by southern company and other utilities, the subsequent development of a solution, and the future benefits of that solution.

Simple analytical models have proved very useful in understanding vibration energy harvesters driven by a sinusoidal acceleration. Corresponding analyses for broadband excitations have been absent. In this paper, we present new closed-form results on the output power, proof mass displacement, and optimal load of linear resonant energy harvesters driven by broadband vibrations. Output power dependence on signal bandwidth is also considered. The results are compared with those that are already well established for a sinusoidal acceleration. We formulate a stochastic description of more general energy-harvester models and show that the influence of elastic mechanical stoppers on the output power is dependent on the electrical load for large amplitude vibrations.

We propose an analytical model for the performance analysis of the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) function of the IEEE 802.11e standard. The proposed discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) model incorporates the main quality-of-service (QoS) features of 802.11e, namely, contention window (CW), arbitration interframe space (AIFS), and transmit opportunity (TXOP) differentiation. Due to its specific design, the proposed DTMC model jointly considers the state of the medium access control (MAC) layer buffer and the MAC differentiation mechanisms which facilitates a novel performance analysis framework at an arbitrary traffic load. Analytical and simulation results are compared to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach for varying traffic load, EDCA parameters, and MAC layer buffer space.

We propose and assess new algorithms for adaptive detection and tracking based on space-time data. At design stage we take into account possible spillover of target energy to adjacent range cells and assume a target kinematic model. Then, resorting to the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) we derive track-before-detect (TBD) algorithms that can operate in scan-to-scan varying scenarios and, more important, that ensure the constant false track acceptance rate (CFTAR) property with respect to the covariance matrix of the disturbance. Moreover, we also propose CFTAR versions of the maximum likelihood-probabilistic data association (ML-PDA) algorithm capable of working with data from an array of sensors. The preliminary performance assessment, conducted resorting to Monte Carlo simulation, shows that the proposed TBD structures outperform the ML-PDA implementations especially in terms of probability of track detection (and for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values).

FPGA-based solutions have become more common in embedded systems these days. These systems need to communicate with external world. Considering high-speed and popularity of Ethernet communication, a reliable real-time Ethernet component inside FPGA is of special value. To that end, this paper presents a new solution for 100 Mb/s FPGA-based Ethernet communications with timing analysis. The solution deals with "Reduced Media-Independent Interface" in its physical layer. UDP is the network protocol which is implemented from physical to transport layer. For getting used in real-time applications, timing analysis is done in the communication system. Component based software engineering is used in the design and development processes. In order to test the components inside FPGA, two different approaches are utilized. Signal measurement in combination with introduced windows based application contributes much in testing and validation phases.

Free riding in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems means a peer utilizing other peers' network resources without contribution. Recent empirical studies have identified serious free riding problem in P2P streaming systems which will cause severe performance degradation. However, scarce existing work is focused on theoretical modeling and analysis of free riding problem. In this paper, we present a two-class fluid model to model and analyze the free riding problem in P2P streaming systems. With this model, we provide a quantitative analysis of the effect of free riding on P2P streaming systems particularly in the steady state with two scenarios: one without seeders and the other with seeders. The steady state analysis results show that (i) both honest peers and free riders have a much lower download time in the scenario with seeders than that without seeders, and thus it is essential to introduce mechanisms to incentivize the seeders to stay in the system, and (ii) free riders can benefit greatly from the streaming server and the seeders, and thus it is important to introduce differentiated service mechasisms for the server and seeders in P2P streaming systems.

The Influence of
Nano-Dots Decoration on Substrates on Flux Pinning Strength in
Thin Films
Nano-sized CeO2 dots were deposited on (001) LaAlO3 substrate by rf magnetron sputtering. After the processing of the artificial decoration defects on the substrate, 100-nm, 150-nm, 200-nm, and 400-nm-thick Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 (Tl-2212) thin films were grown on it, using dc magnetron sputtering and post annealing process. AFM images showed that the CeO2 nano-dots were distributed well on the substrate surface with 70 nm in diameter and 5 nm in height, and the density of nano-dots was 25±3 dots/μm2. SEM images were used to observe the variations on film surface. Transport critical current density Jc was measured both on Tl-2212 film with nano-dots decorated substrate and untreated single crystal LaAlO3 substrate. From the results, Jc values of Tl-2212 films with nano-dots decorated substrate were lifted significantly, and the pinning strength was improved on Tl-2212 films by nanostructure defects induced from nano-dots.

We provide accurate analytical estimates of timing- and amplitude-jitter caused by nonlinear pulse interaction in systems based on highly dispersed optical pulses, both for coherent and noncoherent pulse streams. We show that the system penalties reduce monotonically with pulsewidth and with increasing fiber dispersion. We demonstrate that proper dispersion pre-compensation can result in a significant reduction of the nonlinear inpairments and provide analytical tools for obtaining the optimal pre-compensation parameters.

A new class of neural prosthetic systems aims to assist disabled patients by translating cortical neural activity into control signals for prosthetic devices. Based on the success of proof-of-concept systems in the laboratory, there is now considerable interest in increasing system performance and creating implantable electronics for use in clinical systems. A critical question that impacts system performance and the overall architecture of these systems is whether it is possible to identify the neural source of each action potential (spike sorting) in real-time and with low power. Low power is essential both for power supply considerations and heat dissipation in the brain. In this paper we report that state-of-the-art spike sorting algorithms are not only feasible using modern complementary metal oxide semiconductor very large scale integration processes, but may represent the best option for extracting large amounts of data in implantable neural prosthetic interfaces.

The Pairwise Kalman Filter (PKF) [W. Pieczynski and F. Desbouvries, “Kalman Filtering Using Pairwise Gaussian Models,” in Proc. Int. Conf. Acoust., Speech, Signal Process. (ICASSP), Hong Kong, Apr. 2003] is an extension of the classical Kalman filter that keeps propagation equations explicit, i.e. it does not require time consuming simulations. The contribution of this note is twofold. First, new robust equations for filtering, smoothing and unsupervised off-lined parameters estimation based on QR decompositions are presented. Second, since the model is over-parametrized, we give a simple condition to uniquely characterize a filter of interest when the dimension of observations is equal to the dimension of states. Unsupervised experiments based on simulated data confirm the nice behavior of the robust PKF, even for a limited number of observations.

An Alternative Banner
The flags in this layout is inspired by the flags and mast on the boat I photographed. I also decided to dip into my rarely used but often added to stash of laces to use for the flags. I think it is a nice alternative to the horizontal, paper version. Let's face it, with the celebrations we are having this year in the UK, I think the bunting craze is going to stay with us a while yet.
I did this layout for Sarah's Cards earlier this year. I've used die cuts from Pink Paislee Nantucket collection, perfect for a day at the beach. The photos are from out day trip to Aldeburgh last summer. It was warm but it is never warm enough for me to go in the sea anywhere here. But H being the hardy soul he is, did.
I was contemplating making a trip to beach yesterday and today, we ended up with the greyest day. Perhaps it is best that I don't contemplate and plan...just do it...surprise the "weather man" so he does not put a damper on my plans.

Love the lace banner it works really well on this layout and I like the misting effect too!

Beware the Python generators
Generators and list comprehension in Python are very closely related. After all, each gives you an iterable. However, I really wish that generators came with a “DANGER: Handle with care!” label. The problem is that while the syntax for creating a generator vs a list differs in exactly two characters, generators have side effects that are both subtle and easy to overlook. Let’s take a look at some code:
items = get_items() for x in items: print x for x in items: print x
Does that code look reasonable to you? It does, until I tell you that get_items() returns a generator. You see, generators have an internal pointer to the index and cannot be reset. Thus the sequence of items will only be printed once. This can be solved by convention. Some libraries will prefix the function’s name with an “i” converting get_items to
iget_items(). The built-in Python function
xrange(), a generator version of range(), is another example of trying to solve this problem with convention.
Let’s look at another piece of code:
try: numbers = (int(x) for x in line.split(',')) except ValueError: numbers = [] # Handle the case where the input is invalid for num in numbers: print num
That looks reasonably good, no? Well, generators are lazy, they have to be. Thus number = … line defines the generator, but not a single call to
int() is made at that point. The calls to
int() are made during the iteration, while the for loop is executing, which is outside of the try/except block. There are several solutions that exist here, ranging from using a list comprehension instead to placing the for loop inside the try/except block.
Another difference between lists/tuples/sets/other sequence types and generators is that generators have no length. Calling len(get_items()) would result in an error. This is by design: generators may be infinite, and thus it does not make sense to ask what their length is.
I love generators as much as the next guy. However, I think care must be taken when using them. My rules of thumb are:
First, if you are using a generator to optimize for speed: don’t. In casual observation they are indeed faster than lists, but lists are so flipping fast already that unless you are processing millions of items, it will make no difference. Exception to this rule is when you are in fact processing millions of items or you routinely need to create a lot of iterables in your hot loop and your profiler tells you that this is the bottleneck.
Second, if you are optimizing for memory usage, use generators only if you have a significant number of records. A list of 100 ints will make little difference. A list of ten million log entries is going to cost you some RAM.
Third, never return a generator from a library method, or any type of opaque object. Generators should mostly be used for intermediate iterables until a final result is obtained. Avoid the confusion of get_items() returning a generator.
Lastly, use generators if you must. They are the only way to create infinite iterables, and they do have small speed and large memory advantages over other iterables. If you use them, put in several safeguards: make sure to document the fact that a generator object is used in multiple places, create a convention for what these objects (and the corresponding functions) will be called and test, test, test. As I mentioned at the beginning of this post: generators should come with a warning to not surprise unsuspecting maintainers of your code.

This paper presents results of a survey completed by 195 teachers which investigated teachers’ challenges in evaluation of English language learners (ELLs) enrolled in schools in the northern Illinois area of the United States. All participants were certified teachers in the process of completing necessary coursework to obtain additional certification to work with ELLs. Surveys were completed by individuals working as mainstream, bilingual, and/or English as a second language teachers. Specifically, the teachers reside and work in the City of Chicago or nearby suburbs. Survey questions asked the teachers (1) what types of questions they consider appropriate for ELLs, (2) how they view the contribution of accommodations in testing and evaluation, (3) if they address issues of culture bias in evaluation and, (4) if they test through traditional or non-traditional formats. Findings identify areas where teachers’ knowledge bases require additional preparation to effectively instruct and evaluate ELLs. Survey results are used to develop recommendations for curriculum for courses that prepare teachers to fairly test and evaluate linguistic minority populations of immigrants and/or heritage speakers in the process of acquiring English as a second language.

Just when you think you don’t have a blog post brewing, a big one suddenly appears out of nowhere!
I hadn’t decided if I was going to do a post for today’s Sepia Saturday when I had to nip out for milk late this afternoon and I just went to the nearest shop, the Co-Op in Ormiston. As I drove up the Main Street, the sun was shining on the familiar old market cross standing slap-bang in the middle of the street and I thought it looked better than usual in the low sunshine. I snapped it with my phone and thought no more of it – I just enjoy taking random photos that I like and phones make that a breeze.
I lived in Beech Cottage (the little white house you can just see on the left) for a couple of years in the late 90′s, and I’ve had a strong connection with the village of Ormiston throughout my life. Our local parish Church was the one in Ormiston when I was a child (not that we went very often) – and the village had our nearest swing park which was 2 1/2 miles away from the farm, so the four of us kids had Special Outings with my Porter Grandparents to give Mum peace for an hour – a rare treat for all of us! These grandparents are on Mum’s side – not the relatively carefree tree-climbing granny you already know from Dad’s side.
Back home (with milk) I thought about Sepia Saturday and went to one of my favourite websites for looking at miscellaneous old Scottish stuff – RCAHMS to see what they had on Ormiston Cross. A lot of their data can only be accessed in person, however, they do have some interesting things online (have a look if you have any Scottish connections) and I found this photo
Item SC 1164189
Caption General view from W.
Notes Scanned from a glass plate.
Category SCANNED IMAGES
Object type Digital image
This is a copy of EL 1779
Person B C Clayton
Role Photographer
The original cobblestones have been uncovered since this photo was taken (shame it’s not dated), and if you look very closely down the at the far end of the Main Street, you can see another monument. This is dedicated to Robert Moffat (1795 – 1883), the Scottish missionary and explorer (his daughter, Mary, married “Dr Livingston, I Presume”). My Granny Porter claimed that we were the “great great great great great grandchildren” of Robert Moffat, and we paid homage at the monument on some visits to the swing park. The monument bears an image of the great man and his even greater beard.
My Granny’s paternal grandmother was a Moffat, and somehow a (dare I say “tenuous”) connection had been made between Robert and her granny, and by the time it reached us it was Law. Needless to say, in all my years as a genealogist, I have been unable to prove any connection and suspect it is highly unlikely that there is one, beyond sharing the Moffat surname.
However, we did get to have a go on the see-saw and the swings
There’s now a plaque on the East side of the railings giving more info on the Cross
I’m very pleased that I wasn’t subjected to public exposure of malefactors
It’s Sepia Saturday – check out the other contributors’ interesting old photos, and why not have a go at posting one of your own – it doesn’t have to be sepia
The swings were definitely worth it – even if there is no connection! There is so often a thread of truth to family lore that you may yet find the link – perhaps a very, very distant one.
Fascinating! I’m glad the cross still exists, it could have been easily vandalized or destroyed during all these centuries.
This is interesting information about the cross, malefactor or not.. Shame you are unable to prove the Moffat link.
Very interesting…and all because you ran out of milk! It’s nice to see the cobblestones revealed too. I couldn’t get one of the links to work Jo; it may have been just me, but the great man and his beard one took me off somehere else.Thought I’d mention it anyway.
Thanks for letting me know, Little Nell – I’ve uploaded one of my own pics of “the beard” instead
Jo
As I was viewing your “cross”, the radio in the background came up with the program, “Back to the Bible”, a message there perhaps?????
Spooky! Robert Moffat translated the Bible (it took him 30 years) into the language of the Kuruman people. Quite an achievement for a humble Scottish gardener
I like the Ormiston Cross too, but it’s the Robert Moffat memorial that caught my eye. I had a childhood friend – also named Moffat – who told me that he was a descendant of Robert. However, this I believed, and still do, since we were living in the right part of the world at the time (Rhodesia), and it was probably his great-grandfather who became Prime Minister of the country. I have a CDV of Robert Moffat which I wrote about on Photo-Sleuth a few years ago.
Hi Brett – that’s a cracking picture of Robert and his beard! I think your friend is more likely to be related than I am, given that none of Robert’s sons seemed to have returned to Scotland. I really should investigate his grandsons now
Jo
There’s a tradition that needs to be brought back: the public exposure of malefactors. Although I’m not sure the graffiti painters etc, would care. They might like it.
Yes, there’s “kudos” attached for some malefactors these days, rather than Shame. More’s the pity…

It’s been a while since we’ve visited the Library of Congress’s Prints and Photographs Online Special Collections, but today I’ve a special treat: a few selections from the Library’s 420 digitized images of the Tissandier Collection, which it purchased in 1930. Brothers Gaston and Albert Tissandier, 19th century French balloonists, collected balloon and other flying machine documents ranging from technical illustrations to cartoons. The Library describes the holdings:.
And on the images’ public domain status:
Publication and other forms of distribution: Permitted. There are no known restrictions on the use of images in this collection.
Credit Line:Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, [reproduction number, e.g., LC-DIG-ppmsca-02438]
Here’s an early design from 1783 for a balloon equipped with sails [Credit--Library of Congress, P&P Division, ppmsca 02314]:
Next, a 1790 design by Stoupy Bijou
for an airship navigational system project… consisting of five balloons fastened to a sixty foot mast, a rudder, two 12 foot long oars, and two polygonal vanes to control the rise and fall of the airship. (Source: A.G. Renstrom, LC staff, 1981-82.) [Credit--Library of Congress, P&P Division LC-DIG-ppmsca-02516]:
Considerable progress had been achieved by the time of the 1878 ascent from Tuilleries, France, of Henry Giffard’s balloon [Credit--Library of Congress, P&P Division LC-DIG-cph 3a14342]:
During that same era, Albert Tissandier prepared these
five technical illustrations [that] show network of ropes and apparatus for securing multi-passenger platforms on captive balloons; arrangement of ropes for netting; and an elaborate hydrogen manufacturing and pumping station for inflating balloons [Credit--Library of Congress, P&P Division ppmsca-02510]:
Albert may have also drawn this skyscape of a lunar halo and luminescent cross he observed with his brother during their balloon Zénith’s long distance flight from Paris to Arcachon in March, 1875. The illustration appeared in his brother Gaston’s book, Histoire de mes Ascensions(1878) [Credit--Library of Congress, P&P Division ppmsca-07435]:

Interactive Metronome & IM-Home Blog
Get the latest news on Interactive metronome training, it's application and breakthroughs as well as insights in the science behind it and the latest tips and success stories from clients and therapist using IM and IM-Home..
Where I work, we use the Jebsen Test of Hand function prior to starting IM sessions so we can clearly see a right/left difference in a measurable way. The IM program itself has an assessment which his helpful as well. This makes it very easy for my patients and their families to see progress at the end of our time together.
One of the reasons I feel that I am able to see changes in these children so quickly is that they are reaching, grabbing, hitting, boxing, pressing switches through thousands of repetitions – not just the 10-20 reaching for this and that that we do in more traditional therapy. I also like it because I can decide if we are doing exercises with either both hands or just the affected one. We are able to help the brain forge new pathways that include the use of the affected side as well as pathways that tie both sides of the body together for improved bilateral coordination.
The flexibility of the IM program is great. We are able to design exercises to include weight bearing on the affected arm, crossing midline, reaching in any direction, elbow flexion and extension, wrist movement, finger movement, you name it! Many times even during a simple motion such as clapping, I have been able to observe their affected side begin to form a more symmetrical motion, which improves overall posture.
I also see improvement in the affected lower extremity. Muscle groups can be teased and focused, through the motions that you perform with the switches. Things like theraband or weights can be added for increased strength. Using the touch pad or gait with the feet to gain lower extremity coordination and a smoother gait pattern.
Functionally, this training has led to improved bilateral skills. Things such as buttoning pants, tying shoes, holding a paper when cutting with scissors, using a knife and fork to cut food, putting in a pony tail – all these things are easier to complete when you are able to use both sides of your body together to complete the task. Using Interactive Metronome as part of your therapy protocol to treat hemiplegia seems to be very affective and certainly worth the time and effort to give it a try.

Update, 7/6/12: The link for the New Scientist article referenced below seems to be inactive now. Most if not all of the original article remains below as I copied it. I found a similar article which references that of New Scientist: 6/19/12, "Climate panel slammed for embracing controversial 'grey literature' ," zeenews.india.com. It was filed from London.
The UN IPCC itself is washing its hands of being the arbiter of what does or doesn't qualify as man-caused catastrophic global climate warming. They now say they gladly accept 'grey' or non peer-reviewed material and that diversity is their first priority. According to this article, the United States no longer exists for UN IPCC purposes. "North America" is listed but the US is not mentioned separately. Which makes it even funnier that the US taxpayer picks up half the bills for the UN IPCC.

Great List
Yuri this is a really great collection of links. I don't think I've ever come across a link list specifically about writing titles before.
I know I've read a few of these already and they were all good so I'm looking forward to reading the rest.
Very impressive list! Spunn,
Very impressive list! Spunn, Stumbled & Dugg ;)
Nice work!
This is a fantastic list. I've given the URL to my friend who's great a pumping out good content for our new website (not launched yet) but is still trying to learn about this kind of stuff. Thanks :)
Thanks.
Considering the title is one of the most important elements of a page (both for humans and bots), I thought it'd make a good resource to compile a list of posts to work on them.
Now if more people voted for it on their social sites :)
Holy Comprehensive!
Wow. Very comprehansive list - thank you. Spunn.
Apparently, great content
Apparently, great content and title doesn't warrant instant success. Need some community to link to it, vote on social sites and so on ;)

Eric, I have said the same
Eric, I have said the same thing in the first sentence of this post.
However, the title is what is read about the post and that's why it needs to be attractive. This becomes absolutely obvious, once you play with social marketing some, where title [and description] is sometimes the only thing the social site members read before voting on the story.
Also, the title tag is the most important element on the page for the search engines, so at least having keywords in there will be helpful.
I Fully Agree
Yuri
I agree with you as well. I just wish I didn't have to spend so much time on things that take me away from content creation. Since I do, your article and links are definitely highly useful. Thanks for the all-in-one info on headlines and titles!

Canonicalization Issues
- "What?"
- "Ca-no-ni-ca-lization/canon-ica-lization/canonic-a-liz-ation issues."
It is when your website can be accessed with www and without www in front of it (such as improvetheweb.com and) and you, the visitors and the search engines are not redirected to only one version.
To the visitors, this doesn't matter a lot, unless they prefer to identify website addresses with 'www' or without (there are pros and cons of either approach).
The issue is that for the search engines, both versions are two different versions of the website, because the search engines index URLs, not websites as a whole.
Why is it a problem?
As the search engines see two websites, the number of pages with the same content doubles. As your visitors link to either of the versions randomly, both of them will have average amount of links.
Of course, the search engines will show one of the versions, but they will only count links that point to one of the versions, to which a specific page belongs to.
For example, if the page is, the search engines will count links that point to this page - most likely from the domain and sites that linked to that URL.
For the search engines to take into account all the links that point to your website (such as and), you need to redirect visitors and the search engines from one version to another.
Thus, the search engines won't be taking into account all your naturally acquired links and won't be showing your pages high in the SERPs as they rightfully deserve.
Why redirect?
By redirect the search engines to only one version of the site, we confirm their suspicion that we only have only one version of the website (not two different sites with similar content).
This way, they treat links to both www and non-www versions as links to one website and thus, which ever version you redirect to, gets a boost of incoming link value from the redirected version.
That's why you'll get more visitors from the search engines, which will lead to more customers, links and profit within a week or two (Google, others may be slower) by 10-15% (the speed relates to how fast the search engines react to the redirect and whether the version you redirect to is fully indexed).
If the version you are redirecting to is not indexed for one reason or another (except outright ban), you'll need to wait while Google and other SEs index the site and start taking all links into account.
This may take a week more or longer, depending on how large your site is. In this case, and if the version you are redirecting from is stronger (has more links), you may notice a slight drop of traffic, which will later return to normal and start increasing.
Even though the search engines tell us only to do what is right for the visitors and want us to ask ourselves "would I do it if the search engines didn't exist?", this particular improvement is designed to specifically help the search engines understand how our website works, also bringing more search engine visitors to the website.
So what to do?
Naturally, you need to only have one version by redirecting one of the site versions to another.
If you want a shorter domain and your customers will be able to memorize and identify your address with the web, then you can go without www.
However, if you want to make it clear that the address belongs to the Web, use the www version.
Opinions split on which one to use, really.
To redirect from one version to another, you either need to edit your httpd.conf file, if you use a dedicated server, or update your .htaccess file in the root of the domain.
Edit httpd.conf of Apache configuration
Ron Carnell suggests using two blocks in the httpd.conf file:
‹VirtualHost 192.xxx.xxx.xxx>
ServerName domain.com
DocumentRoot /home/domain/www
‹/VirtualHost>
‹VirtualHost 192.xxx.xxx.xxx>
ServerName
Redirect 301 /
‹/VirtualHost>
Basically, you only need to insert the correctly tweaked code in the corresponding part of your httpd.conf file (make sure you back it up first).
Please note that if you go this route, you'll need to tweak both parts, if one of the details changes.
If you are not familiar with the terminology and the whole process of fiddling with the Apache server, you'd rather designate this to your web admin.
If you read what Ron Carnell has said about this issue (you really should), you'll gain more insight why and how this is done.
Edit .htaccess in the domain root
But if you don't control the server, you can use the three lines of code:
How to redirect to www from non-www version:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yourdomain\.com [nc]
RewriteRule (.*) [R=301,L]
(replace yourdomain.com with your domain)
How to redirect from www version to non-www version:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^yourdomain\.com [nc]
RewriteRule (.*) [R=301,L]
(replace yourdomain.com with your domain)
Note: using .htaccess adds overhead to the server, since it'll be processed on every request to the server. However, large websites are bound to use dedicated servers, so it is pretty smooth here.
The .htaccess file is a file named .htaccess in the root of your domain. It has various directives used to tweak server performance. You can edit it, insert the corresponding three lines of code at the top of it (change yourdomain.com to your domain) and upload it back to the server.
To test this, you'll need to refresh the page in the browser. If everything loads fine and you can go from one version to another by entering the redirected URL, it works.
If you get a 503 error, you need to make sure you have inserted the code correctly. If you can't do this after repeated attempts, remove your edition to let the server work again and contact a professional.
You can also read a mod_rewrite manual from Apache about redirecting with .htaccess.
Conclusion
Frankly, it amazes how many sites I see often that don't redirect to only one of the versions, thus leaving plenty of money on the table. The thing is, the amount of money doesn't matter, because it takes a couple of minutes of work to implement the changes by the web developer.
And the funniest thing is that depending on the site total traffic, the profit increase can be very noticeable, comparable to general marketing activities, such as increase of conversions, promotions, etc.
You know I'm surprised at

Same here. It is so easy to check for it (type in both versions and see if either redirects to another) and so easy to implement, it is simply amazing.

We spent the last 7 days in Tennessee on a whirlwind wedding trip that turned into a full-length vacation, thanks to car trouble. No, not our own car trouble. We were going to hurry home so as not to miss a Texas visit by my Tennessee sis and her family, but their own car trouble kept them home, so we stayed longer than planned.
This gave the girls time to hit a few thrift stores and expand their collection.
While were there, I discovered that the old lady’s still got it: I jogged 3 miles nonstop. I guess I should confess that Perry and 2 of the girls were walking beside me while I jogged, so you can adjust your admiration and/or envy levels accordingly. Nonetheless, I was thrilled. This was the very sort of jogging that made me kiss the pavement in woozy despair last year, and I was sure I had lost the ability altogether after a full year of being a quitter. Now I’m jazzed – almost – about taking up jogging again.
In other news, I have proof that I am One Hot Mama. I may have slightly set fire to my bra. While wearing it. I blame the jogging, indirectly, because that caused me to be wearing a highly flammable cotton jogging bra and no nursing pads. I was using a hair blower to dry a milk spot, and got it a little too close. When I smelled smoke and saw the scorched spots, I decided it was dry enough. You never knew I was a bra burner, did you? Take that, patriarchy hating feminists!
Incidentally, Zulily has cotton nursing bras and camisoles on sale today 2/$11.99. Just in case you happen to have burned any lately and need replacements.

Because the issue is so important, and because Judge Magnus-Stinson took precisely the opposite position in her presentation on Blakely at the Judicial Conference at the end of September, I 'm going to pull out the argument regarding Blakely and consecutive sentences:
Blakely also affects other aspects of Indiana's felony sentencing system. Not only does the Code unconstitutionally permit trial courts to increase the sentence for one felony based on aggravating facts found by the judge alone, section 35-50-1-2 also permits trial courts to impose consecutive sentences for multiple felonies based upon that same determination. I.C. 35-50-1-2 ("The court may consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in IC 35-38-1-7.1(b) and IC 35-38-1-7.1(c) in making a determination under this subsection."). In Ortiz v. State, this Court reiterated that "[i]n order to impose consecutive sentences, a trial court must find at least one aggravating circumstance." 766 N.E.2d 370, 377 (Ind. 2002) (citing Jones v. State, 705 N.E.2d 452, 455 (Ind. 1999)). Thus, the imposition of consecutive sentences in Indiana, just like an increase of a sentence for one felony, is permitted under the Code only after the trial court -- not a jury -- makes a determination of fact. Because the end result of this practice is an increase in the maximum sentence a judge "may impose without any additional findings," Blakely, 124 S. Ct. at 2537 (alteration in original), the imposition of consecutive sentences based on judicially found aggravators is equally unconstitutional.
Footnote 3 also takes an interesting position about what to do after Blakely aggravators have been set aside:
Nevertheless, defendants retain the statutory right to present and argue mitigating circumstances at sentencing. See Ind. Code § 35-38-1-7.1(c). Trial courts are required to credit any proffered mitigating circumstances that are significant and clearly supported by the record. Dowdell v. State, 720 N.E.2d 1146, 1154 (Ind. 1999). If mitigating circumstances are found and no aggravating circumstances exist, a sentence below the presumptive must be imposed. See Laughner v. State, 769 N.E.2d 1149, 1167 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002), trans. denied.The State's response is due November 4th, and I hope to be able to put it up shortly thereafter.

NASA's 'Mohawk Guy' and 18 Other Famous Hairstyle Appropriators
The Curiosity, NASA's latest Mars rover, touched down on the Red Planet on August 6, and what was a pretty gee-whiz moment for science fans soon flared into a game of Who's That Guy?
"That Guy" was a NASA control-room knob-twiddler wearing a mohawk haircut, and since nobody knew who he was, he became "Mohawk Guy." Now, Mohawk Guy, real name Bobak Ferdowsi, is the nerd heartthrob who threatens to become a bigger story than the Curiosity.
So mainstream America has decided the mohawk is cool again. But does this hairstyle, other than its name, have anything to do with Mohawk Indians anymore? We asked Ray Cook, Mohawk, ICTMN's opinions editor, who told us the traditional warrior's hairstyle is better described as a "scalp lock." "The Mohawk is known as scalp lock because it makes it very hard for an enemy to lift one's hair for a trophy," he says. "But, on a practical note—we are a woodland people, bugs and ticks like to hide in lots of hair, a scalp-lock frustrates them too." Cook points to the paintings of Mohawk artist John Thomas as illustrations of the pre-Colonial Mohawk scalp lock.
It's significant that the subject of the painting is a lacrosse player wearing a scalp lock—Cook says the haircut is "for those who do battle. Which today means athletes." Wes Studi also wears a fairly authentic scalp lock as Magua in The Last of the Mohicans (and incidentally, in the UK, a mohawk haircut is known as a mohican):
The mohawk first gained popularity among non-Indians in modern times toward the end of World War II, when it was adopted by the "Filthy Thirteen," a unit of the 101st Airborne Division—and yes, the inspiration for the highly fictionalized 1967 film The Dirty Dozen. Sergeant Jake McNiece of Ponca City, Oklahoma, who is said to be of Native heritage, started the trend—according to a news article from 1994, he joked that it was a Native tradition, but really wore the haircut for sanitary reasons. Some of the members of the Filthy Thirteen followed suit, and a photograph of two mohawk-ed paratroopers applying face paint before a mission was published in Stars & Stripes. But the practice was not widespread.
Jazz musician Sonny Rollins went through a mohawk phase. In 2009, Rollins told NPR that "[t."
Military haircuts, though, are not far off from mohawks to begin with—particularly the high-and-tight and the extreme version of it known as a recon. Again we turn to Ray Cook, who served as a U.S. Marine in the mid-70s, who says it's another connection between the scalp lock and warrior culture. "The Marine Recon fought the scariest war of all," he says. "Behind enemy lines, undetected as much as possible. To the enemy they were a scourge, a ghost. And the enemy taking trophies of snipers and recon dead was well known, to prove the recon were merely enemy to be treated like dogs, to be proved mortal. So the Recons would do all they could to protect themselves...and to bring back their wounded, and their dead intact. Having a scalp lock might make you, or part of you, less likely to end up your enemy's trophy."
So it makes sense that an ex-Marine gearing up for a personal war might take a hairstyling cue from the recon boys—which is how the story unfolds in Taxi Driver. For Robert de Niro's Travis Bickle, the mohawk haircut is a signifier of his deluded transformation into a vigilante.
The next to take up the mohawk were punk rock musicians and their fans—Joe Strummer of The Clash grew a mohawk in the band's Combat Rock phase:
If you watched MTV during that same period you may remember two female singers who were also famous for their mohawks. One was Wendy O. Williams of the Plasmatics...
...and the other was Annabella Lwin, the teenaged singer of Bow Wow Wow, whose big hit was a remake of the song "I Want Candy":
The mohawk came back in the '90s; rockers recently wearing it include members of Rancid...
Adrian Young of No Doubt...
...and Travis Barker of Blink-182.
In 2010, Jamaican dancehall star and Grammy winner Sean Paul shocked his fans by doing away with his trademark cornrows in favor of a mohawk, which (for reasons unknown to us) he called a "speehawk":
The actor and wrestler Mr. T sported a mohawk that, along with copious gold jewelry, became his signature look, although he maintained that his hairstyle was inspired not by American Indians but by a photo of African Mandinka warriors in National Geographic.
The mohawk has also become popular among athletes—it's one of many hairdos David Beckham has experimented with:
Clint Mathis came out wearing a motivational mohawk for a game against South Korea in the 2002 World Cup. And perhaps it worked: He scored a goal in a 1-1 tie that proved adequate to get the American team out of the group stage.
In 2008, members of the Tampa Bay Rays wore mohawks—dubbed "Rayhawks"—as did many of their fans.
And now we have "Mohawk Guy" Bobak Ferdowsi (in case you are wondering about the name, it's Persian). Why a mohawk? Ferdowsi has explained that he gets a different, creative haircut for each mission, and this time around it happened to be a mohawk.
If it's all a bit distressing to see mohawks on so many non-Indian heads, perhaps a name change is in order. In 2003, a mummified Iron Age man, dead for some 2,300 years, was discovered in a bog near Clonycavan, Ireland. He was dubbed "Clonycavan Man," and his distinctive ridge of hair, held in place by plant oil and pine resin imported from the European mainland, has been referred to as "the world's first mohawk."
So perhaps these punks and jocks should all ditch their mohawks and instead grow clonycavans. As for a question asked earlier on this page—do Mohawks wear mohawks? Our Mohawk certainly does. "The scalp-lock is as popular today as ever," Ray Cook says. "I got mine on for the summer, and my five-year-old grandson gets his too, when I get mine."

World War II-Era Kodachromes
These images are stunning. Not only do they showcase a few of the millions of “Rosie the Riveters” who worked in the defense industry during this time, but they do so in such brilliant quality. Kodachrome film was first sold in 1935, but it was discontinued in 2009, though its legacy through photos like these (plus iconic images like “the Afghan Girl”) still lives.
Most of the images are from Shorpy, but they were compiled here, where many other lovely images of 1940s America can be found.
I wish Kodachrome still existed. Stunning photographs.

We are all familiar with the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. But in the case of bucket-filling, a positive reinforcement program that works well in classrooms, the Golden Rule should be revised to “Do unto others as they would have you do unto them,” in other words, treat people the way that they want to be treated, or treat them in ways that are valuable to them.
You’re probably thinking, How in the world can I treat 23 students individually and personally at any given time? Hold on! Essentially, all we are asking you to do is know your students. The more you know about what makes your students tick, the better able you will be to “fill their buckets. “
Dr. Donald O. Clifton’s book How Full is Your Bucket asserts that often it is what we recognize in others that actually helps them shape their identities and future accomplishments. Constantly referring to a child as funny, or shy, or outgoing can reinforce what that child thinks of him or herself. Teachers have the access and unique power—every day— to tell a child that he is a good writer, or a capable scientist, or an excellent athlete. These often unintentional individual recognitions, for better or worse, plant the seeds that can affect decision-making down the line. So make sure the seeds you plant are always for the better. (No pressure!)
The book outlines some key questions we’ve adapted for students to find out the best ways to fill their buckets:
1.By what name do you like to be called? Nickname?
2.What are your hot buttons—hobbies or interests you like to talk about a lot?
3.What makes you feel great when you’ve achieved something special? ●Receiving a certificate with your name on it? ●A prize? ●Note from teacher? ●Note from Mom, Dad or Grandparent? ●Announcement to the whole school over the PA system from the principal? ●Pizza for the whole class?
These insights can help teachers decide the best ways to fill their students’ buckets, to make recognition individual and meaningful whenever possible. Before long, you will see positive results in your classroom and you will have fostered a much more cooperative classroom climate.
Clifton reminds us that we all face a choice every single moment of every single day. We can fill one another’s buckets, or we can dip from them. The choices we make can profoundly influence our relationships, our health and our ability to be productive in the classroom or on the job. He cites a Gallup poll that estimates there are “…more than 22 million workers in the United States alone who are extremely negative or "actively disengaged." This rampant negativity is not only disheartening, it's expensive: It costs the U.S. economy between $250 and $300 billion every year in lost productivity alone.”
Let’s do our part by starting early and modeling for our students what positive behavior looks like and even sounds like. Before long, they will understand what it feels like to be a positive, productive person, and it can make all the difference in the world to your classroom community.
Begin the New Year on a positive note! Download our Guide to Successful Bucket-Filler Techniques and let your imagination be your guide on how to best introduce this concept to your students.

Technology is the modern frontier. It can be applied in every field of research and work. The advancements that have been made in the field of agricultural research have been extremely helpful and insightful. There are many lab uses for technology in agriculture, but the most common application so far is using information technology to help support the farmers. Agriculture would not exist without the farmers of America, so the use of GPS moisture probes has significantly changed the face of farming.
Fontanelle, an agriculture technology company, created the Aquaview GPS moisture probe and this was a large step in modern farming. Manually read and processed moisture probes have been around since the 1980’s. However, the Aquaview does not have to be manually checked every day; it is positioned in a flat central location in the field where the probes can be plunged into the ground, where they remain. The solar panel that powers the unit has to be positioned towards the southern sky, so it can soak up the maximum amount of sunlight. This unit stands alone in the field, but is connected to another piece of technology through satellite. The Aquaview GPS moisture probe sends the information that it collects through digital waves to a computer, iPad, of any other piece of technology that the farmer would use to read the information. This update came around in 2006, which just added to the world of hands free data collection.
Input hardware is involved in the functions of this moisture probe. The in-ground probes collect the data and send it up to the transmitter in the Aquaview unit. The information collected is sent up 3 conductor wires digitally. The input hardware in this course is the probe itself, it is considered to be a source data entry device which takes readable information (which is the moisture in centimeters or millimeters) and translates it into information that the computer can receive and understand. A computer processes information digitally but using 0’s and 1’s to portray the information that it needs to. Output hardware would be the actual monitor of a computer that displays the information in words for humans to comprehend.
The transmitter sends the data collected digitally to a computer that is set up to receive the information. The GPS is the server, where all of the information is sorted and redistributed according to location, the personal computer of the farmer is the client in this network. No matter where the farmer is, his data is delivered and updated every half hour. The nice thing about this set up is the farmer can be 400 miles away from his field and know whether his crops have enough water to sustain them in the heat or whatever the current circumstances are. At this point, the output hardware has been used to translate the 0’s and 1’s into humanized information.
My family began to use two of the Aquaview moisture probe units our land this past summer. The results were extremely impressive. The units are extremely accurate, and the freedom that it brought was very nice. We were able to pay more attention to the other fields that we had that did not have the Aquaview in them. It notifies your device of choice, in our case a laptop, and it alerts it when the field needs more water. It even can tell you how much water would be the best amount to apply. It was very nice to be able to track the moisture levels without having to walk out to the field yourself every day. When you have hundreds of acres the little break is appreciated where ever you can get it. All of the field that were monitored had a great yield and the Aquaview proved itself to be a great product for other farmers to put to use.
It is amazing how technology can be applied in every occupational field in the world. The furthering of science with technology is a great move in American agriculture. This not only helps to support the crops, but also the farmers. With the Aquaview, the monitoring of the water that the crops get will be much easier and less time consuming without the worry of having to check it frequently by actually walking out to the field. It also will hopefully teach good watering habits to young farmers that are learning about agriculture and the techniques to raising a good yield. In the future, there is potential for the Aquaview unit to be able to control when the irrigation comes on without the farmer having to do that himself. This could give more freedom to farmers, and maybe even the ability to farm more land. From the research aspect, it would be great to track the amounts of moisture the field needs for new hybrid plants to perform well.
This is the actual unit and how it would be positioned in a field of growing crops.

We caught some new work from Inhabitat favorite Jason D’Aquino. In addition to his famed matchbook miniatures, his signature black and white drawings were combined with vintage newspaper collages. Moira Fain’s modern collages fit somewhere in between D’Aquino and McClusky’s, using both vintage and contemporary paper as sources, in addition to fabrics, found notes, and old photographs.
Ellen Greene uses the feminine tradition of wearing white gloves with the masculine tattoo art. Combining purity, formality and rebellion, she decorates gloves with her own version of traditional flash art, creating a piece that brings high and low culture together.
A self proclaimed junk sculptor, Leo Sewell’s fascination in trash was inspired by the garbage he would see being hauled to the dump near his childhood home. His sculptures are composed of recognizable objects like cast-off metal, plastic and wood, which are fused together. Two animal sculptures, a favorite subject of his, were exhibited at the art fair.
Some historic collage was represented with C.T. McClusky’s circus-themed works, which combine original crayon drawing with clippings from popular magazines of the 1950s. Carlos DeMedeiros’ former life as a monk in Bolivia is evident in the Brazilian artist’s work. The mini confessionals are made from found materials which are assembled in colorful tableaus.
What could at first resemble a day at the shooting range, Racine Polycarpe’s sculptures are a carefully organized collection of tin cans. Punctured with holes of different sizes, they are arranged in a grid and encased in a rustic frame of found wood. Their perfect organization transforms the used cans into a work of art.
The Outsider Art Fair celebrates artists on the fringes of the art world, showing that artistic talent is not always something that can be taught with formal education.

Has anyone else out there in INNOPAC land ever experienced intermittant
dropping of telnet sessions? Actually, in our case it is not exactly
intermittant, it is every Saturday morning between 8 AM and approximately 1
PM ; random times on Sundays; and though it has not ever failed on a
Monday before, yesterday (Labor Day) it did.
Our server is in the largest of 10 connected consortium libraries.
The other libraries are connected to it via Frame-Relay T-1
Each library is on it's own subnet.
The carrier for the T-1s stress tested one of the circuits at the
time it was failing and found no abnormalities.
This problem does not affect the library where the server is located. (same
subnet)
Traffic to the OPAC/WebOPAC is not affected.
We have a caching DNS server to which INNOPAC points. The problem was there
before this server was installed, and didn't go away after it was installed.
It SEEMS like the problem should be in the common connection between the
server and the 'remote' locations, but all other services pass through normally
(http, ftp, etc). But only on weekends? And now holidays as well. I'm
stumped.
Anyone?

Lots of interesting gossip and rumors floating around these days about Linux Networx and something big in the air for them this week.
I’ve been pumping my friends and irritating those I don’t know very well for the past 24 hours trying to find a quorum opinion on exactly what, and so far I don’t have one.
What I have found is reflected in a comment on this post left by an insideHPC reader on the web site today:
This week, they are going through some BIG changes, sell off/Merger or even a Complete shutdown [capitalization courtesy of the commenter]
I hear the same things. On the sale I hear that possible buyers include one of the “smaller” HPC companies, outfits like Rackable or Penguin.
I feel obligated to remind you at this point in the post that I have a terrible record with rumors. But then, so does everyone else.

CHAPEL HILL - Third-ranked North Carolina got four goals from Kara Cannizzaro and three from Abbey Friend on its way to an 11-9 win over fourth-ranked Florida on Saturday afternoon at Fetzer Field in the season opener for both teams. The Tar Heels improve to 1-0 with the victory and won their first game of the season for the seventh year in a row. Florida falls to 0-1 with the defeat.
In addition to the scoring output of Cannizzaro and Friend, Carolina also got a goal and an assist from All-America Laura Zimmerman and single goals from Emily Garrity, Taylor George and Brittney Coppa. Becky Lynch had an assist.
For the Gators, Kitty Cullen scored three goals and dished out an assist. Ashley Bruns scored three times and Brittany Dashiell had a goal and an assist. Florida also got goals from Gabi Wiegand and Caroline Chesterman.
Lauren Maksym played well in the cage for Carolina, recording 10 saves in picking up her first win of the year. Mikey Meagher started in goal for Florida and gave up seven first-half goals before giving way to Cara Canington in the second half.
Florida grabbed a 2-0 lead in the opening few minutes on a pair of free position goals in the opening 2:02 of the game. Carolina rallied to score three consecutive goals to take a 3-2 lead and force a Gator timeout. Friend had two of the three Tar Heel goals during the run. Florida responded with a goal on an extra man opportunity to tie it back up at three apiece with 17:07 left in the first half.
The Tar Heels closed the first half with a 4-0 run to take command 7-3 at the break. Cannizzaro scored the last two of those goals, the second of which came with under one second left on the first half clock.
Garrity scored coming out of the lockerroom for an 8-3 Tar Heel lead, their biggest of the game. The teams traded mini-scoring rallies the rest of the way with Florida getting as close two goals at 10-8 with 9:14 to go.
Cannizzaro scored an unassisted insurance goal for UNC with 6:28 to go that made it 11-8. Bruns eventually scored her third goal with 2:49 to go to make it an 11-9 final.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. - The second-seeded and 12th-ranked Loyola University Maryland women’s lacrosse team rallied to knock off third-seeded and sixth-ranked Notre Dame, 11-9, Thursday evening in the semifinals of the 2012 BIG EAST Championships at the Carrier Dome.
The Greyhounds (12-5, 7-1 BIG EAST) scored six of the game’s nine second-half goals to erase a one-goal halftime deficit en route to the victory.
"I’m extremely impressed by the fight that we had today after going into halftime down one," head coach Jen Adams said. "Notre Dame is a phenomenal team and you have to give them a whole lot of credit. They made our job very tough today. I’m very proud of our girls to be able to gut it out and stick it out against a very tough and athletic Notre Dame side. We were able to find the right opportunities in the second half and limit them and their high-powered offense. I think we showed some true character and I’m very proud of the effort we put in today."
Sophomore Marlee Paton led the way with a game-high six points on four goals and two assists, while junior Joanna Dalton tied a career-high four goals. Junior Kathleen Barranco, in addition to freshmen Kara Burke and Hannah Schmitt, also tacked on goal each for Loyola.
For Notre Dame (13-4, 6-2), Jenny Granger had two goals and two assists, while Maggie Tamasitis added two goals and one assist. Five other Irish had one goal each.
The Greyhounds traded goals with the Fighting Irish throughout the first half, with Notre Dame getting on the board first at the 29-minute mark. Paton quickly knotted the score though, firing a shot into the back of the net just 19 seconds later.
Notre Dame regained the lead with a goal at 25:35, but Dalton had an answer for the Greyhounds, scoring on an assist from Paton at 24:10. It wouldn’t be enough to quiet the Irish though, as they tallied back-to-back goals to take a 4-2 lead with 12:33 on the clock.
Dalton ripped a shot from about 10 yards out to bring Loyola within one at 8:48 and the Greyhounds had an opportunity to it at four when senior Kellye Gallagher forced a turnover and sent it ahead to a wide-open Annie Thomas, but a turnover sent the ball back to Notre Dame’s end, where Granger scored her second of the day to give the Irish a 5-3 lead.
Schmitt scored the game’s next goal, dodging her way through the defense and sticking a shot into the top right corner at 4:14, but Notre Dame notched its sixth goal with 3:08 to play.
The Fighting Irish looked to extend its lead to three right before the half, but senior goalkeeper Kerry Stoothoff saved their shot and Annie Thomas found Barranco open in front of the goal with five ticks left to bring the Greyhounds within one, 6-5, at the break.
Burke scored her sixth goal of the season at 26:43 to tie the game at six, before Paton gave Loyola its first lead of the day at 22:14, scoring a man-up goal, assisted by Sydney Thomas.
Notre Dame marked its first goal of the second half at 21:36 to tie the game for a fourth time, before Paton and Sydney Thomas connected for Loyola’s second-straight goal at 19:32.
The Irish found its equalizer 30 seconds later, before the Greyhounds scattered three goals within the next 11 minutes to earn an 11-8 advantage at the 7:45 mark. Dalton started the streak with a free position goal, before ripping a shot on a feed from Schmitt at 14:15. Paton then took a pass from Schmitt and spun around a defender before finding the back of the net at 7:45.
Notre Dame halted the streak at 4:42 when the Irish caused a turnover in transition and scored on an unsettled possession. The Fighting Irish looked to add a second goal, but Stoothoff turned back two shots to keep Notre Dame off the board.
Stoothoff then came up with another huge save in the final minute of the game to finish with eight saves and preserve the 11-9 victory for the Greyhounds.
Defensively, senior Ana Heneberry, Gallagher and Paton all had three caused turnovers, while Stoothoff had a game-high six ground balls and Heneberry scooped up three.
Dalton and Sydney Thomas each won three draw controls for the Greyhounds.
Loyola will return to action on Saturday when it faces the winner of the No. 1 seed Syracuse vs. No. 4 seed Georgetown game in the title game of the BIG EAST Championships. Opening draw is scheduled for 1 p.m. at the Carrier Dome.

Of course, in fantasy football, I'm guessing the trends don't look anything like that. Yes, you've started your season 0-1 and you think this is a "must-win" situation, but it really isn't. There's plenty of time and -- guess what? -- there is no actual momentum in fantasy! I've started 0-5 before and still made the playoffs. If your team has good players on it, trust it for another month. I'm not saying you don't make moves and tinker, but nobody should be panicking unless they really do have an awful team with Ricky Williams, Le'Ron McClain and Beanie Wells as the best choices for the starting running back slots. Hey, I got an e-mail from someone this week stating just that, and he wanted to know if he was in trouble. Yes! In that case you are in trouble. Get ready for fantasy basketball season!
Here are some of the overriding trends I see for our fine fantasy sport heading into a very interesting Week 2, and obviously I want to keep them different from the rankings issues I discussed in Wednesday's blog, so you won't see our top-projected waffling quarterback mentioned here. You know who he is.

R.I.P. my camera, which died just after I finished taking yesterday’s pictures. I’ve got to get a new one ASAP!! I discovered today that a couple of my lantana plants are starting to send up shoots–which means, spring is really springing!!

While driving around a couple of days ago I heard a public service announcement for either the Boys’ and Girls’ Clubs or The Big Brother program, I forget which one. Anyway, guess who was delivering the PSA? Laura Bush! Which got me thinking…I’m wondering when we start hearing from Michelle Obama? I wonder what causes she will lend her services to?? Or is she too busy visiting all the governmental agencies so she can deliver hubby’s message of hope and change?

Truth is Gold had a really excellent post up on Friday called Lest We Pay the Price Too Dear…Learn From History!
An excerpt, with permission:
I cross post today an urgent message, gleaned from three very well informed journalists who know their history well. Urgency dictates that I introduce them and furnish you with the links from which to read their messages in entirety.
The first, by Eric Margolis, reminds us of Afghanistan’s solid history of making mincemeat out of its invaders, from Alexander the Great in 327–325 BC, to the Soviets in 1989, disasters all.
In the second, Kevin Barrett reveals in OpEdNews’s “Obama: Political Messiah, or Just Another Third World Dictator?” the facts behind the most recent resident of our White House and cites Webster Tarpley’s work in detail, Tarpley being among the foremost political and historical researchers of our time. Further research has substantiated the fact that indeed, Tarpley’s work is almost faultless in terms of his list of players and the historical context in which they exist.
The third of this terrifying trilogy is Christopher Bollyn’s work on Obama’s new budget director Peter R. Orszag.
SNIP.

Read the whole post. Read about his links to Robert E. Rubin, Clinton’s Secretary of the Treasury and recently resigned head of Citigroup. It isn’t looking good…
By the way, the Central Bank of Iceland just hired an interim governor, an economist from Norway. One of the former governors of the CBI who was asked to resign has been offered a job at….the Norwegian Central Bank. And, a possible snag?
“Law professor Sigurdur Líndal told Fréttabladid that he doubts a foreign citizen can be hired to the position, explaining that the constitution states that no one can become a public official in Iceland without holding the Icelandic citizenship.”

There’s that “citizenship thing” again…

Here’s some more news that will cheer you up…not. Let’s catch up with some of China’s latest moves. How will this play out?
First, China is on the prowl, looking to buy foreign oil companies. From The Telegraph:
CHINA PREPARES TO BUY UP FOREIGN OIL COMPANIES
China is preparing to open a new phase in its race for the world’s resources by using its huge currency reserves to buy foreign oil and gas companies.
SNIPA conference of officials from the National Energy Administration has agreed to consider establishing a special fund for China’s state-owned companies to buy oil and gas firms overseas. The beneficiaries would be the Beijing’s three giant energy companies – Petrochina, Sinopec and CNOOC.

While visiting RBO, I happened to see this ANNOUNCEMENT about America’s new name, Barackistan.
New! Congratulations to Cinie of Cinie’s World who has found the perfect title for the leader of Barackistan — “Just Barely President, Baracus Hubris Maximus (hail Ceasar!)”. Psst! Baracus Ceasar Obamacus is good, too.
Thanks to Insight Analytical‘s Grail Guardian, America will be referred to as Barackistan and all you little former free-thinking, openly-voting Americans as Barackistanis.
RBO couldn’t think of any more fitting name for the White House/West Wing/Congress than Barackistan HQ.
Any questions?

Another great post from the Brainy Gamer about No More Heroes, comparing Suda 51 to the auteurs of the French New Wave. Without having seen, well, any of the films mentioned, I think I'm still on board with that thesis.
To gank a thought from my review, it seems to me that the amount of money and effort it takes to make a big-time console game these days practically requires design by committee. Too many people are involved in every level of the process -- from the artists, to the sound guys, to the suits sweating every nickel and dime -- for one person's vision to make the leap from conception to reality. Lots of good and even great games come out every year, but most of them lack that stamp of individuality, even if the graphics are polished and the online play is stutter-free. BioShock seemed to have that singular inspiration driving it, but apparently most of the storyline only came together near the end. With No More Heroes, you really get the impression that you're playing a game that has sprung, intact, from the deepest recesses of Suda 51's mind. While it's not as polished as a lot of games, that's a point in its favor. (See Leigh's comments on this post.) Frankly, I can't believe this game got made.
Right now, Roger Ebert's review of The 400 Blows is featured on his web site. At the top is this quote from Truffaut: "I demand that a film express either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not at all interested in anything in between." No More Heroes, it could be said, expresses the joy of making games. Or maybe the agony of making games. Certainly, it revels in the joy of playing games.

Hi Mitch. I'm glad you enjoyed my post. I'm taken by your observation that too many cooks may be spoiling the game design soup these days, and I'm wondering if the same can be said of film these days (or at least some films).
Totally rough calculation here, but I think if you took all the Oscar nominated films this year and examined the lists of people who worked on those films - and then did the same for the films nominated 5 or 10 years ago - you would discover that some of the best films today are being made by "auteurist" directors like Tamara Jenkins, Julian Schnabel, Julie Taymor, and the Coen Bros with fewer producers and studio types involved in the process.
This may be a half-baked theory, but I think there's something to it that reinforces your notion that singular inspiration is a powerful thing.
I certainly think there's something to the notion, although I'm hesitant to go too far out on the limb and start drawing broad conclusions. We tend to associate filmmakers more closely with movies than we do game developers with their games. But making movies is still a collaborative process, even for the directors you mentioned. Even somebody like Robert Rodriguez, who writes, directs, shoots, edits, and scores his own movies, still has to work with dozens of cast and crew. And yet I can tell a Robert Rodriguez movie when I see one. I can tell a Paul Thomas Anderson movie, a Wes Anderson movie, even a Michael Bay movie. Their stamps tend to be indelible.
How many game designers can you say that about? Hideo Kojima, Shigeru Miyamoto, maybe now Suda 51. The list is short, anyway.
Along those lines, I was struck by a comment Gus Mastrapa made on a post Chris Dahlen wrote about Burnout Paradise:
"I’ve always taken issue with the Burnout series’ reticence to commit to a style, position or even attitude. The worlds are always kinda bland, generic even. The radio hosts are usually suicide inducing. The crashes and racing are awesome, but the setting is so non-committal that it irks me for some reason. Who gets the opportunity to make a world and fashions something so utterly devoid of character?"
I read that and thought immediately of No More Heroes. By any measure, Burnout is the more polished and "professional" of the two games. Its open world is seamless. But the game lacks any kind of a voice or point of view. It doesn't possess an ounce of the character that Santa Destroy has. My instinct is to attribute that difference to the vision of Suda 51.
If I were to try to draw one lesson from this thought exercise, it's that sharing the creative process among a large group will tend to dilute what we'd call the artistic vision. It takes a strong, singular voice to succeed spectacularly -- and, probably, to fail spectacularly, which is why the money men are afraid to foster those voices. No doubt there are countless counterexamples, though, which is why I'm not convinced we've stumbled on to something too big here.
Hmm, this seems like it should probably become its own post, though.
Well, I did say "at least some films," [grin]
I'm not claiming any kind of seismic shift in the film industry, but I do think indie films--which have exerted far more influence on filmmaking than indie games have had on games--have created a broader acceptance in the film industry for maverick creators at this particular moment. I see some interesting parallels between American cinema in the 70s and some of what we're seeing now.
I have to disagree with you about games lacking the kind of signature style that you associate with certain filmmakers. To me, it's very easy to discern an Atlus game, a Sega game, a Capcom game, and a Grasshopper game. They each have very distinctive features and stylistic signatures. Yes, they can't necessarily be traced to a specific designer, but I think their distinctiveness is no less pronounced.
Apologies for another film analogy, but to me video games are like the cinema during the studio era in this regard. MGM films looked very different from Warner Bros. films, which looked very different from Paramount or RKO. I highly recommend a book called "The Genius of the System" which is a terrific account of how the collaborative, factory-like system of filmmaking in the 30s managed to generate such singular, artistically distinctive films.
It doesn't, in my view, always require a single genius at the helm to create a work of surpassing excellence...but if often helps!
Thanks for such a thought provoking conversation, Mitch. It's fun to think hard about this stuff.

What for each of us. Your family may have the ability to take care of you. You might have the financial resources to pay for in-home care or the cost of a stay in a care facility. Or perhaps you know that Medicaid will need to fund any care you receive.
If your financial situation is between very wealthy and limited resources, consider long term care insurance. A long term care insurance policy pays for care if you need assistance with two "activities of daily living," which are defined as dressing, eating, toileting, bathing, transferring (moving from one place of rest to another) and continence. or are diagnosed with cognitive impairment and have a doctor certification that you will require care for at least 90 days.
Many people say they'd rather take their chances that they won't need long term assistance and that they'll be able to afford it if they do. But what does that mean in dollars and cents? According to Genworth Financial, a private room in a nursing home in Colorado Springs can cost in excess of $85,000 a year. If you are married, your care could decimate the nest egg that you and your spouse have if your nursing home stay lasts for a year or more.
Long term insurance policies are relatively new in the insurance industry and continue to evolve. Rather than a "one size fits all" solution, you can make some choices regarding features to lower the cost of the policy. For instance, most policies allow you to have care in your home, have the amount paid for care keep up with cost of living increases, share the benefit with a spouse, and have the benefit paid in cash rather than to those providing assistance. If you don't pick all of these features, the cost is less to you and reflects your preferences. In many cases, the annual premium for a policy like this can be the same as the cost of one or two months of nursing home care.
I generally recommend that folks get coverage in their 50s. But if you're over that age, it's still worth exploring. If you decide to get a policy, talk to an insurance professional who works with several companies. That agent will be able to recommend a company that will have the best value for your medical history. Discuss with the agent the quality rating of the insurance company. You don't want to pay years of premiums, then have your benefits be unavailable because your company went out of business. And don't buy a policy during your first meeting. It's a big enough financial commitment that you should be able to think it over before writing a check.

Great post here. I’d like to extend the commentary to ask what the author would think about interaction design for telling stories (e.g. Storytelling in video games). One of the central goals for making a fun and engrossing game, in my opinion, is creating a compelling story. The story can only be accomplished through the use of technology and the player’s progression through the many levels the design team has made for the player. But what if the interaction design of the game is so poor that the user cannot become one with the story? What if the controls completely frustrate the user to the point that even the best story becomes intolerable? I can point to many examples of this situation, but I am curious as to hear what your thoughts are. #win epic epicness – Casey

Hi, Casey!!!
I totally agree with your comment and the questions you pose. Someone from telecom who took the class the same semester I did just recently posted on facebook that started her own game studio (monsterandglitch.com). Her first blog post was pretty cool. Here’s the link and text:
From what I’ve seen on her site, it seems like she trying to address some of those questions that you’ve brought up. Pretty cool to think about how this class has and is influencing the design of games, etc!

This makes me think about something Wong has said about this film. It’s something like this: “In my earlier films, people feel so lonely and they don’t know how to get along with this loneliness. However, in this film, people get a way to get along with this loneliness, and even make fun of it.”
So this makes me think about ubiquitous design. Currently I’m living in an apartment with only one roommate, and usually we don’t talk with each other. Although I love being alone, sometimes I need to figure out how to get along well with my solitude and my nostalgia. So every time I feel homesick or lonely, I will just cook food. How can designers design something in kitchen that will make me feel better of this? That would be very very interesting, indeed.

Nickel and dimed at Bowdoin College
In an attempt to convince skeptical Brunswickians that Bowdoin students have, indeed, looked up from their Solo cups long enough to realize that the economy is in the shitter, Barry Mills started a book club. It’s called “The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society” and…wait, hold on *shuffles notes*
It’s called “Brunswick-Bowdoin Community Read” and the book of the month is “Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America” by Barbara Ehrenreich, who decided to try and live on 1 minimum wage job to see if it was possible…it’s not really, though it is the harsh reality for many Americans.
Book discussions coincide with Mills’ decision to reform Bowdoin’s financial aid policies to better accommodate the needs of middle income families…wait, never mind…*shuffles notes*
The book discussions coincide with a Common Hour visit by the author herself at 12:30 p.m., Friday, January 27, in Pickard Theater, Memorial Hall.

We got some very good news recently about the twenty million adults in this country who were born here and are the children of immigrants. A comprehensive report from the Pew Research Center finds that this second generation is doing significantly better than today’s first-generation immigrants in terms of education, home ownership rate, percentage living below the poverty line, and median income. Surprisingly, the second generation even matches the economic success of Americans overall, while graduating from college at higher rates than the U.S. average. (This reflects the high college-graduation rate of Asian Americans, who make up a larger proportion of second-generation immigrants than the general population).
Additionally, the Pew survey found that, compared to immigrants, second generation Americans have much higher percentages that are proficient in English (including nine-tenths of both Hispanic and Asian Americans), are more likely to have friends and marry outside the boundaries of their ancestral group, to believe that relations between their group and other Americans are good, and to consider themselves a “typical American.” (To clarify, this survey is not comparing second-generation immigrants and their own parents, but today’s entire adult population of immigrants within two generations of arriving in America.) In another interesting finding, three-quarters of first and second generation Hispanic and Asian Americans believe that hard work is enough to ensure success in most cases, compared to 58 percent of Americans overall. Both generations of both ethnic groups are also more politically liberal and less Republican-leaning than the general population, countering the myth that conservatives have a monopoly on the belief in hard work.
One of the great fallacies expressed by some in the immigration debate today is that contemporary immigrants just aren’t assimilating or Americanizing in the way the “good old” immigrants did in the Ellis Island generations of the early twentieth century. Some of that, of course, reflects nostalgia for those immigrants, who are in many cases the grandparents or great-grandparents of the people expressing such a belief. The reality, as this Pew report and other similar studies make clear, is that the post-1965 immigrants are doing their part. By the second generation, they are learning English, and not just those from Asia but those from Spanish-speaking countries as well (typically, the criticism that immigrants and their children aren’t learning English and aren’t integrating is aimed at Hispanic Americans). They are identifying in large numbers not only as Americans but as “typical Americans,” and they are marrying and having friends outside their ethnic group in numbers even larger than the overall population.
There have long been, and will continue to be, anti-immigration activists who stoke fears about separatist immigrants and the Balkanization of our society, especially as our population continues to grow less and less white.. In my next post I’ll be writing some more about the issues of integration and “Americanization” and how this country approached them in the early twentieth century. But this report from Pew about second-generation immigrants truly is welcome. It confirms that even as our immigrant population has shifted from being overwhelmingly European to predominantly Asian and Hispanic in origin, we are continuing to succeed in integrating newcomers in our culture as well as our economy.
One of the most valuable things America can do is show the world that a society made up of people from every corner of the globe — where in a generation or two no race will be a majority — can be a place where people can choose to preserve their ancestral cultures even as they truly become one people as Americans. We can serve as an alternative model to societies that reject pluralism, that look to suppress dissent and diversity because their majority believes its culture or beliefs are the only acceptable ones. One report doesn’t mean the task has been accomplished. But it does mean that, on an issue of paramount importance for us and for the world, we are on our way.

China loves a crisis

21st September, 2012
Wanting Chinese investment is one thing; needing it is another. As the euro-zone crisis has deepened, one of the counter-intuitive outcomes thus far has been the increased investment by Chinese companies and the central government into European assets. The Rhodium Group, a New York-based research firm that tracks outbound Chinese investment into North America and Europe, published a study this month that showed how significant this increased investment has been.

Governor Rell’s Proposals for Retirement Costs Are a Classroom Exercise in Political Campaigningby Matt O'Connor on September 7th
Leaders of the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition (SEBAC) today described Governor M. Jodi Rell’s announced proposals for reducing unfunded pension and healthcare liabilities as political grandstanding at its most cynical.
Said Council 4 AFSCME Executive Director Sal Luciano, who sits on the State Post-Employment Benefits Commission, “From the beginning, I had concerns that Governor Rell would mislead the public, and she’s done exactly that. By failing to differentiate between State employee pension tiers, and failing to address the OPEB liability that Executive Order 38 was supposed to address, she turned what could have been a constructive policy recommendation into a cynical political document.”
Added Luciano, “Governor Rell is not interested in helping the middle class face the real retirement crisis affecting most Connecticut workers. She has just offered up empty rhetoric before her commission has even taken a vote on final recommendations.”
Governor Rell is already on track to leave behind her a legacy of economic devastation, home foreclosures and terrible human suffering. To distract from the fact that neither she nor her hoped for successor have any realistic plan or program to solve the real problems of the middle class, she has now put forward a series of proposals which both break her binding promise to 45,000 working families, and would not create a single job or help a single community. If adopted, they would only further delay our economic recovery.
Said CSEA/SEIU Local 2001 Executive Director Robert Rinker, “Governor Rell has shown that she’d rather play politics than put forward real solutions for Connecticut middle class families. But she has also shown that she’s not interested in dealing with the state pension and retiree healthcare plans’ unfunded liabilities. If she were, the governor would have recommended using some of last year’s budget surplus to reverse recent pension fund deferrals to the unfunded liability. Instead, she called for cancelling bonding in the current year’s budget, which produces far less bang for the taxpayers’ buck.”
Added Rinker, “The governor’s representatives who negotiated a nearly $1 billion cost savings agreement last year didn’t put forward changes like she has presented here; they couldn’t with a straight face. Instead, she waited until an election year in order to offer up talking points for Tom Foley’s campaign for governor.”
The coalition’s leaders look forward to working with a new administration in an honest and concerted effort to help solve the real problems that confront the people of the state. Working together, elected leaders, business leaders of good faith, and Connecticut’s middle class both in the public and the private sectors, can help build a future where every family has a chance for a decent job, with decent benefits, and a safe and dignified retirement.
Council 4 and CSEA are two of the thirteen unions in the State Employee Bargaining Agent Coalition (SEBAC), which serves to unite approximately 45,000 Connecticut State Employees to address issues of common concern. To learn more about the coalition’s campaign for a fair budget and a livable state with great public services visit.

What happens when you combine the heavy dubstep force of Starkey with the artful creativity of Bassnectar? You get a great remix! Philadelphia native Starkey released his song “Street Rockers” back in 2011, via his EP Space Traitor, Vol. 2, and Bassnectar, or Lorin Ashton, has absolutely breathed new life into the track. But as one of the most popular artists in the EDM scene, with albums like Divergent Spectrum, Vava Voom, and more recently his Freestyle EP under his belt, Bassnectar is never one to disappoint.
Ashton starts off by revamping the beginning of the track, having it go immediately into hard-hitting dubstep, and continues changing things up towards the middle by switching the arrangement and adding in more distinct drops. Closer to the end, Ashton uses brief pauses in the song and injects tons of extra energy to distinguish his remix from the original, as well as eliminating the sticky liquid feel during the beginning and end. Listen to Bassnectar’s remix of “Street Rockers” below, and download it for free here!

I recently wrote a column on the froth in the technology sector, highlighting 3 tech stocks to sell and 2 tech stocks to buy[1]. The winners? Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL[2]) and medical software stock Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN[3]). The losers? Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN[4]), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT[5]) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX[6]).
As usual, a number of readers dropped me a line to disagree — but one tech expert made such a strong case in favor of Seagate that I thought it was worth revisiting and giving the other side of the story.
Mark Miller[7] is a senior research analyst at Noble Financial Capital Markets and has more than a decade of experience covering the disk drive business, including companies like Seagate, Western Digital (NYSE:WDC[8]) and Veeco (NASDAQ:VECO[9]), among others. And he says popular perceptions about the move away from solid state drives to flash technology are overblown — and that disk drive stocks have been unfairly punished for flooding last year that affected operations.
I caught up with Mark to get more details on some of the reasons he is bullish on the disk drive sector generally, and the reasons that Noble Financial has a buy on STX and $35 target price:
Q: You contend that disk drives are far from a fading technology, and that there’s still a growing market. What are the most telling stats you think investors should know about these companies or this sector?
A: The demand for storage is growing at annual rate of 40%, and market research firm IDC[10] just projected a compounded annual growth rate of 9% for drive sales from 2011-16. Flash memory only comprises about 5% of total mass storage requirements this year. While the amount of flash-based storage will grow, with 40% growth in required storage, the flash manufacturers can’t add fab capacity fast enough to take significant share from hard drives.
Q: In the short term, a lot of folks seam bearish about drive stocks simply due to seasonality. You don’t buy that argument. Why?
A: Seasonality simply doesn’t apply. Typically, the June quarter is seasonally weak and investors lose interest in the stocks. Because shipments are scaling back up from recent floods in Thailand[11], the drive industry is expected to post sequentially stronger results for the June quarter. We don’t see a return to normal conditions until the September quarter. Due to the flood, we estimate by the end of this year there will be cumulative unmet demand of 135-150 million units. With drive demand averaging 170-175 million units a quarter versus an estimated industry capacity of 190-195 million units by the end of this year, it will be well into 2013 before things are finally balanced.
Q: In the longer term, many are convinced that flash memory and cloud storage will steadily supplant hard drives. Without getting too technical, what are the practical drawbacks preventing this from happening anytime soon?
A: Flash will have a place, but until costs come down it will still be niche technology. The current storage capacity in a laptop drive is 500 GB. The Intel 600 GB solid-state drive (SSD) is selling for over $1,000, which is about three times the cost of a low-end laptop PC. Market studies show that tablets, which typically contain just 64 GB or less of NAND flash storage, are only cannibalizing about 20% of potential drive sales. So for 80 million tablet shipments, that comes to 16 million lost drive sales — or about 2% of total projected drive shipments for this year. To reduce storage costs for SSDs, you need to go to multilayer-cell (MLC) NAND flash, but MLC NAND flash has far worse data reliability issues than the more expensive single-layer-cell (SLC) flash. So you either use expensive SLC NAND flash or run the risk of using MLC flash.
Q: If there’s no immediate risk of obsolescence, do you think solid state drives will eventually become obsolete in the next few decades — or will they be around until 2099?
A: Both solid-state and hard drives will coexist for the foreseeable future, with hard drives still comprising a dominant share of high-capacity storage applications. I think for mass-storage applications, the industry will move to hybrid drives, which employ flash in conjunction with a hard drive. In order to meet the $600 price point consumers expect for computers, I expect hybrid drives will be the primary storage device in ultrabooks. Due to their significantly higher input/output capabilities, which mitigates the cost disadvantage, I see the biggest opportunity for SSDs being certain enterprise storage applications.
Q: You call drive stocks the “Rodney Dangerfields” of the tech space. What are a few unsung stocks you think investors should take a closer look at for their portfolios, and why?
A: Investors are being too paranoid about the effects of the flood. They are missing the power of the recent consolidation moves in the industry, and growing worldwide demand for storage. We modeled both Seagate and Western Digital after their respective mergers — with pre-flood drive ASPs and margins — and came up with a post-recovery earnings range of $5.75 to $6.60, sans flood effects. Historically, these stocks trade in a forward P/E range of 7 to 11. Not only are they cheap, but we have them generating impressive free cash flows over the next two years — $5 to $6 billion — which can be used to buy back shares or pay a higher dividend. We also believe drive suspension supplier Hutchinson Technology (NASDAQ:HTCH[12]) is on the verge of a major turnaround.
Editor’s Note: HTCH is a microcap stock that trades on very thin volume, and a very aggressive stock. Do not consider a trade for any equity of this nature without using a limit order to protect your entry price.
Q: Even if your logic is sound on the strength of the drive industry and these individual stocks, do you have fears that, generally speaking, we are seeing a lot of overbought tech stocks? Should investors wait for a pullback, or do you think now is the time to get in despite dramatic run-ups in the last few weeks?
A: Certainly with STX trading at a P/E of 3.1 on FY13 consensus numbers and WDC at a P/E of 4.8, we don’t see either as overextended. Even with the post-flood recovery, estimates sans flood effects, the stocks are still cheap. Yes, STX is up from high single digits in October, but that low valuation was far more irrational than today’s price. We are projecting upside in the March reports for both Seagate and Western Digital. We also see several upside factors for STX longer-term, including the ramp of eight, new lower-cost products, reduced warranty costs which cut into this quarter, the internal supply of heads and media to Samsung drives which improves gross profits by $4 per drive, the hybrid drive opportunity and the improving macroeconomic picture.
Q: Any final thoughts to share that we haven’t covered?
A: Investors need to look beyond the flood and understand the long-term benefits of the recent industry consolidation moves in conjunction with the world’s ever-growing appetite for storage., Jeff did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Tuesday the “Big Three” U.S. automakers released their August sales figures—and the results may surprise you. Despite the fact that consumers are still skittish about the larger economy, each of these three companies posted robust sales growth for the month of August. It has been some time since I have revisited the U.S. auto industry, so let’s dig into the details and see whether there are any profit opportunities to be had from this newfound sales growth.
First up, Ford (NYSE:F[1]) reported a 13% jump in August sales compared with a year ago; this topped analyst expectations of a 9.8% rise. In July, Ford had posted a 3.8% drop in U.S. sales. Last month’s growth was driven by a 28% surge in sport utility vehicle sales, particularly its Ford Escape and Ford Explorer models.
At the same time, Ford reported growing demand for its more fuel-efficient models in response to rising gasoline prices. As you can see on its Portfolio Grader stock report page, F is currently a D-rated sell[2], but I will keep tabs on analyst activity in the next few weeks to see if the analyst community upwardly revises its estimates for Ford’s quarterly sales and earnings. The Street view currently calls for just 0.4% sales growth and a 14.7% drop in earnings.
So I don’t recommend that you jump on the Ford bandwagon just yet—buying pressure for this stock is still quite low, making this stock more trouble than it is worth at the moment.
Ford’s largest competitor General Motors (NYSE:GM[3]) announced that its U.S. auto sales advanced 10% over August 2011, making last month the company’s best month in terms of retail. General Motors’ Chevrolet brand did particularly well, with the Equinox, Sonic and Volt fueling a 25% jump in sales.
But like Ford, General Motors is also a D-rated sell[4] due to lackluster buying pressure. And analysts are even more downbeat about General Motors’ top — and bottom — line this quarter—forecasts call for a 2.5% drop in sales and a whopping 41.7% drop in earnings!
Finally, Chrysler also announced a 14% year-over-year jump in August sales thanks to robust demand for the Fiat brand. This is the 29th consecutive month that the company has posted year-over-year sales growth.
On top of this, the company revealed that August sales of the 2013 Dodge Dart surged 300% compared with July. Chrysler is the one Big Three company that is not listed in my Portfolio Grader tool, and that’s because it is owned in part by Italian manufacturer Fiat.
There’s no doubt that August was a good month for U.S. automakers: Overall, new car sales in the U.S. are forecast to advance 20% compared with August 2011 and 12% compared with the prior month.
But I recommend that you give these companies a bit more time before making any new buys. If you’re really itching to get into the automobile industry, there is strength to be had among the recreational vehicle segment.
In particular, my Portfolio Grader tool has isolated three recreational vehicle companies that are going strong in terms of buying pressure and fundamentals.

Several Pensacola bands are getting their chance to shine at DeLuna again this year. Let’s support them, loud and proud.
Paloma
1:30-2 p.m., Saturday, WindCreek Stage
Paloma has played DeLuna Fest for a few years now, usually at some official after-party or on a small stage when most of the festival is coming to an end and the locals are still raging. This year, they’re on the second biggest stage, right in the middle of the day, ready to please the large crowds that might not know they’re awesome, like the Pensacolaians already do.
Pioneers! O Pioneers!
3-3:45 p.m., Friday, WindCreek Stage
Pioneers! O Pioneers! is a relatively new band, new to playing big festivals on big stages. However, they are not new to playing their hearts out and sweating their faces off. A good time will be had by all at this show. In case anyone is looking for a pre-show glimpse of their sound—who hasn’t had the pleasure of hearing it within the walls of the Handlebar—pop into Revolver Records and pick up their newest CD.
Assortment of Pensacola D.J.’s
D.J.’s like Girl Talk, Skrillex, and Deadmau5 have made mash-ups, dubstep and house music crazy popular lately, and DeLuna fest is jumping on the bandwagon. Twelve different local D.J.’s will be featured throughout the weekend on the Red Bull MTX Stage, to keep festivalgoers happy and dancing in between bands. There are even some late night shows in case people are still up for a party.

STIFLING THE REGULATORS Al Armendariz, a top Environmental Protection Agency official for his Region 6, which includes New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, has resigned over a YouTube video of a speech in which he declared that the agency should hit polluters with its full powers.
Shouldn’t that be the expectation of an EPA regulator? Well, yes, but there is a problem. Armendariz hypothesized in the speech that crucifixion might be the effective deterrent.
Nailing BP’s Tony Hayward to a cross might be a little extreme for even the most radical tree-hugger, but you have to admit it might make BP think twice about taking any more risks while drilling…might.
The YouTube video is of Armendariz speaking in 2010 to local businesses and government leaders. He focused on enforcement regulations on fracking—hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas extraction—which has become the new hot issue for the oil and gas industry.
“It is kind of like how the Romans used to conquer villages in the Mediterranean — they’d go into a little Turkish town somewhere and they’d find the first five guys they saw and they’d crucify them,” Armendariz said. “Then that little town was really easy to manage for the next few years.”
To further explain his point, Armendariz said, .”
Damn right, it would have a deterrent effect. However, Big Oil isn’t going to sit still, not when there are billions to be made.
For Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the video was what he needed to add more fuel to his campaign against EPA regulation. He used it as a club to hamper efforts by the Obama Administration to regulate fracking, and, of course, the resignation was not enough for Inhofe.
“After his revelation that E.P.A.’s ‘general philosophy’ is to ‘crucify’ oil and gas companies, it was only right for Administrator Armendariz,” Sen. Inhofe said in a statement, “but his resignation in no way solves the problem of President Obama and his E.P.A.’s crucifixion philosophy.”
The one who got “crucified” was Armendariz. Time will tell how effective the deterrent is to others trying to regulate fracking.

The fall TV season is just around the corner, bringing us aliens, visions of the future and slutty witches. Here's a complete rundown of new and returning shows, with launchdates and clips, so you won't miss any of the shininess.
Mondays:
Heroes
The conflicted heroes and struggling villains move on with their lives this season. Clarie goes to college, Parkman gets another chance at love, Sylar gets into politics — sort of — and maybe, just maybe we give it one more chance to be a good show again.
It's Back: Sept. 21 on NBC at 8 PM.

Tuesdays:
V
Aliens have landed on Earth, but it's okay: They're gorgeous and welcoming, and they only want to help us. This will only lead to tears. The reimagined V series starts all over, with a new crop of visitors, lead by the gorgeous Morena Baccarin. How will the world deal with their new guests, and are the alien visitors friendly? (Are they ever?)
Premiere Date: Nov. 3rd on ABC at 8 PM.
V Promo:
Wednesdays:
MythBusters
Your favorite fact-finders are back... and getting a little wet? I'm hoping this clip from the new season shows them testing out the "who would win in a fight, human or dolphin?" myth.
It's Back: Oct. 7th on Discovery at 9 PM
Destination Truth
Josh Gates takes us across the globe again looking to explain the world's mysteries, like living dinos and merpeople. But really the best part of this program really is watching Josh work with the indigenous population of whatever country he finds himself in, who almost always get the better of our guide, I mean wouldn't you mess with the guy on a hunt for a living dinosaur?
It's Back: Sept. 9 on Syfy at 10 PM.
Clip:
Eastwick
The ladies of the tiny town of Eastwick are sex-starved and mousey — so they need to harness their inner sexiness, so they can use their sexitude to sex up their lives, with Satan. Sex sells, people! Based loosely on the John Updike novel, this new series shows what happens when a charming devil shows up in town, to unleash the witchcraft in three lucky ladies. Lindsay Price, Jaime Ray Newman and Rebecca Romijn play the witches, and Paul Gross will play Darryl, the devil with the magical penis.
Premiere Date: Sept. 23 on ABC at 10 PM

FlashForward
Possibly the most highly anticipated new series of the fall, FlashForward picks up after everyone in the world blacks out for two minutes and 17 seconds. During the black-out everyone catches a glimpse into their future, about six months ahead. Now the rest of the world has to deal with what they saw, be it the fact that they are married to another person, in the middle of an addiction relapse... or just ominous nothingness.

Vampire Diaries
Vampires in High School? Why, that's crazy talk. Who would watch a show about 28-year-old actors playing vampires who enroll back into High School to win the attention of a young girl? Me, that's who — bring on the brooding and bite marks. Vampire Diaries looks like it was made out of hair product and nacho cheese, it's so dramatically over-the-top. Based on the novel series of the same name, CW's latest supernatural teen drama is really reaching for that Twi-market, let's hope it doesn't disappoint. Roll on another layer of that lip gloss boys — mama needs a new vamp fetish.
Premiere Date: on CW @ 8 PM Begins Sept. 10

Supernatural
Finally, the spring's most agonizing cliffhanger is resolved — the Winchester boys are back, and they've unleashed Lucifer, played by none other than Mark Pellegrino — that's Jacob from Lost. But the brothers have a huge handicap in fighting Hell on Earth, since they're still pretty pissed at each other. This could very well be the final season of Supernatural, which means this could be the season where the big Dean-versus-Sam apocalyptic throw down takes place.
It's Back: Sept. 10 on the CW at 9 PM.

Fringe
Alternate worlds collided last season. Olivia finally met THE William Bell, played by none other than Geek God Leonard Nimoy (who should be back in at least a couple of episodes). Walter led us to a suspicious head-stone which made us all scratch our heads and say "wait a minute how can that be Peter Bishop, if he's Peter Bishop? Ohhhh." From the looks of the preview, Olivia thinks she has to save the world, but knowing her usual "shoot first, ask questions later" tactics, she's going to need a lot more bullets. But let's hope this season first answers some questions, like what's different in the alternate world, besides the fact that the World Trade Center is still standing and Agent Charlie Francis' sexy face scar — and Charlie, of course, is about to be replaced anyways by another sexy woman FBI Agent.

Zod is front and center this season, and will hopefully bring more of a battle than that lackluster Doomsday finale. Plus the Kryptonite-hearted villain Metallo shows up (played by Brian Austin Green). Will Chloe be able to heal her wounded heart in time to meddle in everyones lives again, thus almost destroying the world over and over? My guess is yes.

It's Back: Oct. 11th on Discovery at 10 PM

Brock is gone, and Hank and Dean are actually going to mature and grow up? Say it isn't so! But at least the latest promo for the new season for Venture looks like classic Venture insanity-humor.

Results of an autodial poll released July 13 show Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann with a wide lead over her competitors I the Iowa precinct caucuses.
The poll, conducted for Magellan Data and Mapping Strategies, showed Bachmann winning the support of 29 percent of likely 2012 Iowa Republican caucus-goers.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is in second place with 16 percent support followed by Tim Pawlenty and Herman Cain at 8 percent, Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich at 5 percent and Rick Santorum at 3 percent. Nearly a quarter, 24 percent, was undecided.
Bachmann had broad support across all voting subgroups including fiscal and social conservatives. The Waterloo native won the support of 33 percent of the 44 percent of respondents who self-identified as member of the Tea Party movement.

I suppose now Arabs will complain about how Israel’s missile shield lowers their self esteem .. seeing as how their greatest achievement is indiscriminately firing missiles that they don’t know how to make in the general direction of Israeli cities
Or maybe they’ll parade some child who they say was wounded by the falling debris from one of these explosions and claim Israel is guilty of “disproportionate self defense”

The street justice story reminds me of a great story from the local bike couriers from a few years back. One of the couriers had his bike stolen and managed to catch the guy. He performed a citizen’s arrest and used a U-lock to secure the individual to a parking meter while waiting for the police…he also radio’d all of the other city couriers his location. Apparently the rule was that no one was to physically touch the perp, but hey, sometimes the need to relieve yourself comes suddenly…and the police made sure they took their good sweet time attending. Sometimes a good old fashioned shaming goes a long ways.

Fur, I don’t know the inside story about what is driving this format change, but the compliment to your parody, satire, ridicule, enlightenment, and entertainment content is the reader comments. They create a community and a draw for more viewers and participants.
This new sticky post format that just links to stories, makes you another aggregator and changes the characteristic of this site that makes it so appealing.
If I’m uninformed and way off base, I apologize – this is just my initial reaction. My thought is that I would rather see one comment allowed post in the space where you’re posting multiple links.

To what extent can a defendant in intellectual property infringement proceedings resist an IP owner's action on the ground that the IP owner is transgressing competition rules, either by abusing his monopoly (EC Treaty, Art.82) or by ganging up with others in order to pervert or distort competition (EC Treaty, Art.81)?
Right: IP owners are entitled to ward off infringers, but can they do so if they also keep out lawful competition?
IPKat co-bloggie Jeremy is currently putting the finishing touches to a talk he's giving in a fortnight's time on this topic and it occurred to him that, though there are lots of British cases in which so-called "Euro-defences" are raised, he has never thought of looking for any cases in which these defences have been discussed or allowed in other national jurisdictions in the European Union. Nor does he recall any instance in which the principle of the availability of competition law defences to IP infringement actions has been reviewed by the European Court of Justice - even though the impact on trade is potentially far-reaching if some countries allow Euro-defences while others say, "sorry we can't help you if you're infringing an IP right - if you've got a grievance against an IP owner you have to go through the relevant competition policy enforcement procedures".
If anyone has any observations on this topic, an email to Jeremy here will be greatly appreciated. All useful contributions will be duly acknowledged in the conference paper.

Over 136 m/- have been spent by the Tanzania Olympics Committee (TOC) in preparation expenses of the Olympic-bound athletes ahead of boarding the London Heathrow flight on July 8.
TOC secretary general Filbert Bayi said the colossal amount has been used for accommodation, allowances and logistics for the athletes and their coaches since opening the camp in March.
The Olympic hopefuls that include runners and boxers have been camping at the Filbert Bayi Secondary Schools in Kibaha, an institution owned by Bayi himself.
According to him, judo attended TOC organised camp in Zanzibar to prepare for the Olympic qualification series staged in Morocco
He said TOC started the athletes camp early ahead of the Olympic Games qualifying series, and the camp was still open after some athletes attained the qualifying time.
He also faulted some sections of people who are accusing TOC for not preparing the London-bound athletes well. He said it is not the mandate of his committee to prepare athletes; instead it’s the duty of sports disciplines.
Bayi said TOC is the overseer of all 22 sports associations in the country and its main objective is to put strategic plans.
Organizing training courses for sports coaches, administrators and providing marketing expertise to leaders of sports associations are among other things the TOC is responsible for.
He said since coming into TOC leadership, more than 500 coaches who works with their respectable associations are beneficiaries of coaching programmes.
However, he said the TOC trained coaches can not function if the Government is not showing serious interest to develop sports in the country.
“It’s the duty of sports disciplines to prepare their teams for qualification of the Games and TOC just come in charge of the selected athletes,” said Bayi.
Deplored comments made by some people who calls for pulling out of the Games based on inadequate preparations, he said the spirit is unsportsmanship as not all Olympians win medals.
He said those who are advocating for the withdraw should know that athletes who attained qualifying games had to sweat to win the berth.
According to Bayi, withdrawing from the Games will hinder sports growth of the athletes as some of them are very young and are travelling to London not only to compete for medals but also to learn.
“Sometimes we must put aside our emotions and look at the brighter side of everything. It’s unsportsmanship to pull out the Olympic team from the Games.
The athletes will gain some experience which can be used in the future,” he said.
He also revealed that TOC technical committee agreed to camp the London- bound team at Kibaha as the weather is reminiscent to that of London during the Games, albeit the area is good for runners due to low population density.
However, Bayi said some Athletics Tanzania (AT) officials were reluctant to have a camp at Kibaha and had suggested Mbulu.
He said TOC technical committee did not object to this idea but AT officials have not followed to re-camp the team at their preferred area. Due to the delay TOC agreed the athletes’ camp should remain at Kibaha.
“Kibaha is ideal place to prepare the team as I practiced there on different occasions from 1976 to 1979 on my way to break the 1,500 metres world record in Jamaica. The place has good weather similar to that of London and other American countries,” he concluded.

More than half of us, 56%, prefer planning for tomorrow instead of living for today. In the Age of Social Media, those planning ahead may not only be thinking about finances or retirement. Rather, they may be planning for a future where they will not want a professor, a potential employer or future friends to know what they’ve been up to via a medium that is almost impossible to “clean up.” Posts have a way of catching up with you.

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team’s (HOT) response to Haiti remains one of the most remarkable examples of what’s possible when volunteers, open source software and open data intersect. When the 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck on January 12th, 2010, the Google Map of downtown Port-au-Prince was simply too incomplete to be used for humanitarian response. Within days, however, several hundred volunteers from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) commu-nity used satellite imagery to trace roads, shelters and other important features to create the most detailed map of Haiti ever made.
OpenStreetMap – Project Haiti from ItoWorld on Vimeo.
The video animation above shows just how spectacular this initiative was. More than 1.4 million edits were made to the map during the first month following the earthquake. These individual edits are highlighted as bright flashes of light in the video. This detailed map went a long way to supporting the humanitarian community’s response in Haiti. In addition, the map enabled my colleagues and I at The Fletcher School to geo-locate reports from crowdsourced text messages from Mission 4636 on the Ushahidi Haiti Map.
HOT’s response was truly remarkable. They created wiki’s to facilitate mass collaboration such as this page on “What needs to be mapped?” They also used this “OSM Matrix” to depict which areas required more mapping:
The purpose of OSM’s new micro-tasking platform is to streamline mass and rapid collaboration on future satellite image tracing projects. I recently reached out to HOT’s Kate Chapman and Nicolas Chavent to get an overview of their new platform. After logging in using my OSM username and password, I can click through a list of various on-going projects. The one below relates to a very neat HOT project in Indonesia. As you can tell, the region that needs to be mapped on the right-hand side of the screen is divided into a grid.
After I click on “Take a task randomly”, the screen below appears, pointing me to one specific cell in the grid above. I then have the option of opening and editing this cell within JOSM, the standard interface for editing OpenStreetMap. I would then trace all roads and buildings in my square and submit the edit. (I was excited to also see a link to WalkingPapers which allows you to print out and annotate that cell using pen & paper and then digitize the result for import back into OSM).
There’s no doubt that this new Tasking Server will go a long way to coordinate and streamline future live tracing efforts such as for Somalia. For now, the team is mapping Somalia’s road network using their wiki approach. In the future, I hope that the platform will also enable basic feature tagging and back-end triangulation for quality assurance purposes—much like Tomnod. In the meantime, however, it’s important to note that OSM is far more than just a global open source map. OSM’s open data advocacy is imperative for disaster preparedness and response: open data saves lives.

PRODUCERS’ NOTE
Like all of the musicians on this album, we grew up deeply affected by the music of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Perhaps it was even deeper for us as Europeans, because America was only a place we dreamed of, a far-off romantic world that we tried to understand, and music, movies and books were the among the ways we discovered it. This album is our little effort to thank the four men who opened up that world to us, and made it sing in harmony for more than forty years.
Heartfelt thanks go also to all of the artists and bands — most of them good friends of ours — who are part of our larger musical world. Not only did you create your own great music, gifting us with beautiful original songs, but helped us make this tribute album possible.
Music is love. That has always been the case. Once upon a time, through the songs of CSNY, we discovered that love was worldwide.

A PRESENTATION BY DAVE ZIMMER, author of “Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography” and editor of “4 Way Street: The Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young Reader”
The music of David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young has moved so many people, reaching across borders around the world, their music resonating with loyal legions of fans and inspiring musicians everywhere. In the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, writing, singing, playing and performing at the peak of their talents, they released a series of albums together and as individual artists that established key signposts of their musical styles, distinct but connected, forged with otherworldly harmony blends, vintage rosewood acoustic guitars, as well as big white and old black electric guitars, that endure to this day. What draws us so powerfully to these artists? For me, it’s a combination of Crosby’s mind-bending chords and vocals, Stills and Young’s multi-colored guitar explorations, and Nash’s timeless messages and high harmony, cresting stunning songwriting that addresses both personal and social issues. While the artists had all previously made their marks in formidable rock and roll bands — Crosby in The Byrds, Stills and Young in Buffalo Springfield and Nash in The Hollies — the unique character of their music kept growing. More than 40 years ago, these musicians were looking inward, speaking out and writing songs that helped define a generation. Well, that generation grew up, as did the artists, but this connection and bond continued; then new generations discovered them, and much of the musicrip. There is even a family tie.
That CSNY feels like a family, with all of the love, rivalry and resiliency this entails, extends to the fans and musicians around them, creating a circle of fellowship and fraternity that is often unspoken but very real. There is a sense that “we’re all in this together” and can share in the communal experience. The specter of love looms large with each of these artists, who have turned matters of the heart inside out with so many of their songs, capturing feelings of tenderness, hope and tattered emotions, often writing about the ladies they cherished and longed for. Still, a good number of their songs can be interpreted with musicians of either gender, as this collection shows so well, with both male and female vocalists bringing out the essence of feelings expressed. There is an emotional center to the melding of words and music that allows for so many extraordinary contemporary interpretations.
It feels appropriate, right and true, then, that the umbrella song that graces this compilation is “Music Is Love,” David Crosby’s mantra that evolved into a magical track in collaboration with Graham Nash and Neil Young in the summer of 1970. So go back to where it all began and enjoy these new takes on the music of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.

Dealing with Worries and Stress
English Translation
Book by Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid.
It is the nature of this life that people will suffer from worries
and stress, because this world is the place of disease, hardship and suffering. Hence
among the things that distinguish Paradise from this world is the fact that there is no
worry or stress].
It is also the nature of this life that people have to put up with
suffering and hardship for various reasons, as is indicated in the Qur’aan
(interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have created man in toil.”
[al-Balad 90:4]. So people feel regret for what has happened in the past, anxious about
what may happen in the future, and worried about what is going on in the present.
The things that cross our minds.
People’s worries and concerns will also differ, according to
the differences in their motivations, circumstances and individual responsibilities.
One type of worry or concern is that which may be described as worthwhile
worries that are a good sign, such as a scholar’s anxiety to resolve
difficult issues concerning which the Muslims need an answer – especially when the
matter is very serious and there appears to be no solution. Another example is the concern
of the Muslim leader about the problems of the people under his care. This is what made
the two ‘Umars (i.e. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd
al-‘Azeez) and other leaders worried and anxious. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab used to
think about how to prepare the army whilst he was praying, and he was excused for that; he
also used to worry about the animals stumbling in the land of ‘Iraaq. ‘Umar ibn
‘Abd al-‘Azeez used to express his suffering thus: “I am dealing with
something with which no one could help me except Allaah. The elderly have reached the ends
of their lives with it (in this situation), the youth have grown up with it; the
foreigners have learnt Arabic and the Bedouin have migrated to the cities in these
circumstances. [It is so well-entrenched] that they think this is religion, and they can
see the truth nowhere else but in this.” When the khilaafah passed to him and
the people gave their bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to him, he came home,
feeling anxious and stressed. His freed slave said to him: “Why do I see you so
anxious and stressed? This is not how you should be on such an occasion as this.” He
said, “Woe to you! How could I not be anxious when there is no one in the East nor
the West of this ummah who is not demanding his rights of me or asking me to help
settle some matter with another person, whether he writes down his request or not, whether
he asks me directly or not?”
The more any decision had to do with the fate of the Muslims, the
greater the anxiety and stress involved. Hence when ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf was
entrusted with the task of selecting the next khaleefah for the Muslims, after the
death of ‘Umar, he did not sleep during that period, because he was so busy
consulting the Muslims, even the old women.
Other types of commendable concern include: the concern of the dai’yah
who is striving to spread Islam and convey the message, guiding others to the path of
Guidance; the concern of the worshipper to ensure that his worship is correct both in
intention and practice; and the concern of the Muslim for the suffering of his brothers in
faith throughout the world…
Kinds of anxieties that may result from committing sin include:
the distress suffered after shedding blood wrongfully; or the anxiety of a woman who is
pregnant as a result of fornication or adultery.
Kinds of distress that result from wrongful treatment at the hands of
others include that suffered because of mistreatment by one's own relatives, as
the poet said: “The wrong suffered at the hands of those who are closely-related is
more painful to bear than a blow from a powerful sword.”
Distress suffered because of the calamities that happen in this world
include: chronic or serious diseases, disobedience of children towards their parents,
hostility on the part of one’s wife or mistreatment on the part of one’s
husband.
Some kinds of anxiety result from fears about what may lie ahead in the
future, for example a father may be worried about what will happen to his children
after he dies, especially if they are weak and he has nothing to leave behind for them.
These are a few examples of different kinds of stress
and worry. We will discuss the matter in further detail below:
[ Table of Contents ]
2. Kinds of Stress and Worry:
The distress suffered by the dai’yah when he calls his
people to Islam. The Prophets had more than their fair share of this kind of
stress. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) told her nephew (the son of
her sister) ‘Urwah that she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
him): “Did you ever suffer any day worse than the day of Uhud?” He said: “I
suffered what I suffered at the hands of your people, and the worst that I suffered from
them was on the day of ‘Aqabah, when I had made an appeal to Ibn ‘Abd Yaalayl
ibn ‘Abd Kalaal and he did not respond in the way I had hoped for. I left him, hardly
knowing where I was going, and I did not realize where I was until I had reached Qarn
al-Tha’aalib. I raised my head, and saw a cloud which was shading me. I looked in it,
and saw Jibraa’eel, who called to me and said: ‘Allaah has heard what your
people have said to you, and their response to you. He has sent to you the Angel of the
Mountains, to do whatever you tell him to do to them.’ Then the Angel of the
Mountains called to me, greeted me, and said, ‘O Muhammad, if you wish, I will crush
them between two mountains.’” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be
upon him) said, “Rather, I hope that Allaah will bring forth from their descendents
people who will worship Allaah alone and not associate anything with Him.”
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) suffered
similar distress when his people disbelieved his account of his Night Journey (Israa’).
Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of
Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I found myself in the Hijr
(an area in the Haram in Makkah, near the Ka’bah), and Quryash were asking me
about my Night Journey, questions about Bayt al-Maqdis that I was not sure of. I felt more
distressed and anxious than I had ever felt, then Allaah raised it for me so that I could
see what they were asking me about and answer all their questions…”
Concern about acts of worship. The Messenger of Allaah (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was very concerned about telling people about salaat
(prayer). Abu ‘Umayr ibn Anas reported from his (paternal) uncles among the Ansaar
that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was worried about how to
gather the people together for prayers. Someone suggested that he set up a flag, so that
people would see it and tell one another, but he did not like this idea. Another
suggestion was a ram’s horn (the shofar of the Jews), but he did not like this
idea, and said, “This belongs to the Jews.” Someone else suggested a bell, but
he said, “This belongs to the Christians.” ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd ibn
‘Abd Rabbihi went away, worrying about the concern of the Messenger of Allaah (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he was shown the adhaan (call to prayer)
in a dream. The next morning he came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of
Allaah be upon him) and told him about it: “O Messenger of Allaah, whilst I was half
asleep and half awake, someone came to me and showed me the adhaan…”
The anxiety faced by the truthful person when he is disbelieved.
This happened to the great Sahaabi Zayd ibn al-Arqam (may Allaah be pleased with
him), when he heard the chief of the munaafiqeen (hypocrites) saying to his
colleagues: “When we return to Madeenah, the one who has pride and power will expel
the one who is humiliated” (meaning that the “one who has pride and power”
was himself, and the “one who is humilated” was the Messenger of Allaah (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the people with him). Zayd said: “I told my
(paternal) uncle, and he went and informed the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings
of Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
him) sent for (the chief of the munaafiqeen, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ubayy), who swore
that he had said no such thing. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be
upon him) believed him and not me. My uncle came to me and scolded me: “All you
wanted was for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and
the Muslims to hate you and disbelieve you!” I felt extreme anxiety and stress, such
as no one has ever suffered. When I was on a journey with the Messenger of Allaah (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him), I hung my head with worry. Then the Messenger of
Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came up to me, tweaked my ear, and
smiled at me. I felt happy in a way that I would not exchange immortal life in this world
for that feeling. Then Abu Bakr caught up with me and asked me what the Messenger of
Allaah had said to me. I said, ‘He did not say anything, but he tweaked my ear and
smiled at me.’ He told me, ‘ Be of good cheer!’ Then ‘Umar caught up
with me and I told him what I had told Abu Bakr. The next morning, the Messenger of Allaah
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited Soorat al-Munaafiqoon to
us.’”
According to a report narrated by Muslim, which tells the same story,
Zayd said: “I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and
told him about it. He sent for ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ubayy and asked him about it, but he
insisted and swore that he had done no such thing, saying, ‘Zayd is telling lies to
the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ I felt very
hurt because of what they said, until Allaah revealed words confirming that I had spoken
the truth (interpretation of the meaning): ‘When the hypocrites come to
you…’ [al-Munaafiqoon 63:1]”
The anxiety suffered by an innocent person when false accusations are
made. An example of this is what happened to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be
pleased with her) when the munaafiqoon accused her of sin during the campaign of
Muraysi’. She was ill, and when she heard the news of the rumours from one of the
women of her household, she became even sicker, and felt very distressed. She said:
“I said, ‘Subhaan-Allaah! Are people talking about that?’ I wept all night,
until morning, and never slept; my tears never stopped falling. Then I wept all day, and
never slept; my tears never stopped falling. My parents came to me the next morning, after
I had cried for two nights and a day, without ceasing and without sleeping. They thought
that this weeping would kill me. Whilst they were sitting with me, and I was crying, a
woman of the Ansaar asked permission to see me. I gave her permission, and she sat down,
weeping with me. Whilst we were sitting thus, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and
blessings of Allaah be upon him) came in, greeted us, and sat down. He had not come to
visit me since the rumours had started, and for a month there had been no Revelation
concerning my situation. Whilst he was sitting there, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and
blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited the Shahaadah, then he said: ‘O
‘Aa’ishah, I have heard such-and-such about you. If you are innocent, Allaah
will prove your innocence, and if you did commit a sin, then ask for Allaah’s
forgiveness and repent to Him, for when the slave admits his sin and repents to Allaah,
Allaah will accept his repentance. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of
Allaah be upon him) had finished what he had to say, my tears stopped completely, and I
said to my father: ‘Respond to what the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of
Allaah be upon him) has said.’ He said, ‘By Allaah, I do not know what I should
say to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ I said
to my mother: ‘Respond to what the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of
Allaah be upon him) has said.’ She said, ‘By Allaah, I do not know what I should
say to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ I said:
‘I am only a young girl and I do not know much of the Qur’aan. By Allaah, I have
nothing to say to you except the words of the father of Yoosuf: “… So (for
me) patience is most fitting. And it is Allaah (Alone) Whose help can be sought against
that which you assert.” [Yoosuf 12:18].’ Then I turned away and lay down on
my bed. Then Allaah revealed (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Verily! Those who
brought forth the slander (against ‘Aa’ishah) are a group among you. Consider it
not a bad thing for you…’” [al-Noor 24:11 – see complete passage,
aayat 11 to 20].
Before ‘Aa’ishah’s time, Maryam bint ‘Imraan had
suffered a great deal of stress and anxiety because she became pregnant without being
married. Her distress reached such an extent that: “…She said: ‘Would
that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight!’”
[Maryam 19:23 – interpretation of the meaning]. She spoke thus because she knew that
people would accuse her and not believe her when she came to them with a child in her
arms, because she had been one of the devoted female worshippers who lived in seclusion
close to the mosque, and she came from a very religious household and was descended from
Prophets. Because of all this, she bore such a great burden of anxiety that she wished
that she had died before this happened to her, or that she “had been forgotten and
out of sight,” in other words, that she had never been created at all.
Another example is the story of the women who was accused unjustly.
‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) told her story: “A black woman
who belonged to some of the Arabs became Muslim. She had a cubicle in the mosque. She used
to come to us and talk with us, and when she had finished conversing with us, she told us:
‘The day of the wishaah (an ornamented girdle worn by women) was one of the
wonders of our Lord. Indeed, it is He Who saved me from the land of kufr
(disbelief).’” When she repeated this several times, ‘Aa’ishah asked
her, “What was the day of the girdle?” She said: “A young girl who belonged
to some of my people went out wearing a girdle made of leather. She dropped it, and a kite
(a kind of hawk) came and swooped it up, thinking that it was a piece of meat. They
accused me of taking it, and they began to punish me, to the extent that they even
searched my private parts. Whilst they were surrounding me and I was in that state of
distress, the kite flew back over our heads and dropped the belt. They picked it up, and I
said to them: ‘This is what you accused me of, and I was innocent!’”
A man’s worry about what may happen to his wife and children after
his death. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that the
Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say: “One of
the things that concerns me is what will happen to you [his wives] after my death, for
none will be able to take care of you properly except those who are truly patient.”
Anxiety because of a loan. An example of this is what happened
to al-Zubayr (may Allaah be pleased with him), whose story was told by his son
‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr: “When al-Zubayr stood up to fight at the Battle of
the Camel, he called me, so I went and stood by his side. He said: ‘O my son, no-one
will be killed today except one who is a wrongdoer or one to whom wrong is done. I can see
that I will die today as one to whom wrong is done. My greatest concern is my debts –
do you think that any of our wealth will be left after paying off our debts? O my son,
sell our property and pay off our debts.’” ‘Abd-Allaah said: “He
started to advise me what to do about his debt, and told me: ‘O my son, if you are
unable to pay off anything, seek the help of my mawlaa.’ By Allaah, I did not
know what he meant until I asked, ‘O my father, who is your mawlaa?’ He
said: ‘Allaah.’ By Allaah, every time I felt distress because of difficulty in
paying off his debt, I prayed, ‘O Mawlaa of al-Zubayr, pay off his debt,’
and Allaah paid it off…’” ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr said: “I
calculated how much he owed, and found it to be two million and two hundred thousand…
(some of al-Zubayr’s friends did not think it possible to pay off such a great debt,
but Allaah greatly blessed some land belonging to al-Zubayr, and surprisingly enough, when
it was divided up and sold off, there was enough to pay off the debt and have something
left over)…Al-Zubayr had four wives: one-third of his wealth was put aside for them,
and each wife got one million and two hundred thousand. The total sum of his wealth was
fifty million and two hundred thousand.”
Anxiety caused by dreams. This happened to the Prophet (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as he said: “Whilst I was sleeping, the
treasures of the earth were brought to me, and two armlets of gold were placed on my arms.
That distressed me, but Allaah revealed to me that I should blow them away, so I did so,
and they disappeared. I interpreted them as being the two liars whom I am facing, the one
in Sana’aa’ and the one in al-Yamaamah.”
Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) also
felt distress because of a dream which he saw. He told us about it: “Some men among
the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
used to see dreams at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah
be upon him). They used to tell him about them, and he would say ‘Ma sha’
Allaah.’ I was a young boy, and I used to live in the mosque before I got
married. I said to myself, ‘If you were any good, you would have seen something like
these people have seen.’ When I lay down that night, I said, ‘O Allaah, if You
see any good in me, then let me see a dream.’ Then two angels came to me, each of
whom was holding an iron bridle in his hand. They dragged me to Hell, and I was praying,
‘O Allaah, I seek refuge with you from Hell.’ Then I dreamt that I was met by
another angel, who was also holding an iron bridle in his hand. He said, ‘Do not
worry, you are a good man, if only you prayed more.’ They took me to the edge of
Hell, and it was shaped like a well with horns; between every two horns was an angel
holding an iron bridle. I saw in it men suspended upside down from chains, and I
recognized some men of Quraysh. Then they led me off towards the right. I told Hafsah
about it, and Hafsah told the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
him). (According to a report narrated by Muslim: “When I woke up, I felt worried and
scared about what I had seen, so I asked Hafsah about it, and she said, ‘It is good,
what you have seen.’ I said to her, ‘Ask the Messenger of Allaah (peace and
blessings of Allaah be upon him) about it,’ so she asked him.”) The Messenger of
Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘ ‘Abd-Allaah is a
righteous man, if only he prayed at night.’” Naafi’ said: “After that,
he always prayed a great deal.”
Islam prescribes a number of ways to deal with the distress that
results from seeing nightmares and frightening dreams.
Having described a number of kinds of distress and anxiety experienced
in this world, we will now discuss ways of dealing with them.
Undoubtedly the first thing we should mention when discussing worries
and anxiety is: ‘aqeedah (belief) and eeman (faith), and the effects
they have on dealing with stress. One can see many of the kuffaar and Muslims who
are weak in faith suffering breakdowns and committing suicide in an effort to rid
themselves of depression, frustration and despair when they get into trouble or when
disaster strikes. Hospitals are full of patients who are suicidal or have suffered nervous
breakdowns, or other kinds of psychological trauma. These problems affect many of those
who are strong, let alone those who are weak. How often they lead to complete incapacity
and loss of sanity!
The person who has been guided to Islam, if his ‘aqeedah is
sound and his eemaan is strong, will find the cure in that which has come from
Allaah, the All-Knowing and All-Aware, Who created all things and Who knows best what
befits His creation. “Should not He Who has created know? And He is the Most Kind
and Courteous (to His slaves) All-Aware (of everything).” [al-Mulk 67:14 –
interpretation of the meaning].
3. Islam's Treatment for Anxiety and
Worry
Let us now discuss some of the different kinds of remedies and
treatments taught by Islam:
1. Equipping oneself with eemaan (faith), accompanied by righteous deeds.
Allaah says (interpretation of the]
The reason for this is clear: the believers in Allaah whose faith is
correct and motivates them to do righteous deeds that reform their hearts and characters,
and change their status in this world and the next, have the basic principles according to
which they deal with every kind of joy and grief that they may face. They receive
blessings and joys with acceptance and thanksgiving, and put them to use in beneficial
ways. When they do this, they feel happy and hope that it will last and will bring them
reward for their gratitude, as well as other things that will supercede the original
goodness and blessings.
When faced with distress, harm, worries and anxieties, they try to
resist them and reduce them as much as they can, and they react with befitting patience to
the things in which they have no choice. They gain a lot of benefits as a result, such as:
resilience and toughness as is appropriate; useful experience, strong willpower, patience,
the hope of reward, and many other benefits which reduce the distress felt. Thus their
anxiety is replaced with joy and the hope of blessings and reward from Allaah, as the
Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated in the saheeh hadeeth:
.”
This is the way in which we may view calamities in a positive light.
Another example is:
2. Thinking of how the Muslim may earn expiation for his sins, purify
his heart and raise his status, when he is stricken with distress and worry in this life.
The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
said: “Nothing of fatigue, illness, distress, worry, grief or harm befalls the
Muslim, not even a prick from a thorn, but Allaah will accept it as expiation for some of is not wasted, but serves a purpose in increasing his hasanaat
(good deeds) and expiating for him expiate for
his sins, he will rejoice and be of good cheer, especially if that happens to him straight
after he has committed a sin, as happened to some of the Sahaabah, may Allaah be pleased
with them. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mughaffal (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that a
man met a woman who had been a prostitute during the time of Jaahiliyyah. He
started to joke with her, then he touched her. She told him, “Watch it! Allaah has
destroyed shirk (once ‘Affaan said: has destroyed Jaahiliyyah) and has
brought us Islam.” The man went away, and walked into a wall, cutting his face. The
Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came along, so the man told him what
had happened, and he said: “You are a slave for whom Allah his punishment in
this world, and if He does not wish good for him, He withholds the punishment until he is
dealt with for his sin on the Day of Resurrection.”
3. Understanding the reality of this world
The believer knows that this world is only temporary, that its luxuries
are few, and that whatever pleasures exist here are always imperfect. If it causes a
little laughter, it gives many reasons to weep; if it gives a little, it withholds far
more. The believer is only detained here, as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings
of Allaah be upon him) said: “This world is the prison of the believer and the
paradise of the kaafir.”
This world is also fatigue, pain, misery and suffering, so the believer
feels relief when he departs from it. Abu Qutaadah ibn Rib’i al-Ansaari used to say
that a funeral passed the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
and he said: “He is now relieved, and people feel relieved of him.” The people
asked, “O Messenger of Allaah, how can he be relieved and people feel relieved of
him?” He said, “The believing slave (who dies) is relieved of the fatigue and
pain of this world and has gone to the mercy of Allaah; when the rebellious slave dies,
people, land, trees and animals are relieved of him.”
For the believer, death brings a respite from the distress, worries and
pain of this life, as is stated in the hadeeth: “When the believer is about to die,
the angels of mercy bring white silk and say, ‘Come out content, with the pleasure of
Allaah upon you, to the mercy of Allaah and sweet fragrance and a Lord who is not
angry.’ So (the soul) comes out like the best fragrance of musk and the angels hand
it to one another until they bring it to the gate of heaven. They say, foul is
this stench,’ until they bring it to the souls of the kuffaar.”
This understanding of the reality of this world makes it easier for the
believer to bear afflictions, pains, distress and anxiety, because he knows that they are
an inevitable part of the nature of this life.
4. Following the examples of the Prophets and the righteous
The Prophets and the righteous suffered more distress in this world
than other people. Each person is tested according to the strength of his faith. If Allaah
loves a person, He tests him. Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allaah, which of the
people suffers the most distress?” He said: “The Prophets, then those who come
after them (in terms of status), then those who come after them. A man will be tested
according to the strength of his faith. If his faith is strong, then the distress with
which he is tried will be greater; if his faith is weak, he will be tested in accordance
with the level of his faith. Distress will keep on befalling the slave until he walks on
the face of the earth free from sin.”
5. Making the Hereafter one’s main concern
The concerns of this world overwhelm and confuse people, but if the
slave makes the Hereafter his main concern, Allaah will help him to focus and be
determined, as was narrated by Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him): “The Messenger
of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever has the
Hereafter as his main concern, Allaah will fill his heart with a feeling of richness and
independence; he will be focused and feel content, and this world will come to him in
spite of it. Whoever has this world as his main concern, Allaah will cause him to feel
constant fear of poverty; he will be distracted and unfocused, and he will have nothing of
this world except what was already predestined for him.’”].”
6. A surprisingly effective remedy: remembering death
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”
7. Praying to Allaah, may He be exalted
Du’aa’ (prayer or supplication) is very beneficial, and
includes both protection and treatment. As far as protection in concerned, the Muslim is
obliged to turn to Allaah and pray to Him for refuge from distress and to keep him away
from it, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do. His
servant Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) tells us: “I used to serve the
Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he stayed in
Madeenah (i.e. was not travelling). I often used to hear him saying: ‘Allaahaah, I
seek refuge with You from distress, grief, incapacity, laziness, miserliness, cowardice,
the burden of debt and from being overpowered by men).’”: ).”
When distress and pain befall a person, the door of du’aa’
is always open to him; it is never closed. When one calls upon the Most Generous, He will
respond and give. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ]
One of the greatest du’aa’s which take away distress
and anxiety and bring joy is the famous du’aa’ which the Prophet (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged everyone who hears it to learn it by
heart: important hadeeth indicates the following: the slave should admit
that he belongs to Allaah and that he cannot do without Him and has no other master than
Allaah; that he should be a slave to Allaah, announce his submission to Him, obey His
commandments and heed His prohibitions; that Allaah is directing and controlling him as He
wills; that he should demonstrate his submission to Allaah and his acceptance of His
decree; that he should pray to Allaah, using all His Names, then ask for what he needs.
A number of other
al-kareem (There is no god but Allaah, the All-Powerful, the Forbearing; there is no
god but Allaah, Lord of the mighty Throne; there is no god but Allaah, Lord of heaven,
Lord of earth, and Lord of the noble Throne).”
Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that when the Messenger
of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was distressed by something, he
would say: “Yaa Hayyu yaa Qayyoom bi rahmatika astagheeth (O Ever-Living, O
Eternal, by Your mercy I seek help).”
Asmaa’ bint)’”
If a person thinks about the meaning of these du’aa’s
and prays with concentration and a sincere intention, doing all those things that can help
to bring about a response, Allaah will fulfil his hopes and do the things asked for; He
will turn his distress into joy.
If the du’aa’ comes from a heart which is filled with
faith, it will dispel worry and bring comfort. The scholars have mentioned many stories of
people who prayed to Allaah in times of calamity and distress, and Allaah responded to
their prayer and saved them from an enemy, or from drowning, or from starvation or
disaster. One example is the story of what happened to the great Sahaabi al-‘Alaa
al-Hadrami, who was one of the most prominent scholars and devoted worshippers, one of the
close friends (awliyaa’) of Allaah whose du’aa’s are
answered. During the campaign against the apostates of Bahrain, he pitched camp, but
before the people could settle down, the camels bolted, carrying away all the provisions
of the army, including their tents and water, leaving them with nothing but the clothes
they were wearing. It was night-time, and they could not restrain even one camel. The
people were filled with indescribable distress and alarm, and some of them began making
wills to one another (because they felt that death was inevitable). Al-‘Alaa’
called the people together and said: “O people, are you not Muslims? Are you not
striving for the sake of Allaah? Are you not the ansaar (supporters) of
Allaah?” They said, “Of course.” He said, “Then be of good cheer, for
Allaah will not forsake anyone who is in your situation.” When the time for Fajr
prayer came, he called the people to pray and led them in prayer, then he knelt up, and
the people did likewise. He started to pray (make du’aa’), raising his hands,
and the people did likewise. They prayed until the sun rose, and the people began to look
at the mirages caused by the sun, shimmering one after another, all the while fervently
praying. When he reached the third [??], Allaah created a great stream of fresh water
beside them. [‘Alaa’] walked towards it, and the people followed him, then they
drank and washed themselves. Before the sun had reached its zenith, the camels started to
come back from all directions, bringing the supplies loaded on them, so the people did not
lose anything at all, and they were able to give water to the camels. This is one of the
signs of Allaah witnessed by the people during that campaign. (Al-Bidaayah your worries
will be taken care of and your sin will be forgiven.’”
9. Relying upon Allaah and entrusting matters to Him
“When a person knows that Allaah is Able to do all things, that He
alone makes choices for His slaves and runs their affairs, that the way He runs His
slave’s affairs is better than the way the slave would do it for himself, that He
knows better about the slave’s interests than the slave does, that He is more able to
achieve them, that He is more sincere and more merciful towards His slave than the slave
is to himself; and also knows that he cannot progress or regress any further than the
limits that Allaah has decreed for him, for nobody can change the will and decree of
Allaah – when a person knows all this, he will submit himself to his Lord and hand
over his affairs to Him, throwing himself before his Lord like a weak slave throwing
himself before a mighty and powerful king. Allaah deals with His slave as He wishes, and
the slave has nothing to do with it. Only after he has submitted thus will the slave feel
relief from his distress, worries and regrets. He gives the burden of his needs and
interests to One Who is not concerned about how heavy or great the burden is. Allaah will
take care of it, instead of him, and will show him His kindness and mercy, without the
slave getting tired or worried, because all his concern is now focused on Allaah alone.
His worry about his needs and interests in this world has been lifted from him and his
heart is now free of this concern. How good his life is now, how blessed his heart and how
great his happiness and joy!
But as for the person who insists on running his own affairs and making
his own choices, whose concern is only for his own share and not for his duties towards
his Lord, Allaah will leave him alone with the choices he has made, so he will be
surrounded by concerns, worries, distress, grief, fear, exhaustion and depression. His
thoughts will be confused, none of his deeds will be pure and none of his hopes will be
fulfilled. He will gain no respite, and will enjoy no pleasure. He will never feel joy or
contentment. He will be labouring like a working-animal, with no hope of gaining anything
that could help him in the Hereafter.”
“When a person relies upon Allaah and puts his trust in Him, he is
not controlled by bad illusions. He trusts in Allaah and hopes for bounty from Him, which
protects him from distress and worry, as well as many psychological and physical diseases.
Thus his heart gains indescribable strength, relaxation and joy. The one who is truly free
from problems is the one whom Allaah has freed and helped to strive against his own-self (jihaad
al-nafs) by seeking beneficial means of strengthening his heart and dispelling
anxiety. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… And whosoever puts
his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him…” [al-Talaaq 65:3] –
i.e., He will take care of everything that is of concern to him, whether it has to do with
his religion or his worldly affairs.
The person who relies on Allaah is strong in heart and is not adversely
affected by illusions or things that happen, because he knows that this is a sign of
weakness and fear that is unfounded. He also knows that Allaah has guaranteed to take
complete care of the one who puts his trust in Him, so he trusts Allaah and has confidence
in His promise. Thus his worries and anxiety disappear, hardship is replaced with ease,
sadness turns to joy and fear turns to a feeling of security. We ask Allaah to keep us
safe and to bless us with strength of heart and steadfastness through complete reliance on
Him, for He has guaranteed all goodness and protection from all evil and harm to those who
put their trust in Him.”
10. Other ways of dispelling distress and anxiety include paying
attention to what is beneficial, focusing on what matters today and no longer worrying
about what may happen tomorrow or regretting what happened yesterday
Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sought
refuge with Allaah from worry and regret: regret for things that have happened in the past
which one cannot go back and change, and worries about what may happen in the future. The
slave should think only about the present, focusing his energy on doing his best today,
because this is what results in perfect work, and helps him to forget his worries and
regrets. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed a du’aa’,
or taught it to his ummah, he encouraged them not only to seek the help of Allaah and hope
for His blessings, but also to work hard and strive to achieve the protection they prayed
for, for du’aa’ goes hand-in-hand with effort. Thus the slave will strive
for whatever benefits him in his religion or his worldly affairs, and will ask his Lord to
grant him the result for which he is aiming. He asks Allaah for help, just as Abu Hurayrah
reported: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
‘The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allaah than the weak believer, and
both are good. Pay attention to that which could benefit you, seek the help of Allaah and
do not feel incapacitated. If anything befalls you, do not say, “If only I had done
such-and-such, such a thing would have happened.” Say instead, “It is the decree
of Allaah, and what He wills, He does,” for saying “if only…” opens
the way for Shaytaan.’”
Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
established a link between, on the one hand, his command to strive for beneficial things
in every situation, seeking the help of Allaah, and not giving in to feelings of
inadequacy which the harmful kind of laziness, and, on the other, giving in to regret for
things in the past which are over and done with, and thinking about the will and decree of
Allaah. He described things as being of two types: things which the slave can strive to
achieve either in totality or as much as he can, or can protect himself from them, or
lessen their impact, by making an effort and seeking the help of Allaah; and others about
which he cannot do anything, so he should accept them and be content. Undoubtedly, paying
attention to this principle will bring about happiness and dispel worry and distress.
The hadeeth quoted above indicates that one should strive to
eliminate the causes of distress and bring about causes of happiness, by forgetting
about bad things in the past that cannot be changed, and by realizing that to spend too
much time thinking about such an impossible task is a foolish and crazy waste of time. So
one should try not to think about it, and try not to feel anxious about the future or
imagine fear and poverty that may or may not lie ahead. We should realize that the future,
whether good or bad, is something unknown; it is in the hands of the Almighty, All-Wise,
not in the hands of His slaves, and all they have to do is to strive for the good things
and protect themselves from bad things. The slave should know that if he distracts his
mind from worries about the future and puts his trust in his Lord, then Allaah will take
care of it and his worry and anxiety will disappear.
11. One of the most effective ways of finding comfort and contentment
is to remember Allaah frequently!”
12. Seeking refuge in prayer
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And seek help in
patience and al-salaat (the prayer)…” [al-Baqarah 2:45].
Hudhayfah said: “Whenever the Prophet (peace and blessings of
Allaah be upon him) was grieved by something, he used to pray.” When Ibn ‘Abbaas
(may Allaah be pleased with him) heard about the death of his brother, he stopped at the
side of the road – as he was on a journey – and prayed, following the command of
Allaah.
13. Another thing that may dispel worry is jihaad for the sake of
Allaah.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“You must strive in jihaad for the sake of Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, for
it is one of the gates to Paradise, and Allaah dispels worry and distress through
it.”
14. Speaking about the blessings of Allaah, both those which are
obvious and those which are hidden
Acknowledging them and speaking about them dispels worry and distress.
The slave is encouraged to have the attitude of thankfulness, which is the highest level
he can reach, even if he is in a state of poverty, sickness or other kinds of misery. If
he were to compare the innumerable blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon him with the
bad thing that has befallen him, he will see that the distress is as nothing in comparison
to the blessings. When Allaah tests His slave by means of these disasters and miseries,
and the slave does his duty of being patient and accepting, then the difficulties become
easy for him to bear, and he has the hope of earning reward from Allaah for submitting to
Him, and being patient and content. This makes bitter things sweet; the sweetness of the
reward helps him to forget the bitterness of patience.
One of the most beneficial things in this regard is to follow the
advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) given in the saheeh
hadeeth reported by Abu Hurayrah: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of
Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Look at those who are below you, not at those who are
above you, so that you will not think little of the blessings that Allaah has bestowed
upon you.”
If a person keeps this important concept (of looking only at those
below him) in mind, he will definitely feel that he is better-off than many others when it
comes to good health, physical strength, and provision (rizq) such as food,
clothing, shelter, etc., no matter what his situation. So his anxiety and distress will
disappear, and he will feel increased happiness and joy in the blessings of Allaah which
have raised him above others.
The more he thinks about the blessings of Allaah, both obvious and hidden, spiritual and worldly, he will see that his Lord has
given him many good things, and has lifted from him many bad things. No doubt
this too will dispel worries and anxieties, and bring joy and happiness.
15. Keeping oneself busy with useful work or the pursuit of
beneficial knowledge
This will distract a person’s mind from the matter that has
been causing anxiety. Maybe then he will forget the causes of his distress, and
begin to feel happier and more energetic. This is something which both believers
and non-believers may try to do, but the believer is distinguished by the fact
of his eemaan (faith), his sincerity and his hope for reward when he
occupies himself with learning or teaching something useful or doing something
beneficial. If he is keeping himself busy with worship, then this is worship,
and if he is keeping himself busy with some worldly work or custom, then he
tries to accompany it with the right intention, and seeks the help of Allaah to
do this thing as an act of obedience or worship to Him. Thus his action will be
effective in dispelling his anxiety, stress and grief. How many people are
suffering from anxiety and constant feelings of depression, which result in
various kinds of disease and illness. The right treatment for them was: to
forget the thing that caused the depression and worry, and to keep themselves
busy with some important work. It was important that the work with which they
kept themselves busy was something that they liked to do and looked forward to;
this was more effective in bringing about the desired good results. And Allaah
knows best.
16. Looking for the positive aspects of the events in which
he tends to see only things that he dislikes
Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said::
‘Why do you not ask Allaah to help us (grant us victory)? Why do you not pray to
Allaah for us?’ He said, ‘A:
5. Du'aa' (supplication):
We ask Allaah, may He be exalted, to keep us safe from distress, to grant us
relief from depression and to alleviate our worries, for He is the All-Hearing
Who answers prayers, He is the Ever-Living, Eternal.

Brewer to seek second term as Stonington selectman
No candidates for SSD seats
by
Faith DeAmbrose
As the Stonington town meeting draws near, voters will not have to work too hard deciding on candidates to fill municipal positions. There will be only one candidate on the ballot: Donna Brewer.
Incumbent Donna Brewer, who will seek a three-year term as selectman, said she is running because “I enjoy doing it.”
Brewer said some of the biggest accomplishments from her first term are a result of work done by the current board of selectmen and many previous boards of selectmen: construction of the Moose Island Causeway and the in-town sidewalk project.
“Eventually, we want to do all of [the sidewalks] but it is expensive,” said Brewer, adding that “it would be great if people would just use them.”
Brewer said she is committed to keeping the municipal budget under control, and knows the board will need to address the problem of parking. Also of concern are possible budget cuts that could affect town finances. “Hopefully we can keep things under control and make things affordable for everyone,” she said.
Also on the ballot, although with no one in the running, are two three-year “in district” seats on the Stonington Sanitary District and one three-year “at large” seat. The seats can be filled with write-in candidates.

It's got nothing to do with the ID card itself, or identification to the government with it.
Basically the vulnerability is in the update function of the AusweisApp software. It starts with hijacking the DNS query for the update server, and redirect the app to a (malicious) server, which pretends to be the real deal. Then when the fake update server presents the software with a valid SSL certificate, AusweissApp accepts this without checking whether the certificate has been issued in the correct name (I hope I translate this well - anyway the SSL certificate is not checked properly, the core of the vulnerability), and will happily download a
.zip file which is supposed to be the update for itself. Updates are distributed as .zip files.
So this is vulnerability part 1: you can have it download the wrong file.
But now it's part 2: the software will unpack the zip file before asking authorisation, and using relative path names for files in the zip archive malicious software can be placed on the user's hard disk. This of course is also an issue, it should unpack the zip in one location and disregard path names if any.
So there you have it: a glaring vulnerability that allows for remote installation of software.
The article notes they contacted the issuer of the software, who at first answered "we will look into this issue and if there really is a vulnerability issue an update", later they pulled the current version of the app from their download site without giving further explanation on why it's not available anymore.

Aging from Chiroone
Old
age doesn’t have to mean sick age or weak age. It is possible to live a long, full
life without being physically or mentally incapacitated. It is possible and ideal to
stay physically and mentally healthy your entire lifetime, reverse or
slow aging and recover physical and mental strength.
For example, in one study nine 86-96 year olds worked out with a weight machine three times a week and increased the strength of their quadriceps by an average of 174%.
Severe mental decline or senility is also not a part of normal aging – 80% of healthy Americans (barring psychological distress) suffer no significant memory loss as they age. As Cicero said, “I’ve never heard of an old man who forgot where his money was hidden.”
Chiropractic for the Elderly
Chiropractic care offers a non-medical, health centered option to the over-drugged older population who often suffer illness and death from medications. Chiropractic care frees the body from a serious form of health-damaging stress called subluxation that causes premature aging by destroying vitality and weakening our nerve system and decreasing our natural healing ability. Accepting that certain medical procedures have a place in our lives, chiropractors emphasize minimizing medical care as much as possible and saving you stress, time and money.
No one, of course, knows all the secrets of a long and healthy life, but clearly one of them is that a body free of subluxation is more flexible, balanced, stronger and healthier than a body with subluxation. Regular chiropractic spinal adjustments should be a part of every older person’s healthcare regime to help keep them younger and healthier at any age.

Got a wine- or science-related question? Email me at ithacork *at* gmail.com and I’ll do my best to answer it!
A little while ago I got an email from a reader. She writes:
I came across your blog online…I’ll be visiting the Finger Lakes soon and I was wondering if you know of any wineries that produce/sell de-alcoholized wine? I gave up drinking last year (sound decision, I promise) but still love the taste of wine. Am trying to find new and interesting de-alcoholized wines when I travel.
Here’s my response:
Thanks for reading the blog. I don’t know of any producers of de-alcoholized wines in the Finger Lakes, but I will ask around.
Do you drink a lot of de-alcoholized wine? I have had several alcohol-removed wines (in the name of science) and none of them really taste like wine to me. Alcohol actually does much for the body and especially the acid balance of wine. Alcohol-removed wine to me tastes extremely acidic.
Winemakers sensitive to those who choose not to drink alcohol can use glycerol or other agents to provide body and some even use capsaicin (from hot peppers) to replicate the “burn” of alcohol. Ariel Vineyards from California claims that its n/a wines have won gold medals against alcoholic wines. So maybe not all n/a wines are bad news.
For the Finger Lakes, though, might I suggest a compromise of spitting? I spit whenever I visit wineries, since I am usually the one driving my friends around. Spitting would give you the tasting experience and the opportunity to talk with the tasting room staff without taking in that much alcohol. Also people who spit really look like professionals, because most pros spit!
Failing that, i do know many wineries carry juice made from wine grapes.
Looking back on this advice, I’m not sure that recommending spitting was such a good idea. No matter this person’s reasons for avoiding alcohol (medical, psychological, financial, religious, or anything else), I’m not sure that the answer is bringing her into closer contact with alcoholic wine. Indeed, for those of you who do spit, alcohol CAN get into your system without you swallowing a drop. It can traverse mucous membranes contributing to some absorption into the bloodstream. Various estimates exist but some numbers that I saw estimate that 3% of the alcohol in a drink is absorbed through the mouth (questionable Ref: Wine Business Monthly). So after a full day of wine tasting, spitting only, you could still end up having the equivalent of a drink or two. Of course, that doesn’t count those wines that are so rich and delicious that you’re just compelled to gulp them down.
What do you guys think? Have you ever had a decent alcohol-removed
“wine”? Any advice for this reader?
Science!
Wine is a complex mixture of water (about 85-89%), alcohol (12-14%), organic acids like tartaric, malic, and lactic acid, sugar (sometimes), and volatile aroma compounds. If your goal is to remove alcohol from wine, you might think you could just boil it. Alcohol is more volatile than water, ergo boiling the wine will reduce the alcohol. The problem with that is that all of the aroma compounds in the wine are also volatile, so you would destroy the wine (not to mention the effect of heating the wine).
Alcohol can be removed from wines in many ways, but nowadays the most popular way is reverse osmosis. It’s a controversial topic in winemaking (see this article by PinotBlogger for some of the opposing viewpoints on alcohol removal), and I’m not really going to comment on the controversy, just the methodology.
Reverse osmosis involves high pressure, used to push the wine through a very stringent membrane filter. Only compounds whose molecular weight is smaller than 90 can pass through a tight RO filter. This includes water, ethanol, and the {volatile acidity} compounds ethyl acetate and acetic acid. Once these pass through the membrane, the alcohol and VA is removed by distillation and the water is returned to the wine. No water is added during the process. For a picture, see below.
This very simplistic diagram attempts to approximate the process of reverse osmosis on wine.

This evening I’m basking in the warm glow of a tummy filled with mashed potato! Here’s my lovely dinner (though obviously all that’s left now is the plate!) – Marinated Minty Lamb Steak with Mashed Potato and Green Veg. Yum!
Here’s how I make my Mashed Potato (no amounts because I do it all by taste/eye):
Take your potatoes (I usually use whatever general, all purpose potatoes they have in the shop – tonight it was Maris Piper), wash them and then cut/peel off any rooty or rough bits (but leave the rest of the peel still on for the tasty goodness). Chop them into smallish pieces and boil for 20 minutes. Drain, return to the pan and add a generous knob of butter.
Add a generous dusting of freshly grated nutmeg.
And a generous dollop of soured cream.
Season to taste with salt and pepper (though I tend to leave out the salt here so I can dish it up to baby DD tomorrow).
Mash away happily until it’s a consistency you like. I like to mash mine as smooth as they’ll go with a fairly open hand masher and the peely bits add texture and taste. If it’s really dry and stiff, you could add a bit of milk.
I like my mashed potatoes without lumps of potato (but not super-smooth either), and lovely and fluffy. My perfect mash hangs happily from a spoon like this:
Once it’s all mashed up, taste it and add more of anything above if you think it needs it and then add your yummy dinner. Tonight I marinated some lamb steaks before grilling them on the stove.
They were marinated in a mixture of mint sauce, my mum’s home-made plum jelly and balsamic vinegar. While making the kid’s supper earlier, I gently simmered these together for a couple of minutes to melt everything together and start to caramelise it a bit. I then covered the steaks with it and left them for a couple of hours. I threw them onto the very hot grill pan and grilled them for a couple of minutes on each side.
Add buttered green veg; tonight it’s spinach (I wilted mine rather than cook it properly by just plunging it into the boiling water from the mange tout and then draining it straight away) and lightly boiled mange tout. Make a super quick cheaty (but yummy) gravy by pouring a little bit of the vegetable cooking water into the grill pan, use a random utensil to scrape the yummy caramelised meaty marinade bits off the bottom of the pan and dissolve into the bubbling water. Add to your plate and…
Ta da!
(Though the eagle eyed people out there may notice that the pic was taken pre-gravy) …
A super easy, delicious and balanced dinner that takes all of 30 mins to prepare…
This kind of meal I can do!

This one really made me want to bang my head off of a wall. There are so many things to critique, where to begin…
I guess I’ll start with the fact that the Indians only scored one run, despite the fact that they had a base runner in every inning. They were 0-12 with runners in scoring position and left 12 men stranded on base, which is pretty pathetic if you ask me. Particularly when they’re facing Freddy Garcia; his stuff didn’t seem necessarily spectacular and he had a 7.50 ERA against the Indians dating back to 2005 (prior to today, obviously). The only Indians without a hit today were Michael Brantley, Carlos Santana and Jack Hannahan; so they obviously had no problem getting hits off Garcia. Unfortunately, the hits stayed in the park and the Indians were never able to string any together to make a big inning.
As usual with recent blowout games (which anymore, 3-0 qualifies as a blowout), Manny Acta went to Frank Herrmann and Chad Durbin after Josh Tomlin (Tony Sipp got some work as well). Herrmann had a decent outing, but Durbin was terrible yet again. Not that it mattered; the Indians weren’t going to score enough runs anyway. It’s still starting to get embarrassing to watch Durbin surrender his standard 3+ runs late in a blowout. You knew what you were getting when you signed him prior to the season, as his career ERA is 5.11. Still, his 7.39 mark this season is pretty painful. There were several teams competing for his services this spring; you have to think they’re counting their lucky stars right now that he went to the Indians.
If Josh Tomlin had better defense behind him in the fifth inning, this game may not have gotten out of hand so quickly. Shin-Soo Choo, who is already struggling at the plate, misplayed Brett Gardner’s fly ball. Austin Kearns badly misjudged Alex Rodriguez’s fly ball; it was reminiscent of the time he misjudged the fly ball during the game I attended in Anaheim in early May.
The one bright spot of the day: Orlando Cabrera reached the 2,000 hit mark in the second inning (even though the ball he hit looked more like an error by Derek Jeter, than an actual single). I’ll take what I can get at this point – congrats to O Cab.
I’m not sure where the Indians go from here. Fortunately, the Tigers lost today as well so they maintain their tie for first place. They’ve looked so bad at the plate though, I’m starting to feel they’ll never be good again (I know that’s not true, but this is extremely discouraging). Acta spoke after today’s game about how they need to “tinker” with the lineup to get more success; I’m not sure a complete detonation of the lineup will help much at this point. There need to be some changes with the actual lineup’s participants before there will be any benefits. Otherwise, it’s going to be a very, very long, depressing series with Detroit.
Durbin should be released (or traded if possible), he has not done anything all year. Even when the tribe was winning he was struggling. Not really sure what the Indians saw in him. Same goes for Kearns. He had a decent beginning to the year last year but has struggled since. The addition of Hafner will help also but won’t be much of a difference if the rest of the lineup doesn’t start producing when it counts. I think the tribe should go back to the opening day lineup, not sure it will help but it seemed to have the most success so far
I whole heartily agree trade or release Durbin. I also agree on Kearns, why is Carlos still at the three
hole? As far as durbin and kearns we have triple AAA guys that can do that good. Its wasted money let it go!
I’m sorry i meant the four hole on carlos santana.

We provide cross cultural positive psychological services for children, families and communities worldwide. Single day classes to term long courses are offered through our education programs, trainings, and curricula development that are customized to the diverse populations we serve.
Ivy Child International
Our mission is helping each child achieve their best by recognizing and enhancing their unique strengths and abilities while encouraging and enabling families to participate in the growth of their child. We strive to be a leading resource for caregivers, educators, and community organizations to receive guidance and instruction on creating a healthy child-centered environment.
Cross-Cultural Positive Psychology
Cross-cultural positive psychology investigates how cultural factors influence positive behavior. While we all experience happiness, how this emotion is expressed varies from one culture to the next. This field of psychology looks at both universal behaviors and unique behaviors to identify the ways that culture impacts familial, academic, social, professional, and other aspects of life.
The Ivy Child Approach
Through careful examination of the whole child, personal strengths and assets are identified to build an individualized Positive Psychological Plan (PPP). The Plan, which uses a holistic approach, highlights goals to be integrated into the child’s daily routine as a set of practical exercises and is designed to stimulate his/her mind, body, and spirit.

Since Spring practice began, Coach Sark has been evaluating players to find the best fit within the new schemes, and has also been making alterations to improve depth in key areas. With Luther Leonard now at receiver and working with the kickoff return team, and with Senio Kelemete now on the offensive line rather than the d-line, some of the position changes seem to be working out for the best. On Monday it was learned that Alvin Logan, who played signifcantly at wide receiver last year, has moved to safety…..a transition that will likely work out well to increase the depth in the secondary. The Tacoma News Tribune’s Blog gives a few more details of why they made the switch now. The Go Huskies Blog also does a thorough job of providing notes from practice….and they also put together a catchy Spring Football Teaser.
Along with the position changes that are evolving at practice, many are excited to see how the new offense will progress. As Bob Condotta reports in his latest practice notes installment, Coach Sarkisian is feeling good about his quarterback’s improvement throughout Spring Camp.
“It’s hard to put a gauge on exactly where you think a guy would be,” Coach Sark said of Locker. “I know this, from the midpoint of spring – practice 7, practice 8 – until now, practice 12, I know he has thrown quite a bit. He’s comfort level with the terminology, his comfort level with his progression, his comfort level when things are there to pull the ball down and run and finding that fine line there, his accuracy has gotten better. I just think his overall game has improved.”

This post is difficult for me to write and inspired by my friends Lauren and Yael, who are two of the strongest women I know.
Learning
I learned an important lesson last night. I learned my emotional limits. I truly realized for the first time, too, that my primary responsibility now is to my son and keeping us both safe for his sake. This includes eating healthy, sleeping well, and setting emotional boundaries like I’m about to do.
I’ve always rooted for the underdog, cried with the depressed, hugged the anxious. In other words, I feel I am an empathic person. Sometimes I wonder if I absorb other people’s energy because it affects me so profoundly.
Worrying
Last night, I lay awake from 1:30 until 5 in the morning worrying about a friend in trouble. Then I slept for an hour and a half before starting my morning, still deep in worry. Of course after a night like that, I had to call out of work; I was physically sick to my stomach from lack of sleep and abundance of worry. Then I cried a lot, and I turned to my friend Lauren, who has helped countless people, for advice. I struggled with what to do to help versus how far to extend myself, possibly endangering my emotional, mental, and physical health.
Struggling
And then I got mad.
I got mad at myself for having taken so much on. I realized I do that all the time, and how drained it makes me feel. Sometimes it is uplifting to know that I had a positive influence on another person’s life. Sometimes I am able to help someone through their troubles, their depression or anxiety. But right now, it’s just too much.
I got mad at my troubled friend, irrationally mad. I did not ask for the burden of the words he texted me that scared the hell out of me. I was angry with him for not seeking the proper kind of help, for not doing what needs to be done. But then I realized that when we are in the dark, it is difficult for us to see what needs to be done. My anger weakened.
Stepping Back
Times like this, when it gets to be too much for me, I need to realize that it’s OK–in fact, it is in my own best interest and that of my family’s–for me to put up what my dear friend Yael refers to as my “forcefield” and decide what I choose to let inside that forcefield.
So that’s what’s happening, starting this very minute. I’m going to find a way to help others gently–and by that, I mean that I will be gentle to myself. There’s got to be a way to help others while not carrying the load myself, right? I want to shine a light, but not if it leaves me in the dark.
Sweetie, hugs for the hard. I learned the concept of Forcefield from Havi Brooks of TheFluentSelf.com. and I traveled to Oregon twice to study with her. It’s something that you grow like a muscle. Baby steps, and some of those steps will inevitably be steps backwards, back to safety, because you are absolutely right to protect yourself. So much love to you…

Thank you so much for posting the link, Yael. I will check it out the minute I have a chance.
Well written. Perfect words. Very important. I think it’s critical to remember that if we don’t put ourselves first we can’t be of much use to others anyway, so it’s a weirdly curved circle, ya know?
Sending you loads of virtual hugs. I’m glad you put this to *paper* for yourself. For the record.

It’s a hard lesson to learn. I want to be there for everyone else. But, I’ve had to learn my limits, too. When something is too much and will take away from my family too much- I have to say no or walk away.

I did. I took a long nap–something I NEVER do. Ever. And last night, I took a long bubble bath. Ahhh… Feeling much better now.
I am sending you huge hugs. I too struggle with taking on other’s pain. I am working on listening with love & empathy. I put on my old manager hat to see if the person just needs to be heard & validated. I gently suggest resources.

Suggesting resources is a great way to handle things. Thanks for that tip.
Yay yay yay! Good for you! It’s so important. It becomes easy to take on everyone else’s burdens and try to fix everyone’s problems and yet you CAN’T. You just CAN’T do it. I know because I’ve tried. I’ve tried to be everywhere for everyone at once and you just can’t. Once you accept that it makes life so much easier. You get back to doing what you can and taking care of yourself too. So proud of you for taking care of yourself!

Thanks, Katherine. It is a struggle, but I’m learning. :)
It is so hard to step back when you know a friend is in trouble. I had to stop, once, because it was really seriously bringing me down and effecting my life. It is not easy. I’m glad you are going to be putting yourself first :)

A stunning report written by the late Eugene Mallove details the efforts of professors, researchers, and even the former President of MIT to squash cold fusion at all costs. If you have any doubt that Pons and Fleischmann had enemies desperately trying to discredit them, this article will erase it!....
A funeral party or "Wake for Cold Fusion" was held by the Plasma Fusion Center, before their replication test of Pons and Fleischmann's setup was even complete. They held another such party afterwards..
“Words to Eat”
MIT Professor Ronald George Ballinger may hold the all time record for making a foolish statement against cold fusion. He wrote in 1991: “It would not matter to me if a thousand other investigations were to subsequently perform experiments that see excess heat. These results may all be correct, but it would be an insult to these investigators to connect them with Pons and Fleischmann.”
Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the article is how Ronald R. Parker and Ronald G. Ballinger had a phone call with Nick Tate of the Boston Herald
In summary, Mallove's article paints a damning picture of MIT scientists and professors hell-bent on discrediting cold fusion. Out of desperation to protect hot fusion research, they went so far as to tell blatant lies, alter data, hurl personal insults, conduct celebrations of the "death" of cold fusion, and organize journalists to write hit pieces to try and dismiss Pons and Fleischmann's work in the public eye. Then the leadership of MIT turned away and ignored the misconduct and potentially criminal behavior, even when they were specifically alerted to it. Years later, these same individuals (working in other positions with the DOE and DOD) continued to promote the idea that cold fusion was "garbage."
If you want to know the TRUTH about why it has taken twenty plus years for a commercial cold fusion technology to be developed, you should read this article. It is a tragedy beyond measure that an institution like MIT would allow such inappropriate behavior. Everyone involved has blood on their hands from all the people on this planet that have died due to the suppression of this technology. Literally, due to their suppression of cold fusion, children have needlessly starved, millions have suffered dehydration due to a lack of clean water, the environment has been trashed, and the global economy has been almost destroyed.
If the suppression of cold fusion by MIT had never happened, we might not even have an energy crisis today! Congress.
I would really like to say that this shocks me but I've been aware of it for quite some time and sadly it is but one of hundreds of cases of scientific 'terrorism'.
And I call it terrorism because the treatment many alternative theorists have received over the years has left many of them downright terrified to even open their mouths any more, and that was and is the whole point of it.
The modern scientific establishment is a scientific dictatorship plain and simple.
Look no further than people like Albert Einstein and Hans Alfven for evidence as they are both recognized and respected for their 'mainstream' theories but both have been viciously attacked and dismissed as "insane" or "quacky" when they challenged their own theories later on or expanded on them.
When you aren't even allowed to challenge your own theories without terms like 'fringe' or 'pseudo-science' being tossed at you there is something wrong with the system.
The #1 problem with "science" today is that mathematics has become more than just a tool but has become the 'master' of science.
You have to cry when you have scientific 'celebrities' who are frequently quoted for their statement that in the pursuit of science - the understanding of physical reality - the best way to achieve results is to ignore physical reality completely and start with a mathematical construct.
Scientists are no longer even seeking to understand what physical reality is and have instead sought to create theories based on their own perceptions of physical reality, facilitated by a century + of mathematicians calling themselves scientists creating mathematical constructs with reality being an ad-hoc afterthought.
And the physical reality of things like cold fusion or astrophysical plasma electrodynamic processes can be ignored because they are either difficult to model mathematically or challenge established beliefs too much.
Or they challenge large establishments receiving billions in government and private sector funding every year.
No matter what the conclusion is the same - under the current scientific dictatorship real science is not encouraged unless it is profitable.
In cases like cold fusion it would have to be more profitable than the multi-billion dollar 'hot' fusion industry.
Though even other types of 'hot' fusion such as The Focus Fusion Society's aneutronic(no radiation) fusion using a Dense Plasma Focus(DPF) device which shows far more promise than the standard nuetronic fusion in every way but receives a tiny fraction of the funding is ignored and dismissed unprofessionally by the billion dollar neutronic fusion industry and the scientific establishment.
It's no surprise that I am equally as scientific as I am political when both sectors of the "mainstream" society today are just about as equally corrupted, by many of the same forces.
Thanks for posting this, I was well aware of the actions against cold fusion but had never heard they went so far as to have 'wake' parties over it. Not that it surprises me though.

I have terrible seasonal allergies. They are so bad, I have to receive weekly shots. Unfortunately, my kids started showing signs that they have seasonal allergies last year. My daughter gets really hoarse and almost loses her voice and my son is constantly sniffling. I was just starting to research the different children's allergy medication options when I was given the opportunity to try children's Claritin.
I have seen the commercials, so I knew that Claritin is the #1 Pediatrician-recommended non-drowsy allergy brand on the market. I was also attracted to the claims that it provides allergy relief for up to 24 hours (the less pills my kids have to take, the better). I was also pleased that it came in a grape flavor.
Review:
My daughter has been sniffling and sneezing quite a bit lately so I was looking forward to trying this product. We have used antihistamines with the kids in the past and, while it works, it makes them so tired. I gave Bella one of the chewable Claritin tablets and within the hour she was no longer sniffling! She had no reaction to the taste of the tablet (no reaction is much better than a disgusted reaction) so I must assume that the taste was tolerable. Not only did it work great, but she was bright and alert all day! My son's allergies have not been acting up lately, but I will be sure to try this product on him if/when his start up again.
Coupon Giveaway: I was given some $3 off coupons which can be used to purchase Children's Claritin (4 oz or 10 count or larger). I would love to share these with my readers. So, the first 5 readers who leave a comments telling me why they need Children's Claritin will be mailed a $3 off coupon! Please make sure to provide your email so I can get your address (US only please).
As a BzzAgent, I received a sample of Claritin as well as the coupons as part of the Children's Claritin BzzCampaign.

Kanye West is in talks with American Idol producers to become a judge on the TV talent show.
It has been reported that Kim Kardashian’s new beau is the latest name to be thrown into the mix as a possible replacement for either Steve Tyler or Jennifer Lopez, following Mariah Carey’s appointment as the newest Idol judge.
However, West is said to be ambivalent about accepting the position and if he did, he would demand a salary exceeding Mariah’s $18m pay package, or at the very least would expect that to be matched. (Give me patience).
If Kanye does join the panel, he will be taking his seat alongside Mariah and possibly fellow rapper Nicki Minaj, who is believed to be close to negotiating a deal with the show’s producers.
Randy Jackson, the only original judge on the panel, will be moving to a mentor role this season and it has been widely speculated that Idol will have four judges this season, with Alanis Morrisette, Nick Jonas, Keith Urban, Brad Paisley and Enrique Iglesias all in the running for a judging role.

THE AGE OF MIRACLES by Karen Thompson Walker
I am always amazed and very happy when a new novelist comes along and hits it out of the park. A writer shows up with a book that makes critics almost flustered with their praise. This kind of reaction is memorable, and I am gratified to know that I (sometimes) agree with them.
THE AGE OF MIRACLES by Karen Thompson Walker is a book that is beautifully written and not your typical coming of age story. Julia, age 11, is living with her parents in southern California. She is a quiet girl, more of an observer than a participant, and shy around her peers. But this is not just about Julia growing up in suburbia, it is also about the end of the world. You read that correctly, the world is supposedly coming to an end.
The earth’s rotation has slowed down, days are stretching, and gravity has been altered. Things you take for granted, like birds flying, are no longer what you expect. The lives of the world’s population is changing, but we are focused on Julia and her community, her family and school.
Julia basically has no friends and no one to confide in. She sees there is trouble with her parents, she sees her neighbors become not the people she has known all her life and she starts to see herself with possibilities. She is a preteen with a crush on a boy and all of this seems pretty normal.She is definitely a girl more mature than her years and I think that comes from being a watcher. By standing on the outside and looking in, her voice is older than her peers. But there is “the slowing” and the sun is shining for many days in a row. In all of this drama, Julia is a character that is authentic and true.
If you are reading this and thinking that the end of the world is not your cup of tea, think again. Walker is a storyteller with an original story to tell. She does a brilliant job of creating characters that you know and circumstances that are unreal and yet very real. The strength of this book is that the author has given us people we care about in a plot that is compelling and addicting.
What I am currently reading: DEFENDING JACOB by William Landay. I am almost finished and I confess I am totally sucked into this story.
Sounds like a winner. Was it aimed at the teen audience or general readers?
Thanks for the reviews! I will look for these.

Tree House Defense
In the simple and kid friendly Tree House Defense, created by Robert Zubek and Bill Robinson for Three Rings' Whirled, protect your tree house from bullies, skateboarders, skunks, and other assorted neighborhood menaces.
Place various objects like trash cans, sandboxes, and trees on the board to protect your flag. Each defense station comes with a kid, armed with weapons like paper airplanes, water balloons, and boomerangs. Each station has a point system for range, damage and delay, with different costs.
We're sorry, but this game is no longer available on the Whirled site.
Arrange these items in maze like patterns to get enough hits on your opponents before they reach your side. Each time you defeat enemies you get money to buy more objects. You continue placing objects on the board as the bullies get tougher. Your goal is to last as long as possible, and keep everyone away from your flag. You have four environments to pick from: forest, beach, winter, and Halloween, and each environment has a couple of unique assets to play with besides the standard ones on every board.
Analysis: If you find that some of the elaborate tower defense games are bit too eye glazing and forbidding to get into, then this cute and simple game is a great place to start. So, it's probably not for the seasoned tower defense veteran.
I liked the simple relatable idea of keeping the bullies at bay. The animations were cute, very Saturday morning cartoon-style. I especially liked the extras in each environment, like the Yeti and the huffing Jack-o-lantern. The gameplay feels a little slow at times, although I like that you can speed things up a bit by forcing out the next enemy on the board. I would have liked a fast forward feature. The other thing that bothered me a bit was that they used a flag as the home base instead of the tree house itself. On the plus side, there is a two player mode, and also some mention about making custom levels yourself in the future. Fight off the bullies in Tree House Defense!
FYI: the art was done by Bill Robinson, the programming by Robert Zubek, and the design was a collaboration between the two.
Thanks, MDB. I've updated the review.
Is it just me or is it taking a long time to load? Running Firefox 3.
This is a broken game without the ability to erase things. Can you really not do that? Or am I just an idiot?
But so far, it's a cool idea, executed decently. But that cool idea only lasts about 10 minutes until you realize you've already played the WHOLE game. Other games throw new stuff at you, but those 6 (or so) weapons and the 5 (or so) enemies really don't offer much.
The disability to delete objects renders the game obsolete, in my opinion.
I was kind of annoyed when I placed something wrong and had to restart. Not only that, but there isn't really a restart button (as far as I can tell), so you have to either reload the game or hasten your death in order to try again. Also, I know that upgrades can get excessively complex, but some simple ones might be nice. Something simple and linear, like the upgrades in Desktop Tower Defense, might be nice since the enemies get harder to kill in later levels. All in all a cute little game, but could use just a little bit more to be a winner. A medium/low graphics mode so it doesn't start to fritz out when I have forty snowmen?
Hi everyone,
Thanks for trying our game! It's still very much in beta, not a final version, so there are still a few balancing issues and technical bugs to fix. Thanks for the feedback! :)
If loading is taking a long time, try the latest version of Flash on IE7 (Windows) or Safari (Mac).
The game does take a long time to load. I tried using Internet Explorer to see if it worked any faster and couldnt get the game to load at all.
Yeah, I played this back when Corpse Craft was put up here and I tried out Whirled.
The biggest, most glaring issue, ever, concerning this game, is lag! MASSIVE lag! It makes the game really unenjoyable. Graphics are nice, of course, but are all those star particles necessary?
I can't seem to load this in Firefox. I turned off the NoScript for it but it's still saying I need to download Flash 9 even though I already have it.
This was working for me quite smoothly last week with Firefox 3, but today it's puttering out. Sorry guys, hopefully it will be working better later.
I was really addicted to this game with OOO rolled it out. The lack of a Destroy/Sell option drove me to tossing it out the window. I'll have to go back and play it again now that I've seen it here; see how much has changed since I was on Whirled about 3 months ago.
The lag, however, is almost becoming a trademark in all of their invention, releases, and updates. Being an avid Puzzle Pirates player, I'm still rather awed at 3 Rings for somehow taking away my ability to *only* play casual games.
This whole Whirled site just doesnt load for me - just sits on a black screen with a 'connecting to game server' box on it :(
Can it really be true that the box is identical to the trashcan except the box is more expensive *and* reloads more slowly? So that it is strictly irrational to ever use the box (unless you're trying to lose; only, there are easier ways to lose)? Or is it a way of writing in a hard mode? "Game to easy? try using the box!"
So I had nearly a perfect field, full of only trees and a few rocks, and with every single square used for maximum space. Not a single thing besides the bird made it very far, but it's impossible to stop the birds.
That's really REALLY annoying, and another reason why this game is simply not very good yet.
Has the game been removed from the website? When I click on either the link or the picture of the game on the right, a big black screen where the game is played states in the middle "That item could not be located." i'm using safari...
[Edit: Thanks for pointing this out. The game is no longer available on the Whirled site. I will update the review accordingly. -Jay]
Update

Eternal Red
There is a door. They come through that door: vile, twisted abominations, their demented forms the stuff that monsters have nightmares about. Hordes of the disfigured beasts pour through in endless waves. And that's all perfectly fine, for as hideous as these things are, they can't hurt me. They are more than welcome to share this cold, desolate place with me, free to roam beneath the ever-present pale moon. That's not the problem.
No, it's the second door, and these nightmares' unceasing attempts to get through it that I have a problem with. That just won't do.
Eternal Red is, by its own admission, a cross between a platform arena style shooter and a real-time strategic defense game. No story, no dialogue, just you and the seemingly non-stop litany of enemies appearing from one door that try to make it to the second.
To prevent this, as the game's cross-genre would imply, you must utilize a combination of personal weapons and floor traps to cut your foes down before too many of them make it to the second door. With each slain creature and each successfully survived wave you earn more money, allowing you to build traps, buy weapons, or upgrade existing equipment. You'll be doing quite a bit of all of it, too, as it doesn't take long for your traps and weapons to grow into obsolescence.
Every ten waves you will come up against a boss. These bosses are larger and slower than the typical enemy, but they come with a ton of hit points and reduce your door's counter by a significant amount if they manage to make it through.
Analysis: Eternal Red sucks you in. To give you an idea on just how engrossing of an experience this game can be, when I first sat down to play it, my intent was to do so only for five minutes to get a feel for what the game was trying to do and how well it did it. An hour later I had to force myself away from the game so I could make it to work on time, wait for my coworker to leave, and start playing all over again.
While I'm not the world's biggest fan of either strategic defense games or platform shooters, Eternal Red just seems to work so well that it quickly becomes a difficult game to put down. Instantly it grabs you with its simple yet dark and foreboding artistry: everything save the moon in the backdrop is done in black shapes outlined with red, and these wonderfully morose visuals are backed up with a macabre kind of techno soundtrack that manages to combine the oppressive mood of the setting with the intensity of the action.
And that action is quite awesome. The game starts off suitably slow, giving you time to acclimate yourself to the decently ergonomic interface and smooth controls. Soon enough, things can ramp up to a frenzied pace as you dash back and forth to make sure your floor traps are adequate to take out the ground troops while dispatching flying enemies with bullets leaping from the muzzle of your gun.
As with many hybridized games, perhaps the greatest risk Eternal Red runs is falling short in the eyes of fans of the parent genres from which it was inspired. Strategic defense fans will likely be disappointed with the rather poor selection of available traps and upgrades, while fans of platform shooters may think that there aren't enough guns available, or the fact that the main character doesn't take damage may feel a little too much like cheating. The game is also woefully lacking in a reward system, even though the sheer variety of bad guys will keep you interested for some time. And while the lack of story allows you to focus on the gameplay, I don't think a sequel can be made without having at least a cursory explanation as to what's going on.
Eternal Red may lack the depth of either of its parent genres, it manages to find a pretty solid balance between the two, making it a brilliant little diversion to pass the time with.
Here is a word of warning: sentry guns are your friend. I didn't realize at first that they were even upgradeable, and unfortunately, as soon as I discovered that, out came the flying creatures. The ones who are impervious to acid and spikes. Aargh!
While I agree that Sentry guns are great, I have seen at least spikes do some damage to flying creatures because of how they bob up and down as they fly along. :D
I didn't realize that there even was sentry guns until well after the first flying one.
I'm at level 37 now, I have the shotgun, 2 spikes, 1 acid, 2 machine gun sentries, 1 acid sentry, and 1 grenade sentry.
This game is fun.
Once your top floor is completely fitted with 10/10/10-upgraded machinegun sentries, it becomes very simple. This is more like Tower Defense for people, who don't want to think much - but just witness mindless slaughter.
That being said, I sorta like it.
stage 60. still no end.
have 5+ 10/10/10 weapons and trying to get to the end with speed hack.
The game "ends" at level 70. You can continue to play, but there's no more bosses and it lags up a lot around level 90 when there's a million enemies and bullets flying around.
Shotgun is easily the best weapon if you can click fast enough.
I got to level 70, with four machine guns and one grenade launcher all maxed out. My first floor time was a slow tile, maxed out. Not even the level 70 boss could get past that. Most creatures were wiped out as soon as they appeared!
Then I got the option to start on a new map or continue fighting
I was bored of the game by then, so I'm going to see how long it takes to lose.
Wow, love the idea of combining shooter with TD. The only thing I feel is missing is, when you upgrade, a visible change in the weapons/grounds. But that's getting kind of nitpicky.
Good game, currently on lvl34 with top level of machine gun and nade turrets. decided acid is useless. spikes on floor.
any idea what the cashgun does?
Meh. Towering Forever tried to combine them too, and honestly they just seem more tedious to me than either a defense or a platformer game. Possibly it's because I associate the platformer bit with exploring large maps, running and jumping around rather than shooting at basically the same place and the same enemies over and over.
Nicely made for what it is, though.
This game froze after level 25. . . Twice.
I was playing on hardcore on the first stage both times.
Not exactly a walkthrough, but helpful.
Ok, the first map, which is the three floored with sentries and panels (not sure that it makes a difference what map it is), has about 74 levels till you beat the game.
The cash gun is like the machine gun turret, but it gives you money when it hits a monster, depending on the amount of upgrades to damage. 10 upgrades = 10 dollars per hit.
And a slow panel as the first panel with an acid sentry above and a machine gun behind it will decimate the monsters.
The final thing is: the sooner you kill an enemy (measured by distance, not time, hence the slow panel in the front), the more cash you get.
Alright, I thought this was a blast. Hah, get it, Blast?
Anyways, I played until... now. I am tired of shooting things myself, and I am just letting the creatures trickle their way through everything and taking away my "lives". I am sitting on level 105, $350,000+ in current cash, and just over 3000 kills. Does anyone know if this game ever like, ENDS ends? And does anything hurt the flyers besides guns?
This game is too easy and there isn't a lot of variety, but I like it anyway.
This combines two genres that lose accessibility and friendliness with each layer of complexity, so it's kind of nice to see a game combining the two use a degree of simplicity in each one.
The simplicity might be taking it too far, but games are supposed to be FUN, and the infuriatingly difficult TD games, while challenging and offering depth of gameplay, sometimes seem to be more challenging than fun.
Eternal Red presents us with most of the advantages we wish we had in those games. You don't have to deal with a lot of tedious tower-matching, you don't have to prepare for a bazillion different special abilities in each wave of creeps, money starts coming in quick so you don't have to micromanage funds just to scrape enough together to hold off the next wave, and you can actually point and click on the creeps instead of just wringing your hands while the creeps who get past your defenses get away.
This of course makes it too easy, but maybe it's better that way.
I've just told you all the things it's NOT, but you know what it IS? It's pure mass-murdering FUN. An epic "Slaughterfest '08" wrapped up in a truly awesome artistic style, a pleasing visual aesthetic and gunning down creeps by the buckets.
Don't get me wrong, I love complex, intricate, puzzle-like defense games, and intelligent tactical platform shooters. But I like games like this to unwind in between them.
there is a bug in the game that freezes gameplay. The flying enemies can somehow get stuck on the other side of the wall. you cant kill them and the enemy waves will no longer advance while its alive so your game is frozen. I've restarted but it happens every time.
I'm well annoyed. I was on level 90 something and then I accidentally clicked on one of those ads at the bottom of the game window, and it made me lose it all!
p.s. The game is wicked - simplicity+tons of money= FUN
Map with no Sentry
So, how do you beat this? It's all about the gun baby! You're going to have to be one shooting little weird guy. I started out with the shotgun right out of the gate, and one spike trap and didn't even put a slow pad down until around level 5.
Keep the gun upgraded and let the floor traps follow behind. Way behind at first. If you can't kill the flying guys with your gun by the time they appear you are done for.
Even with this, do not expect to make level 70 with all your "lives" in tact. The best I've done is down 20 lives and that's on casual.
Seems tough, but it's the best challenge this game offers imo.
with the shotty maxed out and a full row of sentries you are unbeatable
It's wicked fun even if i only started, it's like killing!!!! I have a shotgun, one machine gun, and spikes and i still goin' on.... oh yeah, + handgun, lol
I haven't been able to get the game to work in weeks. First it wouldn't load. Now it loads but when I click "Play" nothing happens. All the other buttons work (like settings, instructions, etc.). Is anyone else having this problem?
I found this game very addictive, I only wanted to play for about 10 minutes then 2 hrs pass and I'm sitting there scream DIE!
I found that having your top row all slowdow maxed. My sentrys on top row were 1 machine gun 1 grenade and 3 cash guns all maxed.
Can anyone help me? I can't seem to be able to upgrade after the first one, all that appears is the gun cursor and all it does is shoot when I try to upgrade a panel or gun. I'm afraid I'm not going to make it through the game with only a level 1 machine gun sentry and a level 1 shotty. next creature untill the first creature dies or walks out of range via dropping to second creature untill the first creature dies or walks out of range via dropping :)
by using these two tips above, i have successfully completed (lv1, casual) all 70 levels with all lives intact
im at lvl 130 i have 6 machine gun sentries,
3 grenade sentries, 4 acid sentries, 3 cash sentries (what s better about them?), machine gun, shotgun, handgun, and a pattern of slow, acid, then spike floors all maxed out with over 1.5 mil cash. >:P
Slow Traps with 10 duration keep the enemy moving at what ever slow speed you have for the next entire floor panel to follow. Acid works the same way, 10 duration means the enemy will suffer poison damage for the entire next floor panel. So putting 2 slow or 2 acid in a row is a bad idea. Spikes continue to confuse me, which does more damage; spikes or acid?
Next is the guns:
Money gun pays you $1 per point of damage in it per bullet that hits the enemy. So 10 points in Money Gun damage means every bullet to hit an enemy will pay you $10. This money however only goes toward your spending cash and not your score. The ONLY time the Cash Gun helps your score is if it shoots a BIG (or BOSS) type creature.
The acid gun continues to confuse me, does the acid gun do initial damage, or does it simply act just like a acid floor panel by starting a ticking damage over time?
Grenades are extremely effective in doing area of effect damage to ground units, however, i have not been able to figure out if they hurt fliers.
Pretty easy up to a point. If you don't buy anything else, you can fully upgrade a shotgun by level 30-35. I played twice and both times not a single creature got past even the first floor that way. Although the first time I played the reason I didn't buy anything else was because I had no idea you could, but it worked
Update
<|endofexample|>
Update 8 Jan:
Reports state that both the Blue Jays and Angels have taken the lead in the sweepstakes with offers approximating $23,000,000. If true, it would leave all other offers rumoured in the dust and would make Aroldis decide between the 2, assuming no other team comes up with a better offer before one is agreed to.
Update 7 Jan:
It was brought to my attention that the Jays may actually be leading the race for Chapman due to 3 very important reasons.
1 – Canada has friendly relations with Cuba, whereas the United States do not. If Aroldis values his family and wants to bring them to North America, Canada is the easier country to do it with, obviously.
2 – Alex Anthopoulos returns from his honeymoon tomorrow, the exact day Aroldis hinted a deal could be completed and announced – pending physical of course, unless it was already done during the private scouting session.
3 – The Jays were the ONLY team to ask for and receive a private session which proves 2 things: Aroldis and his agent are willing to sign with Toronto, and the Jays proved their serious interest and presumably let Aroldis know he was their #1 priority.
The Aroldis Chapman sweepstakes have made me realize one major point about the Blue Jays: They lack International presence on their roster despite spending lots of money in the Dominican and in Venezuela. I realized this when it was mentioned that the presence of Kendry Morales on the Angels was a lure for Aroldis to sign there instead of going elsewhere. It also reminded me that Hedo Turkogulu signed with the Raptors specifically because the Turkish community was so strong in numbers within Toronto, while passing up more money from other teams.
The current 40-man roster for the Jays holds only 5 International players:
- Reidier Gonzalez – Cuba
- Jose Bautista – Dominican Republic
- Luis Perez – Dominican Republic
- Edwin Encarnacion – Dominican Republic
- Alex Gonzalez - Venzuela
The remainder are all from the United States or Canada. That makes the International presence on the Jays 12.5% on the 40-man roster. For a quick comparison, the Red Sox currently have 12 International players for a 30% total. Does this make them the better team just because they have International presence? No, it’s obviously not that simple. But, if a Japanese player like Yu Darvish was looking to sign with an MLB club, would he be more likely to accept a deal to the Red Sox who have 3 prominent Japanese players, or the Jays who have none? This is exactly the reason why Alex should be willing to overpay slightly in order to get someone like Chapman on board, it sets the table for future signings and attracts other International players to follow suit.
I’ll take the lack of International presence one step further. Only 2 of the top 10 Jays prospects listed by Baseball America were International players – SP Henderson Alvarez (Venezuela) and C Carlos Perez (Venezuela). Both of these players are a direct result of the Blue Jays spending the money needed within Venezuela to scout players appropriately. Shouldn’t they be doing the same thing elsewhere? What about Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and most obviously – the Dominican Republic?
Alex obviously had this on his mind when he expanded the scouting capacity of the Blue Jays and I definitely hope it bears fruit, because the Jays can definitely use a lot more International talent on their roster. However, as it stands today, the best opportunity for the Jays to begin the process of adding International presence on the roster starts with signing Aroldis Chapman. Once that’s done, the Jays need to make sure that they spend the money on scouting Aroldis type players early in order to sign them before they display their full potential.
Here’s to hoping the Jays can pull this one off!
Topics: Aroldis Chapman, Edwin Encarnacion, Jose Bautista, Luis Perez, Reidier Gonzalez

I got this shirt for Jazzie last year. When I saw it, I just thought it was so appropriate for her. However, last year she would not wear it. She thought it was "too embarrassing", because it was too big. This year on the other hand, it fits her nicely and when Jazzie saw it in her closet earlier today, she wanted to wear it.
I talked a little bit to Jazzie about why I thought this shirt was so perfect for her. When I first found out that Jazzie was deaf, I didn't think she would ever talk. Then, after she received her cochlear implants, I wasn't sure how well she was going to talk.
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that Jazzie would end up speaking so clearly that people don't even realize she is deaf upon meeting her.
I hope that Jazzie understands how proud I am of her. This shirt may just be a cute/funny shirt to her, but when I see her wearing it I am filled with pride and amazement at how much she has accomplished.
I love it! So perfect!

Trance Atlantic (Boom Bop II)
Double Moon the late Lester Bowie's brother, trombonist Joseph Bowie. Bourelly, an exceptional guitar player who has an impressive recording history of more than 20 years, doesn't waste any of the talent he has amassed on Trance-Atlantic.
A sequel to 2001's Boom-Bop, this new CD is funk and jazz-rock stretched to their natural limits. If it isn't Bourelly's boastful playing that consumes you, then the vocals provided by Abdourahmane Diop will. Diop, the son of a griot (storyteller) from Senegal has plenty to say on songs that embrace and seek tradition and culture like "Cool Papa N'Diaye" and "Fatima." But complex funk-rock with world rhythms is what you get mostly here, and on songs like "The Spirit Wheel," the strong rhythms powered by Bourelly's caustic guitar playing takes over completely. Jean-Paul and his brother Carl are all about conjuring their music at times, too, and Bourelly is capable of invoking the Midwestern electric blues of Chuck Berry and the progressive rhythm and blues of Jimi Hendrix. "Blowin' Omni," a tune that recalls some of Miles Davis' fast-paced fusion on albums like The Man With the Horn, is superb.
Strangely, Trance-Atlantic isn't a guitar recording; the album's fine horn players take it over. Bourelly's hard edges never cease, but there is no need for an apology even though this music can wear on you some. But on "Harmofunkalodica" Bourelly proves again and again that he deserves the space to stretch out behind any and all capable beats. His playing is clean and crisp; his band only makes him sound mightier.

Australia was a new country and maintained a ‘White Australia Policy’. This policy, amongst others, effectively allowed for the preference of British migrants over all others through the first decades of the 20th century.
After the attack and threat of invasion by the Japanese, and a new awareness of Australia’s vulnerability, the Australian government began the ‘Populate or Perish’ policy. Under this assisted migration scheme, citizens from all Commonwealth countries were recruited to immigrate to Australia. This was known colloquially as the ‘Ten Pound Pom’ scheme.
Later, the scheme was extended to immigrants from northern European countries with the belief that they would more easily assimilate with the Australian community. After World War Two, Australia also welcomed refugees from war-torn Europe who were known as ‘Displaced Persons’.
The second wave of post-war immigration arrived in the 1950s and 1960s. These included migrants from Italy, Greece, Malta, Croatia and Turkey.
Unfortunately many of the British settlers saw the newcomers as foreigners. The term ‘wogs’ amongst others, was used frequently.
The native peoples or aboriginals who had been treated harshly and imprisoned in the early years of settlement, had more hardship placed upon them. ‘Half-caste’ Aboriginal children - those of mixed breeding -were forcibly removed from their parents and institutionalised. The problems associated with these actions are still prevalent in today’s society. These persons are known as the ‘Stolen Generation’.
Child migration schemes for underprivileged British children in Canada, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and Australia promised a better life, and parents were persuaded to sign over legal guardianship of their children. These children as well as orphans and indigenous children were badly treated and abused, and are known as the ‘Forgotten Australians.’
In my first two novels, I have used this history as a backdrop for my stories. Growing up in ‘white’ Australia as children/young people of immigrant parents, my characters struggle to find their place and acceptance in a highly prejudiced society. In an era of so-called progress, being torn between two cultures was both unsettling and problematic.
‘Heart’s Promise’ begins in the mid 1970’s and ‘Where The Heart Is’ continues to the early 1980’s. They are two individual stories of emotional struggle, loss, acceptance and love.
Set in my hometown, I have added a little local history to help the reader get the feel of small town life.
Once a quiet rural area, the town is on the verge of change. The arrival of a large American mining company is the beginning of the region’s transformation. But that’s another story…
Thanks for a really interesting post on Australian history. Concise and eye-opening!
Thank you :)

No news (is good news) from Archie. We get him back tomorrow. Here is a picture of him on the doorstep on Monday morning, about to experience British education. "Smart casual", they said. That's his anxious mother, behind.
Yesterday evening when I switched on the kitchen light, the bulb fell from the socket. It didn’t shatter, and for half an hour or so I felt happy about that. Then I began to wonder whether I will be able to get the metal bit out of the holder in order to replace it. I’ll postpone getting the steps out and going up to have a look, until I’ve had my porridge. Life is frot with problems.
Knitting
Yesterday I was looking at a knitting magazine in my bath, as is my wont, and had a Thot. What if I abandoned Effortless and Vitamin D alike, and used that madelinetosh yarn to knit Roberta Rosenfeld’s very simple and very clever sweater, No. 12 in the Winter 11-12 VK?
(If you go to Ravelry and search on “Roberta Rosenfeld” you won’t find it, but “drape-front sweater” will get it. It took me a while to work that out. You probably have the magazine anyway.)
I am worried about the gauge for the Effortless. It is written for madelinetosh DK, remember, but she wants me to use 5.5mm needles and get a gauge of 19 stitches to 4”. I’m knitting the v-neck vest on 4mm and getting 20-22 stitches to 4” as the ballband says. I don’t like knitting with big needles – will I be happy with 5.5? And I like the fabric I’m getting – do I want it looser?
Vitamin D is written for sport-weight yarn. Not an insuperable difficulty, of course.
But VK No. 12, written for alpaca, wants 5 stitches to the inch. I think I could achieve that. Try a swatch on 4.5 mm maybe. I think madelinetosh has a native droopiness which would go well in an alpaca pattern. The pattern sounds straightforward, and also sounds as if it could be tweaked if necessary to accommodate the gauge I was actually getting. The Ravelers who have knit it are very happy with it, and look nice wearing it. That is not always the case.
The v-neck vest got on well yesterday. Lying about, waiting to be picked up and worked on, it now looks like a sweater, and a rather nice one. I remember when Thomas-the-Elder’s Brownstone (madelinetosh scarlet, late last year) began to look like that.
Knit Now
Shandy, I am ashamed not to have thanked you. Three people sent me copies. I was very touched, and am very grateful. It is an interesting idea for a magazine (small knits only). I don’t think I want to go on with it but I am glad to have seen it, and will have another very thorough look before committing myself on the snood front.
For the metal bit still stuck in the light socket? Use a potato! It won't conduct electricity well and you won't be injured by any glass that might be left. You just stuff the potato into the opening until it "catches" on the metal of the lightbulb. You then just turn the potato until the lightbulb remnants come out. I know it sounds pretty silly, but it's a tried and true method.
I concur with Anonymous' suggestion to use a potato to remove the metal bit from the socket. It seems to be the classic method!

Jean, you may well get your 19 st to 4" with a 4.5mm
needle, if you're getting 20 st to 4" with a 4mm.
Potato OR needle-nose pliers, BUT, turn the power off first (of course)
(I've heard carrot instead of potato...)
Good gracious - Archie looks so tall! I must have seriously misjudged his age, or his mom is quite petite...
The whole idea of boarding school is foreign to us in California - I am looking forward to his report after a week.

Greetings from Music City! And thank you for visiting the blog. So many new things have happened to me in the past couple of months, that I figured it was appropriate to venture into two more new things these past couple of days — Twitter and the blogosphere.
I want to begin by saying that while I hope this blog will become a regular in your Websites I Have to Visit Often rotation, I will admit to you that I have no idea exactly what this blog will become. Blogging is something I’ve thought about doing for a long time…not because I think I have tremendous insight that I simply must share with the “world,” but rather I really enjoy writing and do not do it as often as I’d like. So, I think this blog will satisfy my craving to write. What will it do for you? I have no idea, and I’m excited about that. It would be very easy to say this blog will be where you can go to read strictly about the Nashville Sounds, the Brewers’ Triple-A affiliate for whom I began working last month. Or it could be a blog specifically about baseball broadcasting. Or about the Pacific Coast League and the cities and stadiums the Sounds travel to this season. Or about working in Minor League Baseball. Or about news and notes from around the major leagues. My hope, though, is that on some level you want the blog to be about all of those things and more, not just one. If that’s the case, then we’re on the same page. While I haven’t written a blog before today, I’ve certainly read those of others, and my inspiration was to create a blog that, while you’re waiting for the latest post to load, has you thinking, “I wonder what’s on here today.” If it were one dimensional, my guess is you’d have little interest in returning.
Overall, the blog will be centered around three of my greatest passions: baseball, radio and baseball on the radio (hence the blog title and the background image). I hope you enjoy it, and I hope from time to time you’ll leave a comment, ask a question, suggest a blog topic, etc.
Thanks for listening! (On the Air…and Off)
Jeff

Welcome aboard, Jeff. We’re happy to have you as part of the team this season and can’t wait for our great fans to get to know you.

Gamification in Education
Kendra is a sophomore taking an introductory course in forestry. Professor Sievert divides the class into teams of six students each and hands out a list of 100 plants found in the nearby national forest. Each team is responsible for finding photos and information about these plants, familiarizing themselves with them, and ensuring that they can identify them on location. The teams have two weeks to collect all the information they can and to quiz one another on plant recognition.
Then, two weeks from Friday, Sievert explains, teams will compete in a contest in a specified area of the nearby national forest to see which team can provide the most and best identifications in a two-hour window. Teams will win “identification points,” and the team with the most points will win tokens allowing each every member to turn in any one paper up to 48 hours late during the term.
Kendra and her team gather with their cell phones in hand half an hour early on the day of the contest. This gives them a few minutes to look over the rule sheets as Sievert distributes them. Rules are fairly straightforward. “Correct identification” consists of a photo of the plant with a team member standing beside it, sent by cell phone to a designated dropbox. These photos must arrive with a message giving the name of the plant and appropriate metadata. A standard plant on the list is worth 10 points; one marked “rare” is worth 25. There are also 5-point bonuses for a plant photographed in bloom, one correctly identified as suitable for human food, or one identified as toxic. Any misidentifications will subtract the number of points from the team total they would have added had they been correct.
Kendra’s team decides to separate into three groups of two each. When the starting whistle blows, Kendra and Jacob set out as partners to find, photograph, and identify. The cell phones are busy snapping pictures, receiving images from other team members for confirmation, and submitting photos to the dropbox. There are also several calls to coordinate team progress. At the end of two hours, the teams meet back at the gathering place. The unofficial tabulation suggests Kendra’s team has won by 5 points. She’s glad to learn that her team will be competing in similar contests throughout the term.
1. What is it?
Gamification is the application of game elements in non-gaming situations, often to motivate or influence behavior. In business contexts, gamification is used to create an engaging dynamic—such as the points system created by Weight Watchers— and to build brand loyalty. It also has wide currency in organizations where it may be used to encourage member or employee interest in projects or organizational efforts. In academe, gamification typically employs elements such as points, badges, or progress bars to engage or motivate students in the learning process. Whereas building a full-scale game requires the design and construction of a holistic, systematic environment to house the project, successful gamification can involve no more than the employment of a few feedback or reward elements. That said, the practice is most effective as a pedagogical tool where it forms part of a well-planned strategy to encourage research, inspire creativity, teach basic principles, or hone problem-solving skill.
2. How does it work?
Many instructors implement gamification because they
believe the rewards or the spirit of competition will spur students’ concentration and interest and lead to more effective learning. On the surface, these rewards may include items such as physical tokens, badges, or points toward a long-term goal. Students may strive to “win” recognition among their peers or the larger community or engage for personal satisfaction or a simple sense of accomplishment. But beneath these game-like prizes lies another level of reward that may include relevant feedback, learning reinforcement, and a lively and collaborative class environment. While technology is not essential to gamification, it can make management simpler. Many faculty use technology to track accomplishments, total points, and aggregate results. In addition, gamification elements can happen both inside and outside the classroom.
3. Who’s doing it?
The use of gamification is wide ranging in higher education, whether adapted from publicly available applications, designed by individual instructors, or created by departmental staff. Students at Pepperdine University’s business school, for example, are currently piloting a free web-based gamification tool called Veri. The product invites participants to test themselves on course topics using questions the instructor has entered. Game-like overtones include immediate humorous feedback and a running scoreboard for students to track their success. As they progress through various levels, a leader board sparks competition by showing who has the highest scores. In an economics course at Penn State, an instructor-designed example that ties content to play asks “So You Want to Be a Millionaire?” The syllabus notifies students that grades are for sale and explains that the primary way to acquire capital is by answering multiple-choice questions correctly, in this case on the course exams.
Not every use of gamification in academe is tied to coursework. Metadata Games at Dartmouth College arose from a critical need in the college archives. Vast photo repositories were being left unused by researchers because they lacked metadata necessary for effective searches. In response, a Dartmouth design team built a game-style interface that invited students to tag archived images either as a solo activity or in two-player game-like scenarios. The pilot phase alone netted over 6,000 image tags from players, suggesting that this kind of implementation may have intriguing potential for archivists and curators.
4. Why is it significant?
Adding game components to a course can result in several real benefits. Simulations can help students sharpen an ability or work out a novel solution, while a game-style patina may present coursework more as a challenge than a chore. But perhaps the most commonly cited benefit of gamification is that it fosters student engagement, often cited by the National Survey of Student Engagement as a key to increasing student retention. Where it functions well, gamification facilitates the formation of learning communities, giving new opportunities online or during course discussions to socialize or work as teams. In this sense, gamification has the potential to help build connections among members of the academic community, drawing in shy students, supporting collaboration, and engendering interest in course content that students might not have otherwise explored.
5. What are the downsides?
Some stakeholders feel any introduction of game elements trivializes learning content. At the same time, students may see game elements as condescending or feel disappointed and frustrated when their application is not successful or does not yield the kind of satisfaction from winning that they expect. The competitive element that intrigues some students may discourage others, particularly those who have trouble with course content. They may feel the competition introduces another level of complexity or that it will reveal their difficulties in understanding the content to the rest of the class.
Gamification can be deceptively difficult to employ effectively, and examples of failed efforts are not hard to find. For example, awarding points to students whose blog entries garner the most responses might encourage some bloggers to enlist their friends to comment, without regard to quality, their drive being the extrinsic rewards rather than the quality of the work they submit. In addition, careful thought must be given to the administrative details of gamification lest instructors be overwhelmed by the workload of tracking student progress through points, tokens, badges, and other game elements.
6. Where is it going?
The use of technology in gamificaiton has given rise to several grants from sources such as Next Generation Learning Challenges and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Such support for gamification is likely to encourage more complex, technology- based, interactive scenarios that extend beyond individual classrooms. In fact, gamification is already moving toward institutional uses, in implementations such as “Just Press Play,” debuting at the Rochester Institute of Technology this fall. This university-wide instance of gamification is structured to involve students in all aspects of the student community experience. They earn badges for activities such as going to the gym for the first time or getting A’s during a term, but the awards are part of an integrated approach to engage them throughout the four-year program. Similar projects employed at a departmental or institutional level might serve many cross-disciplinary purposes to help students construct portfolios, build organizations, or derive artistic or business solutions that could bridge the space between the educational experience and career achievement.
7. What are the implications for teaching and learning?
While the term “gamification” is of fairly recent coinage, the use of game elements to teach is certainly not new. Instructors have long understood that interactive experiences engage student imaginations and increase motivation. Gamification offers instructors numerous creative opportunities to enliven their instruction with contests, leader boards, or badges that give students opportunities for recognition and a positive attitude toward their work. These elements of play take advantage of the human desire to compete and socialize, as well as to measure progress toward clear goals, allowing individuals to compete against themselves. Where they are employed thoughtfully and effectively, game elements can engage and motivate students, encourage exploration, foster independent effort, and generate unexpected solutions to the problems posed by course content.

Read Together starts tomorrow. The linky will be up at midnight Eastern (HERE it is), but I thought I'd go ahead and put up my own post as a reminder and to give you some ideas.
But at the core, I'm a selfish Mommy, which means that I don't read to them as much as I would like to. Amanda is such a self-motivated reader, and so I don't need to read aloud to her to keep her interested, but because we both love books, sharing books together is a natural venue that we should use to connect.
This we do -- but not enough. Since I told all of you in the guidelines to make a goal that will challenge yourselves, I am going to stretch myself as well.
- We were reading Uglies aloud last month, but we came to a halt with that. So, since she's already read it, I am going to commit to finishing it on my own.
- She just started The Moon by Night, by Madeleine L'Engle, which I have started as well, so I think we'll be able to finish that one this month. We both read Meet the Austins last month (click the link to read our review). It's been nice to discover that series together.
- Pieces of Georgia is a Nutmeg selection (our state's book award). She enjoys reading them, and when I saw that this one was free verse, I thought it would be an absolute perfect read-aloud. I checked it out from the library today, and was reading the first few pages to myself, and I got excited about the poetical feel of the language.
- Along those same lines, when I read Amy's post about The Invention of Hugo Cabret (which I've been wanting to read for ages) it struck me that it would be a perfect read-aloud as well. I have visions of snuggling up with her, both of us looking at the pictures. The concept of a picture book for older kids is intriguing, and again, fits perfectly with the idea of connecting over books.
- I had originally put Wings on the list, but I think that the two I listed above will be better as read-alouds, so perhaps this will go on our simultaneous reading list, but I'd be surprised if I got through this in April.
- Amanda is really enjoying Wendy Mass' books, so she's invited me to read 11 Birthdays, which I'd like to do as well.
Now how will I do this? Well for one thing I have to commit to the books that we are reading together, yet separately. Since I'm halfway through both of them, I know that I can do that, but it does involve putting aside some of my own picks.
The second way is to find new times to read aloud with Amanda. As I mentioned, I've been reading to her in the mornings as she eats breakfast and fixes her lunch. I want to keep that up, and perhaps read to her a few evenings a week (she usually reads to herself before bed).
Another way to squeeze in more time with Amanda is to find books that she, Kyle and I can all read together. We are currently reading Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle -- but honestly we've stalled there too. See why I need this challenge??
I'm also going to try to read The Incredible Journey to them. It is short-ish (160 pages), which is always good for a read-aloud, but I don't know if it has enough action to keep Kyle interested. Does anyone else remember this book from elementary school? I have selected it as my "dog story" pick for April's Children's Classics at 5 Minutes for Books.
I am focusing my Read Together goals on Amanda and on finding things that the three of us can read together. I will try to bump up my reading with Kyle as well, but I feel much better about those practices right now. We always read a fair amount before naptime and before bedtime.
However, since it looks like naptime is really falling by the wayside (he still needs one or two a week), I want to commit to read with him on no-nap days as well. Perhaps I'll read with him even longer on a no-nap day.
********
Link up your goals for April this week. Read the introduction post if you need more info.

Great goals, Jennifer. And I'm impressed with how many books you hope/plan to read with Amanda (either out loud or together-but-separate). I've been curious about the Hugo Cabret book, so I'll look forward to your thoughts, and Amanda's too.
I had never really thought about the importance of connecting this way as your kids get older and reading the same books as they are. I definitely want to keep that going as my son grows up.
Thank you!!
That’s looks so nice your posting.
Everything looks good in your posting.
That will be necessary for all. Thanks for your posting.

Holly
At the weekend I collected holly sprigs for decoration and the little displays made me happy. I adore holly - not just its shiny, deep green, spiky leaves and red, red berries (which are beautiful), but it impresses more deeply. Of course it is inextricably linked with Christmas festivities and celebrations.
Holly Scraperboard
For the Pagans holly represented the spirit of vegetation and the waning forces of nature, and the male counterpart to the female ivy - it has become part of customs and superstitions the world over, not only for winter solstace celebrations.
It is a remarkable tree, the close-grained white wood is used for making tool handles and the holly's male and female flowers are found on separate trees, and the berries exclusively on the female tree.
In Roman times sweets were hung from twigs of holly and given as gifts - although to cut down a holly was very unlucky, and also to cut a branch which instead should be pulled off.
Holly carved in Yorkstone
The red berries have long been believed to ward off evil spirits and demons and holly trees and hedges were planted round houses for protection. The holly is also thought to protect from lightening strikes. Pythagoras mentions the power of holly in that the flowers could solidify water and describes the strange controlling properties of holly to draw people to it, bound to touch it and then are made weak. Pliny writes that an animal hit with a holly stick will be subdued and compelled to obey the wielder of the stick - horses are particularly affected.
In the North of England it was believed that if nine leaves of smooth-leaved holly were placed under the pillow, it would result in prophetic dreams! This I am going to try - I'll let you know the results.

There is a long list of natural phenomena and human inventions that lurked on the fringes of science before they became officially credible. At the end of the 18th century, the French Academy of Sciences said with impeccable Gallic logic that, as there were no rocks in the sky, no rocks could fall from the sky. In 1803, more than two thousand meteorites fell on a village in Normandy – after that, and an investigation by the scientist Jean-Baptiste Biot, the Academy was less sniffy. The eminent scientist Lord Kelvin said that Roentgen’s X-rays were a hoax. Edison’s electric lamp was declared an impossibility, and because it was an impossibility his fellow researchers wouldn’t go to see it even when Edison used it to light up the streets around his laboratory. From 1904, the Wright brothers made flights over fields bordered by a main highway and a railway line in Ohio: but though hundreds of people saw them in the air, the local press failed to publish reports because they didn’t believe the witnesses, and didn’t send their own witnesses because it couldn’t be true. Two years after their first flight, Scientific American dismissed the feats of the flying brothers; if there had been anything in it, the journal said, wouldn’t the local press have picked it up?
But maybe it’s easier now to evade taboos and get a hearing for nonsense. The internet has so vastly increased the potency of urban legends, so quickened the circulation of rumours, that we may soon be the most deluded generation ever born. It seems strange that some scientists are so angry with the sacred books of old-time religions, when so many challenges to rationality are generated by half-understood, miscommunicated information, much of it masquerading as science, available online and in the press. The internet is the great source of light and of darkness; it trashes the status of knowledge, undermines its ownership, and scants the principle of editing and review. The laconic conventions that govern online communication favour the proliferation of irony, of a two-way split of meaning in every line, so that the knowing prevail effortlessly over the naive. Fleeting and flitting, self-generating, double-faced, the internet is the natural home for anomalous phenomena, which have a primitive quality, yet track social paradigms; like science fiction, they dance like sprites around the scientific consensus, sometimes seeming to follow, sometimes to lead, sometimes to head off by themselves into an ancient inner landscape.
Until the idea of space flight became credible, there were no aliens; instead there were green men who hid in the woods. In the same way, psychotic delusions keep up with scientific change: the people once pursued by phantasms of the dead are now pestered by living celebrities who watch them from inside their TV sets, and those who used to confess themselves possessed now say there is a bomb inside them. The dictionary attests to the power and antiquity of the need to believe we are sharing the planet with beings not animal and not human, with ‘little greys’ from spacecraft, with goblins and domestic deities: beings who suspend the laws of nature wherever they pop up, and suspend moral laws too, for household sprites and pucks often have a fierce, childlike sense of justice, and retaliate without fear if they are slighted; aliens who want sex never ask nicely..

Paranormalists from Toronto
At the LRB, Hilary Mantel has an engaging piece on the Chambers Dictionary of the Unexplained:
I like the description of the Internet as "the great source of light and of darkness."
The piece is also enjoyable for the sheer fun you can tell that Mantel had in writing it: she's reveling in words without letting them take over, almost like they're one of the paranormal forces she's writing about. What fun!

Berlin Wall in Our Backyard
We, as a young and uninformed nation, used to have the excuse that we did not know about our politicians' overarching self-interest that far outweighed reason, integrity, and the well-being of our nation and, indeed, the world. Information did not break and spread so efficiently. Now it does. We have watched it all play out before us. We have shrugged, sighed, and shaken our heads. We have had no effect.
We watch as our lawmakers blatantly mock their duties to us to pander to extremists and the uninformed in preparation for an election almost upon us. They transparently use taxpayer money to fund partisan campaign stops, masquerading as open hearings, and we roll our eyes. They have taken the easiest route of no debate, of over-simplistic treatment of a complicated and important issue to ensure that they, both as individuals and as political parties, hold or gain seats at the polls.
This would be shameful enough were the effects of such behavior merely political. They are not. Our ignorantly drawn border long ago split at least one nation -- the Tohono O'odham -- that existed before ours. Our enforcement of inappropriate and insufficient immigration laws has disrupted the natural migrant cycles and increased the undocumented population of this country that it purported to eliminate. And instead of recognizing this, thinking, and changing tactics, we will continue to exacerbate the situation. We will dig the hole deeper at the expense of taxpayer dollars and human lives.
This new fencing -- if it can be built through the harsh desert landscape of ravines and rivers and jagged mountain peaks that stretch along the border -- will leave 1,300 miles of our southern border uncovered. That's 1,300 miles of borderlands in which people will attempt to cross and continue to perish in the wilderness -- and 1,300 miles of borderlands through which our undocumented population should continue to grow. And that's if this particular show of commitment to "security" lasts beyond election day: Congress has approved only $1.2 billion of the $6 billion it's estimated the fence will cost, according to The Post.
The argument that this wall will help secure us from terrorism also fails. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), who until this past week stood for more comprehensive immigration reform, claims this wall will help fight terrorism: "'Fortifying our borders is an integral component of national security,' Frist said. 'We can't afford to wait.'" (WP)
But not even in the Tucson sector of the border, which has seen the highest migrant flows, has Border Patrol encountered even a hint of terrorist activity, according to Sam Lucio, a Supervising Agent for that sector. We have, however, heard of terrorist action on airplanes and even an alleged terror cell in Detroit. Perhaps we should ground all planes and wall up the Motor City. It worked so well for Berlin.
With the passage of this bill -- and the possible re-elections of the pandering politicians who seek to enact it -- hostilities, xenophobia, and ambient fear will continue to grow among us, as will our undocumented population and the death tolls of migrants. Everyone stands for disappointment except the politicians looking to keep their jobs -- and the already booming human-smuggling business that will surely boom even harder with this new measure. These men and women on Capitol Hill are our public servants, yet we are serving them. With this bill, the American people lose.

Several months ago there was a sale at a school and up for grabs were bookshelves, desks, instruments and a million other things. We went, of course, and found three desks for the girls. Problem was they would not all fit in the back of the truck. I came home and hooked up the trailer (a very proud and physically tiring task!) and returned to the sale. The man who helped me load commented that he had never seen a woman tie down cargo quite as well as I had. Proud moment number two! After a successful drive home, I approached the driveway and faced a great obstacle: backing the trailer into the driveway.
I have watched my husband do this over the last 13 years and I remember the ‘steer in the opposite direction’ concept from driver’s ed. classes, but this was the first time I had actually attempted backing up a trailer on my own.
After several failed attempts and even more positive encouragement from my daughters, I did manage to back it in. While learning how to do this, I was completely blocking traffic on our street and had more than one offer from a man to just to it for me. Stubbornness runs fiercely through my blood, and I politely said, “No. I have to learn how to do this.” Luckily, the men just waited patiently in their trucks and laughed at my many comical moves.
My pride was a bit bruised by their laughter, I’ll admit, but when I did finally succeed, those lovely men actually cheered for me. That was worth all the work!
A few days later, my middle daughter was working on a new math concept, her most difficult subject. Working together, she could solve the problems well. But as soon as she was on her own, she forgot what to do next. And so I would model the process again, this time asking her to figure the steps along the way. On her own once more, she would trip and fail. We were both frustrated and I didn’t know what else to do.
“I think you just need to try these on your own. Do one problem then show me. We can figure out the mistakes together, but you need to give this a go.”
She did not like the idea. “What if I get it wrong?”
Ah-ha! That was the problem. Children are afraid to make mistakes and adults are quick to jump and respond too harshly.
Children need a safe place to learn, explore, make mistakes and succeed. There is a line from the movie, Megamind when Titan, the bad guy, tells Megamind that he always fails. Megamind responds with, “I might fail, but I’ve learned from my mistakes.” And he proceeds in successfully defeating the bad guy. (I apologize if that’s a spoiler for anyone!)
I reminded her of that line in the movie. “We learn the most when we try and fail. Sometimes learning what doesn’t work is more important than learning what does. Thomas Edison, in inventing the light bulb, said he found a thousand ways that it didn’t work. He needed to find only one way that did.” (another movie line! Thank you National Treasure!)
“Like when you backed up the trailer?” she remembered. “Those men wanted to help you, but you said no.”
“And now I know how.”
My parents always told me that parenting was a more difficult than growing up because you re-live all the emotions that your children feel. How true! I’ve also discovered that children are learning how to be adults. If, as parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and friends we can embrace a child’s mistakes and use them to enhance their understanding of this world and how they fit in, we are creating a future of people who can pass along the tradition of knowing the value of the ‘try and try again’ principle. The moms and dads of the world also need opportunities to completely fall on their faces and get back up. What would happen if we forgave a friend who made a grievous mistake that hurt us? Or what would happen if we gave a co-worker, who should know better, the opportunity to re-do a botched project?
In a nut shell, children are being schooled on the idea of adulthood. Adults are taking the test.

It looked for a time that House Majority Leader Dick Armey had saved us from the Ashcroft-Bush Operation TIPS (Terrorism Information and Prevention System) program that would have sent millions of truckers, utility workers, meter readers and other service personnel to report "suspicious" behavior or other signs of terrorist-connected activity.
Armey removed from the Homeland Security Department bill this plan, characterized by constitutional lawyer John Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, as "essentially turning the average citizen into an extension of the thought police."
This army of untrained informants, without any definition of "suspicious" or "terrorist" activity, would, as conservative Georgia Republican Congressman Bob Barr said, be involved in what "smacks of the very type of fascist or Communist government we fought so hard to eradicate in other countries in decades past."
The House passed its bill without Operation TIPS, but the Senate is still debating the measure. John Ashcroft, appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, was met with Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch's concern that, "We don't want to see a '1984' Orwellian-type situation here where neighbors are reporting on neighbors."
Ashcroft satisfied Hatch by saying that these vast reports by informants would not be logged into a Justice Department database. Ashcroft conceded, however, that the information would be sent to other law-enforcement agencies that could put the allegations into their databases. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the attorney general: "We could be vigilant, but we don't want to be vigilantes."
Leahy then sent a letter to Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., head of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, which is handling the Homeland Security Department bill, asking him to include in the Senate version Armey's prohibition on enacting the ubiquitous Operation TIPS. With its echoes of the neighborhood watch committees in Cuba, China and other anti-Democratic countries, I find it reckless that an attorney general of the United States could even advocate it.
Lieberman, not notably passionate about civil liberties -- like Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to whom the Leahy letter was also addressed -- ignored his colleague's attempt to prevent this country from forgetting why we are fighting terrorism here and abroad. On July 28, New York Times reporter Alison Mitchell accurately summarized the lessons of history that the Bush administration, Congress and the rest of us must heed:
"A central challenge a free society faces in countering terrorism is in maintaining its own character, protecting its citizens while preserving what makes the society worth protecting in the first place."
Prior to Ashcroft's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, David Carle, Leahy's press secretary, sent out a "News Backgrounder," which has been ignored by much of the press. Providing "a disturbing historical precedent for Operation TIPS," the report notes that in World War I, the "Department of Justice established the American Protective League (APL), which enrolled 250,000 citizens in at least 600 cities and towns" to enlist informants with wide access in their communities to report suspicious conduct and interrogate fellow citizens. "The APL spied on workers and unions in thousands of industrial plants with defense contracts, and organized raids on German-language newspapers."
Members of the APL, with the power to make arrests, "used such methods as tar and feathers, beatings, and forcing those who were suspected of disloyalty to kiss the flag." Said the New York Bar Association after the war, "No other cause contributed so much to the oppression of innocent men as the systematic and indiscriminate agitation against what was claimed to be an all-pervasive system of German espionage."
In September, when Congress returns, a conference committee of the House and Senate will decide the final language in the Homeland Security Department bill, including whether Operation TIPS will become law. Those of us who believe American citizens should not be spying on one another can let our representatives in the Senate know that we are committed to protecting our liberties both from terrorists and from Ashcroft's Justice Department.
Separate messages should be sent to Tom Daschle and Trent Lott, the nation's leaders in the Senate.

Yes, Justin Bieber is technically 18 years old, but it's hard to let go of him as that baby-faced angel-sprite that used to croon "I thought that you'd always be mi-ine, miiii-ine" to his tween ex-girlfriend at the local Toronto bowling alley, while Ludacris and Drake looked on in approval (you know, normal kid stuff).
Bieber, however, has moved forward and would very much like us to accept that he is now a man with real man feelings and real man needs. First there was his paternity lawsuit, then there was the time he tried a beer once and now this. During a recent interview with Q Magazine, the "Boyfriend" singer made it very clear that he is a (shudder) sexual being to the point where he even has preferred sexy lady parts:
"I think I'm a butt guy. I just like butts. I'm attracted to them. Do I have any favourites? Nicki Minaj has got a nice one."
Well, there you have it. Also: barf.

Description
The new method __$swapInit was added (I think) to support reloading, enabling someone to drive re-initialization of some state (like constants, callsite arrays). Unfortunately it doesn't quite do that - with regards to the callsite array all it does is call $getCallSiteArray. This doesn't clear it, this just ensures it is initialized - and if initialized in the past it will not be reinitialized. This means the reloader has to additionally null the callsite array before calling __$swapInit - which is a shame since it is all invoked by reflection.

New Bed Means It’s Time to Redecorate
A New Bed = Clean Slate
Marriage and a new bed! Lots of excitement in my world lately!
I got married, on May 19th, I thought that once that was over things would start calming down a bit… I was totally wrong!
We received a NEW bedroom suit for our wedding gift, and we also got a new bed a SLEEP NUMBER BED!! YAY!
We had to completely de-clutter our room, I mean seriously cleaning. I moved in with my husband (so.. strange still to say) about 3 years ago. I still had boxes to unpack. Things not needed or old or just trash. I believe we cleared out over 15 bags of stuff.
It was not like an episode of Hoarders. But there was just stuff. Clothing, art supplies, pictures, books, more clothes…
We got the first round done in last Monday afternoon. Which was awesome! YAY US!
I went last Sunday (6/3) to IKEA with my sister, we pulled all the furniture that we wanted to order. Paid for it then took it over to home delivery.(I will say if you are thinking its better to have them deliver your stuff, just pull it then have them deliver, it is a next day delivery instead of 2 weeks, and a few bucks cheaper.)
Monday rolled around and the items delivered, the IKEA guys took it upstairs into the bedroom. Which was a plus because one of the boxes was over 150 pounds.. and that would have not been fun to try to take upstairs. It weighted more than I do.
So now with our cleared out room, we moved the mattress and box-springs off the bed-frame and set them aside. You can see why we needed a new bed, this set was my husbands since he was like 13 years old. It was not comfortable at all to sleep on, we actually were sleeping on the living room couches for the last few months. BOO.. so it was the best gift we could have ever asked for. Thank you Omi and Luis!
Yes this is what our cats have done to the poor old bed. I show you because I should, am I embarrassed? YES but its life
Seriously swept the carpet and started putting things together. The first thing was the new dresser for Jermie. MALM makes amazing stuff, very modern and sturdy. We were able to put it together in about 2 hours. (Ms Jolie approved… my kitty)
Then Jermie had to go to work.. and me already in the mood to get the bedroom complete, I started putting the new bed-frame together, which was also MALM and a platform bed. I had little Ms R helping me singing Jem and dancing. She was also a terrific helper with the tools.
Ms R is in love with these new fans, they are AWESOME!! Lasko Pro Performance Blower Fan (series 4900), after doing a LOT of research on fans, we bought 2 of these for the upstairs to try to keep from having to run the window air conditioner. Our room is a converted attic, which never had A/C installed. So far, after a week, they are seriously kicking butt!
Then Thursday we had a special delivery, our new bed! The Sleep Number Crew brought everything in and set it up within minutes. We did a quick run through of the bed and how it works.
And as you can tell the kitties love the bed. Our room is not close to being done. Now I totally want to paint it and still de-clutter some more, along with a few other pieces of furniture. Then it will be perfect! I am so happy that we have gotten this far! I can’t wait to make our room enjoyable, a place to go to get away from the daily hustle and bustle of life.
Hope you all had an amazing week, as amazing as mine!
XOXO – Jesy

To top it off, the staff was amazing. My mom told me that as she walked around all evening, every waiter and bartender would say to her, "Congratulations on the beautiful wedding of your lovely daughter." How sweet is that?
Tomorrow, I'll share photos of the ceremony, I can't wait! xoxo
(Photos of the DTA by Max Wanger)
Beautiful. It is hard to believe it is in Manhattan!!
What a fantastic setting for your wonderful and lovely ceremony - I will be waiting to see the pics. Loved your honeymoon pics too. Thanks for sharing Joanna - you are such a beautiful bride! xxoo Laurie
The waiters did seem very sweet. Congratulations on your wedding. I love the ribbon on your bouquet.
Wow, what a great and interesting location! I am so excited to see more of the photos, Max Wanger is inspiring.

Hi Joanna,
It's so much fun to see these photos. Thanks so much for sharing! What a lovely place for a wedding.
loooooove this venue. very sophisticated. makes me want to get all dressed up and sip brandy, and i don't even drink brandy.
I just fell over sideways out of gleeful dismay. How impossibly delightful that you got to do that THERE. ohmy.
i am loving these photos and so excited to see more. thanks so much for sharing these with us!
Oh, the umbrella and chromatic flowers! And the taxidermy is delightful.
If Mary Poppins and Audrey Hepburn had a love child, it would be that classy umbrella photo at the top.
Great pictures!
that first photo is soo beautiful and sweet... congratulations!
Oh Joanna! Im feeling so nostalgic...its so magical. Im sure I would have tears in my eyes if I were there.

I love, love the first picture with the umbrella! So typical, right?!
Congrats to you both on your wedding day! It looks like it was beautiful day!
It's been great following your exciting journey towards the day (especially since my sister has recently become engaged and we've just started planning!)
Anyway I just wanted to say congrats on a great blog and the wedding!!! Look forward to seeing the next post!
:)

love the umbrella picture. very "singing in the rain"
please frame the first picture. it is magic.
What a truly unique wedding.
the 1st photo is worth a 1000+words...truly warms the ♥!
That first picture is art! That blue umbrella is the perfect touch...and your body language is so happy :)
Its perfect
Not trying to be un-nice, but I don't get the "modern" concept of all the drama--like not seeing the dress, first kiss and all that--when a couple has been living together. Really, I just don't understand it--I guess I am incredibly un-hip. What really floors me is when a bride goes all out in a bouffant pure white dress and a huge church wedding when she has been living with the groom for quite some time. That is really trying to have it all! On the other hand, ANOTHER thing I don't understand is how we girls can get away with wearing a casual-looking unstructured garment, while the men are nattily turned out in tailored suits and all that! It's a bit jarring--doesn't quite go. Oh, I really like that photo with the umbrella, though! The colors are really pretty and it's artsy!
How gorgeous. I love that you have such fond memories of the service that you received there, too: this will be one of the details you (& your guests) remember about the day, I’m sure.
so enjoy (said with a smile in my heart) that first photograph... lovely and sweet.
My husband and I got married at the DTA in 2003 because we wanted to support downtown NYC after September 11 - it is as spectacular as your pictures and we will always remember it so fondly. We got married in the winter, and we had a saxaphonist play jazz so that people could find the place with all the subways snarled from the construction. It is a really special place.
i absolutely love the picture with you two and the umbrella! seriously, classic and beautiful.

OMG so so beautiful.

I have never heard of LemLem but will certainly be a supporter in the future. I'm a bit of an international development/foreign news nerd and a fan of trade over aid so I love the idea behind this company.
I would love to use this bag to haul all my stuff to the office each day (book, giant water bottle and snacks). Plus, it would be such a fun pop of color in my cube while I work.
So lovely!
Their bold colored stripes and simple siloettes make the clothes look gorgeous and effortless. I am loving their ponchos, but wouldn't mind that bag at all. Please count me in!
Great to see social entrepreneurship expanding into fashion/retail!

George was born on May 23, 1867 in Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire, which lies three miles from Tring to the east and four miles from Aylesbury to the west. George was christened at Aylesbury with three of his siblings on February 9, 1868.
George worked as a piecer at the cotton mill in Glossop in 1881 when he was thirteen years old. While still in Glossop, he married Betty Sandiford in 1887. Betty was twenty, George was only nineteen when he married.
George and Betty had moved seven and a half miles north west to the town of Dukinsfield by 1891, where George was working as a labourer in an iron works. It appears that Betty had no children with George and by 1901 they had separated. Betty moved back to her birthplace in Glossop and was found living with her mother; she gave her status as married in both the 1901 and 1911 census returns.
George continued moving west, this time over forty-five miles southwest to Chester, where he was a fried fish dealer in 1896 at 15 Brook Street; nearby, his brother, Amos, was a greengrocer at 47 Brook Street.
By 1900 he had moved again, south seventy miles to Kidderminster, where he had a fried fish business on Blackwell Street.
A year later, George had moved again, to Northfield, Worcestershire and had changed his situation significantly when he appeared in the 1901 census as a thirty-three-year-old general labourer living with a twenty-year-old landlady who was a laundress. Young Sarah Ann Jones had a two-month-old son, named Ernest W Jones. At that time George Crockett was listed as married and Sarah Jones was listed as single, yet they lived as man and wife for over forty years.
Three more children were born before 1905 came to an end, Sarah and all her children used the surname Crockett including Ernest William.
When George accompanied Amos on the voyage to Philadelphia, he gave the address for his next of kin as his wife, Sarah, at Moor Street, Brierly Hill. That was on February 23, 1911. By the time the census was taken on April 2, 1911 another family was living at that residence and I have not been able to find George's family in the 1911 census.
One of the stories that my father told me about George Crockett was that when he and Amos arrived in New York it was the fourth of July and there were American flags everywhere and George remarked that there wasn't a Union Jack to be seen. This has turned out to be family lore because they landed in Philadelphia in March.
On the ship's manifest of the SS Merion, George gave the name of the person he was going to visit as his brother-in-law, Charles Jones. George is described as being 5' 5½” tall with fair complexion, auburn hair, and gray eyes, a true Crockett.
George only stayed in Philadelphia long enough to visit Sarah's brother for a few weeks and then he returned to England on the Lusitania, leaving New York on March 17 and arriving in Liverpool on March 28, 1911. Amos did not return to England with him and I presume he made his way to Alberta overland.
George and Sarah Crockett left England the next year, departing from Bristol on April 3 and arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on April 12, 1912. Thomas Amos Crockett, son of Amos, accompanied them on the voyage. The manifest listed the following aboard the SS Royal Edward:
Crockett, George, 44, Poultry farmer
Crockett, Mrs. G, 32, wife
Crockett, Thomas, 20, Farm labourer
Crockett, Ernest, 11
Crockett, George, 10
Crockett, Ada, 8
Crockett, Mary, 7
On the ship's manifest, both George and Tom Crockett claimed to have worked on a farm in England, but I wonder if that was to get assistance with the passage from the Salvation Army. The family was in “steerage” class with SA noted in the right margin of the manifest. Their destination was given as Edmonton.According to a map in the Busby history book, George's homestead was located on a ¼ section described as South-east quarter, Section 23Township 57 Range 1 West of the 5th Meridian in the Busby Park School District.
From another reference to George and family in the same book about the Busenius family:
My Dad spent his first year of school at Busby Park and recalled George and Sarah's children were: Ernie, Joss, Ada, and Alice. Joss must have been the younger George. George and Sarah moved into Edmonton after leaving the homestead and my Dad recalled that Uncle George worked as an elevator operator and Aunt Sarah worked as a maid at the Queen Alexandra Hospital. In the city directory for 1943, George was listed as retired and Sarah was still working at the hospital.
Amos Crockett's granddaughter, Evelyn, recalls a story about Uncle George John Bull: "There was a dentist's office in the building where John Bull ran the elevator and he offered to make Uncle George a set of false teeth because he had none. A couple of weeks after setting him up with a fine set of dentures, the dentist noticed that George was not wearing his new teeth. When asked the whereabouts of the teeth, John Bull said they were in his pants pocket. To this the dentist replied: I hope they bite you in the ass!"
George passed away in Edmonton in 1944 at age seventy-six and was buried in Edmonton Cemetery on May 13, 1944.
In the city directory for 1947 Sarah was still working at the hospital as a maid and living at #32, 11045-97 Street (Lambton Block). In 1953 she was living at the same address but no occupation was given.
According to my Dad, Aunt Sarah had some sort of mental breakdown and died in a mental facility in Oliver, just north of Edmonton. I wish my Dad was here to ask, because I think I can recall that Sarah also worked at the Oliver hospital.
Sarah died in 1964, twenty years after her husband, she was eighty-four years old. Her body rests beside her husband, George in the Edmonton Cemetery.
When I asked Amos Crockett's granddaughter, Vera Becklake, about her memories of George and Sarah, she had the following to say:
Uncle 'John Bull' was a bit of a rascal. I was surprised to hear that he had been married in England. I know there was some scandal about him and a girl who worked in Grandpa's (Amos) fish and chip shop. Perhaps they were never divorced as I was told that he and Auntie Sarah were never married. I don't recall the circumstances of her death. She worked for years at the Royal Alex Hospital in Edmonton and was badly injured in an elevator accident there but as far as I remember, she recovered enough to go back to work. She was a very sweet and gentle person.
George Crockett and Sarah Ann Jones had the following children:
Ernest William Crockett (1901-1994)
George Crockett (1902-1990)
Ada Millicent Crockett (1904-)
Mary Alice Crockett (1905-)
My name is Betsy Weninger Imholt and I am the great granddaughter of George Crocket (1902-1990). My father is the son of Pearl Georgian Crockett. I just read this posting aloud to my father, Donnie Weninger. I find this information so exciting to read and I so much appreciate your fine writing and great story telling ability. Thank you for sharing this with us.
Betsy, I would love to be in touch with you and your Dad. My email address is on my profile. I have been trying to contact George's descendants for years and heard from Chris and Ron Crockett in Salem and now you, this is indeed exciting!

Generation Y Woefully Unprepared For Job Market, Survey Finds
Everyone knows it's terrible out there for young Americans, aka Generation Y or the millennials, who are just entering the workforce.
While the national unemployment rate has slid below 8 percent the past two months, the official tally for Americans between the ages of 18 to 29 was 12 percent in October. And when you factor in the 1.7 million young adults who are not being counted (as they've taken themselves out of the labor force, presumably after giving up), the actual unemployment rate for the age bracket rate rises to 16.6 percent, according to General Opportunity, a nonprofit youth employment organization.
So what's the cause of the pronounced and prolonged crisis among the members of America's newest generation to enter the workforce? The economy itself? Perhaps that's not the only factor, according to the Student Career Development study conducted by Millennial Branding, a Generation Y research firm, along with StudentAdvisor.com.
The survey reveals a generation composed of students who are "not aggressively preparing for their post-college careers," according to the study. After compiling responses to a questionnaire about employment from over 200 students from across the country, an across-the-board trend of low engagement in career planning was revealed. Only 29 percent of the students have received career and job help from their universities, while only 22 percent belong to a professional development or industry-related group.
More: 10 Millennial Generation Trends For 2012The survey delved into the extent of Gen Y's lack of preparation. Among the findings:
- Less than half have had an internship in college (40 percent), although 85 percent understand that having an internship is vital to launching a career.
- Despite all of Gen Y's social media savvy, only 1 in 3 have a presence on LinkedIn -- the site that recruiters and human resources officers rely on to post jobs and find candidates. In contrast, 95 percent have a Facebook profile.
"College students are missing out on a very valuable resource by not leveraging LinkedIn," says Dean Tsouvalas, editor-in-chief at StudentAdvisor.com. "Internship opportunities, and the ability to network alumni or gain incredible insight into a company, are all there, waiting for students to take advantage."
Any discussion about the troubled job prospects for millennials must of course also make mention of their debt problems. The average student, according to Forbes, already carries $12,700 in credit-card and other kinds of debt. And nationwide, tuition debt just recently passed the $1 trillion mark.
What are the effects of all these struggles? A cultural shift, say observers and commentators. Millennials have been widely noted for their optimism, but according to a recent Rutgers study, just 14 percent of recent college graduates think they'll be able to do better than their parents financially.
"I'm hoping that the millennial generation doesn't set its sights on homeownership as a benchmark of economic stability," sociologist Katherine Newman told Newsweek this summer, "because it's going to be out of reach for so many of them."

Bibliography
About the bibliography
My bibliography database represents years of work by many people. The core of the database was compiled by Milford Wolpoff, with contributions from many students and coauthors. I have added substantially to the database during the last fifteen years, and since I have been blogging all new entries are linked by Digital Object Identifier numbers to their place of publication.
If you find the database useful, please take time to thank the people who worked hard to compile it. I know they will appreciate hearing it.
This database began as a flat text file of bibliographic entries, which I have over the years scripted into a computer-readable format. Many errors have slipped in, including typos from the initial data entry, script fragments from my BibTeX database, and some entries that began in a non-standard format and were scrambled by scripts. Please do not write me expecting that I will fix these errors. It would take me weeks of work to do this. Works will be fixed as I cite them or enter updated information for them.
There are also errors of omission. Most entries are here because they got cited, in Milford's books, in the many research articles by him or his students, or in my work. I mention this mainly because I know that some of you will look up your own names, and find many important papers missing from the database. If you're disappointed in the representation of your articles here, by all means contact me and I will work with you. This database is mirrored on CiteULike and Mendeley and I can import your bibliographic data from these sites, EndNote, BibTeX or other standard formats.
A fuller introduction to the bibliography is in my initial announcement.

Dear Johnnie: Why do so many Longmont neighborhoods have old man-high light posts all along the sidewalk? Was there some construction period when they were popular? Are there any neighborhoods where they are still actively used?
Who pays for the electricity and maintenance? — Curious John
Dear Curious John:Those lights are called pedestal lights. The city has so many — about 9,000 of them — because in the 1960s, the city transitioned from powering porch
A street lamp on the east side of Lonmgont near the 400 block of Alpine Street on Thursday, Oct. 13, 2011. (Joshua Buck/Times-Call)
lights to installing these lights along streets. Their installation continued into the early 1990s.
“They contain the customer service connection point and the electric meter,” Deborah Cameron wrote to Johnnie. Cameron is the customer services and marketing manager for Longmont Power & Communications. “Pedestal installations provided a front-lot underground alternative, and effectively replaced the overhead back-lot service entrances that were installed throughout older portions of Longmont.”
The pedestal lights are owned, maintained and operated by the city, Cameron said.
Hello, Johnnie St. Vrain: I have lived here for more than 50 years. At one time I used to go to Safeway at 17th and Hover and create my own salad from a salad bar they once had. No more.
I want to know where a person can find a good salad bar in Longmont to create their own salad? I know of no such place. Can you help? — Salad Bar Hunt
Hello, Salad Bar Hunt: In answering your question, I risk leaving out a restaurant or store that offers a salad bar. So, if someone out there operates a salad bar that isn’t mentioned in this column, please forgive me.
I don’t know how long ago Safeway had a salad bar, but it was before the time of the person I spoke with over at the Safeway. Regardless, he confirmed that Safeway does not have what would be a considered a “salad bar.” Potato salad. Yes. Olives. Yes. But not leafy greens and croutons, with kidney beans, red onions, baby corncobs and fake-bacon bits.
At least, I think that’s the kind of salad bar you’re talking about.
I asked Johnnie’s Facebook fans what they thought, and several replied: Mad Greens, over on Clover Basin Drive. Another bemoaned the loss of Souper Salad.
S.B., I don’t know what exactly you’re looking for, but you can find salad bars in restaurants that serve other foods, such as pizza places and all-you-can-eat buffets. And, if you’re up for other types of salad, grocery stores still have a wide variety.
Or you could buy a head of green leafy lettuce and all the fixings yourself, then invite a friend over.

So, as of March 30th, every page on Facebook will be rolled over to the new Timeline format currently being used on personal profiles. It’s no use complaining; Facebook has mandated the switchover. While all pages will switch over on the 30th, you can actually get started now on designing it and using the Timeline feature for your page. But for authors, here are some critical tips to make the most of the new format.
1. Choose a great cover photograph. The measurement for the new page cover photo is 851 pixels wide by 315 pixels tall. But be advised: your cover photo must NOT have any of the following:.”
Any of that stuff is expressly forbidden by Facebook.
That said, your cover photo can really make a great impression. It should be sharp, illustrate who you are as an author (and more if you happen to have a good platform) and include a nice eye-catching graphic. Here’s the cover photo I had my graphic design guru do up for my page:
Since my platform is “writer, producer, ninja” it was important to me that I convey each of those items through a visual cue. So, you have a screenshot of The Fixer website, me doing some ninjutsu, and then book covers for my various recent works. My logo is front and center and my name is prominently displayed. I think it works very well and comments have been great. Having the cover photo with Timeline gives you far more real estate to make an impression than the old page layout, so be sure to use it to get people excited about your writing! The overall design also ties in with my website design – brand continuity is very important!
Finally, your cover image is also clickable, so be sure to put up a description there that helps sell yourself and your work. My cover photo description reads: “Find out more about my books here (for Kindle users) and (for Nook users) and be sure to visit me at & on Twitter @jonfmerz” It’s one more opportunity to engage new and old fans alike so don’t forget to use it!
2. There’s no longer a tab you can set as your default landing page, so anyone coming to your page will see the Timeline feature. Make sure if you’ve got posts or comments in your timeline that you don’t like that you delete them and clean things up.
3. FBML is going away in June. For a while now, FBML (Facebook Mark-Up Language) was a simple application you could add to your page and create a sort-of custom website on it, using HTML etc. Well, Facebook has decided that FBML is obsolete and they’re switching everything over to iFrames now. What that means is if you have any custom tabs (say, “Subscribe to My Newsletter” or something like that) they will stop working in June. So the best thing to do now is to replicate those same tabs using iFrames. How do you do that? Pretty easily, actually: grab the Static HTML iFrames Tab Application and add it to your page. Now you can take whatever HTML coding you had on your FBML tab and move it over to the iFrames tab. After previewing the new iFrames tab and making sure it works like it should, you can delete the old FBML tab.
One thing, FBML used the same CSS style sheets that Facebook uses and inherited all those font qualities, etc. The new iFrames tab does not, so your stuff is going to look different until you set the font size and face to the same as your other pages. You can set the CSS style directly on the iFrame app tab when you insert the rest of the old FBML code. iFrames actually gives you a LOT more creative control over what you want the tab to do, so take some time to learn how to maximize it. I’m not going to run through how to do that here, but it’s something you’ll want to explore to get the most functionality out of your new page design. (I’m still in the process of redesigning my page anyway, so it would be premature of me to offer up advice when I’m still figuring it all out!)
4. Hello Data! One of the coolest new features when you implement the Timeline design on your page is the incredible amount of information Facebook gives to page administrators about who is viewing your page, liking it, post popularity, etc. This is fantastic because it lets you see immediately how much your posts and engagement with readers is registering. Say you write a post about your recent book coming out for sale: with the new data feedback, you can see how popular it actually was. It takes a certain degree of guesswork out of trying to quantify your reader engagement. The results are right in front of you. It might be slightly disconcerting to learn that your throwaway joke about Snooki and the Mayan calendar had more viral impact than talking up your latest thriller, but it’s also good to know how your demographic responds to you.
Here’s a screenshot of my admin panel that displays on top of my cover photo (you have the option to hide this – see the upper right button there?) Check out the small square that says “insights.” If you click on “see all” you’ll be whisked away to a page with incredible detail. But here’s the cool thing about even that small screenshot: I’ve been sick lately two times. Guess where those two dips in my engagement data fell? Exactly when I was feeling like crap and didn’t post very much or otherwise engage. As a result, my reach dipped, people weren’t talking about me, and the page just sort of died in terms of excitement.
Why is this data so important? Because as much as you might like to lock yourself away and live out that “writer hermit” fantasy, the truth is you’re in business. You sell ebooks, or books, or both. And as such, you need to know what your audience is doing, how they’re responding, and how to engage them – that is, if you have any hope of making a long-term career out of this stuff. So Facebook has graciously given you oodles of information to help you improve your business. Seriously. Some of you will no doubt roll your eyes and employ that old excuse, “I don’t have TIME to look at all of this stuff, I’m a writer.” Great. Well, if that’s your excuse, then so be it. Some other writer will quickly grasp how this data can give them a leg up on you and then proceed to decimate you in sales. This kind of intelligence is gold, people. Use it or lose it.
I’ll have another post next week discussing more ways to make your page better. But for now, get out there and start creating some kick-ass designs!
And by the way, if you find this post useful, come swing by my Fan Page and say hello!

BALMAIN.
If you missed the first part of the Fashion, A-Z exhibit at Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) that ended May 8th, have no fear! The second exhibit is up and running until November 10th where more than 60 garments and accessories from FIT’s permanent collection will be on display for the public to view.
If.
Worn by Anja Rubik in Balmain’s Fall 2012 campaign, this jacket stole our hearts in March and we’ve been lusting after it ever since. Silk fringes of gold, white, and navy scattered with embellishment of Swarovski crystals and mirrors create this show stopping striped blazer. Our only opposition is the $31,095 price tag! However, we just can not let this look go, so we have found a way to get it for less.
The look revolves around the jacket, and we love this sequin and silk piece by Parker . Channel the stripes and embellishment with rows of sparkling, two-toned sequins and keep the structure with an exaggerated shoulder. Grab a simple, comfy, white tee shirt like this one by T by Alexander Wang . It's sheer, cool, and layers perfectly with a statement jacket. Next, add a pair tailored skinny pants. Nez trousers by Hakaan boast a perfect fit, with a flattering front pleat and comfortable low rise..!
Now that Fashion Week is quickly closing in on us it's time to start finding some answers to that all too important question, "What should I wear?" Granted Fashion Week is a perfect excuse to find some new gear, but unless you are an heiress with money to burn or happen to be bff's with a major fashion publicist who will let you borrow the latest and greatest Balmain ensemble, you will have to plan your outfits according to your budget. And with so many parties to attend, it can be hard not to go overboard and not dip into the rent money. Now, I find that whenever this time of year rolls around and I need a few pieces to update my wardrobe without incurring any over draft fees is to hit the all too lovable madhouse that is Forever 21. It is a one stop shop for fun Fashion Week friendly pieces that will not leave you dead broke and eating tuna and crackers for the rest of the month. Here are a few of my picks that will give your closet just a little boost without breaking the bank.
Guy or girl, studded shoes are just in. You can go from something as simple as a pair of studded flats our outrageous with a pair of super duper high heels. Gotta make the guys drool some how right?.

Table of Contents - 1998 - Volume 25, Issue 03 (Special Issue: Civil Society in Britain)
a1 Dept of Economic and Social History, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, EH8 9JY
ABSTRACT
The concept of civil society provides a useful means of evaluating the social and political relationships of British towns. Civil society refers to the non-prescriptive relationships that lie between the state and kin. Such relationships are associated with the existence of the free market, the rule of law and a strong voluntary associational culture. Both theoretical analysis and historical evidence link civil society with the nature of urban places, their complexity, their function as a central place and their operation as a focus for flows of information. Between 1780 and 1820 the agencies of civil society in Britain provided an arena for making choices, for reasoned informed debate and for the collective provision and consumption of services in an open and pluralist manner.

International conflict has been accounted for in many different ways—in terms of aggressive “instincts,” territoriality, population growth, the search for basic resources or seaports, the protection of trade routes, psychopathological deviations, plunder and profit, a drive for imperialist control, and so forth. Some theorists have considered grievances, competition, anxieties, tension, threat, and provocation to be of special importance. Others have laid heavy emphasis upon national power or capability, military preparedness, strategic considerations, and the competition for dominance.1 No doubt most if not all of these variables are relevant, but this recognition does not help much in the development of a theory of war, its dynamics, and contributing causal networks. In the long run all factors need to be pulled together in some systematic way. A serious difficulty emerges from the fact that the various “causes” that contribute to war tend to be highly interactive, that is, they affect each other in various ways and often in many different directions. The problem is to find out, if possible, which variables are contributing most to international violence and in what proportion. The purpose of this paper is to take an early step in this direction by reporting on some empirical research currently under way and by presenting some tentative findings which suggest partial explanations and some implications and difficulties for national policies.
Nazli Choucri, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the author and co-author of numerous articles on the analysis and forecasting of international conflict behavior.
Robert C. North, Professor of Political Science and Director of Studies in International Conflict and Integration in the Institute of Political Studies, Stanford University, is the author of Moscow and Chinese Communists and other books and articles concerned with international relations, international conflict, crises, and the antecedents of war.

As we prepared for this journey we had read about many different country’s orphanages (baby houses as they call them here in Kazakhstan) and what we read described a very clean but rather plain place with little stimulation. Our experience with Astana’s baby house is very different from what we expected. They are very clean, but they are more like a big home with pictures on the walls, many colorful toys throughout, friendly people that truly care for the children, and a schedule full of activities such as music and organized playing. The only similarity to what we read is the ratio of care givers to children (typically about 1 care giver to about 12 toddlers), which does limit how much they can interact with each child independently. Typically these children are 1 month delayed for every three months in an orphanage, which is about what we have seen with our new son, especially communication. To our surprise he is much closer to his age with fine motor, gross motor, and self- help skills. Here are several pictures of the Astana Baby House…
As you can see our son’s temporary home is not what most people think of when they hear the term orphanages. Although his new home with us will be much better in many ways, I am sure he will still miss his familiar surroundings at first. We are close to sharing more about our new little man, but for now we will tease you a little by just give you a sneak peak…
Thank you for all your comments yesterday, we really appreciate you following along with us on this journey!
Blessings,
Jay & Jen

Ok...enough teasing already!!!! We want to see the little guy!
His toes are adorable and he looks just like Hayden from the backside when he was a baby.
The baby house looks very nice and homey like you said. It is nice to see that it is so clean and he seems to be well taken care of.
Looking forward to seeing the rest of your new son...we will keep you all in our prayers as well as Shelby, Hayden and Zoe.
Toni
Ok you two, enough!!! I want to see him!!!
Sounds like everything is going well. We will pray things continue to go smoothly.
"The joy of the LORD is your strength." Nehemiah 8:10
Love ya!
How very cool - I am so excited for both of you. My prayers are with you and all FOUR of your children! :-)
Much love from Michigan, Kristy

How sweet he looks. Even his toes. I like the little hat. The house is suprising. It does look very stimulating. I was suprised to see the ball area where the kids could jump and play in. It's rather modern. I am continuing to pray for all of you.
He looks like such a doll -- from behind! Can't wait to see his darling face and meet him later. Many blessings! Jess :-)
Hi, it's Mackenzie,
Sorry I didn't get to say good-bye. He looks cute from behind, just like my Mom said, he looks like Hayden did at that age.
See ya soon, Mackenzie
Great stuff! Thanks for sharing the teaser pics. He looks great! I will pray for continued blessings as your journey moves along.
--Hugh
Looks like a stimulating learning environment for little kids! Of course, your home will be a much better place for this little guy. Looks like a cutie from behind - can't wait to see his little face and all his cute features!
Oh how it brings back memories. Your apartment is very much like ours was in Moscow. The double door, the bedroom,bath kitchen all the same. Amazing! We are so happy for you and we know what your are feeling. What a wonderful journey. The baby house looks very good and similar to our orphanage. Do you have to spend a month there? That is very different from what we did but regions require different things. Good luck and sorry i did not answer I had no idea who invited us to the blog. You didn't tell me you were close to going so I did not know. I am a big chicken on the computer so inless I know I don't answer. Anyways, we are praying for your safe journey and keep us posted. Love, M.J.
Hi Jay & Jen,
I hope you are feeling alot of joy right now. He looks like he will be handful as every boy should be and team him up with Zoe and you will have nuclear fusion. The teaser pictures are great and the enviroment looks much better than I would have perceived. What an amazing experience for the both of you and the kids. Can't wait to see him.
The Straw Clan is in my prayers.
Timmy
What great pictures. Thanks for sharing them with us. Ingrid asked why you are not showing the litte guy's face?? Bruce said, "Because you guys are just
goofy". We are praying that HIS wisdom, protection and PEACE be upon you both. The Blalocks
Hey, Everyone here is waiting, well not so patiently, but we'll survive until you get everything settled. It looks like the lord has guided you to the right place at the right time to get the final piece to your family. Please know your in our prayers always. Can't wait to meet my nephew. LOL
Sue

Looking forward to lighting up Sabathia tonight! Lets make it 2/3 instead of 2 2/3!
Oh, and...
Fuck the Yankees!
Iam personally glad we don't see the Sox again until August....as a Yankees fan, I don't know why we can't beat them, but I hope that by the time Aug rolls around, A.J. learns how to pitch under pressure, and Wang is long gone. Nevertheless....we'll see what happens tonight....
man i have a good feeling about tonight!!!!
but seriously. imagine the sox with teixera.
OUCH!
That's certainly something the Yankees have going for them, B.R. - a long vacation from the Red Sox. There are a lot of games between now and then. They'll walk in cocky say oh we're a new team now, we're a well-oiled machine and we're clicking on all cylinders. But then Josh Beckett or Jon Lester will be standing out on the mound. Strike one. One-two-three first inning. 30 pitches from A.J. Burnett in the bottom of the 1st, and the Yankees will be thinking, "Here we go again."
What would the Yankee fans rather see after 60 games? Assuming the Red Sox beat them again tonight.
Being 0-8 against Boston, 2 GB in the East?
Or being 2-3 against Boston, 6.5 GB in the East?
Your second choice was reality after 60 games in 2008.
Say we're able to sweep the Yankees (not likely given the pitching matchup tonight). If I were a Yankee fan like B.R., I would try not to read too much into it. The Yanks have had a lot of good things going on in a lot of different categories (I just read Heyman saying the whole starting infield lineup has only 8 errors). Two games out of first place, with the kind of hitting and defense they've been doing? Jeter and Damon doing well when they could have fallen off so badly? Not a bad situation.
It's fun as a Sox fan to be beating the Yankees regularly this season, but there's no psychological factor going on on the field that's making it so. We just have happened to be able to win 'em all.
The NY tabloids have been fun, though.
Zen, you are so sensible. If the Yankees had been beating us rather than the other way around, I'd hate it, but I wouldn't read much into it, either.
However, I sure as hell wouldn't hang around a Yankees blog subjecting myself to schadenfreude!
"Your second choice was reality after 60 games in 2008."
:>)
Damn that was fun!
Thanks, Laura.
Come to think of it, Ish made the point a lot better than I did.
(I just read Heyman saying the whole starting infield lineup has only 8 errors)
You can't make an error on a ball you can't get to.
(Note: No idea how NY is doing according to better fielding metrics.)
(not likely given the pitching matchup tonight).
That's bullshit, man! It's fuckin' CC. His ability to spit the bit against us is Garzian.
Zen, you are so sensible. If the Yankees had been beating us rather than the other way around, I'd hate it, but I wouldn't read much into it, either.
That five game sweep in 2006 was soul crushing. The standings in June don't mean as much as the standings in August, but....
I'm trying not to gloat, here, man!
If it was September I'd probably be rubbing the front of my jeans while reading the Schadenfreude posts.
Fuck the Yankees!

That five game sweep in 2006 was soul crushing. The standings in June don't mean as much as the standings in August, but....
When you begin at 2 games out and end up at 6.5, that's what's crushing. It sucked that it was the Yankees that did it, but that was just the icing on the cake.
Also, that was five games in four days. This year, Yanks started slow (what's new), lost two to us. Started doing better, lost three to us. Now kicking ass, lost two more to us.
Now let's make it one more, CC or no!
So if Penny has a good outing tonight... will he be on the trade block tomorrow? Both Smoltz and Bucholz are knockin at the door.
At least when the Red Sox are winning it makes the dreary weather tolerable. I don't think we've seen the sun in Beantown all week.
FUCK - looks like YES
Evening all...
L is getting sox radio on her laptop.
evening, lord.
john flaherty looks like a fucking idiot.
Smoltz's start postponed, will he make one tomorrow? Don't know, but this is possibly the last game that Penny starts for the Sox this year, let us hope it is a good start that amps his trade value to the stratosphere.
MFY's need to go down.
1) dinner
check
2) It is Rum and Cokes tonight as this teetotaler goes for three in a row!!!
Frag the Yankees
Morning Lord - sit back and enjoy!!!
Hey look it's Lord and Mouse again...
Again,on for one innings or so tonight.
At least all the other MFY series this season are at weekends.
Hi everyone. Wmtc4 minus 1 and counting. Trees are trimmed, house is cleaned. Red Sox are kicking Yankee butt.
And an upcoming L-day.
So much for the no hitter...
About fragging time a MFY got hit this year.
hbp - yay
I know it is stating the bleeding obvious, but the first four in this line-up are truly hateful specimens.
Carry on.
Umps conferring.
Oooooooooh warnings. Shakin' in me boots!
'Bout time the Sox hit a Yankee after all the plunking they've done against us this year!
weren't the hbp numbers just the opposite back in 2004? all the sox were getting hit?
A dot on the cards. Pity JTC doesn't bat...
Maybe Penny is trying to endear himself to his teammates before he goes on the auction block?
"And an upcoming L-day."
Thank you!
Don: "Bluff to third, bluff to first. Doesn't throw to either venue."
Drink!
I'd complain Penny isn't wasting a pitch, but it isn't his fault Cano's swinging at pitches at his eyebrows.
Since 2004 to Tonight - Red Sox batters hit 54 Times, MFY's - 61
thanks penny
25 pitches.
11 pitches....and then you waste my time.
Sit Crusoe.
Whew 25 pitch first inning and 17 minutes to get 3 out... typical Sox Yankees game. I'll need to shave before this game ends.
FY - crap, I truped myself there on that, I thought for sure it would at least scrape the wall.
Damn... Castiglione pulled a Trupiano on us--There's a drive high and deep to left!!!... Damon has the room and hauls it in for the out.
ON FIRE!
dj werd
Drewble!
Fire!
yoooooooook
I forgot about "drewble". Fusionmouse knows more JOSisms than me.
Somebody give CC a donut
any news on cc's ultrasound?
Puppies were spotted
night all.
Time to refill the glasss
Meh, disappointing inning.
Night Lord... sleep well across the pond; the game will probably still be on when you wake up. 1/2 hour per inning at this rate!
CC's ultrasound?
They found a dong.
K or popup please.
probably shouldn't rag on cc -- i hear penny is due right around jos1
Bleh.
Okay, that was neither a K nor a pop-up.
Double play? Triple play? K? Pop-up? Lineout? Any of these would be great right about now.
Ok, Penny is not making me very happy rihgt now
Sit.
Sin Milk dud, oh, yeah, start arguing you toad.
That K was huge.
Now just get a DP to escape this.
Copper-K; still, I'll go out on a limb and say we're gonna see "Moose" tonight.
Not enamoured of the call! (DRINK!)
the dud abides -- K!
DP!!
HAHA
Eck, on Penny's size: The ball looks so small in his hand.
BAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
Don: Swisher falls asleep at the switch!
DP BABY!!!
Oh yeah, Swishaliciuos you are now my favorite yankee!!!
mog -- swisher is such an idiot.
penny yelling "second base second base"
Swisher demonstrating awesome baseball skills all over this series... I may have to send him flowers!
NICE
Another good Swisher move.
PAPI!!!!!
PAPI!
Papi!!!
Yeah Baby!!!
Curtain call time!
Methinks we are starting to see the REAL Papi!
LARGE FATHER DONG!!!!!!!!!!
fuck you fatty
PAPI induces labor on CC and steals the baby!
PAPI!!!!!
TAKE THAT CC YOU'VE BEEN LARGE FATHERED!!!!
Puppies, ish, they are puppies.
Once again we take an early lead. Love it.
Ish, great call :)
Did you see Francona grinning in the dugout? Nice.
That dong looked like the 2004 ALDS winner off of... Washburn was it?
But we love puppies!
Was the Ortiz homer first pitch? I'm on GameChannel...
yes, first pitch
but we love puppies
That is why they must be stolen from a MFY.
Heidi looks dressed for winter. WHEN WILL SUMMER COME?
Any of you with Time Warner Cable would know that satellite hates puppies.
cc distracted by the dunkin' ad behind the plate?
Ah, now I get it.
Papi has arrived at the Mendoza line... please continue upward!!
CC and Penny together use a lot of uniform material.
Not for sure when summer will come but will be hoping that we get good weather for lake fun the next two weeks.
True, Penny is also a large man.
You going up to---is it called the cottages or something? I remember you went there one summer. Somewhere north of Toronto?
We have a houseguest here, but she's been awake since 3 a.m. and has gone up to bed. I'm glad b/c she's not a big fan and was distracting me.
Oops, wrong person. What lake, S1C?
Cottages north of Toronto is a Cdn thing. You probably heard Tim talking about it. I think s1c stays in Mass. No?
Don't let her read the game thread, Laura!
Yeah, I somehow read the comment as coming from Redsock, not S1C. Read too fast.
Lake Bungee - in Woodstock Valley CT.
Late start this year in opening it up (both families having major job changes), so this weekend its put out the docks, clean out the cobwebs and assorted other things.
Then next week we start the fathers day bbq's, the end of school bbq's and then the graduation celebration blow outs.
"Don't let her read the game thread, Laura!"
I know, I thought of that! Hm, any chance she'll find this?? :)
"Yeah, I somehow read the comment as coming from Redsock, not S1C. Read too fast."
I wish we were off to a cottage, why not. But I think that will never be part of our future. I'll always want to use the money for travel.
I don't look forward to Penny taking swings. Hopefully he will be traded before that.
s1c, I am still hoping you change your mind on JoS. Not just me, we're all hoping.
Sit
I don't look forward to Penny taking swings. Hopefully he will be traded before that.
We'll catch up with him in Philadelphia.
Do you think pitchers wake themselves up making pitches in their sleep?
K! Love watching Damon K.
S1C, sounds good. Is it a place you get to each weekend? We leave for the Cape tomorrow and will be living in our cottage until mid-August while our new place is under construction. I can't wait! Two cats, a dog, two adults, two computers, a printer, scanner, and other stuff---all in 500 square feet.
"I don't look forward to Penny taking swings. Hopefully he will be traded before that."
Would he be so much worse than any of other pitchers?
I second Laura's comment about JOS1, S1C!
L-girl its a matter of 2 furlough days taking a bite out of the pay check plus having to come up with additional money to get the Mom mobile back on the road, plus going from a short commute to a large commute, in other words the financial picture went from safe to fragging kidding me in a matter of days.
Evening, all. Watching the game here on a tiny streaming window- but still, watching!
SIT! Even better than a Damon K is an ARod K.
Best three-inning 65-pitch performance.
Sit!
Where in the world are you, Ofer?
(Sort of like Carmen Sandiego)
Would he be so much worse than any of other pitchers?
Shades of Colon.
That sounds tough, S1C. I am sorry to hear that. This economy is awful. Every day we hear about someone else who has either lost a job or suffered some way financially.
s1c, I do understand. I don't mean to pressure you.
I just wonder if in the long run you would notice the difference in $$, but you and B'fly would have so much fun that it would be worth it.
But hey, I'm the Queen of Rationalization. There's nothing I can't rationalize when I want to.
San Francisco, now. Here for a couple more days, then NY for a week, then back to Israel.
"Would he be so much worse than any of other pitchers?"
There's no possible way he'd be worse than Colon last year.
"Where in the world are you, Ofer?
(Sort of like Carmen Sandiego)"
I thought of that. Or Find Waldo.
I live by that financial advice, Laura. Not the best savings plan, but a lot more fun.
Allan just said: there's no telling when JOS2 will be. It's true.
Amy - the lake house is part of BH's family and gets used by everybody (10 MFY fans, 10 Sox fans) and this year do to major job changes in 3 of the 5 families is basically where everyone will be escaping from the rat races (good thing we all like each other).
Plus this year the Virginia family is coming after the 4th and not leaving until mid august so, now is the time to really enjoy only the 7 of us who do most of the work around there.
Yeah, Waldo came to mind also, though I don't see Ofer dressing like Waldo.
This is my first time actually hearing Eck.
How many FYs would it take to fill a CC?
Wow, 10 Sox fans and 10 Yankee fans.
I hope you are all as civilized as Harvey and I are while watching games. That is, no talking, no cheering, just watching. :)
4.8
"San Francisco, now. Here for a couple more days, then NY for a week,"
My two favourite places in the US. Enjoy.
If you need or want tips on fun cheap NYC things to do, email me.
Why isn't Allan in thread?
Good places to be, Ofer, all of them.
Yeah, Waldo came to mind also, though I don't see Ofer dressing like Waldo.
Hey, at least the red and white would be supporting my team...
First time hearing Eck---lucky you. Just don't go back to Israel speaking English like he does.
I suppose he was before, but my attention span's short tonight.
i'm here!
I hope you are all as civilized as Harvey and I are while watching games. That is, no talking, no cheering, just watching. :)
Not a chance, we are always ragging on each other (but we never get angry). The funny thing is it is split down the line generationally with each generation having the same number!!!
damn - foul did not crack kay's skull open
Amy, same here, I try to live for today, although I know it's not always wise.
I wish someone would just tell me right now if I'm going to live long enough to use what little savings we have. 'Cause if not, I want to spend it all on travel.
Well, as long as no one gets nasty. You all must be more mature than Harvey and I are. Only the vow of silence seems to work.
My favorite expression regarding money is: You can't take it with you.
Isn't it a little early to talk about CC's 300th win?
"The funny thing is it is split down the line generationally with each generation having the same number!!!"
Too funny.
So it's a definite no??? Jos1 I mean.
Where does your heart yearn to be, l-girl? Travel-wise....
At least you have savings. We spend it before we can save it. And then we borrow. But we always call it "responsible borrowing." When we sold our house recently and had so little equity in it, we rationalized that we had used that equity to send two kids to college and to pay for a wedding, etc.
My favorite expression regarding money is: You can't take it with you.
Mine: money, so they say, is the root of all evil today.
Patrick, you're right, but it's probably a little harder to take that view if you have kids and a mortgage.
Eck: uh oh.
Never mind, not Eck.
Amy, you're telling me you have no savings, no pension? That's hard to believe. You owned a home that you sold, so you had equity from that. We will never own a home, and we have no pension except our own savings.
Jim Nantz in the booth with Don and Eck. Hello, Friend.
Maybe they can show the action on the field. That would be nice.
Mine: money, so they say, is the root of all evil today.
I have related-demos, but thought they might be too old farty.
Yeah, its a definite no, (BH and I) have been spending days going over everything but with the college fund losing a good portion of money, the 500 here and 500 there for this n that for Marist along with all the crap that came down in the last two weeks it is literally hold everything until September for extra money.
Why do you think I have been emptying the liquor cabinet?
Sit
JohnGF, I am a travel nut. The list of places I want to go is very long. I've traveled as much as I can, but as I get older and I feel time moving so quickly, it feels urgent.
I don't have enough time and money to do the travel I want... but I'm working on that. Changing my life to get more of both.
Why do you think I have been emptying the liquor cabinet?
~$18/5gal.
We have a 401K or whatever, but no pension. We only have that because our employer contributes partially to it and the rest comes directly from our paychecks. It's a good thing.
So yeah, I guess those are savings, but since I never have to take the money and put it away, I can't be tempted to spend it. If it were in my hands, it would somehow not get put it into savings.
As for the house, see above. We had only a small amount of equity when we sold it.
OK s1c, I will let it go. Good luck with everything.
I keep wondering if there are other threaders who we neglected to invite.
I have related-demos, but thought they might be too old farty.
Well, my perception is that Pink Floyd are still doing quite well with 20+ people. There's plenty of 90's music I'd consider more "old farty" than them. But then again, about half my music is from the 70s, so maybe I'm not objective...
Ah, S1C, that answers my question from last night (not sure you saw it). I was concerned about why two games in a row you said you were emptying the liquor cabinet.
Hang in there. I do believe things will eventually get better. Have you called Marist about the change in your job circumstances? Colleges can be pretty good about those things, though these days even they are pinched.
Hey Mikey!
DO doesn't want to interrupt Nantz to say the inning ended.
The borrowing issue is one of the reasons I took so long to go to school. My parents told us when we were in high school that um, yeah. We don't have any money saved for you to go to college.
I never really entertained the thought of taking out massive student loans but it's taken until now to realize how I just have to grin and bear it. I still want to continue to live a life that is low on borrowing.
"We have a 401K"
That's all I meant. That's all we have, the Cdn equivalent of IRA. We do the automatic savings thing too.
We don't have a lot, but we don't make a lot, either.
Thanks for the good wishes, but it will work out, just pisses me off that after all this time I get treated like crap and have to make major changes to how I approach my job on such short notice.
now you need $ to restock the cabinet ...
All the travel I want to do optimally needs me to be younger than I am: hiking and riding horses take it out of me more and more. Still keeping in the game, but not sure how long I can.
Ish, student loans are not a bad deal when it comes to borrowing. And you have lots of time to pay them off very slowly.
Damn... how did we let a MFY pitcher last more than 2 2/3 innings!
Red Sock - trust me, I won't have to buy liquor if I get drunk every night for a month. #1 gift recieved for years in this family has been liquor, I empty one cabinet and just go to the basement and bring up another case or bottle.
Ish, almost everyone takes out loans for school. It's pretty much impossible to do otherwise.
You're investing in your future. I have a young lawyer friend who says "I took out a mortgage on my brain".
She does nonprofit public interest law, so she says it's the only mortgage she'll ever have.
John, is that you and your dog in your avatar?
Amy, it's just wrapping my head around it. But I'm diving into it... That's also a big reason I'm going two years at community college and then transfering elsewhere.
I love this time of year. Outside, the gloam is still crepuscular.
"just pisses me off that after all this time I get treated like crap and have to make major changes to how I approach my job on such short notice."
Yup. I hear ya. Careful, you'll turn into a socialist.
JUST KIDDING S1C
One of my five (5!) dogs, Amy, yes. When he was a puppy. And I was younger too.
YES stat

HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHA
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHA
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHA

Ish--gotta love the Maine Community College System! Take it from me up at EMCC.
More and more people are doing that, Ish. Community colleges are a great deal, and you can finish up almost anywhere.
Our undergraduate school has a fair number of students who start at community colleges for that reason---they save money and still get a degree from a four year school.
Plus you can skip those damn standardized tests!
"All the travel I want to do optimally needs me to be younger"
We have one wish-list trip like that, dog-sledding. Now we even have a friend in the Yukon we can visit and learn with. I fear if we don't go soon we never will.
THANKS JOHNNY!!!! YOU SURE SUCK!!!!
This is great!
DAMON!! HHAHAH!
Yup. I hear ya. Careful, you'll turn into a socialist.
LOL - of course what really pisses me off, if my boss was six weeks older, I probably wouldn't have to make any changes plus would be getting a raise, but no he's six weeks shy of taking the early retirement.
Five dogs?! Yay!

Starting tonight, the Red Sox will play 20 of their next 23 games (in 24 days) against teams that figure to be playoff contenders this season. ...There is probably some middle ground between those two choices, but there's little arguing with the fact that this is a very important month.
May 3- 6 Angels May 7- 9 Yankees May 10-12 Blue Jays May 14-16 at Tigers May 17-18 at Yankees May 19-20 Twins May 21-23 at Philadelphia May 24-26 at Tampa BayCome May 27, the season will be 30 percent over and the Sox will know whether they are contenders or frauds.
Is it too early to give up on the 2010 Red Sox? NO!, say 54.1% voters in this Globe poll.

Hi! Been lurking here for about a year but I've always had problems logging in to comment.
Anyway, I just got tickets to Wednesday's game. It'll be my first Red Sox game to attend. Decided to splurge a little bit in celebration of end-of-exams.
Any tips for the first-timer? I picked Wednesday because the weather looks to be good, and I think the match-up will be Lackey vs his old team. Should be interesting.
My only tip is savour every moment. Your first time at Fenway is very special. Enjoy!
And welcome to the thread.
Why am I just not excited about watching this game? OK, our "ace" is pitching, so I should feel better. But alas....
Meanwhile, we are going to the game on Saturday against the NYY. Our annual game with my brother and his Yankee fanatic friend Adine. I may need xanax for that game.
FY!
Hi, Matt....there is almost nothing you need to do to enjoy Fenway. It's just the best place on earth to watch baseball. Even my Yankee fan friends say it's true. Enjoy the game!
FY flinched a bit at that flying bat.
FY X 2!
this new thing on espn where they have little lights for balls, strikes and outs really sucks. can't tell how many are lit.
...
OH FUCKING FY PCIK!!!!!
Fenway has always been my favourite park. Even... you know when. The first time I was there I just could not get over how beautiful it was. I had seen it on TV so many times but it was like I had never seen it before.
DEFENSE!!!
now for some offense.
So I just was using the Google translate tool and translated this page into French (and back to English). It's pretty funny to read our comments translated into French. Unfortunately, my French is sort of junior high level vocabulary, but still amusing. Our comments seem so much more erudite in French!
Everything sounds better in French.
Please be ok Double-H
Matt,
Enjoy your trip to Fenway. It is amazing. I was awestruck when we first walked in. I felt a lot like Rudy's dad..."This is the most beautiful sight these eyes have ever seen." Beyond that, the atmosphere is unbelievable. There is a sea of fans and it is impressive.
Take the tour.
did joe just say "clog the bases"?
beltrE
Turnout will be light here tonight, I think, between the sucking Sox and the charging Bruins.
E-drian
Phew. RSVP.
OK, now I cannot turn off the damn translater. Every time I switch a web page or refresh, I get a toolbar at the top asking if I want to translate. Arrggh. That's what I get for playing around with things.

Oh yes, speaking of French, RSVP.
Amy, did you try right-clicking on the toolbar?
SWEATY!!!
SWEAT POWERED
YOUK!! We score first!!
I think I fixed it. Don't ask how, but it went away. For now. Maybe it was when I cursed at it in French.
I love French cursing.

LET'S MAKE A DONG!!!!!!!
Hall-lelujah!
My eyes are burning! We have two home runs and are ahead by three runs! And we are playing the ANGELS!
Whoa, we got a three-run lead here now.
Loooong inning for Saunders.
Youk is NOT happy about that.
yeah, yook very chatty on the way to first!
Doctor Doubles does it once more!
the doctor is in -- and on second base.
Whoo-hoo! Dr Doubles this time!
Do my eyes deceive me? 5-0??
Not quite dead yet.
Were you referring to Lowell or the team, Benjamin?
Both work, really.
YEAH! Nice.
CS!
Always easier when you cut Martinez out of the play.
Not Dead Yet?
More like.
Drew thinks he'll go for a walk.
I knew someone would post that. :)
Ozzie never ceases to amuse:
Swisher hit a go-ahead two-run home run in the sixth -- leaving his arm up longer than the State of Liberty -- Chicago rallied to win. And as far as Swisher's celebration, Guillen said that's just the kind of person Swisher is.
"That's the way he is. Good for him, enjoy it," Guillen said. "I wish he could do that for me, because he wasn't a very good player for me. He was very bad for me."

Bottled water companies telling us how their bottles are recyclable and you can make shirts out of them = very fucked up.
Evening folks...good to see some runs on the board.
Get him out!
Out of the inning...
Alright! Still rolling.
mdc up
Wow! Caught stealing.
Wow, another runner thrown out at second!
Not ANOTHER CS??
Nice work, HH. Let's see if the bullpen can avoid imploding for a change.
victor got his shit figured out! even with the one hop throw, fy was waiting with the tag.
Back after a 3-2 Bruins win.
We've had several good bullpen appearances lately.
...although it seems like whenever our bullpen does well, Amy is not around. Convenient. ;)
yoooooooooook
mr. rbi!
I am here, just checking in and out. I would love to see our bullpen do well!
Go Drew GO!
lowell into 3rd??
wearing a jet pack???
nice.
Wow Sciocia really left this pitcher out to dry.
drew runs thru stop sign (thinking, fuck that coach, he's a blind fool...)
I just threaded on the wrong blog! :)
BELTRE BELTS ONE! Whoo-hoo!
Now we don't even need the bullpen to be good, just decent.
YES ---
14-4!!!!!!!!!
FUCK YEAH TIMES 3!!!
Save a few runs for tomorrow, boys.
MOAR PLZ
Nice to see some offense! Maybe being swept by Baltimore will be the turning point for the season, when everyone on the team said: It's ON.
I thought sweeping Toronto was a turning point. But this will do!
Wow. What a score. &, to think, when I wore my Papelbon jersey to the university library today, a couple students wearing Yankee caps laughed at me.
The Angels are getting KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT, we're up by 10!
EN FUEGO. He is El Hombre tonight!
ob's harsh words have clearly lit a fire under drew.
good ol' shemp!!!!!!!!
Dr Doubles strikes again!
Save some runs for tomorrow night!
Wouldn't that triple by Lowell have been an ITPHR for a lot of other people on the team?
i think it was a double and he took third on the throw home to try and get drew
Obie thinks the RS should slack off! Too many hits and runs!
GODDAMN IT:
MAKE TITO APOLOGIZE!!!!!!!!!!
I know! "You almost want to tell them to call off the dogs and save some for tomorrow night"
As if you can do that!
I never call off my dogs!
;)
Time to empty the bench.
Holy crap! Just got back from a nearly 4-hr town meeting to find it 17-4!?!!
Off to check out box scores, comments, and foooood.
Keep scheduling those meetings, nick--seemed to do the trick.
HOLY SHIT! I had to leave for a bit---17 runs! OMG! We don't need any bullpen tonight.
Do you think this lead is safe?
just saw bot wandering around - tito may be worried ...
Nick, I hope your town hall was as good as this game. Democracy to spare.
Even I think this lead is safe. Even if Papelbon and RamRam are pitching. Even if Timlin came back to pitch.
Is the lead more, or less, safe if Bot comes in?
TIMLIN!!! What about Eric Gagne?
No, Timlin would blow it.
Gagne would definitely blow it. I still have nightmares about him. At least I have some positive memories of Timlin.
Maybe Van Every for an inning on the mound?
Timlin blew more games than Gagne ever saw as a Sock.
Good old Toast. How I don't miss him.
What the hell did these guys ingest since they left Baltimore??
Heidi's first game back in some time..........I'm just sayin'
Good point, Amy. We better make sure they all pee in a cup before they leave the park tonight.
I bet Gagne had a worse overall record with the Sox than Timlin did.
9C--you devil, you!
I love annual town meeting, though this one was frustrating at times. It easily could have been an hour shorter.
One of the big items was a petition to close one of our two public libraries and there was lots of organizing around opposing that. A guy got up (big proponent of keeping the library open) and made a motion to pass over the question. If passed it would be tabled dead. People who came to oppose the closing were audibly upset at that and refused to pass over the question, so we had to hear half an hour of people going on about it while clearly a massive majority would clap after each one. Move the question!
(/rant)
Yeah, where was Heidi? I heard her say she was glad to be back earlier, but missed why she had been away.
nick--Robert's Rules of Order take time to wind themselves out but patience winds out sooner sometimes
Heidi's back? That's totally it. Testosteroooooone!
Amy said...
Yeah, where was Heidi? I heard her say she was glad to be back earlier, but missed why she had been away
Something about a concussion he got in spring raining.
I'm sure Gagne's record was worse, but it's a much smaller sample size. Timlin sucked more often, was my point.
Amy: she got a concussion during spring break and has been on medical leave.
Yes, I think this win is because of Heidi. Mm-hm.
Thats where they practice only in the rain....
What was the final vote on the library, Nick?
Town meetings can be great, but also demonstrate often why democracy doesn't really work too well. But it is one of the things I love about living in a small New England town.
So are they gonna close the library?
NESN has also feel in love with HH's wife, showed her a few times in Toronto and also tonight alot....
9C LOL
How the hell did she get a concussion? Was she trying to catch a ball?
just hold 'em to 12, scott.
something about tek's headboard ...
Amy said...
How the hell did she get a concussion? Was she trying to catch a ball?
Is this one open to anything? ..:)
This could be a turning point. When I went away earlier it looked like the A's were getting ready to make a come back. 17 runs! Turning point. Looks like up from here.
LOL, 9C! You must be feeling very happy tonight---making us all laugh.
I am now feeling better about going to Fenway with Yankee fans on Saturday.
Are she and Tek still an item?
That was mean, Allan. I laughed loudly!
Michael Holloway said...
This could be a turning point.
Maybe.
Also not a reality, just closer to what it should be, especially at Fenway..
We are a cheery group tonight. What a nice change!
I think Heidi is several Sox away from Tek by now.
I just want to say I called it in my first post upthread.
2 CS from V-Mart. nice!
Amy said...
LOL, 9C! You must be feeling very happy tonight-
The magic of good sox baseball...
I think Heidi is several Sox away from Tek by now.
But Tek could still be one of the three stooges.
Come on, Schoenweiss. Don't make me eat my words about the lead being bullpen proof.
Heidi indulges in serial socksing?
we must be up by a lot -- no one mentioning bases loaded in the 9th
But Tek could still be one of the three stooges.
Then she's really got something going on. Good for her.
I did, Allan. You can always count on me to worry. Though I am not really worried.
Heidi indulges in serial socksing?
So they say. I only get my gossip in gamethreads, so I really don't know.
ZOMG they scored a run we are doomed etc etc
L-girl said...
But Tek could still be one of the three stooges.
Then she's really got something going on. Good for her.
Only in a 17-4 game to you hear L's true feelings on group sex...I like it...:}
Loaded bases have to insert a slight feeling of dis-ease whatever the fucking score....
Uh oh, we only have an eleven run lead now, and we still need one more out.
The library will stay open. The guy who started the petition to close it had some interesting points. He's lived here his whole life (61yo). We're a town of 7500 w/ 2 full public libraries. We also have a (small) college in town with a library open to townies. We just spent 3-4 million renovating the one in town. This one in the village of Housatonic (which periodically wants to secede from Great Barrington) will need 1-2 million for renovations/ADA issues in the next few years. We voted down replacing a 22yo fire truck, so we clearly have some budget concerns.
When we were up by 10 runs in the 7th, Obie said something about extra innings. I said, if we go into extra innings tonight, you can bet I won't be watching the game tomorrow night.
OK, we are down to single digit lead. WTF?
WTF? runs. that was foul.
That's a decent case for closing a library. But I'm still glad it will stay open. Not that I'm biased or anything.
Was that ball actually foul?
It sounds like all the towns around here (and probably almost anywhere these days). Not enough money, and difficult choices about where to cut: schools, library, public safety, infrastructure? It's terrible.
Only in a 17-4 game to you hear L's true feelings on group sex...I like it...:}
Holy shit, I just saw this! OMG I am cracking up.
That is all I will say!
the ump has $ on the run diff?
our public library here in Waterbury, lends out more DVD's than books....hence my spelling issues.
Nick--That's a lot of libraries for a town of 7500. Are they just geographically distant or specializing somehow?
Belfast Maine had three weekly newspapers for years.
I thought the ball was foul, but apparently no one on the Sox did. Or they didn't care to protest the call.
bring in van every for the last fucking out, pls.
CHRIST.
The vote was 90-odd % in favor of keeping it open, but he made a compelling argument, though it came far too late in the discourse. His letter to the editor on the subject last week was not very good.
Last out please!
Could we get this TF over with already??
TF, Laura?
sox radio said the batter was shaking his head, like damn, a foul, then was surprised when he ended up be able to go on to second.
TF as in WTF
Thank goodness!
DIRTY
FILTHY!
There really is DIRTY Water in Boston.
And it's about fucking time!
exhale...
schoeneweis just needed the extra work, i guess
muddy muddy muddy
The water is Muddy!!!.
Dirty!
Good night all! Hasta tomorrow.
Aha, I thought it was a noun.
More power to Housatonic if it's willing to put money up to maintain its character.
Good night, everyone. Let's hope we have really turned a corner.
g'night
Nothing good comes easily...
G'night all!
last library thing: Good for Housatonic for sure, but it requires money from all of GB, but in general the town is good with it.
5 HR more than the MFY. Beltre w/ 6 errors. World turned upside down.
Wow. This was fun. Got to watch it on the big screen at the bar while my buddies played almost right under it.
Fun!
Nice game, fun night with the Bruins and Celtics also winning!

I adore every single element of this soft, feminine bedroom from the drum pendent light fixture to the tufted headboard to the sunburst mirror. Oh, and don't get me started on those metallic, gold poufs!! The color of the walls and coordinating throw pillow is soothing and of course I love that Bungalow 5 Jacqui side table!!

After 11 years and 4 days online, the IJDb has shut down. It has been an absolute pleasure to run such a popular website for so long. I'd like to take this opportunity to try to thank the great many people that have helped, encouraged, hosted and inspire. In no particular order, Scott Seltzer, Tarim, Mini, Dave Barnes, Jay Linn, The Void, Luke Burrage, Jon Relf, Jon Kennett, The Void, Nils Cox, Stefan Paridaen, JiBe, Marco Paoletti, Guy Berman, Dani, Masaki Nishikawa, Rafael Porelorti, Matteo Vegetti, and finally a special thank you to Little Paul who has been a great help during the shutdown process.
Thank you to Rich Kohut for putting together this fantastic video:
I am really pleased that the news of the IJDb shutdown has resulted in the launch of a whole raft of promising looking websites. In no particular order:
As you can see, these sites pick up much of what the IJDb has left behind. The one notable exception is the great many articles that the site hosted (and were translated into about 7 different languages). Hopefully someone will find a use for these!
If you want to use any of the IJDb content, feel free. It will shortly be made available to everyone (with personal details removed), under a suitable licence.
Thank you all for being a part in this site.
Regards, Colin E.!

Camera Critters~ (for Feb 4, 2012) A Variery of critters...
~~~
~~~
At my house this week I had a few encounters with some critters...
There's always something 'WILD' going on in the country! :)
One day this week my son brought this little critter up to show me. He had rescued it from one of his cats. Luckily, the little guy was unharmed,
and we set it free in my courtyard ;
far away from his kitties.
I can't identify this lizard, can you?
Last night I had these 2 visitors to my back porch. They had come to dine on the food my cats had left on their plate!
I don't mind them coming to eat the leftovers...however, my poodle, Emmy, went wild barking at them through the glass door. I wish I could get better pictures but there's no way!
~~~
This is what Emmy does to her stuffed animal toys... Maybe she's thinking she could do that to those big old wild Raccoons.
Better think twice about that, Emma Rose!
~
Last, but certainly not least, (in size, that is) I went with my husband to the pasture yesterday to put out feed for the cattle.
As big as these critters are, they are not at all intimidating,
.... but I don't get close enough to 'pet' them!
:)
What critters have you seen recently?

What a cute critters you have around and in your home :)
Lovely shots.
Regards and best wishes
What a cute little Emma! No critters around here lately, thank goodness. Your raccoons look right at home. LOL
I'm skeered of them. :)
GOlly I don't have any idea what kind of lizard that is. I am not into reptiles at all. "shiver-shiver"
Your cattle are huge. I think I would feel intimidated even if there were a nice strong fence between us. LOL
You look so cute standing out there with the herd behind you. And brave too!
I probably shouldn't have smiled when I saw what Emma had done...but I did. :))
I don't know what kind of lizard that is...don't see those little critters around here much. Emmy us a hoot...watch out raccoons. Have a good week Junie... ~Joy
Our Buddy does the Same thing to his stuffed animals...sigh...I'm just not going to buy him anymore.
Love the feeding shots Junie!
hughugs
Haying cattle in shorts in February would be considered 'showing off' in these parts. We need to wear pants long enough to keep the snow off of our knees. :)
Me thinks you'll need a different dog before you open the door on the racoons. Something a little bigger and meaner.
I'm not sure I knew you raised that many cattle! Charles must stay pretty busy.
We've only seen raccoons once here in my world. We are surrounded by wooded areas but they seem to stay away.
Hope you're having a great week Junie!

I’m prematurely aged. Or, at least I am if you look at the ads on the TV I watch. “Franklin Mint”:? Check. “Hoveround”:? Check. Good times, good times. But never did I think that I would see an ad like this one:
(I tried to embed the video here, but you’ll have to “go to here to see it”: because, apparently, Flash is too complex for me.)
Hasbro: where little girls’ dreams go to die. Unless those dreams are of doing laundry for everyone. Want a Rose Petal Cottage for to get your little Elizabeth Cady back in line? Hasbro has a “fun Flash experience for you”:, complete with an ad just for girls! (That other ad is for moms.)
Honestly? I guess the Rose Petal Cottage is great for girls who “plan to get their Mrs. degree”:. Somebody needs to send one of these houses to the Suicide Girls or something.

(via just-smith)
Calling a woman anything related to “men” or any iteration of masculinity does not have the connotations of calling a man being related to femininity. Most women will not be offended will being called a dick like men can be when called a pussy. It’s just not the same thing because femininity within women is not held to be as sacred as masculinity within men.
(via iamabutchsolo)
It does with all of the women I know, and even if it didn’t, the ‘similar set of slurs’ point still stands. I think women are going to be less sensitive because they’ve had feminism to free them a lot more than men have. To me it’s more to do with the imbalance in gender equality than any imbalance in gender inequality. If this does show (as you say) that the male gender construct is stronger, it’s even more ridiculous for the OP to twist it to suggest that only women have problems.
(via just-smith)
The OP was not suggesting that “only women have problems,” but that the slurs often hurled at men basically relate them to being women, or having female qualities, which offends men because we’re socialized to see femininity as being weaker. Feminism has tried to show that it’s okay for men to be feminine and women to be masculine, but the way that people hold onto masculinity is a product of patriarchy and not feminism.
(via iamabutchsolo)
She said that this was proof of sexism (against women) and that no equivalent (sexism) against men existed. The way men hold on to masculinity is a product of patriarchy, yes.
The way women hold on to femininity is also a product of patriarchy, but you yourself said that we see this less. That’s nothing to do with an imbalance in the patriarchy, because women were originally restricted just as much as men. The fact that women are freer today, and that more women want to be masculine, is a product of feminism - and a good one. You can say feminism tried to do the same for men, but the reality is that the vast vast majority of feminists have been campaigning solely for women. I’m not saying that that is a bad thing. All I’m saying is that men have been temporarily left behind due to this imbalance, and that is what is accountable for the discrepancy.

Wyoming News Briefs, planting ponderosa seedlings and building erosion barriers.
JACKSON, Wyo. (AP) —. He hopes to be able to come back to Jackson Hole someday.
RAWLINS, Wyo. (AP) — The city of Rawlins has been down to one doctor certified in obstetrics. Carbon County Memorial Hospital officials say they are working on recruiting OB doctors to the area. Hospital CEO Ned Hill maintains there is no emergency situation with just one OB doctor. The only other option for patients is driving to Laramie or Casper.
LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) — Brett Smith passed for four touchdowns and ran for another in leading Wyoming past Colorado State 45-31 on Saturday. It is the Cowboys’ longest win streak in the more than 100-game series between the two schools since they won seven in a row from 1967-73. It also marked the return of Wyoming coach Dave Christensen, who was suspended for the previous game against Boise State after a loss to Air Force on Oct. 13 when he berated Falcons coach Troy Calhoun.

In 2009 I bought a G1, back when it was the only Android phone available. Immediately I became frustrated because none of the available music players were capable of recognizing my music because I didn’t have perfect track information embedded on my files. They all gave me one pool with hundreds of songs named track1, track2, track3… Or they would have multiple different entries for the same band. For example: AC/DC, AC_DC, AC DC and ACDC.
To solve this, I developed KalinPlayer, which I used every day for a year and a half as my music player. I never got all the kinks worked out to the point where I felt comfortable releasing it to the public, but it worked for me and that’s what was important.
I did intend to finish and release it, so I built a screenshots and instructions page to show the different features and an explanation page, where I gripe about how other music players just don’t stack up.

Utley awarded fourth Silver Slugger
Second baseman has held grip on honor for past four years
PHILADELPHIA -- Phillies second baseman Chase Utley continues to be recognized as the best second baseman in the National League.
It was announced on Thursday that he won his fourth consecutive Silver Slugger Award.
Utley hit .282 with 28 doubles, four triples, 31 home runs and 93 RBIs this season, helping the Phillies make the World Series for the second successive year.
Utley leads Major League second basemen in runs (456), hits (711), RBIs (400), on-base percentage (.392) and slugging percentage (.535) over the past four seasons. He also ranks second in home runs (121), third in doubles (156) and walks (262), fourth in triples (17) and fifth in average (.304).
He also has been hit by a pitch 90 times, which leads the Majors. The next closest player is San Francisco Giants center fielder Aaron Rowand, who has been hit 65 times.
"Sometimes I don't even like to talk about him, because he doesn't want me to," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said about Utley during the World Series. "Actually, he doesn't like for you to say a whole lot of things about him. But he's one of the most prepared, one of the most dedicated -- he has the most desire and passion to play the game of any player that I've ever been around.

"But Chase Utley is one of the most ... he's a pleasure to be around and he's a pleasure to manage. I mean that, and I could not say enough about him because that's what I think about him. I don't want to embarrass him or nothing like that, but sometimes I tell our players, 'Just play with Chase,' because if you play with Chase, you've got a chance to be a pretty good player."
Since 1980, winners of the Silver Slugger Award have been chosen by votes of Major League managers and coaches, prohibited from selecting players from their own teams.
Mike Schmidt holds the franchise record with six Silver Sluggers (1980-84, '86).

Aw happy birthday to him! What a cute picture of the two of you!
Busch Gardens, the only cold day all year I think! :)
I love that verse - we had it read at our wedding, but I'm sure many people have it read at their weddings... Sounds like a wonderful husband with a sweet wife to write him such a post for his birthday.
Awww, thanks. He's definitely the better one of the two of us. I married up as they say :)
My advice to all the girls who want a husband like Rob... DON'T SETTLE FOR LESS THAN THE BEST!!!!
Happy Birthday to your wonderful husband Karen! Romantic post, how lucky he is to have a wife like you :)
Karen,
Happy Birthday to your forever love...We also read 1 Corinthians 13 at our wedding....it always makes me smile (you know that deep inside kind of smile...)
Happy Valentine's Day to you both.
Peace and good.
Very sweet!! Happy Birthday to your husband!
It's always so wonderful to see women posting positives about their husbands. In this day and age, it is not as common as it probably should be!
Love that passage...it was a reading at my wedding! Happy Bday to him!
Happy birthday (hugs) to Rob! The love verses are among my favorite in all of scripture. How to act in love, in a nutshell.
Barb,
It wouldn't be Rob's birthday without your hug :)
Love you,
me :)
Awww, How sweet! Happy Birthday Rob! Hope he had a great day. I'm sure you made it extra special!!

Recent advances in drilling technologies have unleashed a boom in domestic natural gas production. The United States may have more than 100 years' worth of gas reserves, and perhaps much more, including large untapped resources in Michigan.

I just this minute finished red pen revisions of my latest manuscript. Long-time readers of this blog will remember ZF-360, my retelling of Mozart's Magic Flute, set in modern-day Manhattan and Kashkawan among the Irish Travellers.
Well, I've entirely rewritten it, and I'm very happy with it now. Irish folk music figures heavily in the story; my male lead plays in a Celtic fusion band and receives an Abell ZF-360 pennywhistle as a gift.
As I went through the printed manuscript today, catching tiny errors on virtually every page, I also made a list of all the songs I mention in the story. Most are Irish folk songs, but some are not. Here's the playlist, with links where available:
"Katie Campbell's Rambles"
"The Green Gates"
"Bold Doherty"
"Summer is Coming"
"The Water is Wide"
"My Funny Valentine"
"Clohinne Winds"
"As I Roved Out"
"Strange Fruit"
"Body and Soul"
"Stella By Starlight"
"Ships Are Sailing"
"The Lakes of Coolfin"
"Horo Johnny"
"I's the B'y"
"The Creggan White Hare"
"The Dawning of the Day"
"The Flower of Magherally"
"Green Grow the Rushes"
"An Paistin Fionn"
"Rant and Roar"
"Blackbirds and Thrushes"

I know a few people who seem addicted to chaos. They appear to be drama magnets, emotional "black holes," if you will. It seems like something is always going wrong for them, and then those of us around them get to hear all about the crisis-of-the-moment at length. Again and again.
There's a fine line between expressing frustration and chronic complaining. I'm not judging these acquaintances. I try to offer help and support, or just a listening ear, depending on what's needed and/or requested.
Here's the thing. I'm sure that what I see in these perceived drama addicts is much more about me than it is about them. Indeed, my observations direct me inward and remind me of what I need to change and repair in my own life and psyche.
I'm grateful for opportunities to practice compassion and empathy. I treasure the luxury of feeling understood and loved despite my many faults, and so I attempt to communicate my understanding and love of others and their difficulties whenever possible.
But I am often struck by how exhausting and contagious negativity can be. For someone like me, who already struggles with depression and anxiety, that negativity is as dangerous as a riptide. I find it's better just to stay out of the water and hold out a helping hand from the safety of the shore.
One of my long-term goals is to be drama-free. Of course, bad things happen to us all. But when trials come my way, I hope to be able to take them in stride. I'm fine with grieving, or even ranting and moping--privately, to those I trust--when appropriate. But if I am to live in a world that is less chaotic, the calm amidst the storm needs to start with me.]]>
I spent last Friday and Saturday in a Huntington Beach condo that was four blocks from the ocean. I did not surf; I did not sunbathe, even though the weather was sunny and warm. Nope--I sat in a quiet, empty room, all alone, and wrote like a madwoman.
How does a madwoman write, you ask?
Impossible? Not when you've trained for it. It was the equivalent of competing in an Ironman: death and despair for a newbie, but totally doable for someone who has conditioned and worked consistently over a considerable amount of time.
I couldn't have done it without Rachel Aaron's help. Over a year ago, I read her blog posts that led to her ebook on writing faster and more efficiently, and I've been working ever since to improve both the quality and quantity of my writing. (Get the book! It's worth way more than the 99 cents you'll spend. Get Rachel's other books, too.)
I don't write this to brag; I write this to tell you what's possible when you do the daily work that Steven Pressfield and so many other pros prescribe.
And now? I had thought I'd jump into revisions right after the holiday weekend, but, like a post-Ironman athlete, I found I've needed a couple of extra days off to recover. But today, a week after my marathon, I'm ready to tackle the rewrites to make the story I love much, much better.
Last weekend was my first Writers' Retreat. Would I do another? Absolutely. But I'm glad I was prepared to make it worth every minute away from my family. All the writing I do when I'm at home in the thick of my life--that's where I make the real advances.]]>

{sneak peek} eagle river engagement | sarah & aaron
We LOVE Wisconsin. And after last weekend’s session, we know that we love us some Aaron and Sarah. This is just a peek at their amazing, cozy, adorable Northwoods engagement session! The best part? This was almost all shot out on Sarah’s parent’s land, near the home they built on the cutest little lake. It was like a dream, and we probably said that eighteen times while exploring the property with them! Congratulations to Aaron and Sarah, and more on the way soon…
Love,
Kate & Sam

In this post, I’m going to show you how to further reinforce (and cover) the cut edges of your steek using a techique that I’ve called “the steek sandwich.” There are many other methods of binding / covering steek edges – but this one works well, I think, for a steeked cardigan. The front edges of a cardigan generally see a lot of strain because of the opening / closing action of buttons and button holes – and this method provides a strong facing as well as a stable edge where the garment needs it most.
Above, you can see the wrong side of the swatch where we left it yesterday, with the steek cut, and the crocheted reinforcement holding the cut edge. In the steps that follow, I’m just going to describe exactly what I’m doing, and provide a little more explanation at the end.
First, with the right side of the swatch facing, pick up and knit 3 stitches for every 4 rows, plus an extra 1 stitch each for the top and bottom edges. (I’m using yarn in a contrasting colour so you can see what I’m doing).
For the edging to sit flush against the main pattern, you should pick up your stitches in the gap between the outermost steek stitch and the first stitch of the pattern. In the diagram below, there are two pattern stitches on either side, and five steek stitches in the middle. The pink lines show you where you should be picking up your stitches.
When picking up your stitches, make sure you push your needle all the way through to the back of the work, and draw the yarn through from the wrong side (this may sound obvious, but people do pick up stitches in quite different ways . . . ) So, when you have finished, you should be able to see the backs of your picked up stitches on the reverse of the fabric.
The backs of your stitches should resemble a line of sewn running stitch. And just as a running stitch would, these stitches are further securing and holding the cut edge of your steek. That steek is going nowhere!
Now, beginning with a purl row, work in stockinette for four rows.
Keep these stitches live on the needle: don’t break yarn.
Here are these four rows from the right side.
And here they are from the wrong side, with stitches 1 and 2 of the steek, and the chain of the crocheted reinforcement visible behind them.
Sitting underneath the steek, you’ll see the back loops of your previously picked up stitches.
Now without knitting, pick up each of these loops and place them on a second needle:
Bring the working yarn round from the right side, and work in stockinette for 3 rows, beginning with a knit row.
Keep these stitches live on your needle: don’t break yarn.
The sandwich is now forming: four rows of stockinette on the right side, three on the wrong side, and, in the middle, the steek stitches and their crocheted reinforcement.
This next step is a bit fiddly, so take your time.
Turn the work to the right side.
You have two sets of stitches running parallel to one another: one set on the front, and one on the back needle.
Bring the working yarn around from the back and, with a third needle, knit one stitch from the front needle together with one stitch from the back needle, covering and containing the steek stitches and the crochet chain. When you have knitted each front-needle stitch together with its corresponding back-needle stitch, you end up with this.
A neat stockinette facing!
And here’s what it looks like from the wrong side:
All that remains is to bind off the live stitches. Here, I’ve used an i-cord bind-off (knit 2; knit 2 together through-the-back-loops) (particularly useful if you are working a button / buttonhole band).
Here’s the finished sandwich from the right side . . .
. . . and the wrong side.
Voila! the steek sandwich.
I particularly like the fact that:
1) if you work an even number of rows from the right side, and an odd number from the wrong side, you never have to break yarn
2) Because you just pick up the reverse loops from the right-side stitches, you end up with two perfectly aligned stockinette flaps that can neatly be knitted together.
3) No need to worry about whether you’ve picked up the right number of stitches on either side: the number of stitches is always, inevitably the same!
4) You can weave in your ends by pulling them inside the sandwich.
Points of note:
:: You can of course, work more rows to create a deeper facing. I’ve worked the minimum here: just enough to fit the steek and and its reinforcement inside.
:: I worked the i-cord bind-off from the wrong side. Personally, I like the way this looks.
:: The ‘sandwich’ is formed from three layers of fabric and, as you’d imagine, has a solid, almost quilted appearance. I think this is great for the front openings of a cardigan, where a facing is often necessary anyway. It also works well as a blanket edging, but because it adds bulk, would probably not work so well elsewhere.
If this rain ever stops, I’ll soon be able to show you how the sandwich looks on a finished garment!
Also, I noticed that there were some good questions on my previous couple of posts. I thought I’d answer a few of these (those that I can!) in a final installment of this steek series tomorrow, so if there is anything you want to know that I’ve not covered, or that seems unclear, please say something below.
When you knit one stich from the front and one stitch from the back together, could you also knit the ending loop from the crochet chain or would that pull on the chain and make it less stable? Also you say you use this technique for button-bands, is the whole facing the button band or do you then pick up stitches from the facing to create the button band?
Thank you for the clear images. I think I will have to finally try steeks soon!
Laurence B’s second question is just what I was going to ask. So that makes two of us who want to know how to go from sandwich to button band. The buttonhole band is even more finicky – or do you always use snaps for closure and buttons for ornament?
Kate:
That’s beautiful and neat.
Gives me confidence to try a steek. I’m going to do a swatch as you have shown and give ‘er a whirl.
Excellent , clear directions and photos
Thank you
Donna
This is all really wonderful… thanks so much for your quite clear explanations. Will you also show how this relates to a button band?
Thank you!
This is a fabulous way to finish the front of a cardign………my question is, why do you have to initially finish your ends by weaving them into the fabric of the body.
When yarns are stopped and started in the middle of the steek……all of these ends are trimmed off when the steek is cut, in whatever steek treatment used, eliminating the need for them to be woven in.
I look forward to your new pattern using this technique.
Your explanations have been great & have gotten me over my fear of steeks & actually eager to start my first Fair Isle project & first steeking. One question, instead of using an I-cord bind-off, could you close the steek sandwich with a 3-needle bind-off instead? Thank you, Kate, for being so generous as to share your expertise.
Thanks Kate! I love your designs and will be getting your lovely sheepy blanket kit soon (I hope). This will be a great way to finish it.
Best wishes!
-Alice
Thank you so much for this; I’m inspired!
Thanks for this – sorted out my issues with picking up stitches. Brilliant, clear tutorial, thank you.
this set of tutorials is so clear, you’ve inspired me to try and steek! I really appreciate the time that’s obviously gone into them, thank you :)
As I anticipated, a beautiful, robust cardigan facing! Be still my heart! I am now looking forward to this pattern even more:-B
Such a neat solution!Look forward to learning more!
Okay, that is officially the smartest thing I’ve ever seen. Thank you so much for sharing this whole series!
Hear, hear!
That is just so cool! I’ve actually never really heard of steeks before so this has been very eye opening. Thanks for the time you spent on this, I’m now excited to give it a try!
Thanks so much for the wonderful steek tutorials, with so many detailed directions and excellent photos. For me it is perfect timing, as I am just about ready to do my “Rams and Yowes” steek. I appreciate how much time and effort you have put into this!
This series is the first thing I’ve read about steeks that has not been terrifying. Something very bracing about your tone, Kate. Thank you for all the reassurance in the first part. Without that I wouldn’t have been able to move on to the subsequent parts. It doesn’t really make me want to run out and steek something, but I’ll be much less likely to dismiss a pattern immediately upon seeing the word “steek” as I have been wont to do.
What a great,beautiful, wonderful finishing technique – bravo, Kate!!! Just to clarify, when picking up the original 3 stitches out of every 4 rows, it looks like you picked them up one column outside of the 5 steek stitches you numbered in part 1, i.e. what would have been the original edge of a traditionally knit front? Thanks soooooooo much for all this :) :)
Really clear directions; I’m ten times more confident about steeking than before. Might even try it one day!
Thank you for your patient explanation, now I can consider doing the Sheep & Yows blanket (I’ve done the tam – so that’s one mountain climbed!) Can I show my total ignorance and ask you to clarify the i-cord bind off…now that’s scary!!
Thank you Kate for this very clear explanation and very clear pictures. You rock!!!
This is so fantastic! Thank you so much for taking the time to create this tutorial!
Fabulous tutorial, thank you so much!
I expect this way of finishing would work just as well for an “ordinary” cardigan edge… wouldn’t it?
Just got back from yoga feeling blissfully happy and thought hey lets have my dinner and check out the traffic on the blogosphere. Yippee there’s a post from Kate about steaks – what is the history of this word I’m wondering – anything to do with steaks – is it pronouced completely differently. I’m not really a knitter but love the blog. Anna x, ps its raining here too in Devon, still – the ducks are happy but the lambs have had enough.
Love it !!! I’m on the edge of my seat !
Wow! What a super cool method, and you make it look so easy! I can’t wait to try.
You. are. a. genius.
That’s all. I’m in awe!
Thanks so much Kate for your time doing this. My question is would you be able to show on swatch where you picked up the (3 sts into 4 rows) stitches.
Yes, I’d also like to know how far in from the edge of the steek to pick up and knit the first layer of the sandwich.
Also, I’m wondering: you said that the number of picked up stitches always should equal exactly the number of loops showing on the back of the fabric (those that are used to create the last layer of the sandwich). But, according to the “fence post rule,” there is almost one more post than section of fence, so shouldn’t there be one fewer stitches on the back side than on the front, leaving you with one extra stitch on the front side when you are knitting the sandwich together? I also could state my question this way: if one were to pick up and knit stitches using yarn that wasn’t attached to anything first, then the yarn would come up from the back side of the fabric to the front create a stitch over the needle, and descend again to the back side. The actual “loops” on the back side are created BETWEEN the new stitches that are being picked up on the front side, so wouldn’t there be one fewer loops on the back than there are new stitches on the front?
Finally, for those of us who are not familiar with the i-cord bind off especially in this setting, would you please demonstrate this in a photo tutorial? Thank you. That was the only place in your absolutely magnificent post that I felt as if a step got skipped over a bit too quickly.
I have to say: I have always believed that I couldn’t steek anything because I don’t own a sewing machine. I am very comfortable crocheting and thrilled that I could actually make a steek without the benefit of sewing.
Great tutorial, thanks!
The closest I’ve ever come to steeking was with a stockinette cardigan knit in a worsted weight wool. In the end, I wimped out because it seemed as though the button band would be too bulky. Any words of wisdom about steeking with heavier-weight wools?
Beautiful! I love it. Just one question: Which column of stitches do you pick up your “sandwich” stitches from? From the last column of the steek? Or the first pattern column? Or something else altogether?
I’m not afraid of steeks, but I’ve never tried them. This tutorial serie is the best : so clear and well explained.
That last part on the sandwich is just brilliant ! Thank you so much for writing this, Kate.
Ok, now I find the urge to knit the Rams and Yowes blanket even stronger !
Thank you so much for this tutorial. I have always been afraid of steeks. Now I can’t wait to give it a try.
I do have one question about the crocheting bit. Does the weight of the yarn used make a difference? Should it be the same or lesser weight than the garment?
Thanks a bunch.
Quick question – have you ever just picked up on one side (the front) and then knitted for say 8 rows and then did a 3 needle bind off using the backs of the initial knitted up stitches? I know Dale patterns from Norway use this method a lot for facings and I must admit its beautiful. You could then do a picot edge if you want half way – is that possible do you think with the steek – any problems you would anticipate – I am truly in awe of your work – thats so much. I recently got my scottish citizenship by ancestry and I madly knit J&S and Kate Davies patterns!! I am a very happy knitter. :)
How nice and kneat!
My question relates to this instruction “When picking up your stitches, make sure you push your needle all the way through to the back of the work, and draw the yarn through from the wrong side”. So are you creating new stitches thru the knitting rather than picking up stitch from the front ie the already knitted stitches?
Thank you so much Kate, this has to be the best explanation of steeking that I’ve ever seen and I am not going to let the tag “steek” put me off patterns again.
Thank you, Kate; I have the Rams & Yowes kit from J&S – knew it was going to be a learning curve with steeks, but this explanation is so clear. Looking forward to making a start!
Thank you for the lovely tutorial. It’s very thorough and clear.
I LOVE your steek series!!!
Instead of the I-cord bind off, could the front and back “facings” be kitchenered?
That produces such a lovely clean finish. Thanks for those 3 posts, I really enjoy cutting up my knitting, I’ll be able to do it so much neater now!
Steek sandwich… Mmm…
Thank you so much for this steek series. I was just considering cutting my first steek and your tutorials are exactly what I need!
waouuuu ! These techniques seem so clear : I’m looking forward a peerie flower cardigan for a looong time…I just try to finish all my knitting affairs to be ready to start your new creation !
Thanks a lot for the precious tutorial and the time you take for explanations !
Cathy
Another fabulous explanation. However, my steeks are rather thick already as I have finished all my ends within the steek – all done before I read your instructions. I will try the steek sandwich on my next steeking adventure…. Onwards with the other armhole today!
I really wish I could have read this post before I spent £40 plus travel on a steeking class where the teacher announced there wouldn’t be anything much about finishing (in a 3-hour class!!). Excellent, thank you.
Thank you for sharing your knowledge and expertise with us. That is an absolutely gorgeous finish.
Wow! Thank you SO much for explaining steeks in so much detail. Your posts actually make me want to cut up my knitting. I will be using this.
You, madame, are a GENIUS! These posts are going to my bookmarks and my printer, I’ll be doing this soon! THANK YOU!
Second the genius part :-).
I’m thinking also that instead of knitting the edges together a nice 3-needle bind-off would be perfect for a strong, stable edge such as a neckline. Wow, I can feel a steek coming on :-).

Hi Everyone,
I've been away from the blog because I don't have much quilting progress to report. Except that I'm still on Easy Street, have all my patches done and finished sewing all my "B" blocks together. I still have to make 7 "A" blocks, and 3 set-in triangles. Sigh... I'll get it done eventually. Right now I decided to take a short break.
This weekend while we had Winter Storm Nemo howling through dumping 15 inches of snow on us I finished basting my Baby Boy Blue quilt tops. Yes, both of them! I only have phone pictures, but they'll have to do for now. By the time I was finished I ran out of safety pins. I'm not gonna say I had just enough because I could've used a few more for safety, but it's alright.
While I was basting the boyz were hanging out on the futon next to me. Guess what were they doing...
As some of you know yesterday we went for a hike in the afternoon with a goal of taking some pictures of the sunset from the top of a hill that's about 3 miles from our house. It never occurred to me that the snow will be knee deep (we got 15 inches of it, hello?) and only had sweat pants and an ankle high pair of boots on with ankle socks. Clever, isn't it? By the time we got half way up the hill my ankle was frozen from all the snow and so was my shin. I just couldn't feel my legs! So we turned back and marched home defeated. I have to mention that it was almost 5:30 and we were late for the 5:23 sunset anyway. I saw no point of continuing.
We took the kitties outside this morning and have some pictures of them enjoying the snow too :)
Looking for trouble!
He's a nice size kitty and the snow is still above him
His Royalness is so serious!
Notice that he's sitting on TOP of the snow!

Attention, the snowball is in the air! :)
In the afternoon we went out to the park to look around and decided to take the hike again with the modification of taking the car up to the park and just climb the hill which was about half a mile long. I was still sore from yesterday and was really glad Fiance decided to drive there this time. I was still having a hard time trying to balance to step into his footsteps to get the least amount of snow in my boots as possible. It was fascinating that no one, but us were there since last night.
The ducks were having a blast at the park:
Someone went cross-country skiing:
The view from top of the hill:
Cool ripples made by the wind:
Love the way the sky looks!
Now I think I'm done for the day :)
I'll be back with the questions answered part 2, but right now I can't even think straight.
'Til we blog again!
Oh how I envy you all the lovely snow ;)! It looks so beautiful, doesn't it? And your Kitties are enjoying it too it seems.
I love both your Baby Boy Blue tops. How are you going to quilt them? By machine or hand?
Love the quilt, love your photos and loooovvvveee your cats x
I love the color combination that you used:)))
I just love your quilts. Great pictures of your snow storm.
I just love your quilts. Great pictures of your snow storm.
Your cats "weather" the snow a lot better than my cats! My cats are strictly indoor and we had a couple of inches, and when they ran out the door, they ran right back in and were licking their paws until they were satisfied all the offensive cold, wet snow was off of their paws! LOL I loved your pictures!
Thank you for sharing these beautiful photos! You have very attractive cats!
The quilts are beautiful! .....and so are the cats :) Glad you survived the storm!
Great job on getting both quilts all basted,they look beautiful already! Also thank you for sharing all the lovely snow photos,they take the breath away :0) Sorry to hear about your not so fun hike,but glad that you were able to get to the top of the hill anyway! The kitties look to have had a great time playing in the snow!
So beautiful quilts. And your cats are so lovely and cute.

T-ara’s first official album Jewelry Box will hit the shelves on June 6.
As soon as the subscription sale began on April 19, the album was placed the top and third on a daily subscription sales chart of Tower Record, the biggest online music market in Japan.
Some representatives of big recording companies say, “T-ara’s first official album is receiving explosive reactions from fans and is ranked at the top of a daily chart. We’re expecting it to be sold over 300,000 to 400,000 copies.”
T-ara’s agency in Japan, Core Contents Media Japan, says, “If the group’s album sells over 500,000 copies, we will hold a free guerrilla concert in main streets of Korea and Tokyo.”
Jewelry Box includes Japanese version of “Bo Peep Bo Peep,” “Yayaya,” “Roly Poly,” “Lovey Dovey,” and some new songs that are yet to be revealed.
Currently, T-ara is preparing for its concert in Japan which will be held next month and an inauguration ceremony of its fan club on July 14. The group will be meeting their fans with a new album this summer.

Alki Kayak Tours
1660 Harbor Avenue SW
Seattle, WA 98126
View Larger Map
Alki Kayak Tours works to provide a safe, comfortable paddling experience for everyone. We will outfit you with a kayak suitable for your size and experience level and provide you with all the necessary equipment. Please read through our frequently asked questions and don’t hesitate to let us know if you have any other burning questions!
Q: What adventure gear or kayak travel equipment should I bring?
A: Alki Kayak Tours provides all sea kayaking equipment, you provide a sense for adventure. Besides that, the clothing you’ll need to wear includes shoes/sandals you don’t mind getting wet..
Q: What if I have never been in a sea kayak?
A: No experience is necessary! And you don’t need to know how to swim. The only prerequisite is a spirit of adventure. While our trips are not designed to be strenuous, generally good physical condition is needed. If you are comfortable with a couple of hours of outdoor physical activity, you should be fine.
Q: What about capsizing?
A: Sea kayaking is a completely different sport than white water kayaking. Our Seascape 2 double kayaks are 21 feet long and provide a stable paddling platform, and capsizes are rare. There are no “wet exits” required and if you follow the guides instructions you will be able to safely paddle through any conditions.
Q: Are there any age limits?
A: There are no age limits, but you need to weigh at least 80 lbs. to safely operate the kayak. However, we have acquired a triple kayak and can take younger/lighter paddlers on calm days on some of the shorter paddles. Call or email for any specific concerns or questions. Generally any kids under 5 should stay home with a sitter so you can come out and enjoy yourself.
Q: I was blessed with ample hips, will I fit in the kayak?
A: You will be sitting in a confined cockpit for about 1.5 hours at a time. The seat is 17″ wide and the total boat capacity is 600 lbs for both paddlers. Come out early if you think you might want to see if you can comfortably sit in the kayak.
Q: What if it is nasty weather?
A: Contrary to popular belief, we have pretty darn awesome weather here in the NW if you are geared up correctly. We go rain or shine, so bring your breathable rainjacket with a hood. We use spray skirts, and paddling in the NW is a year round activity. We have a micro-climate rainshadow effect here in West Seattle and are positioned so that southerly low pressure systems break over the peninsula and we have a “donut hole” of blue over our shop while it may be raining in North/South and East of us. But yes it does get stormy occasionally, and we will call off trips due to high winds or unsafe conditions.

The Aberdeen Timberland Library will reopen on Monday, August 13 as planned. The library has been closed since July 30 for a facility improvement project.
“All of the high traffic area improvements to the restrooms, carpets, and walls have been completed,” wrote Aberdeen Timberland Library Manager Christine Peck in an email. Additional work will be completed during regular hours including some carpet work, parking lot improvements, and installation of new HVAC controls said Peck. Library lounge furniture will be reupholstered later this fall.
Patrons’ hold items—books, DVDs, CDs, magazines and other items—listed as available for pickup at the Aberdeen Timberland Library have been at the Hoquiam Timberland Library during the closure. After Friday, August 10 those items will be sent back to the Aberdeen library and will be available from Monday, August 13 through Saturday, August 18.

Lee-similar story. About a year ago I played a down under round with a large group and then got engaged in some enthralling conversation with two people the entire walk back to my car in the main lot. I got in and started to drive off. I got to the Rosedale exit and was waiting to make the right turn onto mission when the alarm went off in my head. Where the F*CK is Sophie?! As I frantically turned around Brian Palmer called my cell and was like "um dude, are you stlll here your dog is wandering around with a bunch of us up top on #7". Having walked up from down under I would have had no idea where to start looking for her had BP not called me, despite the fact I only abandoned her for about 10 minutes. I had no idea if she followed me partially to the car or not at all-she is usually at my heels or nearby. I felt awful. Needless to say everytime I leave the course now I look back in my backseat like three times to make sure she is there. I'm glad this story ended happily, and big props to Jose and BJ for lovin' that cooter! And a big thanks to BP for calling me that day-I'm sure I thanked you but I don't think I expressed how grateful I was/am!
Everyone else who moves the baskets apparently only know how to move them shorter, so I only move them long. Good night for league. Shannon Carson hit an ace then won in a one-hole playoff on the hole he had aced. Pretty sweet.Scores and details later.
Palmer, you could have had a chance to show off all that new found distance you've been talking about!

My Squirrelly View of Education
Trying to Integrate Technology into HS English & Special Education
Thing 4
Adequate Yearly Progress, Education, Education in the United States, FlintMichigan, GeneralMotors, GM, High school, Michigan, NCLB, No Child Left Behind Act November 10, 2008
How has learning changed? In some ways, a lot. In others, not so much.
A couple of quotes form the Time Magazine article really struck me..
2. .”
These skills have always been necessary and have been developed in High Schools pre-NCLB. I learned these things in my High School Debate and Forensics program at Kearsley High School in Flint, MI. Unfortunately, few students took advantage of the opportunities these programs provided. In the 70′s my blue-collar high school was a “prep school” for the GM factories ran the city. Less than 3% of my class went to college. Those that did, did not return to Flint. As we graduated from college we witnessed the first round of GM’s downsizing that would turn downtown Flint into a relative ghost town. At my 5-year class reunion in 1980, there were classmates who had been laid off from GM never to return. For many of my classmates lacked the ability to adapt to change, to think outside the box, and to see opportunities in the future. The few who did, got retraining and left.
I think that if we are to serve our students, we must stress these same skills, so that they can meat the challenges our changing economy brings. Right know I have a since of deja vu. I feel that I am watching Monroe struggle with the same problems that Flint has and still is facing.
I fear that Michigan’s new graduation requirements, while admirable, when combined with the high stakes test, the Michigan Merit exam and NCLB’s AYP requirements will force schools to teach to the test rather than allow students the chance to create and explore this new world.
The appropriate use of web2.0 collaborative learning is a step in the right direction, but it is only a step. We need to get our students ask the “Why and How” questions when confronted an issue just like I was trained to do in Mrs. Turner’s Debate Class. The question “Why is this happening?” can lead to powerful critical thinking. It can challenge our beliefs, our thought processes. It can lead to creative solutions to complex problems. Likewise, the question “How can this be changed?” can lead all of us to create new answers.
This weekend I watched my 18 year son, a UofM-Dearborn freshman struggle with an argumentative essay for his composition class. He knows how to structure and write a competent paper, but he is lacking the ability to develop a complete, persuasive argument. He can use the web, but he lacks the facility to use any search engine other than the basic Google search. This kid is a math major (“Mom, calculus is fun. Get over it!”). He graduated with honors from a great high school that regularly turns out Merit Scholars. He took computer software classes, yet he was never taught basic web skills. I fear that we are and will continue to turn out students like him who look good on paper, but lack the skills and the thought processes to handle this complex world.
In one of my presentations on Web 2.0 and 21st century teaching and learning, I show a picture of my dad and my 2 sons. My dad never graduated from high school. He served in WWII, and when he came home he got a job with GM and worked there for 30 years. We weren’t rich, but he earned enough to buy a car and a home. Contrast that with my sons’ generation. Even with a college degree, they will have a hard time keeping the same job for 30 years.
I know the new HS graduation requirements are good for the colleges and universities, but I also worry that with such an emphasis on core subjects and high stakes tests, we will see an increasing percentage of students (those who aren’t good at playing school) become even more frustrated and likely to drop out.
I have the same fears that you do about the new HS requirements. Heck, I couldn’t have passed Algebra II when I was in HS. I’m doing just find in this new age.

Video: Police leave woman topless, toothless in holding cell
(CNN/WESH) – An Ocala woman is suing the Lake County Sheriff’s Office and the Leesburg Police Department over what she calls inhumane treatment.
Ashleigh Davis was arrested at the Leesburg Bikefest in April 2011. She admits she was drunk, disorderly and probably deserved to be arrested, but she said it’s what happened after the arrest that prompted her to file a lawsuit.
Davis said her bikini top came off during the arrest and was left off for hours.
She was carted through the crowd, her hands and feet tied behind her back, while she was topless, Davis said. She said she was placed in a holding cell and left there shirtless.
Davis said a handful of male deputies and officers laughed at her and made no attempt to ever cover her up. The incident was caught on surveillance video from inside the holding cell, WESH 2 reported.
Davis said when one of the law enforcement officers put his hand over her mouth to quiet her from shouting, she bit the officer’s hand, and that’s when he threw her to the ground, shattering three of her front teeth.
Davis’ attorney, Stan Plappert, said his client was never a threat to the officers and said they should have never thrown her to the ground.
Plappert is hoping the lawsuit will encourage the LCSO and LPD to better train their officers on the street.
“I think they should have sensitivity training,” Plappert said. “You would think they would know that, ‘Hey, I have a topless woman or a nearly naked person, I need to do something to cover them up, to give them some dignity.’”
Attorneys for both departments refused to comment on the case. They have 30 days to respond to the lawsuit.

Little Miss loves Silly Monkey sandwiches and requested some in her Goodbyn Bynto for Thursday:
Her Silly Monkey sandwich is on Udi's Cinnamon Raisin bread, with SunButter, bananas, and honey. I decided to use my little round cutter to make them into cute sandwich bites.
Little Miss was the clever one that said the sandwiches looked like wheels... so the pinwheel picks were the perfect choice!
To quote her: "Wheels... pinwheels... get it, Mom?"
Got it! :)
Little Miss also has Chobani Champions Mixed Berry Greek Yogurt, a silicone cup of peach dices with a pink puppy fork pick.
In the top she has fresh cut carrot sticks and two of her Lucy's Maple Bliss cookies from our August Savorfull Box. Yum!
This is too weird! I made Monkey Bites today with crackers pb and bananas! haha Even used the "dirty monkey" picks :) I love how you did yours with bread! I think the girls would like that better than the crackers :)
LOL that's so funny! I make her a silly monkey sandwich every other week now haha it's her absolute favorite - always on cinnamon raisin bread now with sunbutter, banana, & honey. I just like to mix up the shapes/ style. ;)
And... I love eating the cinnamon raisin bread scraps. LOL
Beautifully simple! Bread scraps make for a happy mom 'round here, too! : ) Take care, Keeley!

Books
Flynn is the author of five collections of poetry: The Talking Drum, The Book of Monsters, The Lost Sea, The Golden Ratio, and Colony Collapse Disorder, and one collection of essays, The Rhythm Method, Razzmatazz and Memory: How To Make Your Poetry Swing.
Colony Collapse Disorder
Wings Press, 2013/ ISBN: 978-1-60940-294-5 Paperback $16
“The poems of Colony Collapse Disorder form a geopolitical abcedarium that lives up to Keith Flynn’s reputation as a seminal force in poetry . . . a voice for the dispossessed . . . with rock-gospel charisma and riddle-like revelations.” (Choice)

Praise for Colony Collapse Disorder
“Keith Flynn’s lyrical travelogue, a revolution of sound and story, celebrates the reader as witness. Not only are we transported to gorgeously-crafted locales, but we are rooted there by the poet’s unerring narrative, transforming each poem is a facet of light, an illuminative hallelujah. Scan the poetic landscape all you want–but you won’t find anything like this.”
—Patricia Smith, author of Blood Dazzler
 and today’s violent and chaotic news. Like the best music, Flynn’s poems bind us together with a shared sense of failure, challenge, joy and love.”
—Robert Morgan, author of Terrior

Poetry.
The Golden Ratio
Published by Iris Press, 2007 ‘Chang ‘flying barefoot through the lion’s gate,’ you might even imagine you are being dazzled not by the poet, but by the world itself.”
- William Pitt Root, White Boots: New and Collected Poems of the West
The Lost Sea
Published by Iris Press, 2000
ISBN: 0-916078-51-5 Paperback $13.00
Keith Flynn’s third collection of poems uses spectacular and musical language to address a wide range of crucial social, political and moral issues. These poems honor the visceral connection of the body and the physical world.. In The Lost Sea, language is cleansed of second-hand representations and once again acquires, like Henry Thoreau’s Concord bells, sacred presence to one and to any one inclined by soul to hear.”
Praise for The Lost Sea
“Full to brimming,” the poems of Keith Flynn’s dazzling new collection, The Lost Sea, give no quarter. The ebullient range of unruly references and the fabulously rich lexicon combine to stretch the limits of coherence into a compelling, original style, Here, “flesh and mud meditations,” narratives unfolding like petals, dramatic monologues and surreal juxtapositions run together just ahead of an exclamation mark. The poems are politically incisive and emotionally dramatic. They careen toward the reader with unlikely energy, with the music of a mind awake.”
- Forrest Gander
“Keith Flynn’s wide-ranging poetic vision often takes him beyond the pale of much contemporary American verse. The poems in The Lost Sea can take on such far-flung topics as surrealism, cinema, music, politics, and post-modernism and make them spin with energy and wit. There is humor and history and a large helping of erudition in these poems. Flynn is a provocateur with a tender heart who possesses the scholar’s respect for tradition and the artist’s hunger for innovation. His world is large and always interesting, and he journeys through it with great elan.”
- Kathryn Stripling Byer
The Book of Monsters
Published by Urthona Press, 1994
Second Edition by Animal Sounds Press, 1996
ISBN: 1-889276-01-4 Paperback $12.00
“We expect our poets to go on dangerous missions,” says Rob Neufeld, describing The Book of Monsters, “into realms of personal psychology and social reality, and return changed, bearing new music. The motive for the journey is the sense that something is terribly wrong in our lives. This is no easy task because there are plenty of folk who can advocate temperance and condemn the malcontent. The poet’s return to society, therefore, better bring with it something that glows with renewed faith or smacks of truth. In this amazing collection, Flynn finds redemption for a mad clatter of castaways, villains, lost lovers, and forgotten heroes.”
Praise for The Book of Monsters
“These poems remember, as Heidegger said, “the oldest of the old follows behind us in our thinking, and yet it comes to meet us.” Keith Flynn writes raging visceral poems, searching out the dark corners of feeling, of need and surrender, so as to make the heart and body one. He is an American Rimbaud, whose morality is stronger than the Academy’s or of the institutions which claim to govern us.”
- Jeffery Beam, author of The Fountain and Visions of Dame Kind
“Keith Flynn is dungareed griot, hinge-hipped healer, a world rover with a heart where his pen should be. He’s a blues growler, a soul surgeon, a lover of momentum, a hundred kiss for the ears. He is deft and delicate, fiery and unerring. In these pages, he sees through to the bones of lovers and warriors, strangers and fools. According to his gritty gospel, we are all the monsters. And with this book, he has given us language–jolting, tender, as dependable as pulse.”
- Patricia Smith, The Boston Globe
“In The Book of Monsters, Keith Flynn rides the wave of a ‘fearful equilibrium,’ celebrating all that is vivid, tender, and mysterious in our lives. He knows the “bright rainbow landscapes of the damned”–where the mind and spirit compete for dominion and where the wrenching potencies of contemporary life deepen their hold over selfhood. In these beautiful and often startling poems, Flynn brings us nearer to ourselves.”
- Charles Fishman, author of The Death Mazurka and The Firewalkers
The Talking Drum
Published by Metropolis Communications, 1991
Second Edition by Animal Sounds Press, 1996
ISBN: 1-889276-00-6 Paperback $12.00
Flynn’s first collection, published in Nashville, Tennessee in 1991, gathers poems from the first ten years of his literary career. From long poems to smaller bursts of lively and lyrical language, The Talking Drum foreshadows the stunning imagery and unique voice that are hallmarks of Keith Flynn’s later work. “Those who know contemporary poetry,” writes David Brendan Hopes, “will be amazed to find intelligence and passion in a rare conjunction. These poems attempt so much, so many points of view, so many outcroppings of verbal pyrotechnics, so many moments of hardwon empathy. These will be the very virtues cited by its admirers: inclusiveness, abundance, splendor of expression, understanding almost wholly without judgment, judgment almost wholly without malice. There is learning and immersion in the great tradition of American letters, but Flynn’s poems actually transform the world and its objects into personalities that are graceful, fallible, feminine, and most importantly, saved. It is a lucky break to have Flynn and his many talents among us.”

New Tam pattern is out for testing.For this hat, I used some of the gorgeous Black Trillium Lilt Sock that I picked up at our Pints and Purls gathering (see previous post).. Amazing color and gorgeous shine--I couldn't wait to get it onto my needles!
This is a great all-season, lightweight tam that comes together quickly and you can easily get two made from one skein. It might also be fun to incorporate a second color (any excuse to use more of Black Trillium's lovely yarn)!
Look for Black Trillium at Apples to Oranges Fine Yarn and Gifts, opening in June.

When people ask me why I became an atheist, the answer is always the same - I was born that way. The truth is I've never believed in a god, and it's only through television, my peers and the oddly cultural-relativistic public school system in Australia that I even came to know god. When I was 9 I changed schools where I was asked what religion I was, I said Christian because I went to scripture at my old school. At further pressing they asked me if I was catholic or Anglican, I didn't know the difference and said catholic. Needless to say my Mother got me out of that nutty cult room pretty quickly. When I was 12 and finally old enough to understand the question, I rejected the concept of God and have since been an outspoken atheist. So why am I mentioning this? Because my background matters when reviewing John W. Loftus' book Why I Became An Atheist: A Former Preacher Rejects Christianity.
It matters for me to make the case for my atheism because unlike a lot of people in western society, I was not brought up Christian. In scripture at school, we weren't taught from the bible, but were taught of the nature of God and the power of faith through parables. It wasn't a literal reading, it was very liberal, very much about selling a personal relationship with Jesus. So to read a book criticising fundamentalism is not even attacking the Christianity I know, to me it's attacking the extreme right who have no basis in reality to begin with.
To me, a criticism of biblical literacy should begin and end with science. We know the world is more than 6000 years old, we know that life evolved - both these facts have been known for more than 100 years now. Yet there are still those who take mythic storytelling and think of it as history? No wonder my scripture teachers focused on the power of belief instead of trying to warn me of the dangers of talking snakes. That to want a personal relationship with Christ is better than selling children on the dangers of Hell.
I have been an avid reader of Loftus' blog, Debunking Christianity, for some time now and find him to be a reasonable and level-headed man. Which is why the first thing that shocked me about the book was the way he would talk about what he used to believe, that it is so obviously absurd. And as I went on through the book, what stood out was how poor the intellectual reconciliation between the modern understanding of the world and the bible actually is. The reconciliations take an absurdity and make it sound even more absurd. To preserve the notion that the bible is the word (in some sense) of an omniscient deity, the most asinine explanations are presented. The book didn't even need Loftus' debunking those claims - they could not stand up on their own.
This is not to say I hated the book, Loftus is an excellent writer and wrote a mostly engaging argument. I say mostly engaging because I found the excessive quoting of scripture to be tedious. But then again, I keep getting scripture quoted at me so it must mean something to somebody - I'm really not the target audience for this. There were some parts that made the book worth getting - the outsider test for faith is possibly the best argument against religion, and that goes for all religion. The philosophy and explanation of the control beliefs was also really thorough and well presented. And finally at the end, the way he tackled the idea of ultimate meaning was done very well.
I was asked if I were to recommend an atheist book to theists, would it be this or Dawkins' book The God Delusion. I answered this book, and I do thoroughly recommend it. But at the same time I found Dawkins' book to be a lot more intellectually satisfying. It gave reasons to do away with superstition, this book attacked what is in my mind a straw-man of Christianity. But what I've fast come to realise over the last 5 years or so, what I perceive as a straw-man is the intellectual and moral foundations for hundreds of millions of people. Apparently some people still believe we are magic dirt who ate some bad fruit on the advice of a talking snake. Thankfully it's now the 21st century and J.K. Rowling has written a much better tale warning of the dangers of listening to talking snakes, and we don't even have to believe that there's a platform 9 3/4 at Kings Cross station to heed this advice.

I always chuckle at positive reviews for gibberish. I'm sorry to have to say that but, Dawkins was intellectually satisfying? Even Atheists who know a thing or two about the topic know his book to be rather poor. despite its reputation, it snot a Scientific condemnation of Religion, its just Dawkins making a fool of himself with ridiculous arguments that make no sense.
As to Loftus, his arguments are not really any better. Am I saying that all Christians make good and decent cases for heir beliefs? No. But neither do most Atheists I know. However, this doesn't mean Loftus's work really is that grand, and as you said its often an attack on Strawmen.
Lets look at the argument you found to be the most powerful, and inf act a good case against all Religion. The Outsiders test of Faith.
The trouble with the Outsiders Test is that it can be applied to Johns current religion as well as his past one. I realsie he's now an Atheist and the old clam that Ahtiests aren't' religious will come up, but I'll address that momentarily.
The Outsiders Test of Faith assumes that Atheists, like you and Loftus, do not have a Religion. Christians, like me, do. Our religion is silly and absurd but we stupid Christan don't relaise it. Meanwhile, we stupid Christians think Islam, and Hinduism, and Buddhism are silly. We hear what they believe, apply critical thinking and logic, and dismiss their claims of miracles and gods and demons. We simply refuse to look at our own Religion with the same critical eye.
Thus, Loftus's argument is that if we looked at our Religion as we do other peoples, n my case if I looked at Christianity form an outsiders perspective, I'd see it as just as silly as I see Buddhism or Hinduism or Islam.
then I'd be forced to conclude that all Religions are ultimately silly, and then I'd give up Religion and become an Atheist.
The main problems with this are in the fact that not all people form one religion see all other religions as utterly absurd. I know that, as a Christian, I don't find Islam completely absurd. I disagree with some of its tenets, but find it overall Reasonable in many of its theological aspects. (this is not to get into the strict adherence to certain forms of Islam, as that'd take too long.)
I also don't find Buddhism absolutely absurd, and find no real difficulty in seeing it as rational. Again, I disagree with pats of Buddhism, but I don't think Buddhism is in and of itself something silly. I have no difficulties in understanding why people believe in it.
And there is the first problem I have with his "Outsiders Test of Faith". It rests entirely upon the idea that I should find everyone else's Religion as silly and absurd and should laugh that people believe that nonsense. As I don't find every Religion on earth except mine as nonsense, though, I have to wonder why John would assume I'd find my own absurd and silly and unbelievable should I look at it form the outside.
In fact, I have looked are it from the outside and still find it reasonable. To John, this means I didn't really set aside my Christianity and look at it because, as with Dawkins, he assumes that if one doesn't arrive at the "Correct" conclusion, the one he has set out for us to arrive at, then we must not have properly examined our Religion critically.
Which brings me to the next spot of trouble i see in Loftus's idea. What about his Religion?
Despite claiming to be Non-Religious, Loftus does have a system of beliefs that one can say are analogous to Religion. He isn't JUST an Atheist, he has beliefs about the origin and nature of our world, and how that world operates. he has a systematic belief about how we exist and why, and where moral codes come from. He has a basic system of beliefs that enable him to relate to his world, and to interpret it in a way he can understand it.
And this is all Religion actually is. Religion isn't about belief in gods, if it where then Atheistic Religions like Zen Buddhism wouldn't be Religions. Religion isn't always about a higher power, or involve Supernatural events. All Religion is, in the end, is a Philosophical outlook on life. A Religion is just a worldview.
Everyone has a Religion, and this includes John Loftus, and you.
I realise those who are Atheistic these days do not like me saying this and will disagree vehemently, as The word has been given a lot of Negative Baggage by those who have dedicated their lives to criticism of Christianity, and belief in God generally, but its still true.
One shoudln't confuse "Religion" with "Theism", nor shoudl we assume Religion is a seperate thing that operates fundamentlaly differently than other forms of thought. Dawkins Mind Virus idiocy is just that, idiocy. All a Religion is is the way peopel see the world.
And this brigns me to my point. Wy can't we apply the Outsiders Test of Faith to John Loftus's claims?
Are we really to beleive that if we apply te Outsiders Test of Faith, we will all be atheists becaus we relaise all Relgiiosn are silly andhtus be exactly like John? Why can't we see Johns Ideas form the outside and fidn them absurd and ridiculous?
The claim that they can't be seen that way because he's not advocating anything, as he has no Religion to offer, is just foolish. Its clear he wants us to take on certain positive beliefs about things, and from an outsiders perspective those things should look just as silly and absurd as anything else in any other Religion.
Of course you can also fall back on the idea that Johns beliefs are rooted in Logic and Reason, whereas Religion is rooted in Faith, which by definition is believing something even though you have no evidence.
Which is precisely why the New Atheism increases intellectual malaise.
Faith isn't actually belief without evidence. The word Faith actually means that one has confidence in a proposition, or loyalty to it. It is a synonym for trust.
Faith can actually emerge from knoweldge, and knowledge can increase Faith. Even though Jesse "The Body" Ventura said that if you knew you'd not need faith, and despite the "Brilliant" ,men like Harris and Dawkins et all saying Faith is beleif without evidence and hrus irrarional, its simply not true to see Faith as beleif without evidence. Certainly none of he Christian Thinkers odf old who are welle steemed did. Nor did the Jewish Rabbinical Tradition hold this position. I can find nothign in Ha-Islam that does.
Its eally just a Caracature.
Its also silly to beleive Reason leads automaticlaly to Atheism, and that Atheism is always linked ot a certian view on the owrd thats in line with modern Humanism.
One can be reaosnable and arrive at THeism. One can be an outsder and ocnvert to Christianity, as many have. One can apply the Outsiders Test of Faith and still end up beleivign what oen did before. And One canbe an Athiest and belifve radiclaly differenlty than John Loftus.
I can't fathom why peopel think this is a grand arugment. It sliek the Ultimate 747 of Dawkns, or the endless misquotation of the US Fnding Fathers, its a sueless argument.
It doenst even ask if these beleifs are true, it just asks us to ebelvie all Relgiiosu epoepl see all other relogiosn as silly but their ownand asusmes they'd see their own as silly if they saw it omr the outside, and asusmes Johns Ateism is not a Religion in and of itself and is the natural conclusion to rejectign the silliness of Religion.
COme now, thats not trelaly intellectually developed thinking.
And sorry fo the multiple posts, but I didnt realsie the world limit until after Id written this, and didnt wantot just erare the whoel thing.
I'm also Dysleic, and dint spell check the full of this.
Thanks for the multitude of comments, I'll try over time to respond to them all.
Dawkins book is a good polemic against superstitious thought, against a liberal point of view that religion is something that deserves protection. In that he achieved success, it was similar to what Sam Harris wrote in The End OF Faith. If anyone was looking for a sophisticated argument against religion, then reading the likes of Dawkins, Harris or Hitchens is not the way to go. Like I said, I wouldn't recommend Dawkins' book to theists.
Whether atheists can make a decent case for their beliefs (well lack of belief which is all atheism is - just like someone who doesn't believe that the stars carry celestial messages for our species) is irrelevant. Atheism is the position that there isn't enough evidence to believe in a higher power, the burden is on any religious person to demonstrate their beliefs. If there's no credible evidence for believing in a higher power, then why believe at all?
As for the Outsider Test For Faith, just look at Christianity. The core of the Christian doctrine for over 1600 years has involved the trinity. That God is simultaenously one form and three forms. It is logically impossible. 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 is absurd. The whole concept of Jesus being God-incarnate is absurd. And this is just one example. If you think that Christianity passes the outsider test for faith, please demonstrate so.
[more tonight]
Kel, your makign the same errors I noted before. You make this a debate between Religious people and Atheists. Actually, though, one can be religious and an Atheist. And I've said before, I've never met a Non-Religious person. Religion isn't beleif int he SUpernatural (As John now wants us to beelive, and has posted on over at DC) its simply a Phiilosophy one beelives in.
That said, Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens et all don't make a good case agaisnt Superstition beignprotected. For one thing,the very fact that you employ the word Superstition to apply to Religion, and seem to limit Religion to Theism, indicates that it actulaly does the oposite.
Dawkins basically advvocates that we unthinkignly reject Religion, which he also narrowly defines, and attack it mercilessly. Rather than simply arguing that we should allow critisism of Religion, he aruges that it ought ot be mocked until it becoems socially unacceptable and everyone becoems sensable and logical, which in Dawkisn mind means that everyone shoudl think just like him. You se, one cannot be intelegent and rational and disagree with Dawkins...
Its that sort of arrogance that prevents me from taking his words seriosuly and that are rather obviously employed by his Drones, and htis seems to include you, sadly.
Considering that Religious beleifs, particulalry Christianity, have already been subject to endless critisism over the last 200 years, Dawkins isn't even saying anythign new or bold. He just oretnds that soemhow he's breakign a Taboo, and that he's challenign society to finally look at Religion criticlaly. He's hwoever writtign in a time when Athiests have high level jobs in Parliment (We'll see hw many remain after the current scandal ends) have no toruble findign work in Universities and seem to not be bothere din life. He live sin a time when the BBC mocks Christianty in telvision comedies and in which Documentaries are released about "The real origins of CHristianity" in even America.
Yet you want to sit here with a straight face tellign me his messaege is that we shoudln't make religion soemthign hat can't be critisised? Thats nonsense, its already critiissed. Dawkisn is a moral and intllectual coward who simply sees it as a weakenign force and wants to pounce while its down.
As to the Outsiders Test of Faith, I fear you havent rea dmy words on it, but as I've said, I don't actually find all Religious beelifs form every other Religion in th world ridiculous, so I dont think Johns logic is solid. I also don't think I shoudl accept his Religion just because he says it snot a Relgiion. Why shoudl I asusme that Atheism is true because all the worlds religiosn are silly? WHy shoudkl we asusme that Johns beleifs are osmehow soimplety a "Lack of beelifs" and tht I'd be just liek him if I follow htis test? Are you really goign to tell me that his views aren't really vieews and cant be critisised?
Also, do learn soething about the Trinity. When you say its been in Christendom for 1600 years, you seem to beleive the runnish that it was cfreated at Nicea. Dan Brown history is not real History. And the Trinity actulaly does make sense. Its not 1+1+1=1, and no matte rhow cute the sterotype, usign a catchprhase wont do.
The Trinity actulaly teaches they are three persons withone essence, not three distinct and compeltley seperate beigns who if you add them up equel one being.
Its rathe rlike a Science Ficiton show in which three bodies ar eoperated by a single mind.
Thats an analogy and not perfect, btu it gives you a better idea. Rather than the Trinity beign undertsood as three seperat ebeigns but oen God, its understood as one beign divided into three parts.
And I have given it thought, which is another sterotype we can do without.
What a broad definition of religion, so broad that the term becomes absolutely useless.
From wikipedia:
A religion is an organized approach to human spirituality which usually encompasses a set of narratives, symbols, beliefs and practices, often with a supernatural or transcendent quality, that give meaning to the practitioner's experiences of life through reference to a higher power or truth.From the dictionary:
a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, esp. when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.If you are going to define religion is such nebulous terms, then there is no point in using the word. It means nothing and distracts from actually having a point. So please, use a definition of religion that is at least allows for one to make a point.
Oh, and atheism is not a religion. It's simply the lack of belief in God. It's like calling not collecting stamps a hobby. Like calling starvation a meal. Like calling bald a hair colour. Again, please work in terms that actually are useful and relevant, otherwise you can't properly communicate.
Also, if you have some problem with John W Loftus' philosophical position, please take it up with him. I'm not here to defend anyone's philosophical position but my own. This blog is called Kelosophy for a reason - it's about how I see the world. If you have problems with my arguments, bring them up. But I'm not here to defend Loftus, Hitchens, Dawkins, Harris or anyone else for that matter.
So if you have a problem with arguments I've presented, go ahead and argue against them. I ask that you do so in a constructive manner, that is communicate in such a way that will allow for the facilitation of information exchange. i.e. use terms as close as possible to definitions that are part of the lexicon, it's important for communication.
As for your outsider test for faith, remember what the challenge is calling for - an outsider perspective. What does your religion look like to an outsider? It's not whether you can justify the beliefs as an insider, but what they would look like if you were explaining them to an alien who had never come across religion before. How would you explain your beliefs to someone who is well educated on how the universe works? How would you explain your beliefs to someone who doesn't know how the universe works, but has at his disposal a baloney detection kit? Does Christianity pass this test? I would say not anymore than any other world religion.
Kel, your not really reaidng what I said, so Ill put it in Bullet format.
1: If you dont want me to make commentary on Dawkins, then downt mention him yourself. If your goign to prais ehim and his views, then you invite critiissm of the same. The same holds for Loftus and anyoen else you think had ideas that are good and want to present.
2: I get a lot of the itme that peoel say my deifnition is so broad it includes anythign and the deifnition is worhtless. However, my deifnition of Religion isnt that broad, it just doens't preclude Athwistic Philosophies. My deifnition is also what Socilogists see Religion as. Even Wikipedia, which is a bad soruce, mentions Religion as notoriosuly difficult to define.
Religion is just how youy see the world, a Philosophicla framework, and you certianly have htis.
3: Theism isn't a Religion.
I didnt say Ahtiesm was a Relgiion, but neither is THeism. Beleiving a god exists is not a Relgiion, but beleif in a gods existance can be a part of, even central to, a Religion. Atheism, in the same ay, cna be a part of, even central to, a Relgion.
As much as Athiesm is not a Religion in and of itself, it is still a part of a religious suystem when incoeproated into a Philosophy about how life works, which is all Religion is.
4: You also misse dmy point. The POutsiders Test of Faith doens't work because I have looked at it form the outsiders point of view and dotn find Christaintiy that unreasonable.
Just like I dont find all other Religiosn to be unreasonable either.
The "Baloney Detection Kit" may be a relalyneat thign picke dup from Sagan, but it doens't really work in this instance since you cna't relaly sow why I woudl think Christainity is Baloney if I was an outsider.
Many peopel dont think its all that irrational to be a Christian, even if they themselves aren't.
1. Have you even asked me what I liked about Dawkins book? No, I just mentioned the name so you went off on a tangent.
2. Pray-tell, what are atheist philosophies? Atheism is the not-theism. It is nothing more than the lack of belief in god. What that includes, it could be anything but using a supernatural explantion. See my most recent post non-astrologer if you disagree.
Wikipedia is a fine source for most things, I wouldn't use it as a source when doing a university paper but for general knowledge it represents a good starting point. I used it out of convenience..
4. If you think many religions pass the outsider test for faith, then so be it. Again, I do not think it passes the outsider test for faith, that there are too many things in the religion that make no sense at all. Start with the concept of God and then stem to pretty much everything that makes Christianity Christianity.
You've made 8 posts on here now, but have you even once asked what my philosophy is? You said earlier:
"Everyone has a Religion, and this includes John Loftus, and you."
So what is my religion? Come on, please tell me what religion I am. I'd be curious to know. But please pull a definition of religon that makes it distinguishable from worldview and from individual beliefs. Otherwise if religion is going to be synonymous with worldview, why use the word at all?
Also, is it too much to ask for a spell checker? Firefox has one built in.
Kel, I never said I coudl tell you what your Religion was, only htat you have one. Thats because Religion isn't beleif in gods, or supernaturlaism. Religion is just a worldview one holds to, that tells one how the world works and oens role in it.
Everyone has that.
Now to the rest.
1. Have you even asked me what I liked about Dawkins book? No, I just mentioned the name so you went off on a tangent.My Tanent ties into the reat of the asusptions, such as Faith beign beleif without evidence or Atheists lacjing Religion, and yoyur praise of Dawkisn book was more than enough to tell me that you tacetly agreed with most of his premise.
Are you to tell me Im fully wrong here?
2. Pray-tell, what are atheist philosophies? Philosophies that are inheranlty Athistic, and that describe the state of the universe in terms of Ateism.
Exampels include all forms of Secular Humanism, which itsel fincludes SOviet OCmmunism.
Neitche was also foudner of an Athiestic Philosophy, so was Sartre.
So don't pretend this is impossible.
Atheism is the not-theism. It is nothing more than the lack of belief in god.But just saying thats what Atheism is doens't preclude the existance of Philosophies that incrproate Ateism, or ar ebased aroudn it, does it? You ac as if Atheistic Philosophies ar eipossible simply because Atiesm is a rejection fo theism.
If thats so, then Theistic Philosophies are equelly imposisble, and CHristainiy isnt theistic.
Its just daft.
What that includes, it could be anything but using a supernatural explantion. See my most recent post non-astrologer if you disagree.Your post abotu "Non-Astrolegers" doens't relaly addres shwat Im dsaying. Im not saygn Athiem is in and of itself a Philosophy any mro ehtan Im sayign its in and of itself a Religion. Im sayign that Relgiion is philosophy and there are Philosophies rooted in Ahtism.
There is a signifigant difference.
I dont knwo why you find this IMPOSISBLE to fathom,. but there are Philosophies whose core assumptiosn include Atheism.
They are Athisgic Philosophies.
As much as Ahtiesm alone isnt a Philosophy, it still serves as a componant of,and often the core componnat of, many Philosophies ont he market.
Wikipedia is a fine source for most things, I wouldn't use it as a source when doing a university paper but for general knowledge it represents a good starting point. I used it out of convenience.no, Wikipedia oftnegets its facts wrong. But Im not here ot discuss it. It doesnt matter as Wikipedia agreed wiht me that Relgion is not limited to Theistic beelifs or SUpernaturlaism.
It just proved my point. I just dotn use it out of principle..Which is the same for Athisstic Philosophies. Spare me the tommyrot that Ahtiesm is just non-theism and the bit abotu non-astrologiers, you know full well by now I mean Philosophies groudned in Atheism as a foundatiinal assumption.
Those Philosopheius are themselves Relgiions, which in turn demonstrate why I say Atheistss have a Religion even if atheism itslef is not a Religion.
Its not that complicaed.
4. If you think many religions pass the outsider test for faith, then so be it. Again, I do not think it passes the outsider test for faith, that there are too many things in the religion that make no sense at all.But this may be because of where you are strgin from.? Hiding behidn the dodge that yours is rellay nonbeleif wont work.
Start with the concept of God and then stem to pretty much everything that makes Christianity Christianity.I have, but non of its irraitonal nonsense. Thats the point. Have you never read Des Carte?)?
Anyone relying on this book is going to have a superficial view of the arguments no matter which side you are on.
I am suprised at all the praise and recommendations heaped on it by people like Geisler...it may be that he is actually setting Loftus up.
Thats because Religion isn't beleif in gods, or supernaturlaism. Religion is just a worldview one holds to, that tells one how the world works and oens role in it.And I still contend that if religion and worldview are synonymous then there is no point in having two words. That religion is distinguished from worldview by many factors and this can be seen in the way the media, the general population and in academic circles the world is used. Everyone has a worldview, not everyone has a religion.
Are you to tell me Im fully wrong here?
I'm telling you that your criticisms of Dawkins were completely misguided. As you probably have established by now, I don't care about religion. I know, there's the r word again that you are so desperately trying to say "is just a worldview." When there is debate within academic circles about whether Buddhism is a religion, why aren't you there to solve the problem? After all, being a Democrat or an Environmentalist is a religion by your definition. You don't know what I got out of that book and why I liked it, and the criticisms you made of the book suggest that you don't have psychic powers or access to an omniscient deity because you got it completely wrong.
So don't pretend this is impossible.Are there philosophies that have non-belief in them? Of course. But again, I feel you are defining terms here. Communism and humanism are inherently atheistic, but I would argue that there are not atheist philosophies. If you are going to call communism an atheist philosophy, why not capitalism? After all, the only god in capitalism is money. It says nothing of the supernatural - it only dictates behaviour between natural agents.
Spare me the tommyrot that Ahtiesm is just non-theism and the bit abotu non-astrologiers, you know full well by now I mean Philosophies groudned in Atheism as a foundatiinal assumption.I disagree. Atheism is non-theism, that's all atheism is. This is why Sam Harris argues that the word shouldn't exist.?Again, please stop using the word religion that way. I don't come from a preconception that there is no higher power. I just haven't seen anything that actually demonstrates that there is a higher power. Again, I refer to the non-astrologer post. How I came to be an atheist was I was born. I didn't have any beliefs then (as beliefs are acquired) and I now have beliefs that say that God is a silly concept, all supernatural is. So why do I say this?.
So would I call my belief in science a faith? I would not for two reasons. Science works in uncertainty, seeks to improve and change where it is lacking in explanation. Secondly, we can see that science works every second of every hour of every day. This computer I'm sitting on can do more calculations per second than the entire human population combined. Recently I flew halfway around the world on a small piece of flying metal. I have meat sitting in a deep freezer that I bought months ago.
I don't have to pray to the god of electromagnetism in order for my computer to turn on. When there is a source of electricity coming into my house, then the computer will turn on at the touch of a button. When I turn on a tap and have running water, I know that if it comes out at water then it will stay as water, no matter how much I wish it would turn to wine.
My worldview is that the universe is governed by a series of forces, blind forces that have all permutations of mankind in the universe. Radioactive substances will decay at a constant rate, non-radioactive substances will hold their form unless subject to nucleosysthesis like that in a star. The mind is a product of the body, that one needs a body in order to have a mind.
Of course, all these points can be falsified. If my water were to miraculously turn into vodka, or that the lead in the house were miraculously able to turn into gold, or even if we could show that the mind and body are separate, I would say that my worldview is falsified. And given that every religion (in the classical use of the word) has these kinds of miracles in them - it is only in our knowledge of how the world actually works that such challenges may seem unfair. But hey, if God can cook a sacrificial bull through the power of prayer...)?Yeah, it's superficial. It has to be, you aren't going to get a book like that which tries to tackle everything and not have it be somewhat abbreviated.
Where I found it lacking was when he was trying to describe the age of the universe. To me fundamental christianity is falsified the minute they talk about creationism or a young earth / universe. Why? because the plethora of evidence suggests that live evolved, the earth is around 4.55 billion years old and the universe is somewhere between 13 and 15 billion years old. It doesn't matter what the bible says because the bible is so obviously wrong when it comes to describing our "creation."
Though when he was covering the different points of view, what stood out for me was how absurd the arguments were. The arguments trying to reconcile genesis with modern scientific findings were especially absurd. It may be superficial, but just look at the arguments that are being presented as reconciliation. So many have a very superficial understanding of science or the natural world at their core - if it had any grounding in reality at all. It was absurdity after absurdity, which to me suggested that Christianity should just cut it's losses and focus on the J-man instead of arguing by genesis..
Yo u think that through Sicnece we have ganed an undertsndign of Reality and made God obsolete, so thus Sicnece has killed Religion. But as I noted elsewhere, Religion is not the same hting as theism, nor does one have to be THeistic to be Religious.
This is the toruble iwht Athiest sliek you. You soemhow conflate terms, and htink you are intellegent for doing so.
In fact, you now want to claim that there is a debate in Academia over rather or not Buddhism is a Religion. There isn't. Everyoen agrees that it is. Buddhists even admit Buddhism is a Religion. If you study Buddhism in Univesity they will tell you its a Religion. The only lace I've seen Buddhism described as not a Reliigion is on the Internet, where the previalign attitude is that Buddhism is this cool philosohy abotu us gettign alogn and stuff, and thus is way better thsn CHristianity, and becauase we odnt have a problem with it it must not really be a Religion.
But most of the peopel who think that way also have littel to no undertsnaing of Buddhism.
Those wo do undertsand it know it is a Religion. Rather or not you wan tto admit this painful reality is irrelevant. Buddhism is a Religion and there really is no debat eon it.
Just liek Religion isnt theism, despite your unnessisary and erroneous claims.
By the way, many Sicnetists are Theistic, so if THeism has been discredite dby Sicnece, how do you explain them? If you borrow the Dawkisn or Harris modle and saythe are ocmpartmentalising, then I'd ask you the samehtign I ask all Dawkisn CDrones, how do you know?
You seem to be parrotign another Religiosu tenet, that beleif in God existed onky to epxplain the unknowable and we dont need God ow because of Sicnece. But, since many peopel beliv in Both Sicnece and Gods existance, your enture premise is false.
Especially since God sint used in most gheologies to elain rianstorms or grass growing.
By the way, thats only one of the irraitonal things you've said.
Heres another.
"And I still contend that if religion and worldview are synonymous then there is no point in having two words."
Is this even an argument? There are pelnty of word sin English that are identical in meanign to other words. Take a look at the English word "Sea", for example.
Di you knwo that the word "Sea" and the word "Ocean" mean the same thing?
Well, what if I told you they didnt mean the same thing, and contended the Ocean andthe Sea where different? Woudl you beleiv me? Woudl you beleive me if I used the same logic you used on why a Religion and a worldview aren the same? Woudl you beleive me if I said that we'd not need two words for the same hting, so thus the Ocean and the Sea cant be the same?
Of coruse you lciam that Religion and Worldview are sperate dby "Many factors" , but so far, you havent listed any. THeoly thing you seem to have done is to conflate Religion wth THeism when you said Sicnece had kileld Religion ebcause God is obsolete nwo that we have explanatiosn fofor Natural Phoenomenon, which prive snly that you have a poor grasp of what Religion is, and try to force it to mean Theism.
You also use the tired old bro,mide that my deifnition of Relgiion (WHich someone peopel think actulaly is mien as if I invented it) means that beign a Democrat or an Environe,mntalist is a Religion. Actually, no they arne't. The reaosn is because they dont invovle any real metaphysical assessemnt about how the world works. BEign a Democrat is beign afifliated with a Political party, which thus has a platofrm for social order, unelss by Democrat you mean "One who advocates Democracy', and even then you are confornted wiht the fac thtat this is soley political. Its not a worldview ina nd of itself, as it foesnt tell you hwo the world works and yor relationship to it.
Beign an NEnvironemtnalist is also not a Religion becuase it snot a worldview inand of itself for the sme reaosns. Beign an environemtnalist means only that you htink we shoudl protect the Environmnt, it doesnt supply meanign and value to the Environemnt, or determien your rolwe in it, or relationship to it. \
Both Environmentalism and Democratic leanings are contengent on worldivew, but are nto themselves worldviews.
So, no, they arne't Religiosn acpcrdign to what Ive said Religiosn are.
But Humanism is, becaue unlike Environemtnalism or beign a Democrat, Humanism includes a dicussion about the role of Humanity in their environemnt and provides a way to unerstand hwo the world came abotu and works,a nd as a basis for unerstandign our relationship to the rest of the world arudn us.
Im sorry that you dont see the difference, btu then you htink sagn things like "Non-Astorlogiers " makes sense.
Also, COmmunism, as understood by the Marxist varitety, acutlaly shoudln't be distinguished form Hmansim liek you did, when you said "Communism and Humanism". THe COmmunists actulaly viewed hemselves as Hmanists,a nd if you read SOviet Literature, its cler they acutlly where Humanists.
But to go furhter and clai Capitolism an Ahtisstic Philosophy you make yourself sound even more out of touch with what Im saying. Communism is an Ahttsoc Philosohy because it makes a positive assertion that no god exists. Read Marx. Read Lennin. Read Stalin. They go out of their ay to make this painfully obvious. The way the Soviet is to udnertand the word is by following Hmanist and naturlaistic principles. The SOviet Union, in fact, had soemthign called Ideological correctness, in which all idea had to conform to the Ideology of IDialetic Mateiralism.
Communism wa sinherantly Ahtistic, and htis cant be reaosnabley argued.
But to argue that capitalism is an Ahtistic philosophy, even though no Capitolist writer links Capitolism with Ahtiesm, which includes an Atheist like Ayn Rand who was herslef a Capitolist, then you have no basis for the claim.
Unless Capitolism explicirly denies the eixstance of a god, or unless you have to be Athistic in order to follwo Capitolism, it snot an Ahtitsic Philsophy. TO be a Soviet you had to be an Athiest. To be a Captilosy you simply have to say that the aquisition of profit form a free maket economy is the best way to run an economy.
As to your claim of beign Born an Ahtisst and how all supernaturalclaism are islly, you seem to havenot rlaly studied the topic. Not everyoeneven sees God as Supernatural.
And no oen is Born an Athist, this much is priven, btu veen if you whre, it means nothing ot what Im sayignhre Given that your Non-Astorlager post misses what we've been sayign who disagree, Ill repeat it.
I nevr said Atheism ina nd of itself was a Relgiion, but no Ahtist is just an Ahtiest, and their Atheism is simply a componant of the overall worldivew they hodl to. The worldivewin totlal is a Religion.
Its not that difficult.
And this is why I cant stop usign the word Relgiion the way I do. Yoru Religious beelfis tell you no god exists, which is a positive assertion, even if you dney it. Your Religion also informs your views on everyhtign else,beign a naturlaist, for example.
This sint limied ot just the proposition of a gods existance, btu everythgin else thta connects to that.
Butthen, how edicsted can you be when you write htis...
."I know it spopular to think of God as a Placeholder like you did, as an explanaiton for those unknowns that SIcnece nwo tels us ar enatural phoenomenon, but consierign that an awful lot of THeology agrees that htose are Nstural Phoenomenon, and thta thelogy gos back much farthet than Sicnece tellign us this, your case is base don an ignorant preusmptin that God was created to epxlzin the unknown. You have no acutal proof that God was cfeate dby primitive tribes to explain earthwuakes and thunderstorms, do you?
COnsiderign that Modern Sicnece emrged from Christianity, because CHristaisn thoguth that the Natual world ioperate don natural laws established by Gid, your case is moot. THe Early Christaisn didnt think God direclty caused thunderstorms until they discovered the truth. THeydidnt htink Gay se xin Egypt caused Earhtwuakes. They always beleived those thign shad natural epxlanations..
But the Irony is, by claimign Gid was just a palceholder invented by tribes to explain pheoneomenon, you move beyidn "Non-Theism" in that you siply se no evidence to makign a positive assertion thatGod doesnt actually exist, and was just invente dby Primitive man to epxlain the unknown. How is htis reconcilable to your ealrier claims of it jus being "I see no evidence"? You lcelary have a positive view htat God doest exist, and a positive viw to accoutn for why peepl beeliv ein GOd, which invaidates your other cliams that you dont have such.
Incidentllay yournot bign very Sicnetific sicne youbeleive God was just a palceholder for htos htings, and say this as if its a proven fact.
You dotn beeliv ein Sicnece, you be,eive in the Religion of Humanism, which you beleiv ein withotu any evidence at all. You just hide behidn Sicnece..
Its not a worldview ina nd of itself, as it foesnt tell you hwo the world works and yor relationship to?
In fact, you now want to claim that there is a debate in Academia over rather or not Buddhism is a Religion. There isn't. Everyoen agrees that it is.Everyone? That's being a bit presumptuous. I've had a student studying religion chastise me for me calling Buddhism a religion.
While I appreciate your input, it's really hard to read your posts when there are so many spelling errors. I'm having to put more effort into decoding you than what you write. Please get a spell checker, I understand that you are dyslexic but surely you can appreciate the value of proper communication and having a little red line highlighting mistakes surely could aid you towards that..Sure I do. Read Genesis, tell me that the creation story was anything more than a tribe who didn't understand trying to make sense of the world.
It's not comforting for me to say that, it's what I've derived from reading holy books and talking to believers. God is a god of the gaps, if you think this is incorrect then demonstrate that God exists through experiment rather than as an explanation for the unknown. Come on, show that God is anything more than a placeholder for the absence of information. Surely you can demonstrate this.
It's got to the stage now where I think this is as far as we can go. I'm not going to accept your definition for religion - it seems that you are calling religion a worldview and I don't even know why. Why do you need to say I have a religion? What does it do? Does it make any of my arguments any more or less valid? I think not, it's a label and nothing more.
What interests me is whether you can demonstrate God's existence. If you can't then I have no reason for believing and will remain an atheist. If you can, then great. But please don't try to play a game of trip up the atheist, I'm not interesting in playing wordgames - especially when you are defining words for your own convenience.
If you want to argue against any point I made, I have over 100 posts on here on various topics. If you can show me where my logic is wrong, then go ahead. But trying to play wordgames is not going to get you anywhere, especially when I have to decode your dyslexic output. The fact is, while you give definitions that are contrary to how I see the words used, then you aren't going to change my mind. Argue the core of the argument, don't get hung up on whether God can be supernatural or not. Don't get hung up on whether I have a religion or not. Argue the points, not the semantics.
kEL-.except I didnt equicvocate Science with religion, you did.
THink about it for a minuet.
You have claimed here that Religion came into existance because we needed an explanation for natural phoenomenon. Humanity seeks ot have an undertanding of why things work, and Religion was created t fill the gap. If this is true, and if you are correct, then Science must be a Religion as it too exosts to fill in our understanding of hwo the world works.
If all Religion existed for was to tell us how natural phoenomenon arose and how our world functioned, and if our old Religious beelifs have been superceded by Science, which offers us a better, mroe elaborate undersxtanding based on the Scientific Method, then Science has simply served as our new Religion, because it fulfills the same function that Religion serves.
That is, if Religion relaly is all about tellign us why THunderstorms happen and why Earthquakes occur.
In what way is Science not a Religion, under this claim?
You may say it snto a Religion becuae its not theistic, but I'll remidn you that Theism is not a synonym for Religion, even though you seem to think it is. Religion is also not "Faith based" as Harris and Dakins misdefine the word. And accordign to you, its all abotu explainign our world.
So, since Science explains our world, it is a Religion.
Incidentlaly, my actual point was that you made a Religiosu statement about Religion when you claimed it was obsolete, and thenprocceeded to claim that we can know htings through sicnece. THis is ultimaltey a Philosophical ideology, and thus a Religious stat?I didn't take individuality away, nor do I even udnerstand how defining Religion as worldview acutlaly removed Individuality.
Incidentllay, you haven't hsown how my deifnition of Relgiion Fails by sayign your worldview is shaped by many thigns and incliding Secular Ethics and politics and suchlike.
Since Religion is actually just how we see the world aroudn us, and since you certianly have a philosophical framework form which you interpet the world, you are Religious. THis doens't impede your individuality, it merley means that your philosophical framework which defines the way you understand your world funcitons int he same way my Religion does to me, and thus I see no real difference in the Mechanism, andno need ot make a distinction.
It doenst prevent us form seeign the world differnetly or possessing radiclaly different personalities, it just means mine isnt "Religion' while yours is "NonReligion". They ar eboth the same thing, as they are both Philosophical modles we use to understand the world aroudn us.
In what way are they different outside of spacific teachings?
Everyone? That's being a bit presumptuous. I've had a student studying religion chastise me for me calling Buddhism a religion.I feel sorry for said student then.
It is a Religion.
Sure I do. Read Genesis, tell me that the creation story was anything more than a tribe who didn't understand trying to make sense of the world.You mean, read the openign two chapters of Genesis. I doubt you mean read the ortiosn about Abraham.
And, I dont get that at all from Genesis.
Much less do I get it for the enture concept of God in total.
Why shoudl I htink God was create dby primitive tribes as a catchall explanation for all phoenomenon? What actual proof do you have of that spacific claim?
Last night th log woudlnt allow me to post.
But I did want to say that Im not surprised that you dont understand why I'd see you as Religious. I wlltell you its not because I think it invalidates your arguments. In fact, since I am religious, how would you beong religious make your cliams less true. However, it wouldprevent you from seeing my claims as untrue because they are religious.
But the reason is really more simple than this. Its because when you stop and htink about what Religion is, you realise its just what people htink of as true. I don't beleive in God in a mystical sense, but in an actual sense. I think God actually exists, just like rocks, or trees, or other people. When I think of the moral and ethicla onsiderations from Christianity, I think of them in terms of rpactical, livable morls and ethics based upon and applicable to dialy life.
In this way I can see no difference between my approahc ot my religion and yoru approach to what you think is a nonreligious philosophy. I see no difference betwee how my religion functiosn in my life and how your nonreligious philosophy functins.
I see, functionally, no difference between the two, and have to wonder why mine is religious and yirus not.
I'd say yurs is also a religion, as it does the same htigns mien does, and is that really too hard to understand?
Give it up Zarove. I'm not going to suddenly use your definition of religion, I'm not going to respond to straw-man arguments against my position and I'm not going to try to decode your badly-typed English. If you can't type without making spelling mistakes, and if you can't argue without using your own definitions, then don't bother at all. I won't respond.
Kel, Im dyslexicx.
That said, your an intellectual coward. MYou act like my deifnition of Religion is osme unique, private one, when in fact its from Sociology textbooks.
The problem with you is that you want Religion to be a sperrate hting from Athiesm, to the poitn where no Atheist can be undertsood ot be Religious. You thus ignore anythign that contradicts your views.
My "Straw man arugments" arne't straw men at all.
I still say you cna't rellay tell me why a Religion is not the same thing as a worldview. You have decreed that a worldview is not a Religion, but you supplied no reason why its not.
And, from where I sit, there is no difference. Why shoudl I see one set of beelifs about how the word works as a Religion, whislt another set of beelifs bout how the world worlks as not religion?
WHat is the difference, exaclty?
If my arugnenrs are all strawmen, then by all means tell us what make sosmehtign a religion, and why it precludes you, and other Atiests.
I'll wait.
Though I suspect you wont answr this, because its easier to sya my arugments are stramen and filled with logical fallacies and Im just plain wrong wihtitu offeirng any logical reaosn.
After all, you want Relgiion to be SUperstituious myth repsnsible for all the bad in the world, and surly your not Religiosu because your reasonable and intellegent et all.
( And this is meant as an exageration.)
I'm sorry Kel, but just declarign me wrong and logicllay flawed fdoesnt mean I am.
This is the last time...
When I use a word in a context, you respond to MY context - otherwise you build a strawman of your opponents arguments. By using your definition of religion against the usage in which I used the word, you misrepresented what I was saying. Is that so hard to comprehend?
And as for wanting to blame religion for all the evil? Again you are misrepresenting my position and arguments. Hardly surprising after you tried to tie one criticism of religious belief (my usage of the word religion) to an emotional appeal by me. Again you don't argue by misrepresenting your opponent - all you are doing is creating a straw-man by doing so.
The difference between one set of beliefs and another is the way they are transmitted. What we call religion is very much a social construct, the difference is that anyone can be an atheist for whatever reason (see non-astrologer) but to be a Christian it requires memetic transfer. If you think I'm wrong, show me someone who came to believe that Jesus is God without ever hearing the word of the gospels.
I'm sorry Kel, but just declarign me wrong and logicllay flawed fdoesnt mean I am.Do you want me to go through all your posts one by one and show where you
a) used your own definition of a word to call an argument with my definition absurd?
b) where you made an unsupported assertion?
c) where you tried to tie my arguments to a personal belief?
I can do this if you want, show every little logical fallacy and stupid thing you said. If I do this though, you'll be no longer welcome to post on here. I understand you are dyslexic, but this medium is a text-based medium. It pays to be understood. If you were using broken english and being barely comprehensible, having english as your 2nd language is no excuse - it's all about communication.
Anyway, your choice. either walk away now, or I spend a lot of time and effort debunking your nonsense which will mean I have no patience for you in the future.
Kel, I id say I was exagerating.
And, Also,for soemone who continualy blkmes me with misrepresenting you, you misrepresent me a lot.
Ill repeat, I never said Atheism itself was a Religion. But Theism isnt a Religion either.
What I actually argued was that Atheists don't lack religion. All Atheists have a Religion or anther. THis sint the samehtign as sayign "Ahtiesm is a Religion".
However,if you are a Secular Humanist, Secular Humanism is your Religion. The fact that a Secular Humanist is also an Atheist doens't really mean he is not Religious.
The fact that Christianity differs form Athiesm in that Ahtiems is simply lack of beleif in a god and Chistiantiy invovles a good deal more than just beleif about Gods eixstance proves that you dont really repsond to what Im saying.Im acutally saying that your not just an Atheist, and that yor Atheism contians doctriens just as compelxeas Christianity sayign Jesus is God or the Trinity.
So to repeat, ascmuch as Atheism itself is not a Religion, atheists are not non-religious. You are Religious, Kel, because you accept a set of ideas about how the world works. This includes Atheism, but Athiesmis just one idea,not a set.
By the way,Memes themselves are a Religiosu concept,even in your definition fo Religion. Its not like they are proven to exist.In fact,they exist only in the imaginations of Richard Dawkisn and his followrs.
Memetic Transfer is a fantasy, really,its just not how Informaiton really transfers.
Memes themselves dont really exist.
oH AND FOR THE FIRTS TIME, i REMOVED A POST.IT WAS A REPEAT OF THE ONE BELOW. noneed for two.
"You are Religious, Kel, because you accept a set of ideas about how the world works. This includes Atheism, but Athiesmis just one idea,not a set."
I tentatively accept ideas about how the world works.
And I think you are missing the point. Even if I'm religious under your definition, it doesn't matter one little bit to my arguments. I'm not trying to paint all religion as evil, nor am I trying to point to religion as the only evil in the world. If you can find anywhere on my blog where I even suggest such a thing (there are over 100 posts to choose from) then I'll eat my hat.
You are the first person ever to get upset at my use of the word religion - after talking to many theists and many atheists, you are the first one to complain. Why? It's so irrelevant. Worse still is that you are trying to get me to play semantic word-games where you are trying to get me to swap my definitions whereby the meaning is lost. Like saying "some theists think God is natural so supernaturalism doesn't apply." Of course they do, I wasn't denying that. But you were pushing me to use another definition for whatever reason.
I'll say this as clear as fucking possible. No idea should be sacred, every idea should come under scrutiny. Organised religion has a way of protecting itself from criticism which means that when bad things happen within, people are going to be outspoken. Do I want organised religion eradicated? No. I would like to see extremism minimised and that the moderates do a better job marginalising the fundamentalists. I would like to see dogma shunned where it conflicts with secular reasoning, that creationism would go away - it has been demonstrated to be wrong time and time again. But I don't want to take religion as the source of evil, and speaking out on religion doesn't mean I want to eradicate it.
As for memes, they are an analogy - a way of expressing the transfer of cultural information as opposed to genetic information. We are not the only species to pass down information culturally, yet this cultural information is vital for our survival.
Again, I wouldn't say things like:
In fact,they exist only in the imaginations of Richard Dawkisn and his followrs.Why do that again? Why do you argue this way?
Kel, Im not upset, Im making a point.
By defining this as a debate between Religious people and Atheists, it creates a false picture of hje talks. We no longer are talkign abotu sdoacific ideas, we are talking abitu "Religion' and Nonreligiosu peolel dont want or need religion so will just ignroe it merrily... its not abotu scrutiny of ideas, its abotu setitng up batle lines and pintign pretty mental pictures.
After all, I've een Atheists use not only "Non-Religious" as a synonym for themselves, but Freethinker and Rationalist as well.
Being that Im a Rationalist, woudln't it be rather poitnless to have a debate agaisnt the value of intrinsic reason with me? But many Athiests think Religion and reaosn cannto go togather because f how they udnerstand, not Rekigion, but Athiesm.
What you fail to udnerstand is that we are, in the end, relaly just talkign abitu ideas and sets of beleifs and philosophicla modles, and they arne't fundamentlaly different. Your "Nonreligious" beleifs are exacltyt he same as "Religious" ones. In fact, they are Religion in how Religion is actually understood sociologiclaly.
As to your claim that Orignised Relgiions sheild themselves from Critisism and try to prevent quesitoning, and the usual tlak of the need ot let all ideas be callenged, this is just not true.
For one thing, Orginised Religions acutlaly do allow critiissm of their teachings and beleifs by and large. IE, the Presbyterian Church has acadmeics routinely chllenge the general synod based on their intepretation of either the bIble or current events, and the same canbe said of hte United Methodist Church. The United Church of Christ allows comlltye open dialouge aboutthese matters as well.
The claim may be part of the hwole iamge of why Religion is wrong an why we need mroe Atheism, but its not an accurate picture of what happens in Orginised Religions at all.
Worse, the New Athiests, like Dawkins and Harrias, really don't want us to examien all idea sunder scrutiny. They want us ot be Hypersceptical of Religiosu beleifs, and to embrace their spacific brand of Atheism, which goes well beyidn lakc of beelif in a god and includes an enture naturalistic worldview roote din Humanist assumptions.
Humanist asusmptions, I may add, tat they not only never quesiton but refuse to allow others to question.
They wont even allow us to wuestion rather or not their vieews consittute a Relgiion, becaus htey want th term to be used on everyoen elses beleifs to shwo them as evil.
I never said you personally thought all Relgiions where evil, though, and your now misrepresentign me.
However, I do think the idea htta we need ot allow all ideas ot be Scrutinised is a good one, but so long as we make these arificial divisions, we wont.
How often do you scrutinise your "Nonreligious" beleifs anyway, Kel?
By the wya, I know the excuse that Memes ar ejust allegories, but Dawkisn seldom treats them as such, nor do his followrs. That canard is broguth about mainly in order to sheild his idea form Critisism, because he knows it wont stand up.

Psychology Of Voting
September 23, 2008
There are a lot of jokes that start: “There are two kinds of people…” I suppose that when it comes to politics, there are those who vote and those don’t.
Psychology is the study of all kinds of people. It’s about what we do, and why we do it. In our most recent election, some people voted but others who could have did not. Why people choose to do one behavior and not do another is part of what psychology studies.
But psychology isn’t limited to just one perspective. Voting could be explained by decision theory. Some researchers might choose to examine personality traits of the voters, the candidates or both. Other research might look at the media clips, or analyze the influence of positive or negative ads. Still others might use mathematical models to predict voting patterns.
What all approaches in psychology share is an emphasis on systematic observation. Regardless of the research technique, we rely on observations to identify patterns of behavior. We’re not all that interested in a single instance of behavior. Psychology looks for general principles that explain, and hopefully predict, human behavior. One election is interesting but having patterns of behavior is our ultimate goal. We want to know why people do the things they do.
For more on why people are the way they are, check out our free course on Personality. Everything you need to learn about personality is there. We give no college credit because we don’t charge anything.

This is from a newspaper in New South Wales (Australia). Many Australians disapprove of the close ties between John Howard the prime minister and Bush. The ABC is the Australian Broadcasting System
Iraq heartache is all about oil
“IF Iraq had been exporting cumquats instead of oil this war would not have happened.”
Former United Nations chief weapons inspector Hans Blix made this statement during an interview on ABC Radio National.
It is now well known how intelligence reports were “adjusted” to justify the reasons given for the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq.
Saddam Hussein was eliminated, but the alleged weapons of mass destruction did not exist.
Anarchy and chaos now reign supreme in the rampant power struggle under way.
And yet the three leaders of democratic nations, Bush, Blair and Howard, still insist they are delivering democracy to Iraq.
Instead they have delivered destruction, disruption, death and displacement to hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians.
Our Prime Minister Mr John Howard claimed he was misinformed by the best intelligence available at the time of his decision.
Now he asks for more patience until the job is done.
Does he mean until another despot takes control? Or perhaps until the Iraqi oil wells are corporatised, as it was suggested in a recent forum on the Iraq war.
In four years we have seen this particular corporatised, militarised action as morally bankrupt.
During the past 11 years we have seen an “Honest John” transform to an “artful dodger”, evading accountability.
A re-election of the Howard Government would be construed as an endorsement of John Howard’s policy on Iraq, thus giving permit for a similar debacle to occur again.
Accountability is vital to maintain a healthy and vibrant democracy.

The new grill came with a griddle so we grilled pancakes, sausage and eggs and even ate them out on the deck. They said when I bought this grill that it would change the way I think about grilling and it has. Grilling pancakes was never something I thought I would do but they came out perfect and I will do it again. Saves me from heating up the house during these blistering Kansas days.
Makes me think I need a second griddle as this one had enough room for 6 pancakes but when the kids are back from camp I will want room to cook even more of them. I am sure they will find it funny that daddy can grill pancakes.

WASHINGTON STATE -- Local state parks are looking for new ways to generate cash now that Washington is expecting its parks system to be self-sufficient by next year. Birch Bay State Park manager Ted Morris says they haven't received any tax funding as of last July, and in February they had to shed some full-time positions. He says they've dealt with the loss of funding by cutting back on maintenance projects. Morris says this summer will be a test for state parks to see if they can generate enough money from users alone. He says the $10 a day Discover Passes created by the state last year have so far failed to bring in big revenues. If state parks can't pay for themselves, the State Parks Director says some parks might have to be run by private corporations or non-profit groups. Morris says they have one ranger on staff for every 300,000 campers at Birch Bay State Park, and they also utilize a total of 3,000 hours of volunteer work each year.

A number of seismologists have concluded that the 5.7-magnitude earthquake that hit near Prague a year and a half ago was caused by injecting wastewater from oil and gas production deep underground.
Earthquakes in other states have been linked to disposal wells, but Oklahoma’s is the largest. Yet Oklahoma’s regulatory response has been one of the smallest.
Seismologists have linked wastewater disposal wells to earthquakes in at least a half-dozen states. On a geologic scale, the tremors are small. And the quakes — in states like Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, and Ohio — have all been smaller than the November 2011 quake that shook Oklahoma near Prague..

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling against Oklahoma State University's athletic fundraising arm and its top booster, T. Boone Pickens, in their attempt to recover life insurance premiums in a fundraising plan.
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans handed down the decision Monday. It involves OSU's ``Gift of a Lifetime'' program, which involved $10 million insurance policies on 27 supporters with the university as beneficiary. OSU believed it would raise millions of dollars through the effort.
The court affirmed a March 2012 decision by U.S. District Judge Jorge A. Solis in Dallas, who ruled that Lincoln National Life Insurance Co. could keep premiums it received from OSU. Lincoln claimed the school waited too long to cancel the policies and was not entitled to refunds.

The air is stuffy and humid, and the rainy season has made the tin roof leak in the Pattiradjawane home.
''When the roof is leaking, we must put our children on the table," Mei Pattiradjawane, 33, told Khabar Southeast Asia.
The Pattiradjawanes share the building in Passo Village, near Ambon City,Indonesia with eight other families. Each family has about 500 square feet of living space, separated by thin wood boards. It is part of a camp for internally displaced people (IDPs), hastily constructed in the wake of the sectarian violence in Ambon from 1999-2002.
Hundreds of similar camps are spread throughout the province of Maluku.
Ten years later, the Pattiradjawane family and many others still live in such camps, despite heartbreaking conditions – due to security issues, job opportunities and lingering trauma.
Mei and Roy Pattiradjawane fled Kariuw village in Central Maluku and moved into this building in 2002. Later the same year, they received resettlement funds to buy a house – but didn't do so, they acknowledge. Today, Roy is a labourer in Ambon City. Like many people in Passo Village, his family members are no longer registered as IDPs.
"Most of us living here already consider Passo as a home. We do not want to go back to our hometown because there are no jobs. Our nutmeg trees were destroyed during the conflict. We opted to stay in Ambon, hoping we will get better jobs and education for our kids, although there is no more government aid," Roy told Khabar.
"We choose to live in Passo because we are in fear of returning home," added Jersen Marian, 56, another resident of the building.
More than 700,000 people were displaced by violence in Ambon from 1999-2002, and some 30,000 had yet to be resettled by early 2011, according to UNICEF.
"The conflict never ends"
The trauma wrought by the violence has spilled beyond Maluku province, lodged in the hearts and minds of survivors.
Yonara Wedak left Ambon in 2002 with her husband, using resettlement funds to find a new home in East Java. Even there, for her, the conflict lives on.
"Every time I think about what happened in Ambon, it frightens me. The conflict never ends. I never feel safe," she told Khabar in Madiun, where she now lives.
"All the blood and memories are still clear in my head. I still can imagine those suffering refugees, hungry kids, many tears and diseases – truly heartbreaking. I guess this is the price we have to pay for the conflict," she said.
"Most refugees like me will be traumatized hearing guns shootings, the military car sirens, and the crying of a mother losing a child and a child losing everything."
One such child is Manina Pessau, a refugee from Central Maluku, who now lives in Madiun after more than ten years in a refugee camp. She arrived at the camp at the age of nine, on her own.
"As a nine year old girl, not knowing anything – where could I go? And not knowing anybody in the camps was really painful. I think that was the worst pain I could remember. I learned that both my parents were dead a year later."
She seems hesitant to discuss the past, and how she managed to survive on her own so long.
Initially, refugees received funding from the government and national and international relief agencies. "However, it has been awhile, and we have had to struggle on our own," she told Khabar.
Seeds of conflict
The roots of conflict in the "Spice Islands" can be traced to the sixteenth century, when the region's rich supply of nutmeg and cloves brought Dutch colonists and Christianity. Dutch policy provided Christians with better land, security, and education, sowing the seeds for alienation with the Muslim community.
Centuries later, Jihadists from Muslim-dominated areas of Indonesia and even the Philippines travelled to the Maluku islands to "defend" their Muslim brothers, escalating the conflict to its worst ever outbreak from 1999-2002 in which as many as 9,000 may have died.
"The situation in Ambon is one example of a latent conflict in Indonesia. The conflict itself is deeper than just a religious conflict," said Sutoro Eko, a senior researcher at the Institute for Research and Empowerment (IRE) Yogyakarta.
Conflict flared again in September 2011, when rumors that a taxi driver had been tortured to death sparked riots, leading to six deaths, 89 injuries, and another wave of IDPs.
"After the conflict we did a data collection, and we found 278 units of houses were damaged, 195 units were burned by fires, another 30 units were severely damaged and another 53 homes suffered minor damage," Jan Haumasse, the Ambonese chairman for IDPs, told Khabar.
The displaced crowded into mosques, elementary schools, and government buildings, numbering some 8,990 people, local government officials said.
Violence broke out again during a Pattimura Day procession in May 2012, due to a conflict between factions of spectators about who had the right to carry the torch honoring the independence hero. Fifty civilians were injured in the brawl, and three homes were set ablaze.
Protecting one another
In both cases, the central government reacted fast, dispatching riot troops and conducting rigorous community outreach to prevent a repeat of the sectarian warfare of a decade ago.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono praised growing religious harmony in Ambon when it successfully hosted the 24th National Musabaqah Tilawatil Qur'an, or Qur'an Recital Competition, in June.
Martina de Brito, the wife of an Ambonese pastor, tells how her family was protected by Muslim leaders during the conflict in 2011.
"Our house was among the Muslim community. During the conflict, people were attacking all these places. My family was lucky that the imam in the mosque was helping us to find safe locations until the conflict subsided."
Martina refused to say more, protecting the person who protected her.
"You never know when the conflict is going to happen again in the future. At this point, I want to keep my savior safe. Media spotlights can be dangerous for him," she added.

There are many more beliefs associated with color red. But One thing which is globally associated with Holidays & Red is Santa Claus. I too wanted to make something special for Christmas but i have been eating too many cookies, chocolates etc and I am sure Santa also might be more than a little bored eating cookies & milk in every house on this planet. I made every cell in my brain work overtime to come up with something festive, easy ( on tummy), something with Desi touch ( was optional). My brain doesn't work as fast as google so i spent more than a hour thinking finally I got the answer. It was Paratha...Yeah yeah its a little off- beat since its BEET paratha. It was delicious, easy to make & festive looking.
Lets chk the recipe.
Lets chk the recipe.
Beet Paratha
Ingredients:
1 cup wheat Flour
1 beet
1 Potato ( small)
1 t spn ginger paste
1 t spn garlic paste
2 t spn cilantro leaves
Little bit of oil to drizzle over the parathas
salt to taste.
Method:
Cook beet and potatoes in pressure cooker till done ( upto 3 whistles is sufficient). Alternatively you can cook them in the microwave. Do not discard the water in which beet was cooked, This has nice red color which will enhance the color of the dough. Peel the outer skin from both, beet & potatos. Mash potatoes and beet together. In case the beet isn't as soft as potatoes, just grate it and mix. Mix all the other ingredients in cooked mixture and knead it till soft. Use the red water for kneading. Roll these like chapatis but a little thicker and cook on the griddle. Serve with chutney, pickles, sabzis, raita etc or anything else of your choice. They are so versatile that they taste nice with everything.
Merry Christmas !
Feliz Novidad !
joyeux Noel !

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Joe Burklund of Des Moines, Iowa, lost his job at the depths of recession in 2009 after 30 years in the advertising and marketing industry, he never imagined another career. He was almost 60 and optimistic he would land another job in his field, where he was earning $65,000 a year. After collecting unemployment checks for a year, Burklund took a part-time job at grocery chain Trader Joe's. As he watched his retirement savings bleed almost dry, he realized his situation would not turn around anytime soon. An acquaintance suggested he train for call center work, servicing banks and insurance companies. "I said, 'Well, I may as well try that because nothing else seems to be working,'" Burklund told Reuters. Thousands of Americans aged 55 and older are going back to school and reinventing themselves to get an edge in a difficult labor market, hoping to rebuild retirement nest eggs that were almost destroyed by the recession. "I went into it thinking 'I am not too sure I am cut out for call center work,' and I never really wanted to sell insurance. But I was willing to try anything to gain full employment," said Burklund, who has set aside hopes to retire at 65. Within two weeks of completing the program, he had three interviews and two job offers. In March, he started working at Marsh Insurance. A similar tale is recounted by Tom Halseth, about 380 miles east in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin. Halseth, 60, lost his job in May 2010 after 30 years as store manager with retail chain JC Penny. He spent 16 months unemployed. Today, Halseth is a quality assurance technician with dried fruit packer Mariani Packing Company in Wisconsin Rapids. He landed the job after a rigorous five-month program that included biology, chemistry and math classes and a two-week internship.. TOO YOUNG TO RETIRE Many older workers who lost jobs during the downturn are too young to retire and usually would not be considered ideal for retraining. Independent groups like the National Fund for Workforce Solutions, which is working with local communities and businesses to build skills and careers for workers and job seekers, are working to debunk that myth. In the last four years, the Fund has helped about 1,860 Americans 55 years and older retrain for new jobs. According to data from the Labor Department, 2.65 million people participated in its Workforce Investment Act programs in 2011. Those programs, which are also designed to help people find jobs, are separate from those run by independent groups like the National Fund for Workforce Solutions. About 345,000, or 13 percent of participants in the Workforce Investment Act programs, were 55 years and older. "If they have a 20-year record of being a great worker, companies will take them," said Fred Dedrick, executive director at the National Fund. He said the Fund, which worked with the academy in Iowa that trained Burklund and with the Mid-State Technical College in Wisconsin, where Halseth received his food manufacturing science certificate, has a 60 percent to 70 percent success rate finding jobs for graduates. "It also depends on the labor market. If you have an unemployment rate of 4 or 5 percent they will take them," said Dedrick. "But if you have a high unemployment rate of say 10 percent, and you have the choice of investing in somebody who is 50 or somebody who is 30, of course you will invest in the younger worker because they will be around longer." The unemployment rate for workers 55 years and older edged up to 6.3 percent in April from 6.2 percent in March. This age group accounted for 16 percent of the 12.5 million unemployed Americans last month. While the jobless rate for older Americans is much lower than the 8.1 percent national rate, it is double what it was when the recession started in December 2007, a statistic with which people like Paulette Gordon, 59, are all too familiar. Gordon, from Houston, Texas, lost her job as a technical analyst for energy companies two years ago after three decades structuring acquisitions of oil and gas wells. She brushed up her resume to include administration skills. So far that has not yielded anything and last month she sold her jewelry to pay rent. "I am surviving by the grace of God," Gordon said. Productivity experts like Frank Lonergen say it is a mistake to overlook these so-called baby boomers, given their wealth of experience. Lonergen, whose company Ancile Solutions helps businesses to improve employee productivity through training, argues there is not much difference in terms of performance between a 25-year-old worker and a 55-year-old one if both are afforded the right opportunities. While it is a reasonable expectation that somebody hired at 55 would want to retire at 65, it could also be argued that a 25-year-old would probably not build a career at a single company, he said. "I think a 55-year-old worker who has the opportunity to come in and is given the right framework to help them get on board would have a much longer tenure than a 25-year-old," said Lonergen. "The tendency for 25-year-old workers is to look at accelerating their career after two or three years." MINIMUM WAGE SALARIES Even with new skills, older workers are re-entering the labor market at very low salaries, in most cases just above the minimum wage, which can be as low as $5.15 an hour and no higher than $9.04 an hour, depending on the state. Given the damage inflicted on their savings by the recession, this means many will probably continue to work well past the usual retirement age of 65, a fact acknowledged by both Burklund and Halseth. The share of Americans 55 years and older who are in the work force - which means either working or unemployed but looking for a job - is 1.4 percentage points higher than when the recession started. In contrast, the overall labor force participation rate dropped in April to a 30-year low. Last month, 4.6 percent of workers aged 55 and older held more than one job, according to AARP and government data. Halseth declined to specify his salary, but said it was a third of what he made as a JC Penny store manager. "While what I am making now is well above minimum wage, it would be hard to make a good living out of it," he said. "At least I have a job and the possibility of going up. My 401k (retirement plan) was ravaged by the recession; that's one of the reasons I will keep working," said Halseth. "Before, I could have retired at 62 and retired comfortably, but I can't do that anymore. I want to work until 70, if I could." Similar sentiments were expressed by Burklund. "Right now I am making $32,000 a year and there is a bonus program. I may not retire until my late 60s," said Burklund, who likes to joke that he will retire six months after his death.

Quick Thoughts On The GETCO – Knight Capital Group Story
- Posted by kid dynamite
- on November 28th, 2012
The headline today is “GETCO offers to buy $KCG for $3.50 per share.” There’s one major problem with this headline: it’s not accurate.
The first thing you need to do if you want to talk about this situation is read the proposal that GETCO made to Knight.
Remember a few months ago when I wrote a post about the Sprint ($S: long) merger with Softbank? This proposal is similar in some ways. Let’s go to the details, emphasis mine:
”
Now, when I look at the recently filed KCG 10q, I come up with a current fully diluted share count of about 365MM. If anyone disagrees with my numbers, please do let me know.
So: start with 365MM shares of KCG fully diluted, currently (that assumes the conversion of the Preferred into Class A common).
add: 242MM new shares that GETCO will receive, and subtract the 57MM shares currently owned by GETCO which would be retired* then:
subtract: 154MM shares that GETCO will tender for at $3.50 each and we’re left with:
396MM shares outstanding in the new GETCO/Knight. I completely ignored the warrants described above, which would be further dilutive, because I have no idea how to value GETCO anyway.
What’s my point here?
Well, my point is that this isn’t a $3.50 cash buyout for $KCG shares. It’s a merger PROPOSAL, and it involves a tender for half of the outstanding fully diluted shares that GETCO doesn’t already own. There will be a “back end” company that trades: the combined GETCO/Knight. What is that puppy worth? That’s the billion dollar question. I have no friggin’ idea.
Of course, this is just a proposal from GETCO, and they are not the only suitor looking at Knight.
disclosure: at the time I am hitting “publish” on this post, I have NO POSITIONS in $KCG
EDIT: Here is a much better post than mine, with the math I didn’t do

As the United States observes the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you may be wondering what you can do to mark the occasion.
Lots of people are calling for September 11 to become a national day of volunteering. Why not honor the heroes of 9/11 by becoming a hero to someone else?
Volunteering gives you an opportunity to change lives, including your own. If you're feeling frustrated or overwhelmed by the news of a disaster, volunteering to help can be a great way to cope. If you'd like to support a cause but can't afford to donate money, you can donate your time instead.
Helping others in need is such an important part of the American way of life that many high schools require their students to spend a certain number of hours volunteering in order to graduate.
So how do you go about it?.
Volunteering is a great way to learn new skills — from working as part of a team to setting and reaching goals. It gives you a chance to discover what kinds of things you're best at and enjoy the most. A volunteer job that you love can even help shape your ideas about your career goals.
Volunteering also can provide you with a sense of responsibility because people really depend on you. And it can help you develop a new understanding of people who are different from you — people with disabilities, people in financial distress, sick kids, or the elderly.
Donating your time is a great way to feel like you have the power to change things for the better. When people depend on you, it can change the way you look at yourself. You can feel proud of the goals that you've achieved for an organization — whether it's helping to organize a 10K to raise money for breast cancer or running the race itself.
Volunteering is also a great way to get a perspective on your own life. Sometimes it's easy to get consumed by worries about your grades or the fight you had with your friend or parent. And although these things are very important in their own way, sometimes it can be helpful to get some distance and think about other things. Volunteering allows you to do this. It lets you focus on others and see that your involvement in the world can be meaningful.
Finally, volunteering can help save you from being bored — it gives you a place to be where you can have a good time and keep busy.
When you donate your time to a cause you care about, it looks impressive on college or job applications. That's not the main reason for volunteering, of course — if you do it just to please other people or to look good you may not enjoy it. But volunteering does show others (and yourself!) that you are reliable enough to make a commitment and show up on schedule.
Volunteering also shows employers and colleges that you believe in making the world a better place — and that you're willing to sacrifice your time and energy to do it.
After you've decided what you're interested in and how much time you can devote, it's time to find out where you can volunteer.
You have several choices. You can search the Internet or look in your local phone book under "volunteer." You can call an organization directly and ask if they need volunteers in your area. You can ask friends or relatives for ideas and contacts or look on bulletin boards in your library or in bookstores. It's worth spending the time up front to identify a job that's a good fit for you.
When you're calling an organization to offer your time, it's best to ask for a volunteer coordinator. Be ready to answer some questions, like:
Most places will ask you to come for an interview, which is usually pretty casual. They want to talk to you face to face and if they haven't yet asked the questions above, they will do it at the interview.
Whether your interview is on the phone or in person, don't forget to ask questions of your own.,

Want to throw a beautiful party? A flower themed party can be fun, frilly and visually stunning. The amount of frills is up to you, but most flower themed parties can be executed with little more than some craft supplies you probably already have and a flower shaped cookie cutter. Whether you are celebrating a birthday, first communion or springtime holiday, a flower theme is perfect for a backyard that is already in bloom. Spring, however, isn’t the only season to celebrate with a flower party. A combination of artificial flowers and seasonal blooms make the flower party an option for any time of year.
1. Invitations
You can use store bought flower themed invitations or easily create your own. One idea to create a simple flower party invitation.
Additional options for flower themed party invitations:
Additional options for flower themed party invitations:
- Have your child draw and color flowers onto blank notecards.
- Use a rubber stamp to decorate ordinary invitations with a floral design.
- Print the party details on large mailing labels. Stick them to the backs of flower seed packets.
2. Decorations
You can purchase several floral decorations from the craft store, party supply store or even the dollar store. Homemade decorations are also an option, many of which are easy enough to create, such as these tissue paper flowers.
Additional Decorating Ideas.
3. Games and Activities
Keep the floral theme going through a variety of games and activities. Suggestions for flower-themed party games include:
- Musical flowers (cut out large flower shapes and place in a row on floor. Use these as the seats to play musical chairs. Play a flower themed song such as Ring Around the Rosie as the music for this game.
- Play “Diana likes Daisies.” In this game, the players sit in a circle. The first player states her first name and a flower she likes that begins with the same letter as her name. The next player does the same and also repeats the name and flower chosen by the first player. For instance, if player one says “My name is Diana and I like daisies,” player two will say “My name is Lisa and I like lilies and she is Diana who likes daisies.” Play continues around the circle and anyone who forgets a name or flower is out. Keep a list of flower names on hand for players who may have trouble thinking of ones that match their names.
- Have a watering can relay race where players must use a watering can to fill a large bucket with water. If playing this game indoors, use confetti instead of water to save floors and carpets from inevitable spills.
- Paint flower pots or watering cans.
- Make Flower Bracelet Balloon Animals.
- String head bands using silk flower petals.
- Make flower-shaped sugar cookies and have kids decorate them with icing, sprinkles and a variety of small candy pieces.
4. Food
That flower shaped cookie cutter isn’t off duty yet. Put it to work creating some of your flower party menu items. Ideas include:
- Flower shaped sandwiches.
- Flower shaped quesadillas.
- Flower shaped pizza muffins (cut the shapes before topping with sauce and cheese).
- Flower shaped cookies.
- Flower shaped brownies.
- Flower shaped cereal treats.
- Flower cupcakes or a flower themed cake.
- Serve food such as chips, pretzels or pasta from flower pots and pour drinks from watering cans.
5. Favors
Party crafts like the painted flower pots or floral beaded jewelry made at the party can also double as the party favors. Additional suggestions for take home gifts:
- Lollipop flowers
- Flower pot and flower seed packets
- Miniature watering cans
- A box of flower shaped cookies
- A bouquet of fresh flowers

Sunday, April 3rd - - Still heading West, I came across this “tribute” to the Texas Longhorn.
I stopped for the night at Copper Breaks State Park (west of Wichita Falls). Though not far, the drive had been tiring - lots of wind with gusts from 35-50 mph and it was hot! Really hot.
The photo above was taken at 5:24 pm at the campground; the van was in the shade! Yep, it was hot. I did manage to go for a very short walk (about 10 minutes) after driving up to an overlook to get this picture (below) of the lake. The “lower” campground where I stayed was on the left side of the lake. Being lower didn't provide any relief from the wind or the heat.
The sun was completely hidden beneath the hills but for a few brief moments it lit up the clouds like they were on fire, appropriate for such a hot day. The setting of the sun provided little relief from the heat. Even with doors and windows open, it was perhaps one of the most uncomfortable nights spent on the road thus far. Relief did arrive, however, when after midnight a front moved through and the temperature dropped dramatically. When I got up the next morning it was a chilly 48 degrees! And still windy.
And today you are near where I grew up in Texas - Seymour - and Wichita Falls was the "big city" for us!
I've never felt 108 degrees, can't imagine the feeling. Hope you got cooled off, thanks to the car.
I like it hot but not that hot! I wouldn't have been happy with a 60 degree drop either.

Or should that be house music all weekend long...
Saturday night saw Telford playing with Jeff Mills down at the sub.
If I tell you that Mills's first few tracks included Inner City and Robert Owens, you're right to guess it was no techno set! It was amazing, but I left about half two, to go home and try to get my stuff ready, to fly out to Berlin on Sunday afternoon
We left Glasgow in torrential rain but arrived in Berlin to blue skies and sunshine. Once there, J&T dropped stuff at their hotel and then we headed straight round to Kater Holzig to meet the lovely Tobi Neumann
It was only once we were inside, that it dawned on me, that the cat on the roof was the very same cat, I had kept trying to get a picture of the last time I was here. We passed it on the ubahn every day.
There are scarcely any words for how crazy Kater Holzig are.
It's totally surreal.
It feels like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean but with more colourful characters!
We were met by the charming Nick Slingerland, who smiled sweetly the whole time. He showed us around and told us they would probably go on until Tuesday morning!
I should have realised just how long this party would last when we saw that Tobi had three record bags. "The good thing about playing at home home" he said.
I wish that I could say that I was as hardcore as Telford and Junior.
But truthfully I can't
They played for 10 freakin' hours until 9am.
That might be be pretty par for the course in Berlin, but back home here in Glasgow, that is like the equivilant of 3 Saturday nights. 3 nights in one set!!!!!
When my little paper fan folded in the insane overwhelming heat, so did I...
I had to go back to the hotel and lie on top of the bed for a couple of hours before heading straight back to the airport to fly back home.
They are still in Berlin and flying out to Sonar in the morning.
In the departure lounge I met my dear friend Jonnie Wilkes , he had been playing on Friday and Saturday night.
He and Keith are booked to play The Panorama Bar on October 27th.
So needless to say before I even left the city, I had already agreed to come back for another party!
See you in October Berlin (if not before....)

Trusted Managers, New Funds
During a 12-year stint at the helm of fbr focus, Chuck Akre compiled a distinguished record as a stock picker. Between 1997 and 2009, his fund posted an annualized return of 13%, better than 90% of its peers. But three years ago, Akre walked away from FBR to launch his own fund, Akre Focus. Though his fund has a new name, Akre says, little else has changed. He follows the same investing mandate he used at FBR: to find well-managed companies of any size with high and sustainable profitability.
SEE ALSO: Our Guide to Mutual Funds
So far, things have worked out well for Akre and his shareholders. Since Akre Focus’s inception in August 2009, the fund, a member of the Kiplinger 25, has gained 15.0% annualized. The fund outpaced Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index in 2010 by four percentage points; in 2011, it beat the index by almost nine points.

The success of Akre Focus led us to search for other relatively new funds with proven managers behind them. We found several, including DoubleLine Total Return, run by Jeffrey Gundlach and Philip Barach, who broke away from TCW to found DoubleLine in 2010. But not all of the new funds were worth crowing about. Some of the managers, for instance, had great records at their old shops but spotty returns at their new ones—or vice versa. In the end, we found six no-load funds that deserve a closer look. All are run by well-known managers who had stellar records at bigger shops and left to launch their own funds, and all are still going strong.
Seeking Fast Growth
Robert Gardiner and Blake Walker cut their teeth at Wasatch, a firm that specializes in fast-growing small and midsize companies. In 2011, they left to form Grandeur Peak, which, like Wasatch, is based in Salt Lake City.
But a couple of things haven’t changed. The view from their new digs is the same: Both the Wasatch and Grandeur Peak offices look out on the Wasatch Mountain range. The investing strategy is the same, too. “We try to execute the core Wasatch philosophy with precision,” says Walker.
Until recently, the pair ran Wasatch Global Opportunities, a fund that invests in fast-growing companies of all sizes headquartered anywhere in the world. In 2009 and 2010, the fund’s first two years of existence, it gained 61% and 26%, respectively, outpacing 96% of its global fund peers the first year and 95% the second. Before that, Gardiner managed Wasatch Micro Cap Fund, racking up an annualized return of 25% during his tenure, from June 1995 through December 2006.
Last October, Gardiner and Walker launched Grandeur Peak Global Opportunities (symbol GPGOX), which invests all over the world, and Grandeur Peak International Opportunities (GPIOX), which buys only foreign stocks. Like their previous Wasatch funds, the new ones focus on growth stocks. But instead of combing through companies of all sizes, the managers home in on small companies, with market capitalizations from $50 million to $1 billion. “It’s easy to set up a large-cap value fund and buy Samsung,” says Walker. “It’s harder to knock on doors and uncover these little pebbles.”
He and Gardiner look for companies with little debt and hefty profit margins. They carefully analyze those that look most promising, a process that includes making their own earnings forecasts. They visit the firms with the best prospects—those with estimated long-term profit growth of at least 15% a year. In Grandeur’s first six months, the managers traveled to China, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Brazil, South Africa, India, France, Germany and the U.K. “I’m trying to stay married,” says Walker, “but we’re on the road constantly.”
In the end, Walker and Gardiner seek what many other growth-stock managers want: companies with a sustainable competitive edge, a good management team and a strong business model. “And headroom,” adds Walker. “We want the market it operates in to be big enough for these guys to grow a long time.” So far, so good, despite wobbly foreign markets of late. From their inception, the Global and International funds have gained 11.0% and 8.0%, respectively, beating the 7.8% return of the MSCI World index. (All returns are through June 29.)
Global Bargain Hunter
The world’s stock markets have never been more attractive, says David Winters, manager of Wintergreen Investor (WGRNX). “Today, I feel like a kid in a candy store with $100 in my pocket.”
That’s because stocks are depressed all over the world, and Winters loves a good bargain. Not surprising for someone who got his training at Mutual Series under legendary value managers Max Heine and Michael Price (Franklin Templeton bought Mutual Series in 1996). Winters spent almost 30 years at Mutual Series, starting as an analyst and rising to CEO, president and chief investment officer.
But in 2005, Winters left to start his own shop and launch the Wintergreen fund. Over the past five years, the fund returned an annualized 1.5%. That may sound slim, but it beats the MSCI World index by an average of 3.6 percentage points per year.
Wintergreen can invest in companies large or small. But Winters will buy only if a company meets his definition of an investing trifecta: The company must have good or improving economics, be run by a management team that’s working for all shareholders, and trade at a value price. A bargain, in his mind, is a company that’s trading for less than what he thinks it’s worth. Winters uses several methods to arrive at that number, including the “arm’s length test”—what a knowledgeable buyer would pay to buy a company. He keeps tabs on takeovers and mergers to get a sense of the worth of companies in various industries.
Winters has free rein to invest wherever he finds opportunity—in the U.S. and overseas, including emerging markets, and in any asset class, including stocks, corporate bonds and government debt. These days, he’s been eyeing stocks, especially those that trade in Switzerland and the U.K. (“no euro zone” issues, he says) and in Hong Kong and Malaysia. One stock he has held for a long time is the conglomerate Genting Malaysia Berhad. When Winters visited Malaysia six years ago, Genting was a small domestic company with a great balance sheet, able executives and international aspirations. Today it is part of a gambling duopoly in Singapore (Genting and Las Vegas Sands are the only companies with gaming licenses there), and it has a casino in the Philippines, among other international businesses. “We buy companies that we think will do well in the future without paying for that future growth,” says Winters.
Winters typically turns over 11% to 15% of his portfolio annually, suggesting that he holds on to stocks for seven to nine years, on average. “When you trade, you’re making another decision,” says Winters. “We would rather make fewer and better decisions.” Yet Winters makes sure to have plenty of cash on hand (about 14% at last word) so he can be “in a position to accumulate” when the market gets bumpy.
In Sync from a Distance
More than 1,200 miles separate Larry Pitkowsky and Keith Trauner. Pitkowsky lives in New Jersey; Trauner, in Florida. But after working together at Fairholme Fund for close to a decade—at times as co-managers—Trauner says they “don’t have to say a lot” to understand each other.
The proof is in GoodHaven Fund (GOODX), which the pair launched in April 2011. Over the past year, the concentrated portfolio of bargain-priced stocks (the fund holds just 19 companies) returned 6.8%. The S&P 500, meanwhile, returned 5.5%.
Much like Fairholme, GoodHaven can invest in almost anything: stocks in companies of any size the world over and bonds of any type, from U.S. Treasuries to junk bonds and from mortgage securities to bank loans.
The central theme that ties the disparate asset classes together is value. Pitkowsky and Trauner, each of whom has $1 million invested in the fund, find ideas by scanning lists of beaten-down stocks and companies poised for a turnaround. They look at what other sharp value managers are buying, too. The goal: to find good companies trading for less than what they think the firms are worth.
The fund may own both a company’s stock and its bonds. “If we like the stock, we ought to love the bond,” says Trauner. Take Walter Investment Management. The little-known company specializes in servicing mortgages of troubled borrowers—a skill set in high demand these days. Walter does “a good job of keeping people in their homes and paying their mortgages,” says Trauner. Shares in Walter Investment have climbed about 30% since the managers began buying the stock. On the bond side, the fund owns issues in a Walter bank loan due in 2016 with a 12.5% coupon rate.
In Search of Megatrends
Before Mitch Rubin and Morty Schaja left the Baron funds in 2006 to found RiverPark Advisers, they had a string of successes. Rubin had several stints running various Baron funds; at Baron Fifth Avenue Growth from 2004 to 2006, he outpaced the broader stock market and the average large-company growth fund. And during his 15-year tenure at Baron, Schaja held many roles, including chief operating officer and president, and saw the company’s assets under management grow from $40 million to $15 billion.
Now RiverPark is a family of six funds. Schaja serves as CEO, and Rubin manages three of the funds. Two funds caught our eye: RiverPark Large Growth (RPXFX) and RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity (RLSFX).
At RiverPark, Rubin uses the same approach he learned at Baron: He looks for growing, well-managed companies that are poised to benefit from long-term trends, such as aging populations, the move to digital content and information, and growing global consumption of energy and commodities. With the large-company fund, that’s led him to Apple, Monsanto and Google. Over the past year, Large Growth returned 8.9%, outpacing the S&P 500 by 3.4 percentage points.
Long/Short Opportunity’s strategy may seem like a radical departure from that of Large Growth. But Rubin sees Long/Short as the “culmination” of all the experience he has gained over the past 20 years. With Long/Short, he can invest in large and small companies that are growing, have sound management and are in a position to benefit from a megatrend. But the fund also allows Rubin to short stocks that fail miserably at fitting the bill—companies that are in contracting markets, are growing slowly (if at all), have low barriers to entry or are capital-intensive. “The long bets are our highest-conviction ideas,” says Rubin. “And the shorts keep us skeptical.”
Long/Short began in October 2009 as a hedge fund, but RiverPark converted it to a mutual fund in March 2012. Although the record of the fund’s retail shares goes back only to the conversion, regulators are allowing RiverPark to promote the hedge fund’s record going back to 2009 because the fund’s strategy has stayed the same. Since its inception, the hedge-fund-turned-mutual-fund has returned 19.6% annualized.

Our brand new feature wall at the studio. Aubergine! It just went so well with the green that we used for the windows. And I really like it!
The studio office is really starting to come together. This weekend Bianca and I tackled Ikea and came back with a carload of shelves and desks and drawers. Two bruised palms and one purple fingernail later (ahh how ironic) I'd put together the whole lot in an allen key frenzy.
Myself, Bianca and Tegan in our studio office. Plenty more to be done but it's definitely on it's way :)
19 comments:
It's really starting to take shape isn't it. I'm also not a big fan of purple but this wall looks great. I am soooo envious, and of course I can't wait for you to open your new business :o)
Hee. I just bought that IKEA bin on the weekend too.
I can't believe how quickly you've got all of this together! Love those floors. And the wall. (I'm the same with purple - but I think it's because my sister in law will wear nothing BUT purple. Right down to the eye shadow. Seriously.)
It's gonna be great!!
The studio looks amazing! I would love, love, love to have a workspace like that. My workspace (er dining room) at home is also all IKEA (table, chairs, bookcase, drawers, even the lamp!). Gotta love them. Good luck with the rest of your preparations!
Nice! does this mean there will be a purple fabic collectin coming soon? ;)
Looking good! I love when I get a change of heart. It's like you get to appreciate something for the first time.
I liked the purple feature wall too! I was also impressed how you fitted the all the IKEA stuff in our SAAB - such a clever car with its folding rear seats and big hatchback.
Love, Dad
wow lara!!!things are looking great!!!cant wait for the studio to be up and running...!
Wow it's looking so good! I love the purple wall, I think it's a great colour!
I have been following yr studio progress and its really coming together now
I recently turned a corner with purple too.. Now I am in love with it - but it has to be the right hue! This wall looks great. How exciting.
hahaha, you're classic ;)
What a great colour for a feature wall - it looks terrific.
Your studio looks awesome, and the purple contrasts with the warm wood tones in such a nice way. I've never been a huge fan of purple, but this season it is definitely growing on me :)
Go girls! That looks like a great workspace.
I think the whole purple thing was global (man), so many of us - okay maybe not global - didn't like it, but there was 'the turning', and then people started posting that they liked it after poo pooing the 'chocolate for the eyes' crew as hippies (not that there's anything wrong with that). I like it too, now. It's not purple, it's mulberry! Or something like that.
Crazy enough the EXACT same story for me. I hated purple my whole life - until last year. I tried on a plum colored shirt... and now I love it.
just no lilac. *shudder*
what is the paint color? (brand & #)
Ummm, it was a strange little premixed 2.5 lt bottle by Taubmans called "prince" :)
you were at Ikea on the weekend? I was working both days! I wish I had known you were going to be there, I have a 15% discount you know ;)

City Council Will Vote on Controversial U-Gas Development Tonight
The gas station and convenience store has drawn opposition from nearby residents concerned about increased traffic and other impacts.
A controversial U-Gas Convenience Store planned for 915 N. Kirkwood Road will be up for its first vote by the Kirkwood City Council at a meeting tonight following a public hearing that drew some adorable, if formidable, opposition.
Residents have expressed concerns about the project’s impact on traffic, property values and the general welfare of the neighborhood and the Kirkwood Planning and Zoning Commission unanimously denied the company’s request for a special use exception permit.
Although the Kirkwood City Council can vote whether to approve the development regardless of the commission’s decision, the move required the company to ask for a public hearing, which was held Feb. 7.
Following the hearing and in light of the concerns raised, councilman Bob Sears moved to postpone a first vote on the project until today’s Kirkwood City Council meeting.

Pilot in good spirits after emergency landing in Breslau
Published Monday, January 7, 2013 3:53PM EST
Last Updated Monday, January 7, 2013 6:34PM EST
A tense moment in the skies over Waterloo Region ended with sighs of relief as a plane was able to land safely Monday afternoon.
Pascal Gosselin was the pilot and sole occupant of a five-seater Cessna P120 he was flying from Montreal to Breslau.
Up in the air above southern Ontario, Gosselin realized he had a problem – his landing gear refused to release.
“I tried a bunch of maneuvers to get the landing gear out – manually, putting some G-force on it – it wouldn’t come down,” pilot Pascal Gosselin told CTV.
The pilot’s first call was to his mechanic back home in Montreal, who made several suggestions, but not of them resulted in a successful deployment of the landing gear.
After that, Gosselin updated the Region of Waterloo International Airport control tower on the situation. Airport officials provided their own suggestions.
“He stayed in the air for 45 minutes more to try and rattle it down,” said airport manager Chris Wood.
With fire crews from Breslau and Maryhill now on their way to the airport, Gosselin brought the plane down, trying to pull off a controlled landing without his landing gear.
“It didn’t work. Ultimately he ended up putting his nose onto the runway,” said Wood.
It wasn’t a perfect landing, but it did allow Gosselin to get out of the plane safely and without injury.
The same couldn’t be said for the Cessna itself, which will need a new engine and propeller.
Still, Gosselin sees nothing that can’t be fixed.
“It’s just bent metal. She’ll be flying again,” he said.
“That’s what you have insurance for.”
CLARIFICATION: When this story was originally posted, an image of an aircraft not involved in this incident was inadvertently attached to the story. A correction has now been made, and CTV News regrets this error.

It’s a rarity that I have a whole chicken in the house and after devouring Heston’s perfect roast chicken on Saturday night I figured, waste not want not, I’m making me some stock!
Here is what you will need to make your very own home made chicken stock ice cubes. Recipe is courtesy of BBC Food.
- Bones from a cooked chicken
- 1 Carrot, peeled & chopped
- 1 Onion, peeled & quartered
- 1 Stick of Celery, chopped
- 6 Black Peppercorns
- 1 Dried Bay Leaf
- 1 Sprig Thyme
- 3 Sprigs Parsley
Note:
The shop around the corner from me didn’t have celery or parsley so I made do without but if you can, obviously get them. (Don’t judge me, It was a Sunday & I was being lazy!) I also added the basting juices leftover from cooking the Ultimate Roast Chicken.
First up, throw all the ingredients into a large heavy based pan.
Cover the ingredients with cold water, place on the stove & bring to the boil. Skim off any scum that surfaces.
Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for about 3 hours.
Strain the stock through a sieve or some muslin into a large bowl. If you will be using it within three days, allow to cool completely, skim off the fat that surfaces to the top & refrigerate until needed.
If you aren’t, return the stock to a clean pan. Crank up the heat and boil vigorously for about an hour or until reduced by half.
Cool the stock completely then skim off the fat that surfaces. Pour the stock into ice cube trays and freeze. When frozen, put cubes (or sea shell shapes in my case!) into a bag and store in the freezer.
When you want to use one, simply put in a jug and add boiling water to melt the cube. Or just throw into a pan with your ingredients for a more concentrated flavour.
Hope I’ve inspired you to not waste those carcasses!
Go forth and make stock my friends.

stuffed chicken roasted...make it atleast a couple of times..I do a diff version.. I always end up with leftover stuffings...love ur idea of using a chicken breast...About the incident at B'bay//Like always the blame game is going headstrong....
ichiri pada alle...:-))ennalum looks good...
That is a really cool idea to use the chicken breast.... It looks absolutely delicious, I am bookmarking this to try! BTW, try Cornish game hens for the whole chicken recipes for 2.
my sis in law and i used to stuff chicken whole and cook it in the microwave. the stuffing mainly had tons of onions, tomatoes, bread, potatoes, ginger-garlic and what not. There was no set recipe, we just used to follow some recipe blindly. and each time it rocked. wish we had thought of adding boiled egg at that time. this looks delicious!
It is true Mish, but that stuffing actually came from Arabs.. If u r here, I will have reached there to taste this.. :)
Hi ShnThis simply looks amazing,must try it out soon. I tried your chicken stew, i did not get your white colour but I had sauted the onions till it became a golden brown, maybe that's why.It hurts so much to see our country burning.
I like that brainwave of stuffing breasts instead of a whole chicken! On another note, the terror attacks were scary, like watching a movie tho' this was very real!
One of the best place for kerala dishes is here. This is really awondrufl dish. My mom used to make stiffed roast chicken when we were in holiday in my dads native place. But this one is really yummy looking. I liked the idea of you going them with chicken breast. I am sure bookmarking this recipe.Stuffing goat with chciken that is new to me.Love to hear more about this, when you get mails about this unusual recipe, not that i will make the goat dish, just curious
I haven't heard of a goat stuffed with chicken stuffed with eggs. Must be something like a turducken(turkey stuffed with duck stuffed with chicken!) they make here in the US? Also stuffing with puttu mix is also new to me. I love the malabari stuffed whole chicken, but I don't make it often. Stuffing chicken breast is such a wonderful and smart idea!...and it looks too good.
I have eaten stuff chicken in sis place. Her MIL makes it, the stuffing is simple fried rice and then the whole chicken is fried and has counconut milk gravy kept in side . Its yummy. But chicken, egg, lentil,OMG, you have kicked it up a notch. pakka veg now. will try it soon esp since u have admited it is a awesome dish. My bleed for mumbai
Oh my Mishmash! this one is a killer! I ll defnitely try this someday. and the terror attack is sickening, din kno abt te 75 kg mutton tho, read somewhere that they ordered 10 kilo biriyani :o what is the world coming to!
very impressive...you have put two of my favourite things in there...chicken and eggs..;-DChicken roast used to be my favourite with parotta..long time since I had that as well..Ee recipe would surely be tried out next year..I am too lazy to cook anymore this year....;-P
Yes, you are right about the goat being stuffed with a chicken and the chicken stuffed with eggs. In Northern Kerala, this is a delicacy among the muslims and is done the day after a wedding for the groom, or during a large salkaram(party). Your chicken looks absolutely mouth watering. Got to try it.
wondeful..you are one hardworking person..:)I have heard about this dish in malabar ,in which first chicken is stuffed with some eggs +gravy and then it is filled with tons of onion-tomato-masala gravy in a fried goat..one hell of a dish..served during iftars and all..
Rachel, Thanks for the link...your stuffing is lil different...but thats something you can use in a sandwich too....so it's actually good to have leftovers :DRas, kurachu pani undu..pakshe it's all small scale preps...so wont really feel the effort...but takes time to put everything together :) Thanks!Sig, thanks a lot....you should try.. make the stuffing in advance to save some time....I was having some mind block towards cornish hens...i think i must give a try sometime soon.Nags,boiled egg is common in most places back home for such a dish...i have heard a combo of boiled egg + bread and potatoes....Seena, Thank you very much for confirming ...yeah , even i was thinking it is the arab influence as i have heard about this stuffed camel dish in Saudi..perhaps, when they came here they didnt see any camel, so the next best thing they could think of was stuffing a goat :D i guess there they stuff a baby camel with lamb...btw, veetil varumbo paranjittu varane...eppazhum ethonnum undavilla...njan nalla oru madichiyaa :)Maya, my chicken stew doesn't have white colour either...it has a creamy shade...dont brown the onion..stop at the transparent stage. Also with any meat stews, you wont get the same colour as in potato stew, coz of the stock produced ...beef stew has much a darker shade...Thanks for the feedback...quite glad to know you tried:)Jyothsna, i was impressed too :PHappy Cook, thank you very much...Do try and let me know.. :)well you can feed your curiosity now....some of the responses confirm the existence of such a dish :) I wish I could taste it once....RP, yeah similar to turducken but here they go one step beyond the bird category and use red meat too. From the comments I recieved, such a delicacy exists...part of the arab traditions left behind....in line with their stuffed camel:) if you re using chicken breasts, you can make your fav prep more often,isn;t it? :)Pooja, ayyo enthu pattee veg'n now? noyambu aano? the stuffing u mentioned and the coconut milk gravy is new to me.....so if u have some leftover fried rice u can stuff a chicken right...much easier :)Vidya, thanks:) btw, 10 kg biryani...hmm..so they were really in for a sumptuous meal...read somewhere that they had dry fruits too..!Mathew, porotta and beef fry njangallkku vendi koodi kazhikkane....ho...orthittu vaayil vellam varunnu :( pls cook something and eat,else amma will think u were 'pattini 'there seeing all the aakraantham :DMy comfort food, thanks a bunch for confirming this :) i have heard about the sumptuous feast during salkkaaram......i wish i could be a part of it sometime :)Varsha, haha...thanks :) ho u made me more hungry.....!! now i really want to taste this dish....thanks a lot for dropping by and confirming it :)Shn
stuffing chicken breast is a good idea. Looks so mouth watering...wish i was at that table.
I did read the comments. Aparetnly it is famous dish, i would also like to try once that goat dish. One never knows maybe in a trip to a part of indian and suddenly you see this in a place ;-)
hi mishmash, i read about this stuffed dish in 'balarama' children s mag long ago..they were telling it s an arab preparation.. it doesnt end with the goat.. the goat is then stuffed inside camel and cooked.. hows that?
I would call this innovative cookin.. will def try this sometime and let u know :)
This looks absolutely delicious..even the stuffed chicken breast ,deep pan fried will taste great ...Somewhere I read about stuffing the Cornish Hen cuz they are small and easy to handle..Not so sure about it ..may be you know it already...hugs and smiles
What a gorgeous dish, Shn.And yes, all the craziness breaks one's heart :-(
Just the other day a friend was talking about egg-in-a-chicken-in- a-goat-in-a-camel thing! and there you have written about something similar ofcourse minus the camel and the goat:)!!(also saw the same mentioned in one of the comments-so perhaps he really was not bluffing:)!Interesting recipe Mishmash..Cheers
Awesome and I gonna try this soon. How interesting recipe is this. U have decribed it so well Mishmash.
U ought to publish ur recipes in d newspapers here. Its such a pleasure to read ur recipes after going thro reams of disturbing newsprint. Hope someday all this comes to an end. Ending this note with a prayer that no such incidents occur in any part of my world. Let peace prevail. Btw the pictures are awesome. The recipe surely will be mindblowing.Jisha.
OMG..thats a beautiful picture shn!!!..really very inviting...
hi shn...i had missed out this post..this looks so new to me..have never heard of a naadan style stuffed chicken...
well, don't worry mishmash, your nutcracks hadn't loaded their boat with 75 kg of mutton, they had used that space for much more hot stuff, like ammunition. well, can you imagine gun-trotting guys running into a hotel carrying loads of mutton instead of bullets and grenades ! and, they did get time to sit down and wolf down biriyani and mutton ! beware of the media, that's all i have to say. some later reports were saying the guys were high on stimulative drugs, to keep hunger and sleep at bay, which is more likely. anyway, we all watched the incidents unfold for three days, live. and, yet to get over the whole mental trauma. so, what about those who were at the hotels, the CST and dear old leopold...
I bet this definitely helps with adding flavor to chicken breasts. I do think this sounds much easier than the other dishes you mentioned, very tasty too :). I'd like to share your recipe with our readers! Please let me know if you're interested.Best,Sophie, Key Ingredient Chief Bloggersophie@keyingredient.com
hi ,Actually im a big fan of ur recipes...i used to try almost ur recipes n coming gr8. but Sori to tel u this one was a failure...didnt net ny expectation after the long effort.i have taken the whole chicken stuffed from frnds home it was really heaven...but this stuffing didnt came so good ,just like a north indian dal inside....me really depressed
hi the stuffing was not so good as in traditional style
Yes it was owesome. Your imagination into making this dish tells, you are a cook! Really appreciate what you are doing.Thank you.

With my partner a whole ocean away from me, I’m not in a very lovey-dovey mood for Valentine’s Day. That leaves plenty of time to think about what allowed Love to sneak out of courtly ballads and Shakespearean plays and into the hearts of average Americans. And no, it’s not chick lit or rom-coms.
The long answer would involve reading Stephanie Coontz’s Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage – the story of how marriage made the historical shift from an economic arrangement to a partnership from which we expect love and companionship.
.
Oh, and by now we also expect hot sex for more years than humans used to live, period, from birth to death. Nearly 500 years ago, Martin Luther set us down this road when he rejected the Catholic insistence on procreative sex, and instead embraced pleasure in marriage. Luther liked marriage. He termed it a “hospital for lust.” Bear in mind that in those days, hospitals weren’t in the business of curing; they took the poor and the insane and the unwed-but-pregnant off the streets. They were a way of containing social problems. Bear in mind, too, that Luther thought women’s lot was to be wives and mothers, undoing some of Eve’s screw-up in the garden. Still, there’s a solid though wavy line from Luther to Susie Bright.
The short answer: If we feel free to love today – or to lust outside of of the old “hospital” – we can thank two things: 1) the right to say no to sex, the key prerequisite for sighing a breathy, enthusiastic YES, and 2) reliable birth control with legal abortion as a safe backup. From the Ohio Statehouse to the House of Representatives, these rights are under more ferocious fire than I can recall in the post-Roe era.
But it’s a holiday, and so instead of gloom, let there be satire! It’s the more festive response – and maybe more effective , too. Here’s Kristen Schaal of the Daily Show, mocking the piss out of the “No Taxpayer Money for Abortions” crowd.
I used this in class last week to illuminate rape myths, and students got it like never before. (Does this mean college administrators will one day replace me with a semi-random mix off the tubes?)
And I knew I liked Felicity Huffman anyway (Lynnette is my favorite housewife, of course) but now I’m besotted:
(Via Rachel at Women’s Health News – If you can’t see either clip from your blog reader, click on through and say hey while you’re here.)
Take that to your next Tea Party, and sip it!
Happy Valentine’s Day to all, especially to those of you who are celebrating it alone with chocolate, champagne, or blogging. (I’ve only got two out of three but am wondering why I am too cheap to open the champagne sans partner. Wandering off to the kitchen now to rectify what I can …)
From a crypt in the All Saints Church of Wittenberg, a baffled “WTF?!?” can be heard!
Thanks to the weirdness that is Twitter, Susie Bright actually saw this post and wasn’t sure if she should be flattered or queasy. I told her the former, for sure.
So I guess the “WTF?” resounded at both historical endpoints.

Oklahoma Man May Have Spontaneously Combusted, According to Sheriff
.
Now, this may seem more ‘X-Files’ than reality, but Lockhart says he can’t rule it out. Spontaneous human combustion—in other words, when a person’s body lights on fire without an external source of ignition—may seem far-fetched, but that hasn’t stopped the sheriff from considering it. “I think there’s only about 200 cases worldwide, and I’m not saying this happened,” said Lockhart. “I’m just saying that we haven’t ruled it out.”
The body was apparently discovered in the kitchen, after having burned for up to 10 hours. None of the furniture or other objects nearby seem to be affected, nor does there appear to have been any kind of struggle, which are key factors in Lockhart’s suspicions. He added, ”There was no damage to the furniture or anything around the fire, so it was a low-heat fire. … The body is burned, incinerated, like I’ve never seen before and it’s some kind of chemical reaction or something.”
Preliminary autopsy results revealed burns on Vanzandt’s trachea, which likely mean death was caused by smoke inhalation. But how did the smoke start? Vanzandt was a heavy smoker, so it’s possible a lit cigarette is involved. The overall condition of the body and the scene, though, is inconsistent with that explanation, according to Lockhart.
“A cigarette burn will not do that,” he said. And the mystery continues …

Does Your Brain Need a Break?
One of my favorite summertime indulgences is simply doing nothing.
Some people might consider it a waste of a day, but to me, there is nothing better than grabbing a towel/blanket/mat/chair, heading to the park or the beach, and just lounging out in the sun.
Some of my best ideas have surfaced when my mind and body are otherwise disengaged — and according to various psychological studies, there is science behind random “aha” moments like the ones I have experienced.
If you think about it, it makes sense. Our minds are prone to over-thinking things. For example, how many times have you been stuck on a crossword puzzle clue because you keep thinking of the same answers over and over again, even though your mind knows those answers are incorrect? And how many times has the correct word popped into your head after you’ve put the puzzle down for a while?
Researches estimate that about 60 percent of complex problems are solved as the result of the “aha” phenomenon that often follows mental vacations. Giving your brain a break not only halts the cycle of stale ideas, it clears the way for your mind to pick up on subtle signals that it otherwise would have been too distracted to notice — signals that could pave the way to a creative breakthrough.
Allowing yourself some quality R & R also tends to improve your mood, and your brain is better able to think when it is not overloaded with negative thoughts.
So go ahead — lounge in your hammock, catch a few rays by the pool, or just chill on your couch for a bit. Your brain will thank you.<<

Supposedly nowadays you can play Dwarf Fortress at the console, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your perspective. The 40d19 version for Linux which was released a few months ago allows you to set some options and send output to the console instead of its conventional SDL “translation,” if I understand it right.
For me it’s kind of a bad thing, since it draws me back toward the game again, and it took weeks for me to break away from it last time. I have gotten tips from people on how to get it working, but my results are not very impressive.
That’s a step forward for me, but there’s something missing.
An email suggested using fbterm — which we all remember as the magic behind the wallpapered console, right? — plus the Terminus font, but to be honest, I don’t know if that’s better.
Maybe a little more readable, but nothing to distinguish between different icons and a lot of screen artifacts, if I can use that word for a console environment.
It does appear to be some sort of font issue though, where the default arrangement is spattering stuff everywhere. Perhaps there is a better font, or some other flag that I should be aware of. I suppose I should mention that starting the same setup under X was more or less the same.
Interesting though, that the music works fine for me at the console, and while it’s visually discombobulated, it’s still playing as it should. I just can’t see what I’m doing.
For future reference, I set this up by installing the dependencies listed for the graphical version of Dwarf Fortress in the Arch Linux repositories, then decompressing the 40d19 version into my home directory.
Inside the data/init/ folder is an init.txt file, and the magic happens by setting the PRINT_MODE variable to TEXT. I would also suggest sifting through some of the other variables, since most of them will be set for a graphical environment, and you will probably want to turn them off.
For fbterm, this is the command that was suggested by Kyle a couple of months ago.
fbterm -n "Terminus" -s "12" --font-width="12" --cursor-shape=1
Kyle also mentioned that sub-1Ghz machines suffer even with the console version, which may or may not be good news to you, depending on your perspective. For me, that would be a good thing … because it means less time lost playing Dwarf Fortress on a leftover Pentium.
In any case, if you’ve had better luck than me, please let me know how you got it going cleanly. I don’t need the distraction, but I do like challenges.
I’ve been looking at DF a couple of times, it is something that looks really interesting about it, it’s just that it looks so complex, so I’m thinking that it is a bit much for me, I mean I still haven’t managed to get deeper than 6 levels in stone soup, and that more or less blows my mind already
that is a lot of fun though
Well. This looks like UTF-8 with the terminal set to something else. I’ve had the same problem back then…
Maybe try the newer 0.31.11 version:
Maybe it’s using xterm’s 256 color extension, fbterm supports it but you have to set TERM to “fbterm”
That’s a good idea. I’ll try that the next time I install it, and see if it has any effect.
I’ve been wondering how long it was until you picked this up
Unfortunately I was hoping you would have clear-cut instructions, as I’ve been having the same issues
I don’t think this could help you in your actual problem, but I’ve found you can play the win version with the linux sh file (wich is nice for all the only-windows-mods of DF)
I notice similar display errors when playing Nethack with DECgraphics option on in fbterm
Slight update – the Terminus font has a few issues. But I made a little tool that will convert DF’s PNG tilemaps to a TTF font for fbterm to use. Naturally, it works best on the “simpler” ASCII-esque tilesets.

Search Patterns is not a technical book: it’s about design and user experience. It’s about what people prefer, what people are used to and what people would benefit most from when it comes to searching. And no, it’s not just about searching the web at the desktop: the book also presents some examples of searching on your mobile or even on TV and on kiosks.
The book starts reflecting on how search is so often synonym of “the box”. We are now at a moment in time when we need to question that box and think outside of it.
The anatomy of search, as the authors put it, is made of five elements: users, interface, engine, content and creators. All these elements influence and most support several patterns of behavior.
How can we change design to improve the search experience is a key part of this book. A whole chapter is dedicated to the principles of search design:
- incremental construction
- progressive disclosure
- immediate response
- alternate views
- predictability
- recognition over recall
- minimal disruption
- direct manipulation
- context of use.
And then, we go into the design patterns:
- autocomplete
- best first
- federated search
- faceted navigation
- advanced search
- personalisation
- pagination
- structured results
- actionable results
- unified discovery.
Search Patterns is not the type of book I typically review for KMOL. So, why did I decide to review it? Three reasons.
First, I am unfortunately too aware of how user experience design is so often disregarded. And, yet, it can be a make or break in a project. It is important to help non-designers see the impact it can have and provide guidelines, ideas and examples of how to do it better.
Second, knowledge management is a lot more than the tools and certainly a lot more than data and information. However, finding information, data and knowledge, easily, in the right format and when we most need it is one of the main challenges of organisations today. Looking at this challenge from the “search” perspective is a great complement to the usual KMers perspective: creation and storage.
Third, search is like an octopus that extends its arms in many different directions, feeding from and impacting many different areas. Reflecting about search is reflecting about people, information architecture, taxonomy, context, business strategy, etc.. And these are all core to proper, strategic knowledge management.
I have to say I really enjoyed the book. It’s written in a simple, yet almost poetic, way and includes loads of illustrated examples. It’s a great book for designers and user experience professionals, but also information science professionals, developers and knowledge management professionals.
In the book’s companion site you can find information about the authors and also many of the examples shared in the book – Peter Morville and Jeffery Callender.

I’m all out of kilter – I’ve tried somewhat weakly to follow the draft during the offday but.. I don’t know these kids. Someday, one of them will be the next big furor the fans are bashing Gardy (or whoever) for not bringing up because he’s clearly read… I will be able to say “I remember when…” but I’m not sure I really will remember.
Injury updates: Orlando went on the DL today (however belatedly) and he’ll be eligible to return to the lineup on the 15th. Hardy got a cortizone shot in that troublesome wrist and he should be able to return much sooner. But he’s still out tonight so the lineup still looks a little wonky – glad to see Cuddy back out there though!
This was not quite the pitchers duel that I had anticipated… seems like we broke Grienke last year because our guys sure have figured out how to hit him now – at least they could tonight. But for all that, Kevin Slowey held up his side of the duel and pitched his butt off.. great outting. For that, the Chat gave him BOD!! For all that fun hitting, we give pastries to Valencia, Kubel, and Span – he’s so glad to be back home! We also would like to present a Cuban sandwich and our deepest thanks to Joe Nathan for such great fun in the broadcast booth without forgetting that there was a game on the field! Joe, you have a future beyond pitching!

A shooting victim is refusing to cooperate with a Kokomo Police Department investigation, leaving detectives to pursue other witnesses.
Darius Liggin, 23, Kokomo, was found shortly before 4:30 p.m. Saturday outside the St. Joseph Hospital Emergency Room. He had a gunshot wound to his left leg and a cut on his left arm.
With Liggin not talking, Detective Mike Banush said the investigation has turned toward the driver of a car caught on the hospital’s surveillance cameras.
“The video shows the victim literally being dumped out of the car,” Banush said.
ABOVE: Video taken from security cameras at St. Joseph Hospital on a man being dropped at the hospital with a gunshot wound to the leg.
The passenger door was not even closed as the driver pulled away, he said.
The video shows Liggin lying on the road near the entrance of the hospital, struggling to pull himself toward the building for 2 minutes before someone entering the hospital notices him. A few moments later, several hospital employees rush to his aid.
Banush is looking for the public’s help in locating the vehicle and, in turn, the driver, whom police believe has information about the shooting.
Police are unsure of the make and model of the car, describing it only as a two-door, light-colored sports car. They have, however, released a photo of the car taken from the surveillance video.
“It’s not a common car,” Banush said.
Banush asks that anyone with information about the vehicle contact him at 765-456-7278 or the Kokomo Police Hotline at 765-456-7017. You may qualify for a cash reward by calling the Central Indiana Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS with your anonymous tip.

The Rolling Stones Release ‘Grrr!’ Gorillas Worldwide
Many of the world’s most well-known landmarks are being overrun by gorillas! To help promote their new ‘Grrr!’ greatest hits package, the Rolling Stones have unleashed 3,000 of the hairy beasts to top structures like the Empire State Building, Big Ben in London and the Sydney Opera House.
Perhaps the best part is only a small portion of the population will be able to see the animals. It’s another advantage of downloading the band’s uView app. By pointing your smart phone at one of the structures in 50 cities worldwide, the gorilla will come to life. You can then take a picture, and email it in to compete in a contest for prizes. Or you can send it via twitter to @RollingStones including the #GRRR! hashtag.

I know it's a little early, but I won this Itty Bitty and I had to use it right away!
I used the sketch from My Unity Place's challenge.
The paper is from Making Memories Spellbound and The Girls Paperie Toil and Trouble. The swirls were punched out of some textured paper that was given to me as a gift. The punch is from EK Success.
The die cut was cut using a Nestability. I sponged it with Tim Holtz Distress Ink. The orange is from the ribbon. It was white seam binding that was sprayed with Pumpkin Pie Tattered Angels Glimmer Mist. While it was still wet I dabbed it on the die cut. I thought it left some interesting texture.
The stamp is part of the Itty Bitty set, Witching Hour.
I added some black rhinestones for a little pop :)
Thanks for stopping by!
Have a fantastic day!

Collectible company Hot Toys wasn't going to let an Iron Man 2 license go by without at least one figure based on the film's aesthetic highlight: Scarlett Johansson in a tight, tight jumpsuit.
Sure, they've done one for Iron Man, and one for War Machine too, but those are dude's in robot suits. That's easy. Having to capture the human form, that's a little harder, and while Black Widow's body looks as it should, the face just looks a little...off. I think it's the open mouth. Like it was the world's tiniest, most intricately-detailed Scarlett Johansson blow-up doll.
If you're not put off by a slack-jawed superhero, this will be out towards the end of year, stand around 28cm tall (1/6 scale) and will cost a lot.

In the summers of my school years I delivered flowers, taught karate and once had a lemonade stand. But I never had a video game summer job. If I did, maybe I'd have imitated 14-year-old Giovanni Holmes.
Giovanni is running a video game website this summer. He's trying to turn it into a social network. And his dad is paying him nine Canadian dollars an hour to do it, for five hours a day, Monday through Friday.
Why'd he start this gig? "My dad wanted me to get a summer job."
What are his hours? "From when I wake up until five hours later."
Nice!
Away from the shine of the sun, Giovanni Holmes has secured himself one terrific summer job.
He's done better than our own Luke Plunkett, who, in 2003 tolerated a single summer selling games at an Electronics Boutique.
He's got a more lucrative summer gaming gig than our own Brian Crecente did as a precocious kid, who spent the summer of '82 running an Atari arcade, charging other kids 10 cents to play a game, just a nickel if they could beat him (that's crafty of you, boss!).
Giovanni's video game summer job is arguably even healthier than that of our Michael McWhertor, who did a few summers working an arcade in Orlando where he says that in the process of repairing pinball machines he occasionally electrocuted himself.
Giovanni has a friend who is delivering newspapers this summer. Terrible! The friend's uncle is in the newspaper business. He's got friends who do babysitting. "I baby-sat once," Giovanni told me during a phone interview. "I don't hate it. If they're good kids it's not so bad."
Newspaper delivery and babysitting may be nice, but they are not the thing Giovanni describes the building of video game websites as: "a growing market." More people are playing games, he reasons, and more of them are reading about games on the Internet. Because of this, when Giovanni's dad was nudging him to think about a summer job way back in April, Giovanni decided to build on dad's own profession as a website designer and craft a site of his own about video games. Giovanni's a gamer, of course, with his very own Xbox 360 that overheats from time to time.
As spring turned to summer, Giovanni launched MoneyGamerz. He writes video game articles on it, based on news he picks up from sites like this one. He does that to keep people visiting, a necessary task to building a social network. The article writing is the hardest part, he told me. "If I get an idea from IGN or your website I won't copy the article word for word. I'll change the sentences around and make sure the article is my own."
The real purpose of the site, however, isn't to inform but to build a community of gamers. That's where the MoneyGamerz points system kicks in. Refer a friend to the site and get them to register. You wind up with points. Comment. You get points. Do this enough and you can cash those points in for free games or even consoles (you have to comment a lot for that.) This is not an easy plan to execute. Giovanni says his site currently has just 36 members and he hasn't thought through the economics of the points system, whether, should MoneyGamerz be a bigger hit than the average lemonade stand, he and his dad could afford to give everyone the consoles their points would earn them. "I'm not really obsessing over the numbers," he said. "I kind of want it to grow on its own."
Giovanni says he likes his video game summer job better than he thought he would and can see a future that has him working in the gaming market when he gets older. He was expecting this summer work stuff to not be much fun. Now he wants to work extra hours. With a pay scale like he's got, it beats mowing lawns.
Have you ever had a video game summer job? Tell us about it below.

S Visceral Games at the helm, the franchise is being fine-tuned with a gold and chrome toolkit.
The Devil's Cartel doesn't remove anything that made Army of Two great, especially Aggro, which determined how enemies decided on which player to attack based on the player's aggressiveness. The more firepower one of two cooperative players lays on the enemy, the more the enemy combatants focus their attention on the rainmaker. Only in The Devil's Cartel, Aggro isn't a visible feature. It happens all in the background. Players don't get a bar that shows who's nearly invisible and who's the wedding singer; they'll just have to figure that out on their own.
In my playtime, that determination was easy to tell. It's common sense when the bad guys are more interested in your partner than you, or vice versa. Not having a gauge to tell players that they have a bigger target painted on their back actually makes the game a more challenging and fun. Of course, it also makes strategic strikes using Aggro more difficult to pull off…but more rewarding when done right.
Every other aspect of the game has undergone significant improvements, from graphics thanks to Frostbite 2 to the friendly AI for solo players actively changing its behavior based on player gameplay. Previously marketed features like gun customization and a wardrobe that would please an 18th century czarina return with little to no change. The biggest difference from switching developers is really the two protagonists, or rather, the toned down testosterone levels. Rookies to Tactical Worldwide Operations (TWO of Army of Two), both are just starting out for the PMC. There's hesitation, discretion, and minimal carefree swagger. That doesn't mean that Salem and Rios are gone for good; Visceral has confirmed that the buddies are still kicking it for TWO, but they aren't playable characters. What their role is has yet to be revealed.
The 10-hour campaign, while seemingly short, will include a number of different game modes beyond the drop-in cooperative play. They will all be cooperative, but Visceral declined to share details about those different modes. And to match with the story, cooperative play will always be two-player. If you're a solo gamer, you may end up enjoying the The Devil's Cartel even more because you don't have to deal with the most heinous of gamer problems: bad teammates. The friendly AI, while not yet fully developed, will be player-commanded via the D-pad, and its play style will be partially determined on the weapons loadout players assign. Give it a sniper rifle and it'll play a support role, or a shotgun to quickly take on Aggro early in a firefight.
Additionally Visceral has introduced a new feature called Overkill, which makes players practically invincible and super-powerful for a few seconds. One or both squad mates can activate it, and when combined they double the strength of firepower again. Destructible environments just turn into mush and enemies…well, into limbless husks.
The cooperative game wouldn't feel right without a lot of cinematic treatment and gusto from heavy action sequences, but it won't ever be just watching. The trailer showed just one aspect of that, where after one rookie catches the other from plummeting to his doom, a helicopter comes out of nowhere and the cinematic turns into a special section of gameplay where both players have to shoot the chopper down…while hanging on to each other. Cinematics will never be about sitting back and watching according to Visceral; if you're watching, you aren't playing.
Maybe the key to making a highly successful Army of Two game lies in the franchise's core concept — cooperation. EA Montreal set the play and passed the ball. Now it's up to Visceral to run with it.
Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel will release in March 2013.

Super Bowl preview for non-football fans Feb 01 2013
If you don't know anything about football and yet are interested in (or being coerced into) watching the big game this weekend, here are some players' stories that might make it more interesting for you..
I loved this line in reference to Colin Kapernick's replacement of Alex Smith as the 49ers' starting QB:
The deliberate, steady bus was replaced by a flaming Apache helicopter flown by a nude Vladimir Putin.
Bonus: nothing about the Harbaugh brothers.

Singer Dana reveals her bare forehead and shows off her baby-faced beauty.
On April 9th, Dana wrote a message on her Twitter,
“On my way^^* It’s been a long time since I’ve had regional schedules!”
Together with the message was a set of four selcas, in which Dana is wearing a yellow hooded sweatshirt and making cute expressions towards the camera.
In particular, her hair has been all pulled back and tied up into a bun in the back, revealing her forehead as if she were ready for a sports field. With a forehead larger than people thought, fans were quite shocked, but seeing her well-defined features was enough to divert their attention.
Her tidy hairstyle that did not leave even one hair obscuring her face actually worked to Dana’s advantage and drew even more attention to her slender face and cute charms. The light makeup on her face brings out an innocent and pure beauty that is making male fans exclaim with admiration for the singer.
Netizens complimented and joked about Dana’s photos,
“Perfect baby face”
“How is she so cute”
“I would believe she was a grade school student”

Toy Fair: Markers That Don't Blot Walls, Sand Without The.
Vast acres of displays baldly appeal to the nostalgia of today's 30-to 40-something parents. Whole city blocks worth of booths are crammed with Mario Bros., Pacman and Star Wars figurines, Hello Kitties, Slinkies, and Big Wheels The main difference between those toys of thirty years ago and today, it seems, is the presence of USB ports.
More than 30,000 people have registered to attend Toy Fair this year.
Actual children are not allowed.
It's all buyers and sellers, makers and takers. The biggest trends besides nostalgia are building toys — the most popular toy segment on the market right now — and toys tapping into design and style, exactly what parents tend to follow on their favorite TV reality shows.
Kids have always enjoyed imitating the ways of grownups in play. And sure enough, my own unofficial survey of the 1,000-plus booths revealed trends in temporary tattoos and extravagant fake mustaches. One booth sold a combination: fake mustache tattoos. Had it also involved a nostalgic nod to ZZ Top, that booth may well have been mobbed.
Some of the biggest purveyors of play — Lego and Crayola, for example — did not have booths at Toy Fair. Instead, they had fortresses: Giant, bright dividers guarded by stern PR types separated casual lookie-loos from the trendiest, most cutting-edge, new toys.
One had to be approved in advance for an appointment. The Crayola people kindly took me around for a private tour. That's where I learned that holiday shopping season starts in late summer for the biggest toy makers. (It takes that long to create buzz.)
Among the Crayola products coming out in July are magic markers that magically only write on proprietary paper developed by the company. That way, when your three-year-old wreaks havoc with a fat red marker and scribbles all over the couch, the walls and herself, the only visible red marks will be seen on that special Crayola paper.
The company's also developed digital graphic design tools allowing young children to play with digital effects with their drawings and photos, including airbrushing — a skill I suppose can't be taught too early these days.
Innovation was hardly lacking outside the corporate compounds. I was fascinated by the "Sand Puff," perhaps best described as high-tech sand. Imagine lighter, fluffier bread dough, but sandy. It's malleable enough to twist and mold into shapes — even castles! — but also fun to stretch, finger and tear. Sand Puff comes from South Korea and it's made, said the booth attendant, from "seashell powder and natural moisturizing oil."
Stuffed animals have somehow gotten even cuter since I was a kid — more cuddly, more personable, more convincing. It's possible my favorite toys at the fair were the plush horses, as large as Newfoundlands, so soft and sensitive you could almost hear them nicker. Best of all, they're outfitted like tricycles, so you could actually ride these giant stuffed animals around.
I mean, you could if you were little.

4 Comments to “Parents Say Teacher Forced Son to Eat from Trash — Wendy Burch Reports”
February 6, 2013 at 1:32 PM
Yeah, that boy looks like he doesn't get enough to eat…
February 6, 2013 at 2:30 PM
I am so disappointed that this was chosen as "news" this morning. I applaud the teacher and think the parents need to teach their child not to throw his food away.
February 6, 2013 at 3:28 PM
If he is such a picky eater then why wouldn't this mother be making his lunch for him instead of having him eat the school lunches….. But I do think the child needs to know he needs to eat his lunch when it is time to eat then can play when he is finished since he probably just wanted to go play instead of eat.

Best pop band, ever?
Who would you say?
First, some guidelines:
- The Beatles are a given, so leave them out.
- It has to be a band with multiple hits. If you want to list your personal favorite that isn’t actually popular (as in, underrated, or enormously influential and critically acclaimed, but never had any hits), go ahead, but also include a band who is actually popular.
- No solo artists.
So who do you think? Jackson Five? Fleetwood Mac? The Police?
(Yeah, yeah, I’m not including a definition of pop. Arguing over it in the comments is half the fun.)
Posted on May 6, 2008, in Music. Bookmark the permalink. 99 Comments.
The thing that puts Fleetwood Mac in the running for me is they have three different singers that all had hits. And each of them were such great song writers. Rumors is as close to a perfect album as you can get, I think.
But the Police…I don’t think they ever wrote a bad song. You listen to their box set and every single song is great. At their peak they were the hugest band in the world.
This is a toughie now that you’ve eliminated the obvious answer.
U2 or REM, I’d say. They are definitely overlapping into the pop world. Fleetwood Mac is a good call, but next people will be mentioning Eurythmics, and we can’t have that. The Pretenders? Lloyd Cole and the Commotions?
OK, U2 might take it.
Yeah, I’d have to say U2. Even if you had asked for best R&B band, I still would have picked U2. I’m consistent that way…
U2?? Seriously?? They’re so much more popular State-side of the Atlantic than here. I don’t get why people like them so much. I like a couple of their songs, but mostly I think they’re overrated.
Them’s fightin’ words, Rebecca…
U2 has been consistently amazing (recorded and live) for over 3 decades. Their lyrics blow me away; their musicality is flawless. Not only do they have the universal appeal, but they connect on an intimate level. They are just fabulous.
well, they’re not THAT good. But best pop band? Sure.
Pop band not the Beatles? Rolling Stones, The Supremes, Beach Boys, the Who, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Band, the Jam, the Smiths, Van Halen.
U2 is indeed overrated.
First off, “Don’t Stand so Close to Me ’86″ is quite possibly one of the worst songs of the 80s.
Best pop band ever? REM.
Greg, someone’s got to provide fodder for the U2-haters!
But of the ones you list, I’d say only The BB, Supremes and CCR count truly as ‘pop’.
Squeeze?
(Weren’t they billed a The Beatles Lite or something?)
I wouldn’t call CCR pop at all.
CW, there are soooooooo many worse songs from the 80s. In fact there may be more worse songs from the 80s than all worst songs of the other decades, combined.
My vote is for the Police.
The thing that puts Fleetwood Mac in the running for me is they have three different singers that all had hits. And each of them were such great song writers.
You would be referring here to Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie, and Peter Green, I hope. (If only I could invoke Danny Kirwan, whose songs, alas, were never hits).
Anyway, I vote for the Mac minus Stevie Nicks.
When I think of “pop” I tend to think of infectious hooks and sublime melody, so it rules out a lot of the bands I love.
I’d vote for Crowded House.
New Order has a strong “pop” record, in my opinon, starting with Ceremony on down to their latest offering a year or so ago.
Though I’m not a big fan, I’d even give pop bands like Erasure and Pet Shop Boys some love. Both bands have a long list of sublime melodys and catchy hooks.
Also, though shortlived (only two albums), the Queen/Beatles-influenced band Jellyfish were pop geniuses.
So if a band becomes immensly popular, doesn’t it automatically become overrated (way too many people liking the same band for those with more eclectic/eccentric tastes).
Anyway…I just live for the moment when I turn on “Clocks” and my three-year-old exclaims “I just love that song!” so I think Coldplay should be listed. Oh and how could you all forget ABBA?
Yes, ABBA deserves consideration. As do the Bee Gees.
Coldplay too, at least for the 00′s.
Both my young boys love “Clocks” too. Hilarious.
New Order wasn’t popular enough. Ditto Crowded House, Erasure, or Pet Shop Boys. I don’t think Coldplay should even register, honestly. Good Brit pop, yeah, but best of all time?
Didn’t Stevie write “Landslide”? And “Edge of Seventeen”? Both awesome, awesome songs.
EmWJ: I’m looking for bands that weren’t overrated in their popularity. Hard to come by, I know.
Speaking of “Clocks,” does the mix with the Buena Vista Social Club get any airplay outside of DC? I like it far better than the original.
I’ll give Stevie “Edge of Seventeen,” but she did not record it with Fleetwood Mac so it doesn’t change my vote.
Jeeze. I’m not sure how to distinguish pop from non-pop. Are Pink Floyd or Led Zepplin pop? They both had pop hits. U2 definitely is although it’s not solely pop.
I think with Floyd there’s enough airplay on radio to count so that would be my choice. I’d put them above the Beatles for sure. Of course I’d put Elvis above the Beatles but he’s a solo act.
That Buena Vista Social Club cover of clocks just made me happy.
Another cover that I love is the String Quartet Tribute to Clocks. And just in case somebody hasn’t heard of the String Quartet Tribute, check them out to see if they have covered your fave pop/rock/other band…awesome sounds!
Ok, if we:
1. Exclude the Beatles and all solo acts (sorry Elvis and Mariah);
2. Give “pop” it’s broadest possible definition; and
3. If “greatest” means:
number of hit songs and albums x influence x longevity
then there’s only one possible answer: U2
It’s not even close. Overrated? I think not.
Spin Doctors
Rebecca, I feel the same way about U2- meh. Always have.
Pop? I mean, don’t the boy bands make pop? What about Genesis? Bee-Gee’s? Rolling Stones??
U2 is consistently very good, over a period of decades. In the age of radio they were played on rock, alternative and pop stations. They deserve to be mentioned as a serious candidate. Besides the fact that they make great music, one has to consider that they still haven’t split up or had a band member die yet. Considering rock history, their longevity is really amazing.
The other interesting thing with U2 is that they’ve had the same lineup for so long. One would have expected at least one band member to walk off at some point or one would have expected Bono to try out a solo career.
Setting aside the Beatles, I’m not sure if anyone else can really compete with U2.
I’ve been a major fan of the Smiths and Pink Floyd – but in regards to the specific question Susan is asking, I don’t think either of these bands comes close to U2.
My odd-ball candidate for a a great pop star that could have been: Edie Brickell. Instead she married Paul Simon and had three kids. I think she probably made the right choice – but I love some of her songs and I think she could have been huge if she had made music her life purpose.
Pink Floyd aren’t pop, are they? They’re acid rock.
Susan, I would have said the same thing. Oddly, I once heard David Gilmour in an interview referring to his music as “pop music.” Wasn’t sure what to make of that – but I decided I wouldn’t argue with him on the subject.
No Beatles? Then it must be Oasis!
[Bull Moose grins slyly, like Kevin on "The Office"]
#20, popular shmopular. Yes, popularity should be a factor, but if it were the overriding factor we could just give the award to U2 and go home. I don’t know, to me the more interesting question is “Who should have been the Best Pop Band Ever?” or who is overlooked as the best pop band ever.
Also, it is ironic to me that U2′s most “pop” album, at least according to the band — 1997′s Pop — was one of it’s biggest commercial and critical flops.
And why no love for Journey?
Susan (#30), that just highlights the problematic nature of ‘pop.’ To me ‘pop’ entails popular with numerous top 20 hits on Billboard. It’s hard to say Pink Floyd isn’t pop by that standard.
I mean I know what I disparagingly call pop music. Sort of the Christina Aguilaras, Britney Spears, or the like. But I’d have a hard time putting U2 or many other bands mentioned in that category.
One of the funniest things about the music industry is the changing and elastic definitions of terms like pop, rock, alternative, etc. There is a band I like that I have seen placed in all of these gengres at least once by various retailers: rock, punk, pop, hard-rock, alternative, pop/punk and emo. I’ll let you guess, if you care to, which band it is.
See here for Wikipedia’s list of genres under the category of “Rock.” It’s interesting to note that the main genres under Rock are:
Alternative rock
Blues rock
C-Rock
Dark cabaret
Desert rock
Garage Rock
Glam rock
Gothic rock
Hard rock
Heavy metal
Indie
Industrial rock
J-Rock
New Wave
Pop
Progressive rock
Psychedelic rock
Punk rock
Rock and roll
Southern rock
Surf rock
And everything else is a sub-genre of one of these main genres. So, according to this list, Pop is a subgenre of Rock, rather than the other way around, as is Rock and roll. Don’t know if I agree with that list, but there you go.
I won’t argue The Police’s influence and critical acclaim, but are we overselling their popularity?
Without question, during the Synchronicity album they were the #1 band (in terms of popularity) in the world from the standpoint of album sales, concert tickets, and general buzz. Prior to that they were a solid band with a respectable level of popularity, but they weren’t a mega-band.
But how many bands can say that? That at a given point in time they were the biggest band in the world? Any of the following bands: Van Halen, Journey, Def Lepard, Hootie, Oasis, Coldplay, even the Backstreet Boys.
Because The Police went out on top, we tend to project their popularity backwards and forwards.
In comparison, U2 reached Synchronicity-level zeniths at least three times — Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, and All That You Can’t Leave Behind — and maybe four.
I love The Police, but they didn’t achieve crossover mega success until their last album.
The band has acknowledged that the name of that album was not accurate. It was a rock album, although influenced by electronica.
Matt, I’ve got all kinds of love for Journey, Styx, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, Kansas Boston and Rush. But none of them come close to U2 in terms of the combined factors of widespread popularity, influence and longevity.
Funny, I’m listening to U2 right now (a b-side “Where did it all go Wrong” from Even Better than the Real Thing IIRC)
MCQ, I think the failure of Pop was that they needed about one more month in the studio. There are some great tracks on that album. The problem was that they wanted that media-savvy self-conscious irony that they’d started by Achtung Baby. But it had wore out its welcome. And, say what you will, but both Discoteque and the Popmart tour were very pop-focused. (Starting with the song Pop Music that they covered)
I agree that most of the other tracks were very unlike Discoteque though. And some when done later in stripped down acoustic versions were amazing.
Matt, wasn’t Ghost in the Machine just as big?
I agree though that the Police were very much part of the late 70′s counter-pop/disco movement. We remember them because they remained great more than their success at the time.
“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d vote for Crowded House.”
Well, that’s definitely where my vote would be as well. Esp. if we realize that the world is much bigger than the U.S.!
If we go by best selling no one comes close to the Beatles. Next up (outside of single acts) is AC/DC, ABBA, Bee Gees, Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, Queen, and the Rolling Stones. The Police are way down the list.
Clark: I understand the ironic media commentary they were going for with Pop, but I think people just didn’t get it. It fell flat. It was too clever by half.
Go back and listen to Discotheque. (OMG, I forgot how bad that video was—-ok maybe don’t click that link). I think Pop is a low point in an otherwise stellar catalogue of amazing, even groundbreaking music. But regardless of what you think of Discotheque, It’s a rock song. Listen to Edge’s guitar. There’s nothing poppy or disco-y about it. The album’s name was intended ironically, not as an accurate label of its contents.
BTW, I was at the PopMart concert in SLC and they did not cover Pop Muzik, (the song by M). They covered the Monkees “Daydream Believer.” They played a recording of a dance remix of Pop Muzik during the introduction to each concert. That remix was later released as the “Pop Mart Mix” on U2′s “Last Night on Earth” single, with new vocals by Bono.
I think your point was that they were trying to make a pop record or create a pop performance with that tour. I disagree. I think they were using a rock album to make a statement about pop music that was largely misunderstood or ignored.
Clark, I wouldn’t take that list as gospel, but even if we accept its accuracy (for the moment), it shows that the Beatles are the only “band” to have sold more than 500 million records.
But the bands you listed are shown as equal to each other in sales because they are listed alphabetically in the 200-500 million category. They could be very close to the Beatles, but just below the 500 million record cutoff; we just don’t know from this chart.
The next box is the 100-200,000 category and its equally ranked bands are: Aerosmith, Backstreet Boys, Beach Boys, Black Sabbath, Bon Jovi, Carpenters, Chicago, Deep Purple, Eagles, ELO, Fleetwood Mac, Genesis, Iron Maiden, KC and the Sunshine Band, Petshop Boys, U2 and The Who.
Those two lists of bands actually make a pretty good list to consider as contenders for greatest pop band ever. I still think U2 is the best on that list, but you could make a case for any of those bands (with the possible exception of the Backstreet Boys and Deep Purple).
Here’s my top 5:
1. The Kinks. I know people want to call them a rock band, but their best stuff has a pop riff that makes it so good. Think David Watts as they do it, not as The Jam do it.
2. The Temptations. OK, you might argue R&B isn’t pop, but you’re wrong. Great range, great songs.
3. The Beach Boys. Underrated as a novelty group, totally influential, so evocative.
4. ABBA. Groovy, singable, dreamy.
5. The Go-Gos. Great voices, sweet hooks, no pretension.
ABBA
Just for context, I really dislike both The Police and U2. I do like Achtung Baby, though. I like nothing by The Police.
Pop was far, far better than the preceding album, Zooropa which really only had one memorable song (Stay). Pop has some good stuff, “Please”, “If God Would Send His Angels”, “Gone”, “Do You Feel Loved”.
Aha. Brian V likes Achtung Baby. My work here is done.
(begin snarkiness)
No mention of Air Supply?
(snarkiness over)
I’m actually suprised that Bon Jovi (meaning the band, not the man) hasn’t gotten more discussion.
Yeah, he’s trailed off a bit, but the man was a huge influence in the 80′s and continued onward (though quality is something that is lacking).
Aerosmith is another that I’m suprised hasn’t gotten mentioned. I guess it does matter what your definition of “pop” is.
I don’t want to create a firestorm, but I’ve never liked U2. Ever. Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby included. I did like “The Wanderer” with Johnny Cash, but that was about it. Is there some U2 101 course I could take to understand this following?
The Carpenters
ABBA
Duran Duran (you know–of a certain era)
I almost feel like U2 should be exempted like The Beatles.
I think U2 should be exempted due to not being very good.
Uno, Dos, Tres, …. Catorce!
U2 could put out an album consisting entirely of burp and fart noises and critics would continue to rave. What an annoying, overrated band.
I have a U2 bias, since the first album I ever bought was WAR, and they were my first true love.
Air Supply was the first single I ever bought, though.
New Year’s Day was the first record I ever bought Susan.
Give a little love for Dave Matthews Band.
In 04, Rolling Stone did a list of the top fifty artists of all time. You can see it here.
Interesting to note that the top 10 “bands” are:
1. The Beatles
4. The Rolling Stones
12. The Beach Boys
14. Led Zeppelin
19. The Velvet Underground
22. U2
26. The Ramones
29. The Who
30. The Clash
32. Smokey Robinson and the Miracles
I might argue with the order of those bands a little, but it’s hard to argue with that list as the top ten bands of all time.
I look at DMB more folksy than pop
I don’t even know if I consider U2 to be pop
I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks they’re overrated
#52 – My thoughts exactly
Does Elvis Costello and the Attractions count? Because after The Beatles, they just might get my vote.
REM is a great rock band, and some of their stuff is pop, but most of it is not their best stuff.
The Kinks were great, but if you look at their career in total, they put out a lot of bad, bad music in the 1970s and 1980s.
Big Star.
A-ha
Might as well put Husker Du up there, Susan.
Another vote for the Beach Boys – it’s timeless(well, somewhat), catchy, fun.
Duran Duran was my favorite pop band of the 80s, been a while since they released a song I really enjoyed (Electric Barbarella, maybe.)
Modern pop, though… Does Pet Shop Boys count?
To you U2 haters, I think you can argue that U2 isn’t pop (I still don’t know what pop means, so until we define it better, it could mean anything), but anyone who seriously argues that U2 isn’t any good risks losing all credibility. If they’re in the hall of fame, they’re good, even if you don’t like them. Those are the facts, folks.
If theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in the hall of fame, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re good, even if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like them.
Are you sure you want to go there?
Sure, Brian, point out all the artists that are in the hall of fame that you don’t think are good. Be exactly that obnoxious, if you wish.
In so doing, however, please be aware that you are failing to recognize that if the overwheming weight of knowledgeable opinion is against you, your continued insistence on your perverse little isolated pont of view makes you appear as something of a moron.
There are just certain points of view that ought to be accepted as a given at some point. Not reasonably contestable. Those points include such things as sunshine being warm, gravity causing objects to fall downward, and U2 being one of the greatest bands of all time. Sorry to break the news to you, but there it is.
Define “good.”
And—Husker Du.
good
Ã¢â‚¬â€œadjective
2. satisfactory in quality, quantity, or degree: a good teacher; good health.
3. of high quality; excellent.
I’m not contesting your opinion, MCQ. However, the whole “if it’s popular that means it’s good” argument is a popular one but also, I feel, a misguided one. If this logic is to be believed, Milli Vanilli and New Kids on the Block are two of the best groups of the 90s, McDonald’s is the best food in the country, Friends is a great show, The Da Vinci Code is a great book, etc etc you get the idea.
There are just certain points of view that ought to be accepted as a given at some point.
Seriously? I couldn’t disagree more. “Good” is about as subjective as anything can get. Madonna’s in the rock & roll hall of fame. I think she’s terrible. If I don’t like something, it’s not good (to me), and I’m not going to force myself to try and like something just because most people do. You disagree with my taste? Great! I won’t try to force you to share my opinion.
I’d argue about that top 10. Seriously. Little Richie is #8 whereas Led Zepplin is #14 and Pink Floyd isn’t even anywhere on the list? Seriously? I mean I can see disputing order and all. But Zepplin at 14 and no Floyd? Note that both Nirvana and the Ramones are on the list. I love both. But no Floyd? I can see maybe not putting them in the top 10. But not even in the top 50? The guys who still outsell most of the rest of the top 50? The guys who had an album that stayed on the Billboard charts for 741 weeks!
Here I thought Brian V would point out that the nomination process for the R’n'R Hall of Fame is controlled by only a few people. (I think of the Hall of Fame as the Establishment. Why should I care what the Establishment thinks is good?)
I love these kinds of conversations even though they end up being futile.
Clark- I’m totally with your on the Floyd. It baffles me. They’re one of the best bands ever.
I can’t see the Ramones being in the Top Ten. Their recordings are fun to listen to on a certain level, but they were a three-chord band and sometimes they didn’t even play those three chords very well.
I saw them live once and was very disappointed.
They weren’t in the top 10. The top 50.
(…)but anyone who seriously argues that U2 isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t any good risks losing all credibility. If theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in the hall of fame, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re good, even if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like them. Those are the facts, folks.
You know how you lose all credibility? When you imply that everyone must accept your subjective tastes as a standard for “good” music, when you equate mass popularity and music industry self congratulatory a** kissing to quality, and when you start calling people morons because they don’t hold a bunch of self-obsessed publicity whore Irishmen in the same esteem as you. MCQ just won the triple crown of fanboy pretentiousness!
Hey, now. Bono is going to save the world, you know.
Clark, I agree with you about Floyd, they should be on that list, that is a glaring omission.
“if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popular that means itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s goodÃ¢â‚¬Â
No, that isn’t my argument. I’m not equating popularity, by itself, with being good. I’m suggesting that, after a certain amount of time has passed, and knowledgeable people have expressed a certain consistency of opinion, we ought to be able to accept certain points of view as a given.
I think that’s why Susan exempted the Beatles from this thread. It’s a given that they are the at the top of every list. Does that mean you have to like them? Certainly not. Nor do you have to like U2. Wouldn’t dream of forcing them on you. You can certainly say you don’t like them and good luck to you.
But if you are going to say they are “no good,” that’s another thing entirely. There has to be some minimum objective standard of merit, whereby we can agree that certain people or bands have passed the threshold where its reasonable to question whether they are any good. The piles of awards, accolades, top ten or top fifty lists just reach a certain critical mass where you have to just accept that they are good, whether you like them or not. I was using induction into the hall of fame as an example of that threshold, since it generally comes only after the test of time and many other awards and accolades have already been received. Perhaps that’s not a good example, but it’s certainly one possible measure.
So, kwk, I’m not asking you to “accept [my] subjective tastes as a standard for Ã¢â‚¬Å“goodÃ¢â‚¬Â music.” I’m asking you to accept that there is some objective standard, and that the only way to determine whether that objective standard is met, is by accepting that at some point, the weight of knowledgeable (not necessarily popular or public) opinion actually does mean something, and what it means is that at minimum, we accept that the artist is at least “good.” I don’t think that’s an earthshaking statement, nor is it stretching the bounds of credibility. I think it’s far more incredible, at this stage, to make statements about the Beatles or the Stones or yes, even U2, not being “good.” I think it should be accepted that they are good. How good? Well, ok, we can differ about that.
Bitter much? If you read carefully, you will see I didn’t call anyone a moron. I said certain points of view could make you appear to be something of a moron. Your point of view would be a good example of that. Calling U2 publicity whores is like calling George Washington an office seeker. You can’t fault people for playing the hand they are dealt to the best of their ability, especially when they use the benefits of their position to try to benefit others.
Pretty good for a kb thread, morons.
George Washington was a total sellout. His first year in office was his only good year.
Ha! Thanks Greg. How do you feel about baseball, hot dogs and apple pie? Total crap, right?
Well, it seems this argument, as most such arguments do, has become a semantic one. To my way of thinking, if I don’t like something, it’s not good (again, to me – this is subjective stuff). If I’m giving my opinion of something I don’t like, I’m going to express it this way. Why is that such a problem? And why does it matter how many rock critics before me have thought otherwise? I should just accept that my not liking The Band is a personal failing because Jann Wenner likes it? Or I should make some ridiculous clarification like “Oh, I guess it’s really good, it just doesn’t work for me”? I’ve got no time for that.
Plus, your argument raises a whole bunch more questions about these alleged tastemakers. If rock critics en masse are the ultimate judge of what’s good, do we need to examine their resumes before counting their opinion? I mentioned him already, but I’m as inclined to accept Jann Wenner’s opinion of what’s good as I am to jump out of a moving car for fun, and he’s one of folks in charge of the hall.
On a larger level, though, I find your idea that the majority rules (even if we’re talking “knowledgable” opinion (another quagmire, by the way) rather than popular) when it comes to rock & roll simply wrongheaded. Since when has rock & roll been about pleasing the majority of any group? Like Susan said, the establishment’s opinion of the quality of rock music means very little to me.
I’m sensing a lot of anger in the comments. And looking at the time the comments were made, I think some of you need to get some sleep.
Calling U2 publicity whores is like calling George Washington an office seeker.
Are we even talking about the same band here?
No one is going to get me to accept U2 as “good”, just like no one is going to convince me that a stale BigMac or a freezer-burned frozen burrito is good. I don’t like them. In the realm of music, or food, I would rather listen to, or eat, anything else. If you picked four random people off the street, could they make music as well as U2? Probably not. (Though I think it would probably be more interesting.) But in the context of all of the thousands of musical choices out there, U2 is near the bottom of my list.
It’s not that I don’t understand your point about critical acclaim given by those “in the know” establishing roughly defined standards. U2 is not Mozart, or Proust, or Da Vinci. They’re more like Kenny G. They are a mediocre-bad pop-rock act that spends more time hawking ipods and calling press conferences to commemorate their latest charitable donations than they do to making music that’s not derivative crap. They are good at at least one thing – getting aging hipsters with inferiority complexes to fork over money hand over fist.
I guess I’m am a little bitter, yeah. It’s because U2 and the incredibly overrated drivel that they put out finds it’s way into my life way too often. Come to think of it, in that sense it’s a lot like all the internet’s arrogant, self-anointed art authorities.
Well I think you missed my point again Brian, but I sense it’s not worth arguing about further. To clarify one thing though, I don’t think any one person’s opinion counts any more than any other’s. I don’t put any more weight on Jann Wenner’s opinion than yours, for example, nor do I recognize anything called “the establishment” (is that a rock band?).
I do, however, think that at some point you have to recognize that some measure of quality exists if years of accolades from multiple independent sources have shown that to be the consensus of people who should know what they’re talking about (meaning, other artists, among others). It’s very hip and cool to call that “the establishment” and say you don’t care what “they” think, but hundreds of people who have spent their lives playing, recording, and writing about music don’t all reach the same opinion for no reason.
kwk, you’ve convinced me, there’s no way we’re talking about the same band. You obviously have U2 mixed up with some other band. When you figure out who it is you’re really talking about, let us know.
ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very hip and cool to call that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the establishmentÃ¢â‚¬Â and say you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care what Ã¢â‚¬Å“theyÃ¢â‚¬Â think
First of all, I could care less about being cool or hip.
hundreds of people who have spent their lives playing, recording, and writing about music donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all reach the same opinion for no reason.
I don’t want to belabor my point by continuing to repeat myself, but people don’t all reach the same opinion about anything. That is what I’ve been trying to say, and if I’ve done a poor job of expressing that, I apologize. No band is unanimously loved, not even the Beatles. There are always going to be dissenters no matter what, and to say that they should just accept what the majority thinks is not an opinion I share. That sort of thinking, removed from the rather innocuous arena of pop music, has spawned some pretty ugly things (none of which I am accusing you of, just to be clear).
We’re still talking past each other Brian. I’m not saying that anything is ever unanimous. I’m just asking that people give me the (realitively minor) concession that an avalanche of supporters, accolades, awards and critical acclaim probably means that, at a minimum, something doesn’t totally suck. It might actually have some merit. Even if I don’t particularly care for it personally. You might say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one. I hope someday you will join us, and the world will live as one.
LOL.
I think Brian’s point is a good one. For instance outside of a few songs, I don’t like the Beatles. But I’d acknowledge them as the greatest band of all time.
I think it is possible to be able to distinguish between what I enjoy and what is good and probably even enjoyable to most people. This isn’t really a Big Mac like comparison. I think most people would like a well cooked meal by a top chef far more than a Big Mac. The fact that more Big Macs are sold has nothing to do with that. I think the same is true in music. The better analogy might be a perfectly cooked fish by an amazing chef. I may not like fish but I can at least acknowledge that a perfectly cooked fish by an amazing chef is good.
Thank you Clark, you stated that much better than I have.
You obviously have U2 mixed up with some other band. When you figure out who it is youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really talking about, let us know.
Obviously. Because it’s inconceivable that any opinion that is different from yours can hold any merit whatsoever. Yay for ad hominem attacks!
…but hundreds of people who have spent their lives playing, recording, and writing about music donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all reach the same opinion for no reason.
That’s why the Grammys are so good at determining the very best music every year. If you want to find all that is worth listening to in popular music, you can start and stop with music that has won Grammys!
Your “hundreds of people who have spent their lives playing, recording, and writing about music” are not the impartial, unbiased judges that you think they are.
kwk, take it easy, I’m just having a little fun with you.
BTW, I never said anything about the grammys. That’s just one award. By itself, it means little or nothing. Any one award or critic or accolade may be biased or flawed, but after 20 years of multiple awards, accolades, acclaim and applause from numerous independent sources, we might have something that is worth paying attention to, no?
I may not like fish but I can at least acknowledge that a perfectly cooked fish by an amazing chef is good.
No. U2 are not master craftsmen. Their music is not a “perfectly cooked fish”, it’s lazy, safe, uninspiring, preachy rock created by mediocre talents that gets polished by millions of dollars of production and hyped by an army of cultural elitists who never got over a pimple-y make out session to “One”.
Don’t hold back, kwk, tell us how you really feel. It must be hard to be constantly fighting that army of cultural elitists out there. How did U2 get that whole army of cultural elitists on their side, anyway? It seems kind of odd that four nobodies from Dublin could have accomplished that so successfully. Must have had an amazing PR man.
I’m obviously coming off like a ranting idiot here. I’m sorry. Like I said, I don’t disagree that certain artists are so talented that it becomes impossible to deny their talent. I just don’t think U2 is anywhere near that level, and it’s kind of irritating when obsessive fans discredit anyone who doesn’t acknowledge their dubious “facts”.
It’s obvious that U2 appeal to a certain aesthetic that I just don’t get. And as far as all their accolades and awards and etc. – I found that when I stopped listening to music that was getting all the major label music industry back-slapping I discovered music that was much more honest, rich, and innovative.
Not meaning to discredit you, just get you to agree with me!
Let’s hear about some of that other music, kwk. What are you listening to lately?
How did U2 get that whole army of cultural elitists on their side, anyway?
The same way that 50 Cent gained an army of urban worshipers and that made Creed the biggest rock band in the US – by filling a niche (a big one) and appealing to certain sensibilities and markets. I won’t argue that it takes a certain level of ability to get popular in the first place, but I think it’s pretty common for bands to ride the wave hype, luck, and a hastily given good reputation all the way to super-stardom.
I’ve just heard far too many rock bands that I think are far superior to U2 to feel OK about calling them “good” for the genre.
What are you listening to lately?
Lately, I’ve been hooked on Porcupine Tree and a band called “3″.
Don’t know those bands, but I’m going to look them up. Thanks!
